It's central aim is to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping a global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, with ambition to limit the increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Additionally, the agreement aims to strengthen the ability of countries to deal with the impacts of climate change.   \n",

When Christiana Figueres was tapped by the UN to lead the Paris climate conference (COP 21) in December 2015, she reacted the way many people would: she thought it would be impossible to bring the leaders of 195 countries into agreement on how to slow climate change. Find out how she turned her skepticism into optimism — and helped the world achieve the most important climate agreement in history.

       "      <td>I'm a Data Analyst who studies climate change initiatives and reporting of CO2 and other gases emissions by different companies from different industries by looking at their CDP and sustainability reports. My opinion is that climate change is a real threat, not only to humanity, but also for the planet. We still have time (although not much) to reverse the global temperatures hitting 2°C and keeping it below or at 1.5°C. If we hit the 2°C mark in the future, without caring about how much we, as humans, emit, then I can assure you that catastrophic events would increase such as hurricanes, typhoons, hotter summers and colder winters, which would not only affect human lives but would also be disastrous for the natural ecosystem as well. We need to put carbon taxes on energy and oil companies and educate more people, especially youth and children, on how climate change and global warming is and will affect us if we don't keep track of what we're doing. This is the reason many companies have SBTi (Science Based Target Initiatives) in place so that they can meet the 1.5°C or transition into a lower carbon economy within the next 20-25 years. We get it that we want more profits and revenues by keeping the world hooked on fossil fuels but at the cost of what? Your future? Your child's future? At the cost of our only planet we call Home? TBH, US is the 2nd largest emitter of CO2 emissions just after China.</td>\n",

Before the Trump administration took hold, a playbook was put in place, as to how to deal with a pandemic. Look at how the Obama administration dealt with H1N1 versus how the Trump administration is dealing with COVID-19, it went to show that the Obama administration tackled the crisis from the onset. Obama didn’t say to every U.S. Governor it’s only up to them to figure it out. Trump decided to concede responsibility for the pandemic, and the results are disturbing and evident. “I take no responsibility.” This pandemic has shown what taking no responsibility results in.</td>\n",

I wouldnt say i agree since it contributes to the lock-in of carbon energy technologies, but it does contribute to overal lower greenhouse gas emission in the current coal based power regime. Just typical China, trying to innovate their way out of it.</td>\n",

Both these guys need to watch it...geez couldnt be easier... why don't we just use fix the farming and solve Global warming and the disgusting way we treat our food we eat and the depleted veggies and fruits with zero nutrients we grow will creating deserts and using cancer causing chemicals on them.. if you haven't seen the documentary and u think the Paris Accord is a good idea I suggest you watch it it's on Netflix.  Kinda a big deal...and simple fix actually cuz our carbon emissions is really impacted by the massive farming we do...FACTS.. So take off ur mask ur carbon emissions arent the problem   \n",

       "15   I'm a Data Analyst who studies climate change initiatives and reporting of CO2 and other gases emissions by different companies from different industries by looking at their CDP and sustainability reports. My opinion is that climate change is a real threat, not only to humanity, but also for the planet. We still have time (although not much) to reverse the global temperatures hitting 2°C and keeping it below or at 1.5°C. If we hit the 2°C mark in the future, without caring about how much we, as humans, emit, then I can assure you that catastrophic events would increase such as hurricanes, typhoons, hotter summers and colder winters, which would not only affect human lives but would also be disastrous for the natural ecosystem as well. We need to put carbon taxes on energy and oil companies and educate more people, especially youth and children, on how climate change and global warming is and will affect us if we don't keep track of what we're doing. This is the reason many companies have SBTi (Science Based Target Initiatives) in place so that they can meet the 1.5°C or transition into a lower carbon economy within the next 20-25 years. We get it that we want more profits and revenues by keeping the world hooked on fossil fuels but at the cost of what? Your future? Your child's future? At the cost of our only planet we call Home? TBH, US is the 2nd largest emitter of CO2 emissions just after China.   \n",

Maybe you should really follow the money. It's clear as a bell YOU are guilty of what you accused me of, not researching and just believing whatever you hear. The proof is in the TRANSACTION. Hillary Colluded with Russia. Joe Biden colluded with Ukraine AND CHINA. This is undeniable by any rational person at this point who can actually read and research. Mkay? Thanks.   \n",

It doesn't seem much to you, but you should take a look at what's going on around the world due to this increase. Siberia's permafrost is melting extremly fast, deserts appear in Europe (for example, in Romania), hurricanes in the Mediteranean Sea, Venice underwater. Even in the US there is more extreme weather then ever before. \\nTake it like this: if the water rises above 1meter, all of US's military bases by the sea will be underwater. You, as a taxpayer, will have to pay WAY more in order to build new ones. This was said by the Pentagon in 2018. Search the report and read it. And this will happen in a decade.   \n",

You and a lot of other vaccine-police could end up dead.  i'm just saying.  force-vaccinating is not a joke.  It's the worst violation of people's individual rights imaginable.  Do you REALLY think that someone who believes the Fauci/Gates vaccine is the Mark of the Beast isn't going to fight you to the death if they believe the vaccine will alter their DNA and send them to eternal Hell??  You're insane .  You'll have dead and maimed vaccine-police all over the place.  It will be the most dangerous job in human history.  If people believe you're trying to force them to do something that will damn them to hell, what have they got lose???  Your vaccine-police will end up getting slaughtered like pigs.

Before the Trump administration took hold, a playbook was put in place, as to how to deal with a pandemic. Look at how the Obama administration dealt with H1N1 versus how the Trump administration is dealing with COVID-19, it went to show that the Obama administration tackled the crisis from the onset. Obama didn’t say to every U.S. Governor it’s only up to them to figure it out. Trump decided to concede responsibility for the pandemic, and the results are disturbing and evident. “I take no responsibility.” This pandemic has shown what taking no responsibility results in.   \n",

All. We have to be in this together, thats my overall belief, goal, truth, whatever. But Come on, this can't nothing more than comedy. Health care, global warming, etc, are very complex problems that debates won't fix. This is a joke to me, excuse my ignorance.

Biden will clearly bring back Obamacare, destroy oil and gas job. Clean energy means heavy taxation on everyone. Biden never explains how he will pay for his plans. Biden will certainly shut down or slow down the recovery. He also has no clear plan for Covid. He will most likely delay the vaccines considerably.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLikeComment\\n\\nShare   \n",

The total number of COVID deaths reported worldwide is 1,142,642 and the total number of COVID cases reported worldwide is 41,974,001. Within the twenty-four hour period of yesterday, totals of 973 new deaths and 74,301 new cases were reported in the United States. The previous day, totals of 1,224 new deaths and 64,067 new cases were reported. All the accumulative totals are increasing every day and are very likely to be underestimated. COVID-19 is a genuine pandemic and is taken seriously by the medical community all over the world. Please stay safe. Wear a mask, keep your distance and wash your hands regularly.

Just ignore the troublemaker and avoid trouble.  it's always better not to respond to evil, cowardly person and just walk away, thanking my Nakesake for the right He gave me not to be told how to breathe   \n",

Masks do not protect anyone from anything but they DO lower your own oxygen intake and cause you brain damage over time.  The only mask you could wear that would stop the virus is one made of Saran Wrap.  If air gets through, so does the virus.  PLEASE wake up about masks!!   \n",

A vast majority of the nation still relies on coal.  Their co2 emissions have risen 200% since 2000 and on the rise, while ours are down 10%.  Don’t get me wrong, renewable energy isn’t horrible, but China is by no means ahead of the United States in terms of going green.   \n",

I honestly don't think we will act on time, and even if we do,  transitioning is not free and it will cost a lot of money given how important oil and other efficient sources of energy are. Power and being the world leader will be prioritized instead of doing the right thing unfortunately. Although I wouldn't want a country like China to capitalize on other countries making a big step toward sustainable energy, they also have 1/3 of the world population. I don't support the Paris accord either, but just want us to do what's right for the sake of the world. We can't continue to grow when the planet isn't getting bigger. We need regulation because the private sector may take too long to respond. When thing aren't costing you directly or you are sharing the cost, you will only act when shtf   \n",

I’m all for renewables. Just the US being in the Paris accord will not change the ways of China. They could care less. Talk is cheap, but the leftists in this country would cripple our economy. It will be a slow transition to electric vehicles. Let the private section and the public make the  choices. Not the iron fist of the government. The government doesn’t know how to do anything, but spend other people’s money.   \n",

Besides your country is VERY small compared to the USA.   \n",

Your electric cars, use \"renewable resources\" and also require Lithium, cobalt, copper, and neodymium. All of which must be mined.   \n",

It's mainly from Japan, who innovates on high efficiency, low emission (HELE). I wouldnt say i agree since it contributes to the lock-in of carbon energy technologies, but it does contribute to overal lower greenhouse gas emission in the current coal based power regime. Just typical China, trying to innovate their way out of it.   \n",

It is a transition, and if you can't lead the way, you can't call yourself the leader of the world. What happens when your children and grandchildren are getting close to the last barrel of oil and you elected people who make us so dependent on it. Oil prices will skyrocket, jobs will be lost and people will die like flies when the economy cannot be sustained. Oil is the most efficient right now, but if we don' t work in finding alternatives, it could be the end of civilization.   \n",
