I finally thought that a Ted speech on climate change would give me an understanding about climate change. but all I got out of it is a woman with a sales pitch explaining how she came about creating her sales plan for climate change. After watching the video I still don't understand climate change. I don't know how and becomes a problem of completion with only two Nations out of 190 that are not in it is a problem. Why can't 188 Nations do it without the other two Nations. why does it take two more Nations to get this this rolling. It seems to be that it's not about how many nations join the climate Accord. It seems to me that this whole idea needs an investor and someone to be the sucker and implement the money for the whole project. As I try to learn more about this it seems to me like a pyramid scam where they take from one rich country and give to one poor country. Well Joe Biden is president now and he will sign the Paris Accord so I guess it will start rolling I just wonder how much more money America will borrow from European bankers to make this happen and at the end the American taxpayers will foot the bill. This is what America gets for bailing out Europe and sacrificing all the young men soldiers that died for Europe when the Nazis were going to take it all. This is how the Europeans repay us with a worldwide pyramid scam that will bankrupt America.</td>\n",

It's still personal choices of people whether they fly 10 times per year or don't want any green plant or tree in their garden. Can't force global population to pay for that. They say it's for investments in Bangladesh etc, but they have problems with water management, and lack of leadership in this, not just with climate. If you really believe that our actions increase temperature, we should live more simple, substract things, not add things. No money is needed for that. And why spend billions if of a lot of people don't even have their basic needs met? Which more has to do with power, powerlessness, oppurtunities, right investments at the right places etc. There should be investments made in projects that help women in third world countries out of their powerlessness, so they will give birth to the amount of children which their community can actually support, etc. The power of money only works if it's spend with a purpose and with integrity.

Thus, it will enhance the greening of the earth.  (Don't these folks want a \"green new deal\"?)  But climate change alarmists call it \"pollution\".  Complete and utter disconnect from reality, if they can't admit an obvious positive.  They call it \"global warming\" for about 20 years, then change the name to a term that describes what  has occurred naturally since the beginning of earth and before man existed \"climate change\", even though \"warming\" is entirely their meaning.

Before Paris, as she said, even if some governments sat together to try to understand how can they work together on fighting climate-related issues, the most \"dangerous\" ones didn't even care about participating on those talks as they were too worried on continuing their economic growth which is obviously connected to the environmental issues (countries like the BRIC). Although for some it's \"just politics\", please try to understand that first of all, having almost all the governments sitting, trying to find a solution, or before that, the reason for the climate change based on scientific facts it's a big step, so please be sensible.</td>\n",

All those countries who are in the Paris Climate Accord did not want to be members because they would have to pay the carbon tax in the form of carbon credits. So PCA decided to have the US join and give over $10 billion to the PCA which will be used to pay off those countries who didn't want to be members. They will distribute that money to the corrupted government and pay them to become PCA members. This includes China and India who are the biggest polluters. In fact, China and India were allowed to increase their carbon output. At the moment, Carbon  credits are being traded as commodities. Countries can buy carbon credits and will do not do anything to improve the environment. By 2030, PCA and IPCC (International Panel of Climate Change) are able to cash in their carbon credit which represents trillions of dollars. People who will benefit from this are the commodities brokers, corporations, George Soros,  The Clintons, The Bush's, and Al Gore.</td>\n",

Every major nation was ready to sign a binding agreement on their country's commitment to carbon reduction over a clearly stated time. the united states threw a tantrum and blew the whole thing off claiming that a promise ought to be sufficient. But then we would only promise something that essentially added up to nothing,  and at that point the ehole thing virtually disintegrated due to the disunity sown by our country. wonder why?\\ndoes the word PETRO DOLLAR mean anything to anyone who actually benefits from it? from there echoes an old idea we Americans used to see as having real significance in the business/political landscape, and that idea was commonly referred to as \"conflict of interests.\" our government is two-faced. it claims to want to lead the world on climate action, yet in reality blocks any movement in that direction, both at home and abroad because our entire economic well being depends on the petro industry expanding until there is no more oil, and then, as obama says, the united states will move into a carbon reduced future. thats what he really means.</td>\n",

The US military listened to the scientists who said, we must first meet with the engineers to ascertain the feasibility of these options. The engineer's foresight enabled them to advise which of the options were utterly impossible and which might possibly work out.

It's much less than what is needed. In Canada alone, even with the new Left-wing government, it's less than what what signed before. Look up the facts from NASA, ESA, the Chinese space agency, and many other agencies around the world that have the ability to look at the planet from a global scale. They all say that it is too late to stop the train that is climate change. If you look at Australia for example. They have shutdown the monitoring stations, stating that the money is better spent somewhere else! Australia is the number one government that monitors the south pole. They have elected a right-wing government that says F it! People are going for have to move, and therefore we should just make the best well we are here!Why give up I ask you? Why? Do you not want to have children? Do you want them fighting over fresh water, and land? Some people say let's try and find another planet. Let's try and move into the stars. Why? Why, when this is the best place we have, and we can try and save it. Yes there's going to be a global mass extinction. Yes we won't be able to feed humanity, or the majority of life here, but we can bring it back after many have died. It's time for mass global civil Disobedience! It's time to take back our planet from the billionaire businessman that are killing us all. Communism is horrible, and so is extreme capitalism! We must, we need to bring balance between the left and the right! Too much of the scale pushing either way is detrimental the planet! We must find the balance! We must fight for a balanced society! One where we don't throw everything away, and one where we throw things away to find a better way! We must be progressive, yet be sustainable for our own families! Only you can do it! Only you can get up and teach yourself, and your children that we must not waste, and we must throw away the things that are bad for our planet. Contact the local government, and tell them that you are a swing voter, and you will only vote for them if they care about sustainable development, and sustainable business! We must fight, and the time is now, or the future is war for resources. We all know this. Droughts all over Australia, the middle east, Europe, Asia, and the Americas. Please for me, for my children, for you, and your family! The time is now. Join 350.org, or the keep it in the ground campaign, or the many others! The time is now! Just making one phone call to your local government will make a major difference!</td>\n",

The quality of life for many people is going to drastically improve.  \\n\\nHonestly though the people who have the audacity to shrug off climate change, or unbelievably regurgitate half-baked negative rhetoric and slander without making even a bare minimal effort to look into climate change and forming their _own_ opinions, while literally millions are starving, dying from extreme natural disasters, and pollution and then use this as an excuse to dismiss/not worrying about climate change is the _epitome_ of hypocritical. \\n\\nREGARDLESS of whether you believe in climate change, renewable resources and lifestyles give people self-sufficiency and a degree of independence and security from the government and these corporations. Particularly in Australia for many living in remote communities we NEED renewable resources, not only so people can more easily access food, power and water, but so they don't choke under the extreme costs for access to these basic needs (which, hey, are only going to increase when these resources become more scarce). Renewable resources REDUCE the cost and IMPROVE living while giving people their own platform to stand on and have an actual say about their future.</td>\n",

Perhaps a future little ice age like the 1600's is seen as beneficial? Our climate has large swings of natural variability and I find it laughable to suggest we can manipulate it up and down via a few percentage points of atmospheric CO2 considering we are nowhere near on track for the catastrophic warming predicted 20 years ago and that data shows the climate is much less sensitive than claimed.</td>\n",

It also must give a theory for why pumping 10 billion tonnes of carbon into the air every year has no effect, because we've known since the 19th century that CO2 traps heat in the atmosphere.﻿</td>\n",

The fact that they got China, Russia, India and the US to sign is actually pretty historic.   Now, as for what it does, or better yet, what it forces everyone to do, is nothing.  That's right, there are no penalties for not abiding by this treaty.  To make it even less stellar is that it lets every country decide on their own what they plan to do to \"do their part\" of the treaty.  Now, china and india said they would close coal mines and other mineral mines that are toxic for the environment but both of them said they wouldn't do it for something like 10-15 years (your going to have to look it up, I don't remember the exact dates)  They funny part is that the treaty ends in 2030 and I believe one of these countries \"Plan\" doesn't start until after 2030...it was basically their way to participate in the treaty, get all the good karma without actually doing anything for the climate.  On the flip side, don't worry about the 100 Trillion dollar number they keep throwing around, that is future money that could have been made between now and 2030 if we didn't do what the treaty wants us to do (Again, each country decides what they will do, they aren't forced to do anything).  The Paris accords were important in atleast getting all those countries to sign a paper, but in reality, very little is actually done and most of it is for show.  I don't agree that the US pulled out but really, us being in or out has no impact on the climate cause we didn't actually have a plan , as part of the treaty, to reach the US lofty goal of 23% reduction in carbon emissions.....which will already happen due to getting off oil and moving to solar , wind and battery.</td>\n",

There are many secondary problems that come from having an exploding population, one which submits to a central authority that cannot cope with the increased bureaucratic demands. However, the population increase is not the problem itself, it is actually a good sign.\\n\\nChlorophyll production measured by satellites is actually increasing due to CO2. However, plant life and trees are dying in certain locales due to acidic rain caused by an output of SO2 and many other toxic wastes output by industry. Waters are polluted by chemical run-off and this affects our food chain directly. This is what needs to be addressed, not the increase in CO2. This is yet another fallacy that people buy into when thinking that the planet is dying - they focus on the CO2 and forget about the rest of the problems, hoping that somehow industry will be shut down by Carbon taxation and all the rest of the problems will cease. It doesn't happen like that. We need energy and resources to maintain our population, so attacking CO2 output will not solve any of the toxic waste issues we have.</td>\n",

Moreover, there's the political liability of not getting onboard. Participation does not correlate to universal interpretation of a theory's data. This issue at the international level will represent a precedent for global taxing authority. It represents one of the final steps for supporters of globalism to place one universal will over sovereign nations. Good speaker. I'd love to see other hypothesis posited for the current global climate/weather/earth changes. It seems like that is now happening due to weakness in the global warming hypothesis and discovery of purposeful aligning of data with political global initiatives for profit and power. Alas, any other theories will be too late. Our taxes will be raised based on the idea of our carbon output and given to the UN. Interesting time to be alive.</td>\n",

None of such has occured ever since Algore became VP. You say the topics i bring up are easily debunked? The Medieval Warm periods itself is a heavily debated topic and you want to use that against me. There are scientist that say it is a global phenomenal. \\n\\nEvery climatologist and Atmospheric Scientist knows that Water Vapour feedbacks are the main causes of increases in temperatures. Even the Scientific supporters of Man-Made Global Warming will tell you that. You clearly have not done your research. That water vapor feedback is the main part of the issue and where maybe, a debate should occur. Supporters say the feedback is 3 times. when skeptics say it is maybe less than 1 time as shown in the past few decades. As if it was 3 times, the ice caps at the poles would have melted and the temperature patterns wouldnt have been so normal.\\n\\nThat is why even the IPCC cant predict future Climate patterns when they pretend they can as shown in the early 2000s predictions.\\n\\nWhy we dont have to rush things is simply because we do have time. Imposing a rushed Carbon Tax program into place would displace millions of people from their jobs and you can guess where that will go. Obama's Carbon Tax program is as such. look it up.</td>\n",

The people talking about man-made climate change aren't climatologist, they are public figures and media spokemen. I have many peers who are atmospheric Researchers and climatologist that don't agree with this notion that humans are the main cause of climate change. You can start by researching on Water vapour feedbacks, medieval warm periods, climate temperature patterns over the last century, IPCC climate predictions of 2002. I am not saying who is correct or who is wrong. What I am upset about is that anyone who questions man-made climate change is immediately ridiculed. Science and the pursuit for the truth is to Question. The best way to force the masses to not question is to make it seem that questioning itself is lame and stupid. That itself is anti-science.

Cut to the chase; the Paris Climate Accord is a fraud.  The US was the only country to commit to reducing carbon emissions.  All the other countries said they would in the future but now and in the ten years to come they could keep increasing carbon emissions and then they would only keep immission at their levels in ten year.     I'm sure that fool we know have in the white house doesn't even know what is in the Paris Climate Accord.   \n",

I finally thought that a Ted speech on climate change would give me an understanding about climate change. but all I got out of it is a woman with a sales pitch explaining how she came about creating her sales plan for climate change. After watching the video I still don't understand climate change. I don't know how and becomes a problem of completion with only two Nations out of 190 that are not in it is a problem. Why can't 188 Nations do it without the other two Nations. why does it take two more Nations to get this this rolling. It seems to be that it's not about how many nations join the climate Accord. It seems to me that this whole idea needs an investor and someone to be the sucker and implement the money for the whole project. As I try to learn more about this it seems to me like a pyramid scam where they take from one rich country and give to one poor country. Well Joe Biden is president now and he will sign the Paris Accord so I guess it will start rolling I just wonder how much more money America will borrow from European bankers to make this happen and at the end the American taxpayers will foot the bill. This is what America gets for bailing out Europe and sacrificing all the young men soldiers that died for Europe when the Nazis were going to take it all. This is how the Europeans repay us with a worldwide pyramid scam that will bankrupt America.   \n",

They're just in two entire different worlds. Rich people feel guilty for their life-style so EVERYBODY has to pay. The irony is that we think we can solve this with pumping money into this. Where is it going to end up? Meanwhile money is still an abstract thing and doesn't bring us any closer to nature. It's still personal choices of people whether they fly 10 times per year or don't want any green plant or tree in their garden. Can't force global population to pay for that. They say it's for investments in Bangladesh etc, but they have problems with water management, and lack of leadership in this, not just with climate. If you really believe that our actions increase temperature, we should live more simple, substract things, not add things. No money is needed for that. And why spend billions if of a lot of people don't even have their basic needs met? Which more has to do with power, powerlessness, oppurtunities, right investments at the right places etc. There should be investments made in projects that help women in third world countries out of their powerlessness, so they will give birth to the amount of children which their community can actually support, etc. The power of money only works if it's spend with a purpose and with integrity. Not just blindly pumping it around.   \n",

This lady has no plan and lists no benefits because she simply wants to stir emotions. The twenty year shelf life of solar panels, the end of life for batteries and the old wind mills require massive amounts of land fills. The manufacturing of panels, batteries and wind mills will pollute our air beyond belief.   \n",

She is doing a lot of talking but she's not saying anything of real relevance. What are the details of the Paris Agreement, how exactly does it improve the environment and the earth's always changing climate? And what were the estimated carbon emissions from flying all of these world con artists together in one place.   \n",

Please watch with a open mind. We can help the environment by starting in our own communities, our homes, work places and schools. If you want a better world, start first with making yourself and your home better. Then work on making your own neighborhood and community better.

How much lower is the temperature ? \\nI mean really,  we have nearly collapsed the World economies;  have we pushed back global climate doomsday a year? \\nIs it cooler ? How much lower is the carbon footprint ? What did we get for our sacrifice ? \\nIf nothing how much more do you radical , communists need us to do ?   \n",

People talk about climate change because they don't want to face the fact that what will destroy the world is WW III. The same countries that fight climate change make millions developing and selling weapons. They complain about airplanes but they use airplanes to go to the conferences to complain about airplanes. End poverty and diseases first. Climate change is something for rich Europeans who destroyed many places in the world and now want to \" save the planet\". Stupidity and love for money is what will destroy the planet, not climate change.   \n",

That was the goal of the Paris climate agreement? That's the inside story? So take money from the USA and give it to the rest of the world? A year later 194 showed up with their hands out and 1 Donald Trump said we changed our minds we are keeping our money from now on so go fix your own problems and quit using the climate as an excuse to take money from USA. Those leaders should use their own resources to fight climate change in their own country.   \n",

I thought my skepticism was a sadly tiny minority.  Let's start with \"195 governments agreed....\".  That alone should give you pause.  Then let's consider CO2 is PUMPED into greenhouse by professional growers.  On purpose!  Thus, it will enhance the greening of the earth.  (Don't these folks want a \"green new deal\"?)  But climate change alarmists call it \"pollution\".  Complete and utter disconnect from reality, if they can't admit an obvious positive.  They call it \"global warming\" for about 20 years, then change the name to a term that describes what  has occurred naturally since the beginning of earth and before man existed \"climate change\", even though \"warming\" is entirely their meaning.  Why do that?  Really, why?  One word... Propaganda.   \n",

I’m not a sheep, and I can see this for what it is. Another attempt to scare people into believing that the world is going to end unless you do what they say, or pay the penalty . \\nI’m very thankful that President Trump pulled the USA out of this train wreck. \\nThe USA is the best country in terms of clean air and reducing carbon emissions and we didn’t have to pay billions to the “ carbon police” through the Paris climate agreement. To get this done. \\nAnd BTW - CO2 is actually what makes plants greener and grow, which produces more oxygen, which is good for the planet, but they won’t tell you that. They have an agenda and our best interests-are not it. It’s all about power and money (for them).\\nGlobalism is what this is about. \\nI’m all for a greener and cleaner planet, but let’s be honest about it.   \n",

Though China and India are the bigger AGW problem, they are perceived less and less as such because they aren’t blatantly rejecting the Paris Climate Agreement (the U.S. withdrawal becomes final on November 4, 2020 / the day after the election — thus, making AGW a prime issue, which the Democrats will squander the political capital of by overplaying garish social issues).   \n",

It would provide freshwater, fish farming, it will be the world's personal radiator by sending freezing water to our polar Caps, help with transportation, energy and power, flooding, cleaning up the ocean, and much more. This may sound a bit crazy but if supposedly something came and hit earth causing the world to heat up and started to melt whatever ice there was causing world floods then we this time are that thing (The Human astroid) that will heat up this world causing our own death by water cause earth doesn't care if it has land, water, lava, no air, acid rain, or if it just blows up and becomes the next ring of astroids between Mars and the sun. So please help me build the solution Aqualoop thank you   \n",

Everyone involved in this is a complete and utter fraud. Obama the biggest fraud in history. The UN is the biggest conglomerate fraud in world history. It’s run by private enterprise that is a group called The Club of Rome. These people want you dead, because they think they are smarter than you, and they have been social engineering the world for many years. They financed Chinas one child policy (Ted Turner put 120 million into that project) they are running the world because all of our politicians are simply money grabbing pathetic wankers that would shoot their own mother for $20.

And more importantly what about those Leaders who are dictated by GREED that don't attend?\\nWhy dont they attend? Do they know why they don't? when the days news headlines with deaths, or some terrorists act, which media companies are allowing negative news that suports violence or terrorism to take precedence? \\n\\n\\n\\nThink about.. Who will lose the most if Climate changes are addressed thus steering the world to even more profitable greener energy driven economy. \\n\\nWhere do you think terrorists get their funds from? You really don't have to look very far as to what the main industry is involved, and guess what? And who or what Nations do you think are heavily invested in those corporations funding Terrorists?\\n\\n\\n\\nLet's forever remember all those who attend climate change conferences as hero's, but more importantly lets forever remember those TRAITORS!! and terrorists supporters who didnt, Shun them and all their families, don't allow the world to be Trumped..   \n",

She is saying that the environmental diplomacy has taken huge steps in the last years. Before Paris, as she said, even if some governments sat together to try to understand how can they work together on fighting climate-related issues, the most \"dangerous\" ones didn't even care about participating on those talks as they were too worried on continuing their economic growth which is obviously connected to the environmental issues (countries like the BRIC). Although for some it's \"just politics\", please try to understand that first of all, having almost all the governments sitting, trying to find a solution, or before that, the reason for the climate change based on scientific facts it's a big step, so please be sensible.   \n",

The arguments are the same on both sides. \\n“The education-welfare establishment dreams of a Kyoto world where there is a shortage of everything and bureaucrats make the choices.\\nBureaucrats say global warming exists and can only be cured by bureaucrats taking over the world economy. What do you EXPECT them to say?\\nWheel cart and a donkey to peddle his organic bananas?\\nShame Trump stopped Paris 2015 and global warming. But CO2 is still going up and up, so there is hope we can get a bit warmer, since CO2 works some strange ways: Makes warm weather hotter, but cold weather gets colder. IPCC is sorry Paris 2015 got left behind.   \n",

CO2 content is 0.038%.\\nAlso , co2 is the chief component of photo synthesis.\\nWhy is everyone programmed to believe in climate change. \\nNotice how quick the agenda shifted from global warming to climate change?   \n",

Just because people showed up does not mean they will ratify and commit. It is a bit silly to get excited about people coming together when it's always easier said then done. Now let us see if something will get done. So far the US and Canada are not doing very much - not a good start.   \n",

Lol daring to believe the truth!

That includes China (the biggest pulluter yet they have a bigger GDP).  That deal would bankrupt America. At best if every country followed the accords, we would change the climate by 1degree in 100 years.  To really change the climate everyone would have to live like the almish. Bye bye Facebook (.

Humanity needs to see the world as it is and it is dying.  Decreasing (or even stopping) GHGE's won't prevent catastrophic, runaway Arctic warming.  Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) is the crucial first step to stop this train wreck.  The last time humanity had an intelligent breakthrough in CDR was over 1,000 years ago with terra preta.  Current CDR tools would utterly fail against the ravages of an ice-free Arctic Ocean.  If half of the world's super-computers were focused on CDR, it may deliver an innovative, original breakthrough to keep complex life on this planet alive.   \n",

Individually make a major contribution to combatting global warming. Go Green Between 13C/55F and 30C/85F - don't heat if your interior space is warmer than 13C/55F, and don't cool if your interior space is cooler than 30C/85F. It's easy. Go about your life as normal, just dress warmer, dress cooler, or dress in layers as conditions warrant. It's what much of the world has been doing all along. We are long past due for the rest of the world to do its part. Go GreenBetween!   \n",

Why not, if I'm a 3rd world country, the Agreement also says the rich countries will compensate me of disasters like floods, earth quakes, tornadoes, etc.\\nSo the Paris Agreement can boast 195 countries signed up!!!\\n\\nWhat is more silly, the Paris agreement says to limit the rise to no more than  \" 2° C above what is called pre-industrial levels\". Who knows what is global average temperature during the \"pre-industrial\" era?? There was no satellite temperature measurement!\\n\\nGo to   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uefn7ikVnVc&t=3s   \n",

As http://accorddeparis.org explains \"All life including humans may be extinct in under a decade, perhaps just 2-5 years.\" and there are steps at the site which explain how mayors in every city on earth might try to dodge the extinction bullet; thanks in no small measure to you, though sadly the \"We're still in\" movement is a bit too slow.   \n",

Paris Climate Accord is a scam that will pay off in trillions of dollars. All those countries who are in the Paris Climate Accord did not want to be members because they would have to pay the carbon tax in the form of carbon credits. So PCA decided to have the US join and give over $10 billion to the PCA which will be used to pay off those countries who didn't want to be members. They will distribute that money to the corrupted government and pay them to become PCA members. This includes China and India who are the biggest polluters. In fact, China and India were allowed to increase their carbon output. At the moment, Carbon  credits are being traded as commodities. Countries can buy carbon credits and will do not do anything to improve the environment. By 2030, PCA and IPCC (International Panel of Climate Change) are able to cash in their carbon credit which represents trillions of dollars. People who will benefit from this are the commodities brokers, corporations, George Soros,  The Clintons, The Bush's, and Al Gore.   \n",

This is based on a global government with no borders, under 1 government under the UN, a police state based on ancient Roman fascism.That is the sickness she is not talking about, millions beginning to die in the next holy war.   \n",

Every major nation was ready to sign a binding agreement on their country's commitment to carbon reduction over a clearly stated time. the united states threw a tantrum and blew the whole thing off claiming that a promise ought to be sufficient. But then we would only promise something that essentially added up to nothing,  and at that point the ehole thing virtually disintegrated due to the disunity sown by our country. wonder why?\\ndoes the word PETRO DOLLAR mean anything to anyone who actually benefits from it? from there echoes an old idea we Americans used to see as having real significance in the business/political landscape, and that idea was commonly referred to as \"conflict of interests.\" our government is two-faced. it claims to want to lead the world on climate action, yet in reality blocks any movement in that direction, both at home and abroad because our entire economic well being depends on the petro industry expanding until there is no more oil, and then, as obama says, the united states will move into a carbon reduced future. thats what he really means.   \n",

An effort to merge all nations to one world order through the control of people and the world's resources.  Think about what is most valuable to ALL....yes, it is the world.  It doesn't belong to just ONE, it belongs to us all, BUT this consolidation effort is putting what is all of ours into the hands of the new KINGS and their QUEENS.

Yes, there is global warming, but the Paris Agreement is making things worse for the planet while appeasing the BigOil companies & large corporations who are polluting.  Carbon Tax Credits, Solar Radiation Management, and Climate Geoengineering weren't mentioned.   Economic advantages and intrinsic benefits?  For whom?  Not for the poorest countries who are literally being \"dumped\" on by the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), who will suffer while the technological countries will reap huge benefits.

We won't be able to double CO2 in the atmosphere even if we tried super-hard. This is the most over-hyped non-issue ever created by globalist fearmongers ever. Amazing how the climate alarmists have managed to get away with it.   \n",

Useless because agreements are pointless, bureaucrats jetsetting doesn't do anything. The end goal of \"1.5C\" and \"2C\" is fraudulently based on models that vastly overstate the warming. So much so that we could do nothing on climate for the next 50 years and we still would only warm by another .5C. How can I be confident with such a prediction? Because that is what has happened for the last 70 years already. About 0.1C of warming per decade. And the warming has actually slowed down in the last 20 years, on par with the science that says CO2's impact is based on the log of the concentration of CO2. Note carefully, not much science in her talk.   \n",

Scientists may strive to achieve the impossible, but none of their ideas, good or half baked ever make it to the finish line within considerable time and effort put in by the engineers who strive to take it from concept to field-proven reality. \\n\\nA prime example was the US development of the first atomic bomb...... The US military listened to the scientists who said, we must first meet with the engineers to ascertain the feasibility of these options. The engineer's foresight enabled them to advise which of the options were utterly impossible and which might possibly work out. The decision was made to accept the engineer's advice and the projects succeeded.....\\n\\nSuch was not the case in Germany nor in Japan...... the government refused to listen to the engineers. We need to make political stupidity a criminal offense and prosecute these fool with the death penalty for all the suffering and death that will otherwise occur to the masses.   \n",

       "283  There is no legally binding contract, and the government's of the world have reduced their goals from the Kyoto Accord. Yes, they have signed, but it's nowhere near enough. It's much less than what is needed. In Canada alone, even with the new Left-wing government, it's less than what what signed before. Look up the facts from NASA, ESA, the Chinese space agency, and many other agencies around the world that have the ability to look at the planet from a global scale. They all say that it is too late to stop the train that is climate change. If you look at Australia for example. They have shutdown the monitoring stations, stating that the money is better spent somewhere else! Australia is the number one government that monitors the south pole. They have elected a right-wing government that says F it! People are going for have to move, and therefore we should just make the best well we are here!Why give up I ask you? Why? Do you not want to have children? Do you want them fighting over fresh water, and land? Some people say let's try and find another planet. Let's try and move into the stars. Why? Why, when this is the best place we have, and we can try and save it. Yes there's going to be a global mass extinction. Yes we won't be able to feed humanity, or the majority of life here, but we can bring it back after many have died. It's time for mass global civil Disobedience! It's time to take back our planet from the billionaire businessman that are killing us all. Communism is horrible, and so is extreme capitalism! We must, we need to bring balance between the left and the right! Too much of the scale pushing either way is detrimental the planet! We must find the balance! We must fight for a balanced society! One where we don't throw everything away, and one where we throw things away to find a better way! We must be progressive, yet be sustainable for our own families! Only you can do it! Only you can get up and teach yourself, and your children that we must not waste, and we must throw away the things that are bad for our planet. Contact the local government, and tell them that you are a swing voter, and you will only vote for them if they care about sustainable development, and sustainable business! We must fight, and the time is now, or the future is war for resources. We all know this. Droughts all over Australia, the middle east, Europe, Asia, and the Americas.

There is a huge lesson for the human race here and it is becoming more apparent daily.There is no way to quick fix a flawed system - our skewed system of constant growth or so called progress..there is no such thing.All we have done as a species is create technologies that have alienated us from the bedrock of our environmental source and that have put us on a disastrous path to our own destruction and extinction.The global and 'concerned' governments(note that none of them are mentioned by her)are simply giving lip service in order to continue doing what they have always done..make more profits for their shareholders and benefactors(the invisible 1% that hold more than 50% of the global economic wealth)and at the same time line their own pockets through those corrupt connections.   \n",

Job done, pat yourself on the back. \\n\\nThe Paris agreement is a sick joke. A goal of limiting warming to 1.5 C, now already passed even before the agreement is ratified. A firm commitment to 2.0 C, but with measures that will deliver 4-12 C. \\n\\nWith global dimming taken into account we're *already* over 3 C above pre-industrial. \\n\\nMeanwhile even these so called 'legally binding' agreements are being completely ignored. Australia has just granted licences for vast new coal mines. Canada is still subsidising oil sand extraction even though it's well below profitable in terms of money and nearly below profitable in terms of energy.   \n",

This seems to be happening a lot with TED talks lately. Bland, wishy-washy talks which are largely devoid of any interesting and/or challenging information. Packed full of clichés (\"we must do this together\", \"real progress requires change\", \"we have to think outside the box\" etc etc), but not really giving us any real information.\\n\\nI miss the old TED talks which used to be much more data based, with facts, figures, demonstrations etc. Occasionally I still see them, but too much people talking for a long time about not much.   \n",

Most of the countries did not really agree to make real change. Only the US actually agreed to reduce emissions by roughly 25%. Go read what some of the other countries agreed to. No different than they were already trying to get to. Useless.   \n",

We'll be taught in schools to love the new order that has risen and demand more and more progress as the world progressively falls deeper into barbarism.   \n",

So how can you say you want to change the global warming path we've been taking, when your carbon footprint is off the charts? \\nShe mentiones new technologies regarding clean energy, but what about this not so new technology called conference calling? I know its not as fancy as all getting together in beautiful Paris to discuss the problem, to later go on cocktails to drink champagne and pat each other on the back for having signed an agreement, but global warming is not fancy. A more humble approach is probably the way to go.   \n",

I have been following the Climate talks for a while and it's nice to get an insider's perspective (with an informed opinion) on the matter. Seeing some huge steps forward from many countries around the world, like Peru giving solar power to 2 million of it's poorest citizens! The quality of life for many people is going to drastically improve.  \\n\\nHonestly though the people who have the audacity to shrug off climate change, or unbelievably regurgitate half-baked negative rhetoric and slander without making even a bare minimal effort to look into climate change and forming their _own_ opinions, while literally millions are starving, dying from extreme natural disasters, and pollution and then use this as an excuse to dismiss/not worrying about climate change is the _epitome_ of hypocritical. \\n\\nREGARDLESS of whether you believe in climate change, renewable resources and lifestyles give people self-sufficiency and a degree of independence and security from the government and these corporations. Particularly in Australia for many living in remote communities we NEED renewable resources, not only so people can more easily access food, power and water, but so they don't choke under the extreme costs for access to these basic needs (which, hey, are only going to increase when these resources become more scarce). Renewable resources REDUCE the cost and IMPROVE living while giving people their own platform to stand on and have an actual say about their future.   \n",

Perhaps a future little ice age like the 1600's is seen as beneficial? Our climate has large swings of natural variability and I find it laughable to suggest we can manipulate it up and down via a few percentage points of atmospheric CO2 considering we are nowhere near on track for the catastrophic warming predicted 20 years ago and that data shows the climate is much less sensitive than claimed.   \n",

I also made an argument: if every year, we are putting twice as much CO2 into atmosphere as can be absorbed, then one would expect there to be consequences. An argument against man-made climate change doesn't just have to give an alternative theory as to why the earth is heating up. It also must give a theory for why pumping 10 billion tonnes of carbon into the air every year has no effect, because we've known since the 19th century that CO2 traps heat in the atmosphere.﻿   \n",

The scientific literature is conclusive and consistent that global warming is happening. You just happen to disagree with that conclusion.

In 2005, ELEVEN national academies made a joint declaration that not only is global warming happening, but that we need to do something about it.

You tell me, a majority of nations have vowed to never use land mines or chemical weapons, has the use of them increased or decreased? Or are you implying that you consider lgbt and abortions to be equally bad to wanting to prevent coastal regions from disaster? Look up the percentage of people that live in coastal regions that would be effected.

It's pretty gross. And it's only one part of a much greater picture.   \n",

And for all the skeptics, it's great to be critical to fix flaws in this agreement, but just assume for a minute that you could be wrong, just assume that the ice caps melting raising sea levels, weather patterns changing, green energy a possible solution (and unless you're psychic you can't assume that neither side is right/wrong), but just imagine that the vast majority of the scientific community is actually right on this, but we go down you're road and do nothing. What is the price to pay then?   \n",

The fact that they got China, Russia, India and the US to sign is actually pretty historic.   Now, as for what it does, or better yet, what it forces everyone to do, is nothing.  That's right, there are no penalties for not abiding by this treaty.  To make it even less stellar is that it lets every country decide on their own what they plan to do to \"do their part\" of the treaty.  Now, china and india said they would close coal mines and other mineral mines that are toxic for the environment but both of them said they wouldn't do it for something like 10-15 years (your going to have to look it up, I don't remember the exact dates)  They funny part is that the treaty ends in 2030 and I believe one of these countries \"Plan\" doesn't start until after 2030...it was basically their way to participate in the treaty, get all the good karma without actually doing anything for the climate.  On the flip side, don't worry about the 100 Trillion dollar number they keep throwing around, that is future money that could have been made between now and 2030 if we didn't do what the treaty wants us to do (Again, each country decides what they will do, they aren't forced to do anything).  The Paris accords were important in atleast getting all those countries to sign a paper, but in reality, very little is actually done and most of it is for show.  I don't agree that the US pulled out but really, us being in or out has no impact on the climate cause we didn't actually have a plan , as part of the treaty, to reach the US lofty goal of 23% reduction in carbon emissions.....which will already happen due to getting off oil and moving to solar , wind and battery.   \n",

The main objective is to generate clout for the politicians, such as the speaker in this video. It is about appearing to be doing great things, by spellbinding people with stories that make them feel things. If they are lucky, they get a lot of money and/or power (same thing) for talking more, in the future. Hillary Clinton and Obama are good examples of coat turning career politicians as well, for example. Trump is the more honest fascist, like Mr Hitler himself, basing his politics on agressive bullshit, which feeds the rage of the masses, as a simple shortcut to power.   \n",

It's quite a dis-ease. But being positive with a weak basis is also fraught with difficulty as well — imagine how bad it would feel to find out it's all a lie. Don't get me wrong — I'm not saying it's all a lie. We really did come to an agreement in Copenhagen. I know there are certain things being done to improve the climate, but every time she said lots and lots of great things were being done, I was disappointed (as a rather uninformed individual) to hear her not give specific examples to back up her incredibly positive claims.   \n",

It doesn't stagnate on civil rights, and it has almost 0 greenhouse gas emissions.  Geothermal energy is 400 percent efficient. Geothermal power plants have average availabilities of 90% or higher, compared to about 75% for coal plants. And its a renewable resource and homegrown lessening the US dependency of foreign oil.   \n",

Believe it possible, firstly. Never give up hope, secondly. Work towards securing our collective interests of self preservation, thirdly. Aim to cooperate with your neighbors whenever they wish to do something which will benefit everyone, fourthly. Make every possible diplomatic gesture to people who refuse to believe they can change the world, fifthly. And lastly, never, ever resign yourself over to failure.\\n\\nWe CAN make a difference, if we believe we can do it together!\\n\\nThank you   \n",

The overuse of parallel structure, in such an explicit manner, makes it all seem rather trite; particularly when many of the suggestions are practically synonymous, if not already having a considerable amount of overlap.   \n",

You should read first before commenting.\\nClimate Change is real, even if it's not anthropogenic. And people still dislike even if a video is just about climate change in general. This shows how aware those people actually are about the issue.   \n",

Did you even know that most of the time SO2 is released with CO2. So controlling CO2 will automatically control SO2 and NO3. And you are the only one that thinks people only focus on CO2. Acid rain is as much concern as global warming.   \n",

There are many secondary problems that come from having an exploding population, one which submits to a central authority that cannot cope with the increased bureaucratic demands. However, the population increase is not the problem itself, it is actually a good sign.\\n\\nChlorophyll production measured by satellites is actually increasing due to CO2. However, plant life and trees are dying in certain locales due to acidic rain caused by an output of SO2 and many other toxic wastes output by industry. Waters are polluted by chemical run-off and this affects our food chain directly. This is what needs to be addressed, not the increase in CO2. This is yet another fallacy that people buy into when thinking that the planet is dying - they focus on the CO2 and forget about the rest of the problems, hoping that somehow industry will be shut down by Carbon taxation and all the rest of the problems will cease. It doesn't happen like that. We need energy and resources to maintain our population, so attacking CO2 output will not solve any of the toxic waste issues we have.   \n",

Believe it possible, firstly. Never give up hope, secondly. Work towards securing our collective interests of self preservation, thirdly. Aim to cooperate with your neighbors whenever they wish to do something which will benefit everyone, fourthly. Make every possible diplomatic gesture to people who refuse to believe they can change the world, fifthly. And lastly, never, ever resign yourself over to failure.\\nWe CAN make a difference, if we believe we can do it together!   \n",

Humans are not doing great, you need merely look towards overpopulation in India, China, and many parts of Africa. Even parts of the Western world are struggling with overpopulation. Plant life around the world is collapsing because of human exploitation. You need only look at the forest cover of the Amazon rainforest through the past century.\\n\\nIronic how your movement against bullshit smells worse.   \n",

It's a movement against bullshit. \"Anthropogenic Climate Change\" is one flavour of it. It is an authoritatian political movement that's aiming towards controlling every single human on the planet through treaties, laws and corporate policies. It has absolutely nothing to do with saving the planet (or even saving the human race). The human race is doing damn well on this planet due to burning fossil fuels and I'm thankful to be alive because of it. Plant life is doing very well due to the miniscule increase in concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere.   \n",

Except not. Because the oceans completely reabsorb all CO^2, unlike the tons of crap humans pump into the atmosphere.   \n",

Who's teaching you this stuff?\\n\\nDo you seriously think that anyone was waiting for the tobacco industry to tell them cigarettes were harmful? The medical community knew that in the 19th century. Why do you think they were called \"coffin nails\" during WW1? Why did Mark Twain write about the hazards of smoking?\\n\\n\"Lead Paint industry lobby\"? The toxicity of lead paint was know 1000 years ago. Was the supposed _lead paint industry lobby_ a medieval trade guild?\\n\\nSo that's why you think Big Oil propaganda is the cause of \"denial.\" No, data is the cause. And BTW, no one denies climate change. Only a minority of climate scientists are convinced it is primarily man made.\\n\\nFollow the data and it takes you to skepticism.\\n\\nFollow the money and it takes you to the green NGOs who take in billions (look it up) a year with their propaganda.   \n",

On one hand there's hypothetical funding for them. On the other hand - Agree to tax or be taxed/fined more. Moreover, there's the political liability of not getting onboard. Participation does not correlate to universal interpretation of a theory's data. This issue at the international level will represent a precedent for global taxing authority. It represents one of the final steps for supporters of globalism to place one universal will over sovereign nations. Good speaker. I'd love to see other hypothesis posited for the current global climate/weather/earth changes. It seems like that is now happening due to weakness in the global warming hypothesis and discovery of purposeful aligning of data with political global initiatives for profit and power. Alas, any other theories will be too late. Our taxes will be raised based on the idea of our carbon output and given to the UN. Interesting time to be alive.   \n",

Things that need to change are ideology about climate and the way we consume. Not \"legally binding\" contracts. those contracts allow the consumers to carry on living as they live today, just buying different products and allowing the companies to make their choices solely looking at their profits. \\n\\nThat jeweller who said the pearls would be extinct soon but \"they signed an accord\" is not optimism! OPTIMISM WOULD BE SAYING \"WE DO NOT NEED TO IMPORT EXTINCT SPECIES, which are excessively polluting to get here, taking away jobs from tahiti, and feeding the machine of materialism\"\\n\\nSomeone who understands the aims and how to fulfill them would know to stop wearing makeup and dying their hair. Regardless of their right to do so, it should be, as i said, part of their ideology.   \n",

India and china are cutting emissions encouraging solar power and conserving water... Which the governments themselves are encouraging with stipends and tax benefits... Plus india and china are not the major contributors in co2 emissions... Both the nations are agriculture based... If you are counting on number of people breathing in india and china as emissions and not the number of cars, industries and wastes generated you are still not making a point there. compared to the sparely populated rest of the world generating these two highly populated nations are doing better.   \n",

Respectfully, how much of your current quality of life would you give up for a better across the board international standard? I've thought about this myself. I can see some great things but I'm not sure it's worth the sovereignty that would have to be given up.  It seems the standards are never raised to the highest common denominator but reduced to the lowest. Warmest regards!   \n",

It takes a lot of work and ability to \"break through\" at all. This is what they (Greenpeace and other populist organizations, for profit)  avoid, but what we eat and the cost for any animal derived product on health and environment, are what we have to change to survive and maintain \"civilization\". Possibly it does come down to human extinction within 200 years, even.   \n",

I did not say they were completely inactive, then no money. Money is most important, then attention, fame, ... silly Watson didnt want to focus on sharing fame and fortune, focused on issues instead.

Better to gloss over the real problems and make money in the short term, for the involved. Thus, extinction becomes inevitable for human civilization.   \n",

Sea Shepherd is one of few organizations that speak truthfully, in my experience. Cowspiracy does a good job (free on Netflix) in showing what the issue is, with facts and attempted communication with the culprits.   \n",

They pick the easy targets to complain about (oil&gas industries, not so much meat, milk and egg production, for example), to facilitate maximum membership fees. They are politicians, not a group interested in protecting the environment.

For me it was a lively speech that lasted only 7:25 minutes. :) I recommend the Chrome plugin \"Video Speed Controller\" it adds speed control to all HTML5 players and gives you finer steps in speed. I think it is open source on gitHub so it probably does not do fishy things. :)   \n",

A lot of it is natural but we are 100% ADDING to it.. You cannot refute that, if you want to refute that you're just in denial.  all the deforestation - not doing any damage? Really   \n",

All those topics are being heavily debated in scientific literature.

I am saying a proper debate on facts and figures should happen. None of such has occured ever since Algore became VP. You say the topics i bring up are easily debunked? The Medieval Warm periods itself is a heavily debated topic and you want to use that against me. There are scientist that say it is a global phenomenal. \\n\\nEvery climatologist and Atmospheric Scientist knows that Water Vapour feedbacks are the main causes of increases in temperatures. Even the Scientific supporters of Man-Made Global Warming will tell you that. You clearly have not done your research. That water vapor feedback is the main part of the issue and where maybe, a debate should occur. Supporters say the feedback is 3 times. when skeptics say it is maybe less than 1 time as shown in the past few decades. As if it was 3 times, the ice caps at the poles would have melted and the temperature patterns wouldnt have been so normal.\\n\\nThat is why even the IPCC cant predict future Climate patterns when they pretend they can as shown in the early 2000s predictions.\\n\\nWhy we dont have to rush things is simply because we do have time. Imposing a rushed Carbon Tax program into place would displace millions of people from their jobs and you can guess where that will go. Obama's Carbon Tax program is as such. look it up.   \n",

Durring that time China was a frozen waste land. The current global warming is caused by the co2 in the air. exactly how the climate gets fucked up from global warming is the question we are debating.   \n",

There are quite a lot of information readily available on the Internet. Look at research papers and not media post. Those are biased. The people talking about man-made climate change aren't climatologist, they are public figures and media spokemen. I have many peers who are atmospheric Researchers and climatologist that don't agree with this notion that humans are the main cause of climate change. You can start by researching on Water vapour feedbacks, medieval warm periods, climate temperature patterns over the last century, IPCC climate predictions of 2002. I am not saying who is correct or who is wrong. What I am upset about is that anyone who questions man-made climate change is immediately ridiculed. Science and the pursuit for the truth is to Question. The best way to force the masses to not question is to make it seem that questioning itself is lame and stupid. That itself is anti-science. If you see anyone doing it, you know they are trying to influence you.   \n",

Solar panes and lithium bateries and still extremly expensive and inecological. Electric car has way bigger emitions than normal car does, it roughly eqals out after 5 years (wich is basicly time to get new batteries). Yes we have to move towards diferend source of energy but free market has been pretty good about it. Maybe fund reaserch of more effective and better technology, dont fund buying of them.
