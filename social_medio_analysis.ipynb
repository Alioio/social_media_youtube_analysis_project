The focus on coal, an energy source that is becoming uneconomical even in developing countries, and that employs very few people in America can't have anything to do with anything except an imagined fondness for a world that probably never existed. These people are right that fossil fuels have been great for Americans and also for the world. I think the people who worked and fought to use fossil fuels to make people's lives better did good things. I also think we need new paths and to retire old ones. 2. A push to have countries care only about their own interests. Climate change is the best example that this doesn't work. And that's very scary for people who are skeptical of globalism. It may seem to them awfully convenient that the people who want a more global society happened to find this disaster that can only be solved by a more global society. Of course there are some that are purely economically motivated, but while those people are powerful, there aren't many of them. But these are the things that really resonate with large numbers of people. And when you're trying to defend your worldview, you'll make some magnificent mental leaps to do it...like that every scientist ever is lying about how CO2 absorption works. There are a couple Twitter threads that I really enjoyed on these topics. here they are.

With the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, 197 countries agreed to set emission targets that would limit global temperature rise 1.5 degrees Celsius by capping greenhouse emissions at \"net-zero\" -- or absorbing as much carbon as they emit -- by 2050. So far, only two countries (Gambia and Morocco) are hitting their targets, while the biggest emitters are falling flat, or ignoring their goals entirely. How can we hold these countries accountable? Enter the Climate Action Tracker. This video was part of the Countdown Global Launch on 10.10.2020. (Watch the full event here: https://youtu.be/5dVcn8NjbwY.) Countdown is TED's global initiative to accelerate solutions to the climate crisis.

Here are some links that support my thinking: BC Carbon tax and impact: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia_carbon_tax Popular opinion about the Paris Climate Agreement: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/was-trumps-paris-exit-good-politics/ http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/paris_agreement_by_state/ India and China pledges: http://www.climatechangenews.com/2017/05/15/india-china-track-exceed-paris-climate-pledges/ Exxon Mobil support for Paris Agreement: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-31/exxon-conoco-back-paris-climate-deal-as-trump-weighs-pact-exit   \n",
       "26  At the heart of the desire to get America out of the Paris Agreement seems to be three things: 1. Nostalgia. The focus on coal, an energy source that is becoming uneconomical even in developing countries, and that employs very few people in America can't have anything to do with anything except an imagined fondness for a world that probably never existed. These people are right that fossil fuels have been great for Americans and also for the world. I think the people who worked and fought to use fossil fuels to make people's lives better did good things. I also think we need new paths and to retire old ones. 2. A push to have countries care only about their own interests. Climate change is the best example that this doesn't work. And that's very scary for people who are skeptical of globalism. It may seem to them awfully convenient that the people who want a more global society happened to find this disaster that can only be solved by a more global society. Of course there are some that are purely economically motivated, but while those people are powerful, there aren't many of them. But these are the things that really resonate with large numbers of people. And when you're trying to defend your worldview, you'll make some magnificent mental leaps to do it...like that every scientist ever is lying about how CO2 absorption works. There are a couple Twitter threads that I really enjoyed on these topics. here they are.

He said moves to negotiate a new deal that would not disadvantage the US would begin. Mr Trump said during last year's presidential election campaign that he would take the step to help his country's oil and coal industries. Opponents say withdrawing from the accord is an abdication of US leadership on a key global challenge.

With the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, 197 countries agreed to set emission targets that would limit global temperature rise 1.5 degrees Celsius by capping greenhouse emissions at \"net-zero\" -- or absorbing as much carbon as they emit -- by 2050. So far, only two countries (Gambia and Morocco) are hitting their targets, while the biggest emitters are falling flat, or ignoring their goals entirely. How can we hold these countries accountable? Enter the Climate Action Tracker. This video was part of the Countdown Global Launch on 10.10.2020. (Watch the full event here: https://youtu.be/5dVcn8NjbwY.) Countdown is TED's global initiative to accelerate solutions to the climate crisis. The goal: to build a better future by cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030, in the race to a zero-carbon world.
