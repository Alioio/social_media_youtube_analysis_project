Corporation is in the industry of manufacturing consent. Free merch &gt; Free speech. Corporate, what kind of _free_ manufactured merchandise must be in your goodie bag to consent investing into paradise? Corporations [through governments] are harvesting our biometric data on global scale. So they can get to know us far better than we know ourselves, and they not just predict our feelings but also manipulate our feelings and sell us anything they want- Be it a product as a service or politician. Have you heard of focus groups? Now with always online/big data collection... you are in the focus groups. Except you don't get paid for it. You get exploited and you pay to be part of it. _Nothing is free, except the energy from the sun, but some get a bill(skin cancer) for that. Thanks to always providing industrial surveillance corporatism._ We live in a pretend society.

Their approval was obtained through manufactured consent. Corporation is not the industry of manufacturing products. Corporation is in the industry of manufacturing consent. Free merch > Free speech. Corporate, what kind of _free_ manufactured merchandise must be in your goodie bag to consent investing into paradise? Corporations [through governments] are harvesting our biometric data on global scale. So they can get to know us far better than we know ourselves, and they not just predict our feelings but also manipulate our feelings and sell us anything they want- Be it a product as a service or politician. Have you heard of focus groups? Now with always online/big data collection... you are in the focus groups. Except you don't get paid for it. You get exploited and you pay to be part of it. _Nothing is free, except the energy from the sun, but some get a bill(skin cancer) for that. Thanks to always providing industrial surveillance corporatism._ We live in a pretend society.

There is no much sense if you trash your garbage on the street and where ever you are and not in recycle bin and than someone will collect that garbage all around . CO2 emissions 60% are from electricity production and heating systems during winter and 25% is cars. We can solve those 60% with measure that will collect CO2 on source where is produced. Collecting 10% CO2 mixture of gases that comes from every chimney of some electricity production power plant is much easier and more efficient that collecting from air (do not trash garbage on the street).\\nRest 25% emissions from cars should be moved to electric cars .\\nI'm too for capture from air but first things first.

Capturing on the source from chimney gases  that have 10% CO2  is much easier and more efficient than from air that have 0,04% CO2. You need energy to do so and at power plant is already available.

This is an inevitable evolution which comes about because, as the billions of years roll by, the Sun is burning up the hydrogen in its core. The helium \"ashes\" left behind are denser than hydrogen, so the hydrogen/helium mix in the Sun's core is very slowly becoming denser, thus raising the pressure.  This causes the nuclear reactions to run a little hotter.  The Sun brightens.</td>\n",

CO2 and water vapor blocks heat that is going from earth to space, so Earth can't coll down so fast that would otherwise be without them. Just like your body will be cold without your clothes. The thing is, Sun LIGHT can go in (all gasses pass light) BUT greenhouse gasses do not pass infrared radiation from warm earth surface back to space, so Earth stays warmer. CO2 and water vapor and also methane (CH4) and N2O are greenhouse gases that have different shape of molecule so they interact with infrared radiation. Nitrogen N2, Oxygen 02 and argon do NOT block infrared radiation. So no matter that N2 is 78% in air, it does nothing. You also know that small quantities of some matter can have impacts like medicine or poison to your body in very small percentages. Yes go to reliable sources, like NASA and Wikipedia or read IPCC report or find some top climate scientist on twitter that most importantly have lot of peer review papers and studies about climate. Google had employed some real climate scientists to show first pages that will be shown about climate change when you type it that are from reliable sources not from fake ones that I can see you are feed with. \"I am not talking of pocket of industrial area.\" There is not \"industrial pockets\", air mix very well with wind, CO2 fluctuation from place to place today are very small, but yes measurable, also CO2 fluctuate with seasons. In winter is higher and in Summer is smaller. But year to year CO2 is going up 2.5ppm every year because our emissions from burning coal, oil an gas. \"In fact there are points in our history where co2 was much higher than today and the planet was more inhabitable and cooler.\" Those periods of very high CO2 in air are 100s of millions of years in the past so SUN was less stronger. Did you know that last time this much CO2 was in air was 3millions years ago and see level was 16feet (5meters) higher?</td>\n",

Problem is when this start to decompose it will release very potent green effect methane gas. It have 32 times higher effect than CO2. We have there temp. dependent ticking bomb. Problem is that temp. there is rising much faster then on other places on Earth and you know difference between ice and no ice is small. You have on 30°F ice and on 34°F melted thing. This is why we should limit global temp. to 1,5- 2°C (3,6°F) and that's why this 12years. Because if we continue this pace in 12years we will have point with no return. When this thing start to emit that amount of methane earth will start to heat more, than it melts even more and you get even more gas. The reason why this area from north pole is heating so fast is less and less white snow in summer that reflect sun radiation back in space. So less snow more heating and also more methane gas and more water expansion from heated oceans. If we pass that 2°C, it is unstoppable ! Temp of earth will rise more than 5°C than, you have than Antarctic melting. All ice there is on land so sea level rise rate will be higher, then you have permafrost from there.. Then you have further expansion of ocean because heated water expand and then we can talk about significant sea level rise ..

Yes, this is OK but you I think that you will agree. There is no much sense if you trash your garbage on the street and where ever you are and not in recycle bin and than someone will collect that garbage all around . CO2 emissions 60% are from electricity production and heating systems during winter and 25% is cars. We can solve those 60% with measure that will collect CO2 on source where is produced. Collecting 10% CO2 mixture of gases that comes from every chimney of some electricity production power plant is much easier and more efficient that collecting from air (do not trash garbage on the street).\\nRest 25% emissions from cars should be moved to electric cars .\\nI'm too for capture from air but first things first. Please distinguish these two things capture on source and capture from air. \\n\\nThanks!   \n",

I have watched, It's nice :-) Carbon capture tech. from air have no sense if we continue to release CO2 from every chimney EL. power plant or heating plant. FIRST we have to install scrubbers on every that chimney and store collected CO2 underground. Capturing on the source from chimney gases  that have 10% CO2  is much easier and more efficient than from air that have 0,04% CO2. You need energy to do so and at power plant is already available. Solar and wind is the future.   \n",

Na youtube. Otiđi na neki provjereni sajt a ne gradit znanje na youtube o ovoj temi. Youtube je pun videa koji su lažni, posebno o klimi.\\nOtiđi na NASA climate, ili wikipedia global warming. Problem s ovim zatopljenjem je brzina kojom se događa. Brzina kojom se temp. diže tjekom izlaska iz ledenog doba je 9 puta sporija nego što je ovo zatopljenje.   \n",

That is my impression for climate science, e.g. that moon landing was hoax, that earth is flat etc.\\n\\nStay well 🙏   \n",

You can insulate your home to lose less energy and pay less for heating your home.\\nAll in all you can save lot of money and also help the planet.\\nAlso change all your light to LED they use 10times less energy than incandescent light bulb and they last much longer also saving you money on your electric bill.   \n",

These are two different things.\\n\\nFor climate you should measure average temp for every day in 1 year to measure climate. Than you compare that average year temp with average year temp of years before. Once you know what average year temp was from for example 1880 year and to today you know how climate is changing and how fast.\\nThis is data from 1880 but collected globally from lot of meteo stations in the world so it shows how global temp is changing what is more relevant.\\n\\nhttps://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/AC17MzVk14_kWjvB1nEJlYUPQUh8tlpVTL3idFGKqOsp3g2ygHRpf_Vw8NwLmakd4GtkEknFTMJUwDNzD9ZB5GUsOVnZkGxR1HTmCjWUTwvBSlOq1_NWmH4Pu8x10s9xQgA39cFVsg   \n",

In this study, which uses an insolation of 1700 kWh/m2/yr and a system lifetime of 30 years, mean harmonized EROIs between 8.7 and 34.2 were found. Mean harmonized energy payback time varied from 1.0 to 4.1 years.\"\\n\\nToday solar is 93% from silicon second abundant element on earth, it's non toxic.\\nYou have 5% from toxic cadmium telluride production but those you can't buy as individual and are used in space for satellites and no matter what they are all recyclable after 30 or more years of operation.\\n\\nAlso this !

Since its birth 4.5 billion years ago, the Sun's luminosity has very gently increased by about 30%. This is an inevitable evolution which comes about because, as the billions of years roll by, the Sun is burning up the hydrogen in its core. The helium \"ashes\" left behind are denser than hydrogen, so the hydrogen/helium mix in the Sun's core is very slowly becoming denser, thus raising the pressure.  This causes the nuclear reactions to run a little hotter.  The Sun brightens.   \n",

Stars in their life of billion of years start with lower power and increase it very slowly during billions of years. That type of increase of power is very slow but it's constant. So in the past you would need much more CO2 in air to have same temp. as it is today.   \n",
       "315423  @hoshang wadia \"it's about 0.04 %\" Yes, so what? CO2 and water vapor blocks heat that is going from earth to space, so Earth can't coll down so fast that would otherwise be without them. Just like your body will be cold without your clothes. The thing is, Sun LIGHT can go in (all gasses pass light) BUT greenhouse gasses do not pass infrared radiation from warm earth surface back to space, so Earth stays warmer. CO2 and water vapor and also methane (CH4) and N2O are greenhouse gases that have different shape of molecule so they interact with infrared radiation. Nitrogen N2, Oxygen 02 and argon do NOT block infrared radiation. So no matter that N2 is 78% in air, it does nothing. You also know that small quantities of some matter can have impacts like medicine or poison to your body in very small percentages. Yes go to reliable sources, like NASA and Wikipedia or read IPCC report or find some top climate scientist on twitter that most importantly have lot of peer review papers and studies about climate. Google had employed some real climate scientists to show first pages that will be shown about climate change when you type it that are from reliable sources not from fake ones that I can see you are feed with. \"I am not talking of pocket of industrial area.\" There is not \"industrial pockets\", air mix very well with wind, CO2 fluctuation from place to place today are very small, but yes measurable, also CO2 fluctuate with seasons. In winter is higher and in Summer is smaller. But year to year CO2 is going up 2.5ppm every year because our emissions from burning coal, oil an gas. \"In fact there are points in our history where co2 was much higher than today and the planet was more inhabitable and cooler.\" Those periods of very high CO2 in air are 100s of millions of years in the past so SUN was less stronger. Did you know that last time this much CO2 was in air was 3millions years ago and see level was 16feet (5meters) higher?   \n",

Just type in google : CO2 last 800 000 years and you will see. CO2 before industrial revolution in 1750 was 275ppm and today is 415ppm, so we increased CO2 for 50%.   \n",

Also you pointed that you pay taxes for oil subsidies. I prefer to charge my EV on my electricity that I produce and have option to do so and not be FORCED to pay taxes for oil and buy oil that I as regular Joe can't produce it and drive toxic pollution spreading machine on the street where everybody walks .and breath toxic air.

Also environmental impact of African people are 20 times less than from developed countries, but for your information average for EU and US is about 1,8 kids per couple so population is in decline, what is a good thing. No one is banning you to have kids as much as you want but we have to know where we are and we are heading for. I do not drive my fossil car too.   \n",

Are you only spices on the planet?

That land area around have lot of dead animals and other biologic materials stored in permafrost that didn't melt for 500 000years. Now is started to melt. Problem is when this start to decompose it will release very potent green effect methane gas. It have 32 times higher effect than CO2. We have there temp. dependent ticking bomb. Problem is that temp. there is rising much faster then on other places on Earth and you know difference between ice and no ice is small. You have on 30°F ice and on 34°F melted thing. This is why we should limit global temp. to 1,5- 2°C (3,6°F) and that's why this 12years. Because if we continue this pace in 12years we will have point with no return. When this thing start to emit that amount of methane earth will start to heat more, than it melts even more and you get even more gas. The reason why this area from north pole is heating so fast is less and less white snow in summer that reflect sun radiation back in space. So less snow more heating and also more methane gas and more water expansion from heated oceans. If we pass that 2°C, it is unstoppable ! Temp of earth will rise more than 5°C than, you have than Antarctic melting. All ice there is on land so sea level rise rate will be higher, then you have permafrost from there.. Then you have further expansion of ocean because heated water expand and then we can talk about significant sea level rise .. That's why AOC said we will have climate disaster in 12years what is not true. I will be START of climate disaster. She was scared when she did read IPCC sr15 report.   \n",

That land area around have lot of dead animals and other biologic materials stored in permafrost that didn't melt for 500 000years. Now is started to melt. Problem is when this start to decompose it will release very potent green effect methane gas. It have 32 times higher effect than CO2. We have there temp. dependent ticking bomb. Problem is that temp. there is rising much faster then on other places on Earth and you know difference between ice and no ice is small. You have on 30°F ice and on 34°F melted thing. This is why we should limit global temp. to 1,5- 2°C (3,6°F) and that's why this 12years. Because if we continue this pace in 12years we will have point with no return. When this thing start to emit that amount of methane earth will start to heat more, than it melts even more and you get even more gas. The reason why this area from north pole is heating so fast is less and less white snow in summer that reflect sun radiation back in space. So less snow more heating and also more methane gas and more water expansion from heated oceans. If we pass that 2°C, it is unstoppable ! Temp of earth will rise more than 5°C than, you have than Antarctic melting. All ice there is on land so sea level rise rate will be higher, then you have permafrost from there.. Then you have further expansion of ocean because heated water expand and then we can talk about significant sea level rise .. That's why AOC said we will have climate disaster in 12years what is not true. I will be START of climate disaster. She was scared when she did read IPCC sr15 report.   \n",

We never played it live before, as it is a challenging one to play, and place in a set list. It’s emotionally heavy, and would almost “hurt” the rest of the songs in a way. We just really wanted to do this on camera for our fans. Global warming is a reality and a relevant topic, we feel it’s good to be reminded of one of the most important challenges of our time: How to grow as a species without being a parasite to our planet, the only home we have. “We will see our children growing” is a mantra for future generations, and in a figurative way we hope the children in all of us will grow, evolve, and take action for a more compassionate and meaningful world.

This video explains why the production of some foods emit more than others, and which foods to avoid to be a more climate-conscious consumer.

At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

       "      <td>And what the US election means for climate change. Watch more 2020 election explainers at http://vox.com/ElectionVideos All of recorded human history has happened during a period in which the average global temperature didn’t change by more than 1 degree Celsius. But the burning of fossil fuels has triggered a temperature rise projected to exceed 3 degrees by the end of the century. It will be catastrophic. But it can be avoided if we massively scale back the burning of fossil fuels. The US isn’t the biggest emitter of carbon dioxide in the world, but it's emitted more carbon dioxide in total than any other country. So the US has an important role to play in global decarbonization; the world basically can’t get there without the US’s full participation. But the current US president doesn’t have any plans to do that. His Democratic challenger in the 2020 election, Joe Biden, does. Biden’s plan is ambitious: Its goal is to completely transition the US to clean energy by 2050. But his plan doesn’t get into the details of exactly how that will happen. For that, we talked to physicist and engineer Saul Griffith, who took us through his incredibly detailed road map for how the US could actually walk away from fossil fuels in the next 30 years.

Cattle ranchers, loggers, and farmers are mostly to blame for the deforestation, but the demand driving them comes from all around the world. Brazil's economy depends on agriculture, especially beef and soy, which is grown on cleared land in the Amazon. Today, president Jair Bolsonaro, is weakening the environmental protections there in order to give agriculture more power. This came to a head when, in summer 2019, more than 30,000 wildfires burned in the Amazon, sparking worldwide outrage.

It's grown by nearly 125 million farmers, from Latin America to Africa to Asia. But as man-made climate change warms the atmosphere, the notoriously particular coffee plant is struggling. Places like Colombia, which once had the perfect climate to grow Arabica coffee, are changing. Now, experts estimate the amount of land that can sustain coffee will fall 50 percent by 2050. It's not just a crisis for consumers but for the millions who have made a livelihood out of growing coffee.

       "      <td>In this sixth video in the series \"Peak Oil and a Changing Climate\" from The Nation and On The Earth Productions, linguist, philosopher and political activist Noam Chomsky talks about the Chamber of Commerce, the American Petroleum Institute and other business lobbies enthusiastically carrying out campaigns \"to try and convince the population that global warming is a liberal hoax.\" According to Chomsky, this massive public relations campaign has succeeded in leading a good portion of the population into doubting the human causes of global warming. Known for his criticism of the media, Chomsky doesn't hold back in this clip, laying blame on mainstream media outlets such as the New York Times, which will run frontpage articles on what meteorologists think about global warming. \"Meteorologists are pretty faces reading scripts telling you whether it's going to rain tomorrow,\" Chomsky says. \"What do they have to say any more than your barber?\" All this is part of the media's pursuit of \"fabled objectivity.\" Of particular concern for Chomsky is the atmosphere of anger, fear and hostility that currently reigns in America. The public's hatred of Democrats, Republicans, big business and banks and the public's distrust of scientists all lead to general disregard for the findings of \"pointy-headed elitists.\" The 2010 elections could be interpreted as a \"death knell for the species\" because most of the new Republicans in Congress are global warming deniers. \"If this was happening in some small country,\" Chomsky concludes, \"it wouldn't matter much. But when it's happening in the richest, most powerful country in the world, it's a danger to the survival of the species.\" Visit www.TheNation.com to learn more about \"Peak Oil and a Changing Climate,\" and to see the other videos in the series.</td>\n",

       "      <td>President Joe Biden signed several executive actions related to the climate crisis, including one directing the secretary of the interior to pause on entering into new oil and natural gas leases on public lands or offshore waters. Biden and other administration officials have emphasized that the White House is taking a \"whole of government\" approach to climate change. They've also underscored that they believe the President's actions will help spur job growth, and categorized people working in industries vulnerable to job loss, such as coal miners, under their umbrella of environmental justice. \"Today is climate day at the White House and, which means that today is jobs day at the White House. We're talking about American innovation, American products, American labor,\" Biden said at the outset of his remarks at a signing ceremony. \"We're talking about the health of our families and cleaner water cleaner air and cleaner communities. We're talking about national security.\" He continued: \"It's a future of enormous hope and opportunity. It's about coming to the moment to deal with this maximum threat that we exist with as now facing us, climate change, with a greater sense of urgency. In my view, we've already waited too long to deal with this climate crisis. We can't wait any longer.\" The executive order on oil and natural gas leases directs the interior secretary to launch a \"rigorous review\" of the existing leasing and permitting programs related to fossil fuel development, and to identify steps to double renewable energy production from offshore wind by 2030, according to a fact sheet provided by the White House. The halting of new leases fulfills a campaign promise by Biden and will expand an existing 60-day moratorium issued by the President on his first day in office. Biden's climate actions mark a sharp departure from the Trump administration's efforts to maximize fossil fuel production and expand oil and gas drilling on federal lands but climate emissaries for the administration emphasized they hope to build new job opportunities out of the changes. White House climate czar Gina McCarthy described the order as one that \"directs everyone who works for the President to use every tool available at our disposal to solve the climate crisis. Because we're going to take a whole of government approach.\" #CNN #News #ClimateChange</td>\n",

It’s the only American plan that actually acknowledges the size of the impending crisis. And it contains some difficult truths that we might not want to hear. Read the Green New Deal resolution here: https://ocasio-cortez.house.gov/sites/ocasio-cortez.house.gov/files/Resolution%20on%20a%20Green%20New%20Deal.pdf For additional context I recommend this piece by Vox’s Umair Irfan on the United Nations climate report, where the world’s best climatologists tell us how urgent of a problem this is: https://www.vox.com/2018/10/8/17948832/climate-change-global-warming-un-ipcc-report This piece from Vox’s David Roberts, shows that world leaders really aren’t taking this urgency seriously. https://www.vox.com/2016/10/4/13118594/2-degrees-no-more-fossil-fuels Finally, you should read this explainer of the Green New Deal, followed by this story (in list form) by Hannah Northey: https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/12/21/18144138/green-new-deal-alexandria-ocasio-cortez https://www.eenews.net/stories/1060106501 I also enjoyed this piece, from Kate Aronoff of the Intercept, that imagines a world after the Green New Deal: https://theintercept.com/2018/12/05/green-new-deal-proposal-impacts/ Vox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

No? Well I personally had no idea. One day it just hit me, I knew very little about climate change. Even with a useless degree in chemistry, climate change is a confusing mess of strange and difficult to understand information. I made this video to gather all the facts I could find about climate change, in a fun way, and without any bias on my part. I wanted anyone who watched this video (and myself too!) to understand all the important facts relating to climate change. Non-scientists welcome. Science is exciting! It’s just school and most of our education systems aren’t… In a few months this video will be uploaded as to remove any language or scenes not suitable for schools, so it can be used to teach about climate change in schools.

In the year 2019 we were still pumping out around 37 billion more. That’s 50% more than the year 2000 and almost three times as much as 50 years ago. And it’s not just CO2. We’re also pumping out growing volumes of other greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide. Combining all of our greenhouse gases, we’re emitting 51 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents each year. And emissions keep rising – but they need to get down to 0!

The urgent need to address the issues facing the planet and all that inhabit it were on the forefront of Michael’s mind when he created this song and short film; issues that are even more urgent today.

We never played it live before, as it is a challenging one to play, and place in a set list. It’s emotionally heavy, and would almost “hurt” the rest of the songs in a way. We just really wanted to do this on camera for our fans. Global warming is a reality and a relevant topic, we feel it’s good to be reminded of one of the most important challenges of our time: How to grow as a species without being a parasite to our planet, the only home we have. “We will see our children growing” is a mantra for future generations, and in a figurative way we hope the children in all of us will grow, evolve, and take action for a more compassionate and meaningful world.

In the first scenario, Bangladesh has been inundated by rising sea levels, causing great suffering; in the second scenario, fossil fuels have been replaced by renewable energy, and Bangladesh is prosperous. The purpose of this film is to teach children about fossil fuels and climate change. \"Tomorrow \" A production of Kazi Media Limited Directed by Mohammad Shihab Uddin Produced by Kazi Zahin Hasan and Kazi Zeeshan Hasan Animation services provided by Cycore Studios Connect with Deepto TV: YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/DeeptoTV Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deeptotv.bd Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/deepto.tv Twitter: https://twitter.com/deeptotv Deepto TV address: 7/A/GA Tejgaon Industrial Area, Dhaka 1208, BANGLADESH *** COPYRIGHT WARNING *** The copyright of this content is reserved solely by Kazi Media Limited.

A recent opinion piece in the New York Times argued that scientists got climate change wrong https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/08/opinion/sunday/science-climate-change.html But did they really? In this video we speak about the uncertainty of climate predictions, tipping points, what we know, what we do not know about the trends, and what policy consequences to draw from that.

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab Our consumption habits emit billions of tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Our diets account for one-fourth of those emissions. The food we eat emits so many greenhouse emissions because of the land it takes to grow it, but it also has something to do with biology. This video explains why the production of some foods emit more than others, and which foods to avoid to be a more climate-conscious consumer. This video was based on this chart, created by the University of Oxford’s Our World in Data: https://ourworldindata.org/food-choice-vs-eating-local Sources: For more Vox.com coverage of food emissions: https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/2/20/21144017/local-food-carbon-footprint-climate-environment For more of Our World in Data’s data on the emissions related to food production: https://ourworldindata.org/environmental-impacts-of-food A lecture given by Joseph Poore, co-author of the study this chart was based on: https://youtu.be/8miQs3mPGu8 Cow and sheep burping footage: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDjEqYR6CGE https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNrFdrxIToo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgGSqJDzN6o https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9yRdVAmAag https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLJqZknei9I https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPmweCJgvIM https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fHjmPQl8FU Vox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Subscribe to our channel! https://www.youtube.com/crookedmedia?sub_confirmation=1 Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

The footage was recorded by the conservation group Sea Legacy during a late summer expedition in Baffin Island. 'My entire Sea Legacy team was pushing through their tears and emotions while documenting this dying polar bear,' the photographer Paul Nicklen wrote on social media.

Watch more 2020 election explainers at http://vox.com/ElectionVideos All of recorded human history has happened during a period in which the average global temperature didn’t change by more than 1 degree Celsius. But the burning of fossil fuels has triggered a temperature rise projected to exceed 3 degrees by the end of the century. It will be catastrophic. But it can be avoided if we massively scale back the burning of fossil fuels. The US isn’t the biggest emitter of carbon dioxide in the world, but it's emitted more carbon dioxide in total than any other country. So the US has an important role to play in global decarbonization; the world basically can’t get there without the US’s full participation. But the current US president doesn’t have any plans to do that. His Democratic challenger in the 2020 election, Joe Biden, does. Biden’s plan is ambitious: Its goal is to completely transition the US to clean energy by 2050. But his plan doesn’t get into the details of exactly how that will happen. For that, we talked to physicist and engineer Saul Griffith, who took us through his incredibly detailed road map for how the US could actually walk away from fossil fuels in the next 30 years. This was the first in our series of 2020 election explainers, all based on viewer suggestions.

This is the first episode of Climate Lab, a six-part series produced by the University of California in partnership with Vox. Hosted by Emmy-nominated conservation scientist Dr. M. Sanjayan, the videos explore the surprising elements of our lives that contribute to climate change and the groundbreaking work being done to fight back. Featuring conversations with experts, scientists, thought leaders and activists, the series takes what can seem like an overwhelming problem and breaks it down into manageable parts: from clean energy to food waste, religion to smartphones.

This is Part 1 of Vox Atlas: The Amazon, a three-part series about the world's largest rainforest, why it's in jeopardy, and the people trying to save it. Watch all three parts right here on YouTube.

Cattle ranchers, loggers, and farmers are mostly to blame for the deforestation, but the demand driving them comes from all around the world. Brazil's economy depends on agriculture, especially beef and soy, which is grown on cleared land in the Amazon. Today, president Jair Bolsonaro, is weakening the environmental protections there in order to give agriculture more power. This came to a head when, in summer 2019, more than 30,000 wildfires burned in the Amazon, sparking worldwide outrage. Here are some sources I found particularly helpful while reporting for this story: Nepstad, et al. 2014 https://science.sciencemag.org/content/344/6188/1118 Umair Irfan, Vox: https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2019/11/18/20970604/amazon-rainforest-2019-brazil-burning-deforestation-bolsonaro The Intercept: https://theintercept.com/2019/07/06/brazil-amazon-rainforest-indigenous-conservation-agribusiness-ranching/ Vox Atlas demonstrates where conflicts occur on a map and the ways in which foreign policy shapes a region.

In fact, recent research has shown that three-quarters of Earth’s land surface is under pressure from human activity. In this short film, spoken word artist Prince Ea makes a powerful case for protecting the planet and challenges the human race to create a sustainable future.

Here’s the best one I’ve found to date along with some counter-arguments and evidence. It looks at whether CO2 is saturated in the atmosphere and more CO2 will now make minimal additional impact on warming. We get into the science at a molecular level on this one!

It's grown by nearly 125 million farmers, from Latin America to Africa to Asia. But as man-made climate change warms the atmosphere, the notoriously particular coffee plant is struggling. Places like Colombia, which once had the perfect climate to grow Arabica coffee, are changing. Now, experts estimate the amount of land that can sustain coffee will fall 50 percent by 2050. It's not just a crisis for consumers but for the millions who have made a livelihood out of growing coffee.

Known for his criticism of the media, Chomsky doesn't hold back in this clip, laying blame on mainstream media outlets such as the New York Times, which will run frontpage articles on what meteorologists think about global warming. \"Meteorologists are pretty faces reading scripts telling you whether it's going to rain tomorrow,\" Chomsky says. \"What do they have to say any more than your barber?\" All this is part of the media's pursuit of \"fabled objectivity.\" Of particular concern for Chomsky is the atmosphere of anger, fear and hostility that currently reigns in America. The public's hatred of Democrats, Republicans, big business and banks and the public's distrust of scientists all lead to general disregard for the findings of \"pointy-headed elitists.\" The 2010 elections could be interpreted as a \"death knell for the species\" because most of the new Republicans in Congress are global warming deniers. \"If this was happening in some small country,\" Chomsky concludes, \"it wouldn't matter much. But when it's happening in the richest, most powerful country in the world, it's a danger to the survival of the species.\" Visit www.TheNation.com to learn more about \"Peak Oil and a Changing Climate,\" and to see the other videos in the series.   \n",

The message came with his signing a robust set of executive climate actions. CBS News meteorologist and climate specialist Jeff Berardelli spoke with White House National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy as well as first deputy White House National Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi and joins CBSN to explain his take on the Biden climate team.

Biden and other administration officials have emphasized that the White House is taking a \"whole of government\" approach to climate change. They've also underscored that they believe the President's actions will help spur job growth, and categorized people working in industries vulnerable to job loss, such as coal miners, under their umbrella of environmental justice. \"Today is climate day at the White House and, which means that today is jobs day at the White House. We're talking about American innovation, American products, American labor,\" Biden said at the outset of his remarks at a signing ceremony. \"We're talking about the health of our families and cleaner water cleaner air and cleaner communities. We're talking about national security.\" He continued: \"It's a future of enormous hope and opportunity. It's about coming to the moment to deal with this maximum threat that we exist with as now facing us, climate change, with a greater sense of urgency. In my view, we've already waited too long to deal with this climate crisis. We can't wait any longer.\" The executive order on oil and natural gas leases directs the interior secretary to launch a \"rigorous review\" of the existing leasing and permitting programs related to fossil fuel development, and to identify steps to double renewable energy production from offshore wind by 2030, according to a fact sheet provided by the White House. The halting of new leases fulfills a campaign promise by Biden and will expand an existing 60-day moratorium issued by the President on his first day in office. Biden's climate actions mark a sharp departure from the Trump administration's efforts to maximize fossil fuel production and expand oil and gas drilling on federal lands but climate emissaries for the administration emphasized they hope to build new job opportunities out of the changes. White House climate czar Gina McCarthy described the order as one that \"directs everyone who works for the President to use every tool available at our disposal to solve the climate crisis. Because we're going to take a whole of government approach.\" #CNN #News #ClimateChange   \n",

Read the Green New Deal resolution here: https://ocasio-cortez.house.gov/sites/ocasio-cortez.house.gov/files/Resolution%20on%20a%20Green%20New%20Deal.pdf For additional context I recommend this piece by Vox’s Umair Irfan on the United Nations climate report, where the world’s best climatologists tell us how urgent of a problem this is: https://www.vox.com/2018/10/8/17948832/climate-change-global-warming-un-ipcc-report This piece from Vox’s David Roberts, shows that world leaders really aren’t taking this urgency seriously. https://www.vox.com/2016/10/4/13118594/2-degrees-no-more-fossil-fuels Finally, you should read this explainer of the Green New Deal, followed by this story (in list form) by Hannah Northey: https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/12/21/18144138/green-new-deal-alexandria-ocasio-cortez https://www.eenews.net/stories/1060106501 I also enjoyed this piece, from Kate Aronoff of the Intercept, that imagines a world after the Green New Deal: https://theintercept.com/2018/12/05/green-new-deal-proposal-impacts/ Vox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

What is Climate Change? Do you know the facts? No? Well I personally had no idea. One day it just hit me, I knew very little about climate change. Even with a useless degree in chemistry, climate change is a confusing mess of strange and difficult to understand information. I made this video to gather all the facts I could find about climate change, in a fun way, and without any bias on my part. I wanted anyone who watched this video (and myself too!) to understand all the important facts relating to climate change. Non-scientists welcome. Science is exciting! It’s just school and most of our education systems aren’t… In a few months this video will be uploaded as to remove any language or scenes not suitable for schools, so it can be used to teach about climate change in schools.

In the year 2019 we were still pumping out around 37 billion more. That’s 50% more than the year 2000 and almost three times as much as 50 years ago. And it’s not just CO2. We’re also pumping out growing volumes of other greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide. Combining all of our greenhouse gases, we’re emitting 51 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents each year. And emissions keep rising – but they need to get down to 0!

The urgent need to address the issues facing the planet and all that inhabit it were on the forefront of Michael’s mind when he created this song and short film; issues that are even more urgent today.
