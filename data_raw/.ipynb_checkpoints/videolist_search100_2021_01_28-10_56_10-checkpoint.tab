The Amazon Rainforest is big news right now as fires continue to consume its lush landscape. It’s essential to our planet’s climate, ecosystem, and more. If we do nothing, the Amazon could be gone within 100 years. What would that mean for us? Well, did you know that a lot of the ingredients in our modern medicines come from the plants of the Amazon? These include the most important medications, such as essential vaccines. Millions of people depend on the Amazon basin for their income. So it would certainly be devastating for South American people. Also, if the fires continue, not only will we lose the huge oxygen source, but extra pollution will be released. And that is not all!

If it was suddenly gone, a lot of South America’s exports and businesses would disappear with it. - Our planet gets 20% of its oxygen from this Rainforest, due to its massive size. - Covering just over 2 million square miles, the Amazon is home to 30% of our planet’s wildlife. - If the Amazon were destroyed, you can kiss your morning joe goodbye, in addition to fruits, rice, and CHOCOLATE, just to name a few. - In addition to oxygen and medicinal plants, we’d also lose a substantial supplier of minerals, fresh water, and food. - Science has shown that rainforests, in general, influence the climate both globally and locally. - Unhealthy soil would add to the disaster: excessive rain + unanchored soil = mudslide. Farmland and homes would be overcome with rain and mud. - Rural people will be forced into the cities, which are already home to millions. This will cause overcrowding, which comes with its own problems.

Cattle ranchers, loggers, and farmers are mostly to blame for the deforestation, but the demand driving them comes from all around the world. Brazil's economy depends on agriculture, especially beef and soy, which is grown on cleared land in the Amazon. Today, president Jair Bolsonaro, is weakening the environmental protections there in order to give agriculture more power. This came to a head when, in summer 2019, more than 30,000 wildfires burned in the Amazon, sparking worldwide outrage.

But how much can trees really do to tackle global warming? See our research here: https://econ.st/32HXvXY Click here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: https://econ.st/2xvTKdy Summer 2019 - More than 38,000 fires raged across the Amazon. Fires that were man-made. Over the past 50 years almost 17% of the world’s largest rainforest has been cleared. And globally deforestation has almost doubled in just five years. Since the start of human civilisation it’s estimated that the number of trees around the world has fallen by almost half. Clearing forests increases carbon-dioxide levels but planting them could store away some of the carbon already in the atmosphere. This woman runs safaris in England. Guests are not only here to see wild animals - they’re here to see wild trees. Almost 20 years ago Isabella Tree—yes that is her real name-handed 1,400 hectares of Sussex farmland back to nature, by doing, well nothing. She thinks this is the best way to use the land to help tackle climate change. To stabilise the climate global carbon emissions need to drop to net zero by 2050. Simon Lewis is a professor of global change science. And there’s never been more global ambition to plant trees. In 2014, 51 countries pledged to plant over 3.5m square kilometres of forest by 2030 - an area slightly larger than India. The 2030 target looks likely to be met. But there’s a catch… Monoculture tree plantations like eucalyptus grow quickly but the trees are harvested every ten or so years releasing much of the carbon stored in the tree back into the atmosphere - which means that, according to some studies they’ll store only around one-fortieth of the carbon natural forests do over the long term. In fact, those pledges to plant millions of trees actually promise to store 26bn tonnes less carbon than they could. Sometimes the motives for planting forests are less green than they might appear. By 2020 Ireland ought to have cut greenhouse-gas emissions by 20% below 2005 levels. But at current rates it will have reduced them by only 5%. Planting forests might help Ireland avoid massive penalties for missing EU targets because the potential carbon these forests could store in the future can be counted as a carbon credit today. In the 1920s Ireland had the lowest forest cover in Europe at around 1%. That’s now risen to 11% and the government has set a target to cover 18% of the land with forest by 2046. And now local community groups are protesting against these monoculture tree plantations. They say they’re doing more harm than good. Tree-planting programmes invariably have an impact on the people living nearby. In east Africa one project is demonstrating what can be achieved when there’s genuine buy-in from the local communities. Green Ethiopia is a mixed-tree planting charity. The land is communally owned and co-operatives of local women receive benefits for planting trees which are protected from being harvested. Here conserving is just as important as planting. Green Ethiopia assesses whether the condition of the land is good enough to regenerate by itself. When it is—on about a third of the area the charity runs they leave it alone. Just like Isabella Tree, back in England. Monoculture plantations are often preferred because they make money. So some experts are looking to a future where carbon payments could create financial incentives for natural forests. Ultimately though, the trouble with trees tackling climate change is space For more from Economist Films visit: http://films.economist.com/ Check out The Economist’s full video catalogue: http://econ.st/20IehQk Like The Economist on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheEconomist/ Follow The Economist on Twitter: https://twitter.com/theeconomist Follow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/theeconomist/ Follow us on Medium: https://medium.com/@the_economist	The Economist,Economist,Economist Films,Economist Videos,News,short-documentary,climate change,global warming,global warming short film,climate,environment,greenhouse gases,climate change news,climate crisis,climate change solutions,planting trees,trees	25	News & Politics	PT9M45S	585	2d	hd	true	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EXkbdELr4EQ/maxresdefault.jpg	1	429720	11866	843	0	1771

The trees are much taller and denser, so the carbon content of the African rainforest is as much as double as that of the Amazon. So in terms of climate change, the African rainforest/ Congo Basin is twice as important as its surface area. There is a clear link between the rainforest of Eastern Dem. Republic of Congo and the rainfall in the Ethiopian Highlands. So if we cut down the forests of DRC, not only will we put more CO2 in to the atmosphere, but Ethiopia will also loose its rainfall. It's likely that the same relationship will apply to Gabon and Congo, and the Sahel. In all the rainforest models they predict that in the next 20 - 30 years, Sahel will loose half of its rain fall, because of climate change. So we a responsibility in the Congo Basin, the DRC, The Congo and Gabon, because we know that the people in Sahel will die if we cut down the rainforest.

Of this $100 million, $40 million will be allocated under the MTSRF to develop collaborative, public benefit research between Australia's best tropical environmental researchers to support the conservation and sustainable use of North Queensland's environmental assets - the Wet Tropics rainforests, the Great Barrier Reef and the connecting coastal regions. The MTSRF has produced 28 multimedia Visual Documentation clips using contributions from research projects being conducted under the MTSRF program. The purpose of the Visual Documentation is to provide video documentation of the work being undertaken within the MTSRF program. These multimedia products have been designed to easily incorporate and portray new results obtained from the MTSRF work, enabling a visual record of the MTSRF work, the research projects and the environmental assets of North Queensland to be compiled.

SUBSCRIBE so you don’t miss a video! ►► http://bit.ly/iotbs_sub We’re on PATREON now! Join the community ►► https://www.patreon.com/itsokaytobesmart ↓↓↓ More info and sources below ↓↓↓ Can trees really save us from climate change? For eons, nature has relied on photosynthesis as a big way to keep carbon dioxide levels from getting out of control. But as we have put more carbon into the air, we’ve also cut down many of the forests we need to suck that carbon up. So big tree-planting initiatives like #TeamTrees to the rescue, right? Actually, we need to think bigger. Here’s three ways trees really can help us solve climate change, from a guy who wants to plant a TRILLION trees, to how we might save the forests we’ve got, to scientists hacking biology to make trees even better.

The global deforestation is leading to growing problems. Nigeria and the DRC Congo - two of Europe’s main charcoal suppliers - are also affected. Every year, Europeans use approximately 800,000 tons of charcoal for barbecuing. Seventy percent of the charcoal comes from outside the EU, and the bags often contain remnants of tropical woods. Officially, tropical woods are subject to strict import conditions. But when it comes to wood charcoal, these do not apply. Worldwide, 2.7 billion people cook and heat with wood or charcoal. The related emission of greenhouse gases is enormous. 55 percent of global wood is used as fuel per year, and much of it is cut illegally in Africa’s bush and tropical forests. Nigeria produces most of its charcoal for export. Especially during dry periods, local Nigerian farmers use coal production as a lifeline to make money and feed their families. At the same time, charcoal mills travel the countryside in family groups, charring all the trees they can cut down. The consequences are hair-raising. Nigeria lost 36 percent of its forests between 1990 and 2005. At present, twelve percent of the country is still covered with forest - but charcoal production continues to rise, eating up 350,000 hectares of fertile land here every year. According to the UN, charcoal production is one of the main causes of deforestation in Africa, which in turn is closely linked to massive deterioration in soil quality and a growing risk of crop failure. But African legislation has been slow to respond to the problem. The coal business is highly lucrative business, and rakes in some 7.4 billion US Dollars a year. According to recent estimates, the current illegal trade in charcoal is worth almost three times as much as the trade in illegal drugs. -------------------------------------------------------------------- DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Along the way, he also served as CTO for two startups in San Francisco, where he obtained industry-level experience in software development — the foundation of the Rainforest Connection platform. Rainforest Connection (RFCx) is an innovative nonprofit startup at the forefront of conservation technology committed to applying the most effective and timely technology to protect our planet’s precious, ancient forests and wildlife from illegal logging and poaching. RFCx listens to the rainforest remotely, using commonplace mobile tech and existing telecommunications infrastructure, and transforms these audio streams into a profound and automatic understanding of the forest soundscape, rooting out any threats using AI/ML models. RFCx partners with local NGOs and indigenous tribes to deter incursions through real-time threat detection and provides forensic evidence to enable governments to take action to prevent further incursions. They make this data available to academic researchers and government agencies to assist the fields of field ecology and conservation. RFCx is able to cheaply and effectively protect rainforests around the world, with current projects in 11 countries on 5 continents monitoring over 3,000 sq km of rainforest. Conserving rainforests is one of the cheapest and fastest ways to slow climate change today. One acoustic monitoring device, protecting 3 sq km of forest, equates to 15k tons of CO2 sequestered or taking 3,000 cars off the road. RFCx will have expanded into 5 new regions by Spring of 2020. As they work toward a future of plug and play acoustic monitoring devices, they will be able to protect vast expanses of threatened ecosystems even more cheaply. This is needed as soon as possible, as the past solutions of on-ground patrols, camera traps, and satellite imagery are relatively ineffective to protect these large, dense reserves.

Come explore the vast interactive network of plants, animal, and insects in tropical rainforests. Fueled by sunlight and rain, rainforests are some of the most diverse energy-rich ecosystems on the planet. In addition to showcasing live footage from a unique ecosystem, each of the three videos in the Exploring Ecosystems series features an opportunity for students to actively participate in a problem-solving scenario based on an ongoing research project of an Academy scientist like Michelle Trautwein. As you watch the video, be prepared to pause at key points to participate fully! Explore arthropods, insects like Leafcutter ants (Atta colombica or Atta cephalotes) or katydids (Tettigoniidae), and amphibians like the Poison Dart Frog (Dendrobatidae). The Tropical Rainforest Diversity video investigates the following questions: How does the biodiversity within an ecosystem influence the stability of that ecosystem? How can we make rainforests more resilient to change and human-induced disruptions like deforestation and climate change? What are the four main layers of the rainforest, and how are the conditions within each allowing certain species to thrive? Check for Understanding Which of the three hypothetical rainforest communities was most diverse, and why is that important? Connect your answer to the ideas of species richness and species abundance, being sure to differentiate the two. Key Scientific Terms abiotic: non-living biodiversity: the variety of life on Earth or some other specified geographic region of the planet; the diversity of life occurs at the genetic level, at the species level, at the ecosystem level, and in evolutionary lineages ecosystem: the community of different species in a particular geographic area and all of their interactions with each other and the physical environment; ecosystems are also called ecological networks photosynthesis: the process of capturing the energy in sunlight to create energy-rich organic molecules from inorganic molecules; organisms that photosynthesize are called photosynthesizers species: a distinct type of organism species richness: the number of different species in a given geographic area Connections to High School Standards AP Biology (1) Justify the selection of mathematical routines to solve problems. (2) Apply mathematical routines to quantities that describe natural phenomena. Essential knowledge 4.C.4: The diversity of species within an ecosystem may influence the stability of the ecosystem.

The team, including some of the world’s foremost climate change experts, aims to collect data from the forest to help in our understanding of how climate change is affecting our planet. But the forest sits atop a mountain, and to reach it, the team must first climb a sheer 100m wall of rock. The scientists’ work is based on research conducted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, recipients of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007. ➡ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe About National Geographic: National Geographic is the world's premium destination for science, exploration, and adventure.

And now, the dangers caused by tons of melting ice are rising sharply. Every year, climate change is destroying two of the currently 70 square kilometers of glaciers left in the Alps. The permafrost in the Alps is thawing, and transforming what used to be sturdy slopes into loose screes. In addition, climate change is leading to significantly more extreme weather conditions every year, while heavy rainfall causes serious erosion. The result: avalanches and landslides like those in Bondo, Switzerland, or Valsertal in Austria. In Switzerland, residential areas are shrinking as people are forced to leave their homes forever. The disappearance of glaciers as water reservoirs is already posing a major problem. Farmers in Engadine, who have been using meltwater for irrigation for centuries, are already facing water shortages. Last summer, they had to rely on helicopters to transport water to their herds in the Grison Alps. Above all, alpine villages depend on winter tourism to survive. Yet experts are forecasting that by mid-century, there will only be enough natural snow left to ski above 2,000 meters, which will spell out the end for about 70 percent of the ski resorts in the Eastern Alps. But instead of developing alternatives, lots of money is still being invested in ski tourism. Snow cannon are used to defy climate change, and artificial snow systems are under construction at ever higher altitudes. As usual, it’s the environment that is set to lose as the unique alpine landscape is further destroyed by soil compaction and erosion. Some municipalities are now working on new models of alpine tourism for the future. As global temperatures continue to rise, the cooler mountain regions will become increasingly attractive for tourists, especially in the summer. -------------------------------------------------------------------- DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

The scientists who work at this outpost in Antarctica are studying the effects of climate change -- under extreme conditions. Journalist Matthias Ebert traveled to the station to find out more about their research. The scientists are particularly concerned about the speed at which Antarctic ice is melting - and its impact on global sea levels. The researchers have also been studying a large colony of emperor penguins that lives near their facility -- to find out more about how these birds are adapting to climate change. Ebert reports on the daily lives of the scientists who work at the Neumayer Station, and how they cope with the extreme weather conditions, isolation, and cramped quarters. They've even managed to grow some of their own food in a greenhouse at the facility. Ebert documents the damaging effect that global warming is having on the Antarctic, and the risk that this poses for the rest of the world. -------------------------------------------------------------------- DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

And terrifyingly, it's happening to about two-thirds of the world's grasslands, accelerating climate change and causing traditional grazing societies to descend into social chaos. Savory has devoted his life to stopping it. He now believes -- and his work so far shows -- that a surprising factor can protect grasslands and even reclaim degraded land that was once desert.

This success has been achieved despite high beef and soy prices, which in previous years had pushed deforestation upward, and during a time that Brazil had rapid economic growth and made important progress in reducing poverty, hunger, and inequality. Brazil’s reduction in emissions from deforestation is the largest contribution so far by any country—rich or poor—to reducing global warming pollution.” Deforestation: Facts, Causes & Effects http://www.livescience.com/27692-deforestation.html “Deforestation is the permanent destruction of forests in order to make the land available for other uses. An estimated 18 million acres (7.3 million hectares) of forest, which is roughly the size of the country of Panama, are lost each year, according to the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).” Tropical Deforestation Affects Rainfall in the U.S. and Around the Globe https://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2005/deforest_rainfall.html “Today, scientists estimate that between one-third and one-half of our planet's land surfaces have been transformed by human development. Now, a new study is offering insight into the long-term impacts of these changes, particularly the effects of large-scale deforestation in tropical regions on the global climate.” ____________________ Seeker inspires us to see the world through the lens of science and evokes a sense of curiosity, optimism and adventure.

Willful human destruction of the rainforest by slash-and-burn techniques (trees are toppled by chainsaw or tractors with chains, allowed to dry out, and are then torched) is behind 99% of the present fires, according to some accounts.

Did you know that algae and trees were the first forms of life on earth five million years ago? It was because they produced oxygen that human beings could evolve so quickly. Today, there are billions of people inhabiting our planet, and our living environment has undergone many changes. Do we still need trees? Absolutely! After all, the algae in the oceans and the trees on land produce the largest percentage of oxygen on earth. And we can’t live without oxygen. They also absorb CO2 from the air. This is a good thing because the increasing emission of greenhouse gases is releasing so much CO2 into the atmosphere that the result is an acceleration of global warming. By absorbing CO2, trees are slowing this process immediately. And did you know that a large part of fine dust or particulate matter we produce is filtered out of the air by trees? This means they are making the air a lot healthier. But this isn’t all. A single tree supports the lives of more than 250 species of plants and animals and so contributes to biodiversity. For instance, with its pollen bee colonies can pollinate other plants and keep them reproducing. Furthermore, trees provide a natural cooling effect, enhance good drainage, serve as shelter from the wind... and make people… happier! Happier? Absolutely! Because we’re more creative, more involved with others, and more active when we’re surrounded by trees. So we also smile more often and are less often sick. When you think about it, trees are really fantastic! But all over the world - even in the Netherlands! - the number of trees is declining. The trees that remain can no longer deal with our CO2 emissions! Couldn’t we reverse this trend? Yes, we can! In the middle of Brabant in the Netherlands there are many people who know how important trees are. These are the people who run the nurseries of GreenPort Midden Brabant, amongst others Tree & Plant Nursery M. van den Oever. They really want to change things around and make the world a greener place. They apply 100% sustainable methods to let young trees grow, to make them useful for fulfilling their important work elsewhere. This is actually making the middle of Brabant a ‘green cradle’ for both the Netherlands and other countries. They also collaborate with artists and designers to devise new ways to make our world greener. In this way, more people can understand how important trees are for a safe, healthy and attractive living environment. After all, we wouldn’t even be here without plants! Forests contribute to climate stability in many important ways, including creating regular rainfall patterns. If you are experiencing drought in your area, it may well be because of deforestation. In this video we'll learn about how human activity has a negative impact on the Earth because of burning fossil fuels, deforestation and creating waste. What will you do to make our world greener?

As the planet heats up, we are witnessing extreme weather changes. If we reach a 2-degree rise, the planet will face serious consequences. We need to stop this. According to scientists, if the world reaches a 2 degree increase, there is no turning back as we are sure to head towards a 4 degrees rise in temperature in a very short time. It would be devastating for everyone living on the planet. The video presentation offers some ideas on how the rainforest has an important role on the ecosystem of the planet's sustainability and the need to protect it. Deforestation around the globe contributes to about 18% to 25% of CO2 emissions (even greater than GHG emissions from transport sector). So, in order to mitigate global warming, the first and major step that should be taken is to protect the natural cooling system of the planet that has been doing its part for millions of years. We need to protect our Rainforests - The Amazon Rainforest and The Borneo Rainforest.		22	People & Blogs	PT1M26S	86	2d	sd	false			95	0	0	0	1

If we don't do anything to stop it, we'll soon find out. The Amazon rainforest creates 20% of the Earth's oxygen. It's home to 30% of the planet's species, and it holds the secrets to treating some of our most deadly diseases. If we destroy the Amazon rainforest, the consequences would be disastrous, and they'd be felt all around the world. Could we survive without it? Correction: we got the percentage wrong at 00:16. Tropical rainforests are responsible for 20% of all photosynthesis (and not oxygen production). Academics say this is a very common misconception, and that the figure is less than 10%. For more on this and other questions, the BBC has put together a great article on the facts around the amazon fires: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-49450925 Transcript and sources: https://insh.world/science/what-if-we-lost-the-amazon-rainforest/ Watch more what-if scenarios: Planet Earth: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-HhCwYD7rc&list=PLZdXRHYAVxTJCzxwmCq0NNpYq9N9wyb2l The Cosmos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfuJyVkMH_g&list=PLZdXRHYAVxTJno6oFF9nLGuwXNGYHmE8U Technology: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CS3bBO05fpU&list=PLZdXRHYAVxTIeRY3JtgXgoGqSEB7kDdKO Your Body: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmXR46TrbA8&list=PLZdXRHYAVxTJNsV9FFeNAKl2ySsHj8GZO Humanity: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdCDQIyXGnw&list=PLZdXRHYAVxTIFnvmOeWbv-Mt8zFxSCSvZ What If elsewhere: IG: https://www.instagram.com/whatif.show/ Twitter: https://twitter.com/WhatIfScience Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/What.If.science Suggest an episode: http://bit.ly/suggest-whatif T-shirts and merch: http://bit.ly/whatifshop "Imagination will often carry us to worlds that never were.

On his visit to the state, the US President said "it'll start getting cooler - you just watch" to a civil servant, who replied: "I wish science agreed with you." Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden called Mr Trump's denial of climate change "unconscionable", saying these "hellish events" will become more frequent if he wins a second term.

The Amazon could turn into a source of carbon in the atmosphere, instead of one of the biggest absorbers of the gas, as soon as the next decade, owing to the damage caused by loggers and farming interests and the impacts of the climate crisis, new research has found. If that happens, climate breakdown is likely to become much more severe in its impacts, and the world will have to cut down much faster on carbon-producing activities to counteract the loss of the carbon sinks. “We’ve found that one of the most worrying impacts of climate change has already begun,” said Simon Lewis, professor in the school of geography at Leeds University, one of the senior authors of the research. “This is decades ahead of even the most pessimistic climate models.”" #TheDamageReport #JohnIadarola #TheYoungTurks	200305__DR07meanwhileInTheAmazon,News,Politics,amazon rainforest carbon,amazon rainforest benefits,amazon rainforest climate change,amazon rainforest,amazon rainforest climate,amazon rainforest weather,amazon rainforest deforestation,amazon rainforest feedback,amazon forest,carbon dioxide,carbon dioxide cycle,co2 emissions,co2 levels,co2,rainforest,amazon,climate crisis,climate change,environmentalism,sustainability,greta thunberg,green new deal,bernie sanders	25	News & Politics	PT3M50S	230	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fRF245N-qPs/maxresdefault.jpg	1	17705	1332	15	0	236

Extinction is now happening up to 100 times faster than the natural evolutionary rate, but the issue is about more than the loss of individual species. Everything in the natural world is connected in networks that support the whole of life on earth, including us, and we are losing many of the benefits that nature provides to us. The loss of insects is threatening the pollination of crops, while the loss of biodiversity in the soil also threatens plants growth. Plants underpin many of the things that we need, and yet one in four is now threatened with extinction. Last year, a UN report identified the key drivers of biodiversity loss, including overfishing, climate change and pollution. But the single biggest driver of biodiversity loss is the destruction of natural habitats. Seventy-five per cent of Earth's land surface (where not covered by ice) has been changed by humans, much of it for agriculture, and as consumers we may unwittingly be contributing towards the loss of species through what we buy in the supermarket. Our destructive relationship with the natural world isn’t just putting the ecosystems that we rely on at risk. Human activities like the trade in animals and the destruction of habitats drive the emergence of diseases. Disease ecologists believe that if we continue on this pathway, this year’s pandemic will not be a one-off event.

Of this $100 million, $40 million will be allocated under the MTSRF to develop collaborative, public benefit research between Australia's best tropical environmental researchers to support the conservation and sustainable use of North Queensland's environmental assets - the Wet Tropics rainforests, the Great Barrier Reef and the connecting coastal regions. The MTSRF has produced 28 multimedia Visual Documentation clips using contributions from research projects being conducted under the MTSRF program. The purpose of the Visual Documentation is to provide video documentation of the work being undertaken within the MTSRF program. These multimedia products have been designed to easily incorporate and portray new results obtained from the MTSRF work, enabling a visual record of the MTSRF work, the research projects and the environmental assets of North Queensland to be compiled.

(Subscribe: https://bit.ly/C4_News_Subscribe) It results from the pro-farming policy being pursued by Brazil's new President Jair Bolsonaro. The Amazon is the world's largest rainforest, however today it is shrinking faster than any other. In the first of two reports from the rainforest, we have been to the Karu Indigenous Reserve in the Brazilian state of Maranhão, where one tribe is resisting the destruction of what could be one of the last natural defences against climate change. ----------------------- Get more news at our site - https://www.channel4.com/news/ Follow us: Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/Channel4News/ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Channel4News	channel 4 news,Amazon,amazonia,amazon forest,amazon jungle,the amazon,amazon rainforest,amazon tribe,tribes,bolsonaro,jair bolsonaro,amazon tribe drone,rainforest,the amazon rainforest,amazon tribes,amazon people,deforestation,brazil rainforest,amazon rainforest deforestaton,amazon rain forest,amazonian tribe,brazil	25	News & Politics	PT10M49S	649	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5iNuFN7L4-g/maxresdefault.jpg	1	5837	130	9	0	22

Jair Bolsonaro took power in Brazil in October 2018. Since that time he has waged a relentless war on one of the most delicate and essential ecosystems on the planet. The damage is now so severe and irreversible that the majority of the Amazon may well be nothing more than dry savannah land within 3 decades. This video looks at the scale of the challenge and what can be done.
