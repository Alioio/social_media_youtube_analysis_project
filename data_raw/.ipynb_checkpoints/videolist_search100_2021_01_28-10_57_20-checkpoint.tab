Living ecosystems like forests, mangroves, swamps and seabeds can pull enormous quantities of carbon from the air and store them safely, but natural climate solutions currently receive only 2% of the funding spent on cutting emissions. The film’s director, Tom Mustill of Gripping Films, said: 'We tried to make the film have the tiniest environmental impact possible. We took trains to Sweden to interview Greta, charged our hybrid car at George’s house, used green energy to power the edit and recycled archive footage rather than shooting new.'

(Subscribe: https://bit.ly/C4_News_Subscribe) Thunberg told the crowd that the world's rapidly declining carbon budgets would be gone within eight years based on current emission levels. "How do you respond to the fact that basically nothing is being done about this without feeling the slightest bit of anger? And how do you communicate this without sounding alarmist?

"You have stolen my childhood and my dreams with your empty words," Thunberg said at the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York. "You're failing us, but young people are starting to understand your betrayal. The eyes of all future generations are upon you. And if you choose to fail us, I say we will never forgive you," she added. Thunberg traveled to the U.S. by sailboat last month so she could appear at the summit. She and other youth activists led international climate strikes on Friday in an attempt to garner awareness ahead of the UN's meeting of political and business leaders.

The difference was so drastic in her opinion that she decided to take matters into her own hands. Greta is a 15-year-old Stockholm native who lives at home with her parents and sister Beata. She’s a 9th grader in Stockholm who enjoys spending her spare time riding Icelandic horses, spending time with her families two dogs, Moses and Roxy. She love animals and has a passion for books and science. At a young age, she became interested in the environment and convinced her family to adopt a sustainable lifestyle. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

I am 15 years old. I am from Sweden. I speak on behalf of Climate Justice Now. Many people say that Sweden is just a small country and it doesn't matter what we do. But I've learned you are never too small to make a difference. And if a few children can get headlines all over the world just by not going to school, then imagine what we could all do together if we really wanted to. But to do that, we have to speak clearly, no matter how uncomfortable that may be. You only speak of green eternal economic growth because you are too scared of being unpopular. You only talk about moving forward with the same bad ideas that got us into this mess, even when the only sensible thing to do is pull the emergency brake. You are not mature enough to tell it like is. Even that burden you leave to us children. But I don't care about being popular. I care about climate justice and the living planet. Our civilization is being sacrificed for the opportunity of a very small number of people to continue making enormous amounts of money. Our biosphere is being sacrificed so that rich people in countries like mine can live in luxury. It is the sufferings of the many which pay for the luxuries of the few. The year 2078, I will celebrate my 75th birthday. If I have children maybe they will spend that day with me. Maybe they will ask me about you. Maybe they will ask why you didn't do anything while there still was time to act. You say you love your children above all else, and yet you are stealing their future in front of their very eyes. Until you start focusing on what needs to be done rather than what is politically possible, there is no hope. We cannot solve a crisis without treating it as a crisis. We need to keep the fossil fuels in the ground, and we need to focus on equity. And if solutions within the system are so impossible to find, maybe we should change the system itself. We have not come here to beg world leaders to care. You have ignored us in the past and you will ignore us again. We have run out of excuses and we are running out of time. We have come here to let you know that change is coming, whether you like it or not. The real power belongs to the people. Thank you." #SchoolStrike4Climate #ClimateStrike #Youth4Climate #YouthUnstoppable #FridaysForFuture	connect4climate,C4C,climate,climate change,community,World Bank,World Bank Group,awareness,movement,global warming,youth,Greta,Greta Thunberg,Climate Strike,Climate Action,COP24,UNFCCC,SchoolStrike4Climate,#SchoolStrike4Climate,#ClimateStrike,School Strike,Fridays for Future,greta first speech,greta speech,greta thunberg speech,greta cop24,greta speech poland,greta climate	29	Nonprofits & Activism	PT3M30S	210	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VFkQSGyeCWg/maxresdefault.jpg		1960207	25647	5816	0

In August 2018, dismayed by adults’ lack of action on the global climate crisis, the teenager sat herself down in front of the Swedish Parliament, pledging to strike from school every Friday until Sweden aligned its policies with the Paris Agreement. Greta’s actions have earned her a Nobel Peace Prize nomination and speaking engagements at the World Economic Forum and COP24—but most importantly, they’ve encouraged students from all over the globe to stand up for Earth and their futures.

Global emissions are reaching record levels and show no sign of peaking. The last four years were the four hottest on record, and winter temperatures in the Arctic have risen by 3°C since 1990. Sea levels are rising, coral reefs are dying, and we are starting to see the life-threatening impact of climate change on health, through air pollution, heatwaves and risks to food security. The impacts of climate change are being felt everywhere and are having very real consequences on people’s lives. Climate change is disrupting national economies, costing us dearly today and even more tomorrow. But there is a growing recognition that affordable, scalable solutions are available now that will enable us all to leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies. The latest analysis shows that if we act now, we can reduce carbon emissions within 12 years and hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C and even, as asked by the latest science, to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. Thankfully, we have the Paris Agreement – a visionary, viable, forward-looking policy framework that sets out exactly what needs to be done to stop climate disruption and reverse its impact. But the agreement itself is meaningless without ambitious action. UN Secretary-General António Guterres is calling on all leaders to come to New York on 23 September with concrete, realistic plans to enhance their nationally determined contributions by 2020, in line with reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 45 per cent over the next decade, and to net zero emissions by 2050.	dpiavl,english,global issues,topics/issues,cas,cas2019,climate change,6088742229001	25	News & Politics	PT4M8S	248	2d	sd	false			1209731	10917	11665	0	4266

Public schools throughout the city even let kids skip class to join the cause. More: Thousands of people took to New York City streets Friday to help fight climate change, joining worldwide demonstrations ahead of a U.N. summit. Public schools throughout the city even let kids skip class to join the cause. With home-made signs, some which read "The Earth. Is. Not. Expendable (Period)," "¡PUERTO RICO SE LEVANTA!" and "WE ARE MISSING OUR LESSONS SO WE CAN YEACH YOU ONE," the enthusiastic crowd flooded the Big Apple in hopes of having their message heard. The sea of young people, including Swedish activist Greta Thurnberg and two of the 21 young plaintiffs who filed a constitutional climate lawsuit against the U.S. government, among other climate activists, took over the streets, assembling at Foley Square to march to Battery Park for a rally. The flood of people marching in New York City, holding signs as they chanted, mirrored similar rallies across the globe. Activists are calling for immediate action from the world's governments to halt global warming, reduce fossil fuel consumption and avert environmental catastrophe. Thunberg says that rather than listen to her and other young activists, lawmakers should invite scientists to the Capitol to listen to their expertise on ways to slow a rise in global temperatures, Thunberg said. "This is not about us. This is not about youth activism," she said. "We don't want to be heard. We want the science to be heard."

Becoming an adult in Swedish comes with a lot of freedoms, including the right to vote and stand for office. And that's important to Thunberg who has often said "Every election is a climate election." The world got to know her as a 15 year old. Sitting outside the Swedish parliament, protesting for action on climate change. With her slogan 'school strike for the climate' Thunberg invited her classmates to join her and skip school on Fridays to protest. Her message went viral - and global. She repeatedly scolded world leaders’ reactions to global warming. Ultimately her protest inspired the 'Friday's for future' demonstrations - which gained major traction with young people around the world. But the movement also hit home with a lot of older people - people concerned that they had seen too little climate action in their lifetimes. Her message was clear and simple. ln 2019 the environmental activist sailed two weeks across the Atlantic on a zero carbon yacht to New York to deliver a message to the UN's climate action summit. There, she reminded the world that she was still just a child and her thoughts should be elsewhere. But now Thunberg is turning 18 - making her an adult in the eyes of Swedish law. She will finally be able to vote and hold to account politicians she accuses of passing the climate buck onto children. She says for her nothing has changed, the world needs to treat climate change as the true crisis it is - here and now.

What started as a one person strike soon gained global momentum. In 'Make The World Greta Again', we follow Greta and the organizers of the school strikes for climate as they are cementing a worldwide movement ahead of their first global protest that took place on March 15th, 2019. It was the biggest climate strike in history with up to 1.6 million students in more than 125 countries.

The 16-year-old warned the more than 60 presidents and prime ministers gathered in the General Assembly hall for the summit that the youth would not let them “get away with this.” She said they draw the line here and now and “change is coming,” whether they like it or not. ––––––––– LINK: https://www.voanews.com/usa/teen-climate-activist-thunberg-scolds-leaders-inaction	Greta,Thunberg,Climate,Change,Summit,United,Nations,Speech,Autism,Activism,Activist,Global,Warming	25	News & Politics	PT1M33S	93	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-Gq5Gk_qZqg/maxresdefault.jpg		160138	1096	3199	0	1509

Thunberg, Luisa Neubauer from Germany and Belgians Anuna de Wever van der Heyden and Adélaïde Charlier arrived at the chancellery for a 90-minute meeting Thursday, the first high-profile talks the youth activists have held with a world leader since the start of the pandemic. The coronavirus outbreak has prevented the Fridays for Future movement that Thunberg inspired from holding its mass rallies in recent months. The activists argue that governments around the world are doing too little to curb emissions of greenhouse gases that are heating up the atmosphere. In a letter sent to world leaders last month, they called for numerous measures including ending financing for oil and gas projects, including all forms of man-made emissions in reduction targets and setting binding carbon budgets. Germany currently holds the six-month rotating presidency of the European Union. Merkel has in the past lauded the youth activists for putting pressure on politicians to act against global warming.

Reviewed by Chryssa Rapessi. In this passionate call to action, 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg explains why, in August 2018, she walked out of school and organized a strike to raise awareness of global warming, protesting outside the Swedish parliament and grabbing the world's attention. "The climate crisis has already been solved. We already have all the facts and solutions," Thunberg says. "All we have to do is to wake up and change."

She ended off her speech with a message: "This is what I want you to focus on. So, please tell me how do you react to these numbers without feeling at least some level of panic? How do you respond to the fact that basically nothing is being done about this without feeling the slightest bit of anger? And how do you communicate this without sounding alarmist?

Many people (like 5!) asked me about my views on climate change so here it is! The video can be pretty tedious if climate change isn’t a topic you are interested in in the first place, but I felt that climate change is such a complicated topic that without a long ass video I can’t really properly explain my disdain for Greta Thunberg’s speech. Yes I know she’s a teen and she’s autistic but it doesn’t change the fact that she’s preaching a dangerous message that will have serious negative economic impact, especially on the poor and for poorer countries. If you can’t be bothered to watch the entire video, here is the TDLR: The climate crisis cannot be solved simply blaming people for their greed. Everything comes at a cost and the current climate situation is the price to pay for the peace and prosperity that we all enjoy. Everyone is to blame. To implicate change comes with cost, which doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try to improve the current climate situation, but people should be made aware of the cost first.

The event near the Colorado state Capitol will include a panel of youth activists and end with a “die-in” that organizers say will symbolize those people facing danger and death because of climate change. Thunberg has staged weekly “Fridays for Future” demonstrations for a year to call for faster action against climate change. She has inspired students around the world to skip classes on Fridays to demonstrate as well. The 16-year-old sailed to the U.S. in August to promote her climate change campaign. She garnered international attention when she scolded world leaders at the United Nations. She’s touring the Americas for several months, concluding with a U.N. climate conference in Chile in December.

"For too long, the people in power have gotten away with basically not doing anything to stop the climate and ecological breakdown. They have gotten away with stealing our future and selling it for profit. But we, young people, are waking up, and we promise we will not let you get away with it anymore," Thunberg stated. The 16-year-old was one of the main highlights of the conference that united politicians from all over the world, including UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, as well as actor and former governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger. Schwarzenegger, in turn, added, "The fact is, if we fail to act, it is their future at stake not ours, their dreams should give us hope, their vision should lead us to action", The R20 Austrian World Summit is an initiative which helps countries and cities to achieve UN Sustainable Development Goals and protect climate in accordance with the Paris Agreement.

Ms Thunberg recently attended a meeting with the European Commission as it moves to adopt a continent-wide climate law. The law would commit the EU to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. However, the environmental activist denounced the targets and accused the European Union of “pretending” to tackle climate change. "Surely the polish is beginning to wear off?" Ms Tognini told Sky News host Andrew Bolt "There's nothing wrong with educated young people having a voice in debate, in fact we should be encouraging educated young people to be engaged". However, "Greta Thunberg is reading from the same prepared script, there's no facts, it's all emotion, it's all empty words". Ms Tognini said promoting environmental activist Greta Thunberg "at every opportunity" to discuss climate change and pollution is actually "a tremendous own goal" for the cause.

On that issue, two very different messages from U.S. President Donald Trump and Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg. Our Park Hee-jun has more. Two of the most high-profile attendees at the World Economic Forum in Davos ensured it was impossible to miss the annual meeting. U.S. President Donald Trump and teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg,... carried on their indirect debate on climate change. In his keynote speech on Tuesday, local time,... President Trump revealed that the U.S. will join the initiative to plant one trillion trees. "Today, I'm pleased to announce the United States will join one trillion trees initiative being launched here at the World Economic Forum. One trillion trees." While this year's forum is focused on how businesses must change to save the planet,... President Trump's more than 30-minute long speech was devoted to highlighting the importance of the oil and gas industries,... with promises on climate change nowhere to be found. Instead, he warned against listening to the "prophets of doom." "This is not a time for pessimism. This is a time for optimism. Fear and doubt is not a good thought process because this is a time for tremendous hope and joy and optimism in action. But to embrace the possibilities of tomorrow, we must reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse." Sitting in the audience for the speech was Thunberg. Speaking shortly after President Trump's special address, the Swedish activist took aim at Trump and other world leaders, accusing them of doing nothing and making empty promises on climate change. "You say children shouldn't worry. You say just leave this to us. We will fix this. We promise we won't let you down. Don't be so pessimistic. And then, nothing. Silence. Or something worse than silence. Empty words and promises which give the impression that sufficient action is being taken." She also criticized the lack of action to reduce carbon emissions when the world is in her words "on fire". "I wonder what will you tell your children was the reason to fail and leave them facing a climate chaos that you knowingly brought upon them? That it seemed so bad for the economy that we decided to resign the idea of securing future living conditions, without even trying? Our house is still on fire. Your inaction is fuelling the flames by the hour." Their mutual dislike of each other has been in the spotlight since last year. Their last encounter was at the UN last September. Photos and videos of Thunberg glaring at President Trump as he passed by after the climate change summit went viral at the time. It was followed by a tweet by the American leader, saying Thunberg should work on her anger management issues.

U.S. President Donald Trump and Swedish teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg had two very different messages to give over climate change. Our Park Hee-jun has more. Two of the most high-profile attendees at the World Economic Forum in Davos ensured it was impossible to miss the annual meeting. U.S. President Donald Trump and teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg,... carried on their indirect debate on climate change. In his keynote speech on Tuesday, local time,... President Trump revealed that the U.S. will join the initiative to plant one trillion trees. "Today, I'm pleased to announce the United States will join one trillion trees initiative being launched here at the World Economic Forum. One trillion trees." While this year's forum is focused on how businesses must change to save the planet,... President Trump's more than 30-minute long speech was devoted to highlighting the importance of the oil and gas industries,... with promises on climate change nowhere to be found. Instead, he warned against listening to the "prophets of doom." "This is not a time for pessimism. This is a time for optimism. Fear and doubt is not a good thought process because this is a time for tremendous hope and joy and optimism in action. But to embrace the possibilities of tomorrow, we must reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse." Sitting in the audience for the speech was Thunberg. Speaking shortly after President Trump's special address, the Swedish activist took aim at Trump and other world leaders, accusing them of doing nothing and making empty promises on climate change. "You say children shouldn't worry. You say just leave this to us. We will fix this. We promise we won't let you down. Don't be so pessimistic. And then, nothing. Silence. Or something worse than silence. Empty words and promises which give the impression that sufficient action is being taken." She also criticized the lack of action to reduce carbon emissions when the world is in her words "on fire". "I wonder what will you tell your children was the reason to fail and leave them facing a climate chaos that you knowingly brought upon them? That it seemed so bad for the economy that we decided to resign the idea of securing future living conditions, without even trying? Our house is still on fire. Your inaction is fuelling the flames by the hour." Their mutual dislike of each other has been in the spotlight since last year. Their last encounter was at the UN last September. Photos and videos of Thunberg glaring at President Trump as he passed by after the climate change summit went viral at the time. It was followed by a tweet by the American leader, saying Thunberg should work on her anger management issues.
