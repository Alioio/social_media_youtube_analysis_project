Many people think that the cause of climate change is carbon dioxide, and reducing carbon dioxide can prevent climate change.
This is a bit convincing, but not correct.
The exact cause of climate change is ""thermal excess"" on the earth.
Therefore, to stop climate change, we must focus on stopping of the ""thermal excess"".

""GREEN NEW DEAL"" has good intentions. However, there are several problems. 
The biggest problem is that it is less economical. It means that it is difficult for many people to actively participate. 
Therefore, coercion must be mobilized to achieve the desired goal, and excessive coercion hinders the achievement of the goal. 
This is a fundamental problem.
Also, waste is another problem. 
Waste solar cells and waste blades are discharged, and the waste batteries of ESS adversely affect the environment.

Although there is a problem with the need for large land, the best way to reduce heat and carbon dioxide is to create big forests.
Trump should publicize the effects of ""One trillion trees"" to others and urge the world to join in and work together.

Why is ""One trillion trees"" so effective?
First of all, it is economical. Compared to solar power generation and wind power generation, it does not require a lot of funds at the beginning. 
forests has a long lifespan, and does not require additional facilities such as ESS and power transmission and distribution facilities, and does not emit waste.

In addition, One trillion trees absorb enormous amounts of solar heat.
Photosynthesis requires infrared rays from the sun.
It absorbs infrared rays (heat rays) and ultraviolet rays to perform photosynthesis, turning carbon dioxide into oxygen and making glucose.
One trillion trees absorbing solar heat is very good at slowing down climate change. 
The reason people don't really care about trees absorbing heat is that they don't think the cause of global warming is fundamentally ""overheating,"" but rather carbon dioxide.

climate change, in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate
poverty, including by:
(a) Holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below
2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature
increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would
significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change; 

(b) Increasing the ability to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate
change and foster climate resilience and low greenhouse gas emissions
development, in a manner that does not threaten food production; and
(c) Making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low
greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development.

This is false because, first, 95 percent of the greenhouse gas effect in Earth's atmosphere is caused by water vapor. 1/3rd of the remaining 5 percent is CO2 gas. 3 percent of this is man's total contribution since 1850 accounting for an estimated 0.1 percent of the greenhouse gas effect.

Second, 95 percent of the narrow band of infrared radiation available for CO2 to emmit is doing so already. So doubling CO2 would make no measurable difference.

Third, changes in the appearance of atmospheric CO2 gas occur at least 800 years AFTER changes in temperature. CO2 is an effect, not a cause.

Since the peak of the Little Ice Age 350 years ago, the global mean surface temperature has been rising at a rate of 0.8C/century and, to this day, hasn't deviated by more than 1.5 percent from the mean.

Assume I am driving car for 10 hours continuously without any break with different speed. So first 7 hours, I drive at varying speeds not exceeding 50 miles/hr and then in last 3 hours, I increase my speed by 1.5 times after each hour. 
So, assume I am at 50 miles/hr at end of 7 hours. So after eighth hour, I am at (50*1.5=75 miles/hr) and after ninth hour, I am at (75*1.5=112.5 miles/hr) and finally at the end of tenth hour, my speed is (112.5*1.5=168.75 miles/hr).

So as per your logic, I will say my increase in speed per hour was: (168.75 - 0.0)/10 = 16.875 miles/hour. BUT THAT IS WRONG.

In reality, I was slow and did not exceed 50 miles/hr for first 7 hours and then I ACCELERATED ONLY IN LAST 3 HOURS. 

So my average increase in speed per hour WILL GIVE ME FALSE IMPRESSION THAT I DID NOT ACCELERATE IN THE END AND 16.875 miles/hr is pretty decent increase in speed for 10 hour journey.  

By the way, I am not alarmist. Climate change is not like one day you get up and we all die. Climate change affects subtly. For example, in coming years, there will be increased number of floods, droughts, frequent and stronger hurricanes and so on.  I never meant to say that climate change will hit you suddenly like a nuclear bomb. It is slow and continuously damaging in several ways. Not to mention that agriculture will suffer a lot due to seasonal variations.

Already in the second sentence is a mistake. Carbon is not equal carbondioxide. Or would you say hydrogen is equal to water?  It is therefore also overly stupid to measure a gas in tons. Real scientists measure CO2 in the atmosphere in ppm.
In order to explain warming by CO2 they invented the theory the radiative forcing. But there is the same problem with it, like with unicorns. Everybody knows how to describe it, but nobody has ever seen one.
Besides, there is another mistery. The CO2 is still increasing, despite half of the world is in corona lockdown since 6 months.

Look you seem like an intelligent person, I appreciate the animal rights aren't going to do it but I suggest you look into all the different areas where animal agriculture is causing harm. Once (if) you change then you wont need cognitive dissonance or an appeal to futility, and once that's out of the way you may see the true injustice and unnecessary suffering we cause to these animals. Question, do you have a dog or cat? maybe I can use pets as an example? 
But basically you don't need to love animals to be vegan, just recognise that their life is worth more than your momentary sensory pleasure. I mean given the choice to slit a cows throat yourself for a burger or eat a vegan curry I'm sure I know which one you would honestly choose.

In terms of the gun analogy... its better. However you are talking to the wrong person because I live in Portugal and no one here has guns. No one in Europe has guns. In fact its crazy to people here that that's actually allowed in the US. Aren't there many people against gun ownership though? I mean I'm sure there's many people without guns, and from what i'm seeing there's more pressure than ever to get rid of guns right? The government won't do it unless there's social pressure but that day may very well come... and in my opinion the US will be much better off... So it kind of applies to the vegan thing.",0.0,1.0,,k1oPVp63eNk,

Most likely, I suspect, there are some people who are suggestible to veganism, they need encouragement from others to make that jump but ultimately they were always predisposed to that sort of decision. The sort of word-of-mouth approach you suggest may reach say, ten to twenty percent of westerners, but I'm not sure that's really enough. If you really want a meat-free world, it would have to come from the top down, not the bottom up.

(I also note that you seem to have lapsed from making an environmental case at this point to being solely one over animal rights, which confirms my thoughts that you would have gone vegan anyway and the environmental factors are simply a side issue. Personally, I'm not too fussed over animal rights, it's just never been a high priority for me, humans are simply doing a more sophisticated version of what every apex predator before them did. This is obviously something we aren't ever going to agree on, because it is a fundamental difference in values.)

In terms of the teaching analogy, yes, I understand it is flawed. I'll give you that one. How about a better analogy - gun control in the US. Yes, gun owners could be more responsible. They could even decide to get rid of their guns voluntarily. But they just aren't going to. Whenever there is a mass shooting in the US, people blame the easy availability of lethal weapons - and they are completely right to look at government inaction rather than the individual perpetrator. I believe meat consumption (to the extent that it is polluting in a way that affects humans) is in a similar category to gun ownership.",0.0,1.0,,k1oPVp63eNk,

In order to change government (which i think is something we should do obviously) you need a large enough following. Every individual counts.  The teacher example doesnt work because you are not directly sabotaging the educational system, are you? where as by eating meat you are directly causing harm. A better example:

Every teacher uses violence on kids and it's normalised in society, you want to change the system so teachers don't hit kids whilst you are currently beating a child.

Using an inexpensive thermoelectric device, they’re able to harness the cold of space without an active heat input. The process, called radiative sky cooling, can generate enough electricity to power an LED light. Think of it as similar to solar panels, except using the change in the night temperature for power rather than the sun.

We have until 2030 to end fossil emissions entirely.

It's also better than the video implies. Lynchpin nations punch above their weight contributing to fossil emissions through export, import and trade. Get these handful of nations to scale back to zero fossil emissions and fossil trade and they can reduce world fossil emissions in half, and they can do it unilaterally. More, they can start a virtuous cycle of swapping fossil for renewable as the technology improves and fossil free prices come down through economies of scale.


Start with Canada, responsible for 14% of global fossil emissions despite its tiny 1.6% of domestic direct emissions; get rid of Canada's bitumen extraction, and 7% of the world's fossil emissions disappear. Will other suppliers step in to fill the void of the world's 4th largest fossil exporter? They may, but they'll drive the price up as supplies are constrained 5%, taking the world back to 2015 prices. 2015 oil prices can't compete with 2021 solar prices, or wind or geothermal; conventional 2015 cars can't compete with 2021 electric vehicles. For the rest, Canada needs to stop exporting coal, which will also end US coal exports as US ports won't handle the stuff, and Canada is only obliged to ship American coal if it ships Canadian coal. That leaves Canada's fossil-intensive imports, which it can over the next decade drop to zero; Canada's already 82% fossil free on its electricity grids and has plenty of expertise for Hybrit steel and Elysis aluminum, basalt fiber, geopolymer cement, even biochar production to displace carbon in silicon fabrication.

Move to Australia, infamous for its coal exports. Anything Canada can do, Australia can do standing on its head.

Go through the list of key fossil emission contributors and you'll find more than enough muscle in just a few nations -- enough to skip over the usual suspects like Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, the USA, Russia, China and India -- and get it done.

Cap relative to 2019 levels fossil emitting trade and extraction at 90% in 2021, 80% in 2022, 70% in 2023 down to 0% in 2030 and the Market will rush to invest in fossil free innovation. Lead the target to hit the target.

There's no action, just laziness, I wouldn't say on the part of the speakers, but of the platform itself. It also represents a certain attitude towards the issues on our planet, an attitude that says we can solve it all by talking about it and spreading our ideas. Unfortunately, that is much too slow to respond and adapt to this never-ending technological revolution. It's kind of like a rich person's pastime, where we all talk about how we're so much more advanced and our ideas are amazing, yet when it comes to it, all that it is is a pastime. It's much more comfortable to sit in a chair and listen to someone speak, then to go out and commit your entire life to the fixing of our world. That, however, is exactly what we need in order to win in the battle against ourselves. Then again, I suppose TED is pretty much powerless to do anything... well... you could talk about controversial subjects that will end up angering either the US, China, Russia, or the EU, but we all know that will never happen. Everyone's stuck in this seemingly endless cycle, one where we're arguing for the sake of arguing, following rules that we didn't have a hand in creating, rules that evolution instinctually gave to us. But we never question them. Society tells us to jump and we do so without any notion of doing otherwise. Honestly, climate change isn't an issue. What we really need to change is how we view life itself. For there is no reason to covet wealth or power but the words of those with wealth and power. Why haven't we stopped to think for once, and realized that all those in power want you to do is to work for them. There no benefits for yourself but a life slaving away for someone who views you as a number on a page. Go against the grain, stop listening to the rich people telling you what to think, what to learn, and what to do. If you want to live a good life it really is as simple(yet difficult) as that.

I'm not just repeating propaganda, I'm taking about science, which is what you're also doing - if you say everything I say is commie propaganda, whilst taking everything you read that supports your argument as proof, then there's not point us talking.

In my last comment I meant pollutants which are green house gases - with CO2 being the main one, although there are also others, sorry for not clarifying that. The Scotese + Berner studies are used quite a lot in climate denialism, but they simplify climate science. We know that things were different in the past and in the paleozoic era the solar output was a lot lower, so the high CO2 levels helped the planet maintain a stable climate. Our planet is really good at regulating the climate to make life possible, the problem now is the unprecedented rate at which humans are realising CO2, depleting albedo, resulting in exponential warming that will be the 6th mass extinction of humans and billions of other species.",0.0,1.0,,k1oPVp63eNk,

The idea that we can reliably predict to the tenth of a degree what the temperature will be in 100 years, using the current models, is simply false. The idea that we can precisely predict how large of an effect a specific policy will have over 100 years, is simply false. I am not saying the models are completely wrong or that they are not useful.

Let's say you have two haulage firms, A and B. A has ten times as many lorries as B, it has ten times the turnover and makes ten times the profit. Its lorry fleet covers ten times the distance of B's, so it's also using ten times as much carbon as B, and it would have to pay ten times as much in carbon taxes - the same proportion of its profits.

First and foremost, that'd be overpopulation, which leads to excess deforestation. Then the most obvious one is industrialization. The next one would be more and more people buying private vehicles which wasn't the case, say about 100 years back. So I don't think you would argue with THAT. Vehicle exhaust is one of the top reasons of poor quality air in developing and developed countries. All of these factors add up and that leads to dramatic CO2 rise. And these are ALL anthropogenic (man made) factors. There's that about rising CO2 level.
Now about *why* ? Its just basic chemistry. The molecules of greenhouse gases have very good heat trapping capabilities. G.g. molecules can absorb energy from infrared (IR) radiations, basically photons(packets of energy) & energy from the photon causes the CO2 molecule to vibrate. Some time later, the molecule gives up this extra energy by emitting another infrared photon. Once the extra energy has been removed by the emitted photon, the carbon dioxide molecule stops vibrating. Molecules are constantly in motion, colliding with other gas molecules and transferring energy from one molecule to another during collisions. In the more-complex, real-world process, a CO2 molecule would most likely bump into several other gas molecules before re-emitting the infrared photon. The CO2 molecule might transfer the energy it gained from the absorbed photon to another molecule, adding speed to that molecule's motion. Since the temperature of a gas is a measure of the speed of the molecules in the gas, the faster motion of a molecule that eventually results from the IR photon that was absorbed by a CO2 molecule raises the temperature of the gases in the atmosphere.

This ability to absorb and re-emit infrared energy is what makes CO2 an effective heat-trapping greenhouse gas. Not all gas molecules are able to absorb IR radiation. For example, nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2), which make up more than 90% of Earth's atmosphere, do not absorb infrared photons. CO2 molecules can vibrate in ways that simpler nitrogen and oxygen molecules cannot, which allows CO2 molecules to capture the IR photons. Greenhouse gases and the greenhouse effect play an important role in Earth's climate. Without greenhouse gases, our planet would be a frozen ball of ice. In recent years, however, excess emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from human activities (mostly burning fossil fuels) have begun to warm Earth's climate at a problematic rate. Other significant greenhouse gases include water vapor (H2O), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and ozone (O3).

It's a heavy handed opinion video which cherry picks and then proceeds to misrepresent data. There's not even a whole lot to argue against there. It's just deceptive and surface level, and I think anyone who isn't trying to just reaffirm their opinions would see that.

Also, what point in our Earth's past? Our Eart has gone through several climate cycles, all of which had an underlying cause, such as atmospheric composition, mind you. There were points in time when dinosaurs roamed the Earth where, yes average CO2 was higher (not sure about ten times higher but whatever), but so was average global temperatures and sea levels.

What weather events? Hurricanes, tropical storms, wildfires, volcanic activity? You gotta specify. Regardless, the climate doesn't stop certain things from happening. The most severe hurricane could've happened ten thousand years ago but that wouldn't change anything. It's the increase in average severity that matters.

As far as your last remark, I really don't understand what you mean by any of that. Genuine question, is English your native language? No insult there if it's not. You're doing a good enough job at speaking it that I have to ask, and I can only speak one language, so good on you. However, there are some confusing word choices and grammatical and structural decisions here and there that are making things a bit harder to understand at times.

Though, quite frankly, I'm not sure I'm too interested in keeping engaged with this. There isn't much of a discussion happening here, if I'm being brutally honest. I say things, you shrug them off and reply with loosely related things that either aren't really arguments or are based off of bad data, like a YouTube video that wouldn't hold up to any sort of scientific scrutiny, or subjective perceptions and morals, or both. I'm trying my best here to keep an open mind in the exchange of knowledge and ideas, but it seems you're more interested in being right or ""pwning the climate commies"" or whatever then trying to enhance your understanding of a topic while sharpening your mind.

Many people think that the cause of climate change is carbon dioxide, and reducing carbon dioxide can prevent climate change.
This is a bit convincing, but not correct.
The exact cause of climate change is ""thermal excess"" on the earth.
Therefore, to stop climate change, we must focus on stopping of the ""thermal excess"".

""GREEN NEW DEAL"" has good intentions. However, there are several problems. 
The biggest problem is that it is less economical. It means that it is difficult for many people to actively participate. 
Therefore, coercion must be mobilized to achieve the desired goal, and excessive coercion hinders the achievement of the goal. 
This is a fundamental problem.
Also, waste is another problem. 
Waste solar cells and waste blades are discharged, and the waste batteries of ESS adversely affect the environment.

Although there is a problem with the need for large land, the best way to reduce heat and carbon dioxide is to create big forests.
Trump should publicize the effects of ""One trillion trees"" to others and urge the world to join in and work together.

Why is ""One trillion trees"" so effective?
First of all, it is economical. Compared to solar power generation and wind power generation, it does not require a lot of funds at the beginning. 
forests has a long lifespan, and does not require additional facilities such as ESS and power transmission and distribution facilities, and does not emit waste.

In addition, One trillion trees absorb enormous amounts of solar heat.
Photosynthesis requires infrared rays from the sun.
It absorbs infrared rays (heat rays) and ultraviolet rays to perform photosynthesis, turning carbon dioxide into oxygen and making glucose.
One trillion trees absorbing solar heat is very good at slowing down climate change. 
The reason people don't really care about trees absorbing heat is that they don't think the cause of global warming is fundamentally ""overheating,"" but rather carbon dioxide.

This is false because, first, 95 percent of the greenhouse gas effect in Earth's atmosphere is caused by water vapor. 1/3rd of the remaining 5 percent is CO2 gas. 3 percent of this is man's total contribution since 1850 accounting for an estimated 0.1 percent of the greenhouse gas effect.

Second, 95 percent of the narrow band of infrared radiation available for CO2 to emmit is doing so already. So doubling CO2 would make no measurable difference.

Third, changes in the appearance of atmospheric CO2 gas occur at least 800 years AFTER changes in temperature. CO2 is an effect, not a cause.

Since the peak of the Little Ice Age 350 years ago, the global mean surface temperature has been rising at a rate of 0.8C/century and, to this day, hasn't deviated by more than 1.5 percent from the mean.

Assume I am driving car for 10 hours continuously without any break with different speed. So first 7 hours, I drive at varying speeds not exceeding 50 miles/hr and then in last 3 hours, I increase my speed by 1.5 times after each hour. 
So, assume I am at 50 miles/hr at end of 7 hours. So after eighth hour, I am at (50*1.5=75 miles/hr) and after ninth hour, I am at (75*1.5=112.5 miles/hr) and finally at the end of tenth hour, my speed is (112.5*1.5=168.75 miles/hr).

So as per your logic, I will say my increase in speed per hour was: (168.75 - 0.0)/10 = 16.875 miles/hour. BUT THAT IS WRONG.

In reality, I was slow and did not exceed 50 miles/hr for first 7 hours and then I ACCELERATED ONLY IN LAST 3 HOURS. 

So my average increase in speed per hour WILL GIVE ME FALSE IMPRESSION THAT I DID NOT ACCELERATE IN THE END AND 16.875 miles/hr is pretty decent increase in speed for 10 hour journey.  

By the way, I am not alarmist. Climate change is not like one day you get up and we all die. Climate change affects subtly. For example, in coming years, there will be increased number of floods, droughts, frequent and stronger hurricanes and so on.  I never meant to say that climate change will hit you suddenly like a nuclear bomb. It is slow and continuously damaging in several ways. Not to mention that agriculture will suffer a lot due to seasonal variations.

It looks like they may have focused too much on one single metric like CO2 emissions per capita, ranked counties by that metric and reported that as the be all end all for climate involvement. In particular mentioning India as a near successful country sounds very misleading to me. Compared to counties of it's size like China and the US it's CO2 emissions per capita might be very low due to India's large population yet relative poverty compared to the US, but their CO2 emissions have been steadily increasing and still nearly 60% of India's energy comes from coal. Considering India's current economical situation it does not look like it is set up to slow down let alone reverse it's carbon emissions any time soon.

Instead of putting all your faith into a snapshot of one single metric, take a look at what's been happening over the last decade or two. Then counties like Norway - with their focus on solar and hydro power - and France - with their impressive focus on nuclear power - show that they have reduced and are capable of further reducing their emissions.",0.0,0.0,,k1oPVp63eNk,

Already in the second sentence is a mistake. Carbon is not equal carbondioxide. Or would you say hydrogen is equal to water?  It is therefore also overly stupid to measure a gas in tons. Real scientists measure CO2 in the atmosphere in ppm.
In order to explain warming by CO2 they invented the theory the radiative forcing. But there is the same problem with it, like with unicorns. Everybody knows how to describe it, but nobody has ever seen one.
Besides, there is another mistery. The CO2 is still increasing, despite half of the world is in corona lockdown since 6 months.

Vegan companies are thriving and the milk industry would be dead already if not for the substantial subsidies they receive from government... Meat would also be very expensive if they weren't heavily subsidised. You're right in the sense that some people will never go vegan willingly, but social pressure will definitely do it... and if not then at some point down the line laws will do it. The world is much better off without animal agriculture, for many reasons other than animal rights, many human rights issues too... it's all bunched together for me now, though initially i changed due to environmental issues. 

Look you seem like an intelligent person, I appreciate the animal rights aren't going to do it but I suggest you look into all the different areas where animal agriculture is causing harm. Once (if) you change then you wont need cognitive dissonance or an appeal to futility, and once that's out of the way you may see the true injustice and unnecessary suffering we cause to these animals. Question, do you have a dog or cat? maybe I can use pets as an example? 
But basically you don't need to love animals to be vegan, just recognise that their life is worth more than your momentary sensory pleasure. I mean given the choice to slit a cows throat yourself for a burger or eat a vegan curry I'm sure I know which one you would honestly choose.

In terms of the gun analogy... its better. However you are talking to the wrong person because I live in Portugal and no one here has guns. No one in Europe has guns. In fact its crazy to people here that that's actually allowed in the US. Aren't there many people against gun ownership though? I mean I'm sure there's many people without guns, and from what i'm seeing there's more pressure than ever to get rid of guns right? The government won't do it unless there's social pressure but that day may very well come... and in my opinion the US will be much better off...

Most likely, I suspect, there are some people who are suggestible to veganism, they need encouragement from others to make that jump but ultimately they were always predisposed to that sort of decision. The sort of word-of-mouth approach you suggest may reach say, ten to twenty percent of westerners, but I'm not sure that's really enough. If you really want a meat-free world, it would have to come from the top down, not the bottom up.

(I also note that you seem to have lapsed from making an environmental case at this point to being solely one over animal rights, which confirms my thoughts that you would have gone vegan anyway and the environmental factors are simply a side issue. Personally, I'm not too fussed over animal rights, it's just never been a high priority for me, humans are simply doing a more sophisticated version of what every apex predator before them did. This is obviously something we aren't ever going to agree on, because it is a fundamental difference in values.)

In terms of the teaching analogy, yes, I understand it is flawed. I'll give you that one. How about a better analogy - gun control in the US. Yes, gun owners could be more responsible. They could even decide to get rid of their guns voluntarily. But they just aren't going to. Whenever there is a mass shooting in the US, people blame the easy availability of lethal weapons - and they are completely right to look at government inaction rather than the individual perpetrator. I believe meat consumption (to the extent that it is polluting in a way that affects humans) is in a similar category to gun ownership.",0.0,1.0,,k1oPVp63eNk,

In order to change government (which i think is something we should do obviously) you need a large enough following. Every individual counts.  The teacher example doesnt work because you are not directly sabotaging the educational system, are you? where as by eating meat you are directly causing harm. A better example:

Every teacher uses violence on kids and it's normalised in society, you want to change the system so teachers don't hit kids whilst you are currently beating a child.

Using an inexpensive thermoelectric device, they’re able to harness the cold of space without an active heat input. The process, called radiative sky cooling, can generate enough electricity to power an LED light. Think of it as similar to solar panels, except using the change in the night temperature for power rather than the sun.

The sun is getting hotter at a rate of about 0.5% per decade. That may not sound like a lot, but calculate it using the temperature of the sun and you'll see it's a significant amount compared to earth. This is from NASA's website and they themselves say this could cause climate change. I can't help you if you don't believe this.
https://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2003/0313irradiance.html

And both mine and your links about the windmills use math, so neither are wrong. The methods for calculating are what matter. If you expect a windmill to last 10 years it would make back it's carbon footprint, but I don't expect them to last longer than 3 years.

Your scientists have made over 43 incorrect predictions in the past 60 years, so I'll take my chances trusting the scientists who don't believe human caused climate change.

We have until 2030 to end fossil emissions entirely.

It's also better than the video implies. Lynchpin nations punch above their weight contributing to fossil emissions through export, import and trade. Get these handful of nations to scale back to zero fossil emissions and fossil trade and they can reduce world fossil emissions in half, and they can do it unilaterally. More, they can start a virtuous cycle of swapping fossil for renewable as the technology improves and fossil free prices come down through economies of scale.


Start with Canada, responsible for 14% of global fossil emissions despite its tiny 1.6% of domestic direct emissions; get rid of Canada's bitumen extraction, and 7% of the world's fossil emissions disappear. Will other suppliers step in to fill the void of the world's 4th largest fossil exporter? They may, but they'll drive the price up as supplies are constrained 5%, taking the world back to 2015 prices. 2015 oil prices can't compete with 2021 solar prices, or wind or geothermal; conventional 2015 cars can't compete with 2021 electric vehicles. For the rest, Canada needs to stop exporting coal, which will also end US coal exports as US ports won't handle the stuff, and Canada is only obliged to ship American coal if it ships Canadian coal. That leaves Canada's fossil-intensive imports, which it can over the next decade drop to zero; Canada's already 82% fossil free on its electricity grids and has plenty of expertise for Hybrit steel and Elysis aluminum, basalt fiber, geopolymer cement, even biochar production to displace carbon in silicon fabrication.

Move to Australia, infamous for its coal exports. Anything Canada can do, Australia can do standing on its head.

Go through the list of key fossil emission contributors and you'll find more than enough muscle in just a few nations -- enough to skip over the usual suspects like Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, the USA, Russia, China and India -- and get it done.

Cap relative to 2019 levels fossil emitting trade and extraction at 90% in 2021, 80% in 2022, 70% in 2023 down to 0% in 2030 and the Market will rush to invest in fossil free innovation. Lead the target to hit the target.

One of the main things is that their energy output is very low compared to their production cost. Future is not in renewable sources of energy, they are simply not enough to support our civilization on energetic level that it needs. (until you build a solar panel Dyson swarm of course :D)
But at the moment, nuclear energy is the best possible source of energy that we have in our hands. There are no emissions, much less people die in accidents compared to other kinds of plants, etc.. And if you want to mention Chernobyl, then do not forget that that was fault of the poor maintenance of the soviets. Also, there are no emissions from nuclear power plants. Only thing that you need is to store the waste and if you do not dump it into the lake or somewhere similar, then you're pretty much alright. 
And just wait for fusion, if the ITER, DEMO and PROTO experimental trial plants go well, we can wait for fusion to be our main source of power in the future, by mining helium-3 from the moon etc..",1.0,1.0,,k1oPVp63eNk,

There's no action, just laziness, I wouldn't say on the part of the speakers, but of the platform itself. It also represents a certain attitude towards the issues on our planet, an attitude that says we can solve it all by talking about it and spreading our ideas. Unfortunately, that is much too slow to respond and adapt to this never-ending technological revolution. It's kind of like a rich person's pastime, where we all talk about how we're so much more advanced and our ideas are amazing, yet when it comes to it, all that it is is a pastime. It's much more comfortable to sit in a chair and listen to someone speak, then to go out and commit your entire life to the fixing of our world. That, however, is exactly what we need in order to win in the battle against ourselves. Then again, I suppose TED is pretty much powerless to do anything... well... you could talk about controversial subjects that will end up angering either the US, China, Russia, or the EU, but we all know that will never happen. Everyone's stuck in this seemingly endless cycle, one where we're arguing for the sake of arguing, following rules that we didn't have a hand in creating, rules that evolution instinctually gave to us. But we never question them. Society tells us to jump and we do so without any notion of doing otherwise. Honestly, climate change isn't an issue. What we really need to change is how we view life itself. For there is no reason to covet wealth or power but the words of those with wealth and power. Why haven't we stopped to think for once, and realized that all those in power want you to do is to work for them. There no benefits for yourself but a life slaving away for someone who views you as a number on a page. Go against the grain, stop listening to the rich people telling you what to think, what to learn, and what to do. If you want to live a good life it really is as simple(yet difficult) as that.

All this video did was tell me that the earth has risen in temperature, but identified no exact cause or country, and that various countries agreed to try to do better, but that they aren't. Very unscientific and very boring and very terrible uninformative video.

In my last comment I meant pollutants which are green house gases - with CO2 being the main one, although there are also others, sorry for not clarifying that. The Scotese + Berner studies are used quite a lot in climate denialism, but they simplify climate science. We know that things were different in the past and in the paleozoic era the solar output was a lot lower, so the high CO2 levels helped the planet maintain a stable climate. Our planet is really good at regulating the climate to make life possible, the problem now is the unprecedented rate at which humans are realising CO2, depleting albedo, resulting in exponential warming that will be the 6th mass extinction of humans and billions of other species.",0.0,1.0,,k1oPVp63eNk,

Let's say you have two haulage firms, A and B. A has ten times as many lorries as B, it has ten times the turnover and makes ten times the profit. Its lorry fleet covers ten times the distance of B's, so it's also using ten times as much carbon as B, and it would have to pay ten times as much in carbon taxes - the same proportion of its profits.

First and foremost, that'd be overpopulation, which leads to excess deforestation. Then the most obvious one is industrialization. The next one would be more and more people buying private vehicles which wasn't the case, say about 100 years back. So I don't think you would argue with THAT. Vehicle exhaust is one of the top reasons of poor quality air in developing and developed countries. All of these factors add up and that leads to dramatic CO2 rise. And these are ALL anthropogenic (man made) factors. There's that about rising CO2 level.
Now about *why* ? Its just basic chemistry. The molecules of greenhouse gases have very good heat trapping capabilities. G.g. molecules can absorb energy from infrared (IR) radiations, basically photons(packets of energy) & energy from the photon causes the CO2 molecule to vibrate. Some time later, the molecule gives up this extra energy by emitting another infrared photon. Once the extra energy has been removed by the emitted photon, the carbon dioxide molecule stops vibrating. Molecules are constantly in motion, colliding with other gas molecules and transferring energy from one molecule to another during collisions. In the more-complex, real-world process, a CO2 molecule would most likely bump into several other gas molecules before re-emitting the infrared photon. The CO2 molecule might transfer the energy it gained from the absorbed photon to another molecule, adding speed to that molecule's motion. Since the temperature of a gas is a measure of the speed of the molecules in the gas, the faster motion of a molecule that eventually results from the IR photon that was absorbed by a CO2 molecule raises the temperature of the gases in the atmosphere.

This ability to absorb and re-emit infrared energy is what makes CO2 an effective heat-trapping greenhouse gas. Not all gas molecules are able to absorb IR radiation. For example, nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2), which make up more than 90% of Earth's atmosphere, do not absorb infrared photons. CO2 molecules can vibrate in ways that simpler nitrogen and oxygen molecules cannot, which allows CO2 molecules to capture the IR photons. Greenhouse gases and the greenhouse effect play an important role in Earth's climate. Without greenhouse gases, our planet would be a frozen ball of ice. In recent years, however, excess emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from human activities (mostly burning fossil fuels) have begun to warm Earth's climate at a problematic rate. Other significant greenhouse gases include water vapor (H2O), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and ozone (O3).

It's a heavy handed opinion video which cherry picks and then proceeds to misrepresent data. There's not even a whole lot to argue against there. It's just deceptive and surface level, and I think anyone who isn't trying to just reaffirm their opinions would see that.

Also, what point in our Earth's past? Our Eart has gone through several climate cycles, all of which had an underlying cause, such as atmospheric composition, mind you. There were points in time when dinosaurs roamed the Earth where, yes average CO2 was higher (not sure about ten times higher but whatever), but so was average global temperatures and sea levels.

What weather events? Hurricanes, tropical storms, wildfires, volcanic activity? You gotta specify. Regardless, the climate doesn't stop certain things from happening. The most severe hurricane could've happened ten thousand years ago but that wouldn't change anything. It's the increase in average severity that matters.

As far as your last remark, I really don't understand what you mean by any of that. Genuine question, is English your native language? No insult there if it's not. You're doing a good enough job at speaking it that I have to ask, and I can only speak one language, so good on you. However, there are some confusing word choices and grammatical and structural decisions here and there that are making things a bit harder to understand at times.

Though, quite frankly, I'm not sure I'm too interested in keeping engaged with this. There isn't much of a discussion happening here, if I'm being brutally honest. I say things, you shrug them off and reply with loosely related things that either aren't really arguments or are based off of bad data, like a YouTube video that wouldn't hold up to any sort of scientific scrutiny, or subjective perceptions and morals, or both. I'm trying my best here to keep an open mind in the exchange of knowledge and ideas, but it seems you're more interested in being right or ""pwning the climate commies"" or whatever then trying to enhance your understanding of a topic while sharpening your mind.

Saying carbon dioxide is a fundamental product of life, while technically true, is deceptive wording. Carbon dioxide is literally a biological waste product. You exhale to excrete it. Feces and urine are also fundamental products of life by that logic, yet I don't think you're going to argue against plumbing.

If we're gonna talk about what is and isn't natural, keep in mind that oil and coal was buried by nature before we decided to dig it up and burn it. Nature decided to keep that stuff in the ground, not us. Who are we to go against it?",1.0,1.0,,k1oPVp63eNk,

""We're filing in all swing states a demand that judges step in and preserve evidence to avoid it from being destroyed or spoiled by the intentional or reckless acts of executive officials,"" said Phill Kline, director of the Amistad Project, which has previously filed election litigation in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. 

The report claims that the ""tabulation log for the forensic examination of the server for Antrim County from December 6, 2020 consists of 15,676 individual events, of which 10,667 or 68.05% of the events were recorded errors."" The Federal Election Commission allows a maximum error rate of just 0.0008 percent.

""The error rate detailed in this report has implications for every state where we have litigation, and it comes on a day when officials are blocking legislators from having their say about elections in their states,"" Kline said. ""This joins with other compelling evidence that the elections in these states cannot be certified under the law.""

Investigators believe the error rate in Antrim County is an intentional flaw built into the software in order to compel ""bulk adjudication"" of ballots by election officials — a process that allows alteration of ballots with minimal or no meaningful oversight. Antrim County maintains records of the adjudication process for previous elections, but records for the 2020 election were either deleted or never entered, making it impossible to determine whether adjudicated ballots accurately reflected the intent of the voters.

The Michigan Bureau of Election also issued a memorandum on December 1 instructing election clerks that electronic poll book files must be deleted from all laptops and flash drives. The Amistad Project is asking judges in all swing states to issue emergency orders preventing state and local officials from destroying such evidence.

""In Michigan, the Secretary of State has ordered deletion of e-poll books and other evidence and also has taken affirmative steps to seal forensic evidence regarding the flaws in the operation of Dominion machines from both the public and from legislators who need access to this information in order to perform their constitutional duty,"" Kline said. ""This joins with the Michigan Attorney General threatening legislators with criminal investigation and possible prosecution if they disagree with her, and the Michigan Governor and other officials shutting down the peoples' house and preventing them from gathering today to perform their constitutional duty.""

I find it interesting that opinion on this post is running about 75% for and 25% against which is line with national polling. Conclusion is that American leadership will now again reflect the will of the people compared to past four years of undemocratic rule. Past two elections have shown 10 MILLION popular vote edge for Clinton and Biden. Electoral College is responsible for inaction on climate change. It must be abolished. QED.,1.0,0.0,,ykSpM50paoY,

Not a US resident? Look up the standard rearing/slaughtering methods of your country, it is most likely the same/even more brutal

According to the American dietetic association (consisting of 100,000 professionals in health and nutrition) we can thrive on a vegan diet... at evry stage of life... pregnancy, lactation &infancy... this is backed by the British dietetic association, the Canadian dietic association, as well as the NHS 
Furthermore the United Nation published a 40 page report titled Livestock's Long Shadow detailing every envionmental issue we face as a result of animal agriculture.... the list is extensive everything from global warming, climate change, water pollution, resource depletion, antibiotics resistance, deforestation (to make room for feed crops) leading to habitat loss and species extinction at an unprecedented rate... and so on

Still insist we have valid reasons for meat consumption? Look up ""earthling ed ted talk every argument against veganism"" he will debunk all the best points waged against vegans

Finally, I have to add because people seem oblivious to the cruelty of dairy and eggs. Vegetarians please make the connection. Search this up ""why aren't vegans just vegetarian earthling ed""
***If you believe in this cause, please become an activist... the animals dont have a voice... please be their voice****

If you're a U.S resident look up ""earthlings documentary""
If you're in UK - look up ""land of hope and glory earthling ed""
If youre in Australia look up ""dominion documentary""

Yes. He would be the oldest president in history at his inauguration, at age 78. Mr. Trump, who is currently 74, would also be the oldest president ever if he wins a second term.

2. Where is Joe Biden from?
Mr. Biden was born in Scranton, Pa., in 1942, and moved to Delaware as a child. As a politician, he has maintained close political ties to both states, though Mr. Trump has accused Mr. Biden of having “deserted” Pennsylvania.

“I was in third grade,” Mr. Biden shot back.

He continues to maintain strong ties to Pennsylvania, a critical general election battleground that Mr. Trump won in 2016, and he has based his campaign headquarters in Philadelphia.

3. What role does the Obama era play in Joe Biden’s campaign?
A big one. Mr. Obama did not endorse Mr. Biden until the primary race was settled, but he and Mr. Biden forged a close relationship in his administration. Mr. Biden talks about their friendship frequently, as well as the work they did together on issues ranging from health care to foreign policy.

Throughout the primary, some of Mr. Biden’s biggest applause at campaign events came as he praised Mr. Obama. And many Democratic voters, especially African-American voters, have cited his relationship with Mr. Obama and nostalgia for that administration in explaining their current support for Mr. Biden. Now that the primary is over, Mr. Biden is also focused on winning the enthusiastic support of Democrats who supported other candidates and are lukewarm toward his candidacy — and his campaign must also think about engaging independent voters and moderate Republicans.",3.0,0.0,,ykSpM50paoY,

As the coronavirus crisis has unfolded, he has looked for ways to help voters picture him as commander in chief, formulating recommendations rooted in advice from health care and economics experts. Those suggestions include making coronavirus tests broadly accessible, and free. He has said there should be no out-of-pocket cost for patients to receive an eventual vaccine, either. And he has been sharply critical of President Trump’s response to the virus, accusing him of reacting too slowly.

Mr. Biden served as vice president in the Obama administration during the passage of the Affordable Care Act, and health care remains a top priority for him. It’s an issue he often discusses in the context of his family’s personal tragedies: He lost his first wife and an infant daughter in a car accident in 1972, and in 2015, his son Beau Biden died of brain cancer. Health care, he said in an early television ad, is “personal” to him. He supports adding a public option to the Affordable Care Act, but opposes “Medicare for all,” the sweeping single-payer measure advocated by some progressives in his party, including Senator Bernie Sanders.

Mr. Biden, who served for decades in the Senate, firmly believes in the value of bipartisanship and insists on extending overtures to Republicans even in a moment when many in his own party don’t see negotiating partners on the other side. As a former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he also speaks passionately about asserting and defending America’s role as a leader on the global stage.",1.0,0.0,,ykSpM50paoY,

Yes they do have bad air quality, but they have made significant strides to curb this, such as planting millions of trees as my colleague above stated, they began heavily incorporating bikes into their cities. How am I pro China when I want to rival their manufacturing of renewable devices, I want the US to become the #1 manufacturer, that was in Biden’s campaign. He and I want to lead the world in this area, thereby dominating the world market and taking the title away from China. How is that pro-China. You are the one who wants to leave China alone and let them dominate the market. Look, all I’m saying is that the US has an opportunity here to lead the world in manufacturing as we once did. We can dominate the world market and create millions of high paying, safe, union, long lasting, jobs, and help the environment all at the same time. But you don’t want that clearly. You’d rather let China do that. This is not a debate on whether China is the #1 polluter, yes it is, that is undeniable. But that doesn’t mean they can’t also make humongous strides to undo that and do,image the market. Thereby stripping the US of an amazing opportunity. Green energy is the future.

Many people think that the cause of climate change is carbon dioxide, and reducing carbon dioxide can prevent climate change.
This is a bit convincing, but not correct.
The exact cause of climate change is ""thermal excess"" on the earth.
Therefore, to stop climate change, we must focus on stopping of the ""thermal excess"".

""GREEN NEW DEAL"" has good intentions. However, there are several problems. 
The biggest problem is that it is less economical. It means that it is difficult for many people to actively participate. 
Therefore, coercion must be mobilized to achieve the desired goal, and excessive coercion hinders the achievement of the goal. 
This is a fundamental problem.
Also, waste is another problem. 
Waste solar cells and waste blades are discharged, and the waste batteries of ESS adversely affect the environment.

Although there is a problem with the need for large land, the best way to reduce heat and carbon dioxide is to create big forests.
Trump should publicize the effects of ""One trillion trees"" to others and urge the world to join in and work together.

Why is ""One trillion trees"" so effective?
First of all, it is economical. Compared to solar power generation and wind power generation, it does not require a lot of funds at the beginning. 
forests has a long lifespan, and does not require additional facilities such as ESS and power transmission and distribution facilities, and does not emit waste.

In addition, One trillion trees absorb enormous amounts of solar heat.
Photosynthesis requires infrared rays from the sun.
It absorbs infrared rays (heat rays) and ultraviolet rays to perform photosynthesis, turning carbon dioxide into oxygen and making glucose.
One trillion trees absorbing solar heat is very good at slowing down climate change. 
The reason people don't really care about trees absorbing heat is that they don't think the cause of global warming is fundamentally ""overheating,"" but rather carbon dioxide.

Article 2
1. This Agreement, in enhancing the implementation of the Convention,
including its objective, aims to strengthen the global response to the threat of
climate change, in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate
poverty, including by:
(a) Holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below
2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature
increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would
significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change; 

(b) Increasing the ability to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate
change and foster climate resilience and low greenhouse gas emissions
development, in a manner that does not threaten food production; and
(c) Making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low
greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development.

No cars with engines from 2030 (hybrids ok until ‘35 I think), I have 8 different boxes, sacks and bins for individual recycling. We’re charged for using bags when going to the shop and inundated with climate guilt daily. I can’t drink my soda at McDonald’s/restaurants after 2 or 3 min because we have to use cardboard straws (not ready for deployment and ironically they’re one of few items not recycled so dumb idea). Can’t drive into cities because of expensive congestion tax, tho rich don’t care. Apparently we’re going to be carbon neutral country by 2050 which has got to be possible here with all the wind/wave energy. That said, I really feel like we’re taking constant hits for the team in the uk by developed world standards when places like America & Australia are literally not even pretending to try. I want more bike lanes and incentives for people to switch over to electric vehicles even more quickly but this is really beginning to feel like an issue that only certain countries are bothering with whilst others talk but do nothing for decades now.

This is false because, first, 95 percent of the greenhouse gas effect in Earth's atmosphere is caused by water vapor. 1/3rd of the remaining 5 percent is CO2 gas. 3 percent of this is man's total contribution since 1850 accounting for an estimated 0.1 percent of the greenhouse gas effect.

Second, 95 percent of the narrow band of infrared radiation available for CO2 to emmit is doing so already. So doubling CO2 would make no measurable difference.

Third, changes in the appearance of atmospheric CO2 gas occur at least 800 years AFTER changes in temperature. CO2 is an effect, not a cause.

Since the peak of the Little Ice Age 350 years ago, the global mean surface temperature has been rising at a rate of 0.8C/century and, to this day, hasn't deviated by more than 1.5 percent from the mean.

Other causes such as changes in ocean currents, solar activity or cosmic rays have been considered thoroughly, and they simply don't correlate with the recent rise in global temperature and can therefore be excluded as the main cause.

Assume I am driving car for 10 hours continuously without any break with different speed. So first 7 hours, I drive at varying speeds not exceeding 50 miles/hr and then in last 3 hours, I increase my speed by 1.5 times after each hour. 
So, assume I am at 50 miles/hr at end of 7 hours. So after eighth hour, I am at (50*1.5=75 miles/hr) and after ninth hour, I am at (75*1.5=112.5 miles/hr) and finally at the end of tenth hour, my speed is (112.5*1.5=168.75 miles/hr).

So as per your logic, I will say my increase in speed per hour was: (168.75 - 0.0)/10 = 16.875 miles/hour. BUT THAT IS WRONG.

In reality, I was slow and did not exceed 50 miles/hr for first 7 hours and then I ACCELERATED ONLY IN LAST 3 HOURS. 

So my average increase in speed per hour WILL GIVE ME FALSE IMPRESSION THAT I DID NOT ACCELERATE IN THE END AND 16.875 miles/hr is pretty decent increase in speed for 10 hour journey.  

By the way, I am not alarmist. Climate change is not like one day you get up and we all die. Climate change affects subtly. For example, in coming years, there will be increased number of floods, droughts, frequent and stronger hurricanes and so on.  I never meant to say that climate change will hit you suddenly like a nuclear bomb. It is slow and continuously damaging in several ways. Not to mention that agriculture will suffer a lot due to seasonal variations.

In particular mentioning India as a near successful country sounds very misleading to me. Compared to counties of it's size like China and the US it's CO2 emissions per capita might be very low due to India's large population yet relative poverty compared to the US, but their CO2 emissions have been steadily increasing and still nearly 60% of India's energy comes from coal. Considering India's current economical situation it does not look like it is set up to slow down let alone reverse it's carbon emissions any time soon.

Instead of putting all your faith into a snapshot of one single metric, take a look at what's been happening over the last decade or two.

Already in the second sentence is a mistake. Carbon is not equal carbondioxide. Or would you say hydrogen is equal to water?  It is therefore also overly stupid to measure a gas in tons. Real scientists measure CO2 in the atmosphere in ppm.
In order to explain warming by CO2 they invented the theory the radiative forcing. But there is the same problem with it, like with unicorns. Everybody knows how to describe it, but nobody has ever seen one.
Besides, there is another mistery. The CO2 is still increasing, despite half of the world is in corona lockdown since 6 months.

That's because we have modernized, but it is also the period in history where there has been a rapid increase of carbon in our atmosphere. We already have an alternative to being able to modernize and emit less carbon at the same time. I'm not trying to sound the alarms and cause people to panic, but this will eventually be an existential threat if it isn't one already.

Vegan companies are thriving and the milk industry would be dead already if not for the substantial subsidies they receive from government... Meat would also be very expensive if they weren't heavily subsidised. You're right in the sense that some people will never go vegan willingly, but social pressure will definitely do it... and if not then at some point down the line laws will do it. The world is much better off without animal agriculture, for many reasons other than animal rights, many human rights issues too... it's all bunched together for me now, though initially i changed due to environmental issues. 

Look you seem like an intelligent person, I appreciate the animal rights aren't going to do it but I suggest you look into all the different areas where animal agriculture is causing harm. Once (if) you change then you wont need cognitive dissonance or an appeal to futility, and once that's out of the way you may see the true injustice and unnecessary suffering we cause to these animals. Question, do you have a dog or cat? maybe I can use pets as an example? 
But basically you don't need to love animals to be vegan, just recognise that their life is worth more than your momentary sensory pleasure. I mean given the choice to slit a cows throat yourself for a burger or eat a vegan curry I'm sure I know which one you would honestly choose.

In terms of the gun analogy... its better. However you are talking to the wrong person because I live in Portugal and no one here has guns. No one in Europe has guns. In fact its crazy to people here that that's actually allowed in the US. Aren't there many people against gun ownership though? I mean I'm sure there's many people without guns, and from what i'm seeing there's more pressure than ever to get rid of guns right? The government won't do it unless there's social pressure but that day may very well come... and in my opinion the US will be much better off...

Most likely, I suspect, there are some people who are suggestible to veganism, they need encouragement from others to make that jump but ultimately they were always predisposed to that sort of decision. The sort of word-of-mouth approach you suggest may reach say, ten to twenty percent of westerners, but I'm not sure that's really enough. If you really want a meat-free world, it would have to come from the top down, not the bottom up.

(I also note that you seem to have lapsed from making an environmental case at this point to being solely one over animal rights, which confirms my thoughts that you would have gone vegan anyway and the environmental factors are simply a side issue. Personally, I'm not too fussed over animal rights, it's just never been a high priority for me, humans are simply doing a more sophisticated version of what every apex predator before them did. This is obviously something we aren't ever going to agree on, because it is a fundamental difference in values.)

In terms of the teaching analogy, yes, I understand it is flawed. I'll give you that one. How about a better analogy - gun control in the US. Yes, gun owners could be more responsible. They could even decide to get rid of their guns voluntarily. But they just aren't going to. Whenever there is a mass shooting in the US, people blame the easy availability of lethal weapons - and they are completely right to look at government inaction rather than the individual perpetrator. I believe meat consumption (to the extent that it is polluting in a way that affects humans) is in a similar category to gun ownership.",0.0,1.0,,k1oPVp63eNk,

In order to change government (which i think is something we should do obviously) you need a large enough following. Every individual counts.  The teacher example doesnt work because you are not directly sabotaging the educational system, are you? where as by eating meat you are directly causing harm. A better example:

Every teacher uses violence on kids and it's normalised in society, you want to change the system so teachers don't hit kids whilst you are currently beating a child.

Using an inexpensive thermoelectric device, they’re able to harness the cold of space without an active heat input. The process, called radiative sky cooling, can generate enough electricity to power an LED light. Think of it as similar to solar panels, except using the change in the night temperature for power rather than the sun.

The sun is getting hotter at a rate of about 0.5% per decade. That may not sound like a lot, but calculate it using the temperature of the sun and you'll see it's a significant amount compared to earth. This is from NASA's website and they themselves say this could cause climate change. I can't help you if you don't believe this.

And both mine and your links about the windmills use math, so neither are wrong. The methods for calculating are what matter. If you expect a windmill to last 10 years it would make back it's carbon footprint, but I don't expect them to last longer than 3 years.

We have until 2030 to end fossil emissions entirely.

It's also better than the video implies. Lynchpin nations punch above their weight contributing to fossil emissions through export, import and trade. Get these handful of nations to scale back to zero fossil emissions and fossil trade and they can reduce world fossil emissions in half, and they can do it unilaterally. More, they can start a virtuous cycle of swapping fossil for renewable as the technology improves and fossil free prices come down through economies of scale.


Start with Canada, responsible for 14% of global fossil emissions despite its tiny 1.6% of domestic direct emissions; get rid of Canada's bitumen extraction, and 7% of the world's fossil emissions disappear. Will other suppliers step in to fill the void of the world's 4th largest fossil exporter? They may, but they'll drive the price up as supplies are constrained 5%, taking the world back to 2015 prices. 2015 oil prices can't compete with 2021 solar prices, or wind or geothermal; conventional 2015 cars can't compete with 2021 electric vehicles. For the rest, Canada needs to stop exporting coal, which will also end US coal exports as US ports won't handle the stuff, and Canada is only obliged to ship American coal if it ships Canadian coal. That leaves Canada's fossil-intensive imports, which it can over the next decade drop to zero; Canada's already 82% fossil free on its electricity grids and has plenty of expertise for Hybrit steel and Elysis aluminum, basalt fiber, geopolymer cement, even biochar production to displace carbon in silicon fabrication.

Move to Australia, infamous for its coal exports. Anything Canada can do, Australia can do standing on its head.

Go through the list of key fossil emission contributors and you'll find more than enough muscle in just a few nations -- enough to skip over the usual suspects like Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, the USA, Russia, China and India -- and get it done.

Cap relative to 2019 levels fossil emitting trade and extraction at 90% in 2021, 80% in 2022, 70% in 2023 down to 0% in 2030 and the Market will rush to invest in fossil free innovation. Lead the target to hit the target.

One of the main things is that their energy output is very low compared to their production cost. Future is not in renewable sources of energy, they are simply not enough to support our civilization on energetic level that it needs. (until you build a solar panel Dyson swarm of course :D)
But at the moment, nuclear energy is the best possible source of energy that we have in our hands. There are no emissions, much less people die in accidents compared to other kinds of plants, etc.. And if you want to mention Chernobyl, then do not forget that that was fault of the poor maintenance of the soviets. Also, there are no emissions from nuclear power plants. Only thing that you need is to store the waste and if you do not dump it into the lake or somewhere similar, then you're pretty much alright.

There's no action, just laziness, I wouldn't say on the part of the speakers, but of the platform itself. It also represents a certain attitude towards the issues on our planet, an attitude that says we can solve it all by talking about it and spreading our ideas. Unfortunately, that is much too slow to respond and adapt to this never-ending technological revolution. It's kind of like a rich person's pastime, where we all talk about how we're so much more advanced and our ideas are amazing, yet when it comes to it, all that it is is a pastime. It's much more comfortable to sit in a chair and listen to someone speak, then to go out and commit your entire life to the fixing of our world. That, however, is exactly what we need in order to win in the battle against ourselves. Then again, I suppose TED is pretty much powerless to do anything... well... you could talk about controversial subjects that will end up angering either the US, China, Russia, or the EU, but we all know that will never happen. Everyone's stuck in this seemingly endless cycle, one where we're arguing for the sake of arguing, following rules that we didn't have a hand in creating, rules that evolution instinctually gave to us. But we never question them. Society tells us to jump and we do so without any notion of doing otherwise. Honestly, climate change isn't an issue. What we really need to change is how we view life itself. For there is no reason to covet wealth or power but the words of those with wealth and power. Why haven't we stopped to think for once, and realized that all those in power want you to do is to work for them. There no benefits for yourself but a life slaving away for someone who views you as a number on a page. Go against the grain, stop listening to the rich people telling you what to think, what to learn, and what to do. If you want to live a good life it really is as simple(yet difficult) as that.

In my last comment I meant pollutants which are green house gases - with CO2 being the main one, although there are also others, sorry for not clarifying that. The Scotese + Berner studies are used quite a lot in climate denialism, but they simplify climate science. We know that things were different in the past and in the paleozoic era the solar output was a lot lower, so the high CO2 levels helped the planet maintain a stable climate.

With regard to climate change, I don't really see why small businesses would be hit harder than big businesses because any tax levied would presumably scale with turnover, and the big businesses would therefore pay more. Let's say you have two haulage firms, A and B. A has ten times as many lorries as B, it has ten times the turnover and makes ten times the profit. Its lorry fleet covers ten times the distance of B's, so it's also using ten times as much carbon as B, and it would have to pay ten times as much in carbon taxes - the same proportion of its profits.

First and foremost, that'd be overpopulation, which leads to excess deforestation. Then the most obvious one is industrialization. The next one would be more and more people buying private vehicles which wasn't the case, say about 100 years back. So I don't think you would argue with THAT. Vehicle exhaust is one of the top reasons of poor quality air in developing and developed countries. All of these factors add up and that leads to dramatic CO2 rise. And these are ALL anthropogenic (man made) factors. There's that about rising CO2 level.
Now about *why* ? Its just basic chemistry. The molecules of greenhouse gases have very good heat trapping capabilities. G.g. molecules can absorb energy from infrared (IR) radiations, basically photons(packets of energy) & energy from the photon causes the CO2 molecule to vibrate. Some time later, the molecule gives up this extra energy by emitting another infrared photon. Once the extra energy has been removed by the emitted photon, the carbon dioxide molecule stops vibrating. Molecules are constantly in motion, colliding with other gas molecules and transferring energy from one molecule to another during collisions. In the more-complex, real-world process, a CO2 molecule would most likely bump into several other gas molecules before re-emitting the infrared photon. The CO2 molecule might transfer the energy it gained from the absorbed photon to another molecule, adding speed to that molecule's motion. Since the temperature of a gas is a measure of the speed of the molecules in the gas, the faster motion of a molecule that eventually results from the IR photon that was absorbed by a CO2 molecule raises the temperature of the gases in the atmosphere.

This ability to absorb and re-emit infrared energy is what makes CO2 an effective heat-trapping greenhouse gas. Not all gas molecules are able to absorb IR radiation. For example, nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2), which make up more than 90% of Earth's atmosphere, do not absorb infrared photons. CO2 molecules can vibrate in ways that simpler nitrogen and oxygen molecules cannot, which allows CO2 molecules to capture the IR photons. Greenhouse gases and the greenhouse effect play an important role in Earth's climate. Without greenhouse gases, our planet would be a frozen ball of ice. In recent years, however, excess emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from human activities (mostly burning fossil fuels) have begun to warm Earth's climate at a problematic rate. Other significant greenhouse gases include water vapor (H2O), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and ozone (O3).

Also, what point in our Earth's past? Our Eart has gone through several climate cycles, all of which had an underlying cause, such as atmospheric composition, mind you. There were points in time when dinosaurs roamed the Earth where, yes average CO2 was higher (not sure about ten times higher but whatever), but so was average global temperatures and sea levels.

What weather events? Hurricanes, tropical storms, wildfires, volcanic activity? You gotta specify. Regardless, the climate doesn't stop certain things from happening. The most severe hurricane could've happened ten thousand years ago but that wouldn't change anything. It's the increase in average severity that matters.

As far as your last remark, I really don't understand what you mean by any of that. Genuine question, is English your native language? No insult there if it's not. You're doing a good enough job at speaking it that I have to ask, and I can only speak one language, so good on you. However, there are some confusing word choices and grammatical and structural decisions here and there that are making things a bit harder to understand at times.

Though, quite frankly, I'm not sure I'm too interested in keeping engaged with this. There isn't much of a discussion happening here, if I'm being brutally honest. I say things, you shrug them off and reply with loosely related things that either aren't really arguments or are based off of bad data, like a YouTube video that wouldn't hold up to any sort of scientific scrutiny, or subjective perceptions and morals, or both. I'm trying my best here to keep an open mind in the exchange of knowledge and ideas, but it seems you're more interested in being right or ""pwning the climate commies"" or whatever then trying to enhance your understanding of a topic while sharpening your mind. For that reason, this isn't a discussion or an argument or any of that. It's a dumb stupid fight, the online discourse version of mud wrestling, and I don't participate in such things. Shame that most discourse seems to go that way.",1.0,1.0,,k1oPVp63eNk,

Saying carbon dioxide is a fundamental product of life, while technically true, is deceptive wording. Carbon dioxide is literally a biological waste product. You exhale to excrete it. Feces and urine are also fundamental products of life by that logic, yet I don't think you're going to argue against plumbing.

""We're filing in all swing states a demand that judges step in and preserve evidence to avoid it from being destroyed or spoiled by the intentional or reckless acts of executive officials,"" said Phill Kline, director of the Amistad Project, which has previously filed election litigation in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. 

The report claims that the ""tabulation log for the forensic examination of the server for Antrim County from December 6, 2020 consists of 15,676 individual events, of which 10,667 or 68.05% of the events were recorded errors."" The Federal Election Commission allows a maximum error rate of just 0.0008 percent.

""The error rate detailed in this report has implications for every state where we have litigation, and it comes on a day when officials are blocking legislators from having their say about elections in their states,"" Kline said. ""This joins with other compelling evidence that the elections in these states cannot be certified under the law.""

Investigators believe the error rate in Antrim County is an intentional flaw built into the software in order to compel ""bulk adjudication"" of ballots by election officials — a process that allows alteration of ballots with minimal or no meaningful oversight. Antrim County maintains records of the adjudication process for previous elections, but records for the 2020 election were either deleted or never entered, making it impossible to determine whether adjudicated ballots accurately reflected the intent of the voters.

The Michigan Bureau of Election also issued a memorandum on December 1 instructing election clerks that electronic poll book files must be deleted from all laptops and flash drives. The Amistad Project is asking judges in all swing states to issue emergency orders preventing state and local officials from destroying such evidence.

""In Michigan, the Secretary of State has ordered deletion of e-poll books and other evidence and also has taken affirmative steps to seal forensic evidence regarding the flaws in the operation of Dominion machines from both the public and from legislators who need access to this information in order to perform their constitutional duty,"" Kline said. ""This joins with the Michigan Attorney General threatening legislators with criminal investigation and possible prosecution if they disagree with her, and the Michigan Governor and other officials shutting down the peoples' house and preventing them from gathering today to perform their constitutional duty.""

Conclusion is that American leadership will now again reflect the will of the people compared to past four years of undemocratic rule.

Not a US resident? Look up the standard rearing/slaughtering methods of your country, it is most likely the same/even more brutal

According to the American dietetic association (consisting of 100,000 professionals in health and nutrition) we can thrive on a vegan diet... at evry stage of life... pregnancy, lactation &infancy... this is backed by the British dietetic association, the Canadian dietic association, as well as the NHS 
Furthermore the United Nation published a 40 page report titled Livestock's Long Shadow detailing every envionmental issue we face as a result of animal agriculture.... the list is extensive everything from global warming, climate change, water pollution, resource depletion, antibiotics resistance, deforestation (to make room for feed crops) leading to habitat loss and species extinction at an unprecedented rate... and so on

Still insist we have valid reasons for meat consumption? Look up ""earthling ed ted talk every argument against veganism"" he will debunk all the best points waged against vegans

Finally, I have to add because people seem oblivious to the cruelty of dairy and eggs. Vegetarians please make the connection. Search this up ""why aren't vegans just vegetarian earthling ed""
***If you believe in this cause, please become an activist... the animals dont have a voice... please be their voice****

If you're a U.S resident look up ""earthlings documentary""
If you're in UK - look up ""land of hope and glory earthling ed""
If youre in Australia look up ""dominion documentary""

Yes. He would be the oldest president in history at his inauguration, at age 78. Mr. Trump, who is currently 74, would also be the oldest president ever if he wins a second term.

2. Where is Joe Biden from?
Mr. Biden was born in Scranton, Pa., in 1942, and moved to Delaware as a child. As a politician, he has maintained close political ties to both states, though Mr. Trump has accused Mr. Biden of having “deserted” Pennsylvania.

“I was in third grade,” Mr. Biden shot back.

He continues to maintain strong ties to Pennsylvania, a critical general election battleground that Mr. Trump won in 2016, and he has based his campaign headquarters in Philadelphia.

3. What role does the Obama era play in Joe Biden’s campaign?
A big one. Mr. Obama did not endorse Mr. Biden until the primary race was settled, but he and Mr. Biden forged a close relationship in his administration. Mr. Biden talks about their friendship frequently, as well as the work they did together on issues ranging from health care to foreign policy.

Throughout the primary, some of Mr. Biden’s biggest applause at campaign events came as he praised Mr. Obama. And many Democratic voters, especially African-American voters, have cited his relationship with Mr. Obama and nostalgia for that administration in explaining their current support for Mr. Biden. Now that the primary is over, Mr. Biden is also focused on winning the enthusiastic support of Democrats who supported other candidates and are lukewarm toward his candidacy — and his campaign must also think about engaging independent voters and moderate Republicans.",3.0,0.0,,ykSpM50paoY,

As the coronavirus crisis has unfolded, he has looked for ways to help voters picture him as commander in chief, formulating recommendations rooted in advice from health care and economics experts. Those suggestions include making coronavirus tests broadly accessible, and free. He has said there should be no out-of-pocket cost for patients to receive an eventual vaccine, either. And he has been sharply critical of President Trump’s response to the virus, accusing him of reacting too slowly.

Mr. Biden served as vice president in the Obama administration during the passage of the Affordable Care Act, and health care remains a top priority for him. It’s an issue he often discusses in the context of his family’s personal tragedies: He lost his first wife and an infant daughter in a car accident in 1972, and in 2015, his son Beau Biden died of brain cancer. Health care, he said in an early television ad, is “personal” to him. He supports adding a public option to the Affordable Care Act, but opposes “Medicare for all,” the sweeping single-payer measure advocated by some progressives in his party, including Senator Bernie Sanders.

Mr. Biden, who served for decades in the Senate, firmly believes in the value of bipartisanship and insists on extending overtures to Republicans even in a moment when many in his own party don’t see negotiating partners on the other side. As a former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he also speaks passionately about asserting and defending America’s role as a leader on the global stage.",1.0,0.0,,ykSpM50paoY,

Yes they do have bad air quality, but they have made significant strides to curb this, such as planting millions of trees as my colleague above stated, they began heavily incorporating bikes into their cities. How am I pro China when I want to rival their manufacturing of renewable devices, I want the US to become the #1 manufacturer, that was in Biden’s campaign. He and I want to lead the world in this area, thereby dominating the world market and taking the title away from China. How is that pro-China. You are the one who wants to leave China alone and let them dominate the market. Look, all I’m saying is that the US has an opportunity here to lead the world in manufacturing as we once did. We can dominate the world market and create millions of high paying, safe, union, long lasting, jobs, and help the environment all at the same time. But you don’t want that clearly. You’d rather let China do that. This is not a debate on whether China is the #1 polluter, yes it is, that is undeniable. But that doesn’t mean they can’t also make humongous strides to undo that and do,image the market. Thereby stripping the US of an amazing opportunity. Green energy is the future.

If private industry can come up with innovations that cost nearly as much or less than the current conveniences the customers already enjoy, the new things sell. 

The government has a long history of trying to help innovation along (look into steam boats and the trans continental rail road. talk about a turd sandwich there) and doing an awful job. 

this is the same bunch of people who invest in million dollar turtle tunnels under a road. or studies about how well Chinese hookers handle their liquor, in china (yup, those are real government projects and studies. The list of crap the government wastes money on is egregious). 

I'm not saying some of these should be invested in. I'm pretty sure Solar roads, if there is ever a chance of it actually becoming a thing is going to require the government coughing up some serious dough to make it happen. The benefits would be staggering. They put heating elements in the road so no ice or snow will stick. LED's and pressure sensors so the road can warn drivers of animals in the road (or people) inductive plates so electric cars can charge while driving. Fiber optics run to allow for near instantaneous communications along the road, to allow for load switching with the added bonus of every single place in the US connected through a web network to everyplace else via Fiber. Talk about an increase in internet connectivity. The benefits to the people are massive...and so will the price tag. Not even counting the electrical benefit. would theoretically eliminate the need for all but a small number of power plants. (no more coal burning). If more and more people switched to electric cars, as long as they drive on solar roads they'd stay mostly charged and could go for longer and farther. With the pressure sensors and fiber I could see self driving electric cars controlled by a central traffic computers in major cities. Almost no gas powered vehicles anymore. 

you want to make the US almost a negative carbon footprint? push for solar roads. 

Problem is, there's not huge wads of cash to be wedged into back pockets as easily with solar roads. If the government just make up stupid laws and taxes to squeeze more money out of us, that's a LOT easier and quicker. Any legislation done by the government about climate change is almost certainly corrupt money and power grab. It's just too easy to grab the cash rather than actually try and fix the problem.",0.0,1.0,,1yxeRrOtT7g,

Money to research and information gathering as well as environmental cleaning and pollution reduction is also needed. The parts of the economy that is less inhabitated by private companies needs money too. Im not saying Obama is doing the right thing by giving out a bag of money but for sure there has to be both companies and institutions who needs more funding or else we would all be emmision free in no time. Money and competition is by far the best motivators or factors when it comes to innovation after all. Also there needs to be more funding to stop deforestation, more water cleaning, less air pollution and work on other environmental issues is a good thing if you ask me. 
Yes the strategy about picking the winners is overall a short-term good investment and is mostly supported when the government is involved. I dont think if we let global warming go on as it is right now, even with all these new forms of technology, will be enough. We need agreements and legislations when it comes to our emmisions.

there's a company called HyperSolar that's developed a method of cleaning polluted water by breaking the bonds in the water using solar power to extract hydrogen and in the process cleans the water.

graphene is incredible and when it's commercially available it's going to make batteries that can be charged in nothing flat and hold a charge like none other. used in manufacturing computer chips they can reduce the size by a factor and it has a conductivity factor that is nearly as good if not better than gold. oh, and when it is used up or is no longer working? it's carbon. about as environmentally friendly as you can get. 

there's some new technology going into making new solar cells that are a LOT better than what's currently available and are cheaper. if that tech is combined with solar roads the electric grid in the US will become solid as a rock and cheap to boot. 

all this...every bit of it. ALL of it is being done by private industry using capitalism as an innovation tool to push the technology to it's limits by creating things better, faster and cheaper. Some are getting subsidies, but very few of them and what they're getting is less than what the government is subsidizing oil companies. 

this is all great, but when the government starts creating legislation to push this agenda of ""steal from those that have and give to those they feel today they want to give money to"". It's the opposite of helpful. it stops innovation. It prevents people from creating new and better things.

In Sweden they made a building material that is almost transparent so you can put solarcells behind it making it highly efficient and robust in areas with harsh weather. In Denmark they are producing some of the best windpower turbines and is sharing technology with developing countries to diversify their industry. Even a company like Google is making sustainability reports and trying to give its company a greener image. Greenland was mentioned in this video and do you know how they want to become more independent from Denmark?

Countries with larger populations are obviously going to be responsible for a higher percent but that doesn't necessarily mean that they are more environmentally unfriendly.
I had a lecture on the environment yesterday and a good way of looking at it is to ask: if every countrt in the world operated like this country, how many planets would we need. The US were the worst at 5 and India fared the best at 0.4. Yet India are included on their diagram making me question the method they use. China which they aligned with the US in this video stands at 1 planet. China and India have massive populations skewing things enourmously.
There are many European countries which were not highlighted despite being extremely unsustainable possibly due to lower popupations. My own country of Ireland is a great example. We have a horrific system where nobody cares about the environment. We are probably around the UK yet we are not on the diagram probably because we only have a population of 4.5m.
Brazil, to my knowledge, has a large population likely skewing things. I do not know how Brazil is eco-wise though.

all of this reminds me of the movie Apocalypto...by Gibson...

It is true that climate change is a natural thing,but pollution is making this process faster.
The Paris agreement is meant to atleast slow it down or atleast stop it from getting faster,so we have time to figure out something that would allow us to survive,stuff like leaving the planet,being able to stop the process completely or even reverse it.

Many people think that the cause of climate change is carbon dioxide, and reducing carbon dioxide can prevent climate change.
This is a bit convincing, but not correct.
The exact cause of climate change is ""thermal excess"" on the earth.
Therefore, to stop climate change, we must focus on stopping of the ""thermal excess"".

""GREEN NEW DEAL"" has good intentions. However, there are several problems. 
The biggest problem is that it is less economical. It means that it is difficult for many people to actively participate. 
Therefore, coercion must be mobilized to achieve the desired goal, and excessive coercion hinders the achievement of the goal. 
This is a fundamental problem.
Also, waste is another problem. 
Waste solar cells and waste blades are discharged, and the waste batteries of ESS adversely affect the environment.

Although there is a problem with the need for large land, the best way to reduce heat and carbon dioxide is to create big forests.
Trump should publicize the effects of ""One trillion trees"" to others and urge the world to join in and work together.

Why is ""One trillion trees"" so effective?
First of all, it is economical. Compared to solar power generation and wind power generation, it does not require a lot of funds at the beginning. 
forests has a long lifespan, and does not require additional facilities such as ESS and power transmission and distribution facilities, and does not emit waste.

In addition, One trillion trees absorb enormous amounts of solar heat.
Photosynthesis requires infrared rays from the sun.
It absorbs infrared rays (heat rays) and ultraviolet rays to perform photosynthesis, turning carbon dioxide into oxygen and making glucose.
One trillion trees absorbing solar heat is very good at slowing down climate change. 
The reason people don't really care about trees absorbing heat is that they don't think the cause of global warming is fundamentally ""overheating,"" but rather carbon dioxide.

including its objective, aims to strengthen the global response to the threat of
climate change, in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate
poverty, including by:
(a) Holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below
2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature
increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would
significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change; 

(b) Increasing the ability to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate
change and foster climate resilience and low greenhouse gas emissions
development, in a manner that does not threaten food production; and
(c) Making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low
greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development.

This is false because, first, 95 percent of the greenhouse gas effect in Earth's atmosphere is caused by water vapor. 1/3rd of the remaining 5 percent is CO2 gas. 3 percent of this is man's total contribution since 1850 accounting for an estimated 0.1 percent of the greenhouse gas effect.

Second, 95 percent of the narrow band of infrared radiation available for CO2 to emmit is doing so already. So doubling CO2 would make no measurable difference.

Third, changes in the appearance of atmospheric CO2 gas occur at least 800 years AFTER changes in temperature. CO2 is an effect, not a cause.

Since the peak of the Little Ice Age 350 years ago, the global mean surface temperature has been rising at a rate of 0.8C/century and, to this day, hasn't deviated by more than 1.5 percent from the mean.

Assume I am driving car for 10 hours continuously without any break with different speed. So first 7 hours, I drive at varying speeds not exceeding 50 miles/hr and then in last 3 hours, I increase my speed by 1.5 times after each hour. 
So, assume I am at 50 miles/hr at end of 7 hours. So after eighth hour, I am at (50*1.5=75 miles/hr) and after ninth hour, I am at (75*1.5=112.5 miles/hr) and finally at the end of tenth hour, my speed is (112.5*1.5=168.75 miles/hr).

So as per your logic, I will say my increase in speed per hour was: (168.75 - 0.0)/10 = 16.875 miles/hour. BUT THAT IS WRONG.

In reality, I was slow and did not exceed 50 miles/hr for first 7 hours and then I ACCELERATED ONLY IN LAST 3 HOURS. 

So my average increase in speed per hour WILL GIVE ME FALSE IMPRESSION THAT I DID NOT ACCELERATE IN THE END AND 16.875 miles/hr is pretty decent increase in speed for 10 hour journey.  

By the way, I am not alarmist. Climate change is not like one day you get up and we all die. Climate change affects subtly. For example, in coming years, there will be increased number of floods, droughts, frequent and stronger hurricanes and so on.  I never meant to say that climate change will hit you suddenly like a nuclear bomb. It is slow and continuously damaging in several ways. Not to mention that agriculture will suffer a lot due to seasonal variations. 

You can close your eyes to science, its your personal choice. But at least don't put wrong mathematics for its justification.",1.0,1.0,,k1oPVp63eNk,

Already in the second sentence is a mistake. Carbon is not equal carbondioxide. Or would you say hydrogen is equal to water?  It is therefore also overly stupid to measure a gas in tons. Real scientists measure CO2 in the atmosphere in ppm.
In order to explain warming by CO2 they invented the theory the radiative forcing. But there is the same problem with it, like with unicorns. Everybody knows how to describe it, but nobody has ever seen one.
Besides, there is another mistery. The CO2 is still increasing, despite half of the world is in corona lockdown since 6 months.

Vegan companies are thriving and the milk industry would be dead already if not for the substantial subsidies they receive from government... Meat would also be very expensive if they weren't heavily subsidised. You're right in the sense that some people will never go vegan willingly, but social pressure will definitely do it... and if not then at some point down the line laws will do it. The world is much better off without animal agriculture, for many reasons other than animal rights, many human rights issues too... it's all bunched together for me now, though initially i changed due to environmental issues. 

Look you seem like an intelligent person, I appreciate the animal rights aren't going to do it but I suggest you look into all the different areas where animal agriculture is causing harm. Once (if) you change then you wont need cognitive dissonance or an appeal to futility, and once that's out of the way you may see the true injustice and unnecessary suffering we cause to these animals. Question, do you have a dog or cat? maybe I can use pets as an example? 
But basically you don't need to love animals to be vegan, just recognise that their life is worth more than your momentary sensory pleasure. I mean given the choice to slit a cows throat yourself for a burger or eat a vegan curry I'm sure I know which one you would honestly choose.

In terms of the gun analogy... its better. However you are talking to the wrong person because I live in Portugal and no one here has guns. No one in Europe has guns. In fact its crazy to people here that that's actually allowed in the US. Aren't there many people against gun ownership though? I mean I'm sure there's many people without guns, and from what i'm seeing there's more pressure than ever to get rid of guns right?

Most likely, I suspect, there are some people who are suggestible to veganism, they need encouragement from others to make that jump but ultimately they were always predisposed to that sort of decision. The sort of word-of-mouth approach you suggest may reach say, ten to twenty percent of westerners, but I'm not sure that's really enough. If you really want a meat-free world, it would have to come from the top down, not the bottom up.

(I also note that you seem to have lapsed from making an environmental case at this point to being solely one over animal rights, which confirms my thoughts that you would have gone vegan anyway and the environmental factors are simply a side issue. Personally, I'm not too fussed over animal rights, it's just never been a high priority for me, humans are simply doing a more sophisticated version of what every apex predator before them did. This is obviously something we aren't ever going to agree on, because it is a fundamental difference in values.)

In terms of the teaching analogy, yes, I understand it is flawed. I'll give you that one. How about a better analogy - gun control in the US. Yes, gun owners could be more responsible. They could even decide to get rid of their guns voluntarily. But they just aren't going to. Whenever there is a mass shooting in the US, people blame the easy availability of lethal weapons - and they are completely right to look at government inaction rather than the individual perpetrator. I believe meat consumption (to the extent that it is polluting in a way that affects humans) is in a similar category to gun ownership.",0.0,1.0,,k1oPVp63eNk,

In order to change government (which i think is something we should do obviously) you need a large enough following. Every individual counts.  The teacher example doesnt work because you are not directly sabotaging the educational system, are you? where as by eating meat you are directly causing harm. A better example:

Every teacher uses violence on kids and it's normalised in society, you want to change the system so teachers don't hit kids whilst you are currently beating a child.

Using an inexpensive thermoelectric device, they’re able to harness the cold of space without an active heat input. The process, called radiative sky cooling, can generate enough electricity to power an LED light. Think of it as similar to solar panels, except using the change in the night temperature for power rather than the sun.

We have until 2030 to end fossil emissions entirely.

It's also better than the video implies. Lynchpin nations punch above their weight contributing to fossil emissions through export, import and trade. Get these handful of nations to scale back to zero fossil emissions and fossil trade and they can reduce world fossil emissions in half, and they can do it unilaterally. More, they can start a virtuous cycle of swapping fossil for renewable as the technology improves and fossil free prices come down through economies of scale.


Start with Canada, responsible for 14% of global fossil emissions despite its tiny 1.6% of domestic direct emissions; get rid of Canada's bitumen extraction, and 7% of the world's fossil emissions disappear. Will other suppliers step in to fill the void of the world's 4th largest fossil exporter? They may, but they'll drive the price up as supplies are constrained 5%, taking the world back to 2015 prices. 2015 oil prices can't compete with 2021 solar prices, or wind or geothermal; conventional 2015 cars can't compete with 2021 electric vehicles. For the rest, Canada needs to stop exporting coal, which will also end US coal exports as US ports won't handle the stuff, and Canada is only obliged to ship American coal if it ships Canadian coal. That leaves Canada's fossil-intensive imports, which it can over the next decade drop to zero; Canada's already 82% fossil free on its electricity grids and has plenty of expertise for Hybrit steel and Elysis aluminum, basalt fiber, geopolymer cement, even biochar production to displace carbon in silicon fabrication.

Move to Australia, infamous for its coal exports. Anything Canada can do, Australia can do standing on its head.

Go through the list of key fossil emission contributors and you'll find more than enough muscle in just a few nations -- enough to skip over the usual suspects like Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, the USA, Russia, China and India -- and get it done.

Cap relative to 2019 levels fossil emitting trade and extraction at 90% in 2021, 80% in 2022, 70% in 2023 down to 0% in 2030 and the Market will rush to invest in fossil free innovation. Lead the target to hit the target.

There's no action, just laziness, I wouldn't say on the part of the speakers, but of the platform itself. It also represents a certain attitude towards the issues on our planet, an attitude that says we can solve it all by talking about it and spreading our ideas. Unfortunately, that is much too slow to respond and adapt to this never-ending technological revolution. It's kind of like a rich person's pastime, where we all talk about how we're so much more advanced and our ideas are amazing, yet when it comes to it, all that it is is a pastime. It's much more comfortable to sit in a chair and listen to someone speak, then to go out and commit your entire life to the fixing of our world. That, however, is exactly what we need in order to win in the battle against ourselves. Then again, I suppose TED is pretty much powerless to do anything... well... you could talk about controversial subjects that will end up angering either the US, China, Russia, or the EU, but we all know that will never happen. Everyone's stuck in this seemingly endless cycle, one where we're arguing for the sake of arguing, following rules that we didn't have a hand in creating, rules that evolution instinctually gave to us. But we never question them. Society tells us to jump and we do so without any notion of doing otherwise. Honestly, climate change isn't an issue. What we really need to change is how we view life itself. For there is no reason to covet wealth or power but the words of those with wealth and power. Why haven't we stopped to think for once, and realized that all those in power want you to do is to work for them. There no benefits for yourself but a life slaving away for someone who views you as a number on a page. Go against the grain, stop listening to the rich people telling you what to think, what to learn, and what to do. If you want to live a good life it really is as simple(yet difficult) as that.

I'm not just repeating propaganda, I'm taking about science, which is what you're also doing - if you say everything I say is commie propaganda, whilst taking everything you read that supports your argument as proof, then there's not point us talking.

In my last comment I meant pollutants which are green house gases - with CO2 being the main one, although there are also others, sorry for not clarifying that. The Scotese + Berner studies are used quite a lot in climate denialism, but they simplify climate science. We know that things were different in the past and in the paleozoic era the solar output was a lot lower, so the high CO2 levels helped the planet maintain a stable climate. Our planet is really good at regulating the climate to make life possible, the problem now is the unprecedented rate at which humans are realising CO2, depleting albedo, resulting in exponential warming that will be the 6th mass extinction of humans and billions of other species.",0.0,1.0,,k1oPVp63eNk,

The idea that we can reliably predict to the tenth of a degree what the temperature will be in 100 years, using the current models, is simply false. The idea that we can precisely predict how large of an effect a specific policy will have over 100 years, is simply false. I am not saying the models are completely wrong or that they are not useful.

Let's say you have two haulage firms, A and B. A has ten times as many lorries as B, it has ten times the turnover and makes ten times the profit. Its lorry fleet covers ten times the distance of B's, so it's also using ten times as much carbon as B, and it would have to pay ten times as much in carbon taxes - the same proportion of its profits.

First and foremost, that'd be overpopulation, which leads to excess deforestation. Then the most obvious one is industrialization. The next one would be more and more people buying private vehicles which wasn't the case, say about 100 years back. So I don't think you would argue with THAT. Vehicle exhaust is one of the top reasons of poor quality air in developing and developed countries. All of these factors add up and that leads to dramatic CO2 rise. And these are ALL anthropogenic (man made) factors. There's that about rising CO2 level.
Now about *why* ? Its just basic chemistry. The molecules of greenhouse gases have very good heat trapping capabilities. G.g. molecules can absorb energy from infrared (IR) radiations, basically photons(packets of energy) & energy from the photon causes the CO2 molecule to vibrate. Some time later, the molecule gives up this extra energy by emitting another infrared photon. Once the extra energy has been removed by the emitted photon, the carbon dioxide molecule stops vibrating. Molecules are constantly in motion, colliding with other gas molecules and transferring energy from one molecule to another during collisions. In the more-complex, real-world process, a CO2 molecule would most likely bump into several other gas molecules before re-emitting the infrared photon. The CO2 molecule might transfer the energy it gained from the absorbed photon to another molecule, adding speed to that molecule's motion. Since the temperature of a gas is a measure of the speed of the molecules in the gas, the faster motion of a molecule that eventually results from the IR photon that was absorbed by a CO2 molecule raises the temperature of the gases in the atmosphere.

This ability to absorb and re-emit infrared energy is what makes CO2 an effective heat-trapping greenhouse gas. Not all gas molecules are able to absorb IR radiation. For example, nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2), which make up more than 90% of Earth's atmosphere, do not absorb infrared photons. CO2 molecules can vibrate in ways that simpler nitrogen and oxygen molecules cannot, which allows CO2 molecules to capture the IR photons. Greenhouse gases and the greenhouse effect play an important role in Earth's climate. Without greenhouse gases, our planet would be a frozen ball of ice. In recent years, however, excess emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from human activities (mostly burning fossil fuels) have begun to warm Earth's climate at a problematic rate. Other significant greenhouse gases include water vapor (H2O), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and ozone (O3).

It's a heavy handed opinion video which cherry picks and then proceeds to misrepresent data. There's not even a whole lot to argue against there. It's just deceptive and surface level, and I think anyone who isn't trying to just reaffirm their opinions would see that.

Also, what point in our Earth's past? Our Eart has gone through several climate cycles, all of which had an underlying cause, such as atmospheric composition, mind you. There were points in time when dinosaurs roamed the Earth where, yes average CO2 was higher (not sure about ten times higher but whatever), but so was average global temperatures and sea levels.

What weather events? Hurricanes, tropical storms, wildfires, volcanic activity? You gotta specify. Regardless, the climate doesn't stop certain things from happening. The most severe hurricane could've happened ten thousand years ago but that wouldn't change anything. It's the increase in average severity that matters.

As far as your last remark, I really don't understand what you mean by any of that. Genuine question, is English your native language? No insult there if it's not. You're doing a good enough job at speaking it that I have to ask, and I can only speak one language, so good on you. However, there are some confusing word choices and grammatical and structural decisions here and there that are making things a bit harder to understand at times.

Though, quite frankly, I'm not sure I'm too interested in keeping engaged with this. There isn't much of a discussion happening here, if I'm being brutally honest. I say things, you shrug them off and reply with loosely related things that either aren't really arguments or are based off of bad data, like a YouTube video that wouldn't hold up to any sort of scientific scrutiny, or subjective perceptions and morals, or both. I'm trying my best here to keep an open mind in the exchange of knowledge and ideas, but it seems you're more interested in being right or ""pwning the climate commies"" or whatever then trying to enhance your understanding of a topic while sharpening your mind.

""We're filing in all swing states a demand that judges step in and preserve evidence to avoid it from being destroyed or spoiled by the intentional or reckless acts of executive officials,"" said Phill Kline, director of the Amistad Project, which has previously filed election litigation in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. 

The report claims that the ""tabulation log for the forensic examination of the server for Antrim County from December 6, 2020 consists of 15,676 individual events, of which 10,667 or 68.05% of the events were recorded errors."" The Federal Election Commission allows a maximum error rate of just 0.0008 percent.

""The error rate detailed in this report has implications for every state where we have litigation, and it comes on a day when officials are blocking legislators from having their say about elections in their states,"" Kline said. ""This joins with other compelling evidence that the elections in these states cannot be certified under the law.""

Investigators believe the error rate in Antrim County is an intentional flaw built into the software in order to compel ""bulk adjudication"" of ballots by election officials — a process that allows alteration of ballots with minimal or no meaningful oversight. Antrim County maintains records of the adjudication process for previous elections, but records for the 2020 election were either deleted or never entered, making it impossible to determine whether adjudicated ballots accurately reflected the intent of the voters.

The Michigan Bureau of Election also issued a memorandum on December 1 instructing election clerks that electronic poll book files must be deleted from all laptops and flash drives. The Amistad Project is asking judges in all swing states to issue emergency orders preventing state and local officials from destroying such evidence.

""In Michigan, the Secretary of State has ordered deletion of e-poll books and other evidence and also has taken affirmative steps to seal forensic evidence regarding the flaws in the operation of Dominion machines from both the public and from legislators who need access to this information in order to perform their constitutional duty,"" Kline said. ""This joins with the Michigan Attorney General threatening legislators with criminal investigation and possible prosecution if they disagree with her, and the Michigan Governor and other officials shutting down the peoples' house and preventing them from gathering today to perform their constitutional duty.""

I find it interesting that opinion on this post is running about 75% for and 25% against which is line with national polling. Conclusion is that American leadership will now again reflect the will of the people compared to past four years of undemocratic rule. Past two elections have shown 10 MILLION popular vote edge for Clinton and Biden. Electoral College is responsible for inaction on climate change. It must be abolished. QED.,1.0,0.0,,ykSpM50paoY,

Not a US resident? Look up the standard rearing/slaughtering methods of your country, it is most likely the same/even more brutal

According to the American dietetic association (consisting of 100,000 professionals in health and nutrition) we can thrive on a vegan diet... at evry stage of life... pregnancy, lactation &infancy... this is backed by the British dietetic association, the Canadian dietic association, as well as the NHS 
Furthermore the United Nation published a 40 page report titled Livestock's Long Shadow detailing every envionmental issue we face as a result of animal agriculture.... the list is extensive everything from global warming, climate change, water pollution, resource depletion, antibiotics resistance, deforestation (to make room for feed crops) leading to habitat loss and species extinction at an unprecedented rate... and so on

Still insist we have valid reasons for meat consumption? Look up ""earthling ed ted talk every argument against veganism"" he will debunk all the best points waged against vegans

Finally, I have to add because people seem oblivious to the cruelty of dairy and eggs. Vegetarians please make the connection. Search this up ""why aren't vegans just vegetarian earthling ed""
***If you believe in this cause, please become an activist... the animals dont have a voice... please be their voice****

If you're a U.S resident look up ""earthlings documentary""
If you're in UK - look up ""land of hope and glory earthling ed""
If youre in Australia look up ""dominion documentary""

Yes. He would be the oldest president in history at his inauguration, at age 78. Mr. Trump, who is currently 74, would also be the oldest president ever if he wins a second term.

2. Where is Joe Biden from?
Mr. Biden was born in Scranton, Pa., in 1942, and moved to Delaware as a child. As a politician, he has maintained close political ties to both states, though Mr. Trump has accused Mr. Biden of having “deserted” Pennsylvania.

“I was in third grade,” Mr. Biden shot back.

He continues to maintain strong ties to Pennsylvania, a critical general election battleground that Mr. Trump won in 2016, and he has based his campaign headquarters in Philadelphia.

3. What role does the Obama era play in Joe Biden’s campaign?
A big one. Mr. Obama did not endorse Mr. Biden until the primary race was settled, but he and Mr. Biden forged a close relationship in his administration. Mr. Biden talks about their friendship frequently, as well as the work they did together on issues ranging from health care to foreign policy.

Throughout the primary, some of Mr. Biden’s biggest applause at campaign events came as he praised Mr. Obama. And many Democratic voters, especially African-American voters, have cited his relationship with Mr. Obama and nostalgia for that administration in explaining their current support for Mr. Biden. Now that the primary is over, Mr. Biden is also focused on winning the enthusiastic support of Democrats who supported other candidates and are lukewarm toward his candidacy — and his campaign must also think about engaging independent voters and moderate Republicans.",3.0,0.0,,ykSpM50paoY,

As the coronavirus crisis has unfolded, he has looked for ways to help voters picture him as commander in chief, formulating recommendations rooted in advice from health care and economics experts. Those suggestions include making coronavirus tests broadly accessible, and free. He has said there should be no out-of-pocket cost for patients to receive an eventual vaccine, either. And he has been sharply critical of President Trump’s response to the virus, accusing him of reacting too slowly.

Mr. Biden served as vice president in the Obama administration during the passage of the Affordable Care Act, and health care remains a top priority for him. It’s an issue he often discusses in the context of his family’s personal tragedies: He lost his first wife and an infant daughter in a car accident in 1972, and in 2015, his son Beau Biden died of brain cancer. Health care, he said in an early television ad, is “personal” to him. He supports adding a public option to the Affordable Care Act, but opposes “Medicare for all,” the sweeping single-payer measure advocated by some progressives in his party, including Senator Bernie Sanders.

Mr. Biden, who served for decades in the Senate, firmly believes in the value of bipartisanship and insists on extending overtures to Republicans even in a moment when many in his own party don’t see negotiating partners on the other side. As a former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he also speaks passionately about asserting and defending America’s role as a leader on the global stage.",1.0,0.0,,ykSpM50paoY,

Yes they do have bad air quality, but they have made significant strides to curb this, such as planting millions of trees as my colleague above stated, they began heavily incorporating bikes into their cities. How am I pro China when I want to rival their manufacturing of renewable devices, I want the US to become the #1 manufacturer, that was in Biden’s campaign. He and I want to lead the world in this area, thereby dominating the world market and taking the title away from China. How is that pro-China. You are the one who wants to leave China alone and let them dominate the market. Look, all I’m saying is that the US has an opportunity here to lead the world in manufacturing as we once did. We can dominate the world market and create millions of high paying, safe, union, long lasting, jobs, and help the environment all at the same time. But you don’t want that clearly. You’d rather let China do that. This is not a debate on whether China is the #1 polluter, yes it is, that is undeniable.

If private industry can come up with innovations that cost nearly as much or less than the current conveniences the customers already enjoy, the new things sell. 

The government has a long history of trying to help innovation along (look into steam boats and the trans continental rail road. talk about a turd sandwich there) and doing an awful job. 

this is the same bunch of people who invest in million dollar turtle tunnels under a road. or studies about how well Chinese hookers handle their liquor, in china (yup, those are real government projects and studies. The list of crap the government wastes money on is egregious). 

I'm not saying some of these should be invested in. I'm pretty sure Solar roads, if there is ever a chance of it actually becoming a thing is going to require the government coughing up some serious dough to make it happen. The benefits would be staggering. They put heating elements in the road so no ice or snow will stick. LED's and pressure sensors so the road can warn drivers of animals in the road (or people) inductive plates so electric cars can charge while driving. Fiber optics run to allow for near instantaneous communications along the road, to allow for load switching with the added bonus of every single place in the US connected through a web network to everyplace else via Fiber. Talk about an increase in internet connectivity. The benefits to the people are massive...and so will the price tag. Not even counting the electrical benefit. would theoretically eliminate the need for all but a small number of power plants. (no more coal burning). If more and more people switched to electric cars, as long as they drive on solar roads they'd stay mostly charged and could go for longer and farther. With the pressure sensors and fiber I could see self driving electric cars controlled by a central traffic computers in major cities. Almost no gas powered vehicles anymore. 

you want to make the US almost a negative carbon footprint? push for solar roads. 

Problem is, there's not huge wads of cash to be wedged into back pockets as easily with solar roads. If the government just make up stupid laws and taxes to squeeze more money out of us, that's a LOT easier and quicker. Any legislation done by the government about climate change is almost certainly corrupt money and power grab. It's just too easy to grab the cash rather than actually try and fix the problem.",0.0,1.0,,1yxeRrOtT7g,

Money to research and information gathering as well as environmental cleaning and pollution reduction is also needed. The parts of the economy that is less inhabitated by private companies needs money too. Im not saying Obama is doing the right thing by giving out a bag of money but for sure there has to be both companies and institutions who needs more funding or else we would all be emmision free in no time. Money and competition is by far the best motivators or factors when it comes to innovation after all. Also there needs to be more funding to stop deforestation, more water cleaning, less air pollution and work on other environmental issues is a good thing if you ask me. 
Yes the strategy about picking the winners is overall a short-term good investment and is mostly supported when the government is involved. I dont think if we let global warming go on as it is right now, even with all these new forms of technology, will be enough. We need agreements and legislations when it comes to our emmisions. I think we need global cooperation otherwise the change will go too slow.",0.0,1.0,,1yxeRrOtT7g,

there's a company called HyperSolar that's developed a method of cleaning polluted water by breaking the bonds in the water using solar power to extract hydrogen and in the process cleans the water.

graphene is incredible and when it's commercially available it's going to make batteries that can be charged in nothing flat and hold a charge like none other. used in manufacturing computer chips they can reduce the size by a factor and it has a conductivity factor that is nearly as good if not better than gold. oh, and when it is used up or is no longer working? it's carbon. about as environmentally friendly as you can get. 

there's some new technology going into making new solar cells that are a LOT better than what's currently available and are cheaper. if that tech is combined with solar roads the electric grid in the US will become solid as a rock and cheap to boot. 

all this...every bit of it. ALL of it is being done by private industry using capitalism as an innovation tool to push the technology to it's limits by creating things better, faster and cheaper. Some are getting subsidies, but very few of them and what they're getting is less than what the government is subsidizing oil companies. 

this is all great, but when the government starts creating legislation to push this agenda of ""steal from those that have and give to those they feel today they want to give money to"". It's the opposite of helpful. it stops innovation. It prevents people from creating new and better things.

Countries in Africa, island countries and close to water level countries are the ones getting affected the most. Yesterday i saw a outdoor solar powered lamp i could buy for like a dollar. In Sweden they made a building material that is almost transparent so you can put solarcells behind it making it highly efficient and robust in areas with harsh weather. In Denmark they are producing some of the best windpower turbines and is sharing technology with developing countries to diversify their industry. Even a company like Google is making sustainability reports and trying to give its company a greener image. Greenland was mentioned in this video and do you know how they want to become more independent from Denmark? They want to give out rights to search for oil in the arctic area and mine its rich natural ressources.

I had a lecture on the environment yesterday and a good way of looking at it is to ask: if every countrt in the world operated like this country, how many planets would we need. The US were the worst at 5 and India fared the best at 0.4. Yet India are included on their diagram making me question the method they use. China which they aligned with the US in this video stands at 1 planet. China and India have massive populations skewing things enourmously.
There are many European countries which were not highlighted despite being extremely unsustainable possibly due to lower popupations. My own country of Ireland is a great example. We have a horrific system where nobody cares about the environment. We are probably around the UK yet we are not on the diagram probably because we only have a population of 4.5m.
Brazil, to my knowledge, has a large population likely skewing things. I do not know how Brazil is eco-wise though.

The elites of the Maya world knew perfect Astronomy, they knew about the cycles, the seasons and celestial movements like Eclipse... they used that knowledge to control the ignorant plebs into taxation, slavery, and even mass human sacrifice...what was killing them the big Drought that happen 1200 to 800 years ago...no amount of taxation or human sacrifice stopped the cycle...but people believe it.... they where played bamboozle into thinking that this was some kind of God punishing them for not offering more to their State....fast forward to today and the belief that stopping pollution will stop cosmic cycles, the belief that more taxes for Government and putting a halt on progress and technology (sacrificing maybe millions of lives that depend on that technology for survival) at the end we go back to the beginning this has nothing to do with climate...and more to do with an ideological war against free will and the free market, its about controlling every day life and nothing more....I will also like to see pollution reduce and a natural population reduction....but what we have here its an Elite (Zionist) push to destroy the Market and reduce population by force....by giving them less resources the earth population will collapse....and the climate will continue to fluctuate despite that. Just like the Maya in Apocalypto we will continue to pray to the New God...The Government to save us.",0.0,1.0,,1yxeRrOtT7g,

It is true that climate change is a natural thing,but pollution is making this process faster.
The Paris agreement is meant to atleast slow it down or atleast stop it from getting faster,so we have time to figure out something that would allow us to survive,stuff like leaving the planet,being able to stop the process completely or even reverse it.

We cannot stop the climate change,atleast not right now,but we can try slow it down and find a way that would allow us to survive.",0.0,1.0,,1yxeRrOtT7g,

First off, people are overreacting when they assume that because the U.S is pulling out of the Paris Agreement, that the planet is doomed or some shit like that. We've been decreasing our Carbon Emissions for quite a while without trying to make promises to other countries for a while now, and so far it's been pretty economically successful. It's just a thing we can do without. I mean, we're supposed to make a promise to do something that we've already been doing (plus a few extra costs that we really could do without spending) but instead with a push towards a more globalized U.S? Sounds legit...... But seriously, how is the agreement supposed to do anything about the Climate Change if it lets the biggest polluters in the world get off with increasing their emissions? And the real kicker is that they're not even required or incentivized to actually do anything about the their emissions when the time comes. The agreement is just a bunch of promises with an idealist plan of action. 

That's what pisses me off the most. The idea that we're all supposed to ""do what's right"" because of a unified sense of responsibility to the environment, regardless of whether or not it ruins a country's  economy. It's these types of people that piss me off more than anyone else (Yes, even the mindless trump bashers) just because of their sheer obliviousness to how people,  and business, and politics actually works.",0.0,0.0,,x9WFM53D1Hc,

THAT is the way a free Republic is supposed to function.  Sorry if personal responsibility frightens you but playing slave to globalist task masters should frighten you far more if you had any sense. 

 The reality is that the Paris Accords would have cost the American taxpayers upwards of $4 trillion, money that we can use to rebuild OUR OWN infrastructure using state of the art, energy efficient materials OUR WAY.  There is a lot of talent and ingenuity within our borders.  We have never before acted like cowering fools in the face of someone else's unsolicited authority.  This has to stop.  

All over youtube there are videos of EU leaders snickering as Trump spoke.  In response, the commentary sections are filled with silly millennials apologizing to the European conglomerate as if they know how and where to stand on the moral high ground.  My God!  The only man BOLD enough to stand on his own integrity among all of those so-called leaders is their own president but they lack the adulthood to grasp that!  What kind of crop of wimps are we raising here America?!  Anyone with half a brain should have been able to understand that the EU leaders were nervously giggling because they had never before seen anyone chastise their shadow masters, much like small children watching their teachers being scolded by the principle.  

America made a giant step forward they day Trump declared our independence from a globalist plot to economically rape our nation but our children think that masochistically bowing before those that so obviously despise them is the 'right thing to do'.  Why haven't they been raised to understand that masochism is not morally right?  Why haven't they been taught that it is the masochists that in fact are the cruelest of people for the very reason that they selfishly permit the hard work and aspirations of better people to be dismantled without pity.  Does anyone remember went youth meant hope?  Well, it no longer does.  Our youth now embrace the 'ethic' that to be a good person means tolerating corruption in all its forms. This is not what our forefathers fought, bled and died for.  

If we are going to save what is left of this nation from its free fall into permanent banana republicanism there is no other choice but for EVERY adult with a brain and a heart to rise to the challenge NOW while there is still time.  Trump and his people cannot do this without the help of EVERY good American doing his/her part.

Please, I implore you to each choose whatever contribution you will make to the cause of right and to implement it faithfully and fearlessly.  Make every phone call, attend every meeting, every protest, educate a new millennial daily, get those emails out to everyone on your lists (not to exceed 25 per address for safety) but make sure you DO SOMETHING today and everyday! 

The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing. Edmund Burke

BEGIN HERE:

The media is expert at bombarding the airwaves with groundless accusations against Trump each and every time more pertinent issues surface on alternative sources. Last week the big story that was camouflaged by this smoke and mirror tactic was the one about Seth Rich, the DNC worker who was murdered in July that many in-the-know have reason to believe was the real leaker of the DNC emails to Wikileaks. Of course, if Seth Rich is revealed to be the leaker this would mean the Trump-Russian collusion scenario would vaporize. Fox's Hannity interviewed the detective investigating the case last week creating a nasty backlash that is now threatening his continued position at the FOX network. Media Matters placed pressure on Hannity's sponsors to drop his show. There are several things each and every patriot must do immediately to counter these attacks against the exposure of truth. 

1. Bring yourselves up to speed immediately on the Seth Rich story. It is a little involved so review various sources to get all the details. 

2. TELL EVERYONE you know about what you learn. Send out emails with video links attached. If you send out 10 emails request that your recipients each send out another 10. Keep a growing email list viable for followup news. 

3. Call Fox News and give your best support to Hannity asap BEFORE we have to lament another good man down! 

4. Contact your local congresspeople and senators to demand that the Seth Rich investigation be opened to the public and merged into the FBI investigation of the Russian collusion allegations that have been haunting the Trump administration. 

5. Contact your local RNC offices and ORGANIZE protest groups. Attend EVERY event. 

6. DON'T STOP. NEVER STOP.",0.0,0.0,,x9WFM53D1Hc,

Obama did the same thing Carter did when it came to international terrorism. Facilitated the rise of radicalism and opened the doors for infiltration.

I had hopes that at least race relations would improve, after all he was as white and he was black.  Nope, where he could have unified and found common ground he divided.  Race relations are further back than before his presidency.  He undermined law enforcement, refused to enforce US laws, made deals with the rest of the planet that degraded the US.  Allowed the illegal spying on reporters, enabled the attainment of nuclear weapons by unstable governments.  

The list goes on.  Truth is liberals refuse to hold him to a standard or make excuses for how or why things didn't work out.  He was a disappointment.  

Here's the worst part.  All in the name of party politics he refused to enforce rules, laws and policies on government officials. Eric Holder and ""Fast and Furious,"" Louis Lerner and the IRS, Hillary Clinton and her violations of the national security act and so on,  Huma Abedin violations of National Security Act, Anthony Weiner and Nat Sec Act, and the list does on.  

As for Trump.  I'm not a Trump guy.  Not my pick, but he is the president.   What has he actually done wrong?
