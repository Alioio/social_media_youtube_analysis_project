With the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, 197 countries agreed to set emission targets that would limit global temperature rise 1.5 degrees Celsius by capping greenhouse emissions at "net-zero" -- or absorbing as much carbon as they emit -- by 2050. So far, only two countries (Gambia and Morocco) are hitting their targets, while the biggest emitters are falling flat, or ignoring their goals entirely. How can we hold these countries accountable? Enter the Climate Action Tracker. This video was part of the Countdown Global Launch on 10.10.2020. (Watch the full event here: https://youtu.be/5dVcn8NjbwY.) Countdown is TED's global initiative to accelerate solutions to the climate crisis. The goal: to build a better future by cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030, in the race to a zero-carbon world.

In Monday’s installment, our focus is on climate change. Over the last 10 years, sea levels have risen at an alarming rate. Biodiversity is reportedly declining faster than at any time in human history, and millions of people have been affected by extreme weather, like hurricanes and floods. CBS News meteorologist and climate specialist Jeff Berardelli discusses what we expect over the next decade.

A decade ago, Professor Tim Lenton from the University of Exeter coined the phrase "planetary tipping points" to describe parts of the Earth's interconnected systems that in the past had been pushed from one state, past an irreversible point, into another. • Subscribe to ITV News on YouTube: http://bit.ly/2lOHmNj • Get breaking news and more stories at http://www.itv.com/news Follow ITV News on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/itvnews/ Follow ITV News on Twitter: https://twitter.com/itvnews Follow ITV News on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/itvnews/	Climate,Emergency,Global warming	25	News & Politics	PT4M23S	263	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XozRD4pWBMk/maxresdefault.jpg	1	8070	122	40	0

Living ecosystems like forests, mangroves, swamps and seabeds can pull enormous quantities of carbon from the air and store them safely, but natural climate solutions currently receive only 2% of the funding spent on cutting emissions. The film’s director, Tom Mustill of Gripping Films, said: 'We tried to make the film have the tiniest environmental impact possible. We took trains to Sweden to interview Greta, charged our hybrid car at George’s house, used green energy to power the edit and recycled archive footage rather than shooting new.'

Climate change is happening now, and even world leaders meeting for climate talks at this year’s Cop25 know we aren’t doing enough to stop it. In fact, we’re going backwards. The UN says carbon dioxide levels in our atmosphere are going up, and the earth is on track to warm by 3.2 degrees before the century is over. The consequences of that acceleration are already proving disastrous for communities around the world. This week’s episode of Start Here cuts through the science and the politics, to get you what you need to know about what’s at stake for the planet.

Can we humans save the planet from ourselves? In a new film, alumni Sir David Attenborough and Dr Jane Goodall DBE, and leading Cambridge University researchers, talk about the urgency of the climate crisis – and some of the solutions that will take us towards zero carbon. If we are to avoid climate disaster we must sharply reduce our carbon dioxide emissions starting today – but how? Cambridge researchers describe their work on generating and storing renewable energy, reducing energy consumption, understanding the impact of climate policies, and probing how we can each reduce our environmental impact. We hear how the ambitious new programme Cambridge Zero is bringing together ideas and innovations to tackle the global challenge of climate catastrophe – and inspiring a generation of future leaders – and how the University is looking at its own operations to develop a zero carbon pathway for the future.

The difference was so drastic in her opinion that she decided to take matters into her own hands. Greta is a 15-year-old Stockholm native who lives at home with her parents and sister Beata. She’s a 9th grader in Stockholm who enjoys spending her spare time riding Icelandic horses, spending time with her families two dogs, Moses and Roxy. She love animals and has a passion for books and science. At a young age, she became interested in the environment and convinced her family to adopt a sustainable lifestyle.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO One of the common mistakes people make about climate change is saying that it’s about “saving the planet.” But that’s not really the right way to think about it. Earth has gone through immense climate changes many times before, in some cases leading to mass species extinction. Now, we’re living through the onset of human-caused climate change, and slowing it down isn’t about saving the Earth. It’s about saving ourselves. Humans have been around for just .004% of Earth’s history. And in all of human history – the 200,000 years since our species began – we’ve had agriculture for just 5% of that time and electricity for .07% of that time. The simple truth about climate change is that it isn’t new to the planet, but civilization is. And with climate change we’re inviting a level of climate disruption that human civilization has simply never seen before.

This documentary looks at the so-called hotspots of climate change in the Sahel zone, Indonesia and the Russian Tundra. Lake Chad in the Sahel zone has already shrunk by 90 percent since the 1960s due to the increasing heat. About 40 million people will be forced to migrate to places where there is enough rainfall. Migration has always existed as a strategy to adapt to a changing environment. But the number of those forced to migrate solely because of climate change has increased dramatically since the 1990s. It is a double injustice: after becoming rich at the expense of the rest of the world, the industrialized countries are now polluting the atmosphere with their emissions and bringing a second misfortune to the inhabitants of the poorer regions. One of them is Mohammed Ibrahim: as Lake Chad got hotter and drier, he decided to go where the temperatures were less extreme and there was still a little water, trekking with his wife, children and 70 camels from Niger to Chad and then further south. The journey lasted several years and many members of his herd died of thirst. Now he and his family are living in a refugee camp: they only have seven camels left. Mohammed is one of many who have left their homelands in the Sahel - not because of conflict and crises, but because of the high temperatures. He's a real climate refugee. _______ DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines. Watch high-class documentaries from German broadcasters and international production companies.

Without me! | DW Documentary (climate change documentary)	Record heat, forest fires, drought — global warming is increasingly noticeable in Europe too. The climate crisis appears unavoidable. But most people are continuing to eat, fly and consume just as they always have. In Germany, many are talking about the need to protect the climate, but few are taking action. This report asks: can humanity still save itself? Dedicated climate activists are seeking to hold a mirror up to society through protests and blockades, resorting to drastic measures at times. Their protests may grab the headlines, but to what extent do they resonate with those attending the Cruise Days in Hamburg or the IAA motor show in Frankfurt? Then there’s always the question of how much can one person actually do to stop climate change, and how much is down to the politicians? And does banning things really help? One problem that stops effective action in Germany is the lack of public trust in politicians. In the eastern state of Thuringia, for example, citizens' initiatives were set up to protest the building of the ‘Suedlink' underground power line, designed to transport wind-generated energy from the north to supply areas in the south. It’s one of the key infrastructure projects in Germany’s planned switch to a low-carbon, nuclear-free economy. Residents along the route don’t want the landscape in their area being dug up for energy that wouldn’t benefit them personally. Clearly it’s not easy to introduce measures to stop climate change in a society with insufficient public trust and little sense of solidarity. -------------------------------------------------------------------- DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

New records continue to be set on global and European temperatures, sea levels and reduced sea ice in the Arctic. Precipitation patterns are changing, generally making wet regions in Europe wetter and dry regions drier. Glacier volume and snow cover are decreasing. At the same time, climate-related extremes such as heat waves, heavy precipitation and droughts, are increasing in frequency and intensity in many regions. Improved climate projections provide further evidence that climate-related extremes will increase in many European regions.	climate,climate change,adaptation,environment,europe,eu	28	Science & Technology	PT2M31S	151	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jS0ZIUtsQHg/maxresdefault.jpg		35516	328	40	0	27

In the year 2019 we were still pumping out around 37 billion more. That’s 50% more than the year 2000 and almost three times as much as 50 years ago. And it’s not just CO2. We’re also pumping out growing volumes of other greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide.

At the international climate conference, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterresh warned of a catastrophic impact if nations do not take action to limit their greenhouse gas emissions. Africa is already struggling with the effects of a more volatile climate. In 2019, the continent faced severe droughts, cyclones, and unusually heavy rainfall. The threats to Africa's wildlife also grew due to a changing climate.Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1 For more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/ Follow DW on social media: ►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/ ►Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews ►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dw_stories/ Für Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/channel/deutschewelle #ClimateChange #Africa	climate change,climate change africa,africa climate change,africa climate,cyclone idai,drought in afruca,drought africa,africa rainfall,global warming,hurricanes,extreme weather,extreme weather events,africa weather,weather and climate,africa wildlife,africa threats	25	News & Politics	PT12M19S	739	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8P1WG43VvgU/maxresdefault.jpg	1	21437	283	49	0	114

The country is now the world’s largest manufacturer of solar panels, lithium ion batteries, and electric vehicles. But while China has stepped up in these regards, it is still the global leader in carbon emissions, and burns more coal than the rest of the world combined. As President-elect Joe Biden looks to reassert American leadership in green energy and climate initiatives, it remains to be seen whether the U.S. and China can work collaboratively to address the climate crisis.

Subscribe to our channel here: https://goo.gl/31Q53F An investigation by Newsnight in conjunction with Greenpeace has found that the government agency, UK Export Finance (UKEF), has helped to finance oil and gas projects that, when completed, will emit 69 million tonnes of carbon a year. according to government estimates. That equates to nearly a sixth of the UK’s domestic estimated carbon emissions. This is despite a government commitment to cut down on carbon emissions. Boris Johnson has announced that the UK would no longer finance coal mining or coal-fired power plants abroad. Newsnight’s investigation found all of UKEF's current fossil fuel financing was for oil and gas projects, and not coal. It also found that - since 2010 - UKEF has financed £6bn of fossil fuel projects. Financing has been provided to some of the biggest oil and gas companies in the world. James Clayton investigates.

Governments and policymakers must take urgent action. That action is guided by what science says about the impact of climate change on the Earth. This is how it’s calculated. This is Vilhelm Bjerknes. At the end of the 19th century he devised formulas which linked the flow of heat, water and air. 50 years later his ideas were the basis of the first computer model of the atmosphere. And modern-day weather forecasting was born Today’s climate models are the highly evolved descendants of that original, except the computers are some 25trn times faster. Here’s how it works Scientists divide the Earth’s atmosphere into a grid of hundreds of thousands of cells, in stacks like a skyscraper. The model used by the Met Office, Britain’s national weather service for example, uses stacks which are 85 cells high The models then calculate how energy, air and water vapour flow through each cell over a given time period. While weather forecasting takes a snapshot of the atmosphere at a given time and predicts what will happen over the next few days Climate models consider the atmosphere’s behaviour over years and years simulating either the world as it is or the world as it might be. For all their complexity, these models have limitations. This means the models often struggle to capture details like cloud cover. And clouds play a key role in climate. As greenhouse gases make the atmosphere warmer they change the amount of water vapour it can hold and how air rises and falls. That in turn changes the amount and character of cloud cover. Depending on where clouds form, they can either trap sunlight which warms the planet, or reflect it back into space, cooling it. And some processes which govern cloud formation work on a very small scale. Dozens of these models exist, run by teams all over the world Every few years the models are brought together fed standardised questions and then their results are compared. This helps scientists understand the strengths and weaknesses of different climate models, and improves them. Of course, it’s impossible to assess the models’ future projections. But what researchers can do is compare the success of models from previous decades. A recent report compared the models from the 1970s to the 2000s. The climate models are getting increasingly complicated capturing more aspects of the Earth. But there is one element that is impossible to model. And it is the biggest contributor to climate change. Instead, scientists take simplified results from these climate models and run them through economic models. In 2013 scientists used these models to examine the effect of different climate policies on the future temperature of the planet. The first looked at what would happen if there was continued large-scale use of coal. The second, if there was continued use of fossil fuels but some use of renewable energy. The third, if there was a much higher uptake of renewable energy. And the fourth if there was a lot of use of carbon-capture technology and more land to grow biofuels. Climate models don’t predict the future and they’re not perfect. There is a long way to go before they fully represent all of Earth’s intricate processes. But for now they are the only way that scientists have of understanding how damaging an increase in carbon dioxide will be for the planet. Ultimately, the solution to climate change won’t lie inside models but rather what humans choose to do with the information they provide	The Economist,Economist,Economist Films,Economist Videos,Politics,News,short-documentary,how scientists calculate climate change,science of climate change,climate change,global warming,climate,climate science,science,global climate change,misconceptions about climate change,global warming 101,science explained,global warming short film,climate crisis,climate change short film	25	News & Politics	PT7M20S	440	2d	hd	true		1	73558	1878	82	0	349

And while there’s little doubt that climate change is to blame, proving that fault for specific weather events hasn’t really been possible… until now. » Subscribe to Seeker! http://bit.ly/subscribeseeker » Watch more Elements! http://bit.ly/ElementsPlaylist » Visit our shop at http://shop.seeker.com An emerging field called extreme-event attribution is helping us measure and verify the relationship between the climate crisis and extreme weather. Not only does this have huge implications for predicting and modeling our planet’s future, but it could also help us better prepare for living in an increasingly extreme world. When we talk about the impacts of the climate crisis, we’re really talking about distinguishing the influence of natural factors from anthropogenic factors on Earth’s climate cycle. Basically, this means teasing apart Earth’s natural climate cycles from human-caused climate change. A way to begin doing this is to examine the “fingerprints” we humans have left behind on Earth’s climate. By matching both the observed and modeled patterns of Earth’s climate, scientists can positively identify the “fingerprints'' associated with these changes. Following the tracks of these fingerprints has helped scientists link climate change with more general trends, like rising sea levels and global temperatures. #climatechange #environment #naturaldisasters #weather #science #seeker #elements Read More: The Decade of Attribution Science https://slate.com/technology/2019/12/attribution-science-field-explosion-2010s-climate-change.html "Just as medical researchers can study how smoking cigarettes changes people’s risk of lung cancer by comparing data from smokers and nonsmokers, attribution scientists compare events on our planet with those on a hypothetical “Planet B,” one that is untouched by greenhouse gas emissions."

Donald Trump vs Joe Biden: Is 2020 a Climate Change Election? Be one of the first 200 people to sign up with this link and get 20% off your subscription with Brilliant.org! https://brilliant.org/OCC With the final Donald Trump vs Joe Biden presidential debate wrapped up and the 2020 election drawing near, this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay video looks at what's at stake for climate change when the choice is between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Joe Biden's climate change plan is a surprisingly progressive agenda. Climate justice and climate mitigation are headliners of Joe Biden's climate plan, and the Green New Deal is even mentioned in Biden's climate plan. Compared to Joe Biden, Donald Trump has no climate plan, and a Donald Trump presidency could spell climate change disaster. The Trump White House has spent the last year dismantling countless pieces of environmental and climate change legislation. Unfortunately U.S. election system really only provides two choices: Donald Trump vs Joe Biden. And in this 2020 election, where climate change is a crucial issue, voting for Joe Biden is the better vote for climate action.

Consequently, encouraging human ingenuity and individual action in order to protect our world. Dr James Rae is a climate scientist in the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University of St Andrews. His research uses the chemistry of sediments, ice, and fossils to reconstruct past climate change. He’s particularly interested in the drivers of the ice ages, the climates of the dinosaurs, and reconstructing CO2 over geological time. Before coming to St Andrews, James held a prestigious NOAA Climate and Global Change fellowship at Caltech, and studied at the Universities of Bristol and Oxford. In 2015, James won the European Geosciences Union Outstanding Young Scientist Award in Biogeochemistry, for his contributions to understanding past climate change and its causes. When not in his lab in the Purdie Building, you can find him running, surfing, or biking in the Scottish great outdoors, and occasionally playing the bagpipes. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

The coronavirus pandemic has led to a huge reduction in pollution and greenhouse gases in some regions as economic activity is suspended to prevent the spread of the disease. But not all environmentalists are optimistic about what this could mean for the future of our planet. Even though CO2 emissions have slowed worldwide due to coronavirus restrictions, environmentalists fear a spike in waste from protective equipment - which often ends up in the world's oceans and seas.

But, in fact, to stop the climate crisis, we first have to dismantle the systems of oppression that caused it. Jamie Margolin is an activist, student, author, and co-founder of the youth climate justice movement Zero Hour, which mobilizes young people all over the world for emergency climate action. Her activism is rooted in her love of both the American Pacific Northwest, where she grew up, and the wilderness of her mother's home country, Colombia, both of which are deteriorating due to human causes. Her identity as a queer, Jewish, Latina motivates her to fight for the marginalized and get to the root of the problems that hold down our world.

Over and over again. And far too many leaders have refused to listen. And far too few have acted with the vision the science demands.” He said noted that “as climate change intensifies, we will find it harder to feed ourselves” causing “more and more people will be forced to migrate from their homes as the land they depend on becomes less able to support them.” He added that “this is already leading to local conflicts over dwindling resources.” Guterres called on governments, businesses, scientists and that will put the planet on a path to a better future. He said “the commitments made so far by Parties to the Paris Agreement represent just one-third of what is needed. The mountain in front of us is very high. But it is not insurmountable. We know how to scale it. Put simply, we need to put the brake on deadly greenhouse gas emissions and drive climate action.” Guterres also outlined his vision for a new Climate Summit in 2019, which he will be convening to rally the international community, to step up action in key areas inclusive sustainable energy production, economic growth, green investment and better stewardship of natural resources. He said, “enormous benefits await humankind if we can rise to the climate challenge” and added that the argument that tackling climate change is expensive and could harm economic growth “is hogwash.” In fact, he said “the opposite is true.” The call for greater ambition on climate action comes amid record temperature rises and extreme weather events across the globe. The last few months alone saw devastating floods in southern India, wildfires in the United States and extreme heatwaves in Japan. Guterres said, “we stand at an existential crossroad. If we are to take the right path – the only sensible path -- we will have to muster the full force of human ingenuity” and stressed that “technology is on our side in the battle to address climate change.” He pointed out that “the transition to a cleaner, greener future needs to speed up” and said that infrastructure investment must be “sustainable or we will lock in a high-polluting dangerous future.” Guterres said “every day we fail to act is a day that we step a little closer towards a fate that none of us wants -- a fate that will resonate through generations in the damage done to humankind and life on earth. Our fate is in our own hands. The world is counting on all of us to rise to the challenge before it’s too late.” When world leaders signed the historic Paris Agreement on climate change in 2015, they pledged to stop temperatures rising by more than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and as close to 1.5 degrees, as possible. But scientists and a major UN study, indicate that the target is already well off-track. The UN chief’s message also comes ahead of the Global Climate Action Summit, to be held on the west coast of the United States, in San Francisco, from 12-14 September. National, regional and municipal leaders will gather with business people and philanthropic communities to underscore their commitment to climate action.

The Climate Action Tracker group looked at new climate promises from China and other nations, along with the carbon plans of US President-elect Joe Biden. These commitments would mean the rise in world temperatures could be held to 2.1C by the end of this century. Previous estimates indicated up to 3C of heating, with disastrous impacts. But the experts are worried the long-term optimism is not matched by short-term plans to cut CO2.

This report has been prepared for the UK Government by the Adaptation Sub-Committee of the Committee on Climate Change. www.theccc.org.uk/uk-climate-change-risk-assessment-2017 Script Climate change is a global problem. The world is already around a degree warmer than it was, due to extra greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from human activity. Scientists have warned for some time that a temperature rise of two degrees or more risks severe and potentially irreversible changes to our planet. 2016 is set to be the warmest year ever recorded. If so, it will be the third record warmest year in a row. Last year’s historic Paris Agreement was an important step towards tackling this. But the effects of climate change are already being felt in the UK. Average temperatures are increasing and there is a trend towards milder winters and hotter summers. We can also expect more frequent floods, like those we’ve seen in recent years. And there are plenty of other challenges on the horizon. Which is why the Committee on Climate Change has carried out a comprehensive, scientific assessment of the risks and opportunities for the UK. The climate change risk assessment is the result of more than three years of work, involving hundreds of leading scientists, and experts from both the public and private sectors. It shows that the greatest threats to the UK come from periods of too much or too little water, increasing average and extreme seasonal temperatures, and rising sea levels. Action is needed to tackle six key risks: The increasing chance of more severe and widespread flooding. Risks to public health from higher temperatures, including in overheating homes. A risk of shortages in public water supplies, and scarce water for farming. A threat to nature including loss of native species. Food price spikes and potential disruption to UK and global food production. And risks from new and emerging pests and diseases affecting people, animals and plants. The longer action is delayed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and adapt to the changes, the higher the costs and risks will be. Climate change is happening now. This new UK risk assessment identifies where more effort is necessary, and urgent, to address these risks. It’s time to act.	climate change,UK,climate risks,greenhouse gases,adaptation,flooding,drought,overheating,pests,diseases,food,farming,health,infrastructure,business,industry,Paris,UNFCCC,water	28	Science & Technology	PT2M31S	151	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SDxmlvGiV9k/maxresdefault.jpg		36267			0

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab Our consumption habits emit billions of tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Our diets account for one-fourth of those emissions. The food we eat emits so many greenhouse emissions because of the land it takes to grow it, but it also has something to do with biology. This video explains why the production of some foods emit more than others, and which foods to avoid to be a more climate-conscious consumer.

According to one estimate, natural disasters caused about $340 billion in damage across the world in 2017. And insurers had to pay out a record $138 billion. The $5 trillion global insurance industry plays a huge role in the U.S. economy. Insurance spending in 2017 made up about 11 percent of America’s GDP. So, how will insurance companies remain profitable in an era of climate change? And what does that mean for the rest of us? Natural disasters cost the country $91 billion in 2018, according to a new report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The report's findings are a sign that the changing climate and increasing numbers of extreme weather events are having a significant economic impact, even as the Trump administration continues to undo Obama-era climate regulations. The economic losses in 2018 were due to 14 different natural disasters, ranging from hurricanes to wildfires to winter storms. Eighty percent, or $73 billion, of the total loss was attributable to just three events: Hurricane Michael in Florida, Hurricane Florence in the Carolinas, and wildfires in the West, including California. According to the report, 2018 had the fourth-highest total costs from natural disasters since NOAA started tracking this data in 1980. It also marked the eighth consecutive year with eight or more natural disasters that cost at least $1 billion each. Last year set a new record for wildfire costs, with $24 billion in losses caused by several fires throughout the summer and fall. November's Camp Fire burned over 150,000 acres in northern California alone, destroying homes and businesses. Since 1980, the U.S. has sustained over $1.6 trillion in losses due to natural disasters. The Trump administration has been historically resistant to take action on climate change. President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement during his first year in office. The president has dismissed reports on the effects of climate change and mocked the concept of global warming during recent winter storms. "Large parts of the Country are suffering from tremendous amounts of snow and near record setting cold," Trump tweeted last month. "Wouldn't be bad to have a little of that good old fashioned Global Warming right now!" » Subscribe to CNBC: http://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC About CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

"You have stolen my childhood and my dreams with your empty words," Thunberg said at the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York. "You're failing us, but young people are starting to understand your betrayal. The eyes of all future generations are upon you. And if you choose to fail us, I say we will never forgive you," she added. Thunberg traveled to the U.S. by sailboat last month so she could appear at the summit. She and other youth activists led international climate strikes on Friday in an attempt to garner awareness ahead of the UN's meeting of political and business leaders.

How has coronavirus impacted climate change? Can methods used to track climate change be used to track the spread of coronavirus? We explore these topics and a lot more. Our first guest is Gavin Schmidt, PhD, Director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies. To start, we get a little background on CO2 emissions. How has the air quality changed over the current quarantined period? You’ll learn how the decrease of car and air travel have impacted our climate. We explore how climate modeling is similar to modeling the spread of coronavirus. You’ll also learn the benefits of “simple” vs “complex” modeling. Gavin tells us why models are fundamental to scientific enterprise. Then we welcome our second guest, Katharine Hayhoe, PhD, director of the Climate Center at Texas Tech University. She also has her own YouTube channel called @Global Weirding with Katharine Hayhoe. Katharine explains how coronavirus made the jump from animals to humans (zoonosis) and why this is not the first, or last, time it will happen. You’ll hear why the current pandemic is like a microcosm of climate change. We investigate the role that government has played in this pandemic so far and what governments can learn from dealing with this situation. Katharine explains how this pandemic and climate change are similar in the fact that they both impact the poorest people the hardest. We take a look at the spread of conspiracy theories during this pandemic and how they come from the same places that spread climate change conspiracies. Lastly, you’ll also hear about climatefeedback.org, a website run by a network of scientists to bring you truthful climate change news. All that, plus, Katharine shares a hopeful message for the future. =================================== About the prints that flank Neil in this video: "Black Swan” & "White Swan" limited edition serigraph prints by Coast Salish artist Jane Kwatleematt Marston.

Sea temperatures in 2019 were the highest on record. Oceans are the clearest measure of climate change, since they absorb 90 per cent of the world's heat. Warmer seas mean more intense storms, droughts, floods and wildfires. The study is the latest warning on the climate crisis facing our planet. However, greenhouse gas emissions are still at record levels. Are we starting to tune out to the constant stream of bad news on the climate? If so, how should we change the conversation?

Help me make more videos like this via Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/OurChangingClimate In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at how we’ve responded globally to the Coronavirus in order to understand how we should and could respond to climate change. Specifically, I look at how countries like China, South Korea, Singapore, Italy, and the United States have quickly mounted large governmental responses to the coronavirus. Covid-19 is a serious global and political crisis, but the coronavirus shows us that rapid behavioral and structural change is possible in the face of a crisis, and climate change is a crisis. The response to Coronavirus (Covid-19) has been quick and broad, the response to climate has been slow and small. If we treated climate change like we have Covid-19, also known as the coronavirus, we would be well on our way to zero-carbon future.

But with climate skeptics (and their allies in industry and government) thwarting conservationists’ efforts, some scientists are working to develop a back-up plan: using technology to “geoengineer” the Earth's atmosphere and reduce the impacts of climate change. But geoengineering is seen by some as a distraction from the real challenge of climate change in much of the scientific community. Critics say it's a solution that diverts attention away from the real challenge, which is finding a way for the world to drastically reduce the amount of man-made carbon that its pumping into the atmosphere. Shane Smith and Ben Anderson took an in-depth look at how this technology would work — and how effective this radical (and potentially dangerous) plan could be.

The scientists who work at this outpost in Antarctica are studying the effects of climate change -- under extreme conditions. Journalist Matthias Ebert traveled to the station to find out more about their research. The scientists are particularly concerned about the speed at which Antarctic ice is melting - and its impact on global sea levels. The researchers have also been studying a large colony of emperor penguins that lives near their facility -- to find out more about how these birds are adapting to climate change. Ebert reports on the daily lives of the scientists who work at the Neumayer Station, and how they cope with the extreme weather conditions, isolation, and cramped quarters. They've even managed to grow some of their own food in a greenhouse at the facility. Ebert documents the damaging effect that global warming is having on the Antarctic, and the risk that this poses for the rest of the world. -------------------------------------------------------------------- DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

A leading climate scientist helps sort fact from fiction and stresses the importance of adapting to an uncertain future. Linda Mortsch has devoted her career to addressing climate change issues. Since 1989, she has played a role in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and is a co-recipient of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize. In 1992, her research project “Adapting to climate variability and change in the Great Lakes Basin” was one of the first to explore adaptation to climate change in Canada. Today, Linda has an adjunct appointment in the Faculty of Environment at the University of Waterloo, and has been recognized by a number of associations, including the International Joint Commission, American Geophysical Union, Environment Canada, and more.

The current generation of high school and college-aged young adults is the first that has grown up with an awareness of climate change and its potential consequences.  How does this generation perceive climate change and its own future given that perception? How does education in climate change alter those perceptions? This talk examines the perception of climate change, its potential consequences on the future of high school students (age 16-18) before and after being educated on the evidence, and mitigation strategies of climate change. Bio: Mr. Isaac is a lifelong educator. His life path has taken him on a wild ride from working as a sailing instructor to banker; to “working” as a stay at home dad, firefighter, and EMT to finally finding and fulfilling his passion in high school science education. Strident about the education of young minds, project-based learning, and earth and space sciences, Mr. Isaac strives to get young minds to open to the amazing world around them: “Get your head out of your phone,” he admonishes them. Mr. Isaac, the oldest faculty member at South Fayette High School, has been teaching for only seven years. He enjoys the responsibility and latitude of being the old guy that never follows the rules.

But how much can trees really do to tackle global warming? See our research here: https://econ.st/32HXvXY Click here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: https://econ.st/2xvTKdy Summer 2019 - More than 38,000 fires raged across the Amazon. Fires that were man-made. Over the past 50 years almost 17% of the world’s largest rainforest has been cleared. And globally deforestation has almost doubled in just five years. Since the start of human civilisation it’s estimated that the number of trees around the world has fallen by almost half. Clearing forests increases carbon-dioxide levels but planting them could store away some of the carbon already in the atmosphere. This woman runs safaris in England. Guests are not only here to see wild animals - they’re here to see wild trees. Almost 20 years ago Isabella Tree—yes that is her real name-handed 1,400 hectares of Sussex farmland back to nature, by doing, well nothing. She thinks this is the best way to use the land to help tackle climate change. To stabilise the climate global carbon emissions need to drop to net zero by 2050. Simon Lewis is a professor of global change science. And there’s never been more global ambition to plant trees. In 2014, 51 countries pledged to plant over 3.5m square kilometres of forest by 2030 - an area slightly larger than India. The 2030 target looks likely to be met. But there’s a catch… Monoculture tree plantations like eucalyptus grow quickly but the trees are harvested every ten or so years releasing much of the carbon stored in the tree back into the atmosphere - which means that, according to some studies they’ll store only around one-fortieth of the carbon natural forests do over the long term. In fact, those pledges to plant millions of trees actually promise to store 26bn tonnes less carbon than they could. Sometimes the motives for planting forests are less green than they might appear. By 2020 Ireland ought to have cut greenhouse-gas emissions by 20% below 2005 levels. But at current rates it will have reduced them by only 5%. Planting forests might help Ireland avoid massive penalties for missing EU targets because the potential carbon these forests could store in the future can be counted as a carbon credit today. In the 1920s Ireland had the lowest forest cover in Europe at around 1%. That’s now risen to 11% and the government has set a target to cover 18% of the land with forest by 2046. And now local community groups are protesting against these monoculture tree plantations. They say they’re doing more harm than good. Tree-planting programmes invariably have an impact on the people living nearby. In east Africa one project is demonstrating what can be achieved when there’s genuine buy-in from the local communities. Green Ethiopia is a mixed-tree planting charity. The land is communally owned and co-operatives of local women receive benefits for planting trees which are protected from being harvested. Here conserving is just as important as planting. Green Ethiopia assesses whether the condition of the land is good enough to regenerate by itself. When it is—on about a third of the area the charity runs they leave it alone. Just like Isabella Tree, back in England. Monoculture plantations are often preferred because they make money. So some experts are looking to a future where carbon payments could create financial incentives for natural forests. Ultimately though, the trouble with trees tackling climate change is space For more from Economist Films visit: http://films.economist.com/ Check out The Economist’s full video catalogue: http://econ.st/20IehQk Like The Economist on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheEconomist/ Follow The Economist on Twitter: https://twitter.com/theeconomist Follow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/theeconomist/ Follow us on Medium: https://medium.com/@the_economist	The Economist,Economist,Economist Films,Economist Videos,News,short-documentary,climate change,global warming,global warming short film,climate,environment,greenhouse gases,climate change news,climate crisis,climate change solutions,planting trees,trees	25	News & Politics	PT9M45S	585	2d	hd	true	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EXkbdELr4EQ/maxresdefault.jpg	1	432142	11905	844	0	1773

The arctic has been warming up for years - and now, the warnings of experts and scientists are clear for everyone to see - the poles are melting. As the differences in temperature between the poles and the equatore reduce, the jetstream winds, which move weather around the globe - are slowing down. The result - extreme weather. High- and low pressure systems remain at the same spot for longer, creating floods and droughts.

Don't miss Vox's Game of Thrones coverage: https://www.vox.com/game-of-thrones Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO The White Walkers are some of Thrones’ creepiest villains — but they also help tell a really interesting metaphor about climate change. For starters, the White Walkers are a threat to all humanity: Their zombie minions are equally happy to rip apart people of all nations and noble houses. Yet instead of uniting to combat the shared threat to human existence, the houses in the show spend basically all their time on their own petty disagreements and struggle for power. White Walkers are generally ignored; some nobles deny their existence outright. Swap climate change for White Walkers and "countries" for noble houses, and it starts to sound a lot like the real world. Specifically, it sounds like the problem of international coordination on climate change. No one country can prevent catastrophic warming on its own: Every country that's a major greenhouse gas emitter is part of the problem.

"XR" demonstrators have staged spectacular acts of civil disobedience as part of their effort to persuade politicians to take action to reduce global warming. Extinction Rebellion was founded two years ago, and has achieved remarkable success since then. In Germany alone, there are 120 local XR groups and a total of about 20,000 members. The small town of Stroud in southwest England is considered the movement's birthplace. For years, Stroud has been a center of environmental activism in Britain and it is where the founding members live. One of them is Skeena Rathor -- a mother of three who says that she's prepared to go to jail for her beliefs. Another is Gail Bradbrook, who is not above damaging public and private property during protests. Extinction Rebellion activists have paralyzed traffic and chained themselves to fences outside businesses and government offices as part of their demonstrations. One of the co-founders of Extinction Rebellion is Roger Hallam, whose radical activism has sparked controversy. In September 2019, Hallam was arrested and charged with using drones to try to disrupt air traffic at Heathrow Airport. He's also been accused of making comments that appeared to downplay the significance of the Holocaust which led Extinction Rebellion groups in Germany and Britain to distance themselves from Hallam’s statements. XR demands that governments declare a climate- and ecological emergency, and take decisive action to protect the environment. The organization continues to recruit new members, and to prepare them for taking part in acts of non-violent civil disobedience. Extinction Rebellion appears to be politically neutral. Its supporters range from the far left to the far right. But this diversity of views could lead to potentially disruptive policy disputes. -------------------------------------------------------------------- DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Are organic farming and hydroponics the key to farming's future? SUBSCRIBE: https://goo.gl/kdDpXu Unpredictable weather patterns are forcing farmers to adopt new methods to maintain a viable business while making food production as efficient as possible. A small farm in south Dakota has turned to organic farming and invested in their dirt while others have taken climate out of the equation and invested in hydroponics, growing vegetables in large warehouses. In the last of our What Happens Next, we explore the future of food through farming.

She discusses the impacts of climate change on her home country, Honduras, and how she discovered the intersections between these two issues. Far too often we talk about the effect of climate change on the planet, and she wants to change the narrative and talk about how it will impact the most marginalized communities around the world. Adriana is a fourth year student in the Faculty of Land and Food Systems. She's originally from Honduras, in Central America and is passionate about social justice, climate change and food security. She's a member of Love Intersections, a group of queer, people of colour who believe that story telling is a powerful agent of change. She's been very involved with sustainability initiatives at UBC and currently works for AMS Sustainability.

We made this difficult decision for the TED Archive because we believe that a well-moderated conversation allows for better commentary from more people and more viewpoints. Studies show that aggressive and hateful comments silence other commenters and drive them away; unfortunately, YouTube's comment moderation tools are simply not up to the task of allowing us to monitor comments on so many videos at once.

Climate change is arguably the greatest challenge of our time. Human activity has already warmed the planet by one degree Celsius relative to pre-industrial times, and we are feeling the effects through record heat waves, droughts, wildfires and flooding. If we continue to burn fossil fuels at the current rate, the planet will reach two degrees of warming by 2050 - the threshold that many scientists have identified as a dangerous tipping point. What is the science behind these projections? Join climate scientist expert Michael Mann to learn about the basic scientific principles behind climate change and global warming. We need to understand the science in order to solve the broader environmental, societal and economic changes that climate change is bringing. By the end of this course, you will: -Develop a deep scientific understanding of HOW the climate system has been changing; -Articulate WHY the climate system is changing; -Understand the nature of these changes; -Develop a systems thinking approach to analyzing the impacts of climate change on both natural and human systems.	edX,edx.org,free online courses,free courses online,free courses,free classes,online classes,online courses free,online college courses,online college classes,free online classes,education,free education,online education,massive open online course,MOOC,MOOC courses,online learning,lifelong learning,free online learning,free university courses,MIT online courses,distance learning,distance education,certificates,free college courses,Harvard,MIT	27	Education	PT2M15S	135	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8vP00TP6-p0/maxresdefault.jpg	1	5320	78	29	0	3

Here's how we prepare | Colette Pichon Battle	Visit http://TED.com to get our entire library of TED Talks, transcripts, translations, personalized Talk recommendations and more. Scientists predict climate change will displace more than 180 million people by 2100 -- a crisis of "climate migration" the world isn't ready for, says disaster recovery lawyer and Louisiana native Colette Pichon Battle. In this passionate, lyrical talk, she urges us to radically restructure the economic and social systems that are driving climate migration -- and caused it in the first place -- and shares how we can cultivate collective resilience, better prepare before disaster strikes and advance human rights for all.

But is this power of scientific truth working for climate change? Kenneth Van den Bergh, owner of a non-profit dedicated to climate change and a researcher at the KU Leuven in the Energy & Environment group, will explore this question with you. Kenneth Van den Bergh is a co-founder of Carbon+Alt+Delete. Carbon+Alt+Delete is a non-profit organization with the mission to mitigate climate change by informing and activating people. Carbon+Alt+Delete offers a user-friendly tool to calculate carbon emissions. Besides, people can compensate their carbon emissions by supporting renewable energy projects. Kenneth holds a PhD in Mechanical Engineering, a MSc in Energy Engineering and a MSc in Management, all from the KU Leuven.

Animated film. Length: 5'42" The impacts of climate change destroy people's livelihoods and homes. They damage our infrastructure and disrupt communication and trade. Moreover, climate change is endangering development successes and the poor and marginalized are often affected the most. Even if we were to stop emissions instantly, the world would not stop warming immediately due to the amount of gases we have already emitted. That's why we must do both: reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to inevitable climate change. But how can we adapt, considering that the precise extent and form of climate change aren't known?

Academics call this "shifting baseline syndrome" -- the idea that environmental change happens too slowly to trip our alarm bells. Journalist and filmmaker John D. Sutter is directing a longitudinal film series -- BASELINE -- that aims to be an antidote by documenting four locations on the frontlines of change every five years, until 2050. John D. Sutter is an EMMY-nominated documentary filmmaker who is directing “Baseline,” a film series that tells the story of the climate crisis beyond a human lifetime. He is an Explorer with the National Geographic Society, where he is developing the “Baseline” project. Sutter spent 10 years as a reporter, columnist and producer at CNN, most recently as a senior investigative reporter. He continues to work for CNN as a climate analyst. Sutter’s work has twice been nominated for an EMMY — for science reporting and new approaches to documentary. He is the recipient of the Livingston Award for Young Journalists, the Peabody Award, the Batten Medal for Public Service, the Foreign Press Association Media Award and the Edward R. Murrow Award, among others. He’s a former fellow at Harvard’s Nieman Foundation for Journalism and at UnionDocs, a center for documentary art in Brooklyn. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Climate change is THE existential question that humanity is facing. But are we too late? Has climate change reached the point of no return? Are we doomed? TEACHERS: Get your students in the discussion on KQED Learn, a safe place for middle and high school students to investigate controversial topics and share their voices. ABOVE THE NOISE is a show that cuts through the hype and investigates the research behind controversial and trending topics in the news. Hosted by Myles Bess. *NEW VIDEOS EVERY OTHER WEDNESDAY* SUBSCRIBE by clicking the RED BUTTON above. Follow us on Instagram @kqedabovethenoise **What's the state of climate change right now?** Since around 1880, the average global temperature of the earth has increased by 1 degree Celsius, or 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit. That increase is due almost entirely to humans burning fossil fuels, mostly from 1950 on. That might not sound like a big increase, but it is. It means sea level rise, shrinking polar ice caps, and increased extreme weather events like heat waves and monsoons. That's why a hundred and ninety-plus countries signed onto the Paris Climate Agreement. The goal is to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius -- or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit -- by the end of this century. Many scientists say that staying under 1.5 puts us near the upper limit of what's tolerable. We'll have droughts, sea level rise, and extreme weather, but chances are we can manage it. **What does climate change look like in the future?** That's why we have the IPCC. The IPCC is part of the United Nations, and it stands for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. It's been the world's top authority on climate science for the last 30 years. Thousands of climate scientists from around the world volunteer their time to analyze and summarize the latest and best climate science. According to these experts, if we keep burning fossil fuels like we are today, then we're blowing past 1.5 degrees of warming by 2100. We'll almost definitely hit 2 degrees, and might even reach 3 or even 4 degrees. That means longer and more intense heat waves. And stronger hurricanes and dangerous flooding. **How do we get climate change under control?** Let's start with transportation. 95% of the vehicles on the planet burn fossil fuels. They're responsible for almost ⅓ of all greenhouse gas emissions worldwide! It might sound like a pipe-dream to replace those gas-guzzlers with electric vehicles, but it might not be. In the last decade and a half electric vehicles that don't have any pollution out of the tailpipe went from a dream to commonplace in places like California, China, Norway. Then we have the energy sector -- think power plants. In 2016, 80% of the world's energy came from fossil fuels, while only 5% came from renewables like solar and wind. But we're seeing that change. Now solar is the cheapest form of energy in just two decades. That's a huge change. And then there's how we use land. We're cutting down WAY too many trees and using a lot of that land to raise livestock that we end up eating. The United Nations estimates that if the world stopped getting food from animal sources, greenhouse gas emissions could be cut by one-fourth. SOURCES: Climate Change: How Do We Know?

Be one of the first 200 people to sign up with this link and get 20% off your subscription with Brilliant.org! https://brilliant.org/OCC/ In this Our Changing Climate environmental video essay, I look at what you can do about climate change using individual, personal, and collective actions. This video, however, is not a simple list of the best things a person can do to change their lifestyle and shrink their carbon footprint, instead I start by looking at the way in which we’ve globally become fixated on individual solutions to climate change. We envision ourselves more as consumers than as citizens. As a result carbon footprint related actions like flying less, zero waste, and recycling are prioritized over voting, protesting, and system change. This video is all about doing both personal things to lower your carbon footprint like driving less, but simultaneously acting collectively to create a system in which having a small carbon footprint is feasible for everyone. Structural change and individual change are both necessary to stop climate change.

In August 2018, dismayed by adults’ lack of action on the global climate crisis, the teenager sat herself down in front of the Swedish Parliament, pledging to strike from school every Friday until Sweden aligned its policies with the Paris Agreement. Greta’s actions have earned her a Nobel Peace Prize nomination and speaking engagements at the World Economic Forum and COP24—but most importantly, they’ve encouraged students from all over the globe to stand up for Earth and their futures.

I am 15 years old. I am from Sweden. I speak on behalf of Climate Justice Now. Many people say that Sweden is just a small country and it doesn't matter what we do. But I've learned you are never too small to make a difference. And if a few children can get headlines all over the world just by not going to school, then imagine what we could all do together if we really wanted to. But to do that, we have to speak clearly, no matter how uncomfortable that may be. You only speak of green eternal economic growth because you are too scared of being unpopular. You only talk about moving forward with the same bad ideas that got us into this mess, even when the only sensible thing to do is pull the emergency brake. You are not mature enough to tell it like is. Even that burden you leave to us children. But I don't care about being popular. I care about climate justice and the living planet. Our civilization is being sacrificed for the opportunity of a very small number of people to continue making enormous amounts of money. Our biosphere is being sacrificed so that rich people in countries like mine can live in luxury. It is the sufferings of the many which pay for the luxuries of the few. The year 2078, I will celebrate my 75th birthday. If I have children maybe they will spend that day with me. Maybe they will ask me about you. Maybe they will ask why you didn't do anything while there still was time to act. You say you love your children above all else, and yet you are stealing their future in front of their very eyes. Until you start focusing on what needs to be done rather than what is politically possible, there is no hope. We cannot solve a crisis without treating it as a crisis. We need to keep the fossil fuels in the ground, and we need to focus on equity. And if solutions within the system are so impossible to find, maybe we should change the system itself. We have not come here to beg world leaders to care. You have ignored us in the past and you will ignore us again. We have run out of excuses and we are running out of time. We have come here to let you know that change is coming, whether you like it or not. The real power belongs to the people.

Written, directed and animated by Miritte Ben Yitzchak and voiced by British actress Keira Knightley, it urges us all to Act Now before it is too late. The animated short Climate Crisis, and Why We Should Panic, is the second of a two-part explainer video series for Extinction Rebellion, focusing on the climate and ecological crisis. Voiced by Keira Knightley, it explains what’s causing climate change, why governments must enter crisis mode to tackle this issue, and what will happen if we don’t do something about it now. It follows the first part - Extinction Emergency, and Why We Must Act Now - which focuses on the ecological crisis. Voiced by Naomie Harris and scored by Brian Eno, it summarises the planet’s biodiversity loss, runaway consumerism and the ecological crisis that now faces us, and how the consequences will affect millions of lives around the world.

Trees are burning up around the planet at an alarming rate and impacting the climate. Now a new effort to plant as many trees as possible has taken hold around the globe. But will it mitigate climate change? In California, 3 million acres have burned since 2017. And in Brazil, some 121,000 fires have burned since January — more than half in the Amazon rainforest. The fires have cost the planet millions of trees, one of the Earth’s best defenses against climate change. Now a movement around the globe is trying to replace trees lost to fire and deforestation for agriculture or grazing. In Ethiopia, the prime minister announced a new #GreenLegacy initiative that planted more than 353 million trees in 12 hours. Even YouTube stars are getting in on the act: More than 600 social media personalities recently raised over $16 million to plant trees worldwide. The effort was led by Jimmy Donaldson, a YouTube star who’s also known as MrBeast. Reforestation is also a big part of the Paris climate agreement, which the U.S. recently abandoned at the behest of President Donald Trump. But can planting billions and billions of trees really mitigate climate change? For that matter, is it even feasible? » Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC » Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision » Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic About CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

As our case is new so we must think anew and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves and then we shall save our country.” He was speaking before the US Congress to confront the defining issue of his time – slavery. Everyone knew it had to end but no one had the political will to stop it. Remarkably, his words ring as true today when applied to the defining crisis of our time – Climate Change. As a UN Messenger of Peace, I have traveled all over the world for the last two years documenting how this crisis is changing the natural balance of our planet. I have seen cities like Beijing choked by industrial pollution. Ancient Boreal forests in Canada that have been clear cut and rainforests in Indonesia that have been incinerated. In India, I met farmers whose crops have literally been washed away by historic flooding. In America, I have witnessed unprecedented droughts in California and sea level rise flooding the streets of Miami. In Greenland and in the Arctic I was astonished to see that ancient glaciers are rapidly disappearing well ahead of scientific predictions. All that I have seen and learned on this journey has absolutely terrified me. There is no doubt in the world’s scientific community that this a direct result of human activity and that the effects of climate change will become astronomically worse in the future. You know that climate change is happening faster than even the most pessimistic of scientists warned us decades ago. It has become a runaway freight train bringing with it an impending disaster for all living things. Now think about the shame that each of us will carry when our children and grandchildren look back and realize that we had the means of stopping this devastation, but simply lacked the political will to do so. Our planet cannot be saved unless we leave fossil fuels in the ground where they belong. Massive change is required, now. One that leads to a new collective consciousness. A new collective evolution of the human race, inspired and enabled by a sense of urgency from all of you. We all know that reversing the course of climate change will not be easy, but the tools are in our hands – if we apply them before it is too late. Now is the time for bold unprecedented action. It is time to ask each other – which side of history will you be on? As a citizen of our planet, it is time to declare no more talk. No more excuses. No more ten-year studies. No more allowing the fossil fuel companies to manipulate and dictate the science and policies that affect our future. Lincoln’s words still resonate to all of us here today:“We will be remembered in spite of ourselves. The fiery trial through which we pass will light us down, in honor or dishonor, to the last generation… We shall nobly save, or meanly lose, the last best hope of earth.” That is our charge now – you are the last best hope of Earth. We ask you to protect it. Or we – and all living things we cherish – are history." - Leonardo DiCaprio ► For more Inspirational Videos: http://blog.goalcast.life/epic-motivational-videos/ ► Subscribe To Our Channel Here: https://goo.gl/wTKGC4 Don't forget to share this video to spread the inspiration! ========================================­­­­­­­======== FOLLOW US: Facebook: https://goo.gl/cjShXM Instagram: https://goo.gl/XaukHK Twitter: https://goo.gl/WBe30b Website: http://www.goalcast.life ========================================­­­­­­­======== BACKGROUND MUSIC by Fearless Motivation Instrumentals: AppleMusic/iTunes: https://goo.gl/2mF7gr Spotify: https://goo.gl/Uxmswh AmazonMP3: http://geni.us/BackgroundMusic MP3 Downloads: https://teamfearless.com/mp3-downloads/background-music/	motivation,inspirational,quotes,motivational speech,motivational quotes,leonardo Dicaprio,climate change,green,global warming	24	Entertainment	PT3M53S	233	2d	hd	true	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F47RIF_0reA/maxresdefault.jpg	1	176944	2945	73	0	172

It's a weather cycle that's prompted a number of climate change deniers — including President Trump — to crack tired jokes about the concept of global warming. But beyond the misguided social media jabs lies a serious and ongoing discussion about how scientists can connect individual extreme weather events to underlying climate change — and more importantly, how fast they can make now those connections. Remember that study from 2004? It looked at a European heat wave that took place in 2003, and took a year and a half to complete. In contrast, just three months after Hurricane Harvey, scientists at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory published a study showing that Harvey dropped 38 percent more rain than it would have without underlying climate change. Another group called World Weather Attribution found that hurricanes that size have become three times more probable VICE News spoke with Myles Allen, a climate scientist at the University of Oxford and one of the researchers behind the first climate attribution study, who explained why scientists are now able to rapidly figure out if an event like Hurricane Harvey was more devastating than it otherwise would have been because of climate change. (Answer: it was.) "We are now looking at accelerating that whole process because once you've agreed on the method you're using, you don't need to reinvent the wheel every time you do a new study," Allen told VICE News. "The actual time it takes to actually do the calculations is not that long." This segment originally aired January 3, 2018 on VICE News Tonight on HBO.

On the heels of a climate-focused World Economic Forum in Davos, the unveiling of Europe’s new Green Deal, and increased attention on climate change by the world’s largest asset managers and banks, climate change is undoubtedly "Top of Mind." We speak with Michael Greenstone of the University of Chicago, Nathaniel Keohane of the Environmental Defense Fund and Goldman Sachs’ Steve Strongin about the climate challenge, and what it will take to address it. We also discuss how capital markets and climate policy are driving transformational shifts in the energy industry, and what it means for sector returns. Finally, the head of the Goldman Sachs Sustainable Finance Group, John Goldstein, provides insight and advice on ESG investing and integration, and the growing implications of shareholders and clients increasingly demanding more accountability on climate.

How could spraying chemicals into the stratosphere help counteract global warming? Click here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: http://econ.trib.al/rWl91R7 What if you discovered a way to cool down the planet? Extreme weather events are becoming more common and more ferocious. As the surface temperature of earth continues to rise, so too will the ferocity of natural disasters. In 2018 scientists will take bold steps to explore a technology that could reverse the effects of climate-change. They’re looking at ways to reflect sunlight back into space and cool down the planet. Insurers say the number of weather-related disasters has quadrupled since 1970. While world leaders are debating and disputing climate-change and the ways in which humans alter their behaviour on earth, some scientists discuss changes to the earth itself. In 2018, they’ll take to the stratosphere to learn what it might take – or cost – to cool the planet directly. Geoengineering is the pioneering science that could well be on everyone’s lips in 2018. The team from Harvard University is the first in the world to test the effects solar geoengineering might have in the stratosphere. The experiments in 2018 won’t impact the climate, but if one day implemented, this controversial intervention could help curb extreme weather events. Solar geoengineering has the potential to save lives, but it also poses unknown risks. And there are fears that merely researching geoengineering might be detrimental to the long-term fight against climate-change. Some environmentalists say that the drive to reduce carbon dioxide emissions could be lost if there’s seen to be a quick fix. And deciding who controls a technology that affects everyone on the planet won’t be easy. Ultimately solar geoengineering could prove a risk not worth taking. But ignoring it now could be even more dangerous. Daily Watch: mind-stretching short films throughout the working week.

We reached that goal in April 2020, and we’re certainly proud that our facilities, corporate emissions, and corporate travel don’t contribute carbon to the planet. We use 100 percent renewable electricity, and we’ve invested in the restoration of forests, wetlands, and grasslands to remove carbon naturally. However, all of this is just a starting point. We have an entirely different goal in mind. It’s kind of an audacious plan. By 2030 our whole carbon footprint — from manufacturing to transportation to end-of-life material recovery — will be nonexistent. All of Apple will be 100 percent carbon neutral. To do that, we’ll be using renewable energy and recycled materials throughout our supply chain. We’ll be restoring natural ecosystems around the world. And we’ll reuse as much as we can. While designing the world’s most innovative products, we’re also designing a sustainable manufacturing process. To really get to carbon zero while making products people all over the world love — a lot of people might say that’s impossible. We say it won’t be. Keep an eye on us and see.

India has witnessed droughts, floods, low yields, high temperature, erratic rains. But are we responsible for it? Or are we victims, paying the price for the development trajectory of other rich countries? Is it fair to ask India to cut its greenhouse gas emissions, which may come at the cost of development? Or is there a way to bridge the development and environment binary? How has India’s international stance evolved? To discuss a range of these issues, Navroz Dubash, editor of the most comprehensive book on climate change and India, joins this edition of The Big Picture.

Is There a Cure? | Jonathan Patz | TEDxOshkosh	Public health is being impacted by climate change via many pathways - from alterations in infectious disease transmission to water-source compromise, malnutrition, air pollution, and other factors. This talk includes recent analyses that show how mitigating global warming provides extensive health opportunities, as well as major savings in healthcare costs. Jonathan Patz, MD, MPH, is Professor & John P. Holton Chair in Health and the Environment at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where he also directs the Global Health Institute. He co-chaired the health expert panel of the first Congressionally mandated US National Assessment on Climate Change and was a convening lead author for the international Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. For 14 years, Patz was a lead author for the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) – co-recipient of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize. Patz is the author of nearly 100 peer-reviewed papers plus multiple reports, two co-edited textbooks and an encyclopedia on global environmental health This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

But humans aren't actually contributing as significantly as you may think to global warming. In fact, the vast majority of the world's population lives a relatively low-carbon emission lifestyle compared to "the developed world". Yet, ironically, the world's poorest citizens are the ones most likely to be impacted by the potential byproducts of a warmer planet. In this video, let's explore the economic impacts of climate change – both in terms of its potential consequences and the feasibility of available solutions. ▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀ 📚 Want to learn more about the economics of climate change?

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO We know that humanity's carbon footprint has shifted the baseline conditions of the climate, the context in which every weather event takes place. But trying to isolate the human influence from everything else that is going on can be really hard, especially for hurricanes, or what scientists call "tropical cyclones." They're super complex and the quality of the historical data we have for them isn't great. We do have physics, though. Hurricanes are driven by the transfer of heat from the sea to the air through evaporation. The storm's maximum possible wind speed, or its potential intensity, depends in part on how warm the ocean is – and of course, we're warming the ocean. So researchers expect intense tropical cyclones to become frequent if we continue to warm the planet. The hurricanes of the future will also be wetter. So coastal cities will face freshwater flooding from the sky paired with storm surge from the sea, which is higher now because we are also causing sea levels to rise. And that trend of wetter storms isn't just for hurricanes. Heavy precipitation events from other types of storms have been increasing in The US and should continue to increase across the country. Even in places that might see less rain over the whole year, they'll get more days with really heavy precipitation. This comes down to basic physics too: warmer air can take up more water before it dumps it back down on us. All of this means global warming worsens floods like the kind that hit Houston. But it's not our destiny to hurt ourselves like this. It depends on what we choose to do now. We could rethink our infrastructure and regulations to minimize the damage, but unless we also start cutting our carbon emissions and shifting the world to clean energy, it's just going to get worse.

According to Chomsky, this massive public relations campaign has succeeded in leading a good portion of the population into doubting the human causes of global warming. Known for his criticism of the media, Chomsky doesn't hold back in this clip, laying blame on mainstream media outlets such as the New York Times, which will run frontpage articles on what meteorologists think about global warming. "Meteorologists are pretty faces reading scripts telling you whether it's going to rain tomorrow," Chomsky says. "What do they have to say any more than your barber?" All this is part of the media's pursuit of "fabled objectivity." Of particular concern for Chomsky is the atmosphere of anger, fear and hostility that currently reigns in America. The public's hatred of Democrats, Republicans, big business and banks and the public's distrust of scientists all lead to general disregard for the findings of "pointy-headed elitists." The 2010 elections could be interpreted as a "death knell for the species" because most of the new Republicans in Congress are global warming deniers. "If this was happening in some small country," Chomsky concludes, "it wouldn't matter much. But when it's happening in the richest, most powerful country in the world, it's a danger to the survival of the species."

Floods, cyclones and droughts are likely to increase as the Earth warms. Poor farmers are already trying to adapt. Click here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: http://econ.st/2Hea5EK Melting glaciers, droughts, rising sea-levels - these are just some of the environmental disruptions that are likely to worsen with climate change. But dangerous climate change is not just something that might happen in the future. The earth is already warmed by almost 1 degree Celsius since the dawn of the Industrial Age - the effects are already being felt now. Vulnerable communities are trying to adapt. Bangladesh is more at risk from climate change than almost any other country. It's prone to flooding, cyclones and drought. Climate change may already be exacerbating those things. Bangladesh sits at the bottom of a Delta plane were three main rivers converge. It's straddled by the melting Himalayan glaciers in the north and the rising waters of the Bay of Bengal in the south. That makes it highly susceptible to flooding. In 2009, cyclone Aila tore through Bangladesh, uprooting trees, flattening homes and destroying crops. Along the southern coastal regions the storm left behind salty water in areas it had inundated. Fields that had once support agriculture were deemed useless. To adapt to their newly saline environment, locals have had to change their source of food production. Through a project funded by the World Bank villagers have switched to raising crabs which thrive in saltwater. Villagers rear the crabs and sell them at a local market where they're then resold by buyers who shipped them to Dakha. Adding to this problem, in some areas farmers deliberately inundate their lands with salty water so they can farm shrimp rather than crops, which is more profitable but problematic for the environment. But the salinity creates another daunting problem - it pollutes local groundwater and makes it more difficult to access safe drinking water. Climate change is worsening this effect. Cyclones are more common, river flow has diminished, and salty water from the Bay of Bengal has been reaching ever farther into the coastal lands travelling up rivers and polluting freshwater supplies that are used for drinking and irrigation. NGOs working with the Community Climate Change Project has sought to address this problem. They've provided water tanks so locals can harvest rainwater and have helped fund a desalination plant that provides clean drinking water. In the north of the country, local livelihoods have also been threatened by water. Many villagers are beholden to the rivers. When the rivers flood, the soil used for agriculture has disappeared. Not only have they lost their homes and their crops but also their means of survival. In Ranpur, villagers have learned a new farming technique that works on sandbars or chars where all the soil has been eroded. Farmers dig out holes in the char fill them with compost and plant pumpkins. Pumpkins are preserved and can be sold during the rainy season providing income throughout the year. Adaptation projects such as the ones being carried out in Bangladesh have had a huge impact on those involved but Bangladesh is not the only place where the effects of climate change are already being felt and adapted to. Rotterdam is building floating pavilions to pilot a city that rises with its sea levels. London will improve the Thames Barrier so it can better protect the city from floods. A decade ago adaptation was almost taboo in international discussions about climate change because it was believed to distract attention from the vital task of stopping global warming altogether. Now those are recognized as important. But can keep them in poor countries like Bangladesh adapt quickly enough? We don't know yet. Richer countries are better able to withstand the potential shocks that climate change will bring. If change is slow enough, it gives people more time to act and increases the odds of success. World leaders tend to talk about stopping climate change. It would help poor farmers enormously if it could only be slowed down. Daily Watch: mind-stretching short films throughout the working week.

He’s not afraid of gang violence or political persecution, like many migrants who would claim asylum in the U.S. He’s worried about rain — and the lack of it.

Will water become the habitat of the future? Visionary projects for a life with the tides are forging ahead worldwide. Experts forecast that by 2100, sea levels will be two meters higher than they are today. This could force 40 percent of the world’s population out of their homes, for example, in Mumbai, Tokyo, Guangzhou or Bangladesh. The US won’t be spared either. Miami, New Orleans and New York would also have to be evacuated. Entire city districts would be under water. Climate change would drastically alter our metropolitan areas. That's why ideas that originated in science fiction have now becoming reality. Floating and underwater buildings could become places of refuge. What sounds like a utopia is soon to become reality. The first pioneers are already living in floating neighborhoods. Could the South Pacific paradise of Tahiti also be saved in this way? This is still all tantalizing luxury. Visionary hotel operators offer rooms with an underwater view. Or dinner during which fish and marine life are a feature in floating restaurants. Many of these futuristic plans involve water. Will we be farming on the sea? Will the "SeaOrbiter” floating research station designed by Parisian architect Jacques Rougerie get underway soon? Or will we walk through seaports on floating boulevards? ------------------------------------------------------------------ DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Sandstorms are becoming more and more frequent, groundwater levels are sinking and palm trees are shrivelling up and dying. An age-old way of life is in danger. Halim Sbai says an oasis really is a paradise. But drought and desertification are now taking their toll on oases like M'hamid El Ghizlane in southeastern Morocco where he grew up. The survival of a whole region is at stake. Over hundreds of kilometers between the Anti-Atlas mountains and the Sahara desert there is one palm-fringed oasis after the next. Close to two million people live in these settlements. Up to now, many earned their living by harvesting dates from the palm trees. But this is proving more and more difficult. Decreasing and irregular rainfall is having a devastating impact on the trees and their yields. Halim Sbai is planting new palm trees and preserving as much precious water as he can in a bid to keep the oasis of M'hamid El Ghizlane and the region’s traditional way of life alive. Up to now, he has also been supplementing his income with earnings from tourism. Global warming could put an end to all this. ------------------------------------------------------------------- DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

In reality, 97 percent of scientists agree that it is real and only 3 percent are skeptical. A sticking point for some is the estimated timeline, but as Columbia University professor Philip Kitcher points out, a 4-5 Celsius temperature increase that makes the planet uninhabitable is a disaster no matter when it happens. In this video, 9 experts (including professors, astronomers, authors, and historians) explain what climate change looks like, how humans have already and are continuing to contribute to it, how and why it has become politicized, and what needs to happen moving forward for real progress to be made. David Wallace-Wells, journalist and New America Foundation National Fellow, says that the main goal of climate action is not to win over the skeptical minority, but to "make those people who are concerned but still fundamentally complacent about the issue to be really engaged in a way that they prioritize climate change in their politics and their voting and make sure that our leaders think of climate change as a first-order political priority." Read David Wallace-Wells' latest book The Uninhabitable Earth: Life After Warming at https://amzn.to/2CMDSGI ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TRANSCRIPT: GINA MCCARTHY: Climate is always portrayed on newscasts as being some kind of big debate. You know, the big debate among the scientists is that 97 percent of them know it's happening and are really worried about it. Three percent are skeptical. That's not a balance. That's an overwhelming majority and that needs to drive the decision, especially in a democracy. BILL NYE: The more you think about it everybody, 97 percent of the world's scientists – not 97 percent of some institute that somebody started in a remote part of the world and is releasing press releases. Ninety-seven percent of the scientists in the world are very concerned about climate change. PHILIP KITCHER: Climate science is built on views about the atmosphere that have been developed very successfully and in a very rigorous way from the nineteenth century to the present. There isn't any doubt about the mechanisms of the greenhouse effect. There isn't really any doubt about the evidence behind the consensus that says we have contributed enormously to the warming effects that are now becoming apparent not only in the present but also from the record of the earth's average temperature. NYE: You can look at the graphs. You can study the stuff for yourself. If nothing else do this. Wherever you live, get access to the coldest temperature of each year for the last century. And unless you live in just very few places you will see the coldest temperature where you live has steadily increased. They'll be some dips. There'll be some ups, but overall you'll find it – and that's just one that almost everybody who has internet access can get those data, they're available. And just look at that one thing and you'll see the world's getting warmer everybody. MICHELLE THALLER: Now the reason our atmosphere is getting warmer and warmer and warmer is because we humans are putting lots of carbon dioxide up into the atmosphere. And this acts as what we call a greenhouse gas. Sunlight can get through the atmosphere, but the carbon dioxide traps it and it can't release itself back into space so it gets warmer and warmer over time. Carbon dioxide doesn't just warm the atmosphere. It also affects our oceans. When ocean water combines with carbon dioxide to create something called carbonic acid and it makes the oceans more and more acidic over time. And this is a really big problem for marine life. There are things like algae. The algae in the oceans are responsible for most of the oxygen that we breathe. And the algae are having trouble forming because of the higher acid levels in the ocean. So even if the one thing you solved was cooling the earth down, if we continue to put more and more carbon dioxide into our atmosphere there will be other serious repercussions. We could end up killing the ocean life system, for example. NYE: The earth is getting warmer faster than it has ever gotten before and that's the problem. It's not that the world hasn't had more carbon dioxide. It's not that the world hasn't been warmer. The problem is the speed at which things are changing. We are inducing a sixth mass extinction event kind of by accident and we don't want to be the extinctee if I may coin...

Will water become the habitat of the future? Visionary projects for a life with the tides are forging ahead worldwide. Experts forecast that by 2100, sea levels will be two meters higher than they are today. This could force 40 percent of the world’s population out of their homes, for example, in Mumbai, Tokyo, Guangzhou or Bangladesh. The US won’t be spared either. Miami, New Orleans and New York would also have to be evacuated. Entire city districts would be under water. Climate change would drastically alter our metropolitan areas. That's why ideas that originated in science fiction have now becoming reality. Floating and underwater buildings could become places of refuge. What sounds like a utopia is soon to become reality. The first pioneers are already living in floating neighborhoods. Could the South Pacific paradise of Tahiti also be saved in this way? This is still all tantalizing luxury. Visionary hotel operators offer rooms with an underwater view. Or dinner during which fish and marine life are a feature in floating restaurants. Many of these futuristic plans involve water. Will we be farming on the sea? Will the "SeaOrbiter” floating research station designed by Parisian architect Jacques Rougerie get underway soon? Or will we walk through seaports on floating boulevards? ------------------------------------------------------------------ DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

I talk about the game's mechanics, the frequency of extreme weather events, and the knock-on effects on human behaviour in the game. In short, the game does a very good job, way beyond a crude depiction of global warming. Thanks to 2K and Firaxis for providing early access to the game! (1) See http://www.trillionthtonne.org/questions.html (2) As ever, SkepticalScience has your back: https://www.skepticalscience.com/Climate-Change-The-40-Year-Delay-Between-Cause-and-Effect.html (3) For a cool interactive report about how hurricanes have changed with anthropogenic climate change, see https://nca2014.globalchange.gov/report/our-changing-climate/changes-hurricanes (4) Note here that I'm talking about the mean 'waviness' of the jet stream, leading to more frequent and more intense outbreaks of Arctic air. The recent cold outbreak over North America was likely exacerbated by this effect, but not caused by it - the root cause was a SSW, which current science indicates was not made more likely due to climate change. (5) See e.g. http://oxfordre.com/climatescience/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228620.001.0001/acrefore-9780190228620-e-344 (6) Natural variability in the atmosphere is something of a politicized and so thorny topic. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hockey_Stick_and_the_Climate_Wars for an idea of why I didn't want to delve into this in detail. There are a few things which I didn't mention in the video because I recorded it in a great hurry. Here are three of them. Firstly the game only specifically addresses CO2 emissions rather than a multitude of gases such as methane - this is technically inaccurate but I can understand why they simplified it. Secondly I didn't talk about any quantitative aspects of X emissions equating to Y warming or Z sea ice loss as that would require a standardised unit of emissions in the game, which it doesn't provide! Besides, there's no reason to believe that all other geophysical parameters would be the same as our Earth, making any kind of quantitative analysis difficult at best (and, to be honest, not that interesting!). Lastly, arguably the most unrealistic part of the game is that all world leaders in it believe that climate change is a significant issue!

To tackle climate change, a global perspective is needed and this can be provided by satellites. Their data is key if we want to prepare ourselves for the consequences of climate change. While our Earth Explorers gather data to understand how our planet works and understand the impact that climate change and human activity are having on the planet, the European Union’s Copernicus Sentinels provide systematic data for environmental services that help adapt to and mitigate change. The video offers an overview of how European satellites keep watch over our world.

In this thorough talk, Dr. Martin examines the intersections of climate change and racism, from who's at the table during policymaking, to which communities are effected by natural disasters, and which receive resources first. Incorporating multidisciplinary data and research, Dr. Martin proposes ways for us to scrutinize bias in ourselves, our workplaces, and our social groups. Dr. Atyia Martin is a Certified Emergency Manager with a diverse set of experiences in public health, emergency management, intelligence, and homeland security. Mayor Martin Walsh appointed her as the Chief Resilience Officer for the City of Boston as part of the 100 Resilient Cities initiative pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation. In this role, she is responsible for leading the development and implementation of Boston’s Resilience Strategy. Boston will focus on advancing racial equity as the foundation of the Resilience Strategy process. Dr. Martin has served as adjunct faculty in the Master of Homeland Security at Northeastern University. She was previously the Director of the Office of Public Health Preparedness at the Boston Public Health Commission. Her previous professional experience includes the Boston Police Department’s Boston Regional Intelligence Center; City of Boston’s Mayor’s Office of Emergency Management; the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI); and active duty Air Force assigned to the National Security Agency. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Biden and other administration officials have emphasized that the White House is taking a "whole of government" approach to climate change. They've also underscored that they believe the President's actions will help spur job growth, and categorized people working in industries vulnerable to job loss, such as coal miners, under their umbrella of environmental justice. "Today is climate day at the White House and, which means that today is jobs day at the White House. We're talking about American innovation, American products, American labor," Biden said at the outset of his remarks at a signing ceremony. "We're talking about the health of our families and cleaner water cleaner air and cleaner communities. We're talking about national security." He continued: "It's a future of enormous hope and opportunity. It's about coming to the moment to deal with this maximum threat that we exist with as now facing us, climate change, with a greater sense of urgency. In my view, we've already waited too long to deal with this climate crisis. We can't wait any longer." The executive order on oil and natural gas leases directs the interior secretary to launch a "rigorous review" of the existing leasing and permitting programs related to fossil fuel development, and to identify steps to double renewable energy production from offshore wind by 2030, according to a fact sheet provided by the White House. The halting of new leases fulfills a campaign promise by Biden and will expand an existing 60-day moratorium issued by the President on his first day in office. Biden's climate actions mark a sharp departure from the Trump administration's efforts to maximize fossil fuel production and expand oil and gas drilling on federal lands but climate emissaries for the administration emphasized they hope to build new job opportunities out of the changes.

All inspired by a one year old protest by climate activist Greta Thunberg, who skipped her school to protest in front of the swedish parliament in august 2018. In this video, I explain her journey and the urgency for climate change.

It's grown by nearly 125 million farmers, from Latin America to Africa to Asia. But as man-made climate change warms the atmosphere, the notoriously particular coffee plant is struggling. Places like Colombia, which once had the perfect climate to grow Arabica coffee, are changing. Now, experts estimate the amount of land that can sustain coffee will fall 50 percent by 2050. It's not just a crisis for consumers but for the millions who have made a livelihood out of growing coffee.

As the economic costs of disasters rise, can the insurance industry cope with the losses? Read more https://econ.st/2ndFMZ3 Click here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: https://econ.st/2xvTKdy Extreme weather events like these are becoming more frequent. It’s not just causing untold human suffering but also ever-growing economic costs. As the losses pile up, will insurers be able to cope with the damage? In 2017 Hurricane Harvey, mudslides in Sierra Leone, and monsoon floods in South Asia all contributed to the largest year on record for insurance losses - with payouts totalling $144bn. In America for example between 1980 and 2015 you had about five events a year that each cost more than $1bn in damage. Since 2016 it’s been an average of 15 events like this a year. This leaves the insurance industry uniquely exposed and having to pay out a lot of money all at once. Insurers aren’t helped by the obsolete information they rely on either. They find it hard to predict when this happens because their models are not really taking into account climate change. They look at maybe 30, 40 years of data and they assume that the environment within these data, this period, is pretty stable. So these models look at a world that doesn’t really exist anymore. And it’s no surprise what’s now happening to the price of insurance. If you look at the last quarter premiums on property insurance in America rose by 10%. In Australia and New Zealand they rose by about 18%. And at some point premiums may simply become unaffordable especially so as disasters regularly happen in places where people can least afford to pay high premiums. Half of last year’s losses from natural disasters were uninsured. And in America 85% of homeowners have no flood insurance even though half of the population lives near water. Increasing premiums might just lead to even more people being left out in the cold. But there are some more novel solutions. So, for example, Lloyd’s of London has a policy that sends €1,000 per hectare to Spanish olive farmers as soon as the temperatures reach 36 degrees. So these are very simple solutions to put in place, very easy to implement and also quite cheap in fact, which is the main advantage. Rather than compensate the farmers after their losses are reported insurance companies monitor a specific parameter such as rainfall or temperature. When this passes an agreed threshold they pay out a lump sum. Known as parametric insurance, this approach can help the insurance companies cut costs and in turn bring down premiums for the consumer. But as the climate crisis worsens the same challenges are likely to re-emerge. We cannot expect insurers to save us from climate change because the world fundamentally cannot be insured against climate change. However many companies already offer discounts to homeowners who for example install metallic shutters on the windows or flood-proof doors. But they could make a more drastic step. So a city on the coast wants to build flood defences. This will require a lot of money but perhaps insurers maybe in cooperation with banks could offer some financing for them to do that. They can help us design solutions or take measures that will limit losses. And this is really the crucial role they can play.

But the climate of this unique and remote region can be both an early indicator of the climate of the rest of the Earth and a driver for weather patterns across the globe. William Chapman explains why scientists often describe the Arctic as the “canary in the coal mine” when it comes to climate change. Lesson by William Chapman, animation by Sandro Katamashvili.

Her score lets us hear decades of Arctic sea ice loss in just minutes. In the beautiful and sometimes discordant piano piece, played by Kristina Lee, numerical scientific data becomes an emotional experience intended to reconnect us to the rhythm of the planet. Judy Twedt is a fifth-generation Washingtonian who pursued a PhD in atmospheric sciences at the UW to better understand the physics of global climate change. Three years into her research after the reversal of US participation in the Paris Climate Accord, she designed a new PhD program to develop novel ways to increase comprehension of our changing climate — by listening to the vital signs of the planet. She uses climate data to create climate soundtracks with three-dimensional, spatialized sound fields. These soundtracks explore tensions between the time-scales of human experience and that of climate change. She mixes art and science to promote public reckoning with our changing climate and its associated risks. She has received an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship; the University of Washington's Husky 100 and Husky Green Awards for her work in sustainability and science communication. She enjoys swimming in the Puget Sound, making pies and addressing big multi-disciplinary problems. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

In fact, 97 percent of published reports agree that climate change is fuelled by manmade greenhouse gases. But while there is overwhelming consensus within the scientific community, climate change remains a contentious topic in politics in the United States. In this episode, TechKnow examines the debate over climate change. Lindsay Moran travels to Washington, DC to look at what is at stake in the debate. Politicians fall into two camps: those who believe in human-induced climate change and those who don't. When asked why climate change is so politically charged, John Holden, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology, tells us: "I think the most fundamental reason is this misperception that being in favour of addressing the climate change challenge is to be against jobs and the economy." Shini Somara heads to Miami, Florida, where there simply isn't time for a debate over whether climate change is a legitimate threat. The state is already facing the immediate effects of rising sea levels. According to climate scientist Ben Kirtman, Florida is the epicentre for climate change impacts. Rising sea levels are already affecting the lives of Miami coastline residents. Some have faced property damage from rising water, while others reflect on the reality of relocation. "I've been here for my entire lifetime," says Dan Kipnis, a Miami resident and environmental activist. "I know for a fact I'm going to have to leave." Miami Beach mayor Philip Levine says he cannot afford to be concerned with the politics of climate change. "As mayor I don't have the liberty or time to debate why climate change is happening. All I have is the opportunity to fix it," he says. "That bay is not Republican, it's not Democrat, it knows no limits." City officials are moving quickly to keep the city dry by installing pumps and raising buildings and streets. The infrastructure is expensive, and applying for funding from the state or federal level again highlights the political divides surrounding climate change. "When they are trying to get resources from the state of Florida," says climate scientist Ben Kirtman, "they can't really talk about the climate change part of it." - Subscribe to our channel: http://aje.io/AJSubscribe - Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish - Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera - Check our website: http://www.aljazeera.com/	Al Jazeera English,News,climate change,al Jazeera,politics,environment,jazeera,TechKnow,US Politics,youtube,climate change politics,climate,change,politics of climate change,climate change usa,usa climate change,climate change 2016,us climate change,global warming,climate change and politics	25	News & Politics	PT24M8S	1448	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5wYJ9ChqFZs/maxresdefault.jpg	1	11611	131	8	0	47

"Well, I don't think science knows actually," Trump added. For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://cnb.cx/2NGeIvi A California environmental official challenged President Donald Trump to believe and follow the science on climate change after Trump suggested that record-breaking temperatures in the state would cool down on their own. “It’ll start getting cooler. You just watch,” Trump said after Wade Crowfoot, California’s secretary for natural resources, urged him and others not to “put our head in the sand” and simply ignore the warming climate. Trump’s remark during a roundtable in McLellan Park, California, on the wildfires that have engulfed huge swaths of the state, generated laughs from some of the participants. But Crowfoot responded: “I wish science agreed with you.” Trump, with a smirk, shot back: “OK, well, I don’t think science knows, actually.” The White House declined CNBC’s request for further comment on the president’s remarks. Crowfoot tweeted later Monday: “It actually won’t get cooler Mr. President. #ClimateChangeIsReal.” Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, speaking in Wilmington, Delaware, on Monday, struck a very different tone on the issue. “With every bout with nature’s fury, caused by our own inaction on climate change, more Americans see and feel the devastation in big cities, small towns, on coastlines and farmlands,” Biden said, according to his prepared remarks. “It is happening everywhere. It is happening now. It affects us all,” Biden said. The president has largely blamed the wildfires, which continue to blaze in parts of California, on poor forest management practices. He said at the roundtable, which also included Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom, that he had been told by the leader of a “major country” in Europe, ”‘We have trees that are far more explosive’ – explosive in terms of fire – ‘... than they have in California, and we don’t have any problem.’” Trump in the past has repeatedly called climate change a “hoax.” But Crowfoot stressed in his remarks Monday that boiling temperatures in parts of California are part of a larger trend. “We’ve had temperatures explode this summer. You may have learned that we broke a world record in the Death Valley – 130 degrees [Fahrenheit]. But even in greater L.A., 120-plus degrees. And we’re seeing this warming trend make our summers warmer, but also our winters warmer, as well,” Crowfoot said. “I think one area of mutual agreement and priority is vegetation management, but I think we want to work with you to really recognize the changing climate and what it means to our forest, and actually work together with that science, that science is going to be key.” “If we ignore that science and sort of put our head in the sand and think it’s all about vegetation management, we’re not going to succeed together protecting Californians,” Crowfoot said. » Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision » Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC » Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic Turn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.

SUBSCRIBE so you don’t miss a video! ►► http://bit.ly/iotbs_sub We’re on PATREON now! Join the community ►► https://www.patreon.com/itsokaytobesmart ↓↓↓ More info and sources below ↓↓↓ Can trees really save us from climate change? For eons, nature has relied on photosynthesis as a big way to keep carbon dioxide levels from getting out of control. But as we have put more carbon into the air, we’ve also cut down many of the forests we need to suck that carbon up. So big tree-planting initiatives like #TeamTrees to the rescue, right? Actually, we need to think bigger. Here’s three ways trees really can help us solve climate change, from a guy who wants to plant a TRILLION trees, to how we might save the forests we’ve got, to scientists hacking biology to make trees even better.

First, create green jobs. Investing in renewable energy could create millions of family sustaining, union jobs and build the infrastructure we need for marginalized communities to access clean water and air. Second, stop dirty energy. A massive investment in renewable energy jobs isn’t enough to combat the climate crisis. If we are going to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, we must tackle the problem at its source: Stop digging up and burning more oil, gas, and coal. Third, kick fossil fuel companies out of our politics. For decades, companies like Exxon, Chevron, Shell, and BP have been polluting our democracy by pouring billions of dollars into our politics and bankrolling elected officials to enact policies that protect their profits. The oil and gas industry spent over $103 million on the 2016 federal elections alone. Fourth, require the fossil fuel companies that have profited from environmental injustice to compensate the communities they've harmed. As if buying off our democracy wasn’t enough, these corporations have also deliberately misled the public for years on the amount of damage their products have been causing. If these solutions sound drastic to you, it’s because they are. They have to be if we have any hope of keeping our planet habitable. The climate crisis is not a far-off apocalyptic nightmare — it is our present day.

For humans, this can mean using technology to find solutions. But for some plants and animals, adapting to these changes involves the most ancient solution of all: evolution.

Climate Change is the bad news story that isn’t going away From heatwaves to hurricanes, from droughts to floods Extreme weather events are becoming more frequent, putting lives at risk Human activity is causing our climate to change The CO2 emissions from our cars, our industries and our power plants are heating up the planet To prevent further dangerous levels of climate change Countries around the world signed up to the Paris Agreement The Paris Agreement aims to keep global warming below 2 degrees To stop the planet getting warmer, we need to reduce the use of fossil fuels And increase the share of renewable energy, like from wind, solar and low carbon sources Climate action is everyone‘s responsibility: governments, businesses, communities, individuals The actions we can take to reduce our carbon footprint, like investing in green technologies can also reduce costs and create jobs The risks and costs of inaction are too high to ignore. So what are we waiting for? The time to act is now.

The word ‘retirement’ usually implies sitting back, relaxing and winding down - but Fi's TEDx talk challenges this assumption, exploring instead the wisdom, experience and free time that older generations in particular, can bring to critical problems. Fi says, "We, the Elders, have a key role to play. Do all that you can in the active years you have left. We owe it to the children to leave them the best legacy we can – a sustaining, diverse and inhabitable planet". One of the earliest members of campaign group Grandparents for a Safe Earth, Fi has spent the last decade committed to environmental activism. Last year, aged 70, Fi joined Extinction Rebellion on the streets of London. Previously a very law-abiding citizen, she was arrested in Oxford Circus, and continues to lead young and old in environmental actions across the country. In her earlier years Fi studied Modern Languages at Oxford University, worked as a librarian and raised two sons. She has been happily married to her husband Andrew for 50 years. #ExtinctionRebellion Credits: Our talks and films are produced, filmed and edited by a brilliant team of talented volunteers and pro-bono partners: Directed and Produced by Mel Rodrigues, Creative Director TEDxBristol Production Manager: Clare Crossley Filmed and edited by Floating Harbour: Richard da Costa Reuben Gaines Chessie Sharman Raph Watson Tom Young Ben Scrase Dan O'Connell Born in 1948, the eldest of four children, Fi went to St Hilda’s College, Oxford on a full grant to study Modern Languages. Shortly afterwards she married Andrew, the young man she met at a speaking compettiton, that she won. Nearly 50 years later they are still together and during that time Fi has worked as a librarian, raised two sons and given her time to a wide variety of voluntary work, including running a Christian retreat house. Fi’s environmental ‘lightbulb moment’ came while living in France in the early 2000s. It was during this time, when she was engaged in a period of deep spiritual reflection, walking the hills and studying the writing of Marion Woodman and Joanna Macy, that she heard the trees screaming during the heatwave of 2003. Her mounting fear for the natural world and desire to speak out brought her back to Bristol, where she immediately threw herself into environmental activism. A dedicated member of ‘Grandparents for a Safe Earth’, over the last decade she has dressed up as a polar bear, a spider monkey and an orangutan, signed hundreds of petitions, lobbied her MP and occupied the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy for six hours in June 2018. Since its launch in October 2018, Fi has been an active member of Extinction Rebellion. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

More than a thousand people have lost their lives so far and tens of thousands have been rendered homeless due to continuous heavy rainfalls and rising flood levels. Floods have affected 11 states in India, including in areas which have never experienced it before. What really are the causes for the increased incidents of flooding in India? Are these seasonal phenomena becoming worse as the years go by? Can India mitigate the adverse impact of climate change and flooding without jeopardising its economic growth objectives and pull millions out of poverty? And how long can the poor bear the brunt of the devastation caused by the extreme weather events?

During the last 200 years, human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels have increased concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere by 40%. If unchecked, continuing emissions will warm up the planet by 2.6°C to 4.8°C by the end of this century. This would have serious implications for human societies and the natural world. This 60-second animation from the world's two leading science academies brings you the science behind climate change.

Global emissions are reaching record levels and show no sign of peaking. The last four years were the four hottest on record, and winter temperatures in the Arctic have risen by 3°C since 1990. Sea levels are rising, coral reefs are dying, and we are starting to see the life-threatening impact of climate change on health, through air pollution, heatwaves and risks to food security. The impacts of climate change are being felt everywhere and are having very real consequences on people’s lives. Climate change is disrupting national economies, costing us dearly today and even more tomorrow. But there is a growing recognition that affordable, scalable solutions are available now that will enable us all to leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies. The latest analysis shows that if we act now, we can reduce carbon emissions within 12 years and hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C and even, as asked by the latest science, to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. Thankfully, we have the Paris Agreement – a visionary, viable, forward-looking policy framework that sets out exactly what needs to be done to stop climate disruption and reverse its impact. But the agreement itself is meaningless without ambitious action. UN Secretary-General António Guterres is calling on all leaders to come to New York on 23 September with concrete, realistic plans to enhance their nationally determined contributions by 2020, in line with reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 45 per cent over the next decade, and to net zero emissions by 2050.	dpiavl,english,global issues,topics/issues,cas,cas2019,climate change,6088742229001	25	News & Politics	PT4M8S	248	2d	sd	false			1216572	11016	11876	0	4322

Hal Harvey, an energy and climate expert, explains how net-zero buildings and improved building codes are key to lowering emissions. Buildings consume about 40 percent of all energy, and too much of that energy is wasted. Architects and builders can lower energy needs with better insulation, better windows, more thermal mass and overhangs.

On a simple level, music festivals have significant carbon footprints, and efforts to mitigate them are necessary. More intriguingly, though, festivals are an apt testing ground for new ideas in sustainability. Whether it's Houghton's reusable cup scheme, the "circular waste economies" at We Love Green and DGTL, or the many other initiatives at events like Gottwood, Terraforma and Meadows In The Mountains, more and more festivals are trialling bold new methods of sustainability, in some cases winning awards for them. It's an encouraging sign of how dance music can play a positive role in the world's response to the climate crisis. In this 10 minute film, we look at a small selection of electronic music festivals rising to this challenge, and examine the ways they're pushing sustainability practices forward. This feature is the start of an ongoing series dedicated to electronic music and the climate crisis. You can also read our feature about what can dance music do about the climate crisis (https://www.residentadvisor.net/features/3476) and listen to an audio feature on the sustainability of vinyl (https://www.residentadvisor.net/podcast-episode.aspx?exchange=465). Our goal is is to inspire discussion and debate about how our community can best contribute to the broader climate movement. RA is working on internal climate-related company goals, which we will share in the coming months.

Prof Richard Betts from the Met Office Hadley Centre said we are "seeing a sign of what would be normal conditions under a future warming world of 3C". While natural weather patterns have driven recent fires, researchers said it's "common sense" that human-induced heating is playing a role. Last year was Australia's warmest and driest year on record. Please subscribe HERE http://bit.ly/1rbfUog UK researchers have carried out a rapid analysis of the impact of climate change on the risk of wildfires happening all over the world. Their study looked at 57 research papers published since the last major review of climate science came out in 2013.	bbc,bbc news,news	25	News & Politics	PT10M18S	618	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J__4V0ujlaU/maxresdefault.jpg	1	362477	2621	399	0	1712

As families flee water scarcity, crop failure and rising sea levels, the refugee crisis is bound to wreak havoc on the international system with tremendous economic and political consequences. Russia, however, is likely to be insulated from the most disastrous effects. In fact, the Russians actually stand to benefit from climate change in numerous ways, and policymakers in Moscow believe this is their license to global resurgence.

Not by rehashing the same data and facts we've been discussing for years, says climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe. In this inspiring, pragmatic talk, Hayhoe shows how the key to having a real discussion is to connect over shared values like family, community and religion -- and to prompt people to realize that they already care about a changing climate. "We can't give in to despair," she says. "We have to go out and look for the hope we need to inspire us to act -- and that hope begins with a conversation, today."

In a trio of directives, Mr. Biden directed the Interior secretary to freeze new oil and gas leases on public lands and offshore waters "wherever possible," and review existing leasing and permitting practices related to fossil fuel development on federal lands and water. The president's executive order sets a goal of conserving at least 30% of land and water by 2030, and begins the process for the U.S. to develop an emission reduction target and a climate finance plan. Earlier Wednesday, special presidential envoy for climate John Kerry and national climate adviser Gina McCarthy joined White House press secretary Jen Psaki at her daily briefing to discuss the administration’s climate actions. #JoeBiden #JenPsaki #ClimateChange CBSN is CBS News’ 24/7 digital streaming news service featuring live, anchored coverage available for free across all platforms.

I’ve been on the look-out for the best arguments why CO2 is NOT causing climate change. Here’s the best one I’ve found to date along with some counter-arguments and evidence. It looks at whether CO2 is saturated in the atmosphere and more CO2 will now make minimal additional impact on warming. We get into the science at a molecular level on this one!

With the climate crisis gaining recognition around the world and climate strikes in full swing with hundreds of thousands of people taking to the streets in a plea for action against climate change, I figured it would be good to look at what might be the best solution to climate change: trees. Trees capture and store carbon, reducing the amount of CO2 in the air. Recently a study looked at the amount of trees we could plant on Earth, which lead to a lot of people thinking we could solve the climate change issue by planting a trillion trees. But this isn't exactly true. Find out why in my latest video!

Help NCSE build their climate change in scripted media database: https://ncse.ngo/understanding-climate-change-scripted-media-project In this Our Changing Climate climate change video essay, we look at how and why TV comedies get climate change so wrong. We look at the last 30 years of television comedies that address climate change from The Simpsons to South Park to The Good Place to Modern Family to It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia in order to understand why TV comedies get climate change so wrong. TV comedies use a number of character archetypes that turn environmentalists into obnoxious pariahs, directly deny the existence of climate change in the case of South Park, or build jokes and comedic elements on how hopeless climate action can be. TV comedies ultimately have undermined needed progress on climate change and climate action by approaching the issue of climate change in an unproductive way. To conclude we offer a number of avenues through which TV comedies like The Simpsons, The Politician, and The Good Place might be able to actually spur climate action through jokes and comedy.

Hello, do you know who I am? I am the Earth, yes this very planet and I would like to talk to you about a couple of things which worry me and should upset you, too. If you were to join me in an elevator, do you know what I would tell you? That I am hot, very very hot. This is because of Climate Change, which is something that human beings have a big responsibility for. Every time you turn on the light, the computer, the microwave o even shower, you are consuming energy. This energy is produced, largely, by burning gases, coal, or petroleum, which are known as fossil fuels. When burning them you are sending off tons and tons and tons of gases into my atmosphere. These gases remain in the atmosphere forming a type of roof which withholds heat. This is called the “greenhouse effect” because a Greenhouses is where one can cultivate plants, and the roof does not allow heat to escape, and I am getting hotter and hotter. ¿Do you want to know how you can help me change this situation?

But an issue that may have received less attention is just how long this process lasts. Even if humans stopped emitting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere tomorrow, the expansion effect would continue in the oceans for centuries more, making it effectively irreversible in our lifetimes.” How Eating Seaweed Can Help Cows to Belch Less Methane https://e360.yale.edu/features/how-eating-seaweed-can-help-cows-to-belch-less-methane “Emissions from the world’s nearly 1.5 billion cattle are a major source of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. Now, researchers in California and elsewhere are experimenting with seaweed as a dietary additive for cows that can dramatically cut their methane production.” Sign Up For The Seeker Newsletter Here - http://bit.ly/1UO1PxI ____________________ Seeker inspires us to see the world through the lens of science and evokes a sense of curiosity, optimism and adventure.

Over the coming century, it is expected to affect agriculture, energy, health, infrastructure, natural resources, national security and water availability. This assessment, which represents the most up to date and comprehensive overview of climate change impacts on the U.S., provides critical input to planning and policy at the state and national level to reduce the human influence on climate and adapt to future change. Katharine Hayhoe, Ph.D., is director of the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech, part of the South-Central Climate Science Center. Her research focuses on developing and applying high-resolution climate projections to evaluate the future impacts of climate change on human society and the natural environment. Hayhoe has published more than 70 peer-reviewed publications and served as lead author on key reports for the U.S. Global Change Research Program and the National Academy of Sciences. Hayhoe is currently serving as lead author for the 2014 Third U.S. National Climate Assessment. Hayhoe earned a bachelor’s of science in physics and astronomy from the University of Toronto and an M.S. and Ph.D. in atmospheric science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Some scientists believe genetically modified trees could be a possible fix. Some say altering a tree’s DNA would allow the tree to grow twice as fast, absorb twice as much carbon in half the time, and sequester even more carbon from the atmosphere to slow down the climate crisis.

Regenerative organic farming emphasizes the importance of soil health and includes practices like cover cropping, crop rotation, holistic animal grazing, and the use of compost. Proponents suggest it could increase biodiversity, make farms more resilient to floods, produce healthier food, and improve farm animal welfare. 'Healthy soil equals healthy food equals healthy people,' says Jeff Moyer, the CEO of the Rodale Institute, which has studied regenerative and organic farming methods for 70 years.

Marches and protests are being held in more than 3,400 towns and cities across 130 countries. Hundreds of thousands of people marched all over Australia! The crowds in Sydney of school students were joined by adults who also left work for the day, people in Cairns took the opportunity to talk about saving the reef and there was a big turnout in Canberra. --- GRETA THUNBERG HISTORY Now with all these protests and marches happening around the world. You might be wondering how it started. Well it's all inspired by a teenager from Sweden. Greta Thunberg is a 16 year old from Sweden and she is the person behind this global movement. It started in August last year. She believed that her government wasn't doing enough to fight climate change. So she decided to send a message. She decided every Friday she would sit outside the Swedish parliament until Sweden is in line with the Paris Agreement. After 3 days she had 35 other strikers with her and after 3 weeks she had 10,000. Greta's actions attracted heaps of attention and pretty soon millions of kids all over the world had joined in too. Greta's become an international icon. She's travelled the world talking to world leaders. Of course that's not an easy thing to achieve. Climate change is a global problem and a lot of countries can't agree on the best way to tackle it. The Aussie government says it does have a plan. Greta says the best thing people can do is start small because everyone has the power to make a difference. -- SCHOOL SAVING FINCHES Some kids in Townsville are on a mission to save the Black-Throated Finche. Experts reckon they're extinct in New South Wales and only around a thousand are left in Queensland. But the students at Belgian Gardens have managed to breed 120 over the past six years! -- VR CORAL REEF A team of international scientists created a virtual reality reef to provide a snapshot of what the world's coral reefs look like and how they're changing. -- GRETA THUNBERG CROP ART What better way to draw attention to the issue of climate change Than to create a giant portrait of Greta Thunberg. An Italian land-artist created a 27 thousand square metre picture of her by ploughing through a field in Verona, Italy. Hopefully Greta approves of the effort! __ For the past 50 years, Behind the News has been helping to break down current issues and events for young people all around the world.

Billed the “affair of the century”, the legal case was brought by four NGOs who accused the French state of not living up to its own commitments - including a multi-year plan to cut carbon emissions - or to the 2015 Paris Climate accord. This was the first time a French court has ruled that the state can be held responsible for its climate commitments ramping up pressure on other countries to act on global warming as well. The court ordered the state to pay each of the four organizations a symbolic amount of one euro in compensation. #France #Climate #Court 📣 Arirang News(Facebook) : https://www.facebook.com/arirangtvnews 📣 Arirang News(Twitter) : https://twitter.com/arirangtvnews 📣 News Center(YouTube) : https://www.youtube.com/c/NEWSCENTER_ARIRANGTV 2021-02-04, 07:00 (KST)	arirang,korean,South Korea,Arirang News,news,Seoul,arirang tv,아리랑tv,아리랑뉴스,뉴스,북한,north korea,대한민국,미국,U.S.,policy,politics,정치,정책,경제,economy,스포츠,날씨,weather,이슈,월드,world,global,issue,sports,프랑스,법원,정부,기후,변화,환경,책임,배상,글로벌,court,France,climate,change,government,guilty,environment,carbon,emission,compensation	25	News & Politics	PT37S	37	2d	hd	false	https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r9j9jw8N2Jw/maxresdefault.jpg	1	153	9	1	0	3

We never played it live before, as it is a challenging one to play, and place in a set list. It’s emotionally heavy, and would almost “hurt” the rest of the songs in a way. We just really wanted to do this on camera for our fans. Global warming is a reality and a relevant topic, we feel it’s good to be reminded of one of the most important challenges of our time: How to grow as a species without being a parasite to our planet, the only home we have. “We will see our children growing” is a mantra for future generations, and in a figurative way we hope the children in all of us will grow, evolve, and take action for a more compassionate and meaningful world.

And now, the dangers caused by tons of melting ice are rising sharply. Every year, climate change is destroying two of the currently 70 square kilometers of glaciers left in the Alps. The permafrost in the Alps is thawing, and transforming what used to be sturdy slopes into loose screes. In addition, climate change is leading to significantly more extreme weather conditions every year, while heavy rainfall causes serious erosion. The result: avalanches and landslides like those in Bondo, Switzerland, or Valsertal in Austria. In Switzerland, residential areas are shrinking as people are forced to leave their homes forever. The disappearance of glaciers as water reservoirs is already posing a major problem. Farmers in Engadine, who have been using meltwater for irrigation for centuries, are already facing water shortages. Last summer, they had to rely on helicopters to transport water to their herds in the Grison Alps. Above all, alpine villages depend on winter tourism to survive. Yet experts are forecasting that by mid-century, there will only be enough natural snow left to ski above 2,000 meters, which will spell out the end for about 70 percent of the ski resorts in the Eastern Alps. But instead of developing alternatives, lots of money is still being invested in ski tourism. Snow cannon are used to defy climate change, and artificial snow systems are under construction at ever higher altitudes. As usual, it’s the environment that is set to lose as the unique alpine landscape is further destroyed by soil compaction and erosion. Some municipalities are now working on new models of alpine tourism for the future. As global temperatures continue to rise, the cooler mountain regions will become increasingly attractive for tourists, especially in the summer. -------------------------------------------------------------------- DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Watch more 2020 election explainers at http://vox.com/ElectionVideos All of recorded human history has happened during a period in which the average global temperature didn’t change by more than 1 degree Celsius. But the burning of fossil fuels has triggered a temperature rise projected to exceed 3 degrees by the end of the century. It will be catastrophic. But it can be avoided if we massively scale back the burning of fossil fuels. The US isn’t the biggest emitter of carbon dioxide in the world, but it's emitted more carbon dioxide in total than any other country. So the US has an important role to play in global decarbonization; the world basically can’t get there without the US’s full participation. But the current US president doesn’t have any plans to do that. His Democratic challenger in the 2020 election, Joe Biden, does. Biden’s plan is ambitious: Its goal is to completely transition the US to clean energy by 2050. But his plan doesn’t get into the details of exactly how that will happen. For that, we talked to physicist and engineer Saul Griffith, who took us through his incredibly detailed road map for how the US could actually walk away from fossil fuels in the next 30 years. This was the first in our series of 2020 election explainers, all based on viewer suggestions.

The thicker layer of greenhouse gases traps more heat. This result in an increase in average temperature of the earth and the earth becomes hotter and hotter. This is called global warming. If we do not take steps to reduce global warming, it will lead to loss of human lives, plants and animals. Steps to reduce global warming: Plant more trees. Reduce, reuse and recycle. Use less hot water. Turn off electronic devices when not in use. Spread awareness. Come on everybody, let us reduce global warming.

Read more here: https://blog.ted.com/allan-savorys-how-to-fight-desertification-and-reverse-climate-change-criticisms-updates/ "Desertification is a fancy word for land that is turning to desert," begins Allan Savory in this quietly powerful talk. And terrifyingly, it's happening to about two-thirds of the world's grasslands, accelerating climate change and causing traditional grazing societies to descend into social chaos. Savory has devoted his life to stopping it. He now believes -- and his work so far shows -- that a surprising factor can protect grasslands and even reclaim degraded land that was once desert.

After apologising for being on holiday in Hawaii while large areas of New South Wales burned, he was due to visit the fire service's HQ on Sunday. As the blazes spread across almost 100,000 acres, Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack admitted there "absolutely" needed to be more action on climate change.

Extinction is now happening up to 100 times faster than the natural evolutionary rate, but the issue is about more than the loss of individual species. Everything in the natural world is connected in networks that support the whole of life on earth, including us, and we are losing many of the benefits that nature provides to us. The loss of insects is threatening the pollination of crops, while the loss of biodiversity in the soil also threatens plants growth. Plants underpin many of the things that we need, and yet one in four is now threatened with extinction. Last year, a UN report identified the key drivers of biodiversity loss, including overfishing, climate change and pollution. But the single biggest driver of biodiversity loss is the destruction of natural habitats. Seventy-five per cent of Earth's land surface (where not covered by ice) has been changed by humans, much of it for agriculture, and as consumers we may unwittingly be contributing towards the loss of species through what we buy in the supermarket. Our destructive relationship with the natural world isn’t just putting the ecosystems that we rely on at risk. Human activities like the trade in animals and the destruction of habitats drive the emergence of diseases. Disease ecologists believe that if we continue on this pathway, this year’s pandemic will not be a one-off event.

Sources & further reading: https://sites.google.com/view/sourcesgeoengineering By the end of the 21st century, humanity is becoming desperate. Decades of heatwaves and droughts have led to unusually poor harvests, while the warming oceans yield fewer fish each year. In the tropical zones, millions suffer from famine and resource wars have made millions more flee to the north. As things quickly get worse, in an act of desperation, the world's governments decide to enact an emergency plan... It is far from certain that a grim scenario like this will play out. But the failure of world leaders to effectively address climate change, makes it far from impossible. So in the near future it might become necessary to try something radical to slow down rapid climate change: Geoengineering. Interventions so massive in scale that they might undo centuries of human behavior. Or make everything much worse. What is geoengineering, is it really an option and what if it goes wrong?

I’ve published more than 200 scientific papers. For 30 years I taught at MIT, during which time the climate has changed remarkably little. But the cry of “global warming” has grown ever more shrill. In fact, it seems that the less the climate changes, the louder the voices of the climate alarmists get. So, let’s clear the air and create a more accurate picture of where we really stand on the issue of global warming or, as it is now called—“climate change.” There are basically three groups of people dealing with this issue. Groups one and two are scientists. Group three consists mostly, at its core, of politicians, environmentalists and the media. Group one is associated with the scientific part of the United Nation’s International Panel on Climate Change or IPCC (Working Group 1). These are scientists who mostly believe that recent climate change is primarily due to man’s burning of fossil fuels—oil, coal and natural gas. This releases C02, carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere and, they believe, this might eventually dangerously heat the planet. Group two is made up of scientists who don’t see this as an especially serious problem. This is the group I belong to. We’re usually referred to as skeptics. We note that there are many reasons why the climate changes—the sun, clouds, oceans, the orbital variations of the earth, as well as a myriad of other inputs. None of these is fully understood, and there is no evidence that CO2 emissions are the dominant factor. But actually there is much agreement between both groups of scientists. The following are such points of agreement: 1) The climate is always changing. 2) CO2 is a greenhouse gas without which life on earth is not possible, but adding it to the atmosphere should lead to some warming. 3) Atmospheric levels of CO2 have been increasing since the end of the Little Ice Age in the 19th century. 4) Over this period (the past two centuries), the global mean temperature has increased slightly and erratically by about 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit or one degree Celsius; but only since the 1960’s have man’s greenhouse emissions been sufficient to play a role. 5) Given the complexity of climate, no confident prediction about future global mean temperature or its impact can be made.

The island off the coast of Venezuela is feeling the impact of climate change and pollution. Julieta is moved to take action. The teenager is fearless when it comes to saving animals. Turtles are an endangered species. Warming oceans are fueling algae growth, as are fertilizers flushed into the sea from Brazil. The turtles come up for air, and get entangled in the bloom. Julieta and her fellow activists from an island conservancy group are committed to saving as many turtles as they can. Their efforts are backed by veterinarian Odette Doest and her emissary for conservancy, Bob the flamingo. ------------------------------------------------------------------- DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

This promising new route provides a welcome opportunity to bypass the far longer southern route that connects Korea, Japan, and China with the West, through pirate-infested waters. The southern route, which carries 90% of petroleum, fishery products, and other trade, is a vital lifeline for Asia, but a northern route through the Bering Sea and across the North Pole is 40% shorter and could be a boon for trade. The Russians are leading the race for a safe summer route that travels through their newly booming ports, but other countries, including Japan, Canada, Germany, and Korea, are catching up. As the ice melts each summer, these countries are stepping up to find a profitable way to take advantage of an unexpected benefit of global climate change. ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ Subscribe Free Documentary Channel for free: https://bit.ly/2YJ4XzQ Join the club and become a Free Documentary Patron: https://www.patreon.com/freedocumentary Facebook: https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG Twitter: https://bit.ly/2QlwRiI ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ #FreeDocumentary #Documentary #IceRace ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬ Free Documentary is dedicated to bringing high-class documentaries to you on YouTube for free.

CONTENT: Temperature Will Rise: Climate models predict that Earth’s global average temperate will rise in the future. For the next two decades warming of about 0.2° Celsius is projected. If we continue to emit as many, or more, greenhouse gases, this will cause more warming during the 21st Century than we saw in the 20th Century. During the 21st Century, various computer models predict that Earth’s average temperature will rise between 1.8° and 4.0° Celsius (3.2° and 7.2° F). The amount of predicted warming differs depending on the model emissions scenario (how much greenhouse gas emissions it assumes for the future). The amount of predicted warming also differs between different climate models. Climate change is predicted to impact regions differently. For example, temperature increases are expected to be greater on land than over oceans and greater at high latitudes than in the tropics and mid-latitudes. Changing Precipitation: Warmer average global temperature will cause a higher rate of evaporation, causing the water cycle to “speed up”. More water vapor in the atmosphere will lead to more precipitation. According to models, global average precipitation will most likely increase by about 3-5% with a minimum increase of at least 1% and a maximum increase of about 8%. Yet, changes in precipitation will not be evenly distributed. Some locations will get more snow, others will see less rain. Some places will have wetter winters and drier summers. Melting Snow and Ice: As the climate warms, snow and ice melt. The amount of summer melting of glaciers, ice sheets, and other snow and ice on land are predicted to be greater than the amount of winter precipitation. The amount of sea ice (frozen seawater) floating in the ocean in the Arctic and Antarctic is expected to decrease over the 21st Century too, although there is some uncertainty as to the amount of melt. Rising Sea Level: A warmer climate causes sea level to rise via two mechanisms: (1) melting glaciers and ice sheets (ice on land) add water to the oceans, raising sea level, and (2) ocean water expands as it warms, increasing its volume and thus also raising sea level. During the 20th Century, sea level rose about 10 to 20 cm (4 to 8 inches). Thermal expansion and melting ice each contributed about half of the rise, though there is some uncertainty in the exact magnitude of the contribution from each source. By the year 2100, models predict sea level will rise between about 20 and 50 cm (8 to 20 inches) above late 20th Century levels. Thermal expansion of sea water is predicted to account for about 75% of future sea level rise according to most models. Acidic Ocean Water: Earth's oceans are predicted to act as a buffer against climate change by taking up some of the excess heat and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This is good news in the short run, but more problematic in the long run. Carbon dioxide combined with seawater forms weak carbonic acid. Scientists believe this process has reduced the pH of the oceans by about 0.1 pH since pre-industrial times. Further acidification of 0.14 to 0.35 pH is expected by the year 2100. More acidic ocean water may cause problems for marine organisms. Impacts on Ocean Currents: Large-scale ocean currents called thermohaline circulation, driven by differences in salinity and temperature, may also be disrupted as climate warms. Changes in precipitation patterns and the influx of fresh water into the oceans from melting ice can alter salinity. Changing salinity, along with rising water temperature, may disrupt the currents. In an extreme case, thermohaline circulation could be disrupted or even shut down in some parts of the ocean, which could have large effects on climate.

Sea levels have been rising at a greater rate year after year, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates they could rise by another meter or more by the end of this century. As National Geographic showed us in 2013, sea levels would rise by 216 feet if all the land ice on the planet were to melt. This would dramatically reshape the continents and drown many of the world's major cities.

Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg makes his debate debut, as Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders takes the lead in the polls. Just three days before the crucial Nevada caucuses, Democratic candidates took the stage in a contentious debate, firing off rounds of attacks on newcomer Mike Bloomberg. Former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and former New York Mayor Bloomberg spent two hours Wednesday night duking it out at the Paris Las Vegas Hotel & Casino. It was the ninth overall debate – and the most pugnacious. But it was the first that featured Bloomberg, who doesn’t take campaign contributions and did not qualify for previous ones because he didn’t meet donor thresholds. The debate opened with Warren and Sanders, who have built their campaigns around the promise to reduce wealth inequality, throwing jabs at Bloomberg, who has spent about $400 million of his personal fortune on campaign ads. since joining the race in late November. Despite his presence at the Nevada debate, Bloomberg is not on a ballot until Super Tuesday March 3. Sanders maintains a lead in national polls and held a 19-point edge in Nevada, according to a survey released Monday. The Nevada caucuses could present an opportunity for Biden, who maintained the lead for months, to bounce back against Sanders. However, Biden, the former front-runner, came across as mostly an afterthought in Wednesday’s debate. He is at risk of underperforming in Nevada on Saturday and the South Carolina primary on Feb. 29, after he flopped in Iowa and New Hampshire.

Trump has blamed poor forest management for the deadly fires, though many of the blazes have roared through coastal chaparral and grasslands, not forest. When addressing reporters after exiting Air Force One, Trump was asked if climate change was also part of the problem, in combination with forest management. Trump said he thinks, "a lot of things are possible." But he says when it comes to forests, downed trees and dried leaves on the ground eventually "just explode." The president said countries in Europe don't have the same issues with wildfires because they manage their forests. "So we have to do that in California," he said. Inside, during a meeting with officials on the fires, California Gov. Gavin Newsom accepted that his state can do a better job of forest management. But he told Trump that it is "self-evident that climate change is real and that is exacerbating this." Wade Crowfoot, secretary of the California Natural Resources Agency, argued that "if we ignore that science and sort of put our heads in the sand and think it's all about vegetation management, we're not going to succeed together in protecting California." Trump replied: "It'll start getting cooler. You just watch." Crowfoot said, "I wish science agreed with you." Trump got in the last word of the exchange: "Well, I don't think science knows actually."

By generating a holistic understanding of Earth’s ecosystems, we transform our ability to understand climate change, and identify the best strategies to address it. With this in mind, Crowther and his team of 25 researchers are looking at ways to digitally explore the biosphere and reveal the true potential of nature-based solutions in the fight against climate change and biodiversity loss. Advances in data collection and artificial intelligence are revealing more truths about our environment and the seriousness of climate change. At the same time, it’s also helping to find new solutions that harness the power of nature itself. The Crowther Lab research is helping organizations understand the true value of nature, make more informed decisions, and start implementing nature-based solutions to climate change and biodiversity loss. Get ready to discover a new approach to Climate Change. Thomas Crowther, professor of Global Ecosystem Ecology at ETH Zurich and founder of the Crowther Lab is different to most environmental scientists. While most labs in the world focus on one field of research, Crowther firmly believes that to understand the ecological processes that influence climate change, predict its progression with high accuracy, and develop nature-based solutions to address it, we need to take a holistic approach. Specialising in ecosystem ecology, Crowther is also the chief scientific advisor to the UN’s Trillion Tree Campaign. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Asset managers can do this by investing in companies seeking solutions to global warming, such as decarbonization, and by using active ownership to pursue real change. Having a clearly defined strategy is key to meeting this challenge. Lucian Peppelenbos, Climate Strategist, outlines some of the major initiatives impacting investors and the steps that Robeco has taken to develop a climate strategy.
