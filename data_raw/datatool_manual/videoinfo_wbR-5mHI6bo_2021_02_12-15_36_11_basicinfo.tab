title	Is It Too Late To Stop Climate Change? Well, it's Complicated.
description	A special thanks to the team at Our World for helping us out with data and research! https://ourworldindata.org/ Sources & further reading: https://sites.google.com/view/sources-climate-solve/ This video is part of a series about climate change supported by Breakthrough Energy – a coalition founded by Bill Gates, that is working to expand clean-energy investment and support the innovations that will lead the world to net-zero carbon emissions. https://www.gatesnotes.com/Climate-and-energy?WT.mc_id=20200625100000_ClimateCtr2020_CTRKurt-YT_&WT.tsrc=CTRKurtYT Climate Change is just too much. There is never any good news. Only graphs that get more and more red and angry. Almost every year breaks some horrible record, from the harshest heat waves to the most rapid Glacier melt. It’s endless and relentless. We have known for decades that rapid Climate Change is being caused by the release of Greenhouse Gases. But instead of reducing them, in 2019 the world was emitting 50% more CO2 than in the year 2000. And emissions are still rising. Why is that? Why is it so hard to just stop emitting these gases?
