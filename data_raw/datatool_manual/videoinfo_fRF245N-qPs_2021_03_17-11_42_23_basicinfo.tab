title	Amazon Rainforest To Stop Processing CO2
description	When will the Amazon rainforest stop processing carbon dioxide? It could happen much sooner than you think. John Iadarola breaks it down on The Damage Report.

The Amazon could turn into a source of carbon in the atmosphere, instead of one of the biggest absorbers of the gas, as soon as the next decade, owing to the damage caused by loggers and farming interests and the impacts of the climate crisis, new research has found. If that happens, climate breakdown is likely to become much more severe in its impacts, and the world will have to cut down much faster on carbon-producing activities to counteract the loss of the carbon sinks. “We’ve found that one of the most worrying impacts of climate change has already begun,” said Simon Lewis, professor in the school of geography at Leeds University, one of the senior authors of the research. “This is decades ahead of even the most pessimistic climate models.”" #TheDamageReport #JohnIadarola #TheYoungTurks
