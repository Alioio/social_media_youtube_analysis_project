I would say that this is really the biggest thing you can do, if you have a good amount of money. I really wonder, why no one talks about this. There are a lot of ways to do it. 1. Change to a bank that does not support fossil fuels but wind and solar, child labour and inhuman working conditions. 2. You will have an even greater impact if you choose to invest in an green ETF. You can also invest in ETF that only hold shares in green energy companys or house isolation etc. 3.Investing in your local wind or solar park and profit from the revenu (dont know if this is possible in the US)	UC7c3VtV9kLB2nCwWUnPXUFA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7c3VtV9kLB2nCwWUnPXUFA	1	UgwxNiDNMCQMC9znSPV4AaABAg	Our Changing Climate

Multinational corporations like Shell, BP, Mcdonalds ect. operate as they do today because they are relatively unregulated, but this requires the politicians and public perception to be on their side. Television programs have been tailored to appease the cable companies who depend on these companies advertisements for funding, achieving this goal. They are linked arm and arm towards enabling climate change. We are currently in a phase where companies are transitioning into green washing, where they mention sustainable products and recycling or that they are a climate conscious company, however the largest companies such as coca-cola are continuing to pollute at the same rate as they always have. My point? Taking climate change as a joke was always going to happen. Exxon mobile learnt of the dangers of climate change in the 70's (before the rest of the world caught on), but because it would effect their bottom line they decided to use propaganda such as adverts in newspapers designed to look like real articles to dissuade the general public from taking it seriously, and all of the other companies followed suit.

Now most of what I see is more "Okay, global warming exists, and okay humans cause it, but you know, I don't think it's so bad." Which is unfortunate because it's less of a science discussion and in so far that it is, it's a much more complex discussion that involves other kinds of projection. It's neat that you're able to have a conversation with your boss about it. These conversations can often quickly devolve into shouting matches. Especially when one person is in an authority position. But, in general you can get people from "Okay it exists, but humans aren't causing it" to "okay it exists and humans are causing it" by... 1) establishing that it is currently being driven primarily by CO2. 2) establishing CO2's rise is anthropogenic Neither of these are tough to prove to a skeptical person as long as they are having the discussion in good faith and they aren't super conspiratorially minded. The link between CO2 and climate can be established by demonstrating the historical link between the two and the current link between the two. Even when climate was driven by other factors, CO2 comes along for the ride. And when CO2 is driven up, climate comes along for the ride. We have strong evidence going back 800,000 years. The two are inextricably linked. CO2 can be established as currently anthropogenic through multiple lines of evidence as well. We can estimate the amount of carbon humanity is belching out into the atmosphere and we know the total size of the atmosphere, and we can estimate the amount of carbon the environment is taking back, so pretty simple math there. And there is an easy check on the math. Geologic carbon has a different ratio of carbon-14 than atmospheric carbon. So we can test the atmospheric carbon over time and see that is trending exactly as would be expected.

That&#39;s why people who watch these kind of shows don&#39;t take it seriously, they want to relax and have a good laugh after hard day at work or meal with the family. None of these shows would last long if you talked about certain topics to seriously..<br /><br />The Good Place is an example where it tried to<br /><br />Joe a minor character is an environmetalist who was trying to recruit/invite Eleanor one of the climate change groups but refuses and bickers that it&#39;s not real/it&#39;s a scam. Right after a pile of shopping carts slams into her and she dies.<br /><br />In alternate timeline/reality when Eleanor gets a 2nd chance in life, this time wants to become a better person. She joins the campaign with Joe and puts the effort into it. However, she gets tired of it and ends quitting anyway. People tend to stop when it gets too complicated or it takes a long time to solve.<br /><br />From the start to season 3 it pulls you in and makes you stay with comedy and adventures of 6 main characters but in the last part of the series it makes you think about certain things about your life/morality etc. It was the right time for it to end because it would&#39;ve gotten way to philosophical for a comedy tv series.

Most of humanity wants things delivered on a silver platter or takes little effort to get what they want. Also media and hollywood play a big role in this, complacency. I agree with your last statement.. We all wanna be winners but most of us aren't so why even try.. Eleanor tried and maybe I think that she turned out into a better person after she died, it's just when no one cares enough about your cause or what you fight for, you ask yourself why should I care so much when most people don't think it's even true(climate change, why bother?)

I&#39;m specifically depressed thinking about how the &quot;Obnoxious Activist&quot; character type has had a large part in setting back any sort of social progress, manbearpig being one of the worst examples. <br /><br />I&#39;m not sure how accessible spanish language media would be for you, but I&#39;d suggest looking up chilean puppet show 31 Minutos. It&#39;s not the focus of the show, but in nearly every single episode there is a segment on ecology and nature and everything branching out from it that has done a lot to teach latinamerican kids of my generation all the way from 2003 to today on these topics. Some of the episodes have english subtitles on the official channel, so I&#39;d suggest taking a look at their Green Note segments, presented by the red rabbit Bodoque.

And knowing how comedy writers frame the climate change issue is relevant if we wish to change minds. But I&#39;d like to focus on the nature of comedies as a form of entertainment. To me, the purpose of a comedy is to depict man as much worse than he is. It is not be taken as mere propaganda (though it could, as you&#39;ve shown, downplay the issue). In some of the examples you&#39;ve shown, to me, these are instances of satire and completely acceptable. I&#39;d like to think that these comedies don&#39;t take themselves too seriously and we as part of an audience are expected to do the same. I do acknowledge however, that it&#39;s another thing if people misconstrue or interpret the comedy in less constructive ways which might lead to indifference to this very real issue.

I think this categorisation is utterly wrong, as the character in question is neither low-status nor an outsider, but one of the main characters from the first season. It also does not present the goal of recycling and zero-waste as unreachable, but gives an rather clear path: 1. Get a worm farm for composting leftovers in-house. (Btw. these things are awesome) 2. If possible buy from stores without wrapping plastic 3. Use sustainable soap 4. Don't be a blind consumer and only buy what you need. The series is obviously a comedy, so they go the extra mile, by forcing the main character (who by the way only wanted to have a green image, but said environmentalist character decided to only help him if he actually practiced what he preached) to do some more ridiculous things like reusing waste water. But even here they do not present it as impossible or ridiculous, but just as something way outside the comfort area of the characters. They even discribe the required steps (install a tank and reroute the water). Finally there are two characters not in the main cast, which discuss the same issues on a "normal" level as consumers and even reiterate some of the points above like not buying stuff one does not need.

And I am STRONG opposer of radicalism, any radical, extremist revolution that violates freedom and gives people no choice or option to modify or stop it. for me a drastic revolution that makes little progress in short term is not a viable option that I can support. I prefer a change that comes in time, not rushed and forced. For example I am not against women getting voting rights because it is a "revolution" with clear objective and clear end-point. Lets say we do revolution to stop plastic use.... OK then how do we , for example, vaccinate people? Plastic is VASTLY used in medicine and no you cannot substitute it. At least not today and not at any cost that would be reasonable. Ok so what is the revolution you can offer me then?

Oddly though, I think what South Park did by trying to make Al Gore the cool guy (in apology) was ultimately wrong. Al Gore to me did lie. He did exaggerate facts, outright lied on some issues and charged inordinate amounts of money to have people hear him speak. He, to me, is a shuckster.<br /><br />What they should&#39;ve done is created an episode which said &quot;we were right to be skeptical about Gore&#39;s methods and motives, here&#39;s the real hero (insert a genuine person fighting for change) and the issue is real.&quot;<br /><br />Also, satirising the militancy of some folks isn&#39;t bad to me. But the complete ambivalence of those who don&#39;t care also needs to be satirised. Satire is helpful, but not if we&#39;re only beating down on low status folks, as you&#39;ve very clearly noticed.

Ambivalence (I.e. it‚Äôs none of my business who you‚Äôre attracted to) doesn‚Äôt require mental effort.<br /><br />Global warming activism requires the opposite. Moving people from the ‚Äúnot worry‚Äù state to the ‚Äúworry‚Äù state.<br /><br />Comedians are by their nature deconstructive. This can great for tackling long held views in society that need to go away, hence the phrase ‚Äù*punching* up‚Äù. The punch is towards something that needs to be metaphorically brought down.<br /><br />How do you frame global warming as punching up? You can‚Äôt. You‚Äôre stuck being forced to either preach or use neutral comedy right before a non comedic preach.	UCs5s-JT5Sb6P2mNChB7y3OQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs5s-JT5Sb6P2mNChB7y3OQ	0

They want to improve the shows, not necessarily cancel them all together. You, on the other hand, are saying one should not be thinking critical about comedy shows. You say that OCC should not state that highly influencial and super popular TV shows should take their responsibility to not enforce harmful stereotypes. I think we can all look back on how black people were depicted decennia ago, and say that's racist. Or is that cancel culture for those tv-programs too? That we now say similar things (like "that's racist" or "that's harmful for the environment") about current tv-shows is suddenly cancel culture? I think you underestimate how influencial popular tv-shows are on how "the regular average person" sees the world. As long as comedies show recycling and being vegetarian as something only "crazy obnoxious extremists" do, people will feel like that's actually true. That it's actually scary to speak up in your friend group about wanting to separate your garbage or to actually eat vegan. There are really enough people that won't buy that electric car, because they are afraid to be laughed at for it. Caring about the planet is depicted as something "uncool" and that will not change without the tv-series. Think about how your parents or neighbours will first react if you would some day come home and say you want to eat vegan for the climate. That's not based on facts, but on culture, and popular tv creates our culture.	UC3QOvAzHakOAsUQTirSNbww	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3QOvAzHakOAsUQTirSNbww	1	Ugx0o6ZL2ksL6YuPDlV4AaABAg	Ise River

She&#39;s disheartened to see a hundred other grants for the same thing and thinking she won&#39;t get it. At the end of the episode though, she publicly announces that she&#39;ll start the clean up on her own without the grant. People can join or not, but she&#39;ll be there trying to make a difference. It&#39;s a good example of bringing the environmental fight to the local level and just starting even if no one else is.

I get that climate change isn&#39;t brought up a lot in mainstream comedies, but it seems a little misleading to present it as though all your points are based around this one study, when the graph you are showing doesn&#39;t really seem to have much data to show.<br />I agree with all of your points, but idk it feels a little off.

The work is done by thousands of volunteer scientists and the wording of the reports have to be approved by UN representatives from over 100 countries. As such https://ipcc.ch/sr15 is probably the single most important document on climate science that exists and can answer both those questions	UCkbIuePVT_66GAt5D8a8TLw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkbIuePVT_66GAt5D8a8TLw	1	UgwQwoG3dhTXWlv_9RZ4AaABAg	Dolgaceva Irina

Ugw4T0CwILYVolFLuV94AaABAg	8	1	2020-12-18 14:08:57	Luca Pepel	So let me get this straight:<br />The purpose of comedy movies should be to promote your agenda and not make people laugh. I understand the temptation but climate change experts are not known to be funny, being funny is the job of comedians. Just let the experts do the talking and stop trying to indoctrinate others with such subtle techniques. Though I must admit the &quot;get them while they are young&quot; idea is pretty smart. If you dont want people to hate you (climate alarmists) then dont confirm the stereotypes, you are only making things worse (for yourselves) by advocating for &quot;climate correctness&quot; in movies and TV shows.<br />The same thing happened to feminism and lets just say that most movies promoting the third wave of feminism are not comedic masterpieces.

The guy making those claims is Scott Stephens, a well respect professor of fire science. If you disagree with him then you must have some counterarguments. Just using the genetic fallacy in order to discredit the article is intellectually dishonest. Even if a alt right professor said it ( and this guy is a leftist ) it would not make any difference. Yes the site is crappy but as long as you cant find any counterarguments and you dont want to have the discussion that makes you bigoted. There I was thinking that the democrats were the party of science and rationality ( another good example of the genetic fallacy ).

The people that want to drastically change the world that we live in, because of climate change , are alarmists.
