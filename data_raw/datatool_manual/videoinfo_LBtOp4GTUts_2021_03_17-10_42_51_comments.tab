In the past I voted for Republicans like Governor Engler (regretted that one) and HW Bush - not much regret there, and others. Today, I will not vote for a Republican dog catcher. The party as a whole has become too corrupt and amoral to give them even an ounce of power. This is not to say that they CAN'T be good - my one run at office was prompted by a Republican stat rep - even though he knew my leanings are liberal and I would run as a Democrat. I lived in a district so red that the incumbent had run unopposed for years for state Senate. This Republican told me, "We may disagree on a lot, but you are a good man, and you MIGHT beat him, and I will take a good liberal over a corrupt conservative any day." . That was 25 years ago, and he was newly retired then, and at 91 is planning to vote straight Democrat in 2020.

Governments can CREATE the markets that can drive businesses to innovate. We would not have seen the advances we have in electric cars if governments had not subsidized them for a long time (and still are) to create a market by keeping the price from being too unreasonable. Or take the internet - which Al Gore get's undeserved flack over - he and other legislators laid the groundwork for transforming the Defense Department's Arpanet into the modern internet, and passed laws to encourage the proliferation of higher speed data lines around the nation - that made it a commercial opportunity. The job of a leader is to listen, and to point the way, and facilitate efforts to get there - not to do all the technical innovations you dipshit.

A good leader builds bridges with opponents and LISTENS to smart people. One of the first things Biden did was to team up with Bernie and some of the others and craft a plan for the future. And you can see that he listened, because a lot of his policies now are more progressive than he originally had in mind. Years ago Anthony Fauci spoke with great respect about Biden's leadership of the H1N1 pandemic task force. He basically laid out the administration's priorities - the goals - minimize deaths and economic and social disruption the the greatest degree possible. But he told them that unless these experts could not come to an agreement about a course of action to achieve those goals and balance the priorities, his job would be as the facilitator - getting them what they needed to do what the administration needed them to do. That's what good, wise leaders do. And it worked very well.	UCTWInaragf2dDBqKxPcd1NQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTWInaragf2dDBqKxPcd1NQ	1	Ugw-Yyp7XpV8G5itxXZ4AaABAg	Moist

Yes, a lot of people have and are suffering and dying because of the Trump -lack of- administration. But how many black people would continue to die if the blatant racism of the GOP hadn't been exposed? Do you _really_ think that the Defund the Police movement would've gained traction under Hillary? Obama actually sent more military equipment to local law enforcement agencies. And there was this overall sense of "well, we elected a black president, racism is solved". Trump proved it wasn't. There were actual bills passed to limit presidential powers, that he had to sign because they were veto-proof. . Sure, there is a lot of speculation in my comment, that's why it's a youtube comment and not a Master's dissertation, but it's informed speculation. You yourself said "it shows the US can easily become an authoritarian regime". Assuming he leaves/is forced out by the Secret Service in January, coming close to a dictatorship is actually a great way to show the need to scale back the decision power of the president and a return of that power to congress. . Next step would be to limit the number of terms someone can serve in congress itself. I mean, "John Doe has been a representative for 30 years" is just bizarre.

The reality is we need a societal change then only then can a systematic change work. As long as we have so many people upholding the system we can‚Äôt force people into socialism and being accepting of everyone. So it might be good to have this behavior so blatantly shown. But it also shows a lot of much smarter people that it‚Äôs very easy to turn the US into an authoritarian regime that hasn‚Äôt been possible before.

Al Gore would‚Äôve been a lot better in the short term, as would Hillary, but those two morons exposed *A LOT* of flaws in the United States‚Äô political and electoral systems. Without Bush, Obama wouldn‚Äôt have been elected, even if a democrat had, the party wouldn‚Äôt have nominated a black man. He was the response to Bush II: the cool, black guy who you‚Äôd love to sit down and smoke a joint with, as contrasted with the imbecile who reads a book upside down and you can ‚Äúfool three times‚Äù. But let‚Äôs be real: Obama had a lot of disastrous policies, especially when it comes to foreign ones. Again, better than Bush was and McCain would‚Äôve been, but not perfect. And he made a lot of great reforms, but didn‚Äôt actually bring structural change. Without Trump, there wouldn‚Äôt have been Me Too, we wouldn‚Äôt be talking about immigration the way we are, we wouldn‚Äôt be talking about limiting presidential powers, we wouldn‚Äôt be talking about defunding or abolishing police, and most of all: there would not be an actual effort to end gerrymandering and abolish the electoral college. He puts in question the infallibility of the statesian constitution and founding fathers. Unfortunately, the Democratic Party didn‚Äôt use this opportunity to nominate someone like Warren, who would actually lead the efforts to change all of those things. But Biden, as idiotic as he is, can be used as a punching bag while the Vice President (let‚Äôs hope for Stacey Abrams!) actually governs.

As you¬†climb¬†a mountain to a higher¬†altitude¬†(height), the¬†atmosphere¬†gets¬†thinner¬†and¬†thinner. This is because air pressure decreases with¬†altitude. Even though warm air rises, as it does so the rising air expands and cools. When it expands and cools, it can't¬†absorb¬†and¬†retain¬†heat the way it does at the bottom of the¬†mountain. Although mountaintops are closer to the Sun, they're also farther away from the¬†thermal¬†heat of the Earth's¬†core¬†that keeps the ground warm. So the top of the mountain can be much colder than the bottom. In fact, the bottom of a mountain can be located in a¬†tropical¬†jungle while the top of the mountain has snow on it! That's why it's possible to have snow at the¬†equator. Cooler temperatures at the top of a mountain also mean that there's less¬†evaporation¬†taking place. This leads to greater amounts of moisture in the air. More moisture means more rain and, at the very top of a mountain, more snow. Not all mountains have snowcaps, and not all mountains that get snow have snowcaps all year. A lot depends upon their location and how tall they are. Mountains lower in¬†altitude¬†are less likely to have snowcaps or to have them all year long. Many mountains, though, have snowcaps year-round. Above a certain point ‚Äî called the snow line ‚Äî it stays cold enough that the snow never¬†melts.

How's it's been weaponised to disenfranchise people today by the Republican party today is because they're protecting those same interests as the Democratic Party before reconstruction. It doesn't matter what the party is called the interests are the same as they were in the 1700s.

Lots of factors contributed - Gore is boring, Gore says he invented the internet. The media running with that nonsense and not exposing that Bush was a failure as Texas governor and running with "guy you want to have a beer with" nonsense. Then you have Donnna Brazile and Bob Shrum running an awful campaign that never went into attack mode, ran away from Clinton and never once mentioned the Supreme Court. Such a brutal failure on so many fronts. And still, I never understood how anyone could look at Bush and choose him over Gore.

Hardly got any of them - and never got the main one! He probably could have in the first year when we had Bin Laden trapped in the caves of Tora Bora - but instead of sending in US forces to get him (our stated reason for BEING in Afghanistan) he left it to a local Afghani warlord. Not only were they not as competent and well equipped as our guys - but most of them LIKED Bin Laden - if they found him they would probably help him escape! And the Iraq war was purely about oil.

UgyrQi_kRF0ut2H4xfN4AaABAg.9BUsF5sTTfF9BVHMnHHYnw		0	2020-07-24 14:11:24	Lethgar Smith	I can explain the whole thing. George H. W. Bush was the former head of the CIA and before that he was certainly an agent although he has denied that his entire career. His father was instrumental in founding the agency and the CIA has long and deep ties to the Texas oil industry along with Project Paperclip, the clandestine operation to bring former Nazi scientist to the US. This is why a big part of NASA is in TEXAS. George H.W. Bush or Poppy Bush , as he would be come to be known as among the elite, would soon head the CIA's political assassination squad after his great work in helping coordinate the ground team in the Kennedy assassination. He was the "guy in charge" for the Bobby Kennedy job, the MLK job, the attempt on Reagan was a gamble to put himself in the oval office but it failed. It was supposed to coincide with another political assassination around the same time, that of John Lennon. This was all going to pave the way for Bush's New World Order as he would later coin the term in a UN speech. Things didn't quite pan out and he saw that he could not hold the popular vote so a substitute was provided in the form of the husband and wife CIA operatives, Bill and Hillary Clinton. You see, Poppy Bush has been in control of who sits in the Oval Office since 1980. He certainly was instrumental in seating his own son in the Oval office. The Clintons are CIA agents and have been since they were in college. The same goes for Barack Obama. He also was appointed by Poppy. Hillary was promised the next opening but Poppy died and his network collapsed. She and Leon Ponetta thought they could hold it together but there wasnt enough real popular support to pull it off and so Hillary feels like she "missed it by that much!" The end result of the sudden death of Poppy Bush and the control he had over our elections is evident in the result of the first election without him, Donald Trump. Trump never would have happened if Poppy Bush were still alive.	UCl-wqCD2t6o17B3_fTStzpg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl-wqCD2t6o17B3_fTStzpg	1	UgyrQi_kRF0ut2H4xfN4AaABAg	Dragana

Hoarding rare earth materials don‚Äôt make you better. You ARE wealthy. We‚Äôre all in this together, stop pretending you‚Äôre better. DO better. VOTE for better. Pay attention to more than just some simplistic calculation of your personal carbon footprint. One Earth is going to take a hell of a lot more than virtue signaling on YT.

(Jeremiah 7, Psalm 48, Romans 1-3...) God gave us His written word, originally in Hebrew and Greek, and called this book the Bible, to show us how to live and be; The Bible was written by holy men of old, many years ago, as God moved them through the Holy Ghost (2 Peter <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBtOp4GTUts&amp;t=1m21s">1:21</a>); And all scripture was written by inspiration of God, for us to be corrected, and reproved, by walking in His truth (2 Timothy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBtOp4GTUts&amp;t=3m16s">3:16</a>,17); We have a most loving, and merciful God, to be praised and obeyed, from the moment we arise, til we go to sleep at night, yet much of the world won‚Äôt take heed, and go their own way; (Psalm 113:3, Ezekiel 39, Jeremiah 12, Ephesians 5, Titus 3, 2 Timothy 3..... ) He is the King of kings, LORD of lords, He is our Savior, Creator of all, but most won&#39;t even acknowledge Him, and mock Him with much gall; We‚Äôre in the ‚ÄúGreat Tribulation‚Äù now of Matthew 24, the LORD has opened up the seals (Revelation 5-22), so we can see truth more; In Daniel chapter 12 vs 9, God told Daniel the seals were closed til the end of time; If you study from Isaiah to the book of Malachi, hopefully you will see that this is all about the end times; Too many false gospels, signs and wonders, none have the truth, since God has allowed Satan to take his seat in the temple, and now rules, according to 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 (2 Corinthians 11, Revelation 2,3, 17-22)Judgment has begun on the house of God, in 1 Peter chapter 4, God is starting with the churches, and then to many more; (Ezekiel 9, Jeremiah 25...) God is our Faith, our Baptism, our LORD, and Father of all, and only He can save, not the pope, priest, you, or me, and none can come to Him, unless He draws, and only by His mercy; (John <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBtOp4GTUts&amp;t=6m44s">6:44</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBtOp4GTUts&amp;t=10m30s">10:30</a>, Ezekiel 36, Romans 1-9, 1 Timothy 2:5, Titus 3, Ephesians 1-5...)So as the days of Noah, because of too much sin, when the floods came, and took most everyone/thing away, except for the animals on ark, and Noah&#39;s family of eight, So shall our LORD and Savior, Jesus Christ (both the same), come and destroy this earth with fire on the dreadful Judgment Day, with only a remnant saved (Isaiah 1, 10, 11, Jeremiah 23, 31, Ezekiel 6, Joel 2, Malachi 4, Romans 9, 11, 2 Thessalonians 1:7-9, Revelation¬† 11, 12, 18-22‚Ä¶.), and He alone is the Author and Finisher of our faith (Hebrews 12:2);Please come soon LORD Jesus, please come soon, let Satan and sin no longer rule, for many are suffering, more and more each day, especially the children, LORD we pray; Please come soon dear LORD, please come save (Revelation 18-22)<br /><br />Thank you for listening, may God bless, and keep you always!<br />Kathleen	UCCDeXATZbrIA2KvO5jGRG0g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCDeXATZbrIA2KvO5jGRG0g	0

The climatologists and people who you know, don&#39;t want to see the world end, are trying to raise the alarm as loud and as often as possible, because the evidence piling up is so sky high and the implications so dire (America has been laid low by what amounts to a roided up Common Cold virus (not minimizing, just commenting), imagine how a global climate crisis <b>is</b> going to play out), and other side (the morons) are so certain everythings a hoax, perpetrated by whatever version of the boogymen they want to blame for their own stupidity, and so emotionally invested in trying to make others feel bad, that they would happily walk into the fire if they thought it would cause even momentary discomfort for someone *else*. <br /><br />There&#39;s no coming back from this. it&#39;s over.

I have no idea what portion of that will be just Animal agriculture. Going vegan will help, but only a small amount. 65% is transport and power generation. this is what needs to change to have impact.

Did they have green technology ? Why did ancients irrigate ? Could it have been because of arid land ? Why did they conserve ? Wind mills kill many species of birds and migratory bats , start wildfires in California and solar panels destroy habitat and after the batteries and panels fail are extremely dangerous to recycle because of the levels of toxic substances used to manufacture them , and I must add do not produce much electricity in terms of need , so the answer you give AG is tax .. tax .. tax .. everything you propose will tax me , benefit someone else and will not produce enough energy to meet needs and are destructive to animals and the environment , I don‚Äôt think Al Gore is more evil than me or almost anybody else . But this nonsense has to stop , I know you will defend your position to the grave , but the honest intellectuals and scientists who have a reputation to maintain disagree with the ‚Äúgreen new deal‚Äù you and the ‚Äúnever had a good reputation‚Äù media continue to spew .
