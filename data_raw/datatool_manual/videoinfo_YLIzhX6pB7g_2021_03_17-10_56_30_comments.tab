But there's literally no evidence to prove that we humans are the ones who are causing it. 150 years is quite a long time. Despite that we haven't seen too many adverse or direct effects of it. We have just heard it on the news and perhaps noticed that summers are a little warmer and winters are a little colder. That's all. I don't understand this idea that humans are going to bring down the entire ecosystem within the next century. This idea is crazy. It's just making people panick and diverting them from real issues like poverty	UCSFKLOpt8kxaeBQ-JxRcLww	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSFKLOpt8kxaeBQ-JxRcLww	1	Ugy25FqMmnsW8wn96554AaABAg	R Schmidt

You have been dumbed down by the media's portrayal of a conspiracy theorist. scientists are not free thinkers, they work for organisations funded by government. They research what the fuck they are told to or they lose their job. Any scientist who doesn't follow suit or speaks out against the status quo; will be branded as a lunatic or CONSPIRACY THEORIST.

When you view graphs based on actual data, rather than climate model projections, or "adjusted" data, the picture becomes clearer and proves there is little reason to worry.

Here are some of the items in the list of evidence scientists have studied to elucidate this important question: - Simple chemistry – burning carbon-based materials releases carbon dioxide (CO2) (research beginning in 1900s) - Basic accounting of what we burn, and therefore how much CO2 we emit (data collection beginning in 1970s) - Measuring CO2 in the atmosphere and trapped in ice to find that it's increasing, with levels higher than anything we've seen in hundreds of thousands of years (measurements beginning in 1950s) - Isotopic analysis of the atmospheric CO2 revealing the increase is from burning fossil fuels (research beginning in 1950s) - Basic physics that shows us that CO2 absorbs heat (research beginning in 1820s) - Monitoring climate conditions to find that recent warming of the Earth is correlated to and follows rising CO2 emissions (research beginning in 1930s) [worryingly, CO2 emissions also rise spontaneously with warming. The two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, just as increasing wealth can drive increase stock purchases, and increased stock purchases can drive increasing wealth - which leads to runaway inequality] - Ruling out natural factors that can influence climate like the sun and ocean cycles (research beginning in 1830s) - Employing computer models to run experiments of natural versus human-influenced simulations of Earth (research beginning in 1960s) - Consensus among scientists who consider all lines of evidence and make their own conclusions (polling beginning in 1990s)	UCPbq_FVPR-zikEds1QhqWfA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPbq_FVPR-zikEds1QhqWfA	1	Ugz_-kZkIFMuvH2-NcF4AaABAg	michael daniel

Also for people who think that there are spikes of CO2 and heating that is because of natural causes like volcanos and etc. But that increase happened in a long period of time yet today we have reached that peak through a short amount of time.

It makes sense, greenhouse gases such as CO2 and CH4 are emitted. Therefore, they block the energy in the thermal store from exiting the atmosphere. As more deforestation and as the population increases, there is more consumption meaning more emissions. We can use those 2000 as a means of calculating previous climates. It's not that the earth had a consistently cold temperature, it's that there was no particular pattern. Whereas now, there is a pattern. As more greenhouse gases are emitted, the more the earth's average temperature increases. This is an experiment proving this.

That's why the question of whether we are causing it has been studied by tens of thousands of qualified and smart people. You are talking as if this single 90 second clip lays out all the evidence for every contention forming the basis for the consensus view. Here are some of the items in the list of evidence scientists have studied to elucidate this important question: - Simple chemistry – burning carbon-based materials releases carbon dioxide (CO2) (research beginning in 1900s) - Basic accounting of what we burn, and therefore how much CO2 we emit (data collection beginning in 1970s) - Measuring CO2 in the atmosphere and trapped in ice to find that it's increasing, with levels higher than anything we've seen in hundreds of thousands of years (measurements beginning in 1950s) - Isotopic analysis of the atmospheric CO2 revealing the increase is from burning fossil fuels (research beginning in 1950s) - Basic physics that shows us that CO2 absorbs heat (research beginning in 1820s) - Monitoring climate conditions to find that recent warming of the Earth is correlated to and follows rising CO2 emissions (research beginning in 1930s) [worryingly, CO2 emissions also rise spontaneously with warming. The two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, just as increasing wealth can drive increase stock purchases, and increased stock purchases can drive increasing wealth - which leads to runaway inequality] - Ruling out natural factors that can influence climate like the sun and ocean cycles (research beginning in 1830s) - Employing computer models to run experiments of natural versus human-influenced simulations of Earth (research beginning in 1960s) - Consensus among scientists who consider all lines of evidence and make their own conclusions (polling beginning in 1990s)	UCPbq_FVPR-zikEds1QhqWfA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPbq_FVPR-zikEds1QhqWfA	1	UgytoDkcd5VWMSghxqt4AaABAg	Ryan Wheeler

That's why you keep seeing that same old graph on TV with a climate alarmist like Al Gore pointing to CO2 levels over the last 10,000 years or so. Then they go on to say something along the lines of; When the Earth was cold in last Ice Age, CO2 was lower. When the Earth was warmer, CO2 was higher. You can see here on this graph I'm pointing a stick at from an ice core we dug up from the south pole, you climate skeptic right wing populist voting racists. It's CO2 I tell ya! *yawn* The whole CO2 is evil thing is based off that. When the Earth is cold there is less CO2, when it's hotter, there is more CO2. That graph does not conclusively prove, to me anyway, that CO2 is causing global warming. What it shows is a relationship between CO2 and temperature. That could al so mean there is more biological activity and more life, producing more CO2 during warm periods, because everything grows faster in a warmer climate. Who knows? Certainly not Al Gore or Extinction Rebellion drug addict weirdos.	UCXidMPfzglBaxjXhg2Fe3OQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXidMPfzglBaxjXhg2Fe3OQ	1	UgwJmN2FDVJiU_XRJe94AaABAg	Jean Bisson

All those car engines, jet engines, steam turbines, ship engines and so on, all those heat engines radiate a huge amount of heat into the atmosphere. A petrol engine only has a 25% efficiency at converting fuel into kinetic energy, the other 75% is lost as heat. I don't know how many BTU of heat a car radiates during a 1 hour drive but I'm guessing it's enough to heat your home all day in the dead of a snowy winter. If you add up the BTUs output by all those cars and other heat engines globally, I'd say it would be a very large number from all those 100's of millions of engines that we use every day. All that heat could be adding to global warming at the very least. I have not seen a study where anyone has run the numbers to see what all that extra man-made heat is doing to the atmosphere. It's all blamed on CO2, based on one conclusion found in an ice core from 200,000 years ago for some reason.

Nor does it illustrate a correlation between CO2 levels and either warming or sea level rise. In fact it does the opposite. But to understand this one actually has to KNOW something about the history of 20th century climate. From the beginnings of the industrial revolution until roughly 1950, CO2 levels were not high enough to have much of an effect on global temperatures. This FACT is acknowledged by most if not all climate scientists, who ascribe warming during this period to natural variation. From ca. 1940 to roughly1979, as clearly illustrated on the graph, there was no warming at all. Yet from 1950 on CO2 emissions were beginning to soar -- a clear example of counter-correlation. And from 1998 through ca. 2015 there was only a very slight increase, if any, in warming. And again, CO2 emissions were continuing to soar -- another anti-correlation. <br /><br />This graph has been used to mislead people into believing that there&#39;s been a steady upward trend in temperatures since the beginning of the 20th century due to CO2 emissions, but as is clearly the case, that is not at all true. As for sea levels, they rose at a relatively steady rate throughout this entire period, despite the mid-century cooling and despite the fact that temperature rise due to CO2 emissions could not have have any effect on sea level during the 1st 80 years of the 20th century, nor during almost all of the 21st, as I&#39;ve just explained.

The sample is too small and you can not control for variables which would be numerous and just impossible. Sorry to say there can never be defined or viable data due to this and that is why we are still arguing about it. Science and the scientific method is the thing that won&#39;t let it happen. I can accept the hypothesis but there can and never will be a conclusive consensus among scientists because no experiment can reach the threshold for it to become theory. Even without the control, correlation is not causation. True Science has to be done in a controlled environment. at least as controlled as we can get it. The less control the less viable any data is from testing the hypothesis. That is why climate science is actually psuedoscience, it is untestable, you can not isolate the thing you are testing in the environment or any other limitless variables. most people are too emotional, ignorant, or just low IQ to get it. I don&#39;t deny that co2 is raising temps but I digress. Prove me wrong please.	UC0Cl6eHynnkI-Blxlhc5dtg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0Cl6eHynnkI-Blxlhc5dtg	0

So the question is this, where the hell is the ocean rising and why isn&#39;t it rising everywhere like we&#39;d expect water to behave? If climate change is a &#39;settled science&#39; like we are told then why can&#39;t anyone present any empirical evidence to back up the claim?

What happens when you move 5-10M migrants into USA and Europe over 15 yrs. You increase the world’s carbon footprint by using more modern energy and trigger more adverse climate change.<br /><br />How do you square this?

Right, God said that (when man&#39;s knowledge increases, know u are living in last days), just over a hundred years ago we were still on horseback. Now look at us. This is one of many prophecies. U will find then, God warns us that the weather will change drastically in the last days., Since the beginning weather has down spiraled as we separate from God. He will return when the days are like Noah&#39;s time. Wow. Peace to whoever reads this. God&#39;s gonna do more damage to anything surrounding Israel then we will.

I'm also very educated particularly on our history and politics. Not the vanilla propaganda version, the real stuff. So when it comes to this invisible threat - the "just trust us" threat, I can't in any grown up, mature, thinking way - believe that little boy who cries wolf all the time. Not to get a rise out of us or get attention, but to extract money to fight the fake wolf. He even goes so far as to dress up as a wolf so others believe him. So basically this is that kid again and he's saying that the "climate is changing" and we are all going to have to pay to fix it. Get the F out of here kid. We have to fix so much more before we can even believe another main stream "expert" on anything, ever again. So to summarize - the world may indeed be burning from the inside out and I blame the corporations for that but if anyone is going to pay anything for it, it will be paid for with every last cent the billionaires have or stop talking about it because you are lying again and if you're not - let's all burn together. Not going to save this planet to buy you another thousand years of criminal rule. That's the thinking lefts position. BTW - the thinking left doesn't watch CNN, Faux or MSNBC etc.. Anything mainstream is propaganda and if you don't know it by now, it's time to wake up. You're planet might be cooking because you've let them have their way while you slept. If it's not cooking, it's certainly burning up with war and criminal rule and if you can't at least fix that - you can't even talk about invisible threats. And yes - I'm well aware that AOC and Bernie are controlled opposition fakes hired by the right wingers that run our world. They pushed their Romeny/Obamacare RIGHT WING health care wealth extraction scheme and called it Socialism everyday - remember? It's the complete opposite of anything Marxist. But you all let them force you to pay wildly inflated medical prices with no protection or representation under the guise of social welfare. This is the same - just another wolf in sheeps clothing and if you fall for this too - you are too dumb to talk to. .

Convince everyone we MUST act now or it will be too late (scare tactics can be quite effective). To pull off something as grand as this "New Deal" would require A) an insane amount of taxation - not just on the wealthiest, but on everyone - and B) a near complete government takeover in nearly every facet of our lives - the economy, healthcare, industry, manufacturing, agriculture, housing, transportation etc etc etc. It's all about power.
