Ugyt1BcOb5WL83iJyut4AaABAg	11	11	2019-09-19 14:30:49	The Economist	On Friday at 1:00pm GMT we are hosting a live Q&amp;A about the issues surrounding climate change. What do you want to ask our experts? Oliver Morton, a senior editor at The Economist who specialises in climate science and policy, and Sarah Collinson, the director of this film, will be live to answer your questions.

The problem is that it involves cows or megaherbivores. This is a problem because cows have been labelled the problem. The problem though has been the way they are currently managed.

To contribute, i resorting to collecting some of the local fallen acorn beech sycamore acorn n hazel nuts this autumn, currently holding them in fridge in an attempt to trick them into sprouting 1 season early inside my flat. Can seeding a forest with local compatible species n then letting nature take over be an effective shortcut to the natural rewilding? Concerned folk NEED to feel n see a tangible contribution Also, can u address why some folk have hopped onto the agenda 21, sun dimming, depopulation, carbon tax being a ponzi, heading for iceage (best argument being desalination killing gulf stream that warms NW europe) etc etc etc Cos its causing many to feel their efforts not needed Also gov subsidies in fossil fuels n why those companies not getting into renewables (they cld b our greatest assest if they wanted n still make profit, only gov subsidies keepin them competitive n thus keepin them from desire to change)	UCKYN_Q4NN7S76UGMTgDs90A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKYN_Q4NN7S76UGMTgDs90A	1	Ugyt1BcOb5WL83iJyut4AaABAg	The Economist

By the way, growing forests for all values including wood production is called "silviculture"- yet this subject is virtually ignored by all discussions of trees and climate.

They dont cost much and they would make everything look better and more appealing to be around. I know my country, Canada would actually send people in other countries to plant trees. My own family has planted over 3000 trees in 5 years. Some of them didn&#39;t grow and died so that is also to be accounted for.

A big piece of space rock blasts though occasionally and interrupts that ‚Äúflow‚Äù In a relatively short time, we get something very different. The last ice age ended in what is measured against the history of the earth, less than a blink of an eye. Maybe that was because of sun spots, or maybe because the crust moved slightly.

My city, Bangkok, use to be quite cold for months in winter, now not even a sign of cool air. There are severe deforestation around my country and around the world, one of the biggest, thickest and most dangerous jungle in the middle of my country disappear just in my lifetime and only tiny part of it was left as a national park, not to mention all of jungles north to south that are in the same situation.<br /><br />It is true that we can&#39;t solve this crisis with only planting trees but it is still important to plant them as much as we can , be it by nature or monoculture (at least for a short period until nature heals itself), as they are the only tool we have to take carbon from the air and store it in the ground, no man made machine could do that more efficiently and they also produce oxygen, lower ground temperature etc. It IS part of solutions and I don&#39;t think its enough to just let nature take care of itself alone at this time. At least, why not planting some first , local species, let it be mother tree then have nature do the rest? With all that tree planting, we also need to cut down carbon emission, use &quot;less&quot; plastic, use less fossil fuels, recycle our waste, and the list goes on.<br /><br />I don&#39;t quite understand why many people think it have to be &quot;A SINGLE&quot; solution. They wait, wait and wait for that magical solution and do nothing (even hinder other in many case), for me that&#39;s lazy and selfish. At my age, I don&#39;t think I will live long enough to see any improvement on this crisis but at least we must &quot;DO&quot; something now not just debating, thinking and researching.

Deforestation is real in my country and throughout my country north to south there is a noticable change in weather even in the country side faraway from the city, it is not what it use to be (40+ years ago). It may be local change (I don't deny it) but what happens locally will effect the whole system in one way or another and in turn the whole system will effect local system. World weather and nature don't have border it is always one complex system from combination of smaller subsystems. I like to think of it like a very complicate watches, one tiny rust gear will effect the whole movement, compare that to the situation where there are many rust gears, deforestations around the world, decates of burning of fossil fuel, constance undergeound coal mine burning, and many more, I believe that it is already a failed system and it will get worse. I may be wrong and I hope l was wrong, but so far I haven't seen any improvement on the situation at all.

It's like in a battle, facing ten times bigger army and defeat is unavoidable, then someone suggests, "Let's surrender. They may save us." The reality is that the enemy is thinking of mass execution of the POW. If we know it beforehand, we would fight to the last bullet and die in the battle no matter what(the results are the same). The consequence of climate change is just like that, mass execution, worldwide perpetual famine for next thousand of years. How many people out their really understand this? They have no idea our food supply is completely dependent on the climate. And that the nature will be kind to us no matter what.

Yet, hardly anyone asks foresters about trees- which is rather stupid. Of course, much forest management is very poorly done- and that needs to be acknowledged- then we need to move towards high quality forest management to both produce wood products while maintaining carbon in the forest. Here where I live, in Massachusetts, there are many fanatics who say we should never cut trees- but when I ask what will replace wood for homes, furniture, paper products- they have no response.

Trees provide so much more than structural elements of forests and carbon sequestration. Simplistic simulations which claim forest location can be detrimental similarly fail to consider nuance and the complexity of interacting larger earth systems. For instance an uninformed viewer could come away thinking that cutting down the taiga makes climate sense. Implying that trade-offs between other human uses for (now converted) formerly forested lands are somehow equivalent in value to the need to keep Earth habitable is irresponsible as well as unimaginative. We should be finding ways to meet such needs WHILE increasing forest and tree cover, not instead.	UCQ_PUB-B6QfoqTooVXFso0w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ_PUB-B6QfoqTooVXFso0w	0

You are living now, why not make your surroundings better if you have a choice?

No evolutionary advantage allows an animal to survive this. This is not natural and we will be long extinct before animals evolve that are adapted to the world we leave behind. We are destroying an evolutionary tree which may perhaps never regrow to anything quite so complex and sentient life is uncertain to reappear.

Left alone the earth can repair itself to a certain extent depending upon the conditions of the soil and availability of water and sunlight. Man can assist the earth by planting more trees and other types of vegetation especially in those areas that have been disturbed by development and if done using basic forestry and ecological practices (avoiding monoculture communities), we can begin to sequester vast volumes of CO2 and create equally vast amounts of O2 on the planet. Other strategies for human adaptation to changes in our world need to be pursued since some of the mechanisms involved in the eart&#39;h&#39;s changes are far beyond our ability to change or mitigate.

Frankly, the activity shown in this video is far too little and far too late.

To think that humans are the guardians or stewards of this Earth is preposterous when millions of years ago for hundreds of millions of years the dinosaurs, big and small, roamed this planet as compared to only 100,000 to 200,000 years of human existence. During the Jurassic period, millions of years ago, large dinosaurs were abundant. Carbon dioxide level was over 4 times higher during the Jurassic period than it its today.

Although, it just may be because Japan is temperate while Philippines is tropical, I believe maybe in the difference of culture Philippines has more experience with the green in our land. No offense to Japan, I love Japan! But this is just a message: Make your ways clean, but green.	UC2spwkZIof8m0rm1U36A_lQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2spwkZIof8m0rm1U36A_lQ	0

Then further we can steward, which is like mimicking nature or facilitating nature‚Äôs recovery. Like mycorrhized planting of natural diversity of trees outward from existing stands, or planting what will take these days. This will expand the hydrological cycle. Then moving agriculture to the periphery of extant stands of forests, planting orchardlike woodlands (like a grove with a canopy letting dappled light thru). Then in desert regions of full sun e.g. California can grow microalgae in photobioreactors. Fastest growing plant known makes oxygen and sequesters carbon quickly as needed to beat tipping points. Ending oil use would be an interesting transition	UCMImv9fVui7jSQTui10A8gA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMImv9fVui7jSQTui10A8gA	0

In fact, it's so obvious that it shouldn't really need saying. Without the sun, the Earth would be frozen. Without the atmosphere, the surface temperature would be about 30¬∞ C lower. Hence you can have cool temperatures due to weak solar output. Climate scientists know this ‚Äì in fact this kind of data on past climate is used to inform their calculations. 2. Look up "The Myth of the 1970s Global Cooling Scientific Consensus" by Peterson, Connolley and Fleck. Particularly pages 5 to 8. They looked at the number of papers from around that time which were predicting either cooling or warming. If you disagree with their conclusions, perhaps you can provide a list of papers which they missed. 3. Nice shifting of goalposts there. Your original claim was about predictions that "the Arctic glaciers would be melted by 2010". And your evidence for this is one scientist (which does not a consensus make) who made a rash prediction (in 2012) about Arctic summer sea ice (not glaciers) being gone by 2016. And the article you refer to is about visitor information signs (not exactly peer-reviewed science) regarding glaciers in a single national park, that is not in the Arctic, being gone by 2020.

I'm also not inclined to spend much time replying to someone who said "are you f-ing stupid????? grow the f- up u dumb s-t "(I hope you can see the irony in telling someone to grow up in the middle of reeling off a childish insult). So I'll just briefly respond to a few points. 1. Since the end of the last ice age, and prior to the industrial revolution, the Earth had been very gradually cooling. A while after the discovery of the greenhouse effect in the mid-19th-century, scientists began to speculate that the release of CO2 from the burning of coal might warm the Earth (look up Svante Arrhenius). The additional greenhouse effect means that there is an imbalance in the amount of energy entering (as sunlight) and leaving (as infrared) Earth. This inevitably results in a temperature rise, unless there is something to counteract it. If you believe that the Earth is warming naturally, it's on you to specify what the actual cause is ‚Äì and why the greenhouse effect (which is well-established physics and not all that complicated) is not affecting temperature. 2. In the 1970s the vast majority of scientific papers were predicting warming. However, the prospect of a new ice age was much more exciting to media at the time, hence why the media focused on the smaller number of papers which suggested calling. 3. Damage to the ozone layer has mostly stopped as strong regulations were imposed in order to phase out the chemicals which cause the most damage to it. However, it will take decades to recover to its previous state. 3. No reputable climate scientist predicted that "Arctic glaciers" would be gone by 2010. I put quotes around it because it's not clear if you're actually referring to glaciers ‚Äì the Arctic is mostly ocean, so perhaps you are referring to Arctic sea ice instead. 4. People in the developing world should be able to develop and have access to energy. That's why the initial focus of decarbonisation efforts has been on developed countries, who have already benefited from fossil fuel energy in the past and have enough wealth to invest more in lower carbon sources. This kind of investment can indirectly help developing countries in pursuing low carbon energy sources ‚Äì for example, thanks to massive investment in solar power, there are parts of the world where it's now more cost-effective to deploy solar energy than fossil fuel energy ‚Äì especially as solar can be deployed in a more distributed way, without having to place hundreds of miles of electricity cables to connect distant towns and villages to a centralised power station.

Do you agree that higher temperatures increases drought and that the groundwater levels drop? Maybe you can say which one you do not agree. Then, I can give evidence, it does. And why are you talking about evolution of the earth? Ofcourse the planet is going to survive, but is in our interest that things stay the same, so we can survive in the most comfortable way.

However, when co2 increases, the temperature increases, the groundwater level drops. Which means that the land is getting less fertile, which results in higher prices of food and drink water. So, economically it is also important to reduce co2 output. Please, do not call someone stupid, when you are obviously not a expert on this matter, either.

Cities need more trees. Many many many more trees. Plant fruit trees and feed your hungry mouths, why don&#39;t you? I live in the forest and I have both plantations and natural forests as my neighbours. I do not like the plantations but it is the fastest way to turn farmland into a natural old growth forest as long as the plantation is managed properly	UCYUQBu3Ef5qgWksKOA0iPjg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYUQBu3Ef5qgWksKOA0iPjg	0

So there is a lot of trees to be planted to recover ecosystems that will then again become carbon sinks. So yes, there is need to plant trees and then plant some more and expand those natural forest areas. If you recover the rainforest for instance and all the other forests harmed by human activities, just that recovery planting process can make a massive difference to climate change. &quot;How many trees would have to be planted for this recovery to be achieved?&quot; is a better question to ask.

Whilst native trees take longer to grow but they live longer in some cases up to 1000 years so they can store more CO2 compared to the quicker growing introduced Monterey pine which can grow quicker than natives.

We are closer to the poles and much colder then you are. If the boreal forest is warming this part of the world then lets have a lot more boreal forest. We have no shortage of snow cover. We have no forest shortage either. We are very very happy about warmer temperatures though. You are going about this all wrong if you think that localized warming is negative in any way.

But really also there‚Äôs a few phenomenal changes easing the temp extremes locally. One is called the polar vortex. I don‚Äôt understand it, but hear something to do with a screw up in ocean currents. It causes the extreme cold polar weather to shift south this way for sure. Maybe in the Asian direction too. That leaves the poles warming much faster than before. It doesn‚Äôt make it extremely cold here but temporizes it.

"The effect of global¬†climate change on¬†desertification¬†is complex and not yet sufficiently understood." https://www.greenfacts.org/en/desertification/l-2/7-climate-change-biodiversity-loss.htm. However this being said plant life thrives in the abundance of CO2 coupled with nitrogen rich soil. Agriculture is eroding this nitrogen stores making it a variable in plant growth. Your assumption that the ozone layer is eroding away due to desertification is incorrect. Since 2000 the ozone layer has regenerated at a rate of 1-3% per decade. However this being said this isnt as a resault of carbon dioxide. Coal, oil, gas, lime and chalk (both these being calcium carbonate coming from sea shells and crustations.) Where once carbon dioxide from the atmosphere consumed by plants which then died and over millions of years produced all of those things and burning coal, oil and gas is only just putting that CO2 back into the atmosphere for the plants to eat. https://ozone.unep.org/ozone-day/32-years-and-healing https://wattsupwiththat.com/2017/06/30/life-on-earth-was-nearly-doomed-by-too-little-co2/ You know that more CO2 will cause plants to consume less water bringing more moisture and fresh water into the soil and tablelands creating more fertile soil due to plants absorbing carbon dioxide and water vapour at a rate of 1 part carbon dioxide to 10 parts water vapour. Not only that but the increased temperature melting the ice caps evaporates more fresh water which will water arid and desert regeons further increasing vegitation. I dont think you're clear and i dont believe you're credible. Which is why i asked for sources because your statements are anecdotal.

Now 'nuf to say the only reason we use petroleum is only the already rich can afford to dig/drill way down and suck up the oil, just so they can mete it out, meter it out. This was foisted upon the people instead of using Tesla's free energy, still shrouded in military and corporate proprietary secrecy to keep us in this dirty pint-sized paradigm. The problem is petrol and clearcut logging has dislodged us from the natural carbon and hydrological cycle. The atmosphere is being reduced thru desertification to like that of the moon (uninhabitable to any life). That's the trajectory we're heading in. I'd suggest a different one. Who wouldn't and why?

Secondly, so what your saying is that lowering carbon dioxide will help? Do you know the level in parts per million it is for plant life to die? Its arround 150, we got to 180 during the last ice age. We had a greening event which this level got to 1000 parts per million, and there was no ice caps. Instead there was tropical plant growth up to alaska and algae growth in the north pole according to fossil evidense. So pretty much a rise in co2 increasing plant growth (if we stop deforresting) will infact help. This is my source. https://wattsupwiththat.com/2017/06/30/life-on-earth-was-nearly-doomed-by-too-little-co2/ And your right, it isnt just co2. The effects of water vapour and methane also have a greenhouse effect on the planet.

Added to that is the soil erosion from turned out to be stupid changes in agriculture (monoculture and tilling) that caused soil erosion into the oceans. By ocean convection black carbon gets kicked up near the equator, warmed it then gets carried by ocean currents to the arctic poles. This causes a melting of the polar caps from below, an even more inconvenient truth not told by Gore. Then the ozone layer prob never ended but only got omitted by the main scream media. The wiping out of biomass (trees included) on land and the F‚Äôing of the phytoplankton sources in the ocean have made it so we get insufficient oxygen floating up into the stratosphere to make O3 ozone. All this can be remedied if not for bullheadedness like yours	UCMImv9fVui7jSQTui10A8gA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMImv9fVui7jSQTui10A8gA	1	Ugx1qrany8J6IHRqTYV4AaABAg	Nick D

We are actually benefiting plant life on earth. If carbon dioxide levels gets too low it will kill all plant life. Take a greenhouse for example. Carbon dioxide levels get risen to 1000 parts per million to increas plant growth. We are at just over 400 parts per million today and in the last ice age when plant and animal life almost completely died off was at 180 parts per million. You are too lazy to do your own research outside of the media and bias chanels like this and gullable to believe in it.

So this planting trees all around is more like a finger crossed situation because they have no idea but it sounds cool.<br />The arrogance that these temp. intervals what they consider normal are the defaults of the earth is mind blowing.<br />The last ice age started 2,6 million years ago and started to become milder 19000 years ago until 11700 years ago was over.

They¬¥re both the same. We have destroyed it and keep on doing it. We have to respect the place we live in. The society we have invented is not nature-friendly. There are points where Nature CAN¬¥T repair itself: when it¬¥s about SYNTHETIC COMPOUNDS. In the case of Global Warming it would take a loooong time to reset things at the point when we &quot;touched&quot; Nature. There¬¥s a lot of CO2 already release which takes lots of years to be secuestred by photosynthesis. We have deforestated so much that we have to help natural processes to reforest, I believe. We have to go carbon negative as soon as possible. And in the case of pollution by synthetic compounds Nature doesn¬¥t have the &quot;tools&quot; for making them part of the system, so WE WILL HAVE TO HANDLE IT. Plastics, farming chemicals, gases like HCFCs, IT DEPEND ON US. PLEASE PEOPLE OPEN YOUR EYES. STOP AVOIDING YOUR PART OF RESPONSIBILITY ON THIS. STOP BLAMING AT GOVERNMENTS AND FACTORIES. WE, CONSUMERS, ARE BILLIONS. WE ARE ALL GUILTY (specially westernalized citizens). It will worth nothing if governments spend lots of money and emisions on the Energetic transition if we all don¬¥t learn WE HAVE TO CONSUME MUCH LESS ENERGY.

And going by with Professor Tabitha Skov is teaching how they count the cycles. By how many sunspots how long they last and when they start to diminish. And the Sun has a clean surface no activity.

A c m e that you talked about it was intermixed that had a flare and a CME at the same time. It's definitely behavior that is interesting. But yes yeah our climate always changes man. And we are being sucked by the great attractor a huge cluster of stars bright in a region of space that appears everything is moving to. Another interesting thing to me is we're gaining speed in space we can measure all that stuff. Which to me suggests and by everything that I know about electricity and magnets. That there's a we are magnetic is any thing else. The magnetics and electricity are dominating space and all around us. I'm investigating our past and it seems to me but there has been some history that has been taken from us and hidden. Knowledge that we should all know that is basic has been stripped from us. I strongly think it has to do with, knowledge on how everything works in a nutshell. Which makes life easy to live and he's ever changing climate events. Definitely something that we should be grouping together with. And we need a new organization that's going to take amazing care of our history records	UCTTUJs4es35AJYSZgFhm9Eg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTTUJs4es35AJYSZgFhm9Eg	1	UgwiW9YC6KM6jSCY_jJ4AaABAg	Heavy Metal Hair Salon

That's the high winds u mention. Space isn't meeting our standard of what we know as normal behavior, it's being eaten by dark matter. Our solar system as a whole is shifting locations in space always. This can also change how our planets operate. They're no humans on pluto and in the past 100yrs the weather has drastically change Ironically enough the climate change people believe that the weather is suppose to stay static which is funny and has never been true in the earth's history.
