UgyBq4AAx5hJT0JqNt94AaABAg.9EtbHGRfHcp9Ftf6NtCMPO		0	2020-11-10 20:54:12	SecretJanitor	@ViaTube The issue isn't that the climate is changing. It is and it always has. The planet has previously been far warmer (e.g. in the age of the dinosaurs) and far colder (e.g. in the most recent ice age). It's the RATE at which it is currently changing that is the issue. The Earth will be fine no matter what in the long-term, with or without us. It's us, human beings, and the plants and animals we have come to depend on, and the complex ecosystems that will be disrupted by abrupt change that are facing an uncertain future. Plants and animals, given enough time (depending on the species, a few years, a few hundred years, a few thousand years, or a couple million years) can adapt to almost anything or have descendants that eventually evolve into a different species that can handle changing conditions. The issue is that, we, humans, are making things change FASTER than they would on their own, at a pace that many plants and animals cannot possibly keep up with. Of note is that, because the Earth is covered by its oceans, about 1/3 of human-emitted carbon dioxide is actually being absorbed by the ocean (leading to ocean acidification, as carbon dioxide dissolved in water makes in portion carbonic acid which you may know in everyday life as carbonated water / soda). So in addition to the heat being absorbed by the oceans, we're making them more acidic (disrupting marine ecosystems which you may not be interacting with everyday, and, for instance, leading directly to coral bleaching). Even if the planet wasn't warming at all--even if the only worry was ocean acidification--several marine ecosystems that humans rely on could be disrupted by changing the pH level of the ocean so dramatically by 2100 (i.e. in 80 years, which is just one human lifetime). Oh but the climate most definitely is changing. There are two things to not about climate. Climate is the average of weather over a long period of time (e.g. compare this summer, to last year's summer, to a summer 10 years ago, to a summer 100 years ago, 1000 years ago, 10000 years ago, 1000000 years ago, etc.) while weather is what happened today. As the old adage goes, "climate is what you expect; weather is what you get."

I'll just say, regarding the "finite truths" of mathematics, I can summarise an infinite number of truths here for you in this reply. ∀a∈ℤ, (a+1)∈ℤ That summarises an infinite number of true statements. And those are just statements about adding 1. So I really have no idea what you're on about.

And as I said the first time, I, and anyone else with even a modicum of intelligence, will not debate anyone over anything as obvious as the proposition that 2+2=4. Those who disagree are welcome to say it is "debatable", but again, they should come to terms with the fact that people will rightfully ridicule them for it.

She not liked...by anyone, she was one of the first to drop out of the primary because she couldn’t even win her own state. Pretty sure she was the least least liked primary candidate. Her career has been made possible not by merit, but by exchanging sex/intimacy for an appointed public office, woke culture and their intersectional hierarchy/victimhood narratives, and then every single cultural institution propagandizing, censoring, and ultimately rigging the election for Biden. She’s not popular even despite all the nonsense legacy media and Big Tech parade.	UCUeDLVWl9u0NP24RCPHg-Bw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUeDLVWl9u0NP24RCPHg-Bw	0

Fact is, we are in a slight warming period, in a much larger cooling period. Climate will always change. But one isn't being given that basis to work from. For example.. which would be better for the human race... warmer or cooler? Answer is warmer, for more food and less distances need to migrate in INEVITABLE CLIMATE CHANGE. 'Cooling cycle' means less food and much larger distances needed in migration patterns= everyone must move towards the equator and leaving a significant area of occupied land spaces as of now. Once one puts that data into the discussion, 'Global Warming' suddenly becomes a moot point... unless of course one wants a mile high glacier sitting atop your home.

This reintroduction of co2 is what is causing the climate to speed up in its cycles in times where co2 were previously much higher hundreds of thousands of years ago. Our current bio system simply is not calibrated to the new environment and thus it causes the large imbalances and the chain reaction of events due to the change is what causes extinctions of species.

This is the basis Dems operate at.... cannot get what you want past the voter, go to the courts, where INTERPRETATION can avoid what the citizens want. Dems have been doing this endlessly, 'shopping Judges' and now want to install all Judges... even SOROS is getting locale Judges and prosecutors elected...as is shown in 2nd Amendment influence where a person can own a gun, but is guilty using a gun, per 2nd amendment rights to self protection. Easily evidenced recently. You have 2nd rights, but using them gets you arrested. Also easily evidenced it is political as 90% of gun violence is done by criminals... but enforcement upgrades doesn't affect criminals... only the non criminal..... getting around the constitution is well under way.

Article 3 of the constitution, and all the literature surrounding it makes it abundantly clear that the judiciary is intentionally an apolitical branch. To your point of this being a “job interview” your right, but imagine interviewing for a position that by creation is INTENTIONALLY APOLITICAL, but for some reason it appears that your interviewer doesn’t even understand the role of the position and continues to ask you POLITICAL questions that conflict with the very nature of the position..... that is what we’re witnessing here.
