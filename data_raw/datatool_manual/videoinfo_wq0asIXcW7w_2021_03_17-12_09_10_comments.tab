Hard surfaces like concrete and asphalt absorb more heat, that which isn't absorbed is reflected back at you. Plus no shade. The shade of the Rainforest canopy as well as the wetness absorbed by plants and transpired outwards will keep the air 1-2 degrees cooler, I'd say. Still, I wouldn't want the critters...

If I was living in a tropical climate I would ideally want to live in the rainforest under the canopy. City living in a tropical climate is so exposed. I lived in Cairns for a while and it was really hot in the city, but in the rainforest it feels better. No electricity in the rainforest though lol. I think the flora of the rainforest somehow regulates the heat and humidity in a way that makes it more natural for living primates.

The Canaries in the Atlantic (often seen as cousins to Hawai'i so alike are they), also sport many microclimates.

Yes, it's true that most parts of the Tropical Rainforest zones experience slightly less rain at some point in the year as a result of the shift in trade winds. In Monsoon/Savannah areas, this effect is obviously a lot more severe, but those areas are dealt with in Episode 2.

Yes, I plan to do a comparison of Koppen with the other climate classifications in a future video. But Koppen is by far the dominant one, which is why I did so many videos on it.

In the case of the SE tip of Florida (Palm Beach, Miami, etc.) - these are Am, not Af. One look at the rainfall graphs in this region will reveal a clear distinction in rainfall amounts between one part of the year and another (e.g. http://www.usa.com/palm-beach-county-fl-weather.htm - which also indicates December as 2.2 inches) Compare your area with, say, Iquitos in Peru, or Singapore - and you'll see the clear difference.

Initially, I thought I lived in a tropical monsoon climate. The rain patterns are spot on as you describe (very noticeable alternating wet and dry seasons), so the description just made sense. Upon further research, however, I read that the criteria for Af is that at least 2.4 inches (60mm) of rain falls every month. My town's driest month is typically February, which averages 2.5 inches of rain; this puts my town barely over the minimum. Furthermore, I've read the climate here described as a "trade wind tropical rainforest climate," which can allow Af to exist abnormally distant from the equator; you described a similar phenomenon appearing in Hawaii. The climate does seem rather varied upon the season for your description of Af, however. I'd be curious if you could clear up this confusion for me. Once again, thank you so much for the greatly informative series!	UCBHKsS3kEqpln7JYxzLN-kQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBHKsS3kEqpln7JYxzLN-kQ	1	UgxymZJuBXk0un1wvL94AaABAg	juno 660

Having been born in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), I always wondered, as a child and as a teen, what that &#39;winter&#39; from american TV felt like. We don&#39;t get to experience different seasons in there. It&#39;s mainly Summer or Brutally Hot Summer throughout all year. Having experienced temperatures as high as 43C and year round stickiness, since air is REALLY humid, well, I never really liked the climate myself. As a young adult I then moved to Florian√≥polis (Brazil), a city much more to the south of the country. Being for the first time in a Subtropical climate, I got to experience actual winters (lowest temp there is around 6C, doesn&#39;t actually snow), even though it&#39;s an island. I now love and surround myself with tropical plants in the apartment, building my private urban jungle, but can&#39;t withstand the actual climate they thrive on haha. I visit Rio de Janeiro several times every year and it&#39;s always one of both: scorchingly sunny or heavily rainy, and always hot, be it day or night.

Thanks once again for take your time and effort for do such an invaluable work for people whom love the earth, the climate and nature. I live in the Dominican Republic and you mentioned it, and as I saw you included some videos of my country. We here in the torric zone lie into the Af, Am, Aw, and Cwb, Cfb.... the Dominican Republic has the most variety of climates and landscapes in the Caribbean due to the mountains we haved that reaches over 3,000 meters above the sea level.

It always fascinates me how local topography can influence human settlement. As you indicate, there are no sheltered valleys of any size in the DR - compared with those giant valleys in Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia that have supported great cities for centuries.

I will try to investigate, but I really think that one possible reason is that we don't have greats plateaux in our highlands to support a big city, just valleys. Meanwhile... stay dry!!

I would be interested to find out if there is an historical reason why the population centres in the DR did not go into the highlands like most others in Latin America. Perhaps, being a smaller island, it made more sense to stay on the coast by the ports...

I hope you get to visit one day... It's interesting that people don't live in the highlands where you are - this is the opposite of Colombia and Ecuador, where most of the population centres are in the mountains to escape the heat and (in past times) tropical diseases...

I'm glad this series has brought some joy and enlightenment ;) Yes, I did feature the Dominican Republic in the episodes on Af (and I think Am/Aw), but I have never been to your country. However, in my research I have looked at a detailed map of the climate zones there before (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_of_the_Dominican_Republic#/media/File:Dominican_Republic_K%C3%B6ppen.svg) and it always amazes me how much variation you can have in one relatively small place due to topography (mountains).

There is a sliver of tropical climate in Far North Queensland called the Wet Tropics, and just south of Cairns around Innisfail some say is Af climate. However other sources say it&#39;s not true tropical climate, but is seasonal Am tropical climate. Do you know if indeed that little region is Af?<br /><br />Also, is the Daintree rainforest Af or Am, which is the tropical rainforest just north of Cairns?<br /><br />Great videos by the way.

I'd thought I'd just report back as I've found what I was after. I've been doing my research and the guessing is over. I found numerous articles dealing with the issue and there is consensus on which is the richest tropical rainforest in the world. The results weren't what I had guessed. To get the big question out of the way, the tropical rainforest with the greatest biodiversity in the world per acre or whatever, is actually Borneo. The Bornean lowland tropical rainforests, in particular up north Borneo. Get this, Borneo by itself has more species than the whole continent of Africa. Ok, the least rich tropical rainforest of the three biggies is African. Main reason is it's drier and generally a lot more seasonal, due apparently to a couple of factors and influences. Second richest rainforest behind Borneo is the rainforests of the Malayan pennisular. Third richest is thought to possibly be the Amazon rainforest in Columbia. The first two are definites, the third one is a maybe. In any event the Columbian one is right up there. Northern Amazon has more rich rainforest than south Amazon. West-central African tropical rainforest is richer than East African. Another interesting fact is that traditionally it was thought that there were more species in South American tropical rainforests than in those of Asia due to South American rainforests being so big an area even though not as rich, however it's now been found that they're about even in the number of species overall. So no, South American rainforests don't have more species, it's equal first with the Asian ones, even though the Asian ones have signficantly less area. This is newer findings and the general population hasn't caught up with it yet. It's a testimant to how rich the Asian tropical rainforests are, particularly those of Melasia (West Indonesia plus Malayan pennisular tropical rainforests). One of the main reasons the Bornean rainforests are the most biodiverse is because they have such stable tropical climate. There were a couple of other contributing reasons as well, but the climate thing is the biggy apparently. Interesting fact, the Bornean rainforests have the tallest tropical trees, you know, higher emergents, higher canopy. The tallest tropical tree in the world is just over 100 metres located in Far North Borneo. That particular area where the tallest tropical tree are has a crazy amount of tree species, the most tree species in the world per area.

Anyway you might remember me asking whether the Daintree tropical rainforest just north of Cairns was Af or Am. Well I was just reading on tropical rainforests and by accident discovered that wikipedia says the Daintree Rainforest is in fact Seasonal Tropical Rainforest. As you may know, the Daintree Rainforest is the oldest tropical rainforest in the world, but unfortunately not Af. I think you saw that fact in the rainfall figures on Cairns.

Nonetheless you've given me a lot of food for thought. Complex factors become more important to biodiversity above 2000mm rainfall, that is interesting. I bet the isolated exposed islands of South East Asia vs the sheltered continental rainforests of Amazon and Congos has some sort of bearing for or against greater biodiversity. That characteristic would be something to look into. I suppose the sea salt breeze might make for a drier rainforest than the sheltered rainforest that swelters in the middle of a continent. Well just a guess. From what I understand there are tropical rainforests on the coast although it doesn't hold as easily as inland. That might encourage a more hardcore rainforest in the Amazon and Congo regions. The rivers in the Amazons are very large compared to South East Asia, seems to collect and retain H2O a lot better. Just based on this logic, on the island vs continental aspect I'm guessing towards the more sheltered continental rainforests being more hardcore biodiverse rainforests. A humid oven is what the tropics thrives on which I suppose is why most rainforest thrives inland away from the coast. Look at the Amazon and Congo rainforests, it congregates way inland. Complex topic indeed!	UC_uvolCUgNAmRlKmak3etGw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_uvolCUgNAmRlKmak3etGw	1	UgxIjVmYklaI9iPbUlF4AaABAg	Alan Taylor
UgxIjVmYklaI9iPbUlF4AaABAg.8z6hy8FQEge8zheUY2bgAq		1	2019-09-10 16:04:11	GeoDiode	@Alan Taylor I simply don't have that level of specialist knowledge to comment, since this is moving out of climatology and into botany and zoology. One thing I can say, though, is that once the rainfall is above a certain amount (like 2000mm annually) *and* has no noticeable dry season, then it really doesn't matter how much more rain falls. The biodiversity will depend on *highly* complex factors, such as geology (richness of soils), isolation of islands (e.g. Indonesia) vs continental areas (Congo, Amazon), and also random things like avian migration routes (think Costa Rica - more bird species than the rest of N.America). It's a very complex topic - I'll do my best to cover it in the next episode of "Biomes" - which I should have done by the end of Sept.

UgxIjVmYklaI9iPbUlF4AaABAg.8z6hy8FQEge8zZ3WShCRuT		0	2019-09-06 22:39:13	Alan Taylor	Oh, have you got any thoughts on which of the three major Af zones (1. Borneo/South-East Asia, 2. Amazon, 3. Congo) is the most biodiverse/deeply tropical? What I mean by "deeply tropical" is which of the three regions is generally the furthest on the Af spectrum. They all contain Af climate, but there would also have to be a spectrum within the Af climate. If you're not sure off the top of your head, would you know how I could go about finding out? I've done searches on it but have come up with conflicting conclusions. Are the highest rainfall figures the primary factor for determining which region is the furthest on the tropical spectrum, or can you get more biodiverse areas that have less rainfall? I have looked at that a bit and I think the Amazon contains the highest rainfall figures out of the three tropical rainforest regions, and the Congo the least. Although another source said Borneo had the most biodiversity. So it's hard to get a straight answer. I don't know if it's always the case, but my understanding of the definition of "biodiverse" is how many species of flora and fauna are within a given acre of rainforest. And that the more biodiverse the rainforest is, the further on the tropical spectrum it is. I hope I've communicated what I'm trying to say good enough for you to understand where I'm coming from and what I'm asking, I'm not exactly a climatology major and I'm sure a climatology specialist would communicate the question a lot better using specialist terminology XD	UC_uvolCUgNAmRlKmak3etGw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_uvolCUgNAmRlKmak3etGw	1	UgxIjVmYklaI9iPbUlF4AaABAg	Alan Taylor

Try the temp and rainfall graphs for Babinda, which is definitely within that sliver. Also could you link that updated 2018 map?

It shows most of Northern Australia as Aw, but there is a tiny sliver of Af on the QLD coast right by Cairns, which is odd, because looking at Cairns' temp and rainfall graphs, it's definitely Am. Oh well...	UC1raaXFgsFBSFR8qNgchF2g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1raaXFgsFBSFR8qNgchF2g	1	UgxIjVmYklaI9iPbUlF4AaABAg	Alan Taylor
UgxIjVmYklaI9iPbUlF4AaABAg.8z6hy8FQEge8z6juQN31-_		1	2019-08-26 22:40:24	Alan Taylor	Another thing I've been wondering for a while, is which of the big three (Amazon, Congo, Borneo) Af tropical rainforests is the most deeply tropical, bio-diverse Af climate? If you go off which gets the most rain, if I'm not mistaken, the Amazon seems to have better rain figures than the other two, especially the region to the west of the Andes in Columbia. And the Amazon seems to have bigger rivers which might also be an indication of more rain. Although if looking at bio-diversity according to range of evolution, the Amazon doesn't have primates as intelligent as the Congo. Congo has chimpanzees which are the most intelligent species. In terms of which rainforest is the most bio-diverse with the most number of species of flora and fauna in a given acre of rainforest, some sources I've searched on say it's Borneo, then others say it's the Congo, while others say it's the Amazon!

These are in the western fringes of the Oceanic climate zone - specifically the Olympic Peninsula in Washington State, USA, and the "Wet Coast" of South Island New Zealand.

UgyMmu8zxz5Dj_BRGw14AaABAg	1	0	2020-09-27 02:43:04	Lucas Garecht	At what elevation is a rain forest no longer possible? As altitude increases, temperature decreases, which is of course necessary for a lush, verdant tropical rainforest. The Wikipedia article only goes so far as to say &quot;Tropical climates are characterized by constant high temperatures (at sea level and low elevations);&quot; but doesn&#39;t mention the range at which a rainforest is possible. <br /><br />Can anyone shed some light on this?

As elevation increases, the tropical rainforest morphs into "Cloud Forest" (most notable example is in Ecuador), before developing into a unique form of evergreen temperate forest (see my episode on Subtropical Highlands for this type of climate). So it's a gradual process - there isn't any sudden change.	UC1raaXFgsFBSFR8qNgchF2g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1raaXFgsFBSFR8qNgchF2g	1	UgyMmu8zxz5Dj_BRGw14AaABAg	Lucas Garecht
