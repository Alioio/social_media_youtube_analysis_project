The government haven't done anything to upgrade the grid so it can handle all the power that's coming from solar, wind and water power. South Australia has a battery farm that was installed by Musk but we need more of these and a better way to transport that increased power load. But no, this government would rather just build more coal mines and export more coal. Lazy, unimaginative and a bunch of Luddites.

If China and India do not curb their CO2 then everyone else is wasting their time. And that assuming CO2 is the reason for the sight temperature increase. Is pretty obvious why people in general are sceptical of CO2 reduction efforts. Keep cutting down the trees, building cities, roads and having tons of babies, as long as CO2 remains below 400ppm everything else will be just fine! CO2 is just a distraction, the real problem is 7.8 billion and rising !	UCMg0ndDO4Q2hYddJX6PsF4Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMg0ndDO4Q2hYddJX6PsF4Q	1	Ugw0mjGabs5qNoOZQF54AaABAg	Christine Herson

The science behind it is very simple: - burning fossil fuels necesarily releases CO2 - CO2 is a greenhouse gas (it traps heat) - CO2 levels in the atmosphere have been rising over the last century, and the magnitude of this increase is consistent with the amount of fossil fuel we have burnt. - temperatures have been increasing over the last century and this increase is consistent with the increase in levels of CO2 in the atmosphere.
