The problem with plastic bags and straws and just plastic in general, is not the CO2 emissions, but the negative impact of plastic in the environment.

This will mean fossil fuels remain financially sustainable for longer, and may allow companies to squeeze a few more decades of profit out of oil exploration while suppressing advancements towards clean energy through market competition. It's a stop gap measure - the oil industry still won't last forever and government regulation may intervene (big maybe) - but we may not have a few extra decades to lose here.

It really isn't within my professional capacity to really make an argument on that further. However biodegradable plastics are being developed but the customers we have choose not to use them and go for non biodegradable plastics instead due to cost concerns, making your steak cost 2$ instead of 1$ due to using the more expensive biodegradable plastics instead of conventional packaging material.

There are cases where plastic usage is necessary, in logistics(light and strong and durable so better for palettes then wood, plus packaging materials in some cases) and medicine(disposables) are what comes to mind. But please for the love of god stop using those cheap LDPE plastic bags and switch to PET Recycled fabric bags, they're reuseable and the fabric is made of PET recycled from old bottles and such. Oh and fuck those people in particular that buy things in thousands of layers of plastic bags.

If you were to undertake the classic path of Bachalor's -> Master's -> Ph. D. and then got employed fresh out of your Ph. D. programme (although it's usually better to do some postdocs (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postdoctoral_researcher) before doing that), you could be permanently employed at the age of 27-32 (with the average somewhere around 29). However, the whole point of Ph. D. is learning how to properly do research (reducing the number to about 25), and the final year of your Master's is also spent doing research, although it's usually under guidance from some advisor, so the final answer could be 24. That being said, most countries offer some option for high school students to have an internship at some research institute, so I would advise you to look for something like that, as you could get a sense of what does it take to be a researcher and test whether it's right for you :) If you have any more questions, definitely ask away :D	UC2exk5uWPUnGBgxuAbnHMBw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2exk5uWPUnGBgxuAbnHMBw	1	Ugw60IpL4O6tjAlFUyd4AaABAg	Proactrinium Pn

That said is it so unreasonable to think that we can maybe shrug off climate change? If being responsible with ecosystem is the risk free adult strategy, the one I&#39;m about to mention is the high risk high reward sacrifice all your pieces and checkmate approach. Now there is no current technology for this. But if we&#39;re to say become digital versions of ourselves we&#39;d no longer need the ecosystem. We no longer need the grain, we eat the sun. If we could achieve this in 50 years it&#39;s checkmate. I&#39;m not qualifed to make or know this but maybe people in charge know. They know it&#39;s coming so they don&#39;t mind climate change. Btw I don&#39;t necessarily believe this just a thought I found interesting.	UCWCWuVZsJFSkEruMfm6Mqfw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWCWuVZsJFSkEruMfm6Mqfw	0

Your question assumes matrix like world where real life problems are overlooked. Kinda like what's depicted in ready player one. What I think is more likely is we dealing with the symptoms as things get worse. There is a kurzgesagt video about a technology we can use to block out sun rays, that kinda stuff. Well be like that customer who's always behind payments but makes sure his assets doesn't get seized. Of course we'll let it get pretty bad before coming up with an action plan. I expect meat and coffee to get a lot more expensive, desperate struggle over water in some regions and largest refugee crisis we'll ever face. If possible I would like to avoid anything of this sort. But also I know many people need to see these kinda things in order to stop being an obstacle. I'm also interested in the after period of all this. Problems we're having with the ecosystem is going to motivate us to exist outside of it. Climate change can be the catalyst for a serious transhumanist push. If I live to see that I'd feel it was all worth it. So in a way I can say I'm kinda worried about climate change but also I'm worried about stagnation of technological progress because I hope to live long enough to that certain point.

It doesn&#39;t compare individuals to corporations - it counts all emissions as caused by the company that produced the fossil fuels, even if they are burned by consumers, eg to power a car. It compares corporations to other corporations and finds that the fossil fuel industry (agriculture having been excluded from the calculations) is monopolised, which is still useful information.

For the record most plastic pollution comes from China, India, Pakistan, and Myanmar. Those plastic straws have hardly any impact on their own. But plastic when expanded to sun and salt water it breaks down and it breaks apart into various hydrocarbons many these can be cancerous, function as hormones, or straight up be toxic. These can affect the plankton that live in water, which produce the majority of earth's oxygen, more than all terrestrial plant life in fact. So even if you reduce your carbon emissions, you end up destroying a majority of the carbon cycle and oceanic life.

And let capitalism and demand do their thing, see what is happening with tesla and elon musks different kinds of transportation systems. Entrepreneurs are the ones who fix problems, not governments.

The best point you made is that corporations cause the problem and that people should rally corporations to change. He‚Äôs right. People lobbying to create cleaner corporations and knew corporations that are clean is FUCKING market fixing climate change. He makes a point about how the market/people help climate change then bashes NeOlIbErAlIsM. I think climate change is a bigger issues than Ben thinks but he‚Äôs a great guy in general.
