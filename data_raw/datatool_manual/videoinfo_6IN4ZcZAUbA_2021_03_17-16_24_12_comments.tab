But great journalism is expensive and ads alone aren’t enough to support it. If you are in a position to do so, please join a community of nearly 20,000 people who believe in the public value of information, and support Vox with a financial contribution. It’s a great way to help keep our journalism, including the video explainers you love, free for all. <a href="http://www.vox.com/contribute">http://www.vox.com/contribute</a>	UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA	0

However, this is a global phenomenon in the agricultural sector. The logical thing is that due to overpopulation and the great demand for food, farmers should have a good income. However, the reality is very different: farmers around the world lose money no matter what they produce. What a model disaster.

The peasants of that area have planted coffee for generations and moving the crops higher is not possible in a short period of time, the peasants of higher areas do not have the knowledge and the fundamental thing is that there is no economic incentive to do it for the low prices.

To grow anything there must be adequate temperatures and adequate soil and certain characteristics, a soil can be used for one thing, but not for another. In other words, Everest can thaw, but you cannot plant the same things on top of Everet as in an area at sea level. In addition, that area of Colombia is specialized in producing coffee, in colder climates at higher elevations the farmers specialize in other things such as planting potatoes and other cold climate products.

Colombia is a mountainous country and the higher the altitude, the colder it is and the lower the heat. That is why in Colombia there are intermediate areas where coffee has been planted in a traditional way. However, global warming has caused many areas that had the right temperatures to heat up, damaging crops.

Climate change is real for starters and is effecting all us even if it's not in the media. Second yes you can build a big greenhouse but nature gave us hundreds of kilometers to grow crops on with very little economic cost. If we had to replace outdoor crops with greenhouses that would be devastating to the climate and also cost a lot of money to do. That is like saying why is there world hunger if people in the desert can build a greenhouse and reverse osmosis water from the sea...it costs too much and is impractical. What is practical is reducing climate change and supporting the people and communities that are effected.

This is the reason why CBDa & Caffeine infused together make a great combination for promoting alertness, focus, energy & productivity without the side-effects like the jitters or caffeine sensitivity.

Also, I said coca leaves are what are used in coca cola and they are not intoxicating. The coca leaf is healthy for you. Think of it like this: wine is intoxicating. It can be made out of grapes, but do we consider grapes to be intoxicating? NO. It's the same with the coca leaves. They are continuously dipped in toxic chemicals to create cocaine. This does not mean that the coca leaf is cocaine. Again, I repeat, it is not bad but healthy to chew. It has been around and been chewed by people long before the Aztec Empire.

If it's administered in the right way, it could make sick patients quality of life so much better. But the government and big pharma isn't interested in the people's quality of life. We're all just cash cows for them. Finally people are just coming around to marijuana. Marijuana should have never ever been restricted.

These leaves have no intoxicating qualities whatsoever. It's actually one of the healthiest plants you can chew. Tired coal miners in South America chew it for energy during the job. Also, it's not very profitable because the U.S. has wrongfully deemed it illegal around the world while allowing it's use in coca cola.😒	UC48HFGx8Cyg8tyIH__gwleg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC48HFGx8Cyg8tyIH__gwleg	1	Ugy4zUL6jHPL_7a3TUB4AaABAg	deepak

Because there are countries which claim to be producers even though they do not own the deposits, mines or plantations, such as Rwanda which loots diamonds and coltan from the Congo when it has no deposit on its territory. Still others claim to produce more tonnes than the country actually owns, suggesting that they are getting supplied elsewhere. Please tell us exactly WHO IS REALLY PRODUCING WHAT AND IN WHAT QUANTITY. Let us finally know from which country which raw materials are drawn.

But with light roasts those super bitter compounds are not there, so super hot water will only extract more flavor and it will all be good	UC6KIAK4PlqfKFBbgs9uv44w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6KIAK4PlqfKFBbgs9uv44w	1	Ugz_RSSluXN4zTsztGt4AaABAg	Ben Hadfield

Having said that, I read that the water needs to be at a certain temperature (not more than 190F, I think?) to get the best flavor extraction. If the water's too hot, I think it gets bitter again.

Starbucks really... associates super hot with good coffee. Which it isn't, because that burns the coffee. Worsening its taste. Meaning while it can taste good, you're not really getting the best out of the beans. It's like burning a pizza, sure it can still taste good. But its a burnt pizza. It could be so much better.

People have A LOT of power, if they can organize a unified stance, en masse, and speak with their dollars, or by boycotting certain products. The problem is that we can't agree, or organize, because nobody can be bothered. And change isn't easy. Wanting change is easy, we all want change. Few of us actually have the grit to carry it out.

You may not like their coffee but if you do your research you will see they do a lot for their origin farmers. They pay top dollar for the beans and invest in infrastructure such as building medical facilities, schools, etc. They realize if they take great care of their farmers they will be able to keep growing the best coffee in the world. Unfortunately even Starbucks cannot control the weather manipulation that is going on! Their Espresso roast is made with Arabica as well.

If you want to try a good robusta, I invite you to taste some Vietnamese coffee, like Trung Nguyen for starter, you'll be astonished. The bad reputation of robusta is due to big groups that intensively produce it and roast it industrially in order to reduce the cost further while making more profit. Because if you see the evolution of coffee price in your retail store and the evolution of coffee price to the coffee farm, you'll see a nice inverse correlation where the price paid to the coffee farmer is going down, while what you pay is going up.

Vox is telling you only one side of the story, unlike these farmers many have already anticipated rise in temperature ( I am not gonna call it climate change/global warming) and are coming up with the solution. I believe many of you have worked in some sort of corporation, so you must know that market is never steady it's always fluctuating. When they made tonnes of money, they should have planned for the adverse times.

Depending on the origin you're looking for it's typically around 3-4 USD a lb, for common stuff but it's going up because of covid impacting farmers ability to harvest. It's already jumped 20% since spring and only going to get worse. I also don't see 16kg bags very often, they're typically 40. And while not looking to defend Starbucks or Tim Hortons or any of their ilk it's a raw product that needs processing. Pircing in spices aren't much different I don't think.

According to the Specialty Coffee Association, specialty coffee certified beans sell raw for $2.25-2.75 per pound; $85-90 per bag.

The video does say farmers have several ways to overcome climate change, but they increase cost. The root cause is the breakup of international coffee agreement and then coffee price dropped so that farmer cannot even meet balance.

However, the one today is not. Natural factors would be leading us gradually into an ice age over millennia. However, the earths temperature is going up at an unnatural rate. You can check the carbon records of the earth if you go to Antarctica where they log carbon in ice, and compare to current levels - natural causes alone could not make the temperature shoot up in such a small time period. It is clear that more carbon and greenhouse gases are in the atmosphere - it's not hard to check with equipment detecting radioactivity and half life of carbon 14/13. No matter the cause, it is happening, the effects are being felt, climate refugees are coming from islands and the equator, the marshal islands may not exist soon - no matter the cause, something must be done about it. Check IPCC panels and other records - this is also well explained by someones video "WHY Climate change is a nightmare". But of course, if you're not going to trust anything (other than the fossil-fuel bought off governmnt) you won't be persuaded.

I compared rates of glacial growth/retreat pre industrial times to modern times. Summed up, yes, the climate is dynamic because of Milankovitch cycles but that is on the order of many thousands of years. The rate of change we see today can't be explained by Milankovitch cycles or changes in solar intensity, or volcanic activity for that matter.

It is inevitable in the long-term, but we have been speeding up the process immensely, and we can in fact do something about that. Not to mention the climate both warms and cools, and at this point in our cycle we should be at a plateau and start to cool. Instead we're warming more rapidly than the climate has waned in 800,000 years. Sorry, but we can't sit back and pretend we have no control over it. Stop mass producing cars and meat products and see what happens. We have influence over even the climate now.

However, the rise in temperature in past century has increased at the rate where the rise in 12 degrees in global temperature is supposed to be through half a million years, the rise in temeprature would also cause the change in biodiversity of our planet due to variation of temperatures but it is not as postive, increased tempature may then allow now colder areas to grow the foods that we now grow in warmer climates, However, the increased in temperature globally would in the Long run affect how winds travel globally, the difference in how wind travel would then result in a change in the rate of rainfall of different areas as the winds carries moisture when travelling over water bodies, this would affect agriculture,trade routes and livability of locations, cities such as New York will sink due to increased sea levels of the world due to melting glaciers and ice caps. The climate change is inevitable,but the problem lies on which we're changingiy too fast.

Humans after the industrial revolution have been a major contributor in increasing the rate at which temperatures change. Like many things, the climate exists in an equilibrium and if we disturb it, it has effects like severe weather conditions. You want data, see how many natural forest fires there were 50 years ago vs now. 'Incomplete knowledge is a dangerous thing' and you are a shining example of the same.

Because there’s no price minimum, they always buy at market price which is always fluctuating and often dips below what is needed for farmers to make a good income.

I also don’t disagree with what you’re saying, for the most part. I appreciate coffee outside of Starbucks and large corporations who are buying up cheap coffee that has flooded the markets from Southeast Asia. I personally have made a consumer choice to not purchase coffee unless it’s from a roaster who works with farmers to ensure they are getting fair compensation for their labor. That’s a consumer choice though, and I understand that that is a choice that most people who consume coffee are not willing to make, even if they spend more overtime buying Starbucks rather than purchasing coffee for home brew. I appreciate your assessment, but I still believe coffee should have a minimum price as it once did.

UgxPOMH3yWxuQaeOtFZ4AaABAg.9Cx0pp9AIll9DBmifuMPFv		15	2020-09-04 17:32:07	Hernando Malinche	Connor Zielinski A price minimum would make coffee more expensive and people would buy less coffee. Subsidizing an industry doesn’t work, India has tried that by subsidizing its farmers and it had a disastrous effect where farmers had more money but the price of everything went up. Remember subsidies doesn’t increase production, so the actual amount of good and services will still be the same. If the market is saying coffee prices are too low then that means there’s too much coffee on the market so farmers should switch to something else. That is how we, a capitalistic society deal with supply and demand. This is how capitalist stays efficient. If something is needed more then it will be valued at a higher price. Coffee is not needed.

It still blows my mind this can happen so seamlessly that you don't even think where it comes from. Growing is hard, I come from a background of farmers...but there are a lot of other people who work to bring everyday people their coffee as well.

In fact, this is the case for most products we buy. For example, 3 grams of lipstick might cost 2$ to produce, but packaging it, shipping it, advertising it and selling it in stores costs a lot of money. That tube of $2 lipstick might end up costing $20 by the time it reaches your hands. Don't get me wrong, there are definetely a lot of companies who price gauge a ridiculous and unnecessary amount, but it is important to remember that some of that price gauging is necessary to pay all the people who got that coffee all the way from Columbia to your local grocery store or coffee shop.

Ugz2GMYkVHIkQ50CHIR4AaABAg	35	1098	2020-08-13 07:43:06	Juan Herrera-zapata	I am a very proud descendant of Colombian coffee farmers, and I wanna tell you that during the last two years I have been studying in the USA, I never bought coffee at one of the big chains. And, I am so radical, simply because I am well aware of the way these big companies use their power to fix prices and squeeze small farmers like the ones you saw on the video. The coffee value chain is more than a simple industry. It is a way of life and the culture for thousands of people in Colombia, and other amazing countries with strong and resilient people. <br /><br />When most coffee drinkers buy their coffee, they never realize where the beans come from... Simple things like this help dignify the farmer&#39;s work, at the time it helps you realize that coffee is not a dark drink that comes out of a coffee machine, you will appreciate more if you stop for a while and think about the great product you are drinking. Try to support your local coffee roaster. if you can, buy beans you know are purchase with fair prices... grind them weekly and brew your coffee every day. <br /><br />And thank you to VOX for creating such an amazing video.

I agree with you about good coffee however, for home I purchase quality beans, I grind them with a small hand grinder every time I want to make a coffee, then pour over. When outside of home, I pay $4.00 - 5.00 for good quality coffee (no big brands garbage, thank you very much), I don't mind paying this price because the flavour is worth it, but these good coffees are not easy to find even in a large city like Toronto, Ontario, Canada. I drive all over the region of the city of Toronto most every day for work, and finding quality coffee is always a challenge.

I thought it was an accident the first time. Apparently, they want everyone to believe ITS YOUR FAULT AND YOUR KIDS 100%. They intend to create psychological harm to children. I've spoken to children with this "it's my fault the world is ending" complex. Makes me sick regarding companies like Vox that push that "lie by omission" agenda. This is my deleted comment: "Just had to throw in "as man-made climate change warms the planet, it's shrinking" right in the very beginning? Ice caps have been melting for over 11,700 years (after the 2.6 million year Pleistocene Epoch "ice age"). It is apparent that we're still coming down from the last ice age, but one sure way to SPLIT the care of climate change is to put 100% of the blame on humans. I wish someone would've prevented cave men with their HORRIBLE discovery of fire, they've been melting our planet ever since. Cave women too. Climate change IS REAL, but placing the blame entirely or even in most part on humans starts the conversation outside of current scientific reality. Great video, other than making it a partisan issue from the outset. " I'm assuming they don't monitor replies? We'll see. lol Respect for Vox -1,000 pts.

Tons still bring up predictions of global cooling from decades ago, tons insist it's some sort of conspiracy the libs will use to take over the world. Secondly, go back 10-15 years and the people who now say "well of course it's warming, the question is why" were saying "it isn't real." As things continue to get worse and it becomes more and more obvious that we caused this, the new line will be "Actually THOSE people did it" or "It was inevitable and nothing could have been done." The deniers will never be proven wrong, they'll just move on to the next lie.

Starbucks had to assure that they use only Fair-Trade Colombian Coffee if they wanted to open a store. Starbucks surely grew a lot in Colombia, but the Coffee-growers federation owned brand Juan Valdéz and other local brands still dominate the market thanks to conscious consumers. This is how the free competition in the market somehow (even if there are still important issues to be solved) worked well.

An archeologist went to Syria and saw carvings of mermaids and people bowing down to her and a man being thrown up out of a big fish mouth. The Bible talks about Jonah being swallowed by a fish. When Jonah arrived to Niniveh I’m pretty sure when the people saw Jonah coming out of the fish it was easier for them to believe Gods message. The Bible also talks about a fish gate area Zephaniah 1:10 I always wonder if they did human sacrifices by the mermaid statues and that’s why I decided years ago not to buy anything from Starbucks anymore unless they take off the mermaid logo	UCkWx-oQvph2cUd2MMhRDpkA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkWx-oQvph2cUd2MMhRDpkA	1	UgzEUCwOZ-K6dGnyzxR4AaABAg	chding zuure

You get what the state thinks is fair pay for your labor and you'll like it or else. Pay is fixed but the quotas expected are dictated by the state. It's also where the state owns EVERYTHING. None of these small owners would own anything. They would be managers for a plot of land owned by the state and paid by the state. They would not even be allowed any of the coffee they create unless they use their voucher/point/ticket allotment as all others would have. Remember, socialism is the small version of communism. Communism is what happens when the "means of production" are too large for small committee planning and have to be bumped up to national levels. Don't confuse welfare (most of Europe & Scandinavian countries) with socialism.

But the wealthy who hold the most of the money and in affect the power in the world. For example conglomerates and or corporations use their wealth and resources to influence politicians(lobbying) to enact change in legislation that benefits the wealthy to keep them in positions of power and control. The capitalist system is rigged. It's very susceptible to corruption. Hence why we're seeing things like the climate crisis and it's affects being ignored. Those in power are often old, and will be gone way before they have to face the real consequences. Some of the wealthy have invested money in fleeing the planet and creating utopias for themselves on other planets.

You might be surprised to learn what your local farmers get paid for their produce. Even in first world countries like the USA animal products like milk and beef can have around half their price going to the farmer but for fruit and vegetables that drops down to around 20%, it's even lower for cereal based food. Some of that goes to transport, warehousing and packaging, but the lion's share is often the supermarket itself.

The only way to keep coffee for years without it degrading to the point where it’s no longer enjoyable is to freeze dry the newly roasted beans, vacuum pack them in a freezer-safe container, and put them in a freezer.

Cutting down mature trees and replacing them with faster growing and healthier trees may help with carbon sequestering and many industries but that comes at a cost to biodiversity. I don't have anything against commercial use of trees since I work in forest industry myself. It's just important to realise you also need to set aside large nature preserves which are actually natural. I live in northern europe and while about 78% of the area in my country is covered in forests it's pretty much all commercial forests. Only about 12% of forests is protected and that's mostly areas where trees don't grow well so those areas are not useful for forest industry. Essentially forest coverage has increased here but species are becoming endangered at ever faster rate. Still it's difficult to tell people "nope, you can't make money out of your property and should hand it over for conservation".

While climate change is a large factor to their problem, the bigger problem is economics. They simply have way too many people producing coffee beans. More beans = lower prices = less and less sustainable. Imagine the climate went back to say 50 years ago; these farmers will simply be producing even more beans and driving prices of beans even lower. Breaking up those large farms into smaller farms was a desperate move but not sustainable. The only way to to produce that much coffee beans and keep costs down is through economies of scale. This requires merging of those farms. But even this is not sustainable. The only solution is to cut production/farms or to somehow increase global consumption. Its rather simple economics. Too much supply, not enough demand. Subsidies are only bandages and don't fix the root problem. There is a similar problem in US' dairy industry and Canada's maple industry just as examples. Organizations try to monopolize those industries in order to set prices, but inevitably it is not a sustainable solution without pumping money into it to prop up these industries.

They are crossbreeding with the wild varieties and using gene splicing. They may be also doing things like splicing the roots of one cultivar with the top of another cultivar. This type of work is always being done to fight diseases with new ones always coming into existence, so temperature and precipitation are just another set of factors which have to be addressed. Climate change means we change the plant.	UCB5E7ccfa0uMW_EcU_PMh4g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB5E7ccfa0uMW_EcU_PMh4g	1	Ugz1b1-VP5LkCCX0S054AaABAg	Aaron Telander

One of the many gods in the mythology of ancient Greece, Pan was the god of shepherds and of woods and pastures. The Greeks believed that he often wandered peacefully through the woods, playing a pipe, but when accidentally awakened from his noontime nap he could give a great shout that would cause flocks to stampede. From this aspect of Pan's nature Greek authors derived the word panikos, “sudden fear,”.

It's a relatively sudden increase in global temperatures that can be tied directly to increases in human industrial activity dating back to the industrial revolution. Even if the rising temperature was normal, we're destroying the natural mechanisms that regulate it, like rain forest and the ozone. Not only are we adding fuel to the fire, we're destroying all the safe guards to keep that fire in check.

High sea temperatures is what storms need to become hurricanes. It seems to me that you have never experienced a hurricane before. When we say that hurricanes are getting stronger and more frequent thanks to the human we mean that our practices as a society that are leading to global warming is whats causing this.

Though yes the corruption of the government on the island is also at fault it wouldn't have been if america took more reigns in the situation. Instead of just sending money and letting the government of Puerto Rico manage it itslef. Since america did fight the Spaniards to take hold of the island for the agriculture and the tourrist capability of the island. The island has been on a decline pattern since the involment of the US and various hurricanes, with little support from the mainland. Having govenors from states like NY demanding that Puerto Rico gets the fund needed. And on top of that the majority of Peurto Ricans would want the island to become a state, in hopes that the US will finally handle the dire situation that there is on the island. And as for the involvment of the people in the government there isn't one. Since Puerto Rico is only a territory we don't have rights to vote or make any desicions that go on in the mainland. And as I've said before Puerto Rico is a place to make money for america, and to spread their power and influence to other countries. But for you to say that Puerto Ricans don't do anything but beg, and give nothing in return is absolutely disgusting. America took the island with or without the consent of the people living on the island, and forced to make this island a money machine when it was in its glory. And on top of that we aren't a state of the US it's more close to slavery than anything else.

I agree earth has been damaged but it's not because of CO2. Humans engaging in Afforestation on deserts and then deforestation of actual forests, creating artificial clouds, trying to control the weather, and then damaging the quality of water are some of the reasons for Climate change/depletion of flora and fauna. Then another reason is that solar activity has increased in the past 30 years, especially 2020, which has shortened the growing season. People should be talking about things like the above but nope, let's talk about CO2, something that is helping flora grow faster than before.

It's the individual's job to reduce their own carbon emissions, which could be as small as using train as opposed to your own car everyday, or walking. Reducing the amount of waste we throw away, the amount of electricity we waste and the amount of extra food we buy that we also waste. Opting for things other than plastic. If both the individual, and the higher power were to work together we'd be able to reduce it. But it's not possible because nobody wants it that way, and because most people rely on the government to figure out something instead of taking responsibility and actions for their own contribution.

Some place could have the right temperature sure, but to have the right attitude, long periods of rain then dry periods, plus people knowledgeable enough to grow and not to mention actually WANT to grow coffee. It's kinda a tough ask. Actually funny enough Cali does grow some coffee! But it's more of a experiment. Also remember they are making cents on the pound. The minimum wage in America is 7.50. the coffee is picked by hand on the side of steep mountains. What business is gonna invest in that?

If all GM cars suddenly vanished, you would be forced to decide if you wanted to save up for an Aston Martin or gamble on a new cheaper brand you never heard of before, all the while knowing that either one can experience the same fate as GM, except this is a decision you'll have to wrestle with on a weekly or monthly basis. That's the situation they're discussing in this video.	UCIVLSTepidiyw6zvAsVTHUA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIVLSTepidiyw6zvAsVTHUA	1	UgxHBdkHakEU8af6GY14AaABAg	brickman409

It's also affecting tea growing, as both require similar kinds of mountainous habitat and hand picking. Many Asian farmers grow both. (And in fact before the British Empire made big bucks off of tea, they were also all about coffee, and Sri Lanka being "a tea place" only happened after the coffee plantations there failed due to monocultures and blight, like the coffee rust in this video). The infographic about 2050 coffee cultivation showed the Asian coffee growing areas shrinking dramatically too. It's certainly not just that Colombia needs to find a new niche or anything.

Without an agreement the prices fluctuate. If you're going to blame some poor Asian farmers, you might as well blame the rich, importing countries too for not signing a new deal. He concentrated on Colombia because it is widely known for the high quality Arabica that is particularly sensitive to climate change, and also because coffee has been such a vital part of its economy. If Colombia is synonymous with coffee, to highlight a climate change induced coffee crisis you might as well focus on it.

I would say soil is the most important factor as the ideal soils are well-draining ones like volcanic red earth and deep sandy loam. These types of soil can only be found in areas as you see in the maps in the clip. I see in Vietnam, only certain areas can produce high-quality coffee even technically coffee can be grown on a lot of soils. I heard about growing coffee in a container so they can control the soil, light, and water also. That would be a solution for the arabica coffee segment in the future.

But one thing is that the title of "Global Coffee Crisis" and just the intro of the video seemed to imply that coffee will become impossible to get or become ridiculously expensive all over the world. After watching the video, it just seems to me like this coffee crisis is more Colombian than global in nature. When he mentioned the cheap Asian coffee, the question that popped in my mind was, "Will there no longer be a good place in the world to grow coffee, or is that place simply moving?". While that is a big factor in the situation that Colombia is facing and I'm sure there's global implications to that as well, I just wish he would have delved into that a bit more.

The 'artisan' coffee like cold brew are expensive because of the equipment thats involved. You need to imagine a coffee machine can cost north of 15k, theres also scales that can go up to 400 and grinders that are 6-7k each . And thats only very basic equipment all cafes should have. The best way is to buy from certified brands that have some proof of a fair trade agreement with their farmers.

The price has mostly gone up because of increasing overhead costs, as well as higher resource costs. The coffee industry (including its consumers) is becoming much more aware about how poorly coffee farmers are treated and paid, so there is a much higher emphasis on sourcing coffee better and actually paying farmers more. There is still a large improvement that can be done, but the higher price definitely isn’t paying the cafes more. Cafes are generally very low margin businesses that rely making lots and lots of sales in order to make profit; they aren’t really swimming in cash.

Are you discussing McDonalds or 7-11 coffee? Those are the worst for growers btw. Stores and retailers may be making a profit but the margins are very small. If you truly care about growers make sure to buy Fair Trade Certified coffee and other certifications that guarantee a minimum price for coffee farmers.

If the climate changes, we alter the plant.	UCB5E7ccfa0uMW_EcU_PMh4g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB5E7ccfa0uMW_EcU_PMh4g	1	UgwR1KIe5KgnY7jyjDd4AaABAg	Jrdn Nlsn

The video raised two points - that TNCs (such as Starbucks) can at least help to make coffee producing a viable livelihood again, which would be a) fair to producers, and b) mitigate the future difficulties that climate change is causing for producers. But, yes, you are right in saying that climate change is bad	UCQrf214puL1k0bF1tTt_3iw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQrf214puL1k0bF1tTt_3iw	1	UgxEvksCyhGV9W954it4AaABAg	skylineXpert

Sadly this is a problem that is already even worse than we have yet realized which makes this video feel more like crowing to me. I am certainly not opposed to raising awareness but we need solutions and in the short term that means needing to support these farmers with the knowledge and the financing to mitigate the problem, this can save their livelyhoods now and carry them through while the global problem of climate change is brought under control anything less is fiddling while Rome burns as these farmers can't survive the damage already done without urgent direct support. That is to say climate change is the cause here but this is an issue that cannot wait for the solution to climate change, the earth moves on time scales where a millennium is barely a second and can survive a long term solution individual humans do not and cannot without real practical solutions. We must help the people suffering from this right now, almost seems pointless whining over the long term issue without doing this from my perspective, sure humans going extinct may solve the problem but we should and must work towards a solution with minimum human suffering or what is the point. TLDR this is not about the planet it is about people and people need help now they can't wait for the timescales needed to fix the planet.

Based on what I saw in this video and what I know about growing marijuana, it appears that coffee is more difficult to grow and requires very specific climate conditions to grow well and produce a lot of coffee beans. Why don't coffee growers switch to growing marijuana on the pieces of land where coffee doesn't grow very well anymore because of climate change?

Oh but it's not so important to you personally so I guess it doesn't matter. Bottom line is this piece is about more than just coffee, climate change will affect the livelihoods of every person living on this planet, a video like this humanises that. For many climate change is still somewhat of an abstract concept, people need to see the reality for humans as well as the environment and animals.

There you can “airbnb” these haciendas for a couple of days, lear about the culture, enjoy the parades and carnivals, and visit El Parque del Cafe in Montenegro, Quindio. It’s a theme park where you can see the history of coffee in Colombia, while you have fun in rides and shows. It’s great for all ages and it’s a fun way to learn about colombian coffee	UCaCkiO5WXcSc0q99NbpzF4A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaCkiO5WXcSc0q99NbpzF4A	0

You can find coffee shops by the name Juan Valdez, that buy from colombian farmers, but then again it’s not the best way to support them. But if you go to La Zona Cafetera, you can buy coffee directly from the farmers at there very on stands in farmers markets known as “Galerías” or “Plazas de mercado”. These are the places where locals go to buy from the farmers a couple times a week when the farmers go to the nearby towns or cities to sell there produce. I suggest befriending a local so he or she can help you avoid getting the “tourist pricing”. Although if you are willing to pay more so you can help them out, go ahead.

Their heavy-handed means of roasting is the proof that they are purchasing poor quality beans. There is no reason why a multi-national corporation roasting on enormous volumes and requiring absolute consistency (no matter the crop or season) would be buying good quality beans only to roast the life out of them. Starbucks achieves a consistently drinkable coffee around the world but that's due to the processes in place in preparation. It is not an indication of quality beans.

The same Arabica beans can be roasted by your local amazing coffee shop and turn out completely different. I think the reason that they used Starbucks is because like it or not, they have done an excellent global marketing campaign. MANY people drink starbucks, and while you can judge them for that choice, you cannot deny that for a large part of the global population who will actually see this video, Starbucks is very much "the brand" associated with Arabica beans. And the point is for them to "get the point" more that to highlight the absolute best example of high quality coffee, which may very well be a brand they've never heard of & which means nothing to them. You know what I mean?	UCR_0sA5Ys-6hrYJfJbBLZIw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR_0sA5Ys-6hrYJfJbBLZIw	1	UgzQLeXtC6mL_s8OWj94AaABAg	Kiyoone

The government imposed price floor appears to have hastened the demise of the small operator who will inevitably sell out to the bigger ones and likely become a labouer, if he's lucky. No guarantees today in that department. But the large producers are still small compared with Starbucks, so price negotiations would still in the favor of the latter. This too is a common pattern today.	UCePxYwBjtH68BG8RTg-hMfg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCePxYwBjtH68BG8RTg-hMfg	1	Ugw4FpAJqmHkYV-WjPh4AaABAg	Explodingtraps

They do so by offering large contracts to large farms. Volume and technology are the greatest threats to small farmers. Volume allows the production and processing of huge amounts of beans at cheap costs through harvesting machines & wet processing the beans. Smaller farmers still do hand picking and processing on smaller machines including hand cranked types. They produce much less and their product isn't necessarily better. So if you're a purchaser, who do you choose. The big farm offering large amounts for cheap costs or the small farmer who offers smaller amounts and much higher costs? The part that Vox skipped over here is the bad choices made by the small farmers. Earlier when the pricing was fixed Colombian farmers were raking in the money. Few added new tech or reinvested in their farms. They continued to do it the old fashioned way which was labor intensive. The smart ones bought more land and added new processing technology which was expensive and took longer to pay off. But it did pay off and those guys are the ones selling to Starbucks and others. The small farmers shot themselves in the foot thinking the good times were going to be around forever. Mexico and Vietnam are two places that do coffee right. They still use smaller farms but they integrated technology early. Labor is the biggest cost of coffee production so when mechanical harvesters were added the costs went down. Profits for the farmer go up even though coffee bean prices are lower.	UCdDOJR-gqP5GVU7C7NLlfuw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdDOJR-gqP5GVU7C7NLlfuw	1	Ugw4FpAJqmHkYV-WjPh4AaABAg	Explodingtraps

There's more to capitalism than the simple supply and demand concept. Big companies have the resources and power to influence what people wants through advertising and stuff. Capitalism is able to create new, independent markets. So it's not about serving demands at all. Companies don't get big by serving demands. Regular people like you, me or them don't have anywhere near as much power to influence the market as the big companies do. They're also the "victims" of unfair business practices so it's not exactly fair to put the blame on them. What can they do? What can you do? Let's say in the best case scenario you managed to convince a thousand Starbucks customers to convert to better products. Great job. But so what? Starbucks with their resources can easily gain 100,000 new customers in no time. That's just how it works.

Colombia is one of the biggest producers of coffee beans. Nestle selling cocoa powder and such in Ivory Coast isn't just about hot chocolate. Ivory Coast is the country that produces the most cocoa beans. Shell opening gas stations in Uganda isn't just about providing fuel for cars. Uganda has a top 5 oil reserve on the entire African continent. None of these companies are providing benevolent services by taking the natural resources of these often poorer countries and then turning around and charging the indigenous people for the goods that originated on their land. Outside multinationals saddling themselves in the economy of poorer countries isn't to help their economy, they don't really. This can't just be labeled as capitalism. This is Imperialism, made possible by complicity of the local governments. Colombians are beyond capable of and already do produce delicious coffee drinks. The popularity of starbucks is confusing your palate.	UCq7PH4ZNnYtutNYpmymgYlw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq7PH4ZNnYtutNYpmymgYlw	1	Ugyy4wAveat7FhqP5kx4AaABAg	Sandra Lsms

The current dominating capatalist systems in the world benefit capatalists, whether it be individual people or companies. Multinationals having more money and thus power than individual countries. There are none or not enough regulatory devices built in which make humans or societies the main beneficiaries from the system. Oil companies have knowledge of their effect on climate since at least the seventies. But to act upon it wasn't profitable, so no one did anything. If companies can break the rules without punishment or noone getting held accountable, they will do it: for example volkswagen diesel gate. Examples are endless.

They've made a choice to grow coffee beans for the world instead of growing food for their own people, and as a result the coffee industry became oversaturated and the few big corporations in their countries are exploiting their lack of an infrastructure to ship it worldwide. This isn't something unique to coffee, it was the same way with bananas (hence the term "banana republic"), or oil filled countries, etc. It's the government that's failed them and pigeon-holed them into filling a niche in the global market, instead of letting them eke out a living for themselves. I'd rather see Columbian farmers abandon coffee beans and grow food for themselves even if it means my morning cup of coffee will be more expensive. But that's ultimately a choice for them to make. Or better yet, I'd rather see a revolution against the corruption that's exploiting them.

Those apple phones that come out constantly? The coffee drinks that are over consumed? Yeah capitalism has to have these products or it will fail. And it will fail eventually when the wage gap becomes so immense, prices of everything will skyrocket and the poor in america will be unable to live. Rent keeps rising, and that alone should tell you that its unstable. The poor in america will become 3rd world if balance isn't restored.

Ugyz6lQq4gk9LyNwWIR4AaABAg	2	21	2020-08-11 09:21:00	Kitzu	I live in the city of Armenia, Quindío, basically, along with other cities, the heart of the Zona Cafetera in Colombia. This city was built and raised from the coffee industry. We all citizens have something to do with farms and that&#39;s how we are raised here. There used to be hectares and hectares of coffee plantations all around the place, but now, it&#39;s really hard to see banana and plantain trees instead of coffee plants, it&#39;s incredibly sad how there is more street art with coffee plantations than actual coffee plantations! We are loosing our identity, our traditions and most importantly our influence, because we no longer make a living out of coffee, but out of coffee tourism, but without coffee and farmers producing it, our legacy has ended.

Unfortunately, the FDA allows coffee containing as little as 10% Kona to be labeled as Kona so most people who thought they tried real Kona on the mainland probably got gypped.

Starbucks had a bigger presence in the suburbs between 2004-2008. The GFC forced them to close underperforming stores. Most people prefer to go to good independent coffee stores, where some actually use boutique coffee roasters beans, just to differentiate themselves from other coffee stores nearby. There are some that just want to sell “average” coffee to people who just enjoy a cappuccino and don’t fuss over subtle flavours, and then there are the boutique ones that will sell 2-3 types of coffee beans. Usually an everyday middle-of -the -road blend, then a single origin blend, and a blend for their cold drip coffee.

I am very happy that people like coffee,its brought income to farmers around the world but I heard that climate change could reduce coffee production by half in a couple of decades. And different places are unique because of type of soil,geography and climate, thus it is a great loss if they are lost let alone the countries loss of income. Very sad as Trumpie would say.

And since people have been drinking there for 3500 years and where coffee is naturally found i would say that I have tasted the most variety. There are some provinces that are especially good coffee but the farmers keep for themselves and friends. We have a coffee ceremony that is similar to tea ceremony of japan. So yes I can say that Ethiopia has the best. Another thing when coffee companies sell the coffee mass market the coffee is for eg 90% Colombian and the rest is Ethiopian to give it quality.

UgyxrxCCe4gblV8Vtlh4AaABAg	0	0	2020-10-13 02:26:20	Daviidrod69	Hello there! I am speaking based on having worked first hand in a specialty cafe in Los Angeles and witnessing the unsustainability of coffee. I think a large part of this issue, aside from climate change, is what happens after the coffee is picked. Most times cafe owners, in cities like LA and New York, are stubborn about paying farmers a reasonable price for their labor. To an extent, it is not their fault. Rising labor costs in the US have made it more difficult for owners to pay high prices for coffee while also paying their employees livable wages. The majority of my paychecks were comprised of tips. This mixed bag of labor costs in the US and the need to pay farmers reasonable prices while keeping a cup of coffee at a reasonable price has created so much uncertainty. For the longest, I have been very critical of the coffee market around the globe for treating coffee as a given. The video did a good job of explaining that most farmers are barely breaking even or growing at a loss. The only reason you are able to go to Starbucks and pay a few bucks for your cup is due to the injustice about wages paid to farmers. But what happens when you start to pay farmers a fair price? All of a sudden your cup of coffee that cost ~$5 , it is now ~$10+ and no one wants to pay that for a cup of coffee and now the coffee market has crashed. When you can support farmers. Make connections with local coffee shops that truly support the idea of paying their farmers livable wages. Don’t take coffee for granted.

Robusta is more hardy, but it carries the more traditional bitter taste and high acidity that is largely absent in fancy coffee. Michael Pollan has a great book called &quot;Caffeine&quot; that explains the distinction well.	UCA_Tspb5bBGndwZSxDv7aJA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCA_Tspb5bBGndwZSxDv7aJA	0

Interested in the transition to Robusta, we will adapt and survive, but you'll never get me to drink nescafe... even dandelion root or chicory beats that garbage. Interested if someone has a recommendation as well.	UCv8e8TBardcCKLDuBlTRemQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCv8e8TBardcCKLDuBlTRemQ	1	Ugxy9KQDGbEPmHNopEl4AaABAg	Jacob Stratton

The biggest distinction between them is the "full body" flavour of arabica and caffeine content. In reality the coffee that is sold in Starbucks and other coffee shops around the globe are "blended" or a mixture of arabica and robusta beans, and these are not even the highest grade of coffee beans available. In Indonesia you will find a "single-origin" coffee culture in coffee houses and these coffee beans are not exported because they are too expensive for overseas market.

If you care about coffee, buy single origin. Those roasters are typically buying direct from the farmers, or from coops and distributors who are a direct link to smaller farmers, pay above the artificially low market price in order to sustain the industry, and help the small farmers keep their land and maintain their business.

Which is A) FairTrade anyway and B) massively inflated in price for profits. It's not actually that you can't afford to buy good beans, you just like to buy coffee and have a cup you can drink instead of making it yourself. Don't get me wrong, I buy high street coffee sometimes. But making my own and bringing it with me in an insulated cup tastes 10x better. You can buy an entire 500g or 1kg bag of beans for the price of a SBux cup or two.

Paying farmers for their product keeps the money circulating, while forcing everyone to pennypinch keeps the money stagnant. And THAT'S why the USA (as a political institution) likes its situation, because it's better for the corporations. The USA is one of the only countries that doesn't have minimum wage rise automatically every year. Some Americans balk at the idea of the amount of tax we pay on petrol in Europe but those taxes allow for better public transport and not making everyone have to have a car in the first place, and people with cars just tend to buy hatchbacks instead of pickup trucks. It's a real chicken and egg situation. The progress is impeded by politicians and taxes and wages, and that also keeps the farmers down when they can't charge more because people can't afford to buy it.

But the cappuccino, in particular, is not really high quality. If you start researching or find a really good cappuccino store you will never want to drink Starbucks again ;) Starbucks is, like Mc Donalds or Burger King, a store for the masses.

It's an easy to understand visual representation of a measurement that helps communicate the true size of something in a way that makes it seem more tangible than numbers. I think you're just being stuck up. The most important thing is that people understand the information, not how they understand it.

These people can adapt to the climate. Unless I should be worrying that the land owners who could grow the highest value produce are having to move down market? That’s a problem solved by eliminating land ownership. Let them pay rent according to the locational value.	UCxuz_GbkYxXgV4scWWxlD2w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxuz_GbkYxXgV4scWWxlD2w	0

UgyoCXcT8cpyHmqw9xp4AaABAg	0	21	2020-08-12 00:08:01	Dylan Chua	Hi! Just a small correction here. The video implied that robusta beans are “not the good stuff”, and shouldn’t be used for high quality coffee! However, good blends will likely use both robusta and arabica beans. This is because robusta, although having a strong stereotypical coffee taste, lacks the complexity that arabica brings. On the other side of the coin, arabica lacks the intensity that robusta can bring to the table. For single origin coffees, we use arabica to gain a complex and intricate profile, however don’t discount the value of robusta beans too! thanks everyone! shop local, and remember to do your part to be more sustainable 🌱 💕	UC3-yFD-zZ7gdpGNCzIMpLcA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3-yFD-zZ7gdpGNCzIMpLcA	0

There will be shortages of food, lack of energy resources. Many places will become uninhabitable in the future because of changing climate and the loss of water. It is not like the past where the rich can content themselves with their own personal pursuits, hobbies and obsessions and the rest of society struggles and declines.

The current rate of climate change is not nearly enough to wipe out humans for centuries. The rich will always live comfortably, and well-developed countries will sustain themselves. The risk is losing wildlife, types of plants (case in point), and many coastal cities and populations. This will cause turmoil and issues, but no where near extinction or the end of humanity. Plus we are now slowly moving to space, and other planets, which provide the rich with a further safety net. In short, as you say, it's not the end of humanity.

That cannot be fair.<br /><br />Let&#39;s remember the farmers who grow the food we enjoy and do what we can to improve their lot , by choosing options like Fairtrade, whilst pushing for broader change.

Basically the number of retailers is extremely low and decreasing compared to the number of farmers. (Think about Walmart, Starbucks, Nestlé, or Lidl and Carrefour in Europe which are mega-corporations) This leads to a common situation: farmers by their own have virtually no influence on the price. They have lost practically all bargaining power. In agriculture you see this a lot: dairy products, vegetables, etc. 3) These retailers can afford to low the prices to compete to each other, and then they transfer (part) of the cost burden to previous actors in the supply chain. I can tell you that, as far as I know, overproduction is absolutely not the problem. In fact, instant coffee factories in Colombia are suffering right now to find good quality coffee and are launching programs of fair trade precisely because it's starting to affect their profits. The game of low-price competition has reached its limits.	UCyAot3KGO30zKn3DT5-y1yw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyAot3KGO30zKn3DT5-y1yw	1	Ugz1sKA8G98_fF0eez54AaABAg	TheJalipa

People in places like Japan and USA are visiting their local coffee shops less often and businesses are no longer providing free of charge onsite coffee as they’ve moved to work from home setups to comply with stay at home directives. This has an effect on coffee smallholders but also on discretionary export producers in general.

Eventually as temperatures increase the other areas will get hit as well. Also over production is only one reason as to why prices lower, it could also be that most markets before were charging more as a way to garner more profits but now newer regions are charging less cause they have less bargaining power.

The logical thing is to pressure their own government to start to get off fossil fuels for example, or other things that can mitigate global warming. Also, if you've ever looked at the charts and data on average climate across the centuries, you'd know there was a big change starting during the Industrial Revolution. The effects of human activity isn't overstated. I don't disagree that some political actors can be over-the-top about it, but it *is* serious and it *does* require countries to make certain big changes.

I've run some blind taste tests with my friends on this sort of thing. And when I say fail, I mean consistently pick the starbucks, to P=0.05 for a T-test. I'm not saying Starbucks is great, I'm just saying you snobs are full of it.	UCVeahPBre3Q1vC19I5WYP-Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVeahPBre3Q1vC19I5WYP-Q	1	Ugxi1eeL1XbsT5ary_V4AaABAg	Spooogey 1

I don't think you understand what communism is, the barter "system" is just a primal way for people to get what they wan't with mutual agreements and is a staple of tribalism/any society that hasn't evolved economics.

We can automate all the laborious jobs; freeing man to pursue what ever he is passionate about. Without a price tag. Where ever you want study. I know it sounds like a Utopia.

More countries are flooding the market with cheap coffee. Ok I understand climate change was and is a factor in the amount of money these farmers make. I also appreciate that Vox is presenting all the information available in this persuasive video. However, at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IN4ZcZAUbA&amp;t=4m07s">4:07</a> they say that the amount of land dedicated to farming these beans has dropped 7%. Now, what percentage of this 7% drop is due to the loss of business because the influx of cheap coffee? From an economist perspective, It seems to me that they&#39;re losing market share because people who want to drink cheap coffee are buying from retailers who purchase from these cheap coffee farms. Before this, those customers were force to buy more expensive, price regulated coffee. I&#39;d imagine when the demand for expensive Colombian coffee exceeds the amount these farms produce, the farms can hike up the export price and start to make money again.

Grow up and actually try to make a change instead of writing 4 numbers and going on with your day doing the exact same thing you always do. Everyone always preaches change but nobody ever feels the urge or has the drive to actually do it and maintain it. Until the common individual realizes that what they do matters things will keep getting worse and continue to pile up over the next coming years too. These problems aren't going to go away when the year ends so instead of complaining about the year instead look at yourself and how you impact these issues. Through self awareness we can make change and truly help the world.

This should be titled, &quot;neoliberal trade agreements threatens the viability of coffee production and the livelihood of Colombian workers&quot;, but I guess that isn&#39;t as click-worthy.

That's why you see companies like McDonald's changing to arabica beans. They show a Starbucks coffee as "high quality" because that's what it is compared to instant coffee. It's a coffee made by a barista with company wide serving standards set for quality and consistency.

Ugy3dlv0f8GTxFVoqEx4AaABAg	0	0	2020-08-12 09:25:03	Sharath Rao	This episode reminded me of my earlier days when my work involved visiting coffee plantations in India (Chikkamagalur dist, Karnataka). This is one of the three districts in Karnataka state where the climate and the conditions are suitable to grow Arabica &amp; Robusta - if I am not mistaken, ~95% of India&#39;s coffee comes from these three districts. This was late 90s and the coffee prices were at its peak. Back than the estate owners were on a consumer frenzy - buying latest electronic gadgets, latest cars, you name it. There were instances where estate owners had even hired guards in their house just to monitor coffee beans and to protect them against thieves who would come to steal them (beans are kept in open for drying on the courtyard). This was followed by dot com bust and the coffee prices too went south. Lot of the vehicles esp. which were bought on loan were re-possessed as customer was unable to make monthly payments. Thanks Vox for bringing back the memories and for the good journalism/narration.	UCR31kameZ169u0kxbab7XIQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR31kameZ169u0kxbab7XIQ	0

Yes tons of crops will fail, yes that&#39;s a lot of lost effort, but the few successes might create an even tastier coffee, and it will keep the plants from becoming susceptible to insects or diseases to wipe everything out (ie the old banana). The climate will always be changing, that you cannot change, adapt and learn new methods.	UCJ90G6uJDyOA_n2QIZKGUXw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ90G6uJDyOA_n2QIZKGUXw	0

For example, at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IN4ZcZAUbA&amp;t=3m02s">3:02</a>, you say that &quot;greenhouse gas emissions have warmed the region by 1.2 degrees celsius since 1980.&quot; That means that one of your sources claims to have proven with good peer reviewed science both that this temperature difference occurred and that the CAUSE of this temperature difference is due only (or perhaps mostly?) to greenhouse gas emissions. I&#39;m not saying this didn&#39;t happen, I&#39;m saying it&#39;s a reaaallly bold claim, as that kind of cause and effect relationship would be pretty tough to prove with empirical evidence. I&#39;d love to see the source on that (and several other claims you make throughout the video), but your sources are mixed in with &quot;additional reading&quot; and at least three of your links listed bring up an &quot;error 404 page not found&quot; message (on my end at least), while others are locked behind a publisher&#39;s paywall (i.e. I&#39;d have to pay $39.95 USD to access that article at the bottom by Andy Jarvis). <br /><br />So after watching this video, I can either:<br />A) Choose to either blindly trust these &quot;facts&quot; that I cannot access the data or original source for;<br />B) Spend a day digging hard and paying lots of money to maybe access the data in question; <br />C) Just shrug and say &quot;I have no idea if the argument holds any water whatsoever, so it means next to nothing to me.&quot;<br /><br />Which would you pick?

If other countries/families sell their crops at very low prices, that creates pressure on everyone to sell cheaper. Starbucks (and other distributors) takes advantage, but it's not like their fault alone. That is why trade agreements are so important (and why farmers get so angry when the governments sign free trade agreements with every country, accepting to eliminate fees from their foreign competitors and creating even further pressure to lower the prices).

Look, I'm Colombian and I don't drink coffee, but this isn't about if you drink coffee or not; it's about the struggles of those who depend on coffee production to sustain themselves, about our whole economy and culture.

I want to sit down and pause every several seconds to read so I can&#39;t do absolutely anything else.

UgzfmBIx4Ocifz2sCUx4AaABAg.9CBuktPJEIH9CD-eULyIRW		2	2020-08-11 08:21:44	Esme Crawford	Capitalism is part of what causes big corporations to fail the community environmentally. High carbon emissions from things like mass production, factory farming, etc., are a negative externality, so the people or the government should step up and create penalties for businesses that are polluting. Negative externalities are a market failure, and are the result of imperfections with capitalism (no type of economy is perfect). In a completely capitalistic society, there would be no government to correct the problem. The U.S. and many European countries are actually mixed economies. The problem is that the U.S.’s current government is trying to get rid of government intervention as a solution. But honestly, it’s not just capitalism’s fault; other factors like global politics are affecting the problems discussed in the video.

After the video i went to make another cup and thought to myself how the little things are what i need to be grateful for and not take for granted like this ☕that is so readily available to me because according to the info i just saw it seems coffee wont be as easily obtained for my son when he&#39;s an old coffee fiend-he&#39;s 14 and already drinks a cup a day of the lightly caffienated stuff aka me using a k-cup twice on low 6oz setting😅-still coffee tho and will effect a kid without effecting cost lol.

Back in the &#39;80&#39;s and &#39;90s we grew coffee coz it was profitable... so profitable that the gov put their corrupt paws on it. The govenment under the then president Moi was also focused on making tea strongee because tea was grown in his area while coffee was in Central and Eastern provinces. so, the coffee board of Kenya was ransacked and farmers like my grandparents and parents had no choice but to cut down the trees and plant maize and beans... these are plants that had taken yeara to grow... now, the farms have gotten smaller and the desire for coffee farming is only high to thosw who can afford to wait for years... if production was to increase, the whole sector would need to be redesigned. Yep. Okay. But the perspextive is needed because ypu are not going to see farmers abandoning their foos crops for cash crops anytime soon.

Even in Mexico, a country with a cooler climate, grows coffee with bananas. Maybe Colombia should have started growing other crops like avocados, or they should have invested in research in hardier coffee strains. Other countries have and have adapted.

The Columbian government&#39;s decision to divide the plantations into smaller farms might have been a good decision politically but it came at a cost as small-scale farming is less economical. Larger farms would have more resources to adapt to climate change. Absent consolidation, Columbia&#39;s only options to preserve the industry and coffee-producing culture are probably subsidy, the reestablishment an international cartel and coffee tourism.

In addition to that there is leaf rust, and the main villain in coffee farms that you see exclusively in India the white stem borer insect a great threat to arabica. But despite all there are great initiatives taken by global coffee industry players, roasters ,retailers, research organisations, governments to support farmers.but it need results and it should reach small holders who are the back borne of coffee industry .we have to save farmers otherwise they will leave this field, later you won&#39;t get a chance to sip the origin diversity in coffee. You have to compromise for some three to four countries for coffee and that too you can&#39;t guarantee the quality.

Take for example the greenhouses used in the Netherlands, controlled environment in which all types of vegetables and other plants can be grown. Adapting such an infrastructure-style could maybe help preserve this beautiful piece of cultural heritage (throughout the world). Adapting the technology available to accommodate the cultivation towards the future would be a solution. <br /><br />But for that you would need a large fund (one which in 2020 isn&#39;t really easy). You would need to make it a global agenda to ensure the saving of a worldwide culture by saving the local culture. I would reckon a global instance such as Unesco would have the resources to start on this.<br /><br />Get funding, innovate and improve the cultivation.

You need the right elevation and enough wet and dry seasons. The latitude shifting north means less potential land to grow said crops i.e. lower elevation and actually less area as well moving into desert regions. This is the essence of the argument with the estimate being 50% of less “arable” land. Arable being the keyword here.

Find places that are committed to helping their growers. The main one I know about is Groundwork Coffee. They have their AMUCC/Fuerza Femenina that helps Colombian growers and I think they did something recently with their African growers? Honestly, reading about their programs are pretty cool. They&#39;re in LA, but they ship everywhere. And the coffee is SO GOOD... I can actually drink it without adding anything to it.

I can truly say growing coffee here may be a thing of the past by 2050. In addition to climate change there is another problem. For some reason, alot of our coffee farms happen to exist around major towns and cities including the capital. As our middle classes and cities grow, our coffee farms are quickly being converted into suburbia which to the land owners is more profitable than coffee.

The only thing that &quot;might&quot; hurt the market is a lack of workers due to Covid or even transportation. That scenario is unlikely. Honestly i only watched 3 minutes of the video but unless the point they are getting at is in 20 years we wont have coffee lol, this video is nonsense	UCM0_sFj8ijrJuvWBRMsojNQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCM0_sFj8ijrJuvWBRMsojNQ	0

Im genuinely interested in the effects of climate change and this overall docu-mini but I genuinely am offended and literally quit the video after hearing that statement. Good day to you inferior sub-humans.	UCCuGQdpAo3MQ_a4h8eCwQBg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCuGQdpAo3MQ_a4h8eCwQBg	0

I don’t mean to offend anyone by where I get my coffee from, but how much “better” does hot water and beans get? I feel like it’s perfection already... anyone? 😅	UC6uymWGIo8vTvXAxwlaMsbw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6uymWGIo8vTvXAxwlaMsbw	0

Whole towns are just waiting.<br />It has come to a point that coffee farms are left to waste, no harvest, because it just doesn&#39;t make any money.
