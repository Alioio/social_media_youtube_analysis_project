If every country stopped producing CO2, it would take nearly a century for the effects to be felt due to how long it stays in the atmosphere. We might have a chance if we find a way to trap and remove it from the atmosphere. But tbh the emissions would have to be cut 50% over the long term for things to get better.

Temperature rise lowers crop nutrition. We have evolved in a relatively stable system do you really think rapidly changing the chemical makeup of the atmosphere is a good thing and we should not care? U.K. Met office predicts UK will have a climate like Barcelona by 2050! What effect do you think that would have on our native species of plants and trees and you have to consider what the f. K Barcelonas climate be like? Humanities resource overshoot is currently running at around 1.5 planet Earths a year , human population has gone from around 3.5 billion to around 7.5 in the last 40, 50 years and growing. We are destroying nature faster than ever before . Infinite growth on a finite planet is not going to work. Global Industrial civilisation is on a suicide mission. Guess whatever I say or evidence I bring I will not change your mind. and I am the same . I have looked at the evidence across climate change, politics, biodiversity loss, pollution, micro plastics in the environment and food chain. pesticides in the environment. Population, resources overshoot, extinction rates, Arctic amplification, Arctic methane. thawing permafrost. Global food and fresh water projections for the coming decades, ocean acidification, stratification, deoxygenation. My conclusion is we are turning nature to cash as fast as we can with no concern for our biosphere and or web of life. If your understanding of co2 is different to mine so be it but we have many more to fear regardless of climate change, of that I hope we can both agree üëç	UCfo3nvvM4A-hjQUZD3oKOgA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfo3nvvM4A-hjQUZD3oKOgA	1	UgwJhyxK2AET4xWB2nF4AaABAg	Above The Noise

Accodring to *Ideal Gas Law* - a base law of gases&atmospheres - CO2 is nothing special and no different than other. Proven with my calculations and REPEATABLE result of *1000Frolly* - they agree with direct planet observation. I did calculations for every planet. All results were that same. Sorry but 6 planets and one moon are laughing from your lies. PV=nRT not CO2=T... I DO NOT care you trust him or not. Take the "meteorology subject" lesson in *Engineering College* like me. 2. As a scientinst, not the fool, oceans are BASIC and ALWAYS will be basic because basalt rock that ocean lies on it, is always alcaline, full of metal oxides. More there: https://youtu.be/4bJjBo5ICMc?t=14m36s Patric Moore is one of the *Greenpeace* founders... 3. Climate is always changing, now we have change from "little Ice Age" when permafrosts were formed. Methane as we described is not a GHG gas. 4. During the winter in your own room CO2 schoot high as 1700 ppm, you never noticed, don't you? Your pets and plants too... 5. Plants love CO2, their optimal level is 1200 ppm. Proven. More of this gas equal: www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-nsU_DaIZE 6. *NASA, NOAA and IPCC* are proven liars, here is the past compilation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vyig6r8lgWE *Tony Heller* has TONS of usefull videos https://youtu.be/VNy7tTY0Vek?t=651 - a HORRIBLE KO for NASA 7.

Then we can look at the fossil fuel industry's own scientific analysis of climate change and the burning of fossil fuels known some 30 years ago that correctly predicted current emissions and temperature rise and effects to the biosphere. Hopefully even if you don't agree with climate change you are on board with the ecological disaster we are creating regardless of climate change. Never before have there been so many people with the technology to convert nature to cash at such a rate.

With regards to co2 equals life that's a fair statement to a point but have you ever heard the saying ( to much of a good thing ). Current life on Earth evolved in a atmosphere of around 280 to 300 ppm co2 if we continue to bump it up in only a few decades it will move away from the balanced levels current life evolved in. Like water right, it keeps you alive... Let me force feed you water for 24 to 48 hours and see if you flourish. Also you can have all the co2 you like for plants but it won't do much good if there are major droughts forest fires or salt water incursion from rising sea lvls or indeed sustained flooding. What happens when global temps move above the threshold of what current life evolved to withstand in vast parts of the planet. This whole co2 is life is a misconception yes it plays its part to a point but we are talking about tipping the scales away from a balanced system. I'm glad you are with me on the way we are destroying the environment, it's as alarming and catastrophic as climate change for sure.

As you said, anything and everything makes a difference. Give up Netflix - yes all those servers consume LOTS of power. Give up Cell Phones - the phones don't use much; but, the land based services that support them do. Live without a car (obvious benefit). The reality is the real thing that is fueling Global Warming is out comfort and convenience. Actually, I take that back, my convenience is not a big deal, it is everyone else's that is really causing it. That's right, it is everyone else's fault (including you Gretta).

(Add some progressive taxation to make sure the people on the poverty line are not pushed below it.) Local food should get a price advantage that will encourage local and vertical farming to boom. Also Im not vegan but you don't have to be vegan to phase in some vegan dinners. The word always implies an entire lifestyle. I do look for meat free products and meat imitations. I just think it is very interesting. My individual choice does not really make much difference but it probably helps grow the market.

About 12% of the global population is responsible for most greenhouse emissions, resource consumption, and environmental degradation. The US being 4% of the global population consumes 20% of energy. The American consumer culture has to end and there is no compromise on the matter if we're entertaining the thought mitigating environmental damage. Similiar to how right-wing libertarians blame economic woes on central banks and governments as the root cause of the problem. While ignoring that they are merely mechanisms in which an unstable distribution system functions.

But we still have some major challenges and complications ahead.<br />As someone who is studying electrical engineering, one challenge with renewables like wind and solar is grid stability. Even if wind and solar were not dependant on weather and time of day, the fact that these technologies interface with the grid using electronics rather than heavy turbines running at grid frequency means that they do not add stability to the grid. This can be counteracted by use of flywheel storage or by using synchronous condensers, but such things are an added expense.<br />Hydro is the only reliable renewable that provides large amounts of stable power. Though Hydro is very location-specific. Fission power is also a reliable carbon-neutral power source and it is honestly safer than coal, but it tends to be expensive to start-up and maintain and does produce small amounts of hard to deal with waste.<br /><br /><br />Basically, it isn&#39;t as easy as saying, just use wind and solar. I know that it is hard to cover complex topics in short videos.	UCBqROuCskdB2iM0xW8GE9IQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBqROuCskdB2iM0xW8GE9IQ	0

If we have 10-15 years to get off fossil fuels, as some predict, then we are doomed. That timeframe can&#39;t be done. If we have 50 years, it may be possible. I think what we will see is very little cultural change and an acceptance of the consequences.	UCn-YCTCei2XEiK2OV6IIt2A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn-YCTCei2XEiK2OV6IIt2A	0

That increase is due almost entirely to humans burning fossil fuels, mostly from 1950 on. &quot; How did a massive increase in co2 after 1950 cause a warming that began 80 years earlier? Half of the 1¬∞c warming of the last 140 years occurred before 1950 but almost all of the co2 increase occurred after it.

He won a Nobel Prize for peace, not science, and he is a professor of energy, not climate. Too many of the scientists driving the hype and creating panic have their degree in some other area of science than climate. If you needed brain surgery, would you consult with a proctologist?

He did get both a Master's and PhD in Physics, after all. Also, just because it was a Peace Prize doesn't mean it's scientifically invalid. Peace Prizes are given out to anything considered specifically significant for mankind's advancement and that qualifies to the committee.

If you noticed the wording of my comment, you would have seen that I made that distinction when I said that he "won a Nobel Prize for peace, not for science". My reasoning behind stating that is that the host specifically said that their "climate expert" was a professor of energy and a member of the UN climate panel that won the Nobel Peace Prize. But, to be clear, yes, I am aware that the Nobel Prize has many categories.	UCov69_uziJsIWz6wHWa4RPw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCov69_uziJsIWz6wHWa4RPw	1	UgxIrnlGtX9UqcifBi54AaABAg	Bear Barre

Of course, you have to say that. If you don&#39;t some people will get mad.<br />But we don&#39;t hear sentences like &quot;I don&#39;t want to tell anyone to not steal from his neighbour&quot; or &quot;I don&#39;t want to tell anyone to not beat up his neighbour&quot;. We don&#39;t hear anyone say that others shouldn&#39;t tell you what to do there because something like that is just a personal decision. Simply because it is not a personal decision. Your neighbour is affected by that decision in a negative way and by definition that makes it a non-personal decision.<br />But at least by now, we know that the way people in the western civilisation eat meat others (and even themselves) will feel negative effects. When we include animals and not just other humans even eating meat just occasionally has negative effects on others.<br />So perhaps it&#39;s time to accept that eating meat, especially in those high amounts, is not just a personal decision because others are affected by it in a negative way. So perhaps it actually is time to tell others how to eat (and of course also how to produce energy, how and how often to travel, how to go to work, ...).

And that after I just objectively described what I think is the definition of a personal decision and why that does not apply to eating meat. So you're not really in the best position of accusing me to be personal. Please tell me why I should stay nice and polite and can't even tell you to shut up if you can't tell me why I'm wrong or don't want to admit that you're wrong, while you did start this conversation as you did. And if me assuming your motivation of refusing to make any counter-arguments was already too personal for you, that was after you decided to not make any counter-arguments. So that can't be the reason. If I am a person that won't be swayed no matter what the other side will write, please think about how this also applies to you. I'm the last one who actually made some points. You didn't react to them in any way. Instead, you just explained the same point to someone else, ignoring my explanation of why vegans at least kill fewer animals while still killing animals. And you're still accusing me of being the person who's not interested in a rational exchange. That doesn't make much sense. When you first wrote that you don't want to continue this discussion anymore we didn't even have a long back and forth of actual arguments. It was just my main comment for this thread, a comment from you, which didn't even have anything to do with my original comment, and then me asking a question about your comment. That's it. Just three comments. If you don't want to continue the discussion after such a short exchange it's not really that credible that you actually think I'm not worth the exchange and much more likely that you just prefer not to be swayed because you don't have good counter-arguments. Also, it doesn't really help your point that you're still arguing with me about not wanting to argue with me. Apparently, you have the time for this discussion and your urge of wanting to be right is not smaller than mine. Otherwise, you wouldn't be here anymore. And after 7 comments and 3 days, you won't convince anyone that that's not the case by just stopping to comment right now.

You're not interested in a rational exchange you just need to be right. That's what motivates bullies, you can't let it go you had to chime back in. Your aggressive, hostile comments told me that trying to have an exchange of ideas with you would be pointless. I've gone down this track before, the more I would point out the holes in your argument the more personal your attacks on me would become and after devoting hours to the exchange you wouldn't have budged an inch because for you it's not about exchanging ideas it's instead just about having an argument and that's something I'm not prepared to put time into.

It's practically impossible to grow enough food for 7.7 billion humans without killing some animals at some point. So there is no perfect diet and any reasonable vegan knows that. But Hansca is completely ignoring that you have to grow much more crop to feed livestock than if you would grow just the amount you would eat yourself. So while it's true what Hansca is writing about the negative side of a vegan diet, the same thing happens on a much bigger scale for an omnivore diet.

You find it everywhere these days. It's a plant-based product but it's consumed by vegans and non-vegans alike. And please stop with soy. You have to produce much more soy in the first place to even get the beef you're talking about. 77% of the soy yield is used to feed livestock, around 20% is used for nutritional oil (which is used by vegan and non-vegan people), around 2% is used for vegan alternatives, and around 1% is used for industrial oil (which is used by vegan and non-vegan people). So how are vegans the reason soy cultivation is destroying the environment? When 77% of the soy yield is used as food for livestock I would rather worry about eating meat. Even if it's really counter-intuitive but since livestock needs food you need to plant fewer plants for a vegan diet than for an omnivore diet. "Vegan increase also requires more poisonous fertilizers that destroy soil eco system" And since fewer plants need less fertalizer you also have to use less fertilizer for a vegan diet. Overall, the problem with soy and the environment is not soy in general but the way how we produce soy and how much. Growing some soy in your backyard isn't a problem. A simple farmer who is growing soy, potatoes, wheat, peas, and corn, while switching the field for every plant species every year, still isn't a problem. It gets problematic when farmers put monocultures of genetically modified soy for several years on the same giant fields and use a lot of fertilizer until nothing grows there anymore. And that is necessary because the world needs so much soy for livestock. If we would only grow soy for direct consumption we would need way less soy and wouldn't have to grow it that way. But if you actually think soy in general already is a problem the most simple solution still is just don't eat soy products. Being vegan does not mean you have to eat soy products all the time. There are enough other plants that can be used for fake meat or plant-based milk. If you even buy products like fake meat or plant-based milk. "these r exotic foods with many food miles, often airplanes." Transporting food over half of the globe isn't good for the environment. But the soy that is used directly for food in Europe mostly is also grown in Europe. And the USA is one of the world's biggest soy exporters. So I doubt that there is much foreign soy in tofu that was produced in the USA. So I wouldn't really call soy in Europe or the USA more exotic than eating a potato in Europe that was grown by a European farmer. The origin of the potato is in South America but today we also grow it in Europe without a problem. Replace "South America" with "Asia" and you can say the same thing about soy. "often airplanes." Airplanes? Seriously? If we would talk about bananas, avocados or other fruits we wouldn't have to discuss that. But bananas and avocado, just like palm oil, don't replace animal products and are consumed also by non-vegans. We're talking about soy. Soy doesn't go bad as fast as fruits and is transported by ship rather than by airplane. From an economical perspective, it would be stupid to transport soy by airplane if you could also just use a ship. But "by airplane" just sounds so much worse, so let's write "by airplane". Right? Of course, that doesn't mean that the transportation of soy by ship (which as stated mostly ends up as food for livestock anyway) doesn't have a bad impact on the environment, but it really makes clear how questionable you handle your information. It looks like you try to remember anything bad you heard about food at some point, put it in a blender, mix it up, and then find out how you can apply that goo in the blender to veganism. "Soy has to much phytooestrogen to b used as a staple" Yes, the phytoestrogen in soy can be a problem. But not as long as you eat reasonable amounts. Just like you don't drown from one glass of water. It's the same thing as always. Don't eat too much of XY or it starts being unhealthy. It's the same thing with meat, eggs, and milk. And we don't make our tofu really different than Asians do. Soy in Europe and the USA is also fermented when making tofu. We don't use a completely different recipe just because we are not Asian. And much fake meat has tofu as a base product. But in the end as a vegan, you don't have to choose between "no soy at all" and "soy for everything". Just like you can eat "a healthy amount of processed and red meat" even though the WHO linked processed and red meat to a higher risk of cancer, there is also "just eat a healthy amount of soy" as a third option. And it doesn't even matter how high that healthy amount is since there always is the option of going vegan without eating any soy at all. "Vegan oils r higher in bad fats too (bar coconut and olive)" Please tell that to the people at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston. I don't think they would agree with you. https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/321285.php And not just them. It really is not big news that the best fat you can get is unsaturated fat from plants and fish. So I really wonder how you can come up with vegan health problems linked to bad fats. "Amazon was able to support cities with millions!" Perhaps the Amazon was able to support a few cities with millions of citizens. But today there are 208 million people in Brazil and 7.7 billion in the world. We can't produce our food the way people did centuries ago. Food forests could be interesting for a village of a native tribe in the middle of the Amazon or perhaps even if someday humans will start colonizing other planets. But it won't feed the modern civilization of 7.7 billion people. Perhaps it would have been a good idea not to become so overpopulated in the first place, but now we're all here and we have to eat something. With so many people we have to industrialize the way we produce food in some way to make it efficient. And that won't happen when the food has to be picked by hand in the forest. So we have to look for an industrializable diet with the highest efficiency and the lowest impact on the environment. And while veganism isn't the simple answer to everything (vegans don't claim it is) growing soy and other plants to eat them directly still has much higher efficiency and a lower impact on the environment than feeding plants to animals to eat animal products. We could get rid of 25% of all greenhouse gasses just by going vegan. If you don't agree don't argue with me, argue with the climate expert in the video who won a Nobel Prize with the UN climate panel.

Frankly, we r in a situation where there IS no silver bullet answer for each problem we see. There ARE enough people myself inc who'd be VERY interested at living a simpler agrarian lifestyle (what i propose was also the mainstay diet of rural medieval folk) and i guess i really am talking from a rural point of view. it wld be very easy for everyone here to 'dig for britain' again, producing their own veggies, fruit n nuts, but i agree, impossible for urban folk. im in the odd position of living in a social flat in a village with only public access outside my door. i was denied permission to grow a few herbs 5 yrs ago in the communal garden. i dunno where ur from, but in uk we have 30-40 harvests left in our soils. we already import 50-60% of our food. last year, we dipped into our 5-year reserves. This year's harvest wont have replaced any of that. If UK converted to food forest agriculture (pretending it wldnt fragment n bankrupt many who struggle with transition) it COULD produce 100% of the food it consumes AND refertilise the soils n stop the soil erosion which is also a big problem in uk. We need trees, their roots n ecosystems to rebuild n refertilise our soils. frankly, only no till methods of agriculture should be used. IF we focused on nutrition density, we could handle less food in our bellies. When i ate this diet for 3 months last year as a test, i had tonnes of energy, but only WANTED to eat once a day. i cut down on my food costs too. it was simply too much hard work cooking from scratch when i was also learning HOW to cook XD This summer, i once worked out that uk can only guarantee being able to feed 20-30% of it's population. All the 'food baskets' we import from have also been suffering from smaller crop yields last few years. Russia already had to stop exporting once n led to one of the arab/muslim wars in recent years. We have been neglecting our soils for too long. They are dying. DESPITE the uk's soils being among the youngest n healthiest thanks to the ice sheet that covered uk until 12k yrs ago. The last thing we need is for our soils to have more stress. The earth needs her covering of green, not brown n naked exposed to the winds, frozen precipitation n chemicals which is what happens when a field is 'resting' or seeded in uk. So this is what lies behind my fear. that cos going vegan looks like the right choice, cos not enough understand how current ag destroys our soils n we dnt have many harvests left, we end up in a situation where our soils no longer support life. Not even organic farming replaces what it takes from the soil. only no till food forests replace n return life to the earth which can then nurture the plants on which our part of the eco-system depends upon. Hope that makes my stance clearer n prehaps gives u something to explore :) i believe scientific american is where i got this info from first, but last time i looked to link the article, it had been removed. the article originally said uk produces 40%, but recently, cos of brexit, iv found articles saying uk produces more than 40%, up to 60% Sadly, not even DEFRA seem to be taking this issue seriously enough. At best, all ive seen are 'farmers weekly' (magazine) with articles about benefits of no till, biodynamic, food forests etc. Only 30% of those farmers ive spoken to about this issue were as aware of how serious this is as myself	UCKYN_Q4NN7S76UGMTgDs90A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKYN_Q4NN7S76UGMTgDs90A	1	UgydvJ5M5BY4lwDE_eV4AaABAg	Joe Jupiter

It takes far more land (and water, pesticides, and fertilizer) to generate a calorie of meat than a calorie of plants. Your suggestion to revert back to hunter-gatherer food collection is not realistic. The best thing we 7+ billion can do is feed ourselves in the least harmful way that is possible, not the least harmful way that is impossible.

What we need are food forests n food FROM forests, so we support forests n encourage those who produce food to look after the trees soil etc not destroy them. Sadly, although most agree food forests capeable of feeding more than current ag practices, its very labour intensive. imo, its the ONLY way though. Everyone should be producing their own food as much as poss. im converting half my lounge into a growing room as i have no money, land, garden, patio, balcony etc in short, veg/an diets destroy soil n micro-organisms. grasslands have greater biodiversity. There is also that bar cutting down more forest, which gives us short-term soil for crops, we already have in production all land suitable for growing crops. all that remains is only suitable for grasslands n other non-crop producing ecosystems (marshes) yeah beef n sheep r bad consider other meats like rabbit -uk's number 1 pest, breeds like crazy, low environmental impact, lean, less space n food requirements, in every corner of the globe, thus local not imported like coconut oil, olive oil, avocado which r the only clean veg based fats with decent omega 3-6-9 ratios.

If you have a chance one day walk across a freshly ploughed field, you'll find countless dead animals killed by the process. That's generally what the flocks of birds following the tractor are eating. Anyone using any petroleum based products are supporting an industry that has quite a reputation for causing death so all plastics are pretty much out. If they drive a car take a look at the front of it and count all the dead animals smashed against it. Vegans accuse non vegans of being speciesist yet they happily slaughter anything they like from the plant kingdom. Plants struggle to stay alive with more tenacity than any animal, so what are vegans saying, just because evolution didn't give them a brain it's ok to kill them? I could go on but how long should a comment be? Half of my extended family are evangelical vegans, the type that find themselves being arrested at protests so I am accustomed to having this discussion and whenever I raise these points they brush them aside as not relevant or the classic, we do what we can. Which is fine, we all do what we can but I'm not out there in the streets telling people to be like me. If they want to be vegan, all power to them, but when they try to take the moral high ground and tell people how wrong they are because they're not vegan I feel obliged to call them out for the hypocritical bullies they are. I hope my little diatribe helps clarify the point. Thanks for reading.	UCw2tEW81CdfpPaqqZVPj1KQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw2tEW81CdfpPaqqZVPj1KQ	1	UgydvJ5M5BY4lwDE_eV4AaABAg	Joe Jupiter

It's also a good way to fight climate change [and world hunger]. If you want to argue with that, don't argue with me. Argue with the climate expert in the video who won a Nobel Prize with the UN climate panel. And fighting climate change is much more than saving a few types of animals. It is saving any species that is threatened by climate change. "while totally ignoring the vast quantity of plants and animals that need to die in order for these same vegans to live" Vegans eat plants, vegans kill plants, people who eat meat eat fewer plants. Of course, that sounds bad for veganism. At least as long as you stop thinking there. The animals you eat don't just live of love and air alone. They have to eat too. And what do they eat? Plants. Plants you have to kill to feed them to the animals. Under the line, you have to grow and kill more plants if you feed them to animals first and then eat animal products than if you just grow plants to eat them directly. Not even people from the meat industry argue with that. And please don't start with that lie that livestock only eats byproducts from the soy oil production. I have a meat alternative in my kitchen right now which has high amounts of protein and is made from that byproduct. We don't need livestock to use soy 100%. Also if we wouldn't need food for livestock we wouldn't use that much soy for oil production. Sunflower and canola have a much higher amount of oil than soy. Around 80% of the soy yield ends up as food for livestock. So it makes more sense to say oil is a byproduct of the food production for livestock. So if you look at the complete cycle of food production vegans even cause fewer dead plants and not just fewer dead animals. "Veganism is a religion and no religion is based on logic" Yes, no religion is based on logic [or facts]. And that's why veganism is not a religion. It IS based on logic and facts. Just one reason why it's a good idea is that it's a good way to fight climate change. If you want to argue with that ... (see above) We have no prophet. We have no god. We base our world view on scientific information like what you see in this video. That has nothing to do with religion at all. "I'm happy for people to practice their religions. I'm not telling anyone to "be like me", that's what you're doing" And it would be a problem that I tell others what to do if the thing I'm asking them to would be a personal decision. Like being religious or not. Only you are affected by that decision so it's your personal decision. And that's simply just not the case with eating meat. It's a really simple fact that with every bit of meat someone eats someone else gets negatively affected by it. At least until we have actual lab-grown meat you don't need to kill animals for. That's why it's just not possible that eating meat or not is a personal decision. It always has a negative impact on others thus it's not personal. "be like me and judging them if they're not" I never judged anyone just for eating meat and never will do that. Not judging people but still telling them what they do is bad doesn't have to be a contradiction. Those are two different things. I ate meat for 26 years and I know what kind of person I was during that time. The problem was not that I was a bad person and didn't care, the problem was that I didn't really think about what I'm actually doing. We all grew up in a society where it's absolutely normal to eat meat. So we never questioned if eating meat still is legit when we also could live vegan. During our history, many people grew up in a society where something which we think is bad was completely normal. That doesn't mean all those people from the past were bad. You can do something bad without being a bad person.	UCZgE5M15uAgP46SO7M8NjkQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZgE5M15uAgP46SO7M8NjkQ	1	UgydvJ5M5BY4lwDE_eV4AaABAg	Joe Jupiter

When confronted with the fact they say things like, "well we do what we can", Veganism is a religion and no religion is based on logic so this is pretty much what you would expect .

I'm not telling anyone to "be like me", that's what you're doing and that's why I replied to your demand.

Do you only want to make some accusations without actual arguments to support them or do you want to look for a solution? And why does it even matter what some vegans do? This is not about people who are currently vegan. This is about going vegan or at least eating far less meat. And going vegan is not about starting to eat more avocado, it's about stopping to eat animal products. And I hope that in the comment section of this video we don't really have to talk about the fact that this would help the climate.

I just gave you five independent reasons specific to why CO2 is the cause of the warming. And you did little more in response than pretend I didn't, and proceed to parrot the tired and easily debunked talking points of the so-called "skeptics". Too bad. <<For a science discussion we need a start date.>> The start date for the anthropogenic warming trend is early to mid 20th century. <<1) Warming starts before mans co2. >> And what's your start date for that? <<2) tide gauges show no change with mans co2. >> Doesn't make sense, now you're talking about sea level rise? Tide gauge measurements agree with satellite measurements of sea level rise, which show an acceleration in recent years. And what's your start date for that? <<3) Ice cores show co2 lags warming'>> And I never said they don't, for the past. The fact that it lagged in the past is not proof that CO2 cannot also preceed and cause warming. It is a forcing and a feedback, both of which are shown by simple physical laws. There is no natural means by which CO2 could have risen in the past ~1 million years (you violated your own insistence on the start date again here -- don't worry, I helped you out) at regular intervals, *except* by a temperature rise. So of course CO2 rose first, in the past. Now, that humans have figured out how to extract and burn fossilized carbon on a global scale, the situation is obviously different. << 4) Science requires a start date. >> The start date for the anthropogenic warming trend is early to mid 20th century. <<5) Currently there is no warming.>> Complete lie.

(Happy to provide original sources from the scientific literature if you like.) 1. Nights are warming faster than days (consistent with a greenhouse effect induced warming). 2. The upper atmosphere is cooling as the troposphere warms (consistent with a greenhouse effect induced warming). 3. The radiative forcing of CO2 has been directly measured, at both the surface and from satellites. 4. There is no convincing evidence for a natural, alternative explanation for the warming (such an explanation would also need to explain 1-3). 5. You said "mans CO2" so I'm not sure if this means you suspect the rise in CO2 is causing the warming, but this rise is *not* the result of human activities? If so, well, there are numerous lines of evidence demonstrating the rise in CO2 is anthropogenic: C12/C13 ratio, the fact that no known natural source can account for it, geological records showing stable CO2 for thousands of years until the industrial revolution, and reasonably accurate estimates of global fossil fuel use and the expected resulting atmospheric concentration increase.

I am simply stating a fact: there is abundant evidence for warming, as well as for the fact that it is currently being driven by CO2. I am happy to share original sources, if you would be so kind to clarify first whether you disagree with the existence of warming, OR that CO2 is the causeof it.

Also here it is only greenhouse gas emmision but given my other points, for instance deforestation then all the land previously used for growing these sentients will be free again (for forest etc).

Yes it's more than transportation, but eliminating it would not stop warming. https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/styles/medium/public/2016-05/global_emissions_sector_2015.png And of course, this 24% would not simply drop to 0 even in a 100% global plant-based diet. The industrialized farming required to feed 7 or 8 billion will still have an impact, but yes it would be less if everyone were vegan. The moral and public health effects of an omnivorous diet are irrelevant to my point.

Air pollution of meat/poultry is more than all transports combined(plane, big boats, car, trucks etc) then you have fish and other related air pollution then you have deforestation and water pollution then you have many big public health problem(meat is unhealthy plus zoonose problems etc) then you have related socio-economical problems(poverty, slaughterhouse labor, etc) then you have philosophical problems(carnism is an obscurantism, ethics&logic, sexism/racism/speciesism&compassion/logic) etc. Carnism is linked with calitalism but you will also need politics to maintain and improve many things yes.

The planet would continue to warm just at a slightly slower pace, if everyone ate a purely plant based diet with transportation and electricity still predominantly powered by fossil fuels.
