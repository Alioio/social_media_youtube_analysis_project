Kim Jong Un is paranaoid about long term threats to his existence. Politicians are paranoid about holding power in their seat (constituent), so don't dare talk about overpopulation.

I don&#39;t hide who I am or what I believe in.<br />To comment here in response to that message.<br />Firstly, a positive action that would help in XR&#39;s cause. Refuse to pay the standing charge element on all your utility bills, energy, water, sewage. Only a few hundred people signed the two recent petition attempts to parliament to get this issue addressed. You use less, you pay less. Profligate abuse is then penalised with higher rates!<br />Secondly, XR can initiate a realistic and meaningful demand that the IPCC report is sent to every household, to share and start an informed conversation within every family.<br />Maybe XR aren&#39;t doing enough, too much like staging an event for choreographing a video of selfies and some questionable choice of clips to edit into an &#39;aware&#39; product for consumption. See if you can spot what I mean. Is this cameraMAN DBS registered?	UC_uYrnaurpBXyAzrULvonQA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_uYrnaurpBXyAzrULvonQA	0

Ugyr7TwyvPURZd3Aw6N4AaABAg	0	6	2020-03-16 23:59:24	Francis L Mayer	We need to realize this is a moral issue, otherwise it will never be addressed: <br /><br /><br />&quot;&quot;The fundamental criterion for an ecological ethic is not individualistic or commercial. It is deeply spiritual. For, the root of the environmental crisis lies in human greed and selfishness. What is asked of us is not greater technological skill, but deeper repentance for our wrongful and wasteful ways. What is demanded is a sense of sacrifice, which comes with cost but also brings about fulfillment. Only through such self-denial, through our willingness sometimes to forgo and to say “no” or “enough” will we rediscover our true human place in the universe.&quot; Quote from His All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew the “Green Patriarch” <br /><br /><br />These people are all coming to this issue decades late. The “Green Patriarch” who has held this title since 1996 and he has been working the issues at an international level since well before then. <br /><br /><br />Bottom line everyone needs to sacrifice to achieve carbon neutrality. This simply means saying enough is enough. We can all do with a little less and take steps to do better by focus in this being a moral issue, not a political one. Activism without sacrifice on each individual&#39;s part is hypocrisy.	UCny7gkRSEZxtIiR3h-Qbpyw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCny7gkRSEZxtIiR3h-Qbpyw	0

ER a nothing but a public nuisance that do nothing for their cause, they just piss people off, they do many illegal things like glue themselves to roads, block roads or entry to buildings, block bridges they cause business and people to lose money. There has been incidences of ambulances in emergency's needing to get to hospitals and being blocked or people trying to get to doctors etc, so if people havent already died because of them its only a matter f time until someone does. They are also agitators, but the problem is even though they are doing something illegal, if i get out of my car and rip then off the road they were stuck too so i can get past, i will be the one that will be in trouble with the law.

Stroud is also an incredibly expensive and posh place to live in the UK, you&#39;re definitely not poor and deciding whether you can afford to go to work that day if you live in Stroud.

First of all, what has someones wealth or standing got to do with whether or not they should protest or have concerns about the future of the planet? None. They don't tell people to not have children, not to eat, breath or live - it would help if you were to be realistic? There are options regarding travel, but I suppose some sacrifices will have to be made for a while where global travel is concerned, but people will have to ask where their morals are at for that portion, and whether they're selfish enough to sacrifice their kid's futures in exchange for a holiday to Miami. I'm a documentary photographer and former Royal Marine Commando. I've covered everything from the war in Syria, Civil uprising against the government in Santiago, Chile, anti-poaching teams in Kenya and Zimbabwe, Israeli and Palestinian conflict over the west bank and gaza strip (from both sides of the coin) and numerous other projects, I've had awards from Olympus, The Nikon Foundation, The Royal Photographic Society, among others. I have picked up skills of intuition over the years, and the one thing I noticed about Extinction Rebellion was the diversity of people involved. When I covered them during the London, Berlin and New York protests (I had to get around the world a lot for that few weeks) including the build up to all of their protests (about 14 months prior to the big events themselves), there were warehouse workers, carers, scientists, former police officers, students, firemen, doctors, nurses, mechanics, kitchen stewards, three British soldiers who went AWOL to do this, there were taxi drivers who had quite because they were worried, entrepreneurs, web designers, factory workers, assemblers...there were all sorts of people, from all walks of life there. If you have kids, based on what I learnt from the environmental scientists (at Cambridge, Oxford, Warwick, Portsmouth, Southampton and York unis during my time working on this documentary photography project) then I would be seriously worried about what those children will have to look forward to, even in 15 - 20 years.

Even the IPCC says that much. Actually Svante Arrhenius predicted in 1896 that average global temperatures would rise 1 degree C over the course of the 20th Century due to greenhouse gases, which they did. It&#39;s not complicated. He won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1903. Look him up. Or not. You can choose to learn or you can pretend it isn&#39;t happening.

We all have to change the way we live and become less dependent on energy but we're all hooked and cling to our convenient life styles and I don't see that changing. Government might force change on us eventually like rationing electricity, water, and enforce huge taxes on carbon related services/products. Governments have to accept the fact that the economy cannot grow forever without destroying the earth and must come to the reality of a slowdown or a long pause while we sort our shit out.

She also would need at least a 3 bedroom home/apartment. I bet feeds and clothes her kids too so there is more things that are not really good for the environment. A lot of the people in movements like this have very little contact with nature and have no idea what the are talking about. Notice how there no scientists at these things, but everyone they talked to said the science is out there to read. So why aren't the scientists out there protesting too?

If it cause mass unemployment, this would be the end of groups like XR because the population would turn on them in an instant.<br /><br />The reasons this matters, a part from the struggle to pay bills and put food on the table, people will start to notice that the kind of people pushing this are comfortable in their finances, they don&#39;t have to worry about where their next meal is coming from and this will cause divisions between the different classes and would push people further right because their dire circumstances would become a breeding ground for dodgy groups to exploit. We need to avoid a repeat of the miners strikes and everything that came after it.<br /><br />Change needs to happen gradually or the support you have will diminish if it effects negatively on peoples lives and they will turn against you.

Have you noticed a volcano spews more CO2 in an eruption then we could ever possibly put out as humans? Did you know the earth goes thru cycles? Right now we are at solar minimum. Did you know "climate change" is a myth was created to tax you for breathing by oligarchs that created the United Nations. Did you know in the 70s it was called global cooling? Then changes to global warming? Now it's just called climate change. Do some research before you spout talking points from the UN.

Human extinction would involve the reduction in population measured in billions, a few million in comparison is almost insignificant. Now, by twisting that into an accusation of belittling the haulocaust is a dubious device and not logical.For comparison, Israel would have to completely irradicate the palestinians about a thousand times to get close......The reality is they are only trying it once, is that belittling the irradication of the Palestinians?

More money than you can even comprehend apparently. And, it's not like you'll be saved while everyone else dies. Money don't protect you from climate change just like it don't protect you from the convid-19. Nature don't give a shit about your money. You'll die with us. And, the only reason we'll all die is because of your insatiable greed...	UCp5F3t60A9TIMFOteUJyXKg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp5F3t60A9TIMFOteUJyXKg	1	UgzpmE1__E453xBvqTx4AaABAg	G J
