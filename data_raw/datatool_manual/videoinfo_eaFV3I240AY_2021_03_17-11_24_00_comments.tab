If you work in oil and gas, recommend your employers buy in. Talk to the companies that supply your power, demand they buy in. If you own property, install solar power on your roof or wind power in your fields, use a little bit less, 40 watt bulbs instead of hundred watt bulbs, reduce, reuse and recycle, if you can make your next car one of the environmentally sound ones or choose public transportation when possible. Buy only natural fiber clothing that doesn't need a chemical plant to process it whenever possible. Demand your government fund energy improvements and get some clean energy maintenance jobs in your community. Use organic soaps instead of phosphates, limit your use of everything not recycle able. There's a list for people who aren't sure of positive actions to take.	UCQ4yzgr_cWD2k-4G-SHoHoQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ4yzgr_cWD2k-4G-SHoHoQ	1	UgwXfoMu5vCZUw0I59t4AaABAg	Kieran Doody

It’s likely not even statistically feasible and B. It is insanely and ridiculously fast as is several magnitudes greater than all time historically unprecedented rates of human production Additionally there are a lot of technical challenges accomplishing transitions like this that this climate movement are woefully unaware of and haven’t ever taken into consideration. You have these organizations calling for the highest levels of environmental restrictions and regulations yet at the same time forecasting unprecedented levels of installation rates. Environmental laws like NEPA or MPRS in the US do not apply only to the fossil fuel industry. If you want to build a geothermal plant, the construction and operation of that plant has to comply with your new environmental regulations. If you want to build an off shore wind farm you require federal permits to build these installations, and if you change the regulations to ridiculous standards that prevent construction of any kind or cause delay then it is impossible to meet the projected deadlines these organizations are calling for. Additionally, people really need to understand the energy industry a bit better. This idea that we can just produce random amounts of energy with no consequence or challenge is insanity. We need to plan out how much capacity we plan to produce and what penetration by source we plan to use in order to account for all challenges such as grid loading expectancy brought on by VRE penetration, which is a HUGE challenge that has yet to ever be identified by this movement EVER...

There are only so many fossils left to go around. Once all the oil wells and coal mines are dead, empty, and dry with nothing left to give, is NOT the time to start thinking about what we are going to do about alternative solutions. NOW is well past time to start getting those ducks in a row, while we are still able to heat our homes, light our lights, and fuel our cars without real trouble at the moment. But that will NOT last forever, and the alternatives will be easier to adjust to rather gradually, than overnight, with no choice. Besides, developing the technologies are and will continue to develop jobs and the educational programs which are geared to those advancing technologies. More educational programs and more technology related jobs which pay well are a really great way to move towards the future. And the future is coming, whether you are ready for it or not.

As "the younger generation" becomes the jaded, blinded "older generation," as per usual, the current younger generation is usually the one to speak up and tell the rest what they can see before clearer eyes, and what needs to be done to fix the problems. But, the older generations, generally responsible for the problems currently affecting the world, because they have been "at it" longer and working with older technology and thought processes, continue to get blinded and deafer to those issues, the voices get louder and the images get larger, but the actions also get more ineffective. This time, it can't come fast enough, or come bigger and louder enough to make people sit up and pay enough attention, because we are truly running out of time!

Also there is a solution when it comes to driving electric vehicles for instance you could very easily charge your car inside of your garage instead of driving to a gas station & use more gas emissions that are harmful for the environment which by the way it’s a lot cheaper to own an electric car than a car that uses gas especially when gas prices can be quite expensive.

We even had a hosepipe ban for my area during that time. I will admit I went on my bike a lot to exploit the nice days for exercise during that time. It’s currently Winter and apart from 1 moderate frost it’s still been above average for normal Winger temperature though it’s raining a lot like what’s typical of Winter	UC2hLEiK4M8vHgABRhoePvYg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2hLEiK4M8vHgABRhoePvYg	0

These are just a few of the things she talks about at her seminars. Instead of fighting and hating what one girl is try to do, you do the RESEARCH... and look it up yourself. Or is that to much for you? (Rhetorical question.) Paris climate Accord, wild life preservation and how it affects our existence, controlled population, respect for life on the planet (animal and human alike), respect for the planet (stop the littering). Literally reversing the damage we've done for the last decade! And that's just off the top of my head to name a few. Could probably go on.

She has publicly denounced the EUs plans for creating the worlds largest interconnected grid and developing net zero emissions by 2050, saying that this is too slow. Comments like that are INSANE.... Do you have any idea how crazy fast that is to upgrade, install and expand technology on a grid network measuring in at 2.2 million sq miles! That’s like building 6,000 miles of heavy civil infrastructure every single month. That is ridiculously fast. You have people in the US that think you can just transition a massive industry with a light switch. That’s not how it works. We coordinated planning and effective solution to implement. I don’t care how many jobs you plan to have when in reality that doesn’t mean anything and what really matters is determining that we have enough installed capacity to meet projected consumption.

No. Ironically your solar panels and wind turbines literally contain petrochemicals, so it would be completely counterproductive to eliminate all fossil fuels thereby reducing production power for renewables. We fundamentally don’t have substitutes for literally thousands of petrochemical products and processes. This will take time, so calling for a moratorium on all fossil fuels immediately is completely ridiculous. Yes we need to reduce emissions as much as possible and as a fast possible BUT we also have to make this transition in such a way that society can still function during the transition.

If she really wants to make a difference, and she has the intelligence, then she should concentrate her education on science and attempt to discover the means for people to live the lives we have developed to without harming the environment. There is so much positive research going into this and her continually negative voice is becoming tiresome. People don&#39;t want to hear that we must revert to the stone-age to save our planet they want the good scientific developments that will make that unnecessary.

Yeah.....😒 And because of "my rude comment" you refuse to DO ANY research on the subject? Because of me? Really? Yeah - maybe you better rethink that juvenile attitude. You're not hurting ME with that spin - I don't change my life because of comments on YouTube. You're only denying and hurting yourself.

Just for your rude comment, I don’t even think I shall this evening either. I do research on topics that I don’t understand and would like to know better but generally don’t get the answers to my questions 🙁. For example, I have four questions about the COVID vaccine that nobody has yet to answer.

Kind of like actually opening up a book?? Afraid you might actually LEARN something? That's the attitude and thought process with which those who are the problem instead of the solution operate every day. Then you, my friend, are part of the bigger problem, instead of the necessary solution. Try doing a bit of research and learn something about what's actually going on in the world, or does that disturb your pat narrative too much, make you too uncomfortable, and wreck the pointless rhetoric in which you actually believe and operate?

One solution to over population is restricting the number of kids people can have and who can have kids. I know people will say that goes against their rights but to be honest maybe freedom only works for smart people who can make the right choice and we all know the world is full of stupid people that pop out kids on the regular and increase the population by unnecessary proportions	UCb8Zxhr10fSnrsyDzyXbEJA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb8Zxhr10fSnrsyDzyXbEJA	0
