title	ESA and climate change
description	Climate change is high on the global agenda. To tackle climate change, a global perspective is needed and this can be provided by satellites. Their data is key if we want to prepare ourselves for the consequences of climate change. While our Earth Explorers gather data to understand how our planet works and understand the impact that climate change and human activity are having on the planet, the European Union’s Copernicus Sentinels provide systematic data for environmental services that help adapt to and mitigate change. The video offers an overview of how European satellites keep watch over our world. It includes interviews with Josef Aschbacher, our Director of Earth Observation Programmes, and Michael Rast, our Earth Observation Senior Advisor. ★ Subscribe: http://bit.ly/ESAsubscribe and click twice on the bell button to receive our notifications.
