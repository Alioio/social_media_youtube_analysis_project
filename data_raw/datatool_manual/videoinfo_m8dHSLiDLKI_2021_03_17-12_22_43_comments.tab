Solar panels and Wind mills provide, what 10% of all energy in the US and cover vast amounts of space. This is not effective nor desirable. High Nuclear power costs are unnecessary and imposed via environmental bureaucracies, blockage, suits etc...If we want a rapid decrease in Carbon by products, then Nukes are the way to go. Creating jobs is not part of the picture and should not be. People who believe millions of jobs will be the result of building solar and wind, are living in a utopia, all things remaining equal.

Also, the land needed for both forms is insane and completely impractical. Wind and solar also destroy large numbers of birds and habitat. And obviously these forms are massively subsidized by the govt. I don't see any realistic future for wind and solar.

Germany has already discovered this fact despite all of their efforts and massive subsidies. Also, the market could not bear the cost. The price of energy would be exorbitant, as it is in Germany and the US would not take it. Further, the rest of the non advanced world would simply be priced out of the game and relegated to stagnation. No, we need fossil fuels for the foreseeable future.

This is easy to prove mathematically because the greenhouse gas response to CO2 is logarithmic, and a change from 190 to 280ppm is ony 0.9 degC, while the change in average Earth temperature between glacial and interglacial periods is about 7 degC.

However, no solution will work without transitioning to a non-fossil global economy. But just to talk about ONE solution: if you position several satellites with large solar blankets at the L1 point (the point at which Earths gravity and the Suns gravity exactly cancel), then they can be positioned to reduce solar insolation on Earth&#39;s poles by maybe 10-30%. This has the subtle and temporary effect of cooling the Poles, reducing the threat of sea level rise, permafrost outgassing, and AMOC shutdown.

NASA has been taking heat from its own retired members as a result of the self generated hysteria and many in the science have dropped out and now oppose the ipcc's efforts. there are also many court cases springing from data hording and data tampering.

So although a shade sounds like a good solution, it's like shading an oven that's still cooking.

The climate changes and has without human influence for as long as we could possibly know. The main factor of climate change is not CO2 but in fact solar cycles and orbital differences. CO2 is mearly an after thought that is one single factor out of many and ill prove it. The Milankovitch cycles over a much longer period than any graph here or that is ever shown in any pro CO2 politically driven climate change discussion. This shows that the earth has been much warmer in the past and CO2 was allmost as high as it is today. Climate change is not driven by CO2. It's driven by solar cycles and orbital differences. Most of what drives every system on earth is driven by factors off the planet,not on it. Tectonic plate movements,volcanic activity,magma flow etc.. are driven by the magnetic field and muons. Jet streams,hurricanes and typhoons, electrical storms,general weather,cloud nucleation etc... are mainly driven by solar wind,photons and positively charged ions. Even the oceans tides are mainly driven by the moon. The fact is the entire solar system has been heating up and if you do not know this then you're only basing your decision on what happens on earth from one single smaller factor in CO2.

At the L1 point they would not have to be large (versus at GEO) to reflect substantial quantities of solar energy away from Earth's poles. This is because they are that much closer to the Sun and the mass relationship is the area relationship: r2. However, this could require stationkeeping abilities beyond current technology. I think for the L1 point its worth looking into: what would be required to make a difference? For GEO or LEO, I agree: it would be absurd: too far from the Sun means too much sunshade material needed. Battling global warming is often talked about in 'wedges': space mirrors at the L1 point could potentially be one 'wedge' of solution: it doesn't have to be the whole pie.

Sure, it sounds simple at first. But when you consider that modern rockets use about 90% of their mass as fuel that person would be proposing burning 9 cubic kilometers of fuel for every 1 cubic kilometer of water to solve the problems caused by fuel burning..(actually it would be a lot more since that 90% figure is just to get to LEO) They would never get that amount of energy in the first place and even if they did the resulting environmental consequences of this proposed solution would make the original environmental problem seem miniscule by comparison. Not that this is the only problem with that idea.	UC2evxxtCrzLzrSLFXRb0tbQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2evxxtCrzLzrSLFXRb0tbQ	1	Ugy9OZs-MEKWA-FE-Md4AaABAg	midbrew

If you translate this into energy using simple back of the envelope calculations using highschool physics formulas you get: 1/2 mv^2. 1 half times mass of the object you want to lift into space times velocity squared or 7000 meters per second squared, you won't have enough energy to lift anything that could significantly block the sun from orbit even if you use all the energy produced in the world. Just lifting a 100 kilogram person into space requires something like 2000 mega joules of energy. Getting something into geostationary orbit in specific Lagrange points in high Earth orbit would require even more energy. It's just not a feasible solution. You'll have more luck and be more effective if you just paint large portions of the Earth white not that it would really matter in the long term. The problem of global warming is unsolvable given our present technology levels since it requires sequestering billions of tons of CO2 and other GHGs from the atmosphere. Do you know how much billions of tons is? It's not an amount that could be removed from the atmosphere and effectively stored using any known available technology.

If something goes wrong, its a total loss. The ISS is 'different' and we have the bill to prove it. Remember when they fixed the Hubble? For what that cost, they could have just launched another Hubble. We're talking about a Constellation of space mirrors, not a single satellite. Say: 60. If one of them goes rogue, let it. That goes for whether its at the L1 or in LEO. It'll cost you the same, either way, if you make the expensive choice and try to repair it.

If they are anywhere outside Earths gravity well, they are just as difficult to 'modify/dismantle' as anywhere else (i.e. distance doesn't matter: gravity does). Being at the L1 pt minimizes stationkeeping fuel usage (read: longevity. read: lower cost). The positioning has to be extremely precise, but I believe not beyond current technology. And even if they aren't perfectly positioned, all you care about is their 'statistical average' position, since any one 'space mirror' satellite is not large enough to shade Earth significantly from the L1 position.

Look at it this way, at night, unless a warm front moves in, it will always cool down no matter where on earth you are. This is because the sun is not shining. It is that simple. Remove the heat source and the area cools. Hopefully you now understand why claiming co2 warms the planet is totally absurd. Science requires precision not folly.

CO2 lags warming at vostok station: reason being its in Antarctica, which is practically not even on Earth. Efforts to understand the GLOBAL temperature response to CO2 as we transitioned from the last ice age confirm what we'd expect from Physics from 1860 on: temperature LAGS CO2. (Coming out of a glacial period: Antarctica warms from orbital perturbations. So does the Arctic. Eventually, this shuts down the AMOC, which warms the Southern Ocean, which outgasses CO2, and THAT warms the planet, about 800 years after Antarctica started warming due to purely orbital effects).

It doesn't matter why we both agree he was silly so what's your gripe. Scaring the kids would not be his dancing, but the profits of doom about the planet heating up. Unless you think that wouldn't frighten children? If billionaires were not greedy I agree we would all be better off. But you said the electric would not be twice as much. Twice as much as when? Because if it was all on renewable without subsidy and having to cover all its own overheads, it most certainly would be.

Electric energy is not twice as much, and everyone could easily have electric if billionaires stopped hogging money. This is a kids video, that's why he was being silly.

If CO2 concentrations are doubled, it allows for 4x the amount of water vapour to be present in the air. This increase the heat absorption proportionally by about 20x thanks to the increase of water vapour However, if CO2 levels are reduced, the amount of atmospheric water vapour decreases exponentially (and with it, the increase of absorption and therefore global warming.) A quick google search will yield you with far more understandable and detailed explantations, but that’s the long and short of it. TLDR: High levels of atmospheric water vapour is a product of global warming, not the cause of it.

Ugxwzb2ixzs3mqP5xP14AaABAg	1	1	2018-12-22 10:59:24	Bud Blumenthal	I agree with everything he says except for an error at around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8dHSLiDLKI&amp;t=13m23s">13:23</a> when he states that hunter gatherer mankind drives the wooly mammoth to extinction. That&#39;s just wrong. He was certainly taught that in school as was I, but we know that mankind in hunter gatherer configuration doesn&#39;t exploit animals to the point of extinction. That&#39;s a modern man thing. No the mammoths and all of the mega fauna that went extinct around the globe and the Clovis civilisation in America for example, were wiped out by a catastrophic astrological/geological event in the form of a meteor or comet collision that occurred 12600 years ago in the North American ice sheet and at least in the Greenland Ice sheet. This is well documented now with even very recent discovery of the impact crater under the ice in Greenland. It was cataclysmic. The mega fauna were not hunted out but perished along with most of humanity at the beginning of the Younger Dryass.

Driving carefully, my hybrid gets between 40 and 60 miles per gallon. Already agreed upon by manufacturers, there was going to be a stipulation to make 55 mpg standard on autos in 8 years, but our toxic Pres.Nit-wit overturned that. Also, if you&#39;re headed out to the steakhouse in your Silverado, and believe in facts, consider that 18% of global warming is generated from cows, including methane. Bon Appetit.
