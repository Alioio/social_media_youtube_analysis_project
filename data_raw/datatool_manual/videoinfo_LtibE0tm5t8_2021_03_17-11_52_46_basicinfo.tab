title	Polar Bears & Climate Change
description	A mini documentary film by Yorkshire Wildlife Park Foundation & Polar Bears International about the devastating effects man-made climate change is having on Polar Bears and our our planets environment. We discover it's not too late to help stop a climate catastrophe if we all play our part. See www.YWPFoundation.com for ideas of how you can help. This includes signing up to our 18 degrees C or below campaign. This initiative will help you save money on your utility bills and protect Polar bears in the wild. Yorkshire Wildlife Park Foundation supports the vital work of Polar Bears International by protecting the arctic sea ice habitat polar bears rely on to survive.
