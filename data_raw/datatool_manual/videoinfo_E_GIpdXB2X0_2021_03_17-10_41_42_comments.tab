You do understand that the cause of calving is because of ice GROWTH. Not ice loss. When ice melts, it turns into rivers of water. When ice grows it expands until it breaks off and calves.

UgyfIIwnqg5xK2mfoWp4AaABAg	6	6	2020-03-01 18:03:00	Jarago Mardagoon	Fear-mongering that gives no hope and only makes people no longer care because &quot;we can&#39;t do anything&quot; life will go on with or without human interaction. This points blame at everything else other than YOU, YOURSELF. It&#39;s because of all of us that we are in this situation, because we all are lazy and don&#39;t care no matter how much we cry about it. If you are reading this it&#39;s because you yourself are a part of the problem. Electricity isn&#39;t fully green yet, most everything we use every day isn&#39;t green. Want to live more green? Take a walk in the forest without taking pictures of it for social media, ditch your car and set up a tent and live there without any modern comforts that will generate co2 or any other green house emissions... Even then you will still be a part of the problem breathing alone. No matter how you look at it some form of fear-mongering can still be made about this. Best we can do is stop freaking out about something that isn&#39;t here yet and work on the here and now. If nothing can be done then live the last of what is still good in peace vs wish you would have spent more time doing something more than cry about the worst of it before it&#39;s no longer here to enjoy and you&#39;re in the hell you worried about missing life from the start. Humans have a way of survival, we get things done when we absolutely have to take care of it because we are lazy. We WILL throw this planet into hell and we are capable of bringing it back to the wonderful place it once was. This is how we as humans have always been, this is another lesson of life we must go through because we helped do this. This is how we as humans grow, it&#39;s a part of life. If we don&#39;t make it through this then we will all die and that&#39;s just the end to our story because the human race wasn&#39;t good enough to be in this universe due to our own faults and lack of understanding. Something else will take our place as we did with all other life that passed before us. It&#39;s stupid to worry about things that can kill us all. IT WILL HAPPEN AT SOME POINT OF TIME. Just live in the moment that we are all still here and keep hope for the best and try to be happy with everything you do. Blaming a government you live under and pay for won&#39;t help anyone. It&#39;s just a childish way of pointing a finger at something when you have three more pointing right back at yourself. This world is becoming toxic because we all are toxic in some form of way. Holding up a sign for awareness and criticizing people for their faults just shows how much responsibility people don&#39;t want to own up to and would rather put it elsewhere. Want to hold up a sign for awareness? Great, don&#39;t disrupt the functionality of what we already have going, putting a small halt in anything will only cause more work to have it fixed because of it. Go pick up trash and be humble about it. Don&#39;t use paper to make others feel bad like you are better than anyone else. Use your words vs factory made items to show expression. Be the change this world needs, not the one it already has that isn&#39;t working. Be yourself and love what we have as we have it. Take care of what we have as we have it. No one likes a boss figure who points fingers. People love leaders to follow and to learn what drives them to become a leader for themselves. If we are all doomed, then let&#39;s go out with a bang and celebrate the life we still have. It&#39;s better than living in fear of something that will happen at some point in time.

If I'm wrong about something then speak up. Otherwise you're just as much of a fool as he is. The only way you would make a fool of me by his statement is by providing proof I was wrong about what I said and that it was stupid about the things I said because I was completely wrong.

The main reason this is happening is due to developed countries currently who need cheap energy source as well as developed countries who don‚Äôt need as much but would still rather waste less money on energy source. As soon as one method becomes more cost efficient it will shift to that. But we have to let developing countries develop as fast as they can and that is done by giving them the cheapest means to do so, sadly that is fossil fuels. Not our fault our planet is so abundant in it & that we wanted to evolved a little.	UCJ6GVh8ISIOo1Oij2aXsHLQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ6GVh8ISIOo1Oij2aXsHLQ	1	UgwHsqaxpGBNOzHGmuB4AaABAg	NabiL

Coronavirus mortality rate is about 1-3%, margin of error included, flu is <1% , & SARS ~ 10%, MERS ~ 34%. So look do I think it is a concern, of course but I don‚Äôt think people should be going crazy with it. Of course a lot of people will die because it is easily transmissible & with even a small mortality rate times a huge population. Millions could die, but millions die every year from a variety of other diseases in viruses. This just happens to be a new one that we‚Äôre doing our best to handle.

Along with the temperature changes the mountain snow cover will further decrease. Rainfall has become more erratic and has declined by 3-30% in different regions. Sure you may have had days where it could reach 30 celsius but it is not the overwhelmingly average of temperatures. I didn‚Äôt say there aren‚Äôt effects I said the effects wouldn‚Äôt be detrimental to us as humans meaning we will be able to survive no matter what. Look there is no way to remove CO2 directly from the atmosphere eventually they‚Äôll reduce if we gradually transition. But you can‚Äôt expect countries like China or India to be doing that anytime soon. We have to let them develop as soon as they can so they can get out of their industrial revolution & we can have less carbon emissions in the long term	UCJ6GVh8ISIOo1Oij2aXsHLQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ6GVh8ISIOo1Oij2aXsHLQ	1	UgwHsqaxpGBNOzHGmuB4AaABAg	NabiL

That is why they said they killed many ar the base they attacked which was virtually empty. They saved face in front of their people & moved on. No sorry it would not have been a world war nor anything like vietnam. As for the novel coronavirus. Yes people will die just like people die every year of the actual flu. Am I saying we shouldn‚Äôt be more careful? Of course not but the virus itself isn‚Äôt very lethal with regards to ebola, sars, or the spanish influenza. Should it worry people? Definitely as it is a new virus that spread very quickly. However the majority of people who will die have underlying health conditions due to old age whose defenses can‚Äôt combat diseases as well as younger people. And before you call me a climate denier or anything of the sort, I do believe climate change is real & that things should be done to remedy it. However, I hope you also know that the effects of rising average global temperatures does not have a detrimental effect on us as humans but rather flora & fauna that can‚Äôt as readily adapt to slight changes in their environment.

Summers are no hotter today than they were when I was a kid in the fifies. If anything, the summers seem to me to be slightly cooler than back then. The winters seem a bit warmer lately but temps still drop to minus 20 or lower in Northern Ontario where I live, with lots of snow. The low temperatures are caused by cold Arctic air falling down into the south, so if the Arctic air is that cold when it gets this far south, imagine how cold it was when it left the Arctic. Probably minus 40 or -50 or -70, and the ice sheets don't melt when the air is that cold, so they are lying to us, who never go and see for ourselves, if the ice sheets are melting or not. The entire global-warming religion is scare-mongering by communists wanting to enslave us and take our wealth. Gubberments are the problem, not the solution. The more you ask from your gubberment, the more they will ask back from you. This whole global-warming thing is another false god designed to enslave you. I'll prove it. Think of the hottest place on earth that you can imagine. At or near the equator most likely. Death Valley in California is pretty hot but that is mostly because it is desert and below sea level and in kind of a bowl. Around 130 or more degrees Farenheit. The record was around 145 degrees F in or about 1949. Not much life there except lizards, rattlesnakes, scorpions, and Hila Monsters. But where do most people go on their vacations? They go south to the equatorial regions like the Caribbean and Hawaii, and some folks even live there year round, and nobody is burning up, like the global-warmers would preach to you. In fact, most of the snowbirds love the heat, so they love global-warming. Global-warming happens every summer but on the equator, it's always summer. Myself, I like cold and blizzardy winters, so ironically it is me who dislikes these last few warm winters. But the global-warmers measure the temperatures getting hotter and take many pictures of melting ice, as summer approaches but if you ask any Hawaiian if the temperatures are hotter, they will just tell you it's always hot here. Global-warming is aimed at retards. Smart people don't buy this horse-pucky. Thankfully Donald Trump saw thru it and pulled out of the stupid Paris global-warming scam. He knows exactly how the communists think and act. Don't be stupid! Global-warming is a scam!

There was no need for them to do anything for the climate with money we were suppose to give. In addition the way the paris accord was set up, they could continue to demand unlimited amount of money and we would have no choice as long as we remained it in. That means tax payers were paying taxes without representation. In case you didnt know, we fought a war of independence on that very issue.

Do you not see how having electricity in places that have never had it before is beneficial? Climate Change has an escribed religious dogma, the same way christians wait for the return of christ, i could be 50 years old, 30 years from now and maybe everything will be fine. Then the goal posts will move another 30 years. That's the way these things work. I'd try to not get too absorbed in it, because if it is deadly, we're already fucked, and if it isn't deadly then we can breathe a breath of fresh air. Literally the air is cleaner in a lot of places than it was 30/40 years ago and air pollution is the biggest enviromental killer.

I mean enough efforts, but not on a scale resulting in solutions. We did not provide extra CO2 captivity till this day. The opposite is true : look at the deforestation of the amazon forest and prognoses. We need microcultures, and in the same time, the road infrastructure is expanding around the city where i live (antwerp, belgium, new project started in 2019). Public manifests and organisations had to fight for years to make the expansions underground and not above ground to reduce air pollution... and the canal (Albertkanaal) is now enlarged (project started in 2019). In the meantime : the green energy production fails to be important enough. Even an increase X (%) of green energy production still means nothing if the total increase of energy Y % is bigger then X. There is no absolute reduction in the burning of biomasse on a global scale, .. again : the opposite is true. How long can we still be optimistic ? Also our system is wrong : we need to take away ecology from politics, but the rigid structure of our global society obstructs that possibility. The chance is real that the fight against global change is already too late or just impossible within the structures we live in.. But then again : did we really fight ??

I'm 43yrs old and I remember Christmas, it was always so cold I couldnt go outside and play with my toys. I remember wearing a jacket on Halloween. I live 20 miles from where I grew up and we might have a total of 10 days of really cold weather. I remember never seeing snow growing up and wondering what it would be like to build a snowman. Well in 2009 we had 8 inches of snow. It doesnt matter if any of us believe in global warming or not. All I can tell you is what I've experienced in just my lifetime. I know that the summers are getting hotter and winter isnt lasting like when I was a kid. Maybe its just my area where I live, no it's happening everywhere in the world. Look at all the glaciers that have melted. Some of them are straight up gone. Venus is a great example on what will happen to earth if it keeps on heating up. I have always kept an open mind. Even in religion. I quit goibg to church when the preacher said that if I dont believe in what he believed in, I was going to go to hell. All I know is that I belive in God and I feel that if I live my life to the fullest and pray to him, then he will understand why I dont go to church. Anyway just monitor where you live for a couple years and if I'm wrong, then you wasted your time. If I'm right and you see a change from when you grew up to now. Then you will see where I'm coming from. I just feel bad for my kids and grand kids. Have a great night and don't bash me to bad. Its just my opinion just like you having your opinion. I won't ever bash anyone for their opinions. I'm just not like that. Good night.

Again, provide a paper that provides the scientific evidence CO2 is the primary cause of 1) warming of our convective troposphere with an empirical observation/experiment and 2) more intense hurricanes. Correlations and models aren't hard scientific proof of causation. You've provided only blabbing about what you believe is fact. There has been a stronger Atlantic storm than Dorian btw (Allen 1980) and as far as wind intensity, Dorian matched the Labor Day hurricane of 1935, Gilbert 1988, and Wilma 2005.

The only reason are CO2 emissions have declined is because we have moved all of our production to china and now they are the number one emitters because of us and our insanely demanding consumer culture. Outsourcing our production doesn't get us off the hook for being a culture that causes insane CO2 emissions (if you took a basic economics class you would already know what "supply' and 'demand' means, but if you don't I can explain it to you). China is the leader in emissions because they now produce most of our stuff. This is the main reason our emissions have went down. Do your research bud.

We can estimate temperature way further back than a few hundred years. Look up how ice cores are used. The frequencies of natural disasters is a lie, the intense events are going up. We just had the first ever category 6 Hurricane Dorian. Australia is seeing some of the biggest wildfires in human history with millions of acres burned. It‚Äôs not just ‚Äòmore stuff‚Äô that is a pretty irrational explanation. Climate change is like steroids, it doesn‚Äôt cause natural disasters like steroids don‚Äôt build the muscle for you, but it intensifies lots of different natural disasters and makes them way more deadly intense and sets the conditions to occur more frequently.

We just don&#39;t have the time to do anything else anymore. The other thing is to really.. <i>really</i> ..take a look at ourselves and decide what we love more: our cars or our children.<br />For myself, I took that hard look about five years ago, and got rid of the car (bought a bicycle instead), I use and advocate for public transport. I downsized my living space and my life in general. I make a point of re-using/re-purposing/re-cycling. And among many other things, I eat a plant-based diet. Now, as a single woman I have a lot of leeway. Life looks a lot different for...let&#39;s say...a married woman with children...but the thing is to do <i>all that we can do</i> within our means to do so!<br />Because what we do individually might be just a drop in the bucket...but <b>that</b> is how the bucket gets filled.

Plants generally thrive in higher co2 conditions triple or quadruple this in some instances, as we increase our co2 emissions, would plants in return grow bigger faster and convert them into carbs and fibres also faster in response, and if that‚Äôs the case wouldn‚Äôt all w have to so is level out our emissions, we would be fine? I feel like carbon emissions is a little over rated and as long as we level out our emissions at some point, we would be fine. Perhaps planting more trees and stopping people intentionally burning down rainforests would be the best strategy against climate change.

Pretty simple really, but its not a plausible world ending scenario, you can‚Äôt just look at little sections of data and extrapolate and expect to get good data that way. If methane is the real problem then best thing to do is to somehow trap that melting methane, and convert it back to co2. Here‚Äôs an idea how about you build giant green houses in the north cover a good portion of the area with gas trapping blankets, direct the gas to heaters that turn the methane into co2 which would be pumped into the greenhouses, and converted directly into carbohydrates. Use that to feed a large portion of the world.	UCEcOiFK33gaEgjt8l3WPyzg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEcOiFK33gaEgjt8l3WPyzg	1	Ugy-AyFeExx6GoNSKtx4AaABAg	Gabor .R

We could technically dump a bunch more co2 in the atmosphere and plants would probably just fine, and we co2 rises so does plants ability to absorb and tolerate heat. Humans can tolerate more than 5 times the co2 levels safely, most animals can as well. You might have a slight problem with the slight acidification of oceans it probably wouldn‚Äôt be good. But co2 just degasses the world isn‚Äôt hitting a tipping point in 12 years. I don‚Äôt know what their motivation is, I personally think it‚Äôs climate science trying to stay more relevant, which I don‚Äôt think is necessarily a bad thing, but were no where near global destruction in the next century. There‚Äôs no reason to think that in the next 100 years or so we‚Äôd be able to level our emissions. If China and India cut emissions by half we‚Äôd be back to 1990s co2 levels very shortly.

Which would have to be voted on by at least 66% of it's constituents? No one's up for further debt on what the country is not even 2% responsible for and is leading the world in reducing in. You kids who support Bernie really need to take off the "free, free, free" blinders and truly not only read up what he stands for, but also the consequences and sheer unrealistic logistics it would take and keep pace of what he wants to institute. Not saying you specifically, but It's unbelievable how truly ignorant people are on whose basically dictating their future home. Read a damn book people!

And remember when climate change was called global warming and Al Gore predicted we&#39;d lose miles of coastline by now?

Obviously certain weather patterns are significantly different from how they were even decades ago, and it's only rapidly growing at a rate that does coincide with the rise and prominence of human ingenuity. The problem with climate change enthusiasts is that they blantantly ignore where the problem begins and the obstacles it would take to solve that problem that have ALMOST nothing to do with what they're protesting, which also hypocritically contradicts things they are partisan on when it comes to party lines, while also rejecting prompted solutions that also goes against partisan lines. And also the constant fear mongering (like this video) and over exaggeration on actual real statistics doesn't help. It gives off the perception of an agenda that uses climate change as a front just to actually initiate other denied or otherwise skeptical proposals (Ie: the Green New Deal). From a politician point of view.	UCL64YmBLYldK2h2E_hrIL6A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL64YmBLYldK2h2E_hrIL6A	1	UgwhGaEONUCPJ7duUVl4AaABAg	R JH
