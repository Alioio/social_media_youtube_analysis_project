The first thing: you can be sure that there is a lot of resistance and struggle within Brazil to try to stop the devastation of our Amazon Forest. However, when it comes to social struggles, there is no balance between the social struggle and the economic yearnings. Do you know why deforestation is growing in the Amazon? A simple thing called the agricultural frontier (Google it) that destroys any ecosystem for the formation of soy monoculture latifundios (and other foodstuffs). After all, Brazil is an agro-exporting country. WE CANNOT PROTECT OUR FORESTS WITH FOREIGN INCENTIVES TO DESTROY IT. Do you want to see the Amazon standing up? Great, so do we. However, join this fight with us and really help us. Through science, create a more sustainable model so that we can enjoy the improvement of our lands. There is no point in criticizing and continuing to finance mass deforestation.	UCK9oChjxm315VjIWBugdptQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK9oChjxm315VjIWBugdptQ	0

Could you answer me who are Chico Mendes and the institution that bears his name? Do you know what are the Brazilian environmentalist social movements? Do you know how to classify Brazilian biomes and their basic characteristics? Or do you think that Brazil is 100% Amazon rainforest? How many percent do we have of the Amazon and how much of it is preserved? Get out of your ignorance. In addition to being stupid, your comment is extremely offensive. There are MANY Brazilians who are fighting and dying for our exuberant nature. The Brazilian people are NOT the government, which for lack of argument places environmentalists (part of the population that fights for the Amazon, for the cerrado, for the caatinga, for the pampas, etc.) as political enemies that conspire against the economic development.

He also signed the First Step Act (Helped pardon or decrease the sentence of forgotten proven innocent black americans) and the Music Modernization Act (had various lesser known musicians, ESPECIALLY black musicians get more stability with payment from streaming services). Regarding economy: He decreased unemployment to record lows prior to the pandemic, made various tax cuts, and created millions of new jobs throughout his presidency. The average household income also increased a lot. Regarding foreign relations: Trump has made extremely successful trade deals with pretty much all of the world except china, which was in process of getting better prior to the pandemic. A notable successful trade deal was with Canada and Mexico, which pressured Mexico more into having better worker‚Äôs rights. With North Korea, they used to be hermits until Trump managed historical communication with them, which actually turned positive relatively quickly. With the Middle East, Trump also managed to host various VERY successful peace deals between muslim countries and Israel, which prior to trump‚Äôs presidency, was unheard of. He even got recommended for a nobel peace prize from that stuff. Trump has also started 0000000 wars. None at all. Additionally, Brazil and USA‚Äôs alliance has never been stronger, while Biden threatened to put economic sanctions on Brazil (the french president has also presented completely stupid ideas that Biden might likely agree with: internationalizing the Amazon).

ODay It works that way because when you disrupt the cycles of the environment- say burning down thousands of acres of trees- you also disturb the animal life. The animals that survive ( it's estimated Australia lost 1B animals in their fires last year) move into new territory for food & shelter. They carry with them the viruses & diseases which normally keep the species in stasis. In the new environment the viruses & diseases encounter new species that are susceptible. And thus new ailments wipe out whole civilizations. Europeans wiped out whole segments of Native American populations with the gift of blankets. Blankets that carried diseases unknown to the local community.	UC2Sn07-antp35gxRYHaG-Bw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2Sn07-antp35gxRYHaG-Bw	1	UgyfuNroi27M4CVOfyR4AaABAg	Michael Gibb

ODay Deforestation destroys the habitat of an animal such as bats, causing them to find roost somewhere else that seems them in close proximity to human infrastructure, e.g. a pig farm. They accidentally drop fruit they're eating, which is consumed by the pigs, and from there the virus is transmitted to humans. It's happened before. By the way, it's only called a respiratory virus because that's the sort of symptom the virus causes in humans. Coronaviruses for example, don't have the same affect on bats or other species, as they do on humans.

Brazil is the country that most protects its original forests including Amazon. Brazilian Army has specific bases locally designed to protect and monitor the Forest, within strong technology monitoring. NGO¬¥s financed by countries with other hidden interests, uses local indigenist people under the ‚Äúvoice to minority‚Äù speech to overcome Brazilian sovereignty, showing their imperialistic desires forcing that almost 50% of Brazil¬¥s territory is marked as indigenist reserves to &quot;achieve their desires&quot; under a different speech. Worst of all is the fake scientific fact, once world‚Äôs oxygen is produced by seaweeds, not plants and trees. Any person with basic understanding on biology knows that trees and plants produces oxygen during the day, but CO2 at night through Photosynthesis. Vast majority of Brazil energy matrix is clean trough Hydro DAM¬¥s. ‚ÄúTruth will set you free‚Äù.	UCxHVA1jeZRvvK-IMJuC1IYw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxHVA1jeZRvvK-IMJuC1IYw	0

Yes, they should protect it. But other countries also need to take the SAME responsibility within their boarders. We can't expect Brazil to sacrifice infrastructure and development while the rest of us aren't willing to do that in our own countries. Do you think NY was always as it is? No, it was once a luscious wilderness teaming with wildlife and beauty.	UCWJyPMNRIbCNpyXE-6AWduw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWJyPMNRIbCNpyXE-6AWduw	1	Ugx6xE3vxmbwKCmU2y94AaABAg	Hey Hey Hey

(the majority of it is anyway) I agree with you in general, but it's up to Brazilians to protect their own land and resources. But the onus is even more on them considering the fact that the rainforest is important for the whole globe.
