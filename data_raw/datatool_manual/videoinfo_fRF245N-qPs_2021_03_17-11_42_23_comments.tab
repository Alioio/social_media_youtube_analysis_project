It‚Äôs easier to say to yourself and others that it‚Äôs dead, bc then you don‚Äôt have to do anything. You can sit around, telling others how awful it all is without any sense of personal responsibility. It‚Äôs on each of us. This is our home and it‚Äôs not dead. Extraordinarily beautiful thing come up out of the Earth, beautiful beings are born every day and build a construct through which each one lives a life. Some really short by our perspective, some quite long. Everything is alive. Its a beautiful world.

Another reason for the term Climate Change is that the climate is changing by rates of change or by derivatives. Accelerating, the already documented acceleration, another potential reason why scientist may have estimates on the low side. As one of my EE profs. once said, uncontrolled positive feedback loops equal death, a funny anecdote, but a very serious problem. Thanks for highlighting it!

Sanders will not get a majority, he will probably get a small plurality and even that is a question now, the polls for the 10th of March don't look great. Without a majority all the pledged delegates from Buttigieg, Bloomberg and Klobuchar will go to Biden in the 2nd round and the large majority of the Superdelegate-votes will go to Sanders. That means that Biden will get the nomination and that Trump will get 4 years. I would like Sanders to get the nomination but it might require 3 million people protesting in Milwaukee to get that done.

As surface water warms, it tends to form a distinct layer that does not mix well with cooler, nutrient-rich water below, depriving phytoplankton of some of the materials they need to turn CO2 and sunlight into energy. Phytoplankton grows more than a thousand times faster than green plants on land, turning over in 2 to 6 days compared to ~19 years on average for land plants, forests take centuries. However, collapse of vital mineral dust has interrupted and collapsed ocean primary productivity at a rate of 1% per year, this in turn had resulted in damaging feedback mechanisms of ocean warming and acidification which are further accelerating the catastrophic damage to the largest and most potent ecosystem on this blue planet the all important ocean pastures and their phytoplankton. I'm all for re-planting, but we need to stop pushing gigatons of CO2 into the atmosphere, right now. Massive die-off of species could be incredibly fast. Even the "Green New Deal" is probably a drop in the proverbial bucket.	UCrGKTp-eYKgrZmcPQcnRxDA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrGKTp-eYKgrZmcPQcnRxDA	1	UgwDZuRKfi_lHTerFbN4AaABAg	Lady AM

In my observation, too many people don't believe that the real issue is a matter of total amount of exposed photosynthesizing plant surfaces and overall plant biomass diverting CO2 from the air. It's amazing to consider a scenario where global flooding from temperature increase would lead to a kind of course-correction where marine plant life would eventually have more room, increase in numbers, reduce the amount of carbon in the air, and potentially return the planet to a slightly lower temperature range again. Imagine how long it would take, though.	UC3RzKMz4PGQihsLQrGECCaQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3RzKMz4PGQihsLQrGECCaQ	1	UgwDZuRKfi_lHTerFbN4AaABAg	Lady AM

Under a 2-degree increase, we will probably see no change; the 4-degree increase would already be dangerously close.‚Äù ‚ÄúAbout two-thirds of the planet‚Äôs total atmospheric oxygen is produced by ocean phytoplankton ‚Äì and therefore cessation would result in the depletion of atmospheric oxygen on a global scale. This would likely result in the mass mortality of animals and humans.‚Äù Those blue deserts, our oceans, cover 72% of this blue planet so this is a very big problem. To put the ocean plant crisis into a terrestrial perspective in each 5 year span over the past 50 years an equivalent amount of ocean green plant life and photosynthesis has been eradicated as if we were to cut down the entire Amazon Rainforest. So add up the deadly toll, in the past 50 years we have eradicated the equivalent to 10 entire Amazon Rainforests! The world is full of alarm and concern about the state of the present day Amazon which has suffered a loss of just 20% of its trees.

Half-measures add up and growing more plants on a broader scale is something that accrues solid carbon over time. It even can return the carbon to the earth by decaying back into soil that can eventually return to stone. It isn't a "solution" but reducing the topic of carbon emissions to a binary of a total solution or bust would overlook a combination of mitigation that adds up to a solution. Saying that any geographical region is "the Earth's lungs" might be oversimplifying something as intricate as nature.

Every leafy green surface adds to the overall surface area of plant matter converting CO2. Every branch is a little less CO2 in the air, since that's what the branches are primarily made of. I still grow herbs in my windowsill. I still convince my family and former roommates to use live pine trees for Christmas and I help to transplant them in the spring. Now that I'm temporarily in an apartment, I replaced one of my lightbulbs with a (slightly less effective, but it's power consumption was roughly equivalent to the previous bulb) grow light to supplement the light from the window. The wonderful thing about plants, is that if there's a slight decrease in the global levels of CO2, they'll just grow slower. It doesn't seem like a bad idea to grow more plants as a means of personal contribution to lowering CO2 in the atmosphere. Some plants (like a hanging pot of Creeping Jenny) are fairly hardy and don't require a lot of attention and will bounce right back if you don't water them for over a week (like if you went on a trip and left them inside).

In 1973 there were 13.1 million hectares of total forest, but by 2014 the total cover had fallen to 8.7 million hectares. In October 2017, newly released data showed that Cambodian forests were cleared in 2016 at a rate of 30% higher than in 2015. There are almost no trees left now which has destroyed eco-tourism and led to the GREEDMONSTERS now fighting over the last few toothpicks that remain.WHY? Corrupt authoritarian leader Hun Sen and his crony capitalist friends have been lining their pockets FOR DECADES as they carryout MASSIVE ILLEGAL logging operations, that is why. They are so GREEDY that in 2012, the well-known environmental activist Chut Wutty was SHOT AND KILLED and numerous other forest rangers have been killed since WITHOUT ANY independent investigations being launched. <br /> <br />Deforestation is proceeding at an alarming rate: nearly 75% of forest loss has occurred since the end of the 1990s. Poachers &amp; corrupt one-party state officials are profiting from the black market trade in rare wood species, which is being exported to Vietnam ‚Äî and beyond, to places like China &amp; Europe where it ends up with a far higher price tag. Why is the price tag higher? Because the wood has been used to manufacture luxury furniture in upscale European stores. <br /> <br />Cambodia has one of the top 5 deforestation rates in the world &amp; the Southeast Asian Rainforest is 5th largest in the world. The despotic dictators out here first designate forested areas Wildlife Sanctuaries, get the Military they control to guard the trees or cut them down for cronies, smuggle the wood out of the country and the pass the money up the ladder to the boss men. How in the world do you think a leader such as Hun Sen can afford to OWN A THREE MILLION DOLLAR WRISTWATCH and accumulate a couple of BILLION DOLLARS for his family on a salary of around 30,000 bucks a year?

Rotting vegetation will still emit CO2 though so overall a forest will create less oxigen under these conditions. on the other hand the increased CO2 content does make plants more drought resistant because photosynthesis is more efficient.

A major city with big image being unexpectedly and devastatingly hit might remind people that things will and have already changed, and the only question is are we going to make the change, or suffer it.

Also though, it takes a lot of trees to convert co2 at a sustainable rate, and we've been removing a lot of trees from the largest concentration of trees that we have. There is a reason that the rainforest is called the planet's lungs, and we've been hacking away at them for decades without stopping.
