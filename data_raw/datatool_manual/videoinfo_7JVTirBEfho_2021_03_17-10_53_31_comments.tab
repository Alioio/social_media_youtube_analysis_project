Quantum effects create a degree of 'randomness' (or possibly another layer of determinism that is moot because it is not apprehensible by us), and so we still don't have the whole picture of what's going on at the smallest levels in the brain. No one knows yet. There is however, no evidence to suggest that cognition exists without a brain, so I'm not certain why we can't analyze our consciousness and everything else that happens there. Unless some of what we are exists outside this universe (no evidence for this), we can investigate it -- we're only restricted by technology and physics. ¬† There's nothing wrong with my decisions being biased... That's a short cut so I don't have to fully evaluate similar situations every second, but when it is important I engage in rational analysis.¬† You have to get a little technical if you want to argue these topics, it's simply not enough to throw out the proclamations of past seekers who did not have the benefit of our technology and accrued knowledge.¬†	UCRhOPUNQBd0JPDhjz5XHERw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRhOPUNQBd0JPDhjz5XHERw	1	UghzjwS_kze7P3gCoAEC	chromanin

If you apply philosophy, you can evaluate your own programming and make changes. Science will show you how to achieve what freedom is possible, since it describes reality and not what someone wants you to believe. Free will may indeed not exist (we need to understand quantum effects in the brain though), but ultimately I don't think that is so important. It's about making as many of your decisions (certainly the important ones) on a conscious, rational level rather than a reactionary one. You can program people, you can't program the truth.

UghQSkyqJiKUqXgCoAEC.85IJNWVHZIb7-OkFpu6yHE		1	2015-10-17 16:44:00	Jon Wise	@Anston Music According to wiki, power loss for HCDV system is 3.5% per 1000km, which does not seem to be that much. There are already several long distance (2000km+) systems (mostly in Asia). Obviously, the superconductivity will make it much more efficient, but I wonder whether power loss in the reason why they are not building more of those larger infrastructures or they are simple not economically worth to build yet (i.e. building them costs more than using non-renewables). In other words, whether there are physical reasons for not going it or it's just lack of motivation due to the fact that using non-renewables is still relatively cheap. There were some propositions to build, e.g., a line between Iceland and England to import Iceland's geothermal energy. It seemed that UK was considering it for a while, but I don't know the status of it now. When I mentioned gas / oil, I meant that we already build large international infrastructures to import and export energy, which means that we should be able to cooperate and build alternative¬† infrastructures to enable import and export of renewable energy.

But if we try to cull fossil fuels then using oil and gas is not the way to go (duh). There is also the idea of using electricity to decompose water into oxygen and hydrogen and then the hydrogen could be burned up where needed. The only problem is that it's not energetically very efficient or cheap as of yet. I've also seen suggestions of building up huge solar power plants to Sahara desert, and then set up the infrastructure to transport the electricity to Europe, but without superconductive materials that's not efficient either. You know, P=RI^2 and all that.	UCK9Of4nvtLy7-0w4j6TO8Ag	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK9Of4nvtLy7-0w4j6TO8Ag	1	UghQSkyqJiKUqXgCoAEC	Anston, Musician

UghQSkyqJiKUqXgCoAEC.85IJNWVHZIb7-J_tiPpYKb		0	2015-10-15 16:37:16	Jon Wise	@Camdex I think fusion is the future. It can solve all our energy needs for thousands of years ahead. It has no long-term radioactive waste and it basically consumes seawater. ITER reaction is being constructed now in France and they plan to start experimenting with nuclear fusion by 2027. @Anston Music If I'm not mistaken long-distance transmission of electricity is very efficient and cheap. European Union imports a lot of energy already in the form of oil and gas. They build large infrastructures to support it as well. Perhaps they could spend some energy to build infrastructure to transport electricity from countries with more advantageous geolocation to other countries which don't have the same advantage. There are plenty of southern European countries which have really good positions for solar. It's not just about solar. Countries like Denmark already on some days produce 40% more energy¬† from wind alone than they need (i.e. 140% of their total energy demand). Once the grid is in place they can make it source agnostic. In other words, when other forms of energy (like fusion) become available the same fault tolerant infrastructure can be used to make that energy available everywhere independent of where it's produced. That would solve any geolocational problems, like the one that Finland has when it comes to solar. This all is just my speculation. I haven't heard anybody talking about it, so perhaps there is a reason why this is not a good idea.

You have to factor in that Nuclear plants besides themselves have exclusion zones and solar panels don't need any geographical buffer around them. 1 square km of 100 solar efficiency is one gigawatt hour. This means 5 square km are 1 gigawatt hour at 20% efficiency. As for storing, Tesla currently making some innovation in this space. They already have powerpack which can store relatively large amount of energy are getting experimented with by big companies like Amazon and they have powerwall for users. Yes, they don't cost that cheap, but it's still a solution.	UCQHIe-9rnOYjGEXjQa1vTuA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQHIe-9rnOYjGEXjQa1vTuA	1	UghQSkyqJiKUqXgCoAEC	Anston, Musician

It's a bit unreliable and doesn't work everywhere. I live in Finland for example, and it'd be difficult to produce solar power effectively here. Besides, I don't think that area thing is really correct, could you elaborate? Otherwise I'm all for solar power.

CO2 is useful for crops, it needs to be in the right places (such as not over the ocean), and we will need CO2 to provide food because of the changing weather cycles. many old farms will drought, many will flood, those that are left must be able to provide enough food for the populations. <br /><br />we will have to actively cool the world by blocking sunlight, this will require us to go to space and move celestial objects. a geosynchronous asteroid or 10,000 will be needed to help block out the growing sunlight. don&#39;t think it has to do with the sun? go ahead and explain the changing weather on the other planets then. we aren&#39;t polluting jupiter.

When she started using expressions like &quot;We have to!&quot; &quot;We need to!&quot; She can&#39;t help it. She is a politician and that is how politicians talk. She even said at the end the so overused and cliche slogan &quot;No one is left behind!&quot;, &quot;No one is left behind!&quot; She just can&#39;t help herself lol. And at the end she also concludes &quot;We have to reach a higher moral ground, a higher level of consciousness&quot;. Again &quot;we have to&quot;. Its so typical for politicians to use this tactic. Appeal to our collective morals, while diverting responsibility from yourself. Its like listening any local politician anywhere in the world, they all have gone to the same school. After all she had to wire her brain in this way in order to survive in the political realm, especially as a first woman president in Ireland. <br /><br />She was right about one thing - its too important issue to be left to politicians. At the end of the talk I really didn&#39;t see any practical and pragmatic solution, mostly it was just another TED talk with a political twist. Not perhaps a political agenda but she is still a politician, she can&#39;t help herself. Also there is very little talk about the environment and millions of spices living in that environment that we are effecting. She focused primarily on people, I guess she still looks at the worlds trough the eyes of politician and potential votes. An environment would focus on the environment I would think. She also didn&#39;t conveniently expressed the concern about the overpopulation of the plant, because no politician wants to tackle that unpleasant topic. And it is a big part of the overall problem, not matter how unpleasant it is. Until we acknowledge it, there is little hope for solving both the climate issues or the poverty issues. There is no quick fix but certainly we can&#39;t dance around the obvious.	UCF7fal8AS64mMkPPwoC7T-w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF7fal8AS64mMkPPwoC7T-w	0

You must be looking back with rose colored glasses because there was a lot of push for clean air in the 1960's. In order to have climate control, there has to be evidence that the climate change has happened. There is no scientific evidence that the climate has change in any way that is not natural.

Do you realize how many &quot;bad crops&quot; there where in human history long before CO2 emission machines where even a thing?<br /><br />I&#39;m sorry, but this lady is just making assumptions without bases.

However, in order to reduce climate change to under 2 degrees, we effectively have to plundge ourselves into poverty. And we are just so close to ending poverty. In the 15 years, there will be no poor countries. So we either get grower riches and the planet warms up, or, we reduce the change but we&#39;re all poor. Either way, we&#39;re fucked. Another thing: Why do we call it mother earth? Why are there people who asume that nature is a conscious, real thing?

Even with current technology we could have 50% renewables + 50% nuclear at a reasonable price. The price of solar is on an exponential curve, just like microprocessors. "mother earth" is just an expression. lol.	UCH3xKgpXvAJ6yUuNSRkgKHw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH3xKgpXvAJ6yUuNSRkgKHw	1	Ugjmt960lsYO-HgCoAEC	Malcolm Pagett

Your statement is tautological. I seriously doubt that everyone who has read the "scientific articles" (and by your definition are now educated) agrees with the conclusion that global warming (Whatever that term is supposed to mean this week) is man-made, non-cyclical, etc. This is where the debate is... sort of: "educated" people disagree with the method or the conclusion thereby bringing the matter to debate. There are scientists who do not agree with the "concensus." In fact, there are scientists who's work has been misinterpreted to support anthropogentic global warming. These scientists have tried to speak out but get silenced or ignored.	UCGcxY_Ia_3pZ7nZlbkcW49A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGcxY_Ia_3pZ7nZlbkcW49A	1	UgihNX-yyvdrwXgCoAEC	Jim Quinlan
