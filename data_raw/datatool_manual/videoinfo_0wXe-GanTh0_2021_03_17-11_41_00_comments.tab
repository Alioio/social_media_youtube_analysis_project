You forget that not everything needs to be verified if it is included in the realm of knowledge that is well established. When I write a paper, I don‚Äôt need to reference or verify the fact that ‚Äúhumans have blood in their veins‚Äù or that the ‚Äúbrain controls the nervous system‚Äù. What you did there is absurd, but it wouldn‚Äôt be if it was something that is actually a matter of debate. Yours is an attempt to take to the extremes the scientific method for something that is far from scientific (‚Äúbrain made of jelly‚Äù) just for the purpose of hyper-rationalism. Brains are not made of jelly, therefore you claiming that obviously categorizes as a metaphor and as such not in the interest of science. so please don‚Äôt sell it as a subject that is worth a debate. If you had to question every piece of established knowledge for the philosophical reasons of doubt, you would end up with the argument that in fact nothing is certain, and therefore science is not certain. This is, nonetheless, a conclusion which is absolutely useless to make for the purpose of human development. Secondly, scientists never claim to know things that they don‚Äôt. Science has, in history, always been resilient and open to change its mind when newly found discoveries came about. There are things that are more or less likely to be disproved. For example, the fact that the Earth is almost spherical is highly, highly, highly, highly unlikely to be disproved for obvious reasons (we can actually observe it). Instead, the thickening of the retina and refractive errors of the eye in patients with Down syndrome (what I‚Äôm studying in this moment) might be as a less established, less evident piece of knowledge open to a scientific debate. Thirdly, shouting ‚Äúfact!‚Äù After every sentence does not make it more powerful, nor it gives indication to the amount of scientific rigor used to produce the sentence. Especially so, if it is said after ‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs brain is made of jelly.‚Äù	UCs6WQCwgs8PBzW5B_EepBKg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs6WQCwgs8PBzW5B_EepBKg	1	UgyLTGVv6ApRQoPkXC14AaABAg	Linda Agle

What you're suggesting is that everything that's known today is completely correct and future scientists will never ever find any fault with today's science. Take spectrographic analysis for example where they claim to know the composition and weather conditions on exoplanets hundreds of light years away. The science seems sound but cannot be proven as no one has been to those exoplanets to confirm it's accuracy over those distances. There could be unknown factors which have yet to be discovered which would prove their results to be inaccurate.

You are talking nonsense. "More fool you if you think science is infallible, that's what they thought centuries ago when they thought the world was flat" This is fallacious thinking. Science did not exist when people thought the world was flat. Using the scientific method, unknowns are labelled as unknown. Scientists do not make up facts or assume to know anything with substantial evidence. You should trust scientific consensus, trust me. It is foolish not to.

More fool you if you think science is infallible, that's what they thought centuries ago when they thought the world was flat. Also I don't have to provide you with any evidence, so we're at stalemate as far as that's concerned. You therefore have nothing and are in no position to claim that I'm wrong, so for you to continue to insist you are makes you in the wrong. Therefore you are the troll. Fact!

We have already started doing it. It could be too late to mitigate climate change effects completely, but we can reduce the amount of damage.

As part of their species, humans are classified as omnivorous (not vegetarians nor carnivorous). Omnivores need vegetables and grains as much as they NEED protein from meat and fish. However, in developed countries people do overeat specially, the meat (and fish) so these habit must change. Reducing the amount of meat and fish in our diet is a more reasonable approach. Also, being vegan means nothing if you buy your food from companies that use intensive farming methods that not only impact the quality of the produce, but also severally harm the biodiversity of flora and fauna in those areas. (Example: soybeans ‚Äê soybeans are mainly grown in tropical countries using intensive farming methods) As consumers we must make informed choices and be responsible for where we spend our money only then can we have a meaningful impact.

But let me ask you, do you think that the climate changing naturally never had any effect on the life on Earth? Perhaps you should do some research into mass extinctions, some of which were caused by climate change.

Climate activists can tear things down but they can't find suitable replacements at the same level. Like i said, pyrrhic victory. I'm not saying that it's ok because China pollutes more, i'm saying that if you don't get countries like China to follow suit as well, then all of your efforts will be for nothing in the end, it will just be one step forward and two steps back, people will lose their jobs and our modern society will lose its efficiency for no reason, so it's important to care about the present too.

It doesn't matter what we do because it will still not be enough to pick up for all the pollution that China and the middle east put out. Biden knows that, but all he cares about is empty self righteous policies that won't actually do anything in the end. You can't say you care about the world unless you confront China or India for example.

Even russia, australia, saudi arabia and whichever country. everyone will be affected. also, i'm not a hysterical climate "loser". i haven't called you names nor say anything about your belief. i just stated facts. and long time when we are gone, what's important is at least we've done some part in not destroying humanity's legacy.
