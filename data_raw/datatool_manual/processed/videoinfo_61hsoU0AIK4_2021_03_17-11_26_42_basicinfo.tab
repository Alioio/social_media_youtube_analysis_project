title	On The Front Lines - Climate Change
description	Climate change threatens us all. Even though, right now the terrible irony is that it's affecting those who have done the least to cause it. In this talk from Vevolution festival 2018, I share three trips that have informed my views on our changing climate and what we as individuals can do about it. If you want to take action join a Youth Climate strike, or Extinction Rebellion group near you. Note: All of the travel discussed in this video was offset using a carbon offsetting scheme at www.myclimate.org.
