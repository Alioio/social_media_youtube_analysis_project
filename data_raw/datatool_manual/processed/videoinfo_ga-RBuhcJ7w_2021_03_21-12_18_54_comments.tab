CO2 is a plant food and is not a pollutant. go to action weather.com for more.

You dont know that no one denies climate change. We dont deny something that has been constant since the birth of univerese. Those two counterparts does simply not exist. What we deny is all the hoax and the lies from the Globalists. For example- The earths temperature is not driven by humans. Its driven by mainly the suns intensity. And the earths average temperature has been constant for 20 years. We are not facing a warmer future where all the glaciers have melted. Its the oposite- Whe are facing a colder climate and a new ice age. In historically cases when the temperature has risen it has not been due to Co2. As in every case it is the complete oposite. And it goes like this: First comes the temperature rise due to mainly higher sun activity. The higher temperature releases Co2 especially from the oceans. Rise of Co2 ALWAYS comes after a rise in temperature! I urge you to find out who started all of this and when they started, and how many times theyve said we only have 10 years left. Look who started the Rio conference, The trilateral comission, The Roma Club, The IPCC. Etc! It is the same Group of people! The Bilderberg Group, The Kalergi Plan, The Pan European Comission, The Frankfurt school etc. You have to give this many hours of reading before its clear to you. If you put 100 hours of studying to this, then you can come back and make a new true show about a subject you understand!

Under strict quality control guidelines, all our instrumentation was calibrated daily and checked against primary standards. "We never based any result on dodgy computer modelling nor words like we expect, we believe, it is envisaged, or we predict...." With our very reputation as a NATA certified lab, we could never give clients results we couldnt repeat or justify. So I have asked this question many times albeit in vain, but please is there any climate change advocate, evangelist, ER teenage puppet or "expert" reading this? If you genuinely make a claim like "I believe the science is in" the burden of proof lies with you So describe an actual study that uses real scientific data, that proves beyond a reasonable doubt, that fossil fuels meager 3% contribution to the 0.04% of atmospheric CO2 is 1) responsible for climate change 2) that such change is something new or unexpected in earth's long climate history 3) how you moved from correlation to causation ruling out about a dozen other unpredictable parameters that can drastically influence climate? *Hint:* numerous greenhouse experiments have been performed that produce data that *prove beyond any doubt,* that increasing CO2 by 200-400 ppm have significantly improved plant yields by upto 200%. See CO2science.org I suspect that is the reason why carbon-based lifeforms like us thrive and multiply, right?

True, the climate has naturally changed in a cyclical manner in earth's history. Climate temperatures have gone up naturally, they've gone down. What's happening now with climate temperatures, the thing that has the climate scientists in an uproar, is the RAPID speed with which it is going up over the past 200 years. Sure, temperatures have gotten higher in the past. But not at the speed we've been recording. In the past 200 years they have gone up 2 degrees Celsius after remaining roughly the same for thousands of years. Think of how it is changing with how fast you can go in your Porsche compared to some guy riding his bicycle. Bicycle speeds are comparable to the expected rate of change of temperature during natural cycles over thousands of years.

East German former communists have had too much influence there that caused the migrant crisis. The guy is an alarmist. He does not know that in the 1930s the temperature was higher than in recent decades. Those 1930s high temperatures were "less man made" and more natural than today's temperatures that ARE MORE INFLUENCED BY MAN'S CO-2 EMISSIONS. A number of really old guy climate scientists stated on the record a few years ago that NASA has tampered with the temperature record. Here is a Forbs opinion piece that says the same thing: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamestaylor/2012/06/13/doctored-data-not-u-s-temperatures-set-a-record-this-year/#72631bc76184 A 96 entry playlist about climate has videos that prove Nasa has done such tampering: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqZGgaZaXig&list=PLjDpU1Cdtm7D7ig04hiQjPFS_Mr64E7UH&index=1 There is no doubt that the temperatures fluctuate naturally low to high and back and that glaciers and such have melted, but these things are all part of natural cycles that man has only a slight influence upon. Remember that the main greenhouse gas is water vapor and that cloud formation causes shadow that blocks out the sun from heating the surface level of the planet. When there are clear skies at night, surface level heat escapes into OUTER SPACE that has unlimited heat sinking capabilities. The politics of the world permits China to do anything with greenhouse gas emissions because long ago it was deemed a developing nation. Its contribution to greenhouse gas production now and for the past few years is HUGE. To me, China can no longer be considered a hands off developing nation. It is now the top greenhouse gas producer. Its population far exceeds that of other places. Its industrialization is only bound by the markets who can afford to buy from it. When these markets dry up due to unemployment due to all jobs being exported to China, the economy everywhere shall crash and a crisis shall happen economically that shall shut down a lot of the China industrial activities, but not necessarily that of the average population there. Globalism was planned for a very long time. It is very well funded, but misguided. A technocracy could work excepting that scientists are human and continue to make huge mistakes in their interpretation of data to make stupid, untrue theories. https://www.google.ca/search?newwindow=1&tbm=vid&q=deforestation+reversal+ted+talk+allan+savory Above video has old scientist admit he was completely wrong and instead of preventing something, he cause the situation to become worse, and ended up killing thousands of elephants in the 1950s and 1960s or so based upon his own crack pot theory that animals were eating too many green plants, etc, to cause damage to the soil that caused deforestation when actually the opposite happened to be true. To gain total control the United Nations has to be able to grab control of human existence to kill off billions of people by various nefarious means. AGW is just a tool to do this. The push to do this globalism is being funded by people who own the sovereign debts of nations who can pressure their governments to fund all kinds of harmful propaganda production to support their causes. Your guy talks about how economies are growing, but he does not realize that this is all due to how compounded interest on every nation's debts by itself causes inflation regardless of legitimate economic activity. There is a math regarding the doubling time of a compounding growth system. This debt money system is the key to "their" control over the entire planet. I suggest that if this control/influence were removed, inflation would largely disappear, and actual economic activity would then be measured more accurately. Also funding of war and weapons production would dry up completely. These various bankers cause the economic business cycles to happen. The boom and bust cycles put good people out of work and cause inflation with this compounded interest required to "service the debts." The R&D staff of companies are constantly trying to invent new things that help make life better through innovation. When this innovation is arrested by huge layoffs, the innovation can be suspended for decades. This negatively affects our living standards that could be much better were it not for these bankers tinkering with the liquidity of money and its cost to use (which should really be a free exchange process rather than bound by interest bearing debts that cannot be repaid because money creation lacks money to pay the interest on the amount borrowed into existence so that more money must be borrowed to pay that interest--a downward, insane spiral to hell. https://www.google.ca/search?newwindow=1&tbm=vid&q=paul+hellyer+banks+money&oq=paul+hellyer+banks+money Inflation makes your labor force appear to be more expensive so that slave wage nations can get their jobs instead. When all the workers have no jobs, who is going to buy the goods from the slave wage nations or pay taxes to service the sovereign debt? There is a logic and reason disconnect right there--a fallacy that needs to be addressed.

I am right wing (somewhere in between the conservative and libertarian) and I do believe that at the same time, climate change is not hoax and human action has severe influence on it. But I also believe that liberals (probably unintentionally), muddied the waters by adding their own agendas to it, so it is so much harder to swallow for conservatives. Meaning- they are the worst kind of messengers for this type of debate .. you became angry before you even listen to the end what they say. It is very unfortunate though. Just imagine that scenario for a moment and contemplate about possible consequences 😓. I am sorry, I will get later. Maybe one more thing: I divided the problem of Climate Change into 3 separate subfields: 1) IS THERE significant change of CLIMATE yet out there? (history of climate belongs here) 2) If Climate is changing, TO WHAT DEGREE HUMAN action is/was responsible (mechanism of greenhouse gases belongs here, human emitted co2 and methan belongs here) 3) Even if both 1) and 2) would be in affirmative - we need to answer separately HOW TO RESPOND, how to adapt or mitigate. Calculate more the consequences of different scenarios, mitigation or adaptation or both. This is more for economists to answer rather than for ecologists. My conclusions are after years of studying all sides: (we might get later into why, I hope), 1) and 2) in affirmative ... and I hesitate with 3)	UCiwGLO3AQyk_QYrTh-8fQ4w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiwGLO3AQyk_QYrTh-8fQ4w	1	UgzLIdeYbBe8PeqwOYB4AaABAg	Valuetainment

He did put here small numbers as we if it was “proof” it can not have an effect. You are completely right with Ozone! I wonder is it possible to convey this to others? His specific claim was about “small contribution of humans” .. that is total folly. The base concentration 280-300 ppm is not “a little “ , for example - this concentration was quite enough to sustain all plant life on the planet. And subsequently all life on earth, all the biomass is built from just this carbon dioxide in air with this concentration (concentration he deems to be “small “) . No one would say it again, that this is too small in this regard, after he thinks it through. And on many other regards this is just frequent logical fallacy. Do when humans are increasing this concentration every year by few percent, it might look like insignificant, yet it is based on emotional approach to “small “ numbers... It compounds over time! Human made the CO2 go up almost about 50%!!! and it grows up with compounded speed. Another 50% would take much shorter time. This all is hidden behind the unwise words of the “small” contribution of burned fossils...

The photosynthesis effective levels of CO2 are relevant. With increase of CO2, photosynthesis can get a small bit more effective. But it has a limit at 3000 ppm. It does not mean that CO2 starts to be poisonous to plants at all at that level! It just means that it doesn’t help even slight bit to photosynthesis to increase CO2 after that point. Moreover the increase of photosynthesis effectivity over 400 ppm is very small. It helps plants to grow somewhat better, but only marginally. So even this is not really that relevant metric to CO2 concentration levels... .... Something we really don’t need to think about too much. It doesn’t hurt us or the plants and it doesn’t help either ( or it does, but really only tiny bit)	UCiwGLO3AQyk_QYrTh-8fQ4w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiwGLO3AQyk_QYrTh-8fQ4w	1	UgzLIdeYbBe8PeqwOYB4AaABAg	Valuetainment

In the Ice age (the last max Glaciation and the six previous ones) the CO2 was from 220 ppm to 280ppm . Today we have 415 ppm of CO2. Last Ice age ended 12 thousand years ago, the CO2 for the last 800 000 years was no higher than 330 ppm. 10x? From what I remember, nit even the hothouse stage in the PET era had 4000 ppm. (I think it was just 1200 ) Anyway the longer in time we go the higher uncertainty with the CO2 conc science has. It seems that most safe measurements are going back 1 million years. And in this timeframe there was oscillation of CO2 from 220 to some 330 ppm.... until the 20th century.. that is.

UgzLIdeYbBe8PeqwOYB4AaABAg.92STYTmq8SN93v1OcbsEV5		0	2020-01-18 03:20:11	Golf Science Guru	We are still in the middle of the first experiment to show whether humans can cause dangerous levels of global warming. Thus, there are no experimental proof of any of the scientific theories, so that there is not yet any proven scientific theories. Until at least the 1st experiment is completed, it is a guessing game right now. The problem is that after this 1st experiment has been completed, it may be too late with civilization as we know it destroyed. Like in business and in war, decisions have to be made with partial available information, as if actions are postponed until complete information is available, it is usually too late. According to Professor McPherson, it is already too late, as if coal and oil burnings are stopped right now, there will be less smoke in the air to block sun rays, but there are already high amounts of CO2 gas in the air, which takes 80 years to clear, so that with more sun rays going through clear air, but with already high amounts of CO2 to trap the heat, temperature will actually increase more if coal and oil burnings are stopped. It is catch-22. Of course McPherson's theory is as yet unproven, as we are still in the middle of the uncompleted first experiment in human-caused-global-warming. McPherson claims that the runaway high levels of temperature rise will cause extinction of animals, and plants, which extinctions in turn will cause human extinction. This End-Time conclusion is unproven, as the 1st experiment is still unfinished, so there are no experimental proves to support his conclusion. Another great scientific book dealing with End-Times is the Bible. The Book of Revelations of the Bible describes the End-Times in great detail. The end-times are brought in by the four horses of four different colors: white, black, red, and pale-green. In modern times, horses had been replaced by iron-horses, horseless-carriages, and high-horse-power engines. The white-colored-steam engine invented by James Watt started the Industrial Revolution, which also started man-made-global-warming by increasing man-made CO2. Black-colored coal and oil fuels the modern high horse power engines. The GOP states are the red colored states, which promotes high energy usage, where the US life style has 5 percent of the world's population using 25 percent of the worlds energy, and thus also creating high amounts of polluting by products of high energy life styles. After China, which has red as its state color, modernize and adopted the American high energy life style, an additional 15% of the world's population potentially using an additional 75% of the world's energy. 20% of the world's population using 100% of the world's energy. The almighty US dollar is sometimes called the green-back. Unlike McPherson, who concludes runaway (as in chain-reaction) global warming will cause human extinction (as mass extinctions of animals and plants will leave humans without supports,) the Book of Revelations has about two-thirds of people wiped out leaving a third of the population surviving, of which those righteous of the making though the bad times will prosper like never before. Unlike McPherson who has humans depending totally on plants and animals for food support, the Bible says that food can be created without using plants nor animals. Jesus showed that water can be turned into wine, which is fermented grape sugar, which grape sugar is glucose, which is the simplest sugar/food molecule. Jesus also showed to "manufacture" starch and protein without plants by multiplying bread and fishes. These manufacturing of food was dramatized in the popular science fiction movie "Forbidden Planet" of the mid-1950's, in which Robbie the Robot is able to create chemically food for a luncheon, and liquor for the cook. Because of the green-revolution of creating high-yielding crops, and huge mechanized farming, it became very cheap to raise huge quantities of crops in the US, and in many other places since the movie of the 1950's, the work to imitate Jesus ability of manufacturing foods had faded, but this work may be recalled if runaway global warming should fell upon the world. McPherson says that it is too late, as we are locked in a runaway bus barreling toward the cliff of runaway global warming. The Bible too has us locked to a unavoidable end time, but a third will survive. It is better to try to be in the one-third, than to be in the other two-thirds. Specially, the righteous in the one-third will live in unbelievable bliss and prosperity.

"Why do you think govt is supporting that climate change is happening" Everyone believes climate change is happening; that's not the debate. The debate is about what to do about it and whether we could have any impact on it. There is one camp who wants to spend billions or trillions of dollars on the "green" energy industry and another that wants to spend the same amount on the oil industry; meanwhile, the nuclear power industry has almost no lobbyists but is the right answer to reduce pollution and carbon emissions. The Democrats support the "green" energy industry because they're paid by those lobbyists; same difference on the other side. None of this is relevant to the science. ---- The scientific facts are clear, the Earth warms and cools naturally over time and we've been in a warming trend over the last 15,000 years with massive spikes and falls in temperature, CO2, and many other variables without human involvement over time.

I just watched a congressional hearing today with morons saying that because CO2 is higher, temperatures are higher; and because temperatures are higher, we're having more frequent and more destructive storms. That's simply false, false, false... Not only do the data contradict the assertion that we're having more frequent storms, the strength of a storm is determined by the degree of difference in temperatures between the arctic temperatures and the equatorial temperatures. As global temperatures increase, the arctic temperatures increase at a greater rate than the equatorial temperatures; that will cause hurricanes to be less severe as the temperature difference, on average, decreases. But these basic facts are lost on experts who are testifying before Congress about made up metrics such as the carbon gap...

In Neuroscience, we mutate a gene and measure how a particular mutation/genetic perturbation effects brain function by measuring electric currents in brain. However, such an approach is highly impossible to show how those ice sheets are formed using experiments.   The point I want to make is that massive consumption of fuels and emission of green house gases has on huge impact on environment. Do not you agree with this?These changes might be subtle now. But, we do not know the uncertain future consequences.   I am sure that during ice age, there was not any hazardous industrial waste and there were no emission of green house gases.

What caused it to disappear almost completely within just about 1,000 years? Why did it form over Canada and not the pole? How did humans survive 300-400 foot increase in global sea levels over the course of a very small time frame? How did humans of around 13,000 years ago survive 18 degree temperature swings over the course of decades? If we today cannot survive a 1.5 degree temperature change over a century, how did we survive over the last 20,000 years? If you cannot explain how the climate changes into and out of a glacial period, I don't think there is any consensus over climate change. There is no consensus over how the global temperature fluctuated 18 degrees on the span of decades when atmospheric CO2 remained stable and low.

It is slow now, but after few years, non-linear change might happen. Another point that I want to make is that climate change and air pollution are correlated. right? Most of the perturbation that leads to air pollution end up in climate change. Therefore, taking precautions to control climate change is crucial.

Here are the few two approaches I would take to try and analyse climate change(global warming) whether it's caused by people or it's naturally occuring as were the arguments on the video. 1. Multivariate and Linear regression 2. Time series *Regression method* Use the data that has the following variables global warming temperatures over the last century, total population, immersions of gases etc. Study the trends if available, which will be. It won't be a stationary data. Apply statistical techniques to analyse the trend present. We make the dependent variable as global warming temperatures. Other variables listed above are independent variables. Use tests such as F-test, AIC, BIC, SBC, R-squared( not reliable), etc. Try the following methods 1.1 Linear regression 1.2 multivariate regression 1.3 Non-parametric regression Get your conclusion based on the results you get. Let your data analysts report the results to you and how conclusive they are and they must have a good predictive power. *Time series* Because the time series will have a trend and definitely seasonal, and not stationary. Test with following models, multiplicative and additive models. We need to detrend or decompose the data first before we can apply time series. Do the analysis, get the correct ARIMA models and check that the residuals are white noise, ACF, PACF, IACF etc. Report the results as well. I hope that helps a bit.

But pseudo experts insist CO2 is a pollutant that needs eradication by 2050. But what would I know I am just a science teacher with degrees in Microbiology/Biochemistry with a second degree in Geology.<br /> PS could someone please tell all those activists who insist the earth is burning, that we currently live in the short 13,000 year Holocene warm period of our 2.5 million year Pleistocene ICE AGE which is predicted to get up to 8 degrees C colder as the Holocene Period finishes.

So to get obsolescence degree in 50 years, that is 20 times faster than normal and is probably accelerating.<br />On top of that economists do not talk about Planned Obsolescence and the unnecessary manufacturing putting more CO2 into the atmosphere.

Just like the current US/China bioweapon attack. Their claim of wanting to protect us is as serious as the Munchausen By Proxy mother making her daughter sick so she can save her.<br /><br />Can we cause damage to the planet with man-caused activity? Absolutely. I think the biggest threat to the planet that we can cause would be to change the balance of weight on the Earth or to change the actual weight causing the Earth to change orbit moving closer to or farther from the sun.<br />I think the carbon dioxide hypothesis is a hoax except for the possibility of sucking fuels out of the Earth and changing the weight.

I called it “RUVOL.” <br /> <br />Over time, Ruvol will surpass chess as the “Number One Board Game in the World.” <br /> <br />Why am I so sure about this? Because I am an avid chess player myself. <br /> <br />The weakness of chess is it always starts in fixed positions that the opening moves become “memorizable.” In fact, not a few have so mastered the moves that they can play against their opponents “blindfolded.” It is for this very reason that the great Bobby Fischer introduced his so-called “Fischer Random Chess,” where the starting position of the pieces is “randomized” to make the memorization of openings impracticable. Fortunately, it is also for this reason that I invented Ruvol where “every game” has been calculated to be a challenging one to play. <br /> <br />HOW IS RUVOL PLAYED? <br /> <br />Ruvol is played somewhat like chess. It is played by two players. It uses a board that is rectangular in shape but contains more number of squares than chess. It has equal number of pieces on each side of the board, where each type of pieces moves in distinct ways. However, if the way to win chess is to checkmate the opponent’s king, the way to win Ruvol is to be able to cross a designated line. <br /> <br />But there’s one big advantage Ruvol has over chess: The Ruvol pieces don’t have a fixed position at the start of the game. It is the players themselves who dictate the starting position, depending on the strategies they have planned before the game starts, making it impossible for any clever player to memorize the opening moves. <br /> <br />A MILLION DOLLAR POTENTIAL IN RUVOL! <br /> <br />The people who play chess will be the same people who will play Ruvol. In my Google search, I learned there are around 800 million chess players in the world. These 800 million players comprise the “Total Potential Buyers” of Ruvol across the globe. At an average profit of just US$3 per set, the “Global Income Potential” of Ruvol then is US$2.4 billion. Assuming only 1% of it will buy each year, the annual global potential sale of Ruvol is US$24M. <br /> <br />I AM LOOKING FOR AN INVESTOR! <br /> <br />For the reason that I don’t have the resources to publish Ruvol on a global scale, you might be interested to have the exclusive right to manufacture and market Ruvol globally under a “licensing agreement.” Or better yet, just “BUY MY COPYRIGHT” and Ruvol is entirely yours. Email me at: rodolfovitangcol@<a href="http://gmail.com/">gmail.com</a>. <br /> <br />Ruvol comes in two versions: The Ruvol Major and the Ruvol Junior.

We will not live long enough to have to deal with climate change. The biosphere is collapsing and they are blaming it on us, blaming it on nature when the true culprits are the geoengineers accelerating the death of the planet.

Here&#39;s what I mean:<br />- in nature, we have countless examples of adaptability, from plants to animals to humans to the surface of the earth<br />- we all adapt differently, based on what we are exposed to and for what period of time<br />- we also have different tolerance levels as well as the speed of action<br />- we create events ourselves, we try to influence events, and we are most times taken by surprise by mother nature&#39;s events<br /><br />Based on many many factors, we all adapt differently and the world around us adapts as well.<br /><br />If we have the capability to influence our planets to the point of terraforming millions of square miles of land, we probably have a similar impact on the water and on the air.<br />If we have the capability to adapt to the planet&#39;s natural events, move, rebuilt, repopulate, outlast, out-improve, we probably have a similar reaction to what is going on right now.<br /><br />All in all, we can safely say, we need to hold ourselves accountable and stop banking on who is right and who is wrong.<br />I might not change the planet by not littering or using biodegradable products, but I can inspire others to do so. The result of that addition can exponentially impact a nation, or a city, or the world.<br />I might not impact the planet by burning fossil fuel or creating a lot of waste, but I can impact others to be just as oblivious and careless.

Then consider that the Sun and Moon are only about 3000 miles away from Earth and check the science of Vedic cosmology with illustrations of Bagavatham model. Check Eric Dubay and The Morgile&#39;s videos. Nasa is using green screen, fish eye lense to create an artificial curvature, the blue marble so called photos are computer generated illustrations. It is chemtrails [geoengineering] that cause a greenhouse effect. We can hardly see the stars any more. Ships disappearing behind the horizon are still visible with a zoom. It&#39;s not that they are not visible because they are behind the mass of earth&#39;s curvature . Scientific experiments have been carried out on the aether decades ago and it&#39;s kept secret that they revealed the earth is motionless. It&#39;s as the Bible says: have a look at the depictions, but if earth is flat or a platform of life as depicted in the ancient cosmologies [a;ll of them] it&#39;s not in space because all we know is what&#39;s above our head: the sky, firmament The Sun and Moon circulate over this platform. See the Videos: &#39;Heaven and Earth&#39; and &#39;Flat Earth the Real Name of the Earth&#39;. Don&#39;t give up looking when you search as Censorship offers all the videos that are against the concept. Globe Earth is the matrix for all deceptions.

Both have bought ocean front properties, so don&#39;t seem too concerned about sea levels rising. Your ambassadors of climate change have been tooting the same message for decades and have a made a fortune selling the message. I sincerely doubt their sincerity. <br />There was a time on earth when CO2 was 4000 ppm and the earth was green, and not destroyed by high temperatures. <br />Carbon credits are a cash cow and if you read the fine print, you will know who profits.<br />If you can name the company who came up with the &quot;97% of scientists agree&quot;, then you will know the survey<br />was flawed and manipulated, and yet that&#39;s the number all climate fascists quote.<br />Canadian PM signed onto the Paris Accord, gave tax dollars to the &quot;cause&quot; and yet approves and even<br />bought a 6 billion dollar bitumen pipeline. Trump did not allow the US taxpayers to be indebted to the UN to the tune of ten billion dollars a year, to do with what ever they pleased under the guise of fighting climate change. As stipulated in the Paris Accord.<br />Any person with a lick of common sense would look at all possibilities, like the work of the scientist<br />Milankovitch, which showed climate change in parallel with fluctuations/variations in the earth&#39;s orbit.<br /><a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2948/milankovitch-orbital-cycles-and-their-role-in-earths-climate/">https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2948/milankovitch-orbital-cycles-and-their-role-in-earths-climate/</a>	UCTtPUo7KW0F9CNDvKjNiHew	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTtPUo7KW0F9CNDvKjNiHew	0

Latest readings of CO2 concentrations into the atmosphere are around 413+ and climate scientists agree that after the 350 PPMs line was crossed, the climate would start unraveling. If average temps go up 2 degrees Celsius, it will be devastating ...we are on pace to reach a rise to 4 degrees and more sooner than people think. If the permafrost keeps melting at this rate, and the methane trapped there is released, it could be game over......the best thing you can do as an individual to help the environment and curve climate change is to adapt a plant based diet. The livestock industry is the worst polluter out there. It makes sense that since humans are the ones pumping all these things into the atmosphere and polluting the environment....is is human activity that will eventually lead to absolute chaos. We live in a system based on growth for its economic and political survival ( China has to grow at unsustainable rates to avoid social chaos). The exponential function is about to unleash its true fury in a system of constant population and consumption growth in a finite planet. Again, look into a Plant based diet, it is the most powerful thing as an individual you can do.	UCJEA2VlU5ET4CLJDrTSPXMw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJEA2VlU5ET4CLJDrTSPXMw	0

However , since burden of proof is on the side which asserts the fact, CC warriors must prove it beyong reasonable doubt. Also, if they rely upon woke cliches, imbecile virtue signalling celebrities and a deranged autistic 17 year old who suggests sailing back n forth Atlantic to fight CC, they hav lost the battle already. Most folks don&#39;t deny that excessive carbon emissions aren&#39;t bad and no denier <br />calls extremely polluted cities good for health but the paranoia displayed by far left (whose credibility has completely eroded) has turned a scientific debate into an ideological battle like race, religion and ideology. Pollution n heat cannot have right or left. Honestly, if we even believe that most heat waves came in the past two decades, it is also true that winters are getting colder n longer every passing year. If thr was heatwave in italy, it snowed in new delhi. As strange as it may sound, third Reich n Fuhrer in particular warned way back in 1941-42 that massive industrialization n traffic emissions will choke our cities in future n we must focus on sources of energy that has lesser impact on our surroundings. Third Reich was not far left n hate them as much as we can, assholes were the most scientific n industrious bunch of the time. Stop believing in the paranoia, it was only generated to shift manufacturing from first world to China n thrd world for cheap labor. You are more likely to die due to govt policies ,race riots, wars than CC in the next 12 years.	UCuEXUDAt0mIM-DV8fAHSg2w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuEXUDAt0mIM-DV8fAHSg2w	0

Capital and capitalists do not always seek truth. They seek profit. I am a capitalist. However, there&#39;s no point in really sifting through this if you&#39;re not willing to acknowledge that fact. The answer may very well impact you financially. You also must accept that while capital solves many problems, it causes just as many. Because of the nature of it.

In 1909 Robert Wood experimentally debunked it. (<a href="http://greenhouse.geologist-1011.net/)">http://greenhouse.geologist-1011.net/)</a><br />Question, do you really believe mankind has the &quot;godlike powers&quot; to control the SUN and Galactic Influences?<br />Fact, the Earth is in an interglacial (warm period) of the Holocene Ice Age, which means it is going to get very, very cold again. Is Mankind&#39;s action going to stop this?<br />Recently (2018) NASA launched its Parker Probe to study the Sun&#39;s solar wind. Preliminary results is that Solar forcing has been underestimated by about 100 % and formerly unknown galactic forcings have been discovered. All this is going to is to erase the phantom greenhouse effect. However, will Political Climate Science ignore these scientific advances as usual and continue its propaganda against the hard working tax payers of the world??

I also noticed your never addressed the questions I posed or commented on the other information I posted, which is "par" for the course. There is becoming a disconnect between the Climate Science of NASA et al and Government Political Science. The Deniers (like me) have remained steadfast in the condemnation of the AGE and it now appears NASA et al are now leaning in the correct direction. Especially with this Parker Probe project and the new probe that was launched about 2 weeks ago. Solar cycle 25 has begun, what to watch for is the Sunspot numbers. If they are lower or the same then the coming Solar Grand Minimum is still not here, if the sunspot numbers are flat, the Earth is in for a dramatic cool down like the Little Ice Age.

We also are poisoning and plasticizing the planet, and if we don&#39;t act quickly to heal and cool the planet, we will set in motion chain reactions we will be powerless to stop.

It's one thing to have sustainable products benefitted from oil extraction, it's quite another to burn 650 million years of the sun's stored energy (in oil, gas, and plastic garbage) and thus set our only home on a path towards mass extinctions of life. And by the way, the choice IS between survival or human and planetary life VS. continuing to operate according to consumerist cravings. So yes, I am already in the process of steadily giving up things that harm the web of life, from walking to the grocery store for light trips to retiring fleece clothing and keeping the thermostat around 64 in the winter.

UgzBn6admxJ_L7IP8TZ4AaABAg.95uzxM_8Zun95vnZ3_EELD		0	2020-03-08 03:32:34	Karl Wheatley	Speaking as a researcher who is working on a book that is partly about global warming, we know that the climate emergency is real, lethal, urgent, and WE caused it. How do we know human activity is the main cause of almost all recent global warming? Here’s how: 1) Burning fossil fuels increased the levels of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide) in the atmosphere and oceans. For the atmosphere, the change was from 280 ppm of CO2 to 415 ppm of CO2—a 48% increase. For the oceans, they absorbed enough excess CO2 to make them 30% more acidic. 2) We know the additional CO2 in the atmosphere was mostly due to human activity because as we burned more and more fossil fuels, the relative proportion of carbon 12/carbon 13 isotopes in the atmosphere gradually shifted towards the ratio produced by burning fossil fuels (2% more Carbon 12). 3) After human activity markedly increased levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases, the lower atmosphere and the oceans got warmer than before--just as the theory of man-made global warming predicted they would. 4) After human activity markedly increased levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases, the upper atmosphere got cooler--just as the theory of man-made global warming predicted it would: This happens because the additional CO2 we added is now trapping more of that heat in the lower atmosphere. 5) After human activity markedly increased levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases, there was an increase in the lower atmosphere of the specific wavelengths of thermal energy that specific greenhouses gases (CO2, methane, nitrous oxide) absorb and re-radiate. Again, this was just what the theory of man-made global warming predicted would happen. 6) As human activity markedly increased levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases, there was a decrease in the upper atmosphere of the specific wavelengths of thermal energy that specific greenhouses gases (CO2, methane, nitrous oxide) absorb and re-radiate. Again, this was just what the theory of man-made global warming predicted would happen. 7) Models of the relationship between levels of greenhouse gases and average global temperatures have predicted global warming with impressive accuracy. https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-how-well-have-climate-models-projected-global-warming 8) Research that takes into consideration the effects of multiple natural factors (sun’s activity, earth’s orbit, etc.) and anthropogenic (man-made) factors on global temperatures has found that the addition of greenhouse gases due to burning fossil fuels caused all of the recent observed warming. Taken together, ALL EIGHT of those pieces of evidence prove conclusively that recent warming was caused by humans burning fossil fuels. In terms of climate science, evidence that strong is like investigating a murder scene and knowing the suspect had motive, opportunity, you know the means of death, the suspect’s fingerprints are on the murder weapon and you have a videotape of him committing the crime. All recent warming and climate disruption is due to us burning fossil fuels. To dip your toes into the evidence, try all three levels of content in the link below, but especially see Figures 4b, c, and d in the “Advanced” level: https://skepticalscience.com/empirical-evidence-for-co2-enhanced-greenhouse-effect-advanced.htm http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2004/12/how-do-we-know-that-recent-cosub2sub-increases-are-due-to-human-activities-updated/ Also see https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jul/24/scientific-consensus-on-humans-causing-global-warming-passes-99 Finally, it’s the SPEED of temperature and CO2 changes which is so lethal to the web of life—TEN TIMES faster than when coming out of an ice age. Most life can’t adapt to the rapid and cascading changes that brings, and our civilization is totally unprepared for the tsunami of rapid and harmful changes coming our way in the next century (but already beginning now). If we stay on the path we are on, that leads towards the degradation and then collapse of ecosystems and thus the collapse of ecosystems, and thus the collapse of our food supply, society, and population. I’m almost 60, have two young adult kids, generally care about people and nature, and wish we didn’t do this, but we did. Happily, there are hundreds of strategies for healing and restoring a healthy balance, but we will need to switch to lifestyles and an economic model that actually obey the limits and laws of nature. That includes a RAPID transition away from burning fossil fuels and simpler lifestyles in wealthy nations (especially for the rich folks whose lifestyles cause by far the most damage). Take care.

Climate change hoax benefits the UN increasing its power to push socialist one world order. Power, control for a few and money is what&#39;s it is all about!

How do we know human activity is the main cause of almost all recent global warming? Here’s how: 1) Burning fossil fuels increased the levels of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide) in the atmosphere and oceans.

Dr Holmes sourced data collected by NASA during its missions to the planet Venus. He discovered that at the same pressure gradient as that of the surface atmospheric pressure of Earth that the temperature of both Earth and Venus are identical. What this means is that Venus and Earth&#39;s atmospheric temperature depend ONLY on pressure and solar activity as Venus has 96.5% CO2 and Earth 0.04% CO2 yet at the same barometric pressure 1atm there is NO DIFFERENCE IN TEMPERATURE.

We dont deny something that has been constant since the birth of univerese. Those two counterparts does simply not exist.<br />What we deny is all the hoax and the lies from the Globalists. For example- The earths temperature is not driven by humans. Its driven by mainly the suns intensity. And the earths average temperature has been constant for 20 years. We are not facing a warmer future where all the glaciers have melted. Its the oposite- Whe are facing a colder climate and a new ice age. In historically cases when the temperature has risen it has not been due to Co2. As in every case it is the complete oposite. And it goes like this: First comes the temperature rise due to mainly higher sun activity. The higher temperature releases Co2 especially from the oceans. Rise of Co2 ALWAYS comes after a rise in temperature!<br />I urge you to find out who started all of this and when they started, and how many times theyve said we only have 10 years left. Look who started the Rio conference, The trilateral comission, The Roma Club, The IPCC.<br />Etc! It is the same Group of people!<br />The Bilderberg Group, The Kalergi Plan, The Pan European Comission, The Frankfurt school etc.<br />You have to give this many hours of reading before its clear to you. <br />If you put 100 hours of studying to this, then you can come back and make a new true show about a subject you understand!

You use &quot;50 years, 1 degree&quot;. Any idea what happened before 1970? Well, let&#39;s start with a rise throughout the early 1900&#39;s in temps. Records from around the country were in the mid-1930&#39;s. Scientists could see no reason it would turn around. When it started to cool finally, there was news NON-STOP about the coming Ice Age, because the scientists could see no reason the cooling trends would turn around. I&#39;m old enough to remember this clearly first hand.<br /><br /><br />So yes - in your claimed &quot;want to know both sides&quot;, perhaps you should have at least applied facts to the facts. I could easily limit my data to what I want so I can make a pitch. You started yours clearly in favor of limiting your approach to it being dangerously real.<br /><br /><br />You never once applied the reality that real power AND MONEY are to be made by POLITICIANS if they can take control of the energy economy in a the same way you talked about &quot;science&quot; being on the side of the &quot;real&quot; side.<br /><br /><br />The prime requisite of a con is to be able to feign sincerity.

Your video is devoid of real physics and real data and so is no basis for any rational person to make a decision. You need to read and understand the science papers not the politically motivated reports by the MSM and certainly not the views of Al Gore and his ilk like Great Thunberg.<br /><a href="https://youtu.be/RU5K_ZrrSMo">https://youtu.be/RU5K_ZrrSMo</a>	UC5UwyHs6XNxGyhAJxIoS3sQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5UwyHs6XNxGyhAJxIoS3sQ	0

They are storing heat at day, and releasing it at night. The number one factor why the earth is warmer at night than moon is not a claimed &quot;green house effect&quot; but the energy storage capacity of oceans. The atmosphere only plays a secondary role by transporting ocean-heat via winds. Of course, &quot;air&quot; is a good isolator. But in case of a planet, against what should &quot;air&quot; isolate the planet? Against the vacuum of space? Air is a good isolator in between media. Gases transfer heat by hitting other atoms. Due to the very low density of a gas, it cannot hit many atoms. In space, there is no media and thus no atoms at all to hit. The only way earth can give heat into space is via heat radiation. The absorption of heat radiation by air which is a gas mixture is, if existent, negligible.	UCizVkGZCjHXssrCL5UfVyTQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCizVkGZCjHXssrCL5UfVyTQ	0

And when you chop trees down the wood stores co2 unril it&#39;s burned. And a lot of wood is used in construction and manufacturing which retain the co2. And there are more trees now than at the start of the industrial revolution cos people burned coal instead of trees.

Scientists from broad ranges of specialization all agree in overwhelming numbers that climate change is real and that mankind is the cause. If you were to invite 5 scientists who argue that climate change is a hoax, to accurately represent the scientific community you would have to invite 95 scientists arguing the other side. To give both sides equal footing indicates that you 1) are ignoring vast amounts of data indicating that climate change is real and 2) it indicates you don&#39;t understand science because the scientific method is fueled by data and facts.

UgzBGe0d8x02eXxQcnd4AaABAg	0	0	2020-02-23 18:43:35	Bud Blumenthal	I understand you try at figuring this out. But the question doesn&#39;t need any more debate. It&#39;s been over for years. There is so much research that is available that if you are still asking these questions about wether it is real or not or even if humanity is the main driver, then you you lazy, ingenuous or unable to understand basic science. The vastness of the numbers, the scale of the problem and it&#39;s implications are both difficult to visualise and then difficult to face. Finally it is a question of courage to put what is convient for you into balance with what is physical reality. If you want to not have to summon the courage to face the physical reality of this planet, then just continue to hem and haw, willingly try not to &quot;see&quot; the physical mechanisms and the effects in this closed system and deny their reality. Here is the one mechanism that I could visualise and really grasp that made it strike home. Besides the simple superposition of global temperature and global CO2 graphs that leaves little doubt of a correlation, there is the mechanics of how CO2 creates heat, or if you will, how it traps heat. There are two oxygen atoms with a carbon atom in the middle. It so happens that the wavelength of some infrared radiation is the same as the physical size of the bonds such that the radiation literally stretches, compresses or bends the form of the CO2 molecules. When the stretching is assymetrical or when there is bending, and this occurs with precise IR frequencies, then they are absorbing the radiative energy rather than that radiation escaping to outer space. When those molecules vibrate with the frequency of the infrared radiation that would be on it&#39;s way out to space, then that energy bent back in to our atmosphere in the form of heat and the temperature of our atmosphere is going up. There is no question or debate about this. That is what needs to be gotten. Anyone here can debate as long and as hard as the wish but the fact is that as CO2 increases in the atmosphere, more IR radiation is bent back into our atmosphere and the the temperature of our atmosphere increases. At the level of CO2 we have at present, heat will continue to increase for quite some time. Wanna bring the heat down? Reduce the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. But that ain&#39;t happening. Every time you exhale, turn on a lamp, cook a steak, drive a mile, fabricate an object.. well, more CO2 gets produced and released into the atmosphere. Every single time. With every single breath, gesture, trip and purchase. That&#39;s the sad, very very sad truth. The intolerably sad truth. I&#39;m truly sorry. For us all. ... That said, the only way to survive psychologically is either to ignore it, pretend it doesn&#39;t exist or do something to reverse the catastrophic process we are all participating in. One way is to sell your car and never take an airplane again. Another is to only eat vegetarian. Another is to stop buying stuff. Another is to plant trees. Another is to restore natural eco-systems : grasslands, prairie and forests. Another is to spread the word and help other humans realise the terrible situation we&#39;ve unwittingly created. Another is to fight against those who are willingly or unwittingly denying the reality and suppressing the knowledge and promoting commerce, investment and extraction of fossile energy. Also make peace with your god and seriously explore what might come after this existence. <a href="https://youtu.be/AF1JPg20amY">https://youtu.be/AF1JPg20amY</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/3ojaDMadZXU">https://youtu.be/3ojaDMadZXU</a> <a href="https://extinctionrebellion.us/">https://extinctionrebellion.us</a>	UCVNhmxp94VRjPWN_V3EgMjA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVNhmxp94VRjPWN_V3EgMjA	0

Meanwhile, to the discredit of science itself, we are seeing important, d-e-l-i-berate manipulation of past climatic data/temperatures to fit &quot;warmist&#39;s&quot; poorly performing model projections - simply making stuff up about what the climate has done and is doing. T. Heller shows this Orwellian phenomenon elegantly, often and to convincing effect illustrating weather phenomenon events and patterns through the lens of voluminous newspaper and other reports over many decades of public record which fly in the face of meaningful correlations with past 280/ppm levels, or increased, yet still (even at 410/ppm) historically low levels of atmospheric Co2....yes I listen also to Dr. Mann, Dr. Hansen, the shrill one-sided general media, and even Al Gore, who I think will go down as one of the greatest of all modern charlatans....disgraceful!

I've provided compelling evidence that AGW is real, that the overwhelming majority of scientists have concluded humans caused most recent warming, that many models HAVE been accurate, and that AGW is an urgent threat to life on Earth. I presented links to research STUDIES backing up my points, and backing up my rebuttals to your AGW denier claims. In contrast, you keep endlessly repeating the same slogans "axial precession" without facing the fact that natural causes of global warming have been ruled out as causes of recent net warming. And just for fun, I suppose, you keep insulting me. I'm sure you are very good at many thing, but with all due respect, I have won this debate handily and am not learning anything from your comments or immature insults. So our discussion is done.

Actually, no, they haven't... because without these many factors, you wouldn't have variations in climate, whatsoever." My bad, maybe I need to spell it out more: Yes, natural factors can and have influenced climate in the past. However, over the time period in question--the last few decades to last 150 years--the net temperature effect of all those natural factors is either slight cooling, no change, or the tiniest bit of warming (depending on what time span you choose). Thus, scientists can safely say that all or virtually all recent warming was caused by human activity. Furthermore, we have other human fingerprints on the warming, as I noted earlier. "You're clearly not understanding the importance of studying individual fields in order to find discrepencies, contradictions, and anomalies." Actually, I've spent almost 40 years of my career doing that, but also doing big-picture syntheses. Across multiple disciples, the evidence conclusively shows that human activity is steadily destroying the Earth's ability to support life--including human life. ""Warming" in rural areas has made much, much slower progress." That's a myth: https://www.skepticalscience.com/urban-heat-island-effect.htm By the way, presumably you know that by far the greatest warming has happened in the Arctic, which is overwhelmingly rural. The average temps is the world's most northernmost city (a small town), Longyearbyen Norway, have been up over 7 degrees F. "The only models that have been even half-assed accurate, you can't name." I believe I've linked you to this before, but in case you forgot: https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-how-well-have-climate-models-projected-global-warming https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2019GL085378 "Not as of yet is it 100% proven to be a global influence. Your claims are comically incorrect." Very few things in science are 100%, so by arguing for 100% certainty, you either don't understand science, or simply don't want to make the changes necessary, or maybe you are personally part of the paid "Manufacturing Doubt" brigade.

No, warming has been just as significant in rural areas as in urban ones. We have the actual global information and we have had models that predicted warming accurately based on increased CO2 emissions since the 1980s.

Uh, the BIGGEST factor in anthropogenic global warming is that human-caused increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas levels is keeping more of the thermal energy that originated from the sun in the troposphere for longer. We are also adding more thermal energy by burning fossil fuels. In the meantime, I see you haven't addressed my point that steady levels of escaping heat to space simply prove we are heating the planet. Take care.

Actually, I'm not frustrated at all: I'm practicing explaining this to people who don't understand it. Of course more or less CO2 affects heat escaping the lower atmosphere: In fact, one of the hallmarks proofs of AGW is that AFTER we burned lots more fossil fuels, less thermal energy escaped to the upper atmosphere at the wavelengths that GGs absorb and re-radiate. If you are still pretending that greenhouse gases don't behave as greenhouse gases despite abundant evidence that they do, then there is some other reason--unrelated to science--why you can't face up to what humans are doing to the world. For purposes of this discussion, it doesn't matter what UV does so much because the thermal energy being "trapped" or delayed in escaping our lower atmosphere is mostly IR. Take care.

If only that were true" We KNOW that is true: Carbon accounting research shows we have burned enough fossil fuels to raise atmospheric CO2 levels to 500 ppm but a a lot of it was absorbed by the oceans, so we only raised it 48%. CO2 that comes from burning fossil fuels has a slightly different ratio of carbon 12 to carbon 13 isotopes, so that allows for calculating how human activity is causing the increase in atmospheric CO2. Thermal vibration is what ALLOWS CO2 to be a greenhouse gas. People have looked at theories regarding convection and we are still left with fact that more CO2 DID and WILL increase global warming. CO2 molecules repeatedly reabsorb and reradiate in all directions thermal energy that would otherwise escape to space, so the more CO2 molecules there are, the more slowly heat escapes to space: Whether you want to call that trapping or delaying or accumulating, the net effect is that it gets warmer and warmer. The fact that you keep bringing up the 4% suggests that you perhaps haven't thought through the math over a long period of time. Overspend a $100K budget every year for 25 years by 4% and you will wind up at least $100 K in debt (not counting compounded interest, which in the case of global warming comes in the form of positive feedback loops). The poitn is we are disrupting the natural balance of nature, and even if we were only doing it by 1% per year, the effects of that would eventually be catastrophic. Sorry, but the accuracy of so many models of global warming shows climate scientists have this figured out quite well. Take care.

The helpful way to think about it was that the carbon budget was in balance until humans started burning fossil fuels. No matter how small the overdraft on your checking account, it you keep doing it long enough, it creates a problem. Our emissions have been throwing the Earth's annual carbon balance out of whack for over a century, so the net result of that is that we increased atmospheric CO2 levels almost 50%. That then leads to heat staying trapped in the atmosphere for longer than if we hadn't burned fossil fuels, and a hotter planet disrupts the climate in countless ways. Take care.

Natural sources of temperature changes have all been ruled out as causes of recent warming. "most studies are conducted in, and around urban areas of high population." That's simply not true and urban heat island effects have been ruled out as creating a false conclusion re: global warming as the differences between pre-post temps in rural vs urban data are inconsequential. https://skepticalscience.com/urban-heat-island-effect.htm And the robustness of theories of AGW are confirmed by the fact that climate models have been quite accurate in predicting how much more CO2 would produce how much more global warming, including models going back to the 1980s: https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-how-well-have-climate-models-projected-global-warming Take care.

"Axial precession and satellite data both explain why the warming phenomenon is not infact "global". Actually, global WARMING is in fact global, so that basic premise is false. With the exception of areas in the ocean near Greenland and Antarctica that have maintained steady temps or got slightly cooler due to accelerated melting of adjacent glaciers, warming IS GLOBAL over the last 50 - 140 years: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4bSxb5THm4 "Anyhow, congrats for completely ignoring basics of atmospheric chemistry, and studies. Atmospheric carbon (same properties in form of CO2), distributes heat, whether you like it or not. It doesn't trap heat" With all due respect, you either don't understand the process or haven't thought through the net effects of the process. Thermal energy rising through the atmosphere that might otherwise escape directly to space gets absorbed by molecules of CO. They re-radiate that energy in all directions (your "distribute") but most of those vectors don't point straight out into space (and even if they do, more greenhouse gas molecules my be encountered en route), so that re-radiated thermal energy does stay in the lower atmosphere. And on and on the cycle goes, and thus, the more CO2 or NO or CH4 molecules there are in the troposphere, the more heat that would otherwise escape into space does in fact get "trapped" or detained longer than normal by the presence of higher levels of greenhouse gases. If the Earth works like that theory says it works, then after more greenhouse gases were released into the atmosphere in recent decades, scientists should find not just more global warming but an increase in thermal energy in the lower atmosphere that corresponds to the wavelengths CO2, NO, and CH4 are known to absorb, and corresponding decreases in the upper atmosphere of thermal energy at the same wavelengths. And that is exactly what they found, ergo AGW theory was confirmed. To dip your toes into the evidence, try all three levels of content in the link below, but especially see Figures 4b, c, and d in the “Advanced” level: https://skepticalscience.com/empirical-evidence-for-co2-enhanced-greenhouse-effect-advanced.htm http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2004/12/how-do-we-know-that-recent-cosub2sub-increases-are-due-to-human-activities-updated/ Also see https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jul/24/scientific-consensus-on-humans-causing-global-warming-passes-99 Finally, it’s the SPEED of temperature and CO2 changes which is so lethal to the web of life—TEN TIMES faster than when coming out of an ice age. Most life can’t adapt to the rapid and cascading changes that brings, and our civilization is totally unprepared for the tsunami of rapid and harmful changes coming our way in the next century (but already beginning now). Meanwhile, climate change models already take into account natural sources of temperature variation, including axial precession. The evidence is overwhelming that the combined effects of natural sources of forcing have not been a significant factor in global warming, whether you pick 40 years as the window to study, 60 years, or up to 150 years.

The warming effect of the trace greenhouse gases is so potent that without them the Earth would be more than 50 degrees F colder and humans would never have evolved. "Human contribution pales in comparison to natural emission" True, but you are thinking about the problem the wrong way. Before humans came along, the natural CO2 emissions from the Earth and natural CO2 sequestering from the Earth were IN BALANCE but us burning fossil fuels threw the whole system out of balance. Try spending 3% more than you make every year for decades, putting the excess expenses on a high-interest rate credit card, and see where your financial situation winds up a hundred years later. THAT is what us burning fossil fuels does: Creates a growing and increasingly destructive deficit in Earth's biocapacity (and it did so precisely when our population expanded dramatically and we want to make even more withdrawals from that already-depleted biocapcity. "Look dude, you've made it obvious that you're merely a researcher... that translates to biased emotional opinion." Actually, the reverse is true: You are someone who wants something to be true that isn't and I'm someone who has studied this for more than a decade and has discovered that what IS true is the opposite of what I WANT to be true. "Except humans are not, and never were main climate drivers. We aren't even secondary climate drivers.... that is the reality at hand. " As one of my earlier posts pointed out, ALL recent net warming was caused by human activity: The evidence is overwhelming and our fingerprints are all over the excess CO2 that is making the troposphere warmer and upper atmosphere cooler. Even Wikipedia has caught up with the science and has a simple chart that shows how recent warming was caused by us. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming It is true that in the past, before the Industrial Revolution, humans were not affecting the climate or the rest of the Earth that much. But now we have created the Anthropocene, and human activity is THE main factor driving significant changes in the climate, chemical composition of the air, waterways, and soils, and in the contours of ecosystems. WE are destroying life on Earth. Take care.	UCQJUC_hQh7jNdE3X0oyTOiw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQJUC_hQh7jNdE3X0oyTOiw	1	Ugy0HjboajB6czzYEF94AaABAg	xyzct

It's a snowballing dynamic in which increases in either cause increases in the other. The way the Earth works when governed only by natural cycles, that is usually the sequence. However, in past warming cycles, even when initial warming caused some additional CO2 release, higher CO2 levels have then driven more subsequent warming than would have occurred without the added CO2. See Figure 3 and the text around it in: https://skepticalscience.com/co2-lags-temperature-intermediate.htm But introducing high-tech human activity changes everything. Unlike natural cycles, humans can easily introduce more CO2 to the environment at will, and without any warming. In lab experiments, adding more CO2 to a container rapidly causes it to retain more heat from a light source, demonstrating the basic dynamic at work. Research on the Earth clearly demonstrates that our burning of fossil fuels increased atmospheric CO2 levels which in turn increased retention of thermal energy. The reason why people are calling this the "Anthropocene "is because human activity has become the dominant force shaping changes in the Earth, so appealing to how things worked before humans developed Earth-changing technologies is irrelevant to the realities at hand.

We are warming the Earth 10-20 times faster than when it comes out of an ice age, and this rapid warming (plus the fact we have made the oceans 30% more acidic) is what is so lethal to life. The last time the Earth warmed this rapidly, over 90% of marine life went extinct as did over 70% of life on land, including everything over 90 pounds. And that was without all the toxic chemicals and microplastics we have added to the mix. We are pushing Earth's ecosystems towards the sixth major extinction of life on Earth.

CO2 is a blanket for earth but when you increase the blankets at a fast rate its warming up the earth faster then normal. To eliminate is stupid but to regulate the pace of CO2 will help. Both sides are technically right. But to say Climate change will kill us in 12 years is stupid. And to say climate change dosen&#39;t exist is stupid. Anyone with basic science skills can understand how CO2 works and what happens if it is introduced at a fast pace.	UC8iSt5UWu-Q-ZTsSoCpp1Kw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8iSt5UWu-Q-ZTsSoCpp1Kw	0

Meanwhile the earth is warming and we really don’t know if we’re doing it or not! I want to know the truth. There is so much corruption on both sides of this argument and if we didn’t have such a biased media that can’t be trusted, who will keep everyone honest? And social media is filled with millions of people repeating the same corrupted facts on both sides. I personally believe in making change myself. In my life. I drive a Tesla Model 3 and I tell everyone I drive one because it’s the most awesome care I’ve ever owned. And it’s true. I don’t tell them the world is going to end if they don’t drive one. So if more people drive them because they are awesome less co2 will get in the air. I also started eating totally plant based. Not because they say cows are causing more harm to the environment than the transportation industry. I don’t believe that either. But I feel better eating plant based and have more energy.

It doesn't matter what YOU implied, you keep making arguments and claims about me based on a total misreading of what I mean by "education." "And I guess you don't know what post millennial means." I haven't encountered anyone in years who meant anything other than the generation by that term. But if you mean THAT, heavens NO! I am perfectly happy if you are Buddhist, atheist, or Jain. Doesn't bother me one bit, and part of my book is about how western civilization has been so destructive because white Christian capitalist men have been dominating everyone else and trying to make them like white Christian men. You have pigeonholed me at least five different times, and have been wildly off the mark every time. Meanwhile, are YOU opposed to women getting the same access to education as men do, or are you in favor of the continued immoral subjugation and repression of women? You seem to be avoiding this question.	UCQJUC_hQh7jNdE3X0oyTOiw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQJUC_hQh7jNdE3X0oyTOiw	1	Ugw4wvws-Mg_I6n3s_14AaABAg	A Max

WHERE did I mention anything about forced help? Again, you keep pigeonholing me as if you only have two categories in your mind. Good government has played an ENORMOUSLY beneficial role in making society more civilized in the last 150 years, in making life spans longer, in making society more equal, in protecting people from various risks or forms of predation by others, in opening new horizons that previous generations could have never dreamed of. We HAVE an economic system. When I was a child, that system was more equitable in many ways, but then a few billionaires launched a rich men's rebellion and they succeeded in taking much of the wealth and power from the poor and middle class. When I was a kid, because we lived by a different guiding story than the neoliberal story that guides society today, the poor were getting richer faster than the rich were and the poor and middle class had more economic security than they do now. We had a long ways to go on race and LGBTQ rights, but the system was fairer in terms of economic classes. That made people's lives better than they are when their physical and psychological needs are not met as well (like now). Cynicism is absolutely fine here and there, but you aren't cynical enough about how cynicism has been sold to you as an overarching philosophy to keep you enslaved and prevent you from working for the better world that is possible. When I was a child, there were still "white's only" drinking fountains, it was illegal for a black and white person to get married, but people struggled against what was unfair, and things changed. I study and write about the propaganda tricks of the billionaires and CEOs and one of their favorites is to convince people "Nothing will every change, that's just the way the world is." Adopt that philosophy and you become their pawn. Take care.	UCQJUC_hQh7jNdE3X0oyTOiw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQJUC_hQh7jNdE3X0oyTOiw	1	Ugw4wvws-Mg_I6n3s_14AaABAg	A Max

"You're actions are materialist, "if only we could educate the masses" you're treating people as an object to fix." Did you read anything I wrote about education? I've spent 40 years of my life railing against the banking/factory model of education and engaged in and helping others learn about liberatory forms of education. I have railed AGAINST deficit models of education. We UNschooled our own children through high school--as in they learned and did what they wanted to do all day, with some field trips sprinkled in (and reading to them when they were young). I have published multiple articles on unschooling and how to dismantle the factory model of education. This conversation is like talking to someone who only has a hammer model of education in his mind, so he thinks that the hammer model of education is the only model there is. But you haven't answered my question: Are you in favor of only men having access to education and women having no access? THAT is what we are talking about in poor countries, and it is part an parcel of the systematic subjugation of women. As primitive and stilted as you or I might consider their forms of education, the RESEARCH shows that when women in those countries are granted access to education, they embrace it eagerly and consequently are able to improve their lives substantially. Again, are you in favor of only men having access to education and continuing to get to subjugate women?

Helping other people gorw doesn't destroy the world.

"Nah, you argued my abstract conclusions, and ignored my concrete points about corruption, usury, propaganda, permiscuity, pornography, aging population, etc. " On the contrary, I countered your points about corruption, promiscuity, pornography, and the aging population. Social Security is fine despite an aging population if we tax the same percentage of total income as we used to, but we have been taxing a decreasing percentage. I don't remember you making a point about usury any of your points about propaganda. Nor am I a materialist--I ignored your point because you once again incorrectly pigeonholed me. Your zero for three so far on that front. "You can't achieve your goals without virtue. There's is no progress outside of morality." Why are you arguing that to me after I told you I am a long-time Sunday School teacher and morality is central to the book I am writing? I don't get it. But just telling people to suck it up and calmly tolerate an economy and political system that was intentionally rigged against them (and is killing the planet) when they could be living better lives (and saving the planet) is not moral. There are some other names for it, but I won't mention them. Meanwhile, this slippery slope fallacy that our only choices are chaos or tyranny sounds like the "small government" propaganda sold by billionaires and corporations so that nothing protects workers, consumers, families or the environment--and nothing stands in the way of maximizing their wealth and power. That story line is part of a decades-long propaganda campaign begun by a small group of billionaires (e.g., Koch brothers) in the 1970s. Take care.

Here too you have pigeonholed me incorrectly. The book I am writing is heavily focused on transforming our own hearts and minds--you know, virtues. But true virtue leads people to try to help heal others and nature too. As for the only solution being pessimism, that's a strange theology, and stoicism doesn't help us create much of a world. Sometimes we need pessimism, but sometimes we need hope or fear or empathy or joy. One size doesn't fit all situations in life, but if I were an evil genius trying to control the masses, I would definitely want to get them to settle for pessimistic cynicism only. That keeps their expectations down and then they won't raise a ruckus when I loot and plunder. Take care.

If you don't explain your points, I can't respond to them.

" It's pretty well documented that corruption is lower and transparency is higher in countries such as the Scandinavian democracies in which wealth is distributed more equitably. And one way we know those countries are less corrupt is that their governments more often enact policies that reflect the will of the people (unlike America). Another way is they prohibit big money from having the influence it has here. "Spouting this eschatological climate change is just going to further polarize people" ???? Not really, not unless the climate denier propaganda movement keeps fooling people. The majority of people even in the U.S. are aware human activity is warming the Earth and that it is a big problem. And the reality is that man-made global warming IS an existential threat to life on earth. Do you think that if a firefighter wakens people in the middle of the night in a burning house that they get out of the house faster if they are aware it truly is burning and their lives are in danger--or if the firefighter launches into a calm treatise on fire safety? Human activity has ALREADY set in motion the sixth great mass extinction of life on Earth. If you're not scared enough to treat this as the emergency it is, then you don't know enough of the science, and learning more of it and getting more scared would help (while knowing there is a path out). "Virtue is the issue, not neolibs" False choice again. Virtue is ALWAYS helpful, but neoliberal capitalism is a SYSTEM that is rigged to concentrate wealth at the top, corrupt/destroy democracy to do its own bidding, and destroy the ecosystems life depends on--to maximize profits. Either we replace neoliberal capitalism or ecosystems and civilization (and out population are doomed to collapse). And in fact, being truly virtuous would require us to fight and replace neoliberalism because it is an amoral, immoral, and destructive system. However, the "masters of the universe" are selling people like you the idea that if you are just personally virtuous, that will solve everything. That opiate of the masses is just another stalling tactic to distract people from the real roots of our problems while they plunder nations and the Earth for their own pleasure, profit , and power. Again, you are not being nearly cynical enough--or perhaps not being cynical about the right things. Furthermore, ecosystems will still collapse even if individual families opt for off-grid personal sufficiency but the national systems don't change. To save life on Earth, both individual change and transformational systems change are needed and they are needed this decade. "You say "we can't contain the consequences of nuclear" while claiming you can contain the consequences of other things like low birth rates and taxing the rich. " Global birth rates ARE already heading in the right direction and there is clear empirical evidence that education and meeting people's needs reduce them further. We already HAVE effective programs that have been tested empirically. We have no evidence nuclear can be done safely long-term and worldwide at massive scale. So there is excellent evidence backing my point and none backing your point about nuclear. Promiscuity and porn are moral issues but even speaking as a long-time Sunday School teacher, they are not major concerns for human survival, but the growth in the population is. And the global birth rates are NOT in any significant way linked to promiscuity or porn. And again, the growth in the population is already slowing and if we support poor countries with education and aid it will slow, stop, and then the population will start declining. Containing chaos in a caring way is called civilization, not tyranny. "so I'm sure you have this materialist dominating nature mentality." Hell no, I'm writing a book about how western civilization and capitalism are unsustainable models and we need to go back to living in harmony with nature. Take care.

Usury and advertising/propaganda is legal, corruption is everywhere. Epstein is a thing, like I said, you're not cynical enough. And virtue isn't a false choice. You're presupposing people are rational creatures but you need pathos. Spouting this eschatological climate change is just going to further polarize people, especially when delivered with condescension and implications of no empathy (really asking people to be partial). People understand virtue, it takes considerably more effort to teach dry formulas, but you can illustrate virtue in stories, in art. Again, you're not cynical enough, you're partial. Virtue is the issue, not neolibs. Self-control, delayed gratification, charity is needed along with growing populations. Cutting the birth rates is a sign you don't understand teleology, so I'm sure you have this materialist dominating nature mentality. You say "we can't contain the consequences of nuclear" while claiming you can contain the consequences of other things like low birth rates and taxing the rich. The ratio of boomers to workers is dropping along with an increase in life span which means you'd have to increase taxes to support them, to contain the chaos. If people had kids, and they knew the role of labor in the economy, they could support their parents and be self-sufficient. Institutionalizing and outsourcing our lives was comfortable but why are we so depressed? Birth rates are headed in the right direction? I wouldn't exactly call permiscuity and birth control (containing the consequences of indulgence) the "right direction." Not to mention porn addiction. The only solution is pessimism, followed by self-sufficiency. People like you who try to contain the chaos is how you get tyrannies. The "by-any-means-necessary" mentality creeps because of your eschatologies. It's always an external issue, never an internal one, thus evangelism is the solution, and when that inevitably doesn't work, tyrrany.

"All we have to do is get rid of corruption." In democracies in which wealth is distributed more equitably, corruption is much lower. You HAVE to tax the rich and corporations more and enact other policies to ensure more equitable distribution of wealth and power. Ain't saying it's easy, but America used to have much more equitable distribution of wealth when I was a kid, and we can do it again. And if we don't, humanity and the planet are both screwed. "Stop framing the issue as a carbon issue and make it a virtue issue about moderation." False choice: It's both. Either we create a carbon negative society long enough to re-stabilize things, or the carbon we have already released will continue causing destructive snowballing effects we would be powerless to stop. Moderation IS part of the solution, but moderation alone doesn't get us either to carbon neutral or carbon negative. And with 8 billion people and only about 12 billion acres of habitable land for us to use (the rest needs to be left as wilderness so ecosystems don't collapse), we need to get way beyond moderation and down to using only the resources that about 1.5 acres of habitable land can provide per year. The average American currently uses about 20 acres/year of resources. So we need a fundamental transformation of our economy, civilization, and lifestyles, or the ecosystems upon which all life depends will keep collapsing. "We live in an addicted society. " Absolutely. For over a decade, I've been researching and writing a book about what we need to do to heal society and the Earth, and addictions figure prominently in it. And lower birth rates? C'mon you are the epitome of tyranny trying to contain chaos. Low birth rates will crush us and you can already see it with social security and pensions. If nuclear energy and the nuclear family aren't options then you're not taking this seriously. "And lower birth rates? C'mon you are the epitome of tyranny trying to contain chaos." Whoa, who said anything about tyrannical measures? Global birth rates are already heading in the right direction, and if you educate girls more worldwide and provide aid (or just fairer economies) to lift poor families out of poverty, birth rates drop. I hope better education and more economic security don't sound tyrannical to you. (P.S. It's births in wealthy countries that are the biggest threat to the health of our living planet). "Low birth rates will crush us and you can already see it with social security and pensions." Don't let them lie to you about these things. Pensions disappeared because neoliberalism arrived (the Reagan Revolution) and social security would be perfectly solvent for the forseeable future if you just raise the top level of income that is taxed for social security. Neoliberalism begat growing inequality, and thus, too much of the nation's income is no longer taxed for social security purposes, and that is the only reason there is any concern about social security. Put differently, it's a phony "crisis" that is easily fixed. "If nuclear energy and the nuclear family aren't options then you're not taking this seriously." ??? Who's against the nuclear family? Not me. But we need the size of the population growth to continue slowing, then for the population to shrink significantly. There are too many of us and we use up too much of the Earth's resources. As for nuclear energy, human history is filled with tragic examples of people reassuring the public some new technology is "perfectly safe" only to find out it isn't--especially in the long run. Nuclear has not proven it can be safe across a few decades, let alone that we can safely store massive amounts of radioactive wastes for thousands of years. Why tempt fate by tickling the dragon's tail at hundreds or thousands of sites worldwide when there are safer ways to get the grid to be 100% renewable energy within just 15 years? And when we can and should reduce our energy use dramatically? I'm VERY serious, but serious for me means considering the ramification of out choices across centuries and millennia. The sun and wind are safer than having ever-growing piles of radioactive materials stored forever and ever. If the nuclear folks come up with safer approaches, I'll listen, bit for now, it reminds me of a hundred "can't miss" technologies that backfired in critical ways. I'm more cynical than that.

And yet you still quote the 97 % number. Scientists to today are funded by towing the narrative or they are defunded. There are a lot of credible scientists out there, challenging the hype, but you are too narrow minded to listen. While i agree care for the planet is required, your path of giving money to the UN and carbon credits to rich companies and the absurd Green New Deal, supports organizations which are in it for their own gains are not in sync with your concerns. Ten billion US tax dollars a year to the UN ( Paris Accord) could do a lot to feed a lot of poor people healthier food or food grow programs. You don't know me from squat. You have no idea how i practice my respect for the planet and it's ecology. And yet you assume you know better than others what is at cause. Obviously you did not pay much attention to the video. If you had seen the extreme range of temperatures on the moon, one degree change on our planet means what? A single large solar flare could change that temperature by many factors. Forest fires and volcanoes have been changing the earths temperature for millennium, the earth is still here. Humans not needed.

"they are opinions and the few i glanced at are wrong.They even rely your buddy Al Gore as being correct." With all due respect Rickie, none of that is true. What I sent you was a blow-by-blow accounting of how the major predictions of the theory of man-made global warming have all been proven to be correct. And because they have the theory worked out, many climate models--even ones from back in the 1980s, have been very accurate in predicting how much global warming would occur when we burned a certain amount of fossil fuels. And those points are all backed by lots of top-notch scientific research research. The scientists have how much warming we will experience if we burn a certain amount of fossil fuels by the throat. That's easy stuff for them now. You can follow the links I sent you and either get directly to scientific article or get to news media articles explaining those issues--and with links in them to the science. The points I sent you are all based on scientific evidence, not what some politician says. NONE of this relies on Al Gore--it ALL relies on scientific evidence. Many things Gore says he's gets right, but sometimes he gets it wrong, like when he overstated how fast sea level rise will occur. "It's 2020, 13 years after Gore said we had ten years to turn it around." You are misunderstanding the warnings and what they mean. When we burn fossil fuels, the ripple effects of that burning unfold of decades and even centuries because the CO2 stays in the atmosphere for up to a century, and while it's up there, it keeps making the Earth warmer than it would have been otherwise--thus setting in motion all sorts of other ripple effects like more intense droughts, flooding and crop failures. So when scientists say we have a decade to turn things around, they mean OR ELSE we will have to face a certain amount of destruction that is worse than would have occurred if we changed our economy. It doesn't mean the Earth will stop spinning and everything will die in ten years--it means there will be worse hell to pay if we don't wise up in time. It's a bit like saving for retirement in that if you don't save for retirement in your 20s or 30s, you can't immediately see the harmful effects of your failure to do so, but in time it will become clear that you will be forever poorer in retirement because of your failure to act in time. But with global warming, the harms have already started to pile up, but without science to study the issue, the human mind has no way to realize that me (and everyone else) continuing to drive so much is connected to worsening droughts in the west and the corn belt moving 100 mils north already and the forests in the Rockies drying out and dying. "They are still using the 97% scientist consensus which is a fabricated number. Tell me who came up, and how with that number? show me the list of those 97% scientists... You can't because it never existed." I can tell from what you write and have heard that your news sources are the kinds of climate deniers sources that billionaires and the fossil fuel companies have been giving $200 million a year to--to spread disinformation. Yes, they are still using the 97% number because it is essentially correct. Depending on how wide a net of climate scientists you survey and exactly how you ask the question, over 90% or 97%, or 100% of active climate scientists who actually have up-to-date knowledge of the science of global warming agree that human activity is warming the planet. Then if you dig into the science, you learn that if we hadn't burned any fossil fuels or chopped down forests, the Earth would not have warmed at all during the last 140 years--the natural drivers of climate all add up to essentially zero net change in temperature over that time. As for that number, SEVEN different studies have found 90% or higher agreement that human activity is warming the planet. It's brief, so you can read all three levels in this if you want more background on the issue: https://skepticalscience.com/global-warming-scientific-consensus.htm Unfortunately, whether we like it or not, man-made global warming is everyone's problem. It's effects have already caused hundreds of billions of dollars in damages and those numbers will climb as will the number of climate refugees worldwide--driven by the fact that warming and climate disruption will drive more and more crop failures in once-productive farmland. Economists have already figured out that it would be cheaper in the long run to take decisive action NOW on stopping and reversing global warming than to wait until things get really bad, and we cause more irreversible harms. I have two kids and care about what happens to all living things on this tiny blue ball, so I wish that wasn't what the science shows, but those are the facts. Take care.

I just sent you the chain of evidence that proves that humans caused recent warming and that the predictions of climate science have come true. The fossil fuel companies are spending around $200 million a year to mislead people about this, and it sounds like you've been exposed to a lot of that climate propaganda. However, the science is sound: In physics, actions have consequences, and when you increase the amount of something called "greenhouse gases" by 50% (as we have), you damn well better expect your planet to get warmer.

I don't care about Al Gore: Maybe he belongs in prison for the rest of his life, but whether he is a hypocrite, a philanderer or an absolute jerk is totally irrelevant. Mountains of research show that humans are destroying the web of life that our own lives depend on, and unless we change course fast, the future gets bleaker and bleaker. WE are destroying the ability of the Earth to support life--THAT is the issue to focus on. I happen to be a researcher and for more than a decade, I have been researching and writing a book about how the health of society and the planet are unraveling, and what we need to do to heal them. Here are the pieces of evidence that prove that 100%, almost 100%, or more than 100% of recent warming was due to human activity (depending on the time frame you pick). 1) After human activity markedly increased levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases, the lower atmosphere and the oceans got warmer than before--just as the theory of man-made global warming predicted they would. (see the links after #7) 2) Furthermore, after human activity markedly increased levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases, the upper atmosphere got cooler--just as the theory of man-made global warming predicted it would: This happens because the additional CO2 we added is now trapping more of that heat in the lower atmosphere. (see the links after #7) 3) Moreover, after human activity markedly increased levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases, there was an increase in the lower atmosphere of the specific wavelengths of thermal energy that specific greenhouses gases (CO2, methane, nitrous oxide) absorb and re-radiate. Again, this was just what the theory of man-made global warming predicted would happen. (see the links after #7) 4) In parallel, as human activity markedly increased levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases, there was a decrease in the upper atmosphere of the specific wavelengths of thermal energy that specific greenhouses gases (CO2, methane, nitrous oxide) absorb and re-radiate. Again, this was just what the theory of man-made global warming predicted would happen. (see the links after #7) 5) Despite widespread misinformation about this, many models of the relationship between levels of greenhouse gases and average global temperatures have predicted how much additional CO2 would cause how much additional global warming with impressive accuracy. https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-how-well-have-climate-models-projected-global-warming https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2019GL085378 6) Research that takes into consideration multiple natural factors (sun’s activity, earth’s orbit, etc.) and anthropogenic (man-made) factors on global temperatures has found that human activity (burning fossil fuels, deforestation) caused all or virtually all recent net warming. A chart on Wikipedia’s web page illustrates clearly this. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming 7) Taken together, ALL those pieces of evidence (and others not listed here) prove conclusively that recent warming was caused by humans burning fossil fuels (and other greenhouse-gas producing activities [deforestation, cement production]). To dip your toes into the evidence, try all three levels of content in the link below, but especially see Figures 4b, c, and d in the “Advanced” level of the first link: https://skepticalscience.com/empirical-evidence-for-co2-enhanced-greenhouse-effect-advanced.htm http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2004/12/how-do-we-know-that-recent-cosub2sub-increases-are-due-to-human-activities-updated/ 8) Contrary to misinformation from AGW (anthropogenic global warming) skeptics, SEVEN different articles have all found that 90% or more of practicing climate scientists agree that human activity is significantly warming the planet. See all three levels of information: https://skepticalscience.com/global-warming-scientific-consensus.htm The scientists most likely to deny the evidence regarding man=made global warming and climate disruption are those whose paychecks depend on us continuing to burn fossil fuels (e.g., geologists working for oil companies) or people whose political beliefs make it difficult to face the economic consequences of admitting that AGW is real and a serious threat: https://skepticalscience.com/Geologists-climate-change-denial.html 9) Recent research shows that earlier warm periods such as the Medieval Warm Period did NOT have uniform warming all over the Earth at exactly the same time. Thus, there is no other warming period in recent history like what unnatural human activities have set in motion. See… https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jul/24/scientific-consensus-on-humans-causing-global-warming-passes-99 Similarly, we know that man-made global warming will cause increasingly destructive and expensive consequences for nations everywhere. For example, now that we have warmed the atmosphere by 1 degree C (1.8 degrees F), it can hold 7% more moisture. Because of that, we get more intense droughts in some places and more intense storms and flooding in others (Houston twice in the last 5 years; midwest farms last spring). At the same time, California, much of the Rockies, and Alaska and Siberia have been warming up, drying up, and catching on fire more intensely. Take care.

"Let me quote you.."I've never paid that much attention to Al Gore or David Suzuki, " I have never seen such a incredible statement. The whole global warming narrative comes from those two "experts" and you say you have not listened to them?" Obviously, Al Gore was a senator and vice president of the United States, and ran for president, so I heard him talk then, but I never saw "An Inconvenient Truth" and have never heard Gore interviewed or lecture specifically on man-made global warming. I have read some David Suzuki quotes on the matter, but have also never heard any lectures or interviews on the subject. "The whole global warming narrative comes from those two "experts" and you say you have not listened to them?or bought into their rhetoric?" Ah, now I know why you are confused by me not hearing much from them on the topic--you are under the illusion these two chaps are the main players on the stage. No, the science of global warming did not begin with them and although they are known figures with respect to the issue, they ultimately are not particularly important. Scientists have been warning our leaders about the harmful effects of man-made global warming since LBJ was in office. Exxon scientists were warning Exxon about the harmful effects of burning fossil fuels in the early 1980s--till they shut down that office. James Hanson was testifying to Congress in the late 1980s warning of the long-term ripple effects of man-made global warming. Thousands of the world's scientists have issued major warning to humanity--not just about global warming but about all the ways humans activity threatens to make the Earth increasingly unlivable--one in 1992 and one in 2017. Numerous other warnings to humanity have come from published research and public statements from people who study a variety of phenomena--coral reefs, rainforests, insects, wildlife, plankton, global ice, climate, etc. So, to someone who hasn't kept up with scientific developments over the last 40 years, Gore and Suzuki might seem terribly important, but Gore was just a popularizer of a problem that was already well-established, and although Suzuki is a well-known environmental activist, he is NOT one of the scientists upon which our understanding of man-made global warming rests. "And then you make excuses for their hypocrisy." No I didn't. Although Gore HAS made major improvements to make his house as green as possible, he's rich and retired and should make a more serious effort to downsize his footprint. I know zero about Suzuki's lifestyle, but perhaps he should be greener too. The point I was making was that talking about Gore or Suzuki is mostly a waste of time when the whole planet is heading towards disaster. "If they are lying to you about their huge carbon foot prints, what else are lies?" I have no idea that they lie about they footprints, and if they do, by all means berate them for that. But again, when the house is on fire, complaining about some hypocrisy of one of the people trying to escape the fire is missing the point. Also, NEITHER of those two people is a major contributor to the science proving we are in trouble, so I couldn't care less what they say. We know all recent global warming was caused by us and we know it poses an existential threat to human and planetary life. THAT is what we need to focus on. More later.

I've never paid that much attention to Al Gore or David Suzuki, but whether they live in tents or 30,000 mansions is irrelevant with respect to the FACT that human activity is warming and poisoning the planet, destabilizing the climate, and pushing Earth's ecosystems (and thus our food supply) towards collapse. We are on a path towards mass extinctions of life on Earth and you are worried that a couple of people involved are being hypocritical??!!! It's fine to call them out for that, but let's get our priorities straight and keep our eye on the ball--saving the future. "The Green New Deal is not based in reality." Actually, it's based in the only reality left, and economists have already calculated it would be far cheaper to take massive action right now then to clean up the bigger and bigger climate catastrophes that will occur if we don't act now. Either we are proactive or climate disasters will take bigger and bigger chunks out of the national and household budgets. You think the COVID-19 effect on the economy is bad? What's coming if we don't act will make this look like a walk in the park. Also, if you understand the science of the problem, you can't solve our Earth Emergency unless there is a much more equitable economy. Put differently, the challenges we face are so enormous that we can no longer afford to have people too poor to buy organic produce or put solar panels on their roofs. Take care.

Top rate got as high as 91% after a certain level of income. The country didn't collapse. In fact, the middle class was created. You didn't know this. That's because you aren't too bright.

Yes, we need to transform the entire global economy, and American companies doing business in Asia are a big part of the planet-killing problem. I totally agree, and part of the solution is that we HAVE TO go back to more products being made locally. No one is talking about taxing anyone unfairly. Over the last 40 years, corporations and the 1% have rigged and re-rigged the economy to siphon TRILLIONS of dollars in wealth from the 95-99% and funnel it to themselves. Their taxes need to go back up, and go up sharply. I was born in 1960 in the USA, and corporate taxes and tax rates for the 1% were much higher than, and the country worked better because of it. I'm talking about corporate parasites and billionaires parasites finally paying their fair share. As for cheap products, we are now at the point in human history at which we must choose between the values of the long-term survival of life VS. the short-term pleasures of consumer convenience and low prices. I choose to pay higher prices to keep the planet livable for my children and grandchildren. So I am paying MORE for coffee, MORE for sustainable clothing, etc. This is a moral issue, and right now, we are getting it wrong, precisely because decades of capitalist propaganda brainwashed us into thinking as selfish consumers rather than as wise citizens focused on what is best in the long run for life.

However, I'm a researcher who has spent the last 17 years of my life studying and writing about what we have to do to heal society and the planet. So, with all due respect, I might know a little bit more about these topics and what has to be done to heal society and the planet than most folks posting on YouTube. I'm writing a book about all this, but when I run out of gas for the day, sometimes I post on YouTube. We have to heal society and the planet simultaneously--if we don't heal society, we have no shot at healing the planet (that;'s why the Green New Deal addressed both things like green energy and also jobs and economic justice). Anyway, to heal life, we have to encourage people to have smaller families than they might have planned. We have to phase out most burning of fossil fuels (we've know this was coming for decades but no one wanted to face it). Global beef, lamb, and goat consumption must decline sharply. We need massive reforestation efforts--and the land saved by switching to more plant-rich diets will help us accomplish that. Our global footprint is ~170% of the annual carrying capacity, so to stop running an annual biocapacity deficit, the footprint of the global economy must decrease by about 50%. So politicians walking around talking about economic growth are living in the past, and don't understand we are running out of resources and biocapacity. We need more broadly-shared prosperity, because the challenges are so many and so daunting that we cant afford to have people anywhere too poor to choose the green options, of governments so poor they turn to China to build them more coal-fired power plants. Etc. Take care.	UCQJUC_hQh7jNdE3X0oyTOiw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQJUC_hQh7jNdE3X0oyTOiw	1	Ugw4wvws-Mg_I6n3s_14AaABAg	A Max

In nature, there are certain ranges life thrives in but outside of which life starts to struggle or even die. The right amount of fertilizer can help things grow, but way too much can kill plants and crops. For the last 800,000 years, the global levels of CO2 were mostly around 280 parts per million, and they never got above 300 ppm. They were around 280 ppm when the Declaration of Independence was signed and the Earth was a lush paradise. THAT is the level most life on Earth and most ecosystems would thrive best at. But we started chopping down forests and burning fossil fuels, and that has pushed global CO2 levels to 416 ppm, a 48.6% increase in global CO2 levels. Most of the CO2 we have emitted has been absorbed by the oceans, making them 30% more acidic than they were not very long ago. If these changes happened over millions of years, life would adapt, but the majority of CO2 ever emitted was emitted since the first episode of Seinfeld aired, so we are upsetting the apple cart of life at a rapid rate. In fact, we are warming the Earth 10-20 times faster than when coming out of an ice age. As Joel Salatin would say "Folks, that ain't normal." To make a long story short, human activity is attacking and starting to destroy the web of life that keeps all human and planetary life going. In that context, CO2 is a "conditional pollutant" ... classified as a pollutant because you are adding more CO2 than life can handle well. It's no fun to think about, but the way we heat our building and get around is literally destroying the Earth's ability to support life, including human life. All this creates record-breaking droughts, wildfires, storms, and floods, and conditions for farming and living will just keep getting worse if we don't act. Scientists who study the matter say that in order to avoid the even more catastrophic effects that will come if we warm the planet 1 more degree C (1.8 degrees F), 75% of know fossil fuel reserves MUST NEVER BE BURNED. So hell yes, we need to be taxing carbon, and we need very high taxes on it. However, before we do that, we need to take care of average Americans, farmers, etc. Over the last 40 years, the 1% and giant corporations have rigged the economy to siphon trillions of dollars in wealth from the 99% and funnel it to themselves. We have to reverse the immoral way they rigged the economy so more wealth flows to the 99%. THEN people will be in a position where they aren't crippled by higher taxes on gas. We won WWII in part because of meat rationing and gas rationing, and this is a much bigger challenge and much bigger threat, so the old ways of thinking are going to have to get tossed out the window because this is an Earth Emergency. Then you reinvest the revenues from those taxes in green energy, electric vehicles, passive homes (can save 80% on energy use), reforestation, helping farmers do regenerative agriculture, etc. Take care.

If u want the summary here it is: Carbon tax is not all doom and gloom after all. If gov are able to raise substantial amount of carbon tax, the extra revenue will be channelled back to consumers like you and me possibly through lowering of income tax. BUT companies would try their best to pay as little tax as possible. Hence, they need to change their way of production that emit less co2. They can achieve this by, for example, installing solar panels, upgrading machineries to be more environmental friendly, and etc. Watch the video if you are genuinely interested in knowing more. Do try to challenge or find flaws the video if you can.	UC_qvRcvIfmUvpP-K0-7a-ZQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_qvRcvIfmUvpP-K0-7a-ZQ	1	Ugw4wvws-Mg_I6n3s_14AaABAg	A Max

But that's a silly level of cynicism: Government does a whole lot of things better than the private sector does. Medicare has lower administrative costs and has higher approval ratings than does the average private insurer. Government jobs that have been outsourced to the private sector are often costing double and triple what we used to pay government folks to do the same work. People motivated by the profit motive often can't be trusted to give us the straight scoop on global warming, whether their product is safe, etc. but independent scientists can. Single payer health care systems in other countries cost about half of what our does and people live just as long as us and everyone is covered (the government approach is MORE careful with our money because it doesn't have all the waste the private sector approach has built in--profits, exorbitant salaries, advertising costs, and lobbying costs. I'm an American and our government helped win two world wars, put people on the moon, created an interstate highways system from coast to coast, cleaned up our food and water so people would live much longer, allows me to sleep safe in my bed at night, and has protected our rights and freedoms for over two centuries.

Like cutting family spending right now when you are living off credit cards, rather than continuing to run up the tab, It is FAR cheaper for us to take massive and decisive action now to fix the problem than it would be for us to keep procrastinating and making it worse. Climate-fueled disasters already cost the world $650 billion in the last 3 years and the costs will just keep climbing: https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/14/climate-disasters-cost-650-billion-over-3-years-morgan-stanley.html We are at or rapidly approaching multiple tipping points for the climate and ecosystems, and if we go past those, we may find it almost impossible or impossible to stop the chain reactions. Thinking more broadly, the question is not how much it will cost but whether we will act in time to keep the Earth habitable for future generations. This is a multi-faceted global emergency.

To let you know of the convoluted game being played that has to be taken into account. <br /><br /><br />1: owners of Exxon mobil also run the UN as they donated their family land for the UN HQ to be built, they also run the IMF, CFR, WHO and WTO as they were all founded by this family. <br /><br /><br />2: The Green New Deal climate legislation was composed by Ocasio Cortez who is backed by Nazi collaborator George Soros.<br /><br /><br />3: NASA made a report in 2015 showing Antarctica had record Ice mass<br />4:NASA made a report showing the earth is greening due to C02<br /><br /><br />A carbon tax is being pushed by the IMF and other entities, this will not hurt the mining corps but it will hurt the people in society with raised food, fuel, electricity and rent costs. <br /><br /><br />I suggest everyone go and read the UN Agenda 2030 and the Green New Deal Legislation. <br /><br /><br />Merely a few big questions in the game being played.

That is .027% of 1% of the temperature not affected by the sun. Water vapor has 40% affect on that 1%. Carbon Dioxide levels rise after the Temperature rises. So it&#39;s not a main driver of temperature change. Temperature change is a main driver of Carbon dioxide levels.<br /> Let&#39;s talk the business side. This is all about a hostile take over of the energy industry. It&#39;s mostly Republicans who own Petroleum and Coal industries. So Democrats invest in Green energy and call Petroleum and Coal evil so they can take over the energy industry and get filthy rich. Al Gore and his cap and trade bill that actually does almost nothing to curb Carbon dioxide production. All for nothing except Al Gore who made 1 billion dollars and counting from it. Obama and Solandra, it was going bankrupt and Obama gave them a loan. Why? because he and his family had money invested in the company. They wanted to be able to sell their shares before they lost everything. Other Dems wanting energy companies to be state owned because they say the current owners are evil. <br /> Remember people, Politicians and Scientist don&#39;t have to answer for their lies. Corporations do have to answer for their lies. So who do you think is more likely to lie or has more to gain from lying?

Short answer is there is a strong correlation between human activity and warming (not that that proves anything) and scientific data can be manipulated to prove almost anything. A scientist could dip a cup in the sea and not catch a fish and publish a paper saying there&#39;s no fish in the sea and if he had enough letters behind his name no one would question it.

Under strict quality control guidelines, all our instrumentation was calibrated daily and checked against primary standards. &quot;We never based any result on dodgy computer modelling nor words like we expect, we believe, it is envisaged, or we predict....&quot; With our very reputation as a NATA certified lab, we could never give clients results we couldnt repeat or justify. So I have asked this question many times albeit in vain, but please is there any climate change advocate, evangelist, ER teenage puppet or &quot;expert&quot; reading this? <br />If you genuinely &quot;believe the science is in&quot; describe an actual study that uses real scientific data, that proves beyond a reasonable doubt, that fossil fuels meager 3% contribution to the 0.04% of atmospheric CO2 is 1) responsible for climate change 2) that such change is something new in earth&#39;s long climate history 3) how you moved from correlation to causation ruling out about a dozen other unpredictable parameters that can drastically influence climate?<br /><b>Hint:</b> numerous greenhouse experiments have been performed that produce data that prove beyond any doubt, that increasing CO2 by 200-400 ppm have significantly improved plant yields by upto 200%. See <a href="http://co2science.org/">CO2science.org</a> I suspect that is the reason why carbon-based lifeforms like us thrive and multiply.

Speaking as a researcher who is working on a book that is partly about global warming, we know that the climate emergency is real, lethal, urgent, and WE caused it. How do we know human activity is the main cause of almost all recent global warming? Here’s how: 1) Burning fossil fuels increased the levels of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide) in the atmosphere and oceans. For the atmosphere, the change was from 280 ppm of CO2 to 415 ppm of CO2—a 48% increase. For the oceans, they absorbed enough excess CO2 to make them 30% more acidic. 2) We know the additional CO2 in the atmosphere was mostly due to human activity because as we burned more and more fossil fuels, the relative proportion of carbon 12/carbon 13 isotopes in the atmosphere gradually shifted towards the ratio produced by burning fossil fuels (2% more Carbon 12). 3) After human activity markedly increased levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases, the lower atmosphere and the oceans got warmer than before--just as the theory of man-made global warming predicted they would. 4) After human activity markedly increased levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases, the upper atmosphere got cooler--just as the theory of man-made global warming predicted it would: This happens because the additional CO2 we added is now trapping more of that heat in the lower atmosphere. 5) After human activity markedly increased levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases, there was an increase in the lower atmosphere of the specific wavelengths of thermal energy that specific greenhouses gases (CO2, methane, nitrous oxide) absorb and re-radiate. Again, this was just what the theory of man-made global warming predicted would happen. 6) As human activity markedly increased levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases, there was a decrease in the upper atmosphere of the specific wavelengths of thermal energy that specific greenhouses gases (CO2, methane, nitrous oxide) absorb and re-radiate. Again, this was just what the theory of man-made global warming predicted would happen. 7) Models of the relationship between levels of greenhouse gases and average global temperatures have predicted global warming with impressive accuracy. https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-how-well-have-climate-models-projected-global-warming 8) Research that takes into consideration the effects of multiple natural factors (sun’s activity, earth’s orbit, etc.) and anthropogenic (man-made) factors on global temperatures has found that the addition of greenhouse gases due to burning fossil fuels caused all of the recent observed warming. Taken together, ALL EIGHT of those pieces of evidence prove conclusively that recent warming was caused by humans burning fossil fuels. In terms of climate science, evidence that strong is like investigating a murder scene and knowing the suspect had motive, opportunity, you know the means of death, the suspect’s fingerprints are on the murder weapon and you have a videotape of him committing the crime. All recent warming and climate disruption is due to us burning fossil fuels. To dip your toes into the evidence, try all three levels of content in the link below, but especially see Figures 4b, c, and d in the “Advanced” level: https://skepticalscience.com/empirical-evidence-for-co2-enhanced-greenhouse-effect-advanced.htm http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2004/12/how-do-we-know-that-recent-cosub2sub-increases-are-due-to-human-activities-updated/ Also see https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jul/24/scientific-consensus-on-humans-causing-global-warming-passes-99 Finally, it’s the SPEED of temperature and CO2 changes which is so lethal to the web of life—TEN TIMES faster than when coming out of an ice age. Most life can’t adapt to the rapid and cascading changes that brings, and our civilization is totally unprepared for the tsunami of rapid and harmful changes coming our way in the next century (but already beginning now). If we stay on the path we are on, that leads towards the degradation and then collapse of ecosystems and thus the collapse of ecosystems, and thus the collapse of our food supply, society, and population. I’m almost 60, have two young adult kids, generally care about people and nature, and wish we didn’t do this, but we did. Happily, there are hundreds of strategies for healing and restoring a healthy balance, but we will need to switch to lifestyles and an economic model that actually obey the limits and laws of nature. That includes a RAPID transition away from burning fossil fuels and simpler lifestyles in wealthy nations (especially for the rich folks whose lifestyles cause by far the most damage). Take care.

We will have cheaper more reliable electricity. Our soldiers will no longer die so we can have gas for our vehicle’s. We will reduce pollution in the air. Our water will become cleaner as time passes for our future descendants. No more peaker plants that cost millions yet only operate a few hours a day. A cost benefit shows less than 10 YEARS ROI.WIND AND SOLAR IS NO LONGER EXPENSIVE ITS THE CHEAPEST SOURCE OF POWER PERIOD. MODERN BATTERIES MEAN STORAGE IS NO LONGER A PROBLEM. Like always the economics will take care of this over time. Almost all new power production is wind and solar because it’s the most economical way to make power. Electric transport is a given by 2030 it will be the dominate mover of people. It’s cheaper it’s more reliable and last longer than any gas powered vehicle’s. It doesn’t matter who is right we must do it because if we are wrong then my 5 grandchildren are doomed. What is your children or grandchildren lives worth? Mine are priceless. Remember the solution will pay for it self so why take a chance. If you Support our troops you must support moving away from fossil fuel. Every soldier that dies or is wounded overseas is because we drive gas cars. The number one source of funding is from oil. So who do you choose to support them or us.

For me the pendulum is swinging towards the idea that the climate is changing, humans have a part in it but that there most likely will be less harm to the environment than if force poverty on people by not allowing efficient sources of energy to people. Rivers in the US were severely polluted 70 years ago as are rivers in 3rd world nations. Allowing these nations to leave poverty will help the environment more than not allowing their use of coal, transitioning to wind and solar like Australia has done and tripling their cost of electricity along with having a system where blackouts occasionally occur thereby causing industry to leave their country. I am Canadian and I really do not want to see the happen here- even though it has happened to an extent in Ontario.

We are releasing more CO2 than Earths vegetation can absorb. You would also know carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas which warms the surface and lower atmosphere. Trying to focus on the short term benefit of global greening is to ignore the problems global warming is bringing us.

Certainly, those of us who do not buy into the man made cause, do not deny the fact that ice caps are melting. What we doubt is the impact of man. They cut off the dates on their charts to exclude back from 1926, which shows warmer temperatures then than now...very convenient.

(THAT we are warming the planet is settled science, and THAT most recent warming (last 60-150 years) was due to human activity is settled science, and the smaller nuances that are still debated about the past and future would not be the point of the debate.

Not all climate scientists agree about anthropogenic climate change. Again, you're proving my point. Climate alarmists, such as yourself, refuse to debate the opposing scientists, especially in a publicly moderated debate. You are doing the exact thing that I've been talking about.

They're right--we're warming the planet and it poses a threat to the future of life on Earth.

How do we know human activity is the main cause of almost all recent global warming? Here’s how: 1) Burning fossil fuels increased the levels of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide) in the atmosphere and oceans. For the atmosphere, the change was from 280 ppm of CO2 to 415 ppm of CO2—a 48% increase. For the oceans, they absorbed enough excess CO2 to make them 30% more acidic. 2) We know the additional CO2 in the atmosphere was mostly due to human activity because as we burned more and more fossil fuels, the relative proportion of carbon 12/carbon 13 isotopes in the atmosphere gradually shifted towards the ratio produced by burning fossil fuels (2% more Carbon 12). 3) After human activity markedly increased levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases, the lower atmosphere and the oceans got warmer than before--just as the theory of man-made global warming predicted they would. 4) After human activity markedly increased levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases, the upper atmosphere got cooler--just as the theory of man-made global warming predicted it would: This happens because the additional CO2 we added is now trapping more of that heat in the lower atmosphere. 5) After human activity markedly increased levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases, there was an increase in the lower atmosphere of the specific wavelengths of thermal energy that specific greenhouses gases (CO2, methane, nitrous oxide) absorb and re-radiate. Again, this was just what the theory of man-made global warming predicted would happen. 6) As human activity markedly increased levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases, there was a decrease in the upper atmosphere of the specific wavelengths of thermal energy that specific greenhouses gases (CO2, methane, nitrous oxide) absorb and re-radiate. Again, this was just what the theory of man-made global warming predicted would happen. 7) Models of the relationship between levels of greenhouse gases and average global temperatures have predicted global warming with impressive accuracy. https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-how-well-have-climate-models-projected-global-warming 8) Research that takes into consideration the effects of multiple natural factors (sun’s activity, earth’s orbit, etc.) and anthropogenic (man-made) factors on global temperatures has found that the addition of greenhouse gases due to burning fossil fuels caused all of the recent observed warming. Taken together, ALL EIGHT of those pieces of evidence prove conclusively that recent warming was caused by humans burning fossil fuels. In terms of climate science, evidence that strong is like investigating a murder scene and knowing the suspect had motive, opportunity, you know the means of death, the suspect’s fingerprints are on the murder weapon and you have a videotape of him committing the crime. All recent warming and climate disruption is due to us burning fossil fuels. To dip your toes into the evidence, try all three levels of content in the link below, but especially see Figures 4b, c, and d in the “Advanced” level: https://skepticalscience.com/empirical-evidence-for-co2-enhanced-greenhouse-effect-advanced.htm http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2004/12/how-do-we-know-that-recent-cosub2sub-increases-are-due-to-human-activities-updated/ Also see https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jul/24/scientific-consensus-on-humans-causing-global-warming-passes-99 Finally, it’s the SPEED of temperature and CO2 changes which is so lethal to the web of life—TEN TIMES faster than when coming out of an ice age. Most life can’t adapt to the rapid and cascading changes that brings, and our civilization is totally unprepared for the tsunami of rapid and harmful changes coming our way in the next century (but already beginning now). If we stay on the path we are on, that leads towards the degradation and then collapse of ecosystems and thus the collapse of ecosystems, and thus the collapse of our food supply, society, and population. I’m almost 60, have two young adult kids, generally care about people and nature, and wish we didn’t do this, but we did. Happily, there are hundreds of strategies for healing and restoring a healthy balance, but we will need to switch to lifestyles and an economic model that actually obey the limits and laws of nature. That includes a RAPID transition away from burning fossil fuels and simpler lifestyles in wealthy nations (especially for the rich folks whose lifestyles cause by far the most damage). Take care.

Never discount terrorism to blow centralized plants up or be controlled by money men who want inflated prices for the energy thus produced. Ideally every electrical item that we have should be self powered by energy from the space time vacuum. If the costs are not socialized by larger groups of people, then greedy bankers shall loan out the required amount, but then charge HUGE sums of interest. The financiers using the bank loan shall want to recoup their investment ASAP so shall mark up the costs each year of operation--as is the usual practice in our inflationary debt-based monetary system. Supposedly when you jolt the ether with EM energy, more energy can be tapped using the "right" kind of physics. Just like complex numbers predict certain electrodynamic situations, an alternate dimensional situation may be at work in these cases. I do not discount anything that free energy from the vacuum proponents claim unless seeking money from me for yet another prototype like that Joseph Newman energy machine guy kept doing his entire life. His stuff was expensive to build too. He had one larger machine that had 4 expensive huge neodymium magnets and about 50 to 60 kilometers of enameled copper wire. It produced slow moving motor torque, and pulsed DC that he used to recharge dead batteries. It may have operated using standing waves in the long drive / pickup coil to not put hardly any drain on the battery used to make the armature turn. https://www.google.com/search?q=free+energy+machine+of+Joseph+Newman&newwindow=1&tbm=vid&sa=X A Japanese manufactured machine used left-handed materials like bismuth and oscillator resonance to extract energy, but the trouble was that if the machines were in close enough proximity to one another, they caused some interference with one another that supposedly the Japanese government determined caused a dangerous situation of some sort so pulled them from the market. Another guy Steven Mark produced a machine that captured ambient Earth 7.8 Hz frequency and could power a few 100 Watt light bulbs until the capturing coil heated up too much after about 10 minutes. https://www.google.com/search?q=free+energy+tpu+steven+mark+jack+durban&newwindow=1&tbm=vid&sa=X A meltdown failure would happen if left on for about 15 minutes. Some means should have been used to use 4 such units, and cycle switch through them. The excess heat could have been tapped to heat water for home use for hot water, etc. The guy tried to trick investors with a relay switch of some kind that turned off the machine if placed upside down. He did not want anyone to know what were the actual operating principles so used such deception. The trouble with greedy men is that they seek out licenses to protect their inventions called patents. The governments of most countries are in huge debts and are essentially a slave to the lender. As such these greedy people use YES MEN to steal the stuff from others that would otherwise cause a paradigm shift of centralized control to de-centralized individual control (freedom from the greedy money men). As such laws are in place that permit the governments to declare that a certain kind of working invention must be sequestered as threatening national security, etc. Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada signed a seizure order for the equipment being used by John Hutchison an amateur physicist-inventor who was living in Vancouver, BC, Canada. His equipment produced unusual effects such as force at a distance, antigravity, molecular transformation of materials such as metals and wood that got intermingled with one another. https://www.google.com/search?newwindow=1&q=%22Brian+Mulroney%22+%22John+Hutchison%22+inventor+confiscation+OR+seizure+lab+18+March+1990 Hutchison's neighbors complained that things in their nearby houses were inexplicably moving by themselves when Hutchison turned on and fiddled around with his experiments.

As for Tony Heller, I know his videos can seem convincing. But part of what I study in my research is propaganda as well as intentionally misleading research studies (and I’m also writing a book that features global warming prominently). Based on that background, it is clear that Tony Heller is spreading blatant propaganda. I’m sure you are smart enough to see through his propaganda once I show you the tricks he is using to fool people. Here’s my de-bunking of the Tony Heller video “My Gift to Climate Alarmists” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8455KEDitpU My main question after watching this video is--Is this guy paid by the fossil fuel interests to cleverly mislead people like this??? Basically, this guy is pretending to inform viewers about how climate scientists supposedly cherry pick data but then he blatantly and cynically cherry picks data to try to fool anyone watching the video. It's cleverly-constructed propaganda, but it's total nonsense. 1) First, he discusses heat waves. GLOBAL warming is about what is happening on average all around the world, but he uses data on US heat waves to try to make it look like there is no relationship between man-made GLOBAL warming and the frequency of heat waves. This is, of course, nonsense. 93.4% of the surface of the Earth is NOT part of America, and as it turns out, when it was very warm in America in the 1930s, most of the rest of the world was much cooler. https://skepticalscience.com/1934-hottest-year-on-record.htm Thus, frequency of heat waves in the US tells us ZERO about the frequency of GLOBAL heat waves. If this guy was serious about informing viewers about whether man-made global warming is increasing the risks of heat waves worldwide, he could have done a ten-second search and found lots of evidence that global warming is making the frequency and severity of heat waves much worse. For example: https://skepticalscience.com/heatwaves-past-global-warming-climate-change-intermediate.htm https://www.yaleclimateconnections.org/2019/06/heat-waves-and-climate-change-is-there-a-connection/ And while we are talking about it, July 2019 was the hottest month in recorded history, with many places shattering their record high temp records. Speaking of horrific heat waves becoming more common, the AVERAGE high temperature for all of Australia on December 17, 2019 was 105.6 degrees. Many places were obviously much warmer. That's insane. 2) Second, he claims that one way to fool people is carefully choose the time frame of the data you discuss to reflect the conclusion you want people to believe, and related to that he critiques climate scientists for using a chart showing how Arctic Sea ice HAS sharply declined from 1979-2017. Then he claims that just showing this 38-year slice of data misleads people about the actual trend. Laughably, to pretend to clear the air, he then shows a 17-year slice of data (1973-1990). He's trying to make viewers believe that he is revealing suspiciously hidden data, and the narrow slice of data he puts in the video makes it look like there's even more Arctic Ice than before. However, notice how he is now cutting off the data in 1990. Why does he do this instead of showing the trend in Arctic Sea ice from 1973-2017/18, or even from 1953-2017? The answer is obvious--he wants to fool you about global warming and its effects. If he showed the whole data set, it would be obvious to all viewers of this video that Arctic Sea ice has dropped dramatically, just as scientists have said. 3) Later, to put a giant cherry on his cherry-picking effort, he picks a single city! in Ohio that happened to have more days above 90 degrees in the distant past than more recently. Then he leaves that on the screen a long time, to reinforce in our brains this idea that temperatures are actually going down, even though they are actually going up. Notice too that he picked one city in the US, a country that happened to have some exceptionally hot days in the 1930s-- a pattern that didn't happen in other parts of the world. Never mind that worldwide AND in the US, due to man-made global warming, record warm temperatures are occurring at higher rates than are record low temperatures. All-time record high temps have also been hit for several nations, sometimes twice in the same summer. http://theconversation.com/why-hot-weather-records-continue-to-tumble-worldwide-86158 https://www.axios.com/heat-records-temperature-climate-change-map-f82a017b-4383-43d0-ae52-42517138b108.html https://time.com/5652972/july-2019-hottest-month/ And never mind that since WWII, as the burning of fossil fuels has taken off, global temps HAVE actually warmed just as climate scientists accurately predicted they would. https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-how-well-have-climate-models-projected-global-warming https://skepticalscience.com/search.php?Search=Predictions_150 Then he shows off his handy dandy software tool, and claims this would be a great tool for climate scientists to fool people, but never telling you how he cleverly cherry-picked start and end dates to fool viewers about the trend in Arctic Sea ice. 4) Then around the 10:00 mark he claims that fighting climate changes is about “overthrowing our government.” That’s hogwash: Fighting climate change is about using the powers of government to protect the Earth, people, and our future, just as fighting World War II was about using the power of government to protect people and our future. On our current trajectory, we are steadily heading towards the collapse of the world’s ecosystems, and if the ecosystems collapse, our economy, our civilization, and the human population all collapse with it. Then he claims “they” had millions of school children out of school to protest the destruction of the climate. Nice try, but it’s mostly schoolchildren who noticed the adults who are supposedly in charge have failed to protect the health of the planet and thus put their futures in jeopardy. Middle school, high school, and college students who have learned how older generations robbed them of a brighter future by plundering the Earth’s wealth and de-stabilizing the climate are angry and scared. And they are right to be angry and scared. And it doesn’t take a Ph.D. in science to figure out that endlessly gobbling up natural resources, endlessly polluting, and endlessly warming the planet is ruining the place. Even many young kids have this figured out. But the grown-ups don’t want to fess up and take responsibility for screwing up: They don’t want to face the fact that our industrialized consumerist capitalist economy is hopelessly and tragically in conflict with the limits and laws of nature. The big propaganda lie that almost everyone has been fooled by is the delusion that industrialized capitalism is a viable system in the long haul. It just isn’t. Take care.

UgxpDoSnCGdC68bzDWV4AaABAg.94Z5ndogapz95vpfEK8LOT		0	2020-03-08 03:51:01	Karl Wheatley	As I taught one of my university classes recently, the long-term harmful effects of rapidly adding much more CO2 include global warming of the land, atmosphere, and especially oceans; rapid and accelerating melting of the Earth’s ice sheets and glaciers, rising sea levels (very slow at first but increasingly catastrophic), growing shortages of freshwater for drinking and irrigation affecting billions of people, more intense droughts, floods, and wildfires; and more air pollution and related human health problems due to more intense forest fires. The overly-optimistic folks who claim that global greening from more CO2 apparently don’t know that with the greening, weeds tend to really benefit, and with the warming you get more harm to crops and forests from insects, fungi, and disease; grain crops have already lost 5-8% or more of key nutrients due to more CO2 and will continue to lose more, and the amount of sugars in grain crops will continue to rise. Lower nutrient content and higher sugar content in our foods just feeds the crisis of obesity and related diseases, driving up health care costs further. Also, more CO2 means plants will grow thicker leaves and need more water due to increased CO2 (this will intensify water shortages as 70-80% of freshwater is used for agriculture/food production). The more intense droughts and floods creates problems for many farmers, and the range where certain crops can be grown efficiently has moved towards the poles by 100 miles or more already: Unfortunately, there is less land near the poles than in the fatter middle of the Earth, and the land up there often hasn’t had time or opportunity (permafrost) to develop really rich topsoil. Thus, while more CO2 can increase crop growth at first, as warming and all the other ripple effects kick in, crops get more stressed and struggle: Thus, a recent study expects 60% of the global wheat crop to be threatened by 2100. More CO2 and the warming it causes also means the spread of human disease as the “tropics” and its mosquito-borne diseases expand by 30 miles a decade, while melting permafrost has unleashed other diseases long-frozen in the ice (e.g., anthrax). Then there’s the warming-caused mass die-offs of coral reefs and the fish and other aquatic life that depend on them, the increasing drying of America from west to east, the slowing of ocean currents with ripple effects for climate (already beginning) and increasing the size of dead zones in the ocean, the collapse of ecosystems on land (permafrost region, drying of the Amazon) and sea (decline/collapse of coral reefs and fish populations, polar ecosystem heading for collapse as “cold-enough” areas disappear), sea snails at the bottom of the food chain having their shells dissolve at much higher rates because of the more acidic oceans, other shellfish having a harder time building shells, and thus being 30-50% smaller than normal), almost all green sea turtles are now being born female (because gender is regulated by the temperature of the sand at that time of year). More CO2 rapid die-offs of species related to the above—including the disappearance of 40% of the plankton population since the 1950s, increasing crop failures due to the above, increasingly-worsening refugees crises due to the above, increasingly staggering mitigation and repair costs due to the above, and increasing political and social instability and violence and resource conflicts/wars (already happening) due to all of the above. The chain reactions are vastly worse than you have ever been told—truly catastrophic in the long run, leading (if we don’t take rapid action) to the collapse of ecosystems, our food supply, and our civilization and population. I don’t know, but I do know that very few scientists know all of these destructively cascading ripple effects because most don’t read much outside of their specialty. P.S. I didn’t even include all of those ripple effects. So, if you are watching videos and reading on websites that “Hey, more CO2 is great—it’s plant food,” I want to know why aren’t these folks aren’t telling you the WHOLE story? Why are they only telling you about 1% of the changes rapidly increasing CO2 levels will cause, and leaving out the other 99%. Is it because they don’t know the whole story? That may be understandable—I only know all this because I’ve been researching for more than 10 years on a book about what we need to do to protect and heal society and the planet. However, some of these harms have been well-publicized, so if these people are scientifically literate, they should know about them. Another possibility regarding some of the site/sources that gleefully declare “CO2 is plant food!” is that they are PAID to spread propaganda like pretending more CO2 is all good news. After all, the fossil fuel companies and some billionaires like the Koch Brothers have been spending a combined $200+ million a year to spread propaganda to confuse people, and they may have funded the folks that provided some of the information you heard. Take care.	UCQJUC_hQh7jNdE3X0oyTOiw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQJUC_hQh7jNdE3X0oyTOiw	1	UgxpDoSnCGdC68bzDWV4AaABAg	Lethal

Speaking as a researcher who is working on a book that is partly about global warming, we know that the climate emergency is real, lethal, urgent, and WE caused it.

Taken together, ALL EIGHT of those pieces of evidence prove conclusively that recent warming was caused by humans burning fossil fuels. In terms of climate science, evidence that strong is like investigating a murder scene and knowing the suspect had motive, opportunity, you know the means of death, the suspect’s fingerprints are on the murder weapon and you have a videotape of him committing the crime. All recent warming and climate disruption is due to us burning fossil fuels. To dip your toes into the evidence, try all three levels of content in the link below, but especially see Figures 4b, c, and d in the “Advanced” level: https://skepticalscience.com/empirical-evidence-for-co2-enhanced-greenhouse-effect-advanced.htm http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2004/12/how-do-we-know-that-recent-cosub2sub-increases-are-due-to-human-activities-updated/ Also see https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jul/24/scientific-consensus-on-humans-causing-global-warming-passes-99 Finally, it’s the SPEED of temperature and CO2 changes which is so lethal to the web of life—TEN TIMES faster than when coming out of an ice age. Most life can’t adapt to the rapid and cascading changes that brings, and our civilization is totally unprepared for the tsunami of rapid and harmful changes coming our way in the next century (but already beginning now). If we stay on the path we are on, that leads towards the degradation and then collapse of ecosystems and thus the collapse of ecosystems, and thus the collapse of our food supply, society, and population. I’m almost 60, have two young adult kids, generally care about people and nature, and wish we didn’t do this, but we did. Happily, there are hundreds of strategies for healing and restoring a healthy balance, but we will need to switch to lifestyles and an economic model that actually obey the limits and laws of nature. That includes a RAPID transition away from burning fossil fuels and simpler lifestyles in wealthy nations (especially for the rich folks whose lifestyles cause by far the most damage). Take care.

This is because green plants breath IN co-2 and breath OUT oxygen. Google searching a few months ago I found the parts per million of co-2 where certain green plants die was between 150 and 250 ppm. Supposedly, evergreen trees evolved at a time when the atmosphere had an enormous amount of CO-2, many multiples of what we have today, and so would die off first.<br />Propaganda lies omit telling everyone that water vapor is the number one greenhouse gas:<br />so what are you going to do, eject all the waters of the oceans into outer space in order to make it colder?<br />The length of an ICE age is very long (80,000 to 100,000 years), but the length of an intra glacial period is a short time of about 10,000 years. This 10,000 year span of time is approximately the amount of time that it took to rebuild civilization from the prior ICE age where most plants and animals&#39; food was under about 2 miles thick ICE sheets that covered the continents.<br />Historians looking at the old testament bible and the Noah story believe that the flood came as a result of the melting ICE sheets when the melting edge finally gave way and released the giant puddle that had accumulated continent wide that caused a giant tsunami that washed over the planet causing flood conditions around the world. What would a 2 mile high tsunami wave look like coming toward you? <br />The climate models use math. A term in math is either added or subtracted. A factor multiplies or divides. A cycle uses an oscillation like a sine or cosine or other periodic function.<br />The models used existing electronic circuit differential equation models that describe an oscillator circuit. Those electric circuits have a feedback system. Such feedback can happen if a public address amplifier is set too loudly and a microphone input is subjected to hearing a slightly delayed version of its own input sound. This can result in a loud squealing tone that can drowned out the person&#39;s voice who is trying to give a speech. To stop the feedback the system gain must be reduced appropriately or the microphone has to be isolated from the PA loud speaker&#39;s sound a lot more. <br />There are all kinds of influences that govern what water vapor does such as cloud formation. Thick rainstorm clouds block most of the sun. The shadow cast by thick cloud is cooler. By influencing cloud formation or non-formation, it can cool or not the surface level air.<br /><a href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=weathertec+%22dr+helmut+fluhrer%22+OR+technology+OR+services&amp;tbm=isch">https://www.google.ca/search?q=weathertec+%22dr+helmut+fluhrer%22+OR+technology+OR+services&amp;tbm=isch</a><br />It was found more than a decade ago that atmospheric ionization via radio wave energy could force rainstorms to happen OR NOT depending on the ionization polarity. When a rainstorm happens, it necessarily significantly reduces atmospheric water vapor present. When such technology is used to remove water vapor from the air, the night time clear skies shall readily permit the accumulated surface temperature heat to escape into OUTER SPACE that can sink an unlimited amount of such heat.<br />The solar system is situated in the Milky Way galaxy. The galaxy has the solar system orbiting the galactic center. The geographic North pole now points to Polaris, the North star, but in the past it pointed to other stars. Various motions cause this polar wobble to happen every 25,570 years or so. Each such period is called an age.<br /><a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=age+of+aquarius+precession+of+the+equinox">https://www.bing.com/search?q=age+of+aquarius+precession+of+the+equinox</a><br />A long time ago pagans worshiped the bull--torus. Then they worshiped the next zodiac symbol, etc. Aquarius is another zodiac symbol of the water bearer. In the 1960s they sang the song of the dawning of the age of Aquarius. We were going from the age of Pisces to Aquarius.<br />The sun spot cycle is about 11 years.<br />Every few million years the magnetic poles of Earth switch with one another.<br />There are spiral arms to the galaxy. These rotate. A few years ago, 2009 to 2012 a man posited that the galactic center that emits the spiral arms produces an immense amount of radiation even from that distance away and that the Earth would have a bad exposure to this radiation for a length of time of several thousand years. This radiation, he said, would disrupt all electronics to make them all not work.<br />Cosmic radiation and solar magnetic fields interact with the atmosphere of Earth to help make clouds or help prevent clouds depending on other factors.<br />2015 Dr. Freeman Dyson--According to a genius level math and physics old professor at Princeton University, one of the smartest people on the planet, the climate models are too simplistic because they deliberately do not take into account hardly any of the natural influences of climate. To make up for this inaccuracy, alarmist scientists largely augment the influence made by the CO-2 factors. It is a Fudge Factor.<br />Humans have not been taking world wide climate readings for a long enough time to know more about all of the natural cycles involved. From what I&#39;ve seen the current crop of climate scientists have formed their own religious cult and shun / stifle / banish those with whom they disagree. This method of arguing and winning is a huge fallacy that shall lead to ruin of everyone on the planet should they be misguided by those who have funded this entire exercise for whatever overall purpose.

NO, Mount Pinatubo only emitted 50 MILLION tons of CO2, and it actually had a net cooling effect because it also emitted aerosols. https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2017/06/06/how-much-co2-does-a-single-volcano-emit/#402c8c1c5cbf https://www.climate.gov/news-features/climate-qa/which-emits-more-carbon-dioxide-volcanoes-or-human-activities Planting more trees is one of the most powerful of the hundreds of actions humans must take, but reforesting an area the size of the US only sequesters 10% of all the excess CO2 we added to the system (200 Gt vs. 2,000 Gt), and only does so over a long stretch of time. In the meantime, we are adding 40 Gt per year, meaning that whole reforestation effort only offsets 5 years of our excess emissions. The heal and cool the planet, the whole economy must go carbon negative AND we need to slash meat consumption, retrofit houses, plant a trillion trees, drive and fly much less, etc. Our entire economy is hopelessly out of whack with the limits and laws of nature and either we fundamentally transform it or ecosystems will continue to collapse--as will our food supply.

Their incomes are completely dependent upon globalist government funding of their research that was structured / mandated to only study man's effects on climate and to completely discount natural cycles. The smartest scientists on the planet taught the current crop of IDIOTS supposedly what they are supposed to know. Former members of the IPCC have withdrawn their names from the reports. There is a growing disconnect between the politics of the IPCC and the science. There was warming, but it was not catastrophic. Let me know when Greenland is green again and grape vineyards have been replanted as per the time of the Viking exploration of that region. Where I am in Canada it is certainly not a warm place. However in the summer months I have seen no huge changes in the temperature during my lifetime. https://www.google.com/search?newwindow=1&q=desertification+ted+talk+Allan+Savory+youtube The terrestrial desertification that directly causes warming was caused by mankind to be sure and it was done in the last 300 years or so. Desertification kills off massive numbers of green plant life such as trees that capture and hold CO-2, and replaces them with hot sandy deserts where the soil contains no means to retain rain water from precipitation--water vapor, being the number one greenhouse gas would warm the planet also. This desertification has lead to all affected wildlife from these places becoming endangered or extinct. The NASA and NOAA historical temperature records have been tampered with by editing out various reporting places that showed just how hot it was in the 1930s. Older scientists who still have the computer data of prior copies of the temperature record are easily able to show graphically the difference in temperature graphs that these ground station temperature records have made on the "newer editions" of this temperature record where the 1930s now appear to be much colder. It is ALL A SCAM to get carbon offset pricing of polluters to mark up the prices of their goods and services. The winner for carbon credits exchanges is none other than Al Gore himself who just knew his scam would be forced upon the uninitiated masses to scam entire populations into paying more taxes and for inflated prices on goods and services. The guy who says that the models do not have enough terms and factors involved to be more accurate at predicting global temperatures is that retired guy who, for all I know has died, and so holds no value from fossil fuel companies. The companies profiting from this fabricated global warming crisis are being run by the likes of Al Gore. The processes deep in the earth's core or crust that created the carbon in the first place stopped several hundred thousand years ago. With this cessation of carbon creation, the existing carbon in our system is systemically being isolated by being captured / buried. To break this capturing, man has recently tapped into these buried sources to counteract this isolation process. It is said that were it not for mankind digging the carbon up and putting it back in circulation, the green plants would have much less CO-2 to produce oxygen for us and other animals to keep breathing. https://youtu.be/sXxktLAsBPo Dr. Patrick Moore - A Dearth of Carbon? https://youtu.be/BiKfWdXXfIs Freeman Dyson on the Global Warming Hysteria April, 2015	UCwophQpbq8QnUeKy8fK8t0A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwophQpbq8QnUeKy8fK8t0A	1	Ugx_q1uzIFfgEnSj_Wt4AaABAg	oldspammer

Snow stayed around too long. When it suddenly melted, there was massive flooding." The issue at hand is GLOBAL warming, so it doesn't matter how cold it was where you are, the question is the AVERAGE temperature all over the Earth all throughout the year, and we are driving that average temp up rapidly. But if you are like like the Midwest or Europe, you just had the warmest winter perhaps ever--which is consistent with the warming trend. "In the early 1990s Mount Pinatubo erupted over a 2 year period placing more CO-2 into the atmosphere than all the history of mankind up until last night." That's totally false, and you need to stop trusting whoever is feeding you lies such as that. Pinatubo released 50 million tons, but humans add around 40 BILLION tons to the Earth's atmosphere and oceans every year, about 800 times the Pinatubo eruption. In other words, normal human activity will add more atmospheric CO2 to the Earth between noon and 11 pm tomorrow night than did the Mount Pinatubo eruption. But unlike that eruption, we keep adding it hour after hour, day after day, and year after year. Please get yourself more trustworthy sources of information: Human activity is steadily destroying the web of life, and time is starting to run out for us to heal the damage we have caused.

Not true, we have data going back hundreds of thousands of years. We KNOW more CO2 creates more warming--you can model it in an elementary school science experiment, and as my earlier post shared, we have compelling evidence the warming occurred because of US burning fossil fuels. Our fingerprints are all over the murder weapon, so to speak. And the idea natural cycles aren't take into account is total fiction brought to you by the people being paid millions of dollars a year to fool people about global warming. Take care.

When it suddenly melted, there was massive flooding. Greenhouses use about 1200 ppm co-2 for accelerating growth. CO-2 in upper atmosphere prevents warming. Satellite photos over the many years that we have had them shows the increased greening. Study as much as you can who really controls the world. Globalism has been a force for a very long time. If certain people stand in their way, those people are summarily taken out via murder or imprisonment or blacklisting. The Club of Rome started in the late 1960s had the goal of depopulating the planet by blaming all ills on over population of the planet by humans. They said that pollution and global warming were the new thing. It fits with the report from Iron Mountain that a replacement for wars in peace time had to be found--it was pollution from what I can recall. However, the rates of birth in Western capitalist countries has been on a drastic decline for about 60 years from what is being taught in the Prussian school system that we have now where we are told what to think rather than how to think using a classical liberal arts education that uses critical thinking. In the early 1990s Mount Pinatubo erupted over a 2 year period placing more CO-2 into the atmosphere than all the history of mankind up until last night. Since the early 2000s man has had the technology to use electromagnetic radiation to cause polarized ionization of various layers of the atmosphere to cause or prevent rainfall / thunderstorms. https://www.google.com/search?newwindow=1&q=weathertec+company+technology&tbm=isch The company changed its name and was featured in a Middle Eastern Business Journal as being able to cause rainstorms during the dry season a very large percentage of the time. By having thick dark black clouds during the day time and clear skies at night by cycling these machines for a given regional area, the temperature could be made to drop about 18 degrees C or so because the dark skies in the day time would completely block out the sun from warming the surface, then the clear skies at night would let all accumulated heat escape into outer space. https://www.google.com/search?newwindow=1&q=swiss+company+metro+systems+artificial+rainstorms There is no question in my mind that globalists want total domination, and that humans are affecting weather, just not in the benign ways that even the climate scientists realize. If they want to tax the uninitiated masses via trickery, the tools are at their disposal to steer the Jet Stream in the direction that they want, and increase or decrease temperatures over vast regions of the planet via geoengineering and weather modification technologies. Because the number one greenhouse gas is water vapor, what are you going to do: send all the waters of the ocean into outer space? The reason that CO-2 has reduced effects is that its absorption and emission spectrum overlaps that of water vapor. As the ice melts and water rises, there shall be more water vapor in the atmosphere, and hence more rainfall, and hence available fresh water from precipitation into lakes, rivers, streams, etc. China in the Paris accords has been given a free hand to have as many coal fired power stations as it wants to build because it was declared a "developing" nation. This status was entirely caused by communism and communism was fostered by globalists in the US State department who came from the Rockefeller foundation. Take a look at the arguments presented by Alex Epstein about petroleum as a fuel. If someone very profoundly immoral enacts legislation to do it, they shall indirectly cause death and starvation of most humans on the planet.

Ugx_q1uzIFfgEnSj_Wt4AaABAg.94NF1zxsK5N95vqG3Y4U5A		0	2020-03-08 03:56:11	Karl Wheatley	As I taught one of my university classes recently, the long-term harmful effects of rapidly adding much more CO2 include global warming of the land, atmosphere, and especially oceans; rapid and accelerating melting of the Earth’s ice sheets and glaciers, rising sea levels (very slow at first but increasingly catastrophic), growing shortages of freshwater for drinking and irrigation affecting billions of people, more intense droughts, floods, and wildfires; and more air pollution and related human health problems due to more intense forest fires. The overly-optimistic folks who claim that global greening from more CO2 apparently don’t know that with the greening, weeds tend to really benefit, and with the warming you get more harm to crops and forests from insects, fungi, and disease; grain crops have already lost 5-8% or more of key nutrients due to more CO2 and will continue to lose more, and the amount of sugars in grain crops will continue to rise. Lower nutrient content and higher sugar content in our foods just feeds the crisis of obesity and related diseases, driving up health care costs further. Also, more CO2 means plants will grow thicker leaves and need more water due to increased CO2 (this will intensify water shortages as 70-80% of freshwater is used for agriculture/food production). The more intense droughts and floods creates problems for many farmers, and the range where certain crops can be grown efficiently has moved towards the poles by 100 miles or more already: Unfortunately, there is less land near the poles than in the fatter middle of the Earth, and the land up there often hasn’t had time or opportunity (permafrost) to develop really rich topsoil. Thus, while more CO2 can increase crop growth at first, as warming and all the other ripple effects kick in, crops get more stressed and struggle: Thus, a recent study expects 60% of the global wheat crop to be threatened by 2100. More CO2 and the warming it causes also means the spread of human disease as the “tropics” and its mosquito-borne diseases expand by 30 miles a decade, while melting permafrost has unleashed other diseases long-frozen in the ice (e.g., anthrax). Then there’s the warming-caused mass die-offs of coral reefs and the fish and other aquatic life that depend on them, the increasing drying of America from west to east, the slowing of ocean currents with ripple effects for climate (already beginning) and increasing the size of dead zones in the ocean, the collapse of ecosystems on land (permafrost region, drying of the Amazon) and sea (decline/collapse of coral reefs and fish populations, polar ecosystem heading for collapse as “cold-enough” areas disappear), sea snails at the bottom of the food chain having their shells dissolve at much higher rates because of the more acidic oceans, other shellfish having a harder time building shells, and thus being 30-50% smaller than normal), almost all green sea turtles are now being born female (because gender is regulated by the temperature of the sand at that time of year). More CO2 rapid die-offs of species related to the above—including the disappearance of 40% of the plankton population since the 1950s, increasing crop failures due to the above, increasingly-worsening refugees crises due to the above, increasingly staggering mitigation and repair costs due to the above, and increasing political and social instability and violence and resource conflicts/wars (already happening) due to all of the above. The chain reactions are vastly worse than you have ever been told—truly catastrophic in the long run, leading (if we don’t take rapid action) to the collapse of ecosystems, our food supply, and our civilization and population. I don’t know, but I do know that very few scientists know all of these destructively cascading ripple effects because most don’t read much outside of their specialty. P.S. I didn’t even include all of those ripple effects. So, if you are watching videos and reading on websites that “Hey, more CO2 is great—it’s plant food,” I want to know why aren’t these folks aren’t telling you the WHOLE story? Why are they only telling you about 1% of the changes rapidly increasing CO2 levels will cause, and leaving out the other 99%. Is it because they don’t know the whole story? That may be understandable—I only know all this because I’ve been researching for more than 10 years on a book about what we need to do to protect and heal society and the planet. However, some of these harms have been well-publicized, so if these people are scientifically literate, they should know about them. Another possibility regarding some of the site/sources that gleefully declare “CO2 is plant food!” is that they are PAID to spread propaganda like pretending more CO2 is all good news. After all, the fossil fuel companies and some billionaires like the Koch Brothers have been spending a combined $200+ million a year to spread propaganda to confuse people, and they may have funded the folks that provided some of the information you heard. Take care.	UCQJUC_hQh7jNdE3X0oyTOiw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQJUC_hQh7jNdE3X0oyTOiw	1	Ugx_q1uzIFfgEnSj_Wt4AaABAg	oldspammer

You add CO2 to the system, it holds in more of the thermal energy that comes from the lights energy that the sun bombards the Earth with every day. The "greenhouse" effect works as predicted and climate scientists clearly have it worked out pretty well since models of the relationship between levels of greenhouse gases and average global temperatures have predicted global warming with impressive accuracy. https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-how-well-have-climate-models-projected-global-warming So, speaking as a researcher who is working on a book that is partly about global warming, we know that the climate emergency is real, lethal, urgent, and WE caused it.

I&#39;m in agreement that humans aren&#39;t the major contributor to the warming of our climate but Mother Nature is. Earth does not care about humans and its impact on her. If she wants to create a workd change immediately, she can and will and we&#39;re powerless when that does happen. For example, look at the data on one volcanic eruption and how much green house gasses and destruction it will put out compared to 200 hundred years of human output of the samething. Imagine if several eruptions with earthquakes happened at the same time in different parts of the world? We&#39;ll be screwed.

Link below for proof. <br /><br />2012 Climate Scientist revealed a research that during the time of the dinosaurs carbon in the atmosphere was somewhere between 5 to 15 times more carbon than it is today. None of their fears of runaway greenhouse gases have never came true. <br /><br />This is as close to accurate as you can get on the research. What the climate scientist did was they carbon dated resin from tree sap and then they tested the air bubbles inside. They tested 500 air bubbles during the times of the dinosaurs and all the air bubbles shown that there were more than 5 to 15 times more carbon in the atmosphere during the time of the dinosaurs than today. <br /><br />There has never been a geologist to showing the history of a worldwide floor or mass extinctions because of carbon in the atmosphere which results in runaway greenhouse gases. It is a piece of crap horrible theory that is not true! <br /><br />Why am I skeptical about the Climate Skeptics you might ask? Because they never use the climate scientist on research in the link below about more carbon in the atmosphere than today! They always make their case on the climate scientist on premises of which their premises are crap! The skeptics are always making arguments justifying the climate scientist ridicules claims!!!<br /><br />With all that said I am totally for clean water and clean air! The next vehicle I will buy is going to be a Tesla! But you will never get rid of coal and petroleum unless nuclear power is perfected. If we’re going to have millions of electric cars on the road in each country then there has to be a lot of power. Unfortunately windmills and solar panels are not going to do it!!!

Speaking as a researcher who is working on a book that is partly about global warming, we know that the climate emergency is real, lethal, urgent, and WE caused it. How do we know human activity is the main cause of almost all recent global warming? Here’s how: 1) Burning fossil fuels increased the levels of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide) in the atmosphere and oceans. For the atmosphere, the change was from 280 ppm of CO2 to 415 ppm of CO2—a 48% increase. For the oceans, they absorbed enough excess CO2 to make them 30% more acidic. 2) We know the additional CO2 in the atmosphere was mostly due to human activity because as we burned more and more fossil fuels, the relative proportion of carbon 12/carbon 13 isotopes in the atmosphere gradually shifted towards the ratio produced by burning fossil fuels (2% more Carbon 12). 3) After human activity markedly increased levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases, the lower atmosphere and the oceans got warmer than before--just as the theory of man-made global warming predicted they would. 4) After human activity markedly increased levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases, the upper atmosphere got cooler--just as the theory of man-made global warming predicted it would: This happens because the additional CO2 we added is now trapping more of that heat in the lower atmosphere. 5) After human activity markedly increased levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases, there was an increase in the lower atmosphere of the specific wavelengths of thermal energy that specific greenhouses gases (CO2, methane, nitrous oxide) absorb and re-radiate. Again, this was just what the theory of man-made global warming predicted would happen. 6) As human activity markedly increased levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases, there was a decrease in the upper atmosphere of the specific wavelengths of thermal energy that specific greenhouses gases (CO2, methane, nitrous oxide) absorb and re-radiate. Again, this was just what the theory of man-made global warming predicted would happen. 7) Models of the relationship between levels of greenhouse gases and average global temperatures have predicted global warming with impressive accuracy. https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-how-well-have-climate-models-projected-global-warming 8) Research that takes into consideration the effects of multiple natural factors (sun’s activity, earth’s orbit, etc.) and anthropogenic (man-made) factors on global temperatures has found that the addition of greenhouse gases due to burning fossil fuels caused all of the recent observed warming. Taken together, ALL EIGHT of those pieces of evidence prove conclusively that recent warming was caused by humans burning fossil fuels. In terms of climate science, evidence that strong is like investigating a murder scene and knowing the suspect had motive, opportunity, you know the means of death, the suspect’s fingerprints are on the murder weapon and you have a videotape of him committing the crime. All recent warming and climate disruption is due to us burning fossil fuels. To dip your toes into the evidence, try all three levels of content in the link below, but especially see Figures 4b, c, and d in the “Advanced” level: https://skepticalscience.com/empirical-evidence-for-co2-enhanced-greenhouse-effect-advanced.htm http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2004/12/how-do-we-know-that-recent-cosub2sub-increases-are-due-to-human-activities-updated/ Also see https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jul/24/scientific-consensus-on-humans-causing-global-warming-passes-99 Finally, it’s the SPEED of temperature and CO2 changes which is so lethal to the web of life—TEN TIMES faster than when coming out of an ice age. Most life can’t adapt to the rapid and cascading changes that brings, and our civilization is totally unprepared for the tsunami of rapid and harmful changes coming our way in the next century (but already beginning now). If we stay on the path we are on, that leads towards the degradation and then collapse of ecosystems and thus the collapse of ecosystems, and thus the collapse of our food supply, society, and population. I’m almost 60, have two young adult kids, generally care about people and nature, and wish we didn’t do this, but we did. Happily, there are hundreds of strategies for healing and restoring a healthy balance, but we will need to switch to lifestyles and an economic model that actually obey the limits and laws of nature. That includes a RAPID transition away from burning fossil fuels and simpler lifestyles in wealthy nations (especially for the rich folks whose lifestyles cause by far the most damage). Take care.

Don&#39;t equate the two.<br /><br />Also, the complaint I here from those on the side of Climate Change scientists is usually the ones preaching won&#39;t come to the debates they invite them to. It seems counter productive to blame them for that, if the opposition is not going to show up. And it is somewhat career suicide in this environment, so I wish for this to happen.<br /><br />Now, why do you assume if the climate rising is a bad thing? We have had times in the past, around about 10,000 years ago, when the temperature was 2-3 degrees higher than it is now, and during that time, the deserts we know today were green, and the tundra in Canada had more life. <br /><br />Keep in mind, the thing that has a higher effect on temperature is H2O, but we can&#39;t really model liquid cloud so Climate Change Scientist focus on something they can model, and just hand wave about water. Well, we will have more rain thanks to the ice melting, the clouds will cool the planet, blocking the suns rays from ever getting in, creating an equilibrium between the two.<br /><br />So, business opportunity? Yes, go create farms out in the desserts, the ones closest to the equator. This solves our food problems around the world, creates jobs and raises the economy in those areas.<br /><br />That was the cliff notes version of the best Climate Science talk I had heard, made from Dr Patrick Moore, one of the founders of Greenpeace.

A warming of the earth of even the slightest amounts has massive consequences for us tiny organisms that live on the crust. The warmer the oceans are means there will be more humidity in the air and atmosphere. The warmer and more humid the world is the more the phenomenon that we call &quot;natural disasters&quot; because it affects us negatively, will get ever more frequent and violent. Just like how cyclones get larger over warmer waters. The cold and heat extremeties will intensify as a result of the earth regulating itself differently to how humans have evolved to find comfortable. Eventually this will lead to an earth that cannot be inhabited by humans without technology assisting in a very significant way. Bottom line is we don&#39;t want that future and it is unnecessary if we can innovate ways to get energy that is not finite and limited a.k.a renewable we can at least hold that future back a few more centuries.

Once they say something like, &quot;we&#39;ve only got 12 years left&quot;, alarm bells go off. That is baseless and totally alarmist. If they have to resort to that, rather than proof and evidence, then there is something wrong with what they&#39;re selling. There was the climategate thing at East Anglia University during the climate accords. There was them changing the name from &quot;warming&quot; to &quot;change&quot; because the earth was not &quot;warming&quot; as they said it would. Yet, with the new terminology every time the weather changes or there is a storm of any kind they can call &quot;climate change&#39; It was a brilliant evolution for them so they can use all weather toward their ends. The actual founder of the weather channel does not believe in it. And the big question is not whether the climate changes but is it really all caused by man. In the 70&#39;s they said we were going to enter a new ice age. Over thousands of years, temperatures will have trends in both directions for periods of time, maybe 50-100 years, then back the other way. That is not surprising when considered over the millions of years on the timeline for Earths existence. But just like Dennis Prager said to you, these are unwise people who have a strong emotional commitment to this ideology. Don&#39;t plants do better with more CO2? If all the shit put into the atmosphere over the past 30 years still has not moved the temperature needle to what they said would happen. Then just how much change in the other direction is possible if we cut back a little? Not much I&#39;d say.	UCCk5qLT6AC1Gw5Bwwfib4Bw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCk5qLT6AC1Gw5Bwwfib4Bw	0

It&#39;s a natural cycle boys and girls.	UCKLbzUnX0IBSHxjYblHUweQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKLbzUnX0IBSHxjYblHUweQ	0

Why do Rich people still invest in the most expensive real estate on the waterline...and why are banks insuring these properties if the planet is going underwater in 12 years...It&#39;s bunk. As much as this guy is trying to talk both sides, the atmospheric physicists have shown us the hockey stick model is really bad math, and none of the catastrophes have happened. We&#39;ve had more C02 concentrations on parts of the planet during the medieval warm period than we have now, and that was when there were no cars and NO industry. What&#39;s more, scientists have proven that C02 is NOT the control mechanism for temperatures...that right there throws the man-made premise out the window. The climate change mantra is that of the regressive left and they&#39;ve made it political so now if you even question it you get canceled, WHY? Because the Left&#39;s goal has always been to bring Socialism and Government regulations and control in the guise of environmentalism.

Speaking as a researcher who is working on a book that is partly about global warming, we know that the climate emergency is real, lethal, urgent, and WE caused it. How do we know human activity is the main cause of almost all recent global warming? Here’s how: 1) Burning fossil fuels increased the levels of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide) in the atmosphere and oceans. For the atmosphere, the change was from 280 ppm of CO2 to 415 ppm of CO2—a 48% increase. For the oceans, they absorbed enough excess CO2 to make them 30% more acidic. 2) We know the additional CO2 in the atmosphere was mostly due to human activity because as we burned more and more fossil fuels, the relative proportion of carbon 12/carbon 13 isotopes in the atmosphere gradually shifted towards the ratio produced by burning fossil fuels (2% more Carbon 12). 3) After human activity markedly increased levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases, the lower atmosphere and the oceans got warmer than before--just as the theory of man-made global warming predicted they would. 4) After human activity markedly increased levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases, the upper atmosphere got cooler--just as the theory of man-made global warming predicted it would: This happens because the additional CO2 we added is now trapping more of that heat in the lower atmosphere. 5) After human activity markedly increased levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases, there was an increase in the lower atmosphere of the specific wavelengths of thermal energy that specific greenhouses gases (CO2, methane, nitrous oxide) absorb and re-radiate. Again, this was just what the theory of man-made global warming predicted would happen. 6) As human activity markedly increased levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases, there was a decrease in the upper atmosphere of the specific wavelengths of thermal energy that specific greenhouses gases (CO2, methane, nitrous oxide) absorb and re-radiate. Again, this was just what the theory of man-made global warming predicted would happen. 7) Models of the relationship between levels of greenhouse gases and average global temperatures have predicted global warming with impressive accuracy. https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-how-well-have-climate-models-projected-global-warming 8) Research that takes into consideration the effects of multiple natural factors (sun’s activity, earth’s orbit, etc.) and anthropogenic (man-made) factors on global temperatures has found that the addition of greenhouse gases due to burning fossil fuels caused all of the recent observed warming. Taken together, ALL EIGHT of those pieces of evidence prove conclusively that recent warming was caused by humans burning fossil fuels. In terms of climate science, evidence that strong is like investigating a murder scene and knowing the suspect had motive, opportunity, you know the means of death, the suspect’s fingerprints are on the murder weapon and you have a videotape of him committing the crime. All recent warming and climate disruption is due to us burning fossil fuels. To dip your toes into the evidence, try all three levels of content in the link below, but especially see Figures 4b, c, and d in the “Advanced” level: https://skepticalscience.com/empirical-evidence-for-co2-enhanced-greenhouse-effect-advanced.htm http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2004/12/how-do-we-know-that-recent-cosub2sub-increases-are-due-to-human-activities-updated/ Also see https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jul/24/scientific-consensus-on-humans-causing-global-warming-passes-99 Finally, it’s the SPEED of temperature and CO2 changes which is so lethal to the web of life—TEN TIMES faster than when coming out of an ice age. Most life can’t adapt to the rapid and cascading changes that brings, and our civilization is totally unprepared for the tsunami of rapid and harmful changes coming our way in the next century (but already beginning now). If we stay on the path we are on, that leads towards the degradation and then collapse of ecosystems and thus the collapse of ecosystems, and thus the collapse of our food supply, society, and population. I’m almost 60, have two young adult kids, generally care about people and nature, and wish we didn’t do this, but we did. Happily, there are hundreds of strategies for healing and restoring a healthy balance, but we will need to switch to lifestyles and an economic model that actually obey the limits and laws of nature. That includes a RAPID transition away from burning fossil fuels and simpler lifestyles in wealthy nations (especially for the rich folks whose lifestyles cause by far the most damage). Take care.

Regardless of man made or not climate change will increase sea levels and will make high populated low elevation areas most valunerable. Easiest way to comprehend is.. the farther you get from the equator the colder it is until you get to the poles where it is below freezing all year round. 1 degree is the difference between 32 F and 33 F and all that polar ice that resides in that newly 33 area will start melting.. even if this only affects 1/2 a mile of polar ice to receed and melt every few years it<br />Would impact the world coastlines. Whether man made or not i think by the time we figure this all out the world may look different. People say by 2050 the world will end and stuff but i see it more as a gradual change over many generations until people don&#39;t remember what the earth weather and climates used to be like here in the present. For instance maybe parts of NYC will be under water in 200 years but the modern engineering to keep the ocean out may keep up with it for a very long time just being tested a lil more every 10 or so years.

They also call you a loon for not listening to scientists yet theres plenty of climate scientists who either call it bullshit or exaggeratted.

A man who revolutionised quantum mechanics with Richard Feiman and a math genuis telling you the math is wrong and people dont listen.<br /><br />Im happy to listen to both sides, Potholer does some great videos on climate scientists who believe and push the climate change agenda, and pointing out those who misuse their research. And on the other side SupiciousObservers and the Thunderbolts team like showing the research on the energy that comes out of the sun, cloud models etc.<br /><br />To be clear both of the above say its happening but both attribute different percentages to what mankind contributes vs nature	UCi89_sQ-QMxr-pF2HfoEBhQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi89_sQ-QMxr-pF2HfoEBhQ	0

However, it's the only one I know of, and that's out of 12.5 million professors worldwide, so the claim that there's some widespread conspiracy because maybe some administrator at one university did or didn't make a dumb decision just doesn't hold water. Also, there is quite a lot of good research implicating global warming and ocean acidification if coral die-off.For example, : https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1081-y.epdf?referrer_access_token=sfpuNWa-DMf01YNwaDJI4NRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0Mc8kEKyqiAaZ1hkI65AB6m--1mwhRHDFM-d3uYjJakv-Oa6f470L3SePO6YvrfpxuBHcloNaPyhPejpFKeiwFB6xlvnMDwmAJxT6L8oTUrUZDDVsUnfUpMT7llE1iis9lNDCWb9GcOb7g-mycmrXPY4cdkK3scrHWmy_Nl_zvAysBfLquwYDH8rz5qJ-0zAQH1_yrBBUyCh8jMqPaLSSD4Rrkj8QEKqX2rOQeSoaTZHHknkZYPs8eCSiy2YKFc3Tg%3D&tracking_referrer=www.pbs.org https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/03/04/devastating-great-barrier-reef-danger-catastrophic-bleaching-temperatures-australia So, while I don't know the particulars of his case, whether or not other pollution is involved sustained warming and ocean acidification are expected to kill off most or all coral reefs by the end of the century unless humanity changes course.

I am in Australia, he is an academic that worked for James Cook university, which is in northern Australia and is heavily involved in marine science. He pointed out all the rubbish that was claimed in marine science about global warming and the Great Barrier Reef. He pointed out that a lot of the research could not be replicated (results that cannot be reproduced are not science). For this he got fired for bringing his peers into disrepute. He ended up winning a lawsuit for wrongful dismissal and was awarded A$1.2 million in damages but remains unemployed to this day as no university will dare touch him. The university (James Cook University) is a major beneficiary of federal funding for research into the implications of global warming on the barrier reef, so the university had a clear financial interest in shooting the messenger (in this case,sounding the alarm on the quality of research). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Ridd https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/sep/06/peter-ridd-awarded-12m-in-unfair-dismissal-case-against-james-cook-university I am sure there are many other similar examples.

That's simply not true. A tenured professor can publish or say whatever they want to. You are consuming conspiracy theories from people who themselves are probably being paid to mislead you. Fossil fuel companies and billionaires are dumping around $200 million a year into propaganda to fool people about the climate. "There is a huge amount of research that is required if global warming is real as everything in society has to be reconfigured. " The research has been done, the scientific debate is over. We know we are doing it, even the investment companies who fund fossil fuels know man-made global warming is real, even Exxon's own scientists published papers and models showing that burning fossils fuels warms the environment and quite accurately predicting how much it would warm if we burned the amount of fossil fuels we have burned. You can run a children's science fair experiment to show how adding more CO2 to a container makes it warm up faster under a light source than does one without the added CO2. This is settled science.

Building construction in the past 60 years has shifted because of mechanical cooling/heating of buildings. Next the population numbers... yes more might have died but what percentage of the population? 1 of 100 is 1% 100 of 10,000 is still 1%... alot of this topic revolves around emotions.

That&#39;s why ALL climate change articles base their hysterics on the &quot;increase in temp in the LAST 50 YEARS&quot;.<br /><br />I believe in climate change, but I don&#39;t believe CO2 is the biggest/only culprit. I believe humans have an effect, but I don&#39;t believe our impact is as large as they say. If you google IPCC climate models, they have around 20-50 models essentially predicting anywhere from not much will happen to hell on earth. That&#39;s like you asking me, is it gonna rain tomorrow, and I say, &quot;it might, it might not&quot;. That means I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen. <br /><br />Humans don&#39;t like not being in control. Climate change, for the large part is beyond our control. That&#39;s what the hysteria is about. Let&#39;s focus ont he real issue: plastics in our oceans, deforestation, etc...

Exactly, but the term had been chosen by one side to then call the other side “climate change deniers” to shut down debate. When neither side is debating that point. It is a useless term. 2. Cite your sources. No model or prediction by those making that the claim that man is “significantly causing the rate of warming” has proven true. 3. Wrong, as the claims of “man made global warming” was wrong and the data was manipulated by “climate gate” the people pushing the political agenda for control switched to “climate change” to trick the masses. It was a general term before, I’ll give you that, but it since been used for those pushing the failed “man made theory”. CO2 is not a driving factor of climate. It is too small to do what those pushing the hoax claim.	UC7OpwzSrptjV3THlpMdcdtw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7OpwzSrptjV3THlpMdcdtw	1	UgzDR7LZd0gNIoCaYTp4AaABAg	RC Knight

Climate change is about all of the mechanisms that change the temperature of Earth's climate. 2. Man-made global warming is synonymous with "man influenced global warming." It's not saying only man is causing the globe to warm but it's significantly causing the rate of warming to increase. Data from private and public organizations in and outside of the USA agree with the science. 3. Global warming and climate change have been used in scientific papers for a long time and is still used in papers. The terms didn't change. They just mean different things. Climate change is all of the mechanism and global warming is one specific phenomenon.

Scientific truth is not determined by debate, especially when it&#39;s determined by people who are not literate enough to accurately judge the merit of the debate.<br /><br /><br />What is really at debate is the rate of global warming since global warming and period b/w ice age have happened in the past and will continue to happen.<br /><br /><br />However, the research has already being settled in scientific community, excepting few scientists who are basically prostituting themselves for bribes from fossil fuel industry.<br /><br /><br />What data from last 2 centuries show compared to similar data from last 2 millenia (1,000 years) or longer, is that the rate of global warming has dramatically accelerated due to man made activities.<br /><br /><br />Also, wide variety of animals do go extinct all the time, however, evolution doesn&#39;t work well when the rate of climate change is astronomically speeded up, as it has happened with man made acceleration of global warming.<br /><br /><br />FWIW, petroleum industry did non-public research during early 1970s regarding global warming. They basically found that it was scientifically sound and true, and that events like extreme weather, increased air turbulence, spreading of pestilence and disease would explode due to global warming.<br /><br /><br />When the industry executives studied the research, they embarked on a paid program to publicize the exact opposite, similar to what companies did with regards to Zantac (they knew it caused cancer), glyphosphate (causes cancer), smoking (industry scientists knew it caused cancer and wide range of chronic illness), opioid (industry executives knew it was addictive), etc.<br /><br /><br />FWIW, fossil fuel industry executives, along with auto industry executives, also conspired to successfully kill mass/public transit in United States as well as electric cars. I doubt Tesla would have succeeded without social/alternative media.	UCUOa4WXlnxIMb_Tg3HLtseg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUOa4WXlnxIMb_Tg3HLtseg	0

With all due respect, I suggest you find better sources of information. Models of the relationship between levels of greenhouse gases and average global temperatures have predicted global warming with impressive accuracy-even some models going back to the 1980s: https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-how-well-have-climate-models-projected-global-warming The point about running out of time to save the world is that the emissions we create today will have ripple effects for centuries. We truly are pushing Earth's ecosystems in the direction of mass extinctions, but these are ripple effects that unfold across decades and centuries. Take care.

The air inside a greenhouse is heated because it is trapped air....if you opened the top of a greenhouse, the heated air would escape and it would not perform as a greenhouse. It is sort of like your car parked in the sun with the windows rolled up....open the windows and the temp goes down. The atmosphere is never a greenhouse because in effect the windows are always rolled down....the use of greenhouse was wrong from the start but the word has stuck concerning global warming.

The atmosphere is a layer of GAS that surrounds the EARTH. A greenhouse has a layer of GLASS that surround the HOUSE. It’s all about insulation, if you have too little then the heat won’t hold inside the walls. If you have too much then the heat can’t get out.

It&#39;s the chaotic nature of this input in the system that is worrisome, and prevention is by far the best position. <br />With that said, there&#39;s a lot of extra carbon dioxide around, which isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing. <br />Carbon dioxide is an important fuel for flora. If we limit deforestation, it&#39;s possible that some decades from now we might experience some of the largest forests to ever exist, with all kinds of trees towering higher than today&#39;s giant sequoias. <br />Does this mean we should continue the rate of emissions? No, but until that&#39;s normalized, we should invest in massive forestation and bank on the current rate of carbon.

We are clearly exploiting the planet and ecosystems for natural resources — why arent we improving our ways of living on this planet? why do we keep exploiting and commodifying anything and everything — especially animals — when there is a better way. <br /><br />selfish interest is driving everyone to status quo and you want to make a video to keep the status quo<br /><br />you are clearly driven by money and capitalism so thats why you view the climate crisis as a new method of making more money — just like a good republican with all the projections	UCXO6byQA3z682WNAbA9hZAg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXO6byQA3z682WNAbA9hZAg	0

It's like they throw enough truth to get you to trust, then push you in the direction "they" want. Doesn't matter what the topic is. Just enough to keep doubt and confusion. As far as the climate change goes, when it gets brought up I always start with we can't have an honest conversation till all the variables are on the table. And without discussing the manipulation of weather, and the halt of that, there is no way to answer the question, other than, it is man's fault! But not the mass majority. It's a select few at fault here. In comparison to the population. It's all agenda 21 power and land grab manipulation.

Now let these numbers sink in, now take a deep breath and apply some critical thinking about the Nature of Reality. <br />These FACTS on C02 are never/rarely (as yet) expressed on mainstream media or from the likes of Extinction Rebellion, the reason is simple, these numbers would NOT convince the masses that the world is gonna be extinct in 7 years, and therefore they wont &#39;BUY&#39; into the hype. There are clear links as to the funding of XR and big business, do the research and<br />Dont believe the hype. OK lets clean the air make things more efficient as we always do (look how low diesel particulates pollution are now compared to the last 20 years)Follow the money as always.

I don&#39;t fully agree with the &#39;money-scheme&#39; curruption being a driving factor but think it is rather an externality of the climate situation. <br /><br />Ex:<br />Man and his wife live near an unclaimed forest. Man becomes a carpenter and builds a house for his wife. More people move to the area but don&#39;t know how to build. They hire the first man to build their homes. The forest is a free resource but the consequences of having less trees is an externality of the man&#39;s new business. <br /><br />In Sustainable economics we are taught to make a plan that brainstorms possible externalities and solutions to avoid having them. Of course we use real companies that already exist to see real life examples but if we applied this type of thought to a new company before it began service/production, then this company can reduce their ecological footprint while causing the least amount of consequences	UC-1Pun8U4WIve57r2sKVvpQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-1Pun8U4WIve57r2sKVvpQ	0

Over long periods of time (tens of thousands of years) this varies on Earth, largely driven by subtle changes in the Milankovitch cycles. But over the course of decades, these natural cycles are too small to have much of an effect and thus global climate remains fairly stable.<br />Since the 1970s the global temperature has been increasing:<br /><a href="https://www.nsstc.uah.edu/climate/">https://www.nsstc.uah.edu/climate/</a><br />The past decade was the warmest since 1880 with 2016 being the warmest and 2019 the second warmest (despite not being an El Nino year):<br /><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-noaa-analyses-reveal-2019-second-warmest-year-on-record">https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-noaa-analyses-reveal-2019-second-warmest-year-on-record</a><br />During the same period (1970s to present) Total Solar Irradiance (i.e. energy coming into the system) has been decreasing and for the past 11 years Solar Cycle 24 has been the weakest in a Century:<br /><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cycle_24">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cycle_24</a><br /><br />So here is my prediction.<br />With Solar activity stable (or slightly below average) global temperatures will continue to reach new highs as CO2 levels rise and the amount energy leaving the system continues to decrease and the Earth retains more of that heat.<br /><br />Not much of a prediction since we know from empirical data that this is exactly what is going to happen unless humanity gets its shit together and stops burning fossil fuels.

If one ignores the environmental costs then gas/oil electric is still slightly cheaper than solar by $60/kW My state is currently building two nuclear plants at an estimated cost of $26B (paid for by rate payers like me). And after that I will still have to pay for the electricity. For that same amount of money they could have put solar panels and battery back-up on 3/4 of the homes in my state and then I would not have to pay for electricity for 20 years. Sound cost effective to you? Na, me neither. For power generation capacity capital costs are often expressed as overnight cost per watt. Estimated costs are: gas/oil combined cycle power plant - $1000/kW (2019) onshore wind - $1600/kW (2019) offshore wind - $6500/kW (2019) solar PV (fixed) - $1060/kW (utility),$1800/kW (2019) solar PV (tracking)- $1130/kW (utility) $2000/kW (2019) battery storage power - $2000/kW (2019) conventional hydropower - $2680/kW (2019) geothermal - $2800/kW (2019) coal (with SO2 and NOx controls)- $3500–3800/kW advanced nuclear - $6000/kW (2019) fuel cells - $7200/kW (2019)	UCIt2NVhRNp5BCqsvy8KfN6A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIt2NVhRNp5BCqsvy8KfN6A	1	UgxxOQu_alWNP_FGkc14AaABAg	mafarmerga

The website also promotes claims alleging people living in close proximity to wind turbines suffer assorted detrimental health conditions. The creator and moderator of the website is unknown and unaccountable yet readily posts any unfounded, ill informed attack, distortion or blatant lie directed at pro-wind individuals or groups.[1] The STT About Page makes a number of unsubstantiated and demonstrably false claims such as:[2] We are appalled by how wind industry supporters dismiss victims, ridicule those who have different opinions and vilify those who are opposed to industrial wind power generation. We are appalled by the dishonesty of the wind industry, its supporters and those who operate within it. We are disappointed that the many who claim to have been made sick are segregated and dismissed. We believe the rampant installation of turbines across this country must be stopped or at least paused until a full examination of the facts is undertaken AND (most importantly) acted upon. STT complains about vilification and victimisation without providing any evidence yet the site moderator and many supporters consistently engage in vilification of opponents as illustrated by these various posts.[3] The site frequently employs descriptors such as "greentard", "fraud", "wind factories" etc. [4] The website does not pretend to be objective, it only posts comments and opinions that are opposed to wind energy while it actively blocks any comments that favour wind energy or contradict claims made on the blog. STT does not allow those it criticises to have a right of reply. STT accuses wind energy proponents of dishonesty yet it engages in exactly that practice by insisting landholders hosting turbines are forced to sign clauses despite evidence to the contrary from numerous industry sources. [5] The site also presents numerous claims that are factually incorrect. STT promoted its belief there is strong opposition to wind farm developments by publicising an event called the National Wind Power Fraud Rally which was held on June 18, 2013 in Canberra, Australia.[6] Rally flyer.pdf A large number of Conservative politicians and a well-known radio personality were supposed to speak at the rally but just prior to the event, many speakers pulled out for various reasons, leaving just a few speakers to contribute on the day. Only a few hundred people turned up for the event while a pro-wind rally held on the same day at a different location in Canberra had around five times larger. These and other claims ignore industry support for further independent research which has to date demonstrated no link between wind farms and ill-health but has pointed to a psychosomatic condition dubbed the nocebo effect [7], and, industry efforts to assist those few individuals who believe wind turbines have affected their health or are too noisy. To date STT has consistently denied the effectiveness of renewable energy, it promotes opinions from climate change denialists [8] such as Maurice Newman [9], it frequently mentions and criticises subsidies but fails to mention much larger subsidies provided to the fossil fuel and nuclear industries. STT promotes belief in a condition called wind turbine syndrome[10] even though the condition is unrecognised by any medical body anywhere in the world. Wind turbine syndromeis the invention of a doctor Nina Pierpont,[11] the condition is also promoted by Sarah Laurie a non-practising GP in Australia and the Waubra Foundation	UCIt2NVhRNp5BCqsvy8KfN6A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIt2NVhRNp5BCqsvy8KfN6A	1	UgxxOQu_alWNP_FGkc14AaABAg	mafarmerga

Electricity from solar is now cheaper than just about any other form of generation. Storage remains a problem, but not generation. As for wind power, it continues to grow as first generation windmills are replaced with next generation equipment: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power_in_the_United_States "not to mention each environmental impact."

I have an Aussie friend who is 100% off grid and uses satellite for internet, TV, and phone. "How do you suppose you have a net-zero carbon impact with wood heat?" Biofuels are carbon neutral. Either I turn the wood into CO2 or the fungi will do it for us. I would rather do it and heat my home without ADDING to the net CO2 in the atmosphere. My wood stove produces just as much CO2 as would the termites and fungi. I only burn abandoned or dead wood. I never take alive tree. "Ahhhh, you mean like in the production of your EV, and lubrication of moving parts?" No such thing as a free lunch it costs a lot to make any vehicle, but over their lifetime EVs have a MUCH smaller footprint than ICEs.

"People who relied on electric heat, were left without power in some areas." I have a friend who is in Newfoundland right now. Anyone with an off-grid energy system were just fine. It was only those who relied on the monopoly controlled electrical system who had problems. I too heat exclusively with wood (recent carbon energy, not ancient carbon energy so a net zero carbon impact). My home stays warm whether I have electricity or not. Save the petroleum for those things for which we have no good alternatives. E.g. plastics, petrochemicals, and jet fuel. Burning oil in ICEs or boilers is stupid and 19th century technology.

Look at why scientists are saying that it is man-made and how they know. Different types of carbon bond with different molecules. So the science can tell you where the carbon came from that you’re measuring. There are also answers for how this occurred in the past without human interaction. Scientist do know what caused those events. And you can read how they know. As for tracing the money, you can look at all of the different sources of funding around the world for this research and see that it’s very diversified. And yet the majority of those scientists come to the same conclusions.	UCNFOlKTbZx1hA9IeRWkXCcA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNFOlKTbZx1hA9IeRWkXCcA	0

I acknowledged that you may have an expertise in this area. Many response ago. You admittedly may have missed this, as you didn’t fully read my responses. However, I pointed out that you’re responses haven’t demonstrated any such expertise. Your degree means very little in light of your lack of understanding about what it means to have a scientific consensus. I’ve yet to share my education level or career choice, as those things have very little bearing on the truth of the matter. Throughout this entire discussion, I’ve only really asserted that the consensus is, climate change is a fact and humans activities are the major contributor. I’ve mentioned methodologies that have allowed them to come to these conclusions. And I have provided links for people to BEGIN research. You seem to be singularly focused on the credibility of you and I. If I am nothing else, I am articulate. Sure, I may be long winded, but that’s because I wish to be pedantic and attempt to avoid being misunderstood. Clearly I failed at that task.

When we look at the Scientific literature, before we understand scientific consensus, things can get muddy really quick. As mentioned, there are papers out there that disagree with AGW. Roughly 140 of them. Many co authored by some of the same people. This means that it could easily become some back and forth of “Oh yeah! Look at this paper!”, making it appear that there is some massive debate in the scientific community. It is also important to note that most of those papers denying AGW are pre 2004. As is discussed in my first link, many papers don’t address cause. As their focus is on a specific aspect/impact of climate change. The first and most important thing to grasp is that climate change is happening and must be addressed. If you personally decide that you don’t want to accept the human contribution, it doesn’t change the outcome. As I stated in one of the earliest responses, the debate now is what we do about it.

It has to be long to address the many errors in your assertions. You also seem to have difficulty with reading comprehension. We haven’t moved on to the scientific literature yet. We seem to be stuck on whether or not there is a debate and what a scientific consensus is. I’ve attempted to refer you back to previous points. What’s more, I don’t think, glancing back, I’ve ever claimed to be intelligent. I actually stated that I’m not the expert. I don’t put much stock in self proclaimed intellect. The reference to the aviation tech doesn’t denote belief in his claim of his title. I know you missed this, but it was to point out that the job title he claimed to have didn’t bolster his position any. Lastly, and never even touching on the main topic, I’ve had to use this many words again because you have an uncanny ability to get so much wrong in just a few words. It’s no wonder you think there is still a debate in the scientific community. You have trouble following this one.

Merely confused by your rhetoric. I was also very articulate with my points. I provided easily understood sources for any who wish to begin to research. It’s important to understand terms. As for repeating myself, we can’t move on until the current points are understood. As for labeling you, I did no such thing. I simply pointed out some familiar tactics you use. Anyone willing to honestly critique this dialogue will easily agree that I have attempted exhaustively to have an Intelligible debate. I didn’t use emojis to mock your responses. I’d ask anyone to point out where I conducted myself inappropriately. But again, I’m familiar with this tactic as well. You’re attempting to project your inadequacies onto your opponent. You even utilized the same phrasing I used to point out your parroting of commonly used denier rhetoric. You repeat “real research”. Something you haven’t indicated that you’ve done. For onlookers, when attempting to share citations from scientific journals, you can find some issues, as many are ‘pay to view’. You can however find those links in the citations of the shared material above. I haven’t put forth any position that isn’t linked and “verifiable”, as you say. Consensus isn’t science. However it IS how we typically point to what we claim to “know” within science. The consensus is formed when there is an over whelming preponderance of the evidence. Something isn’t consider science if it isn’t falsifiable. Therefore, a consensus can, and does change, if and when it’s falsified. There are, and should always be, scientists who challenge conclusions. This challenge is not indicative of a debate. It’s simply additional hypotheses being tested. As with most of my debates, I’m doing this for the benefit of the onlooker. Which is why I’m not emotionally attached to the argument. Pointing out fallacies is not an indication of an emotional response. Lastly, while I could be wrong, I assume your sign off with your job title was an attempt to show credibility. Perhaps you have studied this in depth, maybe you’re an expert in this field. However, nothing in the thread above indicates any such expertise. I judge the merit of an argument by its presentation. Yours I found underwhelming. I actually do see better from flat earthers. One of them was an aviation technician.

I gave a pretty coherent explanation of why we defer to scientific consensus in most arenas. It seems to be the case that you still don’t understand it’s importance. Yes, scientific theories adjust as new data is collected and placed into the formulas. However, it rarely ever overturns the theory, and instead strengthens it as it becomes more accurate. You also still seem to miss the difference between why we look at published work in a topic versus what “notable scientists” have to say. There have been 14,000 published papers concerning climate change, more than a few thousand would imply. Pedantic to be sure, But still note worthy. 97% of those papers have the same or similar conclusion, refer back to the meta-analysis I mentioned earlier. If those 130,000 notable scientists wish to be part of any debate, they need to submit their research for peer review. Otherwise they are white noise, mudding waters they haven’t really done any actual work in. I’m not sure how to quantify a “realistic position”. As for your citation of “only in urban areas”. This also is not a supported claim. It’s clear that you have a specific agenda here and are not looking for any factual data. I’d love this to all be a hoax. However, no one, including you here, has provided any reason to accept this hoax narrative. I debate flat earthers and creationists regularly. Their arguments are on par with yours. It’s all some conspiracy, there is still debate, it’s not settled, it’s all fake. I’m sure you’ll quip back with more unsupported assertions. I’ll link a few more places people can read about what a consensus is and means, with respect to this topic.

Your parroting of “consensus is not science” is very telling. In every field of science, consensus is a way for the fields to point to what is currently understood to be “fact”. I use fact in quotes because science does not attempt to deal in absolutes. Which is again why we attempt to understand what the consensus is. It’s the collective scientific position, which still takes into account some outliers. Science should never really be said to be “settled”. Although, It could be colloquially accurate to say this on topics like gravity, evolution, and climate change. I’ll again point out that I provided a link that supports my assertion that the majority of scientists not only agree, that climate change is happening, they agree that human activity is a major contributor. You keep stating that I haven’t done the research. Im not quoting FOX news or infowars here. I’m citing NASA, Climate.gov, and the like. Pew research shows how media, not science, has caused a debate among laymen. Actual published climate scientists do not acknowledge this debate narrative. Another point of fact is that the 97% consensus may actually be off, as the 3% of papers, that claim to contradictory the mainstream conclusions, have themselves been found full of contradictory and flawed approaches. It may be the case that they are all together discarded, making the consensus even closer to 100%. Again, these are published papers that are part of the consideration. Not the weather channel founder claiming some conspiracy nonsense. So, I will say this again, you can disagree all you want with me, However anyone who does even the most cursory of research will find what the scientific consensus is. Moreover, what it means to have a scientific consensus.	UCNFOlKTbZx1hA9IeRWkXCcA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNFOlKTbZx1hA9IeRWkXCcA	1	UgwPay3yhjYrQpwOI_54AaABAg	Shane Duncan

This takes all of the research, regardless of conclusion, and compiles the results into an overarching conclusion. The meta-analysis of all the papers written on climate change show the consensus of human affected climate change. The analysis can also show to what degree most reviewed papers attribute to human activities. So to argue that there is this massive debate about IF human activities contribute to climate change is demonstrably false. I linked one source, there are others. The point, for anyone reading this thread, is that you can do your research and see that the data does in fact support what I’ve put forth.

It has been used to determine the amount of carbon emitted by fossil fuels vs. terrestrial plants and oceanic exchange. This is how they know warming events in prehistoric times were caused from massive forest fires during one period and volcanic activity during another. Again, there is enough data to support the human contribution to the current global event. You can argue with me all you like. I’m not the expert. I read the data. I see the peer reviewed papers that overwhelmingly support the conclusion. This false narrative that there is still some debate about climate change and it’s main cause in the scientific community is unsupported. The debates now are how long will it really take, how bad will the affects be, and what can be done. Those are the uncertainties.

This means if th amount of CO2 doubles and temp goes up 1 degree it takes another doubling to increase it by 1 more degree and so on. so the more CO2 the less effect it has - this is well known but not mentioned. compound interest increases its effect over time, whereas CO2 decreases its effect with increase - so this is an incorrect analogy.

We don’t know enough about Earth’s climate as a interconnected system to be unleashing vast amount of GHGs with certainty that it won’t end human life on Earth in the coming centuries I agree it probably won’t be as bad as alarmists suggest but just looking at the basic science behind climate change it’s clear shit is most certainly gonna go down so I’d rather be over prepared and be as ambitious as possible with reaching zero emissions than not. Not to mention the negative consequences of other related contemporary issues (plastic pollution, water contamination) which will certainly compound with climate change to seriously fuck humanity up socially and economically.

Of course not, this is hyperbole by radical climate change activist to scare people into action. Is climate change a serious problem? Yes. Do we need to take steps to address it? Of course, but some people are already working on that. Should the governments of the world give more incentives to develop the technologies we will need to get through this? Yes. Do they have to make massive changes in our economies to do that? No.<br />The rise of CO2 in our atmosphere was from 280 parts per million (PPM) to 412 PPM. That caused about a 1 degree Celsius temperature rise. Acording to some reports that I&#39;ve seen, it will take a rise to 800PPM to raise it another degree. <br /><br />There are a number of feedback loops out there that can also effect the Earth&#39;s average temperature. If the tundra starts to melt (which it has( it will release methane, which is a more powerful greenhouse gas than CO2. The more ice melts, the more heat that will be absorbed by the planet, instead of being reflect away. There are more, but you get the idea.<br />To summarize my position on this: Climate change is real and the change is mostly caused by human activity. We need to do more, but we don&#39;t have to ruin our lifestyle to do it. We have time.	UChzfa-pbKzCjyvnayg9lHEw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UChzfa-pbKzCjyvnayg9lHEw	0

I still don’t see any evidence that this is caused by humans (although there is a mechanism proposed at least, but Vostok ice cores complicate even that). I mean, even Mars has been going through global warming, which makes me think solar cycles. That said, I think it’s wise to do the things that do not harm people—plant trees. Lots of them. Continue to innovate on cleaner emission. I still am concerned about air pollution. I heard the modern internal combustion engine has gotten very low emission. Glad to see that. I think focusing on the correct problem (air pollution) is crucial. Also heard Vostok ice cores may be pointing to the edge of another ice edge. Wouldn’t that be ironic (a much bigger problem).

I&#39;m however unwilling to accept WE the humans are the main cause or only cause. BUT we CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT, though we have very little will to do so. IF fossil fuels are the main cause (as in burning them release CO2) then the solution is simple, burn less and plant more trees. Let&#39;s face it, the main reason for burning these fossil fuels is to generate power for Industrialisation, to produce, to compete, to survive. What&#39;s the point of not burning fuel to produce energy when half the people end up dying of cold and starvation (because they didn&#39;t produce enough of anything to ensure population survival). That brings on the 2nd quandary, which is morally incorrect to bring up, WHY is the global population growing so rapidly? Assuming that we (humans) are causing Climate Change, then WE ARE THE CAUSE. WE burn those fuels, we release those CO2. NO AMOUNT OF RENEWABLE ENERGY can overcome our rate of population growth. Next, why are we not producing more Nuclear Energy? It&#39;s virtually Carbon Free to produce.	UChkSCh_rrT_5a07ki3ycMzg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UChkSCh_rrT_5a07ki3ycMzg	0

There is supposedly ancient city near Japan that is now under the sea, estimated to be made above ground thousand of years ago. The Real Estate values in coastal cities like Miami, or Tampa really have not been effected. They seem to be still building on the coast as well. I think allot of the deforestation and road building is helping to cause this. Walk on hot asphalt-no way, now multiply that by a couple of million miles around the world and you have a mini oven.<br /> I think it is this simple, the climate change is real. We have no way to even comprehend the cause. There have been people that proved the earth is flat I am sure. For all we know it might have been a solar flare from 100 years ago.<br /><br /><br />One solution for the politicians that say we only have 12 years to live--- Take away their retirement and post retirement health care plans!!!!!

Everytime an volcano erupts, it releases huge tonsss of co2 into the air. CO2 is a green house gas, it increases the temperature of earth. This increase in temperature would then SLOWLY melt the glaciers and icebergs. Glaciers icebergs are able to reflect whatever heat away from earth. So when they melt, heat will not be reflected away from earth. Hence, temperature increases. This cycle repeats itself and that ended the ice age.

That Electric Car still needs raw minerals to be ripped from the ground and a coal fired foundry to be forged. The electric car batteries are toxic in land fill. Its all a virtue signaling dog and pony show. There is nothing that can be done to seriously curb carbon emissions. We are reliant upon Fossil Fuels to keep civilization moving forward, but to what end? Maybe Nuclear is the only real solution?

I knew a few quiet voices explaining to me the flaws in the thinking of this programme even back then. But no global debate ever took place. There was no intellectual debate. The phrase just appeared possibly around the time of Al Gore chipping in.<br />You think wealthy industrialists don&#39;t love their own grandchildren? Or banking people who love money are happy to lend out large sums that will never be paid back to retire on a dust bowl?<br />This movement since around the late 80&#39;s has anti-mankind at their core. Anti-industry, anti-mind... anti-life (man&#39;s).<br />Solution: Promote what you want, whilst ending all government subsidies and regulations. Sound money only; i.e. private.

However, it seems that you&#39;ve tried to smartly sidestep an important topic and introduce uncertainty and bias to avoid taking a stand. <br />Your conclusion especially around the need for scientists to present more proof is escapist, as there&#39;s enough data accessible - just look at the IPCC report from last year, if you will. <br />As for your second point around % attribution of climate change to humans vs nature, this is a question that&#39;s deliberative and can never be conclusive and thus open to further polarisation on deniers vs believers. <br /><br />Please don&#39;t misguide watchers by taking a strawman stance and shifting ownership from having an opinion / perspective - you can say you don&#39;t know or you can own up and take a strong stand - we will not stop watching you.

We can't hold people who are not scientists to the standard of scientists and expect them to read scientific literature without the tools to understand what conclusions can be drawn from it. But since it's an important topic that's become political and everyone is confused about, now it's the job of scientists to make it as clear as possible for people to understand. And i think Pat's idea is brilliant because having both of the top scientists for and against in the room will make it easier to judge, as long as they come prepared.

How many people you know are not self aware or don&#39;t really care about these things at all? These people tell you it&#39;s not real, or they don&#39;t care, won&#39;t change, will continue to live their lives, etc. This is why humanity sucks. People just don&#39;t care and will fight to defend the system. People don&#39;t wanna change their ways. Tradition is a killer. Literally.

I question this because i have seen some reports that shows volcanic activity as an even average when it seems its more variable than that. The other factor i would like to know, which you seemed to have missed out , is the sun ; if the sun is on a cycle and we are entering a warm period and this heats the oceans does this also release c02 and thus accelerating the process, if so how much c02 is being released this way, and is it being measured and if so how ?

IF the at least 2 windows are not open at all time, after 30 minutes my head starts to spin around and i start losing concentration due to the amount of 2CO in the room. The same experience i get when i take a full bus or Metro.<br /><br />I also live in the small capital Sofia (2-3 millions), however our air is very bad due to the large amount of cars and coal burning.<br /><br />Now, you can imagine the amount of emissions (2co and methane) that a farm with hundreds to thousands of pigs or cows produces (and from what i know, live stock is responsible for at least 16 % of global emissions).<br /><br />I don&#39;t know why people have such a hard time comprehending the amount of emissions we release and how the Earth is a bigger version of my work place (office room).<br /><br />My biggest argument against climate change deniers, is that if they are right - that&#39;s fine, we will continue to increase our emissions and see what happens.<br /><br />If they are wrong however, it will continue to get warmer and warmer. Our air and minds will be poisoned and more ineffective to deal with this issue.<br /><br />My point is that the scientists, activists and politicians have a point - it is WORTH to invest in research and renewals now, UNTIL we exactly KNOW what we are dealing with and how to deal with warming in the long term (and what % of warming is caused by humans).<br /><br />From what i see however, humans tend to take action when the sh*t hits the fan.

After the deep solar minimum passes, the sunspot activity will rise and the planet will start to cool. Thd cooling will be maximum at the grand solar high. In the 1970s and the early 1980s the big talk was the impending ice age. I actually had a teacher cry in front of the class while she read out of a Scientific American about how bad we would have it by 2010 because of everything would be frozen. We were supposed to be under 2.5 miles of ice by 2010. The doom saying of the impending ice age was in all the media. Classes were interrupted, television programmes were interrupted to preach about the ice age. Newspapers, radio, televion, it was everywhere. It can still be found today. Of course the World Wide Web did not exist back then. You will have to make an effort and go to a library and look up microfiche and microfilm archives to find it. I specifically remember Time Magazine, Scientific American, Omni Magazine, and Popular Science, all had articles on the impeding ice age. There was a television programme hosted by Leonard Nimoy called, &quot;In Search Of,&quot; that had a few episodes about the impeding ice age also. This is why I have such a hard time believing this is all human sourced trouble. It is amazing how the impending ice age is barely mentioned anymore. But I remember. The crying teacher scared me in a manner that I could never forget.	UCBgSSUpq1QjpDGPPn-1Gm1A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBgSSUpq1QjpDGPPn-1Gm1A	0

We heard about the great judgement day and every man should repent and be save while many think there is no God. Now why risk going to hell if you are not so sure? It is easy to be save live according to the bible and not risk it. The same thing here we can find other ways to live and follow the scientists who are trying to save the planet. No one is certain about this for sure so the best way is to prevent and not try to cure after the fact. We have nothing to lose protecting the earth but a lot to lose if we risk not listening.

The chronology of it proves man has existed for close to 6,000 years, and this entire physical dimension was created within 6 24-hour days. <br />There are many refutations of the systems used for dating, including the discarding of dates not fitting the established proclamations. For examples, type: <a href="http://beforeus.com/">beforeus.com</a> .<br />And<br />YouTube, Thunderbolts Project. <br /> And if the earth were so old, it&#39;s indeed difficult to believe scientists can decipher so much of events and conditions 300 million years ago.

They also found evidence that Vikings grew crops on Greenland. It is too cold in Greenland today for either crops or trees to grow. There is an obvious conclusion there. <br />&quot;Climate scientists&quot; change data, and hide the minoan, Roman, and medieval warming periods. If you need to change data to make your math work, it&#39;s not science, and people who engage in this are not scientists. <br />The warming that has occurred since 1979 has not equaled the cooling between 1945 and 1979. <br />Since the mini ice age ended in 1850, one can explain sea level rise, and temperature rise as the natural cycle of climate.<br />To say humans have any significant influence on world temperature is very arrogant, ice core data shows temperature rose and fell at least 7 times in geologic history, humans only have emitted significant amounts of CO2 in one of those occurrences. If you have 7 experiments, all have the same conclusion, but 1 had a variable, do you blame the variable for the 7th conclusion? No. If you have 7 experiments that all have the same conclusion, and 1 has a variable, the variable has no effect on the conclusion. <br />So based on that alone we can surmise that the inconsequential heating that is going on is, 1) not dangerous, or a &quot;crisis&quot; and 2) it it a natural cycle, and 3) humans have no significant influence on global temperatures. <br />Why anyone believes that a trace gas, (450 parts per million) can affect temperatures significantly is a mystery to me, especially when all known life on the planet is carbon based, i.e. has to have carbon to exist, and plants breathe CO2. <br />There is much more empirical evidence that climate change is a myth, but I will encourage everyone to research it themselves. <br />&quot;Climate scientists&quot; also have a zero percent success rate on their doomsday predictions, so one can evaluate credibility from that.

If we doubled the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere overnight we could swim in the Arctic Ocean no problem. By the way, we are currently at just over 400 parts per million of Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. So the swing is from 200 parts per million to 800 parts per million. <br /><br />Regarding the scientists. A scientist proposes a hypothesis, then other scientist who are in the same field will do all the same experiments and more and put all their effort into proving the hypothesis wrong. If the ten best I the field can not prove it wrong and keep proving it correct, then speaking with certainty and authority on the hypothesis becomes very easy and it is now a Theory. Remember this about theories. Gravity is a theory, but if you jump off the roof of your house one million times, you will fall to the ground every time. But, gravity is still considered a theory. It is just a very well established one. Man made climate change, has moved from hypothesis to very strong theory, just like gravity. The last time the earth warmed it took 10,000 years to move one degree. We did it in how short a period of time? And we were not around last time.

Assuming climate change is a problem what specific problem are we trying to prevent. <br />2 what specific viable plan do you have to combat climate change.<br />I just want to mention that the green new deal and the Paris climate accords are far from what you would call a viable plan. I also want to mention that much of the climate change debate has been about virtue signaling which I abhor.

The big problems with renewable energy is foremost we are reaching the limit of battery capacity and plastic parts are often made from plastic which is made from oil.

Tim Ball even got sued for defamation in regards of the lies he spreads. In one of the cases the judge dismissed the sued with the reasoning that Ball's claims are so redicouless that no thinking person could take Tim Ball serious and therefore his false claims cannot be defamatory.

If a theory falls apart another one is created based on the failures of the previous. Politicians and the layman need to stay out of it. A proper theory will eventually prevail and that&#39;s the one we must accept. We can&#39;t use what we think to determine what is right, science doesn&#39;t work that way. Scientists are more excited when they&#39;re wrong than when they&#39;re right because they&#39;ve just learned something new so let the process work itself out and we just bear witness.

The first published document using the terms global warming and climate change was in 1953. None of this is new. To say that scientists do not consider &#39;natural cycles&#39; in their assessment of the climate is narcissistic and naive. What happen over one million years ago is irrelevant and a distraction from the facts. The 12 year warning is not that we have 12 years to live, its that we have 12 years before our effect on the climate is irreversible by humans. There is no need to look at both arguments, one is a set of scientific data the other is non-scientific nonsense designed to create doubt.

Yes, we contribute to climate change to some degree. That degree varies wildly according to where one lives, industry, consciousness. And yes the earth goes through warming and cooling cycles. Has always done so. All that is fine and lets continue to clean up the environment and be conservative minded (not politically but fiscally and environmentally). Clean air, clean water, clean soil. Those are awesome goals. We also have to do something about humanities inherent greed that so often results in harm to water, air, soil, and itself (and nature too).

More companies, governments and NGO are profitting with the change. If you know how much billions goes around in this business, you would have known that every politicians want a piece of that pie (the EU is getting funds for 1.000 billion euro, and the public must pay for that).<br />We are funding wind energy with our wind mills, mills that arent giving us the energy that justify the money that is put in to it.

This is having an impact on agriculture and food production as we speak. The floods in Midwest caused less crop cultivation in the Midwest by 30% last year. Thousands of farmers have committed suicide in India( one of the largest argicultural country in the world) becuase they cannot grow enough food to sustain themselves as the crop yields have decimated in rent years due to change in the pattern and amount of rain they get In the monsoon rain season. Zimbabwe is on the brink of societal collapse due to mega droughts. By the way what straw man has to do with climate change.

Thats why they dont sell their jets and yachts, this plan is not for them, its for you.<br /><br />People are the first spiecies smart enough to uncover and free the CO2 that was caught up in the ground 350 to 300 billion years ago. This world is gonna be a green oasis ones all that CO2 is back in circulation. Ask any farmer. Greenhouse effect = abundance. The only ones that dont want us to thrive are the elites.<br /><br />They want us to live in filthy cities (like Detroit and Baltimore) while farming their land and sending the best food, clothes cars an entertainment to their castles. And we can live off their scraps<br /><br />Kind of like the hunger games....	UC9wc-Wzb06eq6Fll_FW4GRw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9wc-Wzb06eq6Fll_FW4GRw	0

UgwQhmSUmedJQzVKov14AaABAg	2	1	2020-01-14 08:38:44	Salciano	Patrick, I commend you on your efforts to try to understand and expose this problem, but, after reading the comments, I am certain that you should leave the talking about this problem to the people who actually understand it.<br /><br />This is because you have made certain untruthful statements that do not help this problem, at all. This is because of the way you presented this problem. Because of the focus on non-scientific assertions, like what politicians say or what some people believe, instead of what scientists already know. Because of highly inaccurate and unfounded citations, like &quot;12 years to live&quot;. Because of the way minor uncertainties were amplified, as if that would discredit known facts and make the climate problem impossible to understand or to solve.<br /><br />I assume this wasn&#39;t your purpose, quite the opposite. To better understand our problems. To better solve them. However, if you take a look at the comments, you&#39;ll realize this video was interpreted quite differently.<br /><br />If you read them, they seem to think that there is still a &quot;heated&quot; and highly &quot;controversial&quot; scientific debate with &quot;major&quot; unknowns, when on truth controversy is insignificant. Any uncertainties, like error margins, which are minor (yet many) details, promptly discard, discredit and transform scientists into an incoherent rambling mass.<br /><br />Concerning man-made climate change, there isn&#39;t really a debate in scientific literature, at all. So, it&#39;s wrong to present this as a debate or a &quot;belief&quot;. Climate change is not about beliefs. It is real.<br /><br />Did you know that, in 2013, the scientific consensus on this issue was about 98%? Did you know, that it has been estimated that last year, in 2019, of over 10000 peer-reviewed papers, 0% disagree about antropomorphic climate change?<br />doi:10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024024<br />doi:10.1177/0270467619886266<br /><br />Presenting this problem as a debate. Saying that we don&#39;t know much. Saying that there is no consensus. Saying that a few scientists seem arrogant for being too assured. Saying these things isn&#39;t reasonable or realistic, at this point.<br /><br />This debate you are looking for does not really belong to scientists of this century anymore, just as a debate about whether the Earth is flat or not. So, doing this is not helping. It&#39;s going backwards and we really don&#39;t have the time to go backwards. I don&#39;t mean to sound alarmist, but it&#39;s just we don&#39;t have time and we need to implement tremendous changes not to fall behind. The very attempt to go backwards will, at this point, mostly strengthen supporters of misinformation.<br /><br />At this point, we should move forward and be having another kind of debate. A social-political one, mostly. Not a scientific one. At least not on the subjects you presented.<br /><br />As for presenting facts erroneously. Scientists know how snowball Earth melted. There are indeed natural cycles and changes. These are facts just as real as human made climate change. They are not really &quot;arguments&quot; against the existence of human made climate change.<br /><br />Also, scientists do have data well over 100 years, concerning this issue. As an example, geologists have taken samples from the Earth to figure out this figures, tree rings, etc. This is backed by decades of computer models, cross-comparisons of data, experiments, peer-reviews, especialized panel reviews, etc.<br /><br />Of course the more recent data is accurate, but that does not discount previous data. In fact, as our knowledge grows, it reinforces what we already knew, in general. Not the other way around.<br /><br />We don&#39;t really need to know exactly all the percentages about everything. The planet is a very complex system. Estimates from measurements taken in one place, like the sea level, are going to differ from measurements taken on another place. The Earth is not a perfectly shaped object. Water levels will rise differently according to each place&#39;s geography, local dynamics, the Earth&#39;s very own relationship with other astronomical objects, etc.<br /><br />To have a perfect oversimplified number estimate, we would have to punch in all the data from everywhere on Earth and outside Earth or something along those lines. There would still be (and there is) a lot of noise in the data. It&#39;s also unfair to ask to oversimplify something as complex like this. It becomes itself a source of inaccuracy, because it won&#39;t apply uniformly across the Earth. So, it&#39;s an unnecessary, expensive and time-consuming effort to do. <br /><br />So, if you examine the problem you just posed, you will realize that it is expensive, time-consuming and completely unnecessary and unreasonable. It&#39;s presumably easier to just fix the problem or to invest this effort on more productive things.<br /><br />For some reason, it looks like some people prefer to &quot;side&quot; with things we don&#39;t know, rather than the ones we already do.<br /><br />So, if we have data pointing to climate warming, even if the data is not perfect, what sense does it make to support the opposite side that is not supported by data?<br /><br />Just because we don&#39;t know exactly how many ants are out there, doesn&#39;t meant that we don&#39;t know that ants exist. It also doesn&#39;t mean that we don&#39;t know anything about ants. It doesn&#39;t mean that the ants don&#39;t exist.<br /><br />We know we are responsible for these substances, we know their effects are harmful to us and the environment. We can experimentally reproduce these things. We can and we have observed and measured the evolution of the effects of human activities on our ecosystems. We know very much what is going on with a great degree of certainty.<br /><br />It is wrong, and quite sad, to present or amplify the minimal uncertainties we have, as if it discounts everything we know, as if we know next to nothing or add if these minor details are greater than the major problem itself. It isn&#39;t.<br /><br />We know we have a problem? Yes.<br />Do we know what the problem is? Yes.<br />Do we know how to mitigate it with our current technology? Yes.<br /><br />If you consider our objective knowledge, you&#39;ll realize that these questions aren&#39;t really up for debate. We already have established these answers very well. We can learn more, sure, but we already know most of the stuff mentioned.<br /><br />What&#39;s really up for debate are questions of different nature.<br /><br />Do we try to pay for the costs of fixing these problems now or do we pay for them later?<br /><br />Waiting can allow for better technologies to develop to help at lesser costs. It can also help establish a greater need for urgency and more favorable social and political climate, as problems start accumulating and populations become informed, but at the cost of our health, the long term economy, nature and future generations. Also, widespread education about this problem is not guaranted. It&#39;s also important to note that, according to the ICCP, some damage is already irreversible, at this point...<br /><br />How can we get everyone to help on this issue? This is humanity&#39;s problem and, at our current technological level, we need everyone to help, not just one country, etc...<br /><br />Even on YouTube, try typing in &quot;climate change solutions&quot;. The list goes on and on... For the facts focus on scientists. For debates, opportunities and such, focus on videos made by politicians, entrepreneurs, etc.	UCdW3MVsYWFNNdOJBEUhzw-A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdW3MVsYWFNNdOJBEUhzw-A	0

They treat the existence of climate change as a sociopolitical problem that we have to vote on like healthcare or free education and hopefully the correct answer is somewhere in the middle. Except that climate change is not like that at all. The existence of climate change is not determined by a bunch of dilettantes debating about it. It's determined by research carried out by experts who have devoted their entire lives to studying the climate and the collective results they have got are crystal clear: AGW is real, it's happening and it's pretty bad. That's it, there's no much else to debate except how are we going to deal with it. You want to debate with the scientists? well, get your Masters, get your PhD in Climatology , devote your entire life in studying the climate and publish a ground-breaking legendary research paper that actually debunks and cancels all the previous climate research books and papers in the last 50 years and completely revolutionizes the field of climatology forever. That's how you debate a scientist. So long as you can't do that, you better believe the scientist when they tell you climate change is pretty real.

It is slow now, but after few years, non-linear change might happen. Another point that I want to make is that climate change and air pollution are correlated. right? Most of the perturbation that leads to air pollution end up in climate change. Therefore, taking precautions to control climate change is crucial.

But there are dominant elements in our government that have an agenda and they are using scare tactics in order to push it and gain control over the populace so that they can put in place policies and regulations that will erode our civil liberties and gain ultimate control, power and money. We ALL want a clean environment. It&#39;s just a matter of how we do it!	UCejczWw-Yb1cwzHDARU7Afg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCejczWw-Yb1cwzHDARU7Afg	0

Go and research the other 149 chemicals that come out of your exhaust pipe. Maybe research the environmental consequences of Fertilizer production and usage. Maybe research the toxic pesticides sprayed on your food and released in bulk into the atmosphere. Research the effects of upper atmosphere nuclear testing on the environment and human health. Carbon Dioxide is the least of your problems and. I find it amazing that people worry about all these exotic ways to die but climb in their car with no concept that is in fact going to be the most likely way you prematurely die, kill your children or end up permanantly injured.

UgwZeCfvRXCIATKSTCZ4AaABAg	0	2	2020-01-10 22:11:05	Paul Stivers	I think it&#39;s telling to look at how the Global Warming concern is being used by liberal politicians. Here&#39;s one example. The &quot;Climate Change Justice Tax&quot; in Portland, Oregon. <a href="https://www.wweek.com/news/city/2020/01/08/no-american-city-has-ever-tried-a-climate-justice-tax-like-the-one-portland-is-launching-whats-the-plan/">https://www.wweek.com/news/city/2020/01/08/no-american-city-has-ever-tried-a-climate-justice-tax-like-the-one-portland-is-launching-whats-the-plan/</a><br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />1. Tax local retailers to the tune of $60 million a year. This means reduce companies&#39; profits and competitiveness, raise prices to consumers, reduce the value of companies&#39; stocks, reduce the value of people&#39;s investment portfolios and retirement plans, and so on.<br /><br />2. Give the money exclusively to minority owned businesses and &quot;underserved communities&quot; to make a minor dent in energy consumption via things like improved calking and weather stripping in homes. (Never mind that people can easily make these improvements themselves if they want to.)<br /><br />These efforts have been tried around the US for at least 10 years, including in Portland. The idea originally was to fund green energy companies that would eventually become profitable. However they never did become profitable. That is, if people are left to make their own decisions in a free market, they won&#39;t spend their own money this way because they don&#39;t perceive the benefits to outweigh the costs. They&#39;re only willing to spend what they perceive as other people&#39;s money, by voting for the tax.  So in the end it&#39;s rob from retailers and all the people who are either customers or partners with retailers, and put the money into yet another sink hole of special entitlement.<br /><br />So, is global climate change human correctable, or is it a trumped up liberal tool for more government control and special entitlements? Follow the money.	UCdjb9ji1Gk3DAiAqe65jzWg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdjb9ji1Gk3DAiAqe65jzWg	0

In my opinion humans are causing climate change to accelerate but to what exact percentage idk for sure. We need oil for plastics and we don&#39;t have a good replacement right now.

I want to challenge you to do you most research ever and investigate the age of the earth. During this investigation you will find undeniable evidence that proves the earth could not possible be that old.

There are alot of mistakes, theories, hypothisis, opinions in science that have not been proven yet are accepted as fact. What is widely regarded as fact has in many cases in fact been incorrect. It was widely believed that the earth was flat and was the centre or the universe... now we have proven that to be incorrect. You clearly believe in Climate Change. They say we got 12 years to entirely stop using fossil fuels of we going to all die. I can promise you in 12 years the world will not have have reduced CO2 by even 25%. We havnt even created alternative fuels for PLANES, BUSES, TRUCKS, SHIPS, ROCKETS which pump out much more CO2 that cars in total. France (who is so green energy in public) get about 95% of their electricity form Nuclear Power Stations (which is not green) have not even done much in changing that.

This exchange into and out of the atmosphere is called &quot;carbon flux&quot;.<br />Every year around 220 billion tonnes of CO2 is released into the atmosphere by natural sources like: <br />o Ocean degasification; <br />o Rotting vegetation; <br />o Soil degradation; <br />o Volcanic eruptions; (etc.)<br />Humans are now digging up and burning stored sources, adding around 9 billion tonnes per year. This is known, and in the scientific literature.<br />&quot;Ah hah hah!&quot; I hear you say. &quot;Sean! You&#39;ve just said that <b>natural emissions</b> are 220 billion tonnes and <b>human emissions</b> are 9 billion tonnes!&quot; <br />&quot;Wait for it,&quot; I say.<br />This sum does not take into account the natural uptake of CO2. <br />That&#39;s an important point so I&#39;ll say it again:<br />This sum does not take into account the natural uptake of CO2.<br />o CO2 is degased from the oceans, but even more is dissolved back. <br />o Rotting vegetation releases carbon, but growing vegetation takes it back. <br />o Carbon is being released by soils, but carbon is also absorbed by soils. <br />o Volcanic venting is balanced by chemical weathering.<br />It&#39;s not an exact equation, but it has been in balance for some time. <br />And CO2 levels have been stable in the atmosphere for at least the last two thousand years. <br />Buuuuuut! (And you should be able to guess what I&#39;m about to say next.)<br />We are adding 9 billion tonnes of CO2 to the atmosphere that isn&#39;t being removed. As such, the carbon flux equation is out of balance, and CO2 levels are climbing. (Data available from ESRL: <a href="https://esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/">https://esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/</a> )<br />This is why comparing &quot;human vs natural&quot; CO2 is pointless.<br />It does not take into account the carbon cycle. (Carbon flux, by another name.)<br />And yet people still peddle this myth.	UCunKL_7sc5c9JySLrdG-HqA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCunKL_7sc5c9JySLrdG-HqA	0

If you can predict exactly when a volcanic eruption will happen then you can predict that, as well as how many cows will be born tomorrow, how many flora and fauna will grow as well as many other things. There are TONS of factors people have completely disregarded when comes to climate change that baffles me, I mean the whole premise of anthropogenic climate change is the Amplification Effect which was disproven but is believed to be real because we've politicized the issue to hell and back because some fringe group of scienctists figured they could get free government funding if they can claim it's a serious issue that they're trying to solve. Also a lot of the pioneers of the whole global warming idea are now ousted as frauds in the climate sciences community. Also saying it's natural therefore it's good (therefore it has no effect on the enviornment) is a naturalist argument, that is a fallacy.

It's more probable that more carbon equals more heat which means more clouds which would result in a net LOSS in global average temperatures, which of course is why in the last 50 years the average is only 1 degree, of course you hear some things like "California has had average temperatures go up" they are in a drought, and they are in an area which does not support a lot of rain, so of course. If anything the Ozone layer being eaten up during the 70s probably accounts for that 1 degree of change.

Add to that, super high tides with ocean surges, of course it&#39;s flooding and not the first time either.<br /> The temperature rise is not 1 degree per 50 years, it&#39;s 0.8 degrees C in 200 years, natural climate change that we have from exiting the last ice age.<br /> Of course capitalists are protecting their oil money.<br /> EVERY single thing you own required oil for it&#39;s manufacture and before crude oil, we killed whales, seals, mutton birds etc, so crude oil actually saved the environment.<br /> There are no scientists on the IPCC, they take selective evidence from selective scientists whom they pay.<br /><br /> There really IS climate change, it happens all the time and we DO need to deal with it but we can&#39;t change the climate, even if tomorrow everyone in the world stopped emitting CO2, it would change back to what alarmist say it should be.<br /> We have increased CO2 to some of the highest levels ever, but the temperature is flat as are sea levels, generally.<br />Around the equator the levels are high in some places, like Tuvalu, and Tuvalu have lost some islands. But they have actually made a net gain in land in the 4 decades, so today there is more of Tuvalu than there was 40 years ago.<br /><br /> Our biggest disaster is deforestation and polluting oceans with plastic. <br />Trees attract rain and if you cut them down, there is drought.<br />Plastic in the oceans kill sea animals from plankton to whales and birds.<br />The food chain is being destroyed by plastic.<br />Plastic comes from petroleum, that&#39;s the only link.<br /><br />CO2 is 0.03% of our atmosphere and we contribute 0.7% to that atmospheric CO2 which means we contribute 0.0002% to the overall volume of our atmosphere.

Human beings have been walking upright and using indoor toilets for less than 100 years and yet we seem to think that we understand this Emerald and lapis lazuli spaceship with supreme hubris as long as there is $1 to be made on a trillion barrels of oil there are going to be those who will rebuke climate change because industry is based on fossil fuel production why not ask Ellen musk why he&#39;s spending billions to leave this planet as opposed to billions to save it he knows when we reach 10 billion population but the strong will begin to literally eat the week there&#39;s another book called 10 billion written by an author I can&#39;t recall he&#39;s a bright Guy and quotes the great Naom Chomsky throughout the book and the last paragraph he says teach your daughter how to use a Glock 9mm come on you&#39;re smarter than this	UCSYFQc9iF6zJ9ZqCR5ANjtw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSYFQc9iF6zJ9ZqCR5ANjtw	0

The other day I saw a question asking what do you think is the greatest threat to humanity today? I thought about it and honestly the very first thing that came to mind was FREEDOM OF SPEECH!!!<br />Yes I know when you first read or hear that it is almost blasphemy but think about it the fact that people can pretty much say what they want make any narrative suit what ever they want and on topics like this is were I say that you should not be allowed to lie even if it&#39;s not on purpose because people can not be trusted and use history to cast judgment. The part were I said even if it&#39;s not on purpose I only mean that in the way were when people who are trying to scam others then are shown undeniable facts they say oh I made a mistake it wasn&#39;t on purpose even after you show that they had already knew the facts	UCXuM9_YNXLy_QMENT_rTtrw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXuM9_YNXLy_QMENT_rTtrw	0

Furthermore, with much of the worlds population relying upon melt water from glaciers and snow for their water supply, how will the human race survive? How many millions of people in India rely upon the Ganges river? That river is partly supplied by monsoon rains but also supplied by glaciers that have traditionally grown by snowfall fed by those same monsoons. Yet the retreat of the glaciers documented over the last twenty years show that this will end soon. Thus the land below has too much water in the flood season and too much drought in the dry seasons. Where will they go and how hard will they fight with their lives on the line. LACK OF WATER IS FATAL. We must preserve water unpolluted everywhere at any cost. Nothing is more important to our survival as a species. Mother Earth will always survive, but will she be in a condition for us as a people to survive??? Today&#39;s profits won&#39;t buy you much when the world starts throwing nuclear bombs at each other over drinking water and the whole globe is uninhabitable. Maybe the human race is a virus infecting Mother Earth and we are poisoning ourselves with our waste products. She will recover in some form but will we? I have found not one reputable &quot;scientist&quot; who disputes that the human race has had an impact upon the climate. I also have not found one to dispute the natural cycles. The real question is just this - how much of this is human impact and how can we minimize it? And it is not just CO2 but also Methane which is twenty five times more powerful as CO2 as a greenhouse gas. We came together and stopped the destruction of the ozone layer by CFC&#39;s and HCFC&#39;s in the past, but can we do this again with greenhouse gasses? More importantly can we do it in time?

It focuses on the upper atmosphere while geospace and lower atmosphere forcing exists as well.<br /><br />2) While irradiance varies by very little (0.1%) and decreases during solar flares and plasma explosions, the particles and magnetic fields can increase 1000 – 100,000%.<br /><br />3) Maximum global warming of 1° C (2016) occurred as THE record El Nino occurred, releasing energy stored from the largest grand solar maximum of 11,000 years. Volcanic cooling was at a record low.<br /><br />4) When this interglacial period ends, a 10° – 30° C drop in temperature will occur.<br /><br />5) The cooling/freshening of the oceans by polar ice melt is a major, forgotten concern. Perhaps it was the absurdity of the 4-day catastrophe in the movie “The Day After Tomorrow” or the appeal of global warming, but THAT ice age trigger science is real and has been forgotten.<br /><br />Below You Will Find The Most Important Updates<br /><br />PARTICLE FORCING:<br /><br />Electron Storm Flux Varies 10x Over the Sunspot Cycle.

What’s at risk is humanity and civilization because we won’t be able to adapt quick enough, especially when we’re pretty much literally and figuratively dumping gasoline on the fire; making the rate of climate change occur at a much quicker rate than what is natural is the result of a heating atmosphere due to the burning of fossil fuels. It’s important for humanity to get on a sustainable track, not for the Earth’s sake, but for humanity’s long-term stake. In tandem with nature’s natural cycle.

Of course not, it is virtually impossible to prove anything 100%, all science can do is try to establish if the theory aligns with the observed state.<br />The vast majority of climate scientists say that the alignment does in fact come close to the theory.<br />This judgement may change in the future, however given the strength of the consensus at this juncture I would say the chances of that happening are probably akin to the chances that smoking does not cause cancer.

I even remember going through this in the seventies. Currently on one side of my family there is a pretty big degree of panic about the whole situation and I was recently trying to not get into the conversation with them because it was thanksgiving :) and I am not as up to date on the science. So what I was really poking at was the panic, concern is good, panic causes bad decisions and perhaps bad interpretation of existing data. I would love to be much more informed on the science ( I enjoy Science) but I am not as informed on climate science but I do know there is some interesting points of disagreement. I will study it more. Having said that I am all for figuring out ways to deal with pollution and climate change but talk about the cost $ of not looking into it from both sides objectively. One example is how are they dealing with the toxic downside of dealing with disposal of batteries? Again I am not fully up to date. Thanks again for commenting.

Do those people think there is no money in green energy? In other words, are the billions given in subsidies to green energy companies not sufficient to continue to push climate change? Not to mention that companies like Exxon and Royal Dutch Shell are investing heavily in renewable energy. So in all seriousness, renewable energy is being pushed by the same companies that climate alarmist are saying are the evil empires. Pull your head out of your a**, its about the money.

Alot of times people will read a paper or a written piece and if they agree with it, they fall into the consensus. Just because a paper is drafted or a report doesnt make it 100% correct. Most scientists will put information that backs their claims and omit anything that would muddy the waters. Thats how they get paid. Consensus can be reached by money, bribes, blackmail, political pressure, etc. Just like alarmists accuse the oil industry of doing. Climate change alarmists say the oil industry is putting out false propaganda and the truth is whatever they agree with. Isnt it just as likely that there is reason for skepticism and maybe alarmist should stop casting dissenting opinions away just because it makes them work harder to prove their hypothesis. It is healthy for science to question.	UCtGdKMeaRyHPOl_Vh1yMKsw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtGdKMeaRyHPOl_Vh1yMKsw	1	Ugz3uCLj777Z8VJJzIp4AaABAg	Nominus Fobiscum

He had several snippets of videos where we dont see the full context and then he would "debunk". I can find thousands of debunking videos, that doesnt make them correct or accurate. They are easy to make and easy for the viewer to follow along. Its low hanging fruit. Science is not based on consensus and conjecture, its based on having a hypothesis and being able to prove the hypothesis over and over. Thats why the whole climate change agenda bothers me. They are backing into science and claiming its a consensus. The agenda pushers will state there is a 97 percent consensus. Yes, when you ask the question "is the climate changing and do humans contribute". Not hard to get a consensus there. Especially when a large portion of that 97 percent dont even study climate at all. A scientists can show a warming trend and show increased CO2 and most people will go along. When you get into the weeds the consensus starts to break up. "How much are humans contributing" "would it make a difference if we stopped using carbon based items all together" ? Some say 5% others say 50% and others say 90 percent. Your source said 33%. The one constant that I notice is whatever source has skin in the game, such as IPCC or Leonardo DiCaprio.org tend to have higher measurements. I wonder why that is? If the IPCC said only 4% of global warming is human caused, the govt would cut off funding.. turn the problem into a life threatning one and the money faucet is full blast. If there is a consensus you would see across the board data and very little variance. Dont get me wrong, I think climate change happens and I think humans are a contributor; however I dont think throwing money at the problem is going to help much. The earth had cooling and warming periods despite no money being thrown. I think its arrogant to believe a species thats been on earth .0025% of its existence can some how adjust the whole eco system. Especially when 75% of that planet is covered by water and we dont have much say in those parts. Anyway, fun talk. Im going to go now and enjoy the planet. While I Can.

I can find a hundred other opinion pages that say just the opposite. They have sources and references too. The point isnt "is the climate changing", the point is how much do humans contribute, which is in great debate, and are you willing to completely upend our standard of living to maybe move the needle fractions in either direction. Changing out our entire energy grid would cost trillions. You want people to stop driving, flying, heating homes, basically living, for something that has a huge swath of differing opinions? Not to mention that even after we made all those huge life changes, the climate change that you all fear, might happen anyway. Sure, research alternative energy sources, recycle, walk or carpool, we can all do our part and it isnt difficult or expensive. Today's climate change movement asks government bureaucrats to make changes which will inevitably lead to gov't power increasing. Green energy lobbies the same way oil companies do and if you think the govt has your best interest at heart then you are setting yourself up for disappointment. This is what govts have done since the dawn of man. Pick something that will strike fear into the hearts of everyone, pretend like govt has the solution and then demand power and money to fix the problem. Nazis used it to garner fear of outsiders and anything not German. Mao and Stalin used it to stoke fear of the rich (see The Great Leap Forward). Religions use it stoke fear of anything outside the religious purview (this has gone on for millenia). Fear perpetuates fear. Thats why when someone disagrees with climate change, that person is said to be a kin to a Holocaust denier, or a shill for the oil companies. See AOC whom stated "climate change is our world war 2". Its become the religious community all over again. Anything outside of our opinion must be destroyed. It is my belief that there are many things that should take precident over the climate change agenda. But hey, you guys go and decrease your carbon footprint, Im sure the earth will thank you.

They also paid about $20 billion in restitution, if thats "nothing", please review the definition of "nothing". You also need to re-examine your definition of "evil empire." Usually the empire doesnt revolve around isolated accidents that surfaced with zero intention. Were they deliberately spilling oil, in order to kill thousand of animals and ruin wildlife? Have wind turbines not killed hundreds of thousands of animals? I guess they'd be considered "evil empires" too, right? Fossil fuels have saved millions of lives and advanced civilizations for well over 150 years. Climate change is an exaggerated problem to garner control and stoke fear. So thanks for being a perfect example of a person consumed by that fear. Quite of few predictions have already failed to come to fruition. Why do you think most climate change legislation we've seen revolve around wealth redistribution and governmental control of private industry? Its a grab for power and money. If climate change was the dire problem that the alarmist say, why dont they stop contributing to the problem? Most climate change advocates have a bigger carbon footprint than 20 people put together. Al Gore flies more and uses more energy in his million dollar homes than most small businesses will in a century. And hes just one example. I guess its "do as I say, not as I do". The hypocrisy is deep. Sorry. I dont buy the hysteria.	UCtGdKMeaRyHPOl_Vh1yMKsw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtGdKMeaRyHPOl_Vh1yMKsw	1	Ugz3uCLj777Z8VJJzIp4AaABAg	Nominus Fobiscum

We know this because there are different isotopes of Carbon, and so we can use this to show that all of the increase (from ~300 ppm to ~400 ppm) is 100% due to human emissions. You can think of it this way... without humans, the atmospheric CO2 concentration would still be around 300 ppm. Since CO2 is the causal instigator of all of the feedback mechanisms, we can then say that humans are causing 100% of current observed climate change.

No it doesn't. http://www.woodfortrees.org/plot/hadcrut4gl/from:1979/plot/gistemp/from:1979/plot/uah6/plot/rss "The ocean warming is certain compared to what, exactly?" It's certain because we can measure it, both directly and through the effects of thermal expansion. "Volcanic activity plays a major role as well." Major eruptions have short term effects of surface temperature, that's the only major role of volcanism on the timescales under discussion. "And the ice melting? Well, a pole shift suggests a different story," I doubt you've any idea what you mean by that, the decline in land and sea ice has been accurately measured in recent decades. https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/sotc/ice_sheets.html "Well, that's the basis GHGs work on. They absorb, and re-emit solar radiance... however, like i said, CO2 doesn't have that property." That looks like you're claiming that CO2 isn't a GHG, I'll assume that's not your meaning (because it's a really ignorant claim to make) and suggest you reword what you're trying to say. ". . the earth has been in a warming trend for centuries." No it hasn't, the warming trend is less than 2 centuries old. " "There are no observed mechanisms that can explain". If that were true, then like i keep saying, we wouldn't be entertaining the developement of new instruments and measurement systems used in helioseismilogy to further our understanding of the full spectrum of solar influence/forcing." We're continuously improving our understanding of the universe through better technology and new methods, we've been doing it for centuries and will continue to do AGW or no AGW. "TSI measurements still leave questions that need answers." TSI varies by less than 0.1% between solar maximum and solar minimum. Again I suspect you're out of your depth on the science. "The warming observed is inline with a trend that's been observed for centuries." Simply untrue, warming over the last century is unprecedented since at least the establishment of this interglacial period (there may have been similar rates of warming during the glacial to interglacial transition - about 12,000 years ago).

The only rational conclusion is that the Earth is absorbing more energy from the Sun than it is releasing back to space, causing it to warm up. There are no observed mechanisms that can explain that observed radiative imbalance other than the enhanced GH Effect, and the warming observed is in line with that calculated by scientists as far back as a century ago.

Lots of people are "the type" to think that, for you to not think that you must be avoiding even the standard skeptic sites like Spencer's, Curry's and Watts that at least understand that CO2 is a GHG, even if they believe climate sensitivity is at the low end of the possible range. ". . . to think the most prevelant GHG (CO2), causes warming, which it does not." You contradict yourself inside a single sentence. If CO2 is a GHG it has the effect of making Earth's surface warmer than it would otherwise be, so saying it's a GHG that doesn't cause warming is nonsensical.

"Insulation". No analogy is perfect but the fact that an increase in GHG concentrations slows the rate at which energy in Earth's atmosphere escapes to space thus increasing the temperature in the lower atmosphere - in the same way that increasing a houses thermal insulation will slow energy escape from the house (to a colder outside) is sound.

And I'm not suggesting CH4 is irrelevant or anything, of course it's important, but don't disagree with any of that, hence me asking why you are bringing it up? What are you even arguing here? Are you arguing that CO2 does basically nothing of consequence? I'll just add that one of the major anticipated feedback systems is methane positive feedback, where methane from the situations you described is released due to a small amount of initial warming due to CO2.

This is how it's modelled though, when doing simple energy balancing. I don't understand your logic of why a spontaneous emission lifetime of 1/3 of a second means CO2 cannot act as a GHG. The very fact that it CAN absorb IR radiation alone is justification of it being a GHG. A longer lifetime would make it a worse GHG, since you need to wait longer until it can absorb IR again, and a shorter lifetime would make it a better GHG since it is absorbing and re-emitting more often. This is all accounted for when conducting energy balancing though. As for methane, what exactly is your point? Yes it's a more potent GHG than CO2, but it doesn't last very long in the atmosphere. What's your point?	UCiLiD_nWxpOatR3ZpDnD_lA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiLiD_nWxpOatR3ZpDnD_lA	1	Ugwy9Soa6r7bMtI21w94AaABAg	Richard Feynman

This is a quantum mechanical question now, and quantum mechanics predicts random emission directions.

And a spontaneous emission half-life on the order of a second is pretty normal, a bit on the high end actually. Substances used in lasers tend to be on the nano-second scale.

You talked about possible Exon Oil interference put you failed to mention the overwhelming political interference, From Al Gore/Obama. From - Local Government /Central Government and World Government/IPCC all affecting funding to Universities /the science/education system. The IPCC ( politicians mainly) set up in 1988 to search in favour of man-made global influences only and hence publishes selected science that agrees with that. The reason why we saw Michael Mann&#39;s hockey stick graph published and not the more experience Briffa&#39;s graph that didn&#39;t concur with the hockey stick. <br /><br />To add also the influence from mainstream media, actors like Leonardo Dicaprio/Arnold Schwarzenegger etc. We haven&#39;t seen propaganda on this scale before.

So scientists have a financial incentive to claim it&#39;s really happening.<br /><br />You forgot to mention all the previous hoaxes, like global cooling or the hole in the ozone layer. Every 10 or 20 years they come up with some new world ending scenario.<br /><br />They have been caught exaggerating or just blatantly lying about the data multiple times.<br /><br />Deforestation isnt really happening, we have more trees now because forests are more organized and optimized to produce the most trees per area. Also trees aren&#39;t even that great of a plant for reducing co2.<br /><br />When they say scientists have a consensus on climate change, they always forget to mention what type of scientists they asked. If you only ask climatologists you will get a very different answer, but they allow anyone who claims to be a scientist in any discipline to have a vote on if its real or not just to inflate the numbers.

Logic used to be a requirement with the first universities that Muslims created, and I believe it was also continued in the Christian universities that followed. They both studied Greek philosophy in depth and understood that all discussion had to be based on a rational basis. If there's no one to understand logical communication and there is no demand for us to communicate in the language of logic, then anyone can say anything and you wouldn't know the weaknesses in their arguments and you wouldn't know how to question that person to arrive at the truth. Then everything becomes about emotion like we see today - emotion + superficial logic	UCgGG-jOYn1G1EeqPvmHoFjQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgGG-jOYn1G1EeqPvmHoFjQ	1	UgwW-pjPnXTd7YTt7sN4AaABAg	Jim Pifarre

I personally worry about the government becoming tyrannical in a climate change crusade. There is only ONE way to tackle this problem and that is higher energy prices. I suppose the somewhat decent way I could see the government doing it is by eliminating all taxes like the income tax, and then taxing energy to raise the cost artificially to spur investment into alternative energy without leaving the bottom half of the population in a worse position.

But alarmists claim that our climate is controlled by the amount of CO2 in our atmosphere alone and nothing else. And that can very easily be disproven. CO2 is one of the many driving factors, that is sure. But to what extent it contributes to global warming will have to be investigated further. Unfortunately the whole thing has become very politicised over the last few decades. But I&#39;m pretty sure we will not all have died in 12 years time.

I personally think it is good to be skeptical and it is a good thing you are searching for the truth yourself. I wish more people would do that instead of believing the information we receive through MSM because they are often wrong. If a journalist does not know what he/she is talking about they should not write the article in the first place. Unfortunately this happens a lot. I like people like John Christy and also Judith Curry who are not afraid to speak out. We should have a more open debate about this subject and see on what points we can agree. Einstein simply used Newton's equations to further expand on how gravity works and now we have discovered the Higgs particle which seem to move in a gravity field so yes, we keep discovering new things. Science is never settled, as the alarmists want us to believe: we will always discover more.

I will not put a link here because the comment will be removed but look for the YT video called "Climate 101" narrated by Bill Nye. Watch the whole video. If you really know something about the subject you will know that co2 warms our atmosphere though radiative forcing and not through convection or thermal conduction as portrayed in this video. Our sun is not an IR lamp, Many scientist have warned for this kind of misleading experiments, still Al Gore and his Climate Group are currently travelling the world and they are still using this kind of misleading videos and information. Instead of taking the video down they disable the likes and removed the comments. So don't blame J P for believing incorrect information but blame those alarmist who started the whole thing. I personally know Richard Tol, he is also Dutch and currently professor at the University of Sussex UK. He was getting very annoyed with the misleading information and in particular the fact that it had become a political movement. He had always worked with the IPCC but about 5 years ago decided he did not want his name mentioned anymore in the latest IPCC report, he does not want to be associated with them anymore. If I have to chose between politics and science I will chose science. And if you have the truth on your side there should be no reason to lie. The damage the alarmists have done can never be undone, it is too late for that. BTW: Thatcher had a very different agenda, she wanted to push nuclear through and that is why she supported it. And it is one of the reasons why the IPCC was founded in the first place.

Because I live in the Netherlands where there have been earthquakes because of drilling for natural gas I had it disconnected in 2013 and now use a heat pump. In this country gas (petrol) power cars are not allowed to be sold or imported from January 2030 onward. Despite claims of the IPCC and people like Al Gore CO2 is not the sole climate driver. The IPCC even admits this in the latest assessment report (2015) where they further lowered their estimated human activity (AWG) to 50% or more. That sounds a lot more realistic than their previous reports. Unfortunately alarmists like them and Gore spread a lot of misinformation and they do knowingly and that creates a lot of disbelieve.

Those who've actually conducted that experimental design and posted results and method used have not been able to present the consistency required for CO2 and a 'greenhouse' hypothesis to actually alter temperature trend. Just because you think you understand Valrath823 doesn't make you validly 'correct'. There remains no validated experimental physical link of CO2 to temperature. A photon is not 'heat'. Try the experimental design of Al Gore yourself.	UC0vuPFyieT1vAXScjtcwOTg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0vuPFyieT1vAXScjtcwOTg	1	Ugzd2qXUT_BqlvbBCmh4AaABAg	Peter K. Anderson

That whilst no direct, physical experimental result has shown CO2 capable of altering temperature trend. That step has been avoided as it is a failure whilst effort of inference is all you'd highlight ...i.e. 'co2 is rising, temperature is rising, there must be a link' is inference.

If you look at something like flat earth for example or evolution almost all denial comes from the right religious side and close to non comes from the rest. Anti GMO science denial seems to come mostly from the left (and maybe from libertarian conspiracy theorists) This is with many issues that science denial is one sided. Anti vaccine seems to be one which is spread evenly, but that isn't true for most. In regard of climate change almost all science denial comes from one side, while on the other side you find misrepresentations (which isn't good but not the same as science denial). "Scientists are paid to come up with a certain claim...not how science is supposed to work" Yes and that isn't true. Are you seriously claiming that 99.994% of all scientific papers in the last years on that matter were part of a grand conspiracy? Scientists doing normal research are getting paid shit in comparison to what they could make in the private sector. "Weather events" Again the media misrepresenting the science doesn't change that the science is clear. The issue is that Capitalism makes it impossible for the media to honestly report on climate change as the topic isn't sexy. When a scientist finds "if we don't change anything the north pole will be ice free by 2013 to 2050", then the media has to pick the head line selling the best and cuts out the "if we don't change anything" and the "to 2050" part. Now right wingers use that newspaper headline and claim "the science is wrong, it is 2019 and there is still ice on the north pole". The only science denial comes at the end there. The profit driven cherry picking of the head line is despicable, but it doesn't mean that the science is wrong.

This debate would prove nothing scientifically - only thorough research into the true nature of the atmosphere and the effect of solar emissions and other exterior factors such as cosmic rays will do that. At the same time because the world's mainstream media has taken the AGW credo on board to such an extent there is much misinformation out there, as I'm sure you will agree. In fact AGW is a populist notion by and large. Moderate voices need to be heard, as well as opposing views. When alarmists start screaming that skeptics and deniers should be shut down it makes me even more convinced that the alarmists are wrong.

It is a lack of progress that got us into this mess and so many of the greens policies are about reduction and going backwards (ie carbon taxes), rather then any real innovations forward. Energy should be cheaper and more efficient to produce now then it was in the past. We should have stopped burning fossil fuels decades ago, instead many great innovations, ideas and alternative energies have been suppressed (This is what really needs to be explored). Governments & oil companies are addicted to the $ that fuels bring in, main reason we still use it. Bureaucracy, regulations and more taxes won't solve nothing. How much money do they need to start??

The human centered and therefore corruptible ground temp data shows warming. I trust the far more advanced and clean data from above. Luckily the sea level data is yet to be corrupted and shows no increase in the 1mm per year rise in sea levels and 1mm happened before the industrial revolution and has not changed. Do the calc to see the horrible flooding that will not occur.

Focusing on just heat waves in not only disingenuous, but also incorrect. Many more people have died in the past from heat waves...and it stands to reason, when access to water and air-conditioning were much harder to come by.

Among the distortions, half-truths and lies:<br /> Deniers claim it&#39;s cooling... <br />AND that it&#39;s not changing at all... <br />AND that it is warming from the sun, or from volcanoes... <br />AND that it actually is getting warmer from GHGs but it&#39;s everyone else&#39;s fault but the US<br />AND that it’s happening but it’s good for us. <br /> They claim nothing should be done... <br />AND that nothing can be done... <br />AND that we could have done something but it&#39;s too late now. <br /> They claim the interglacial warming is still occurring even though it ended 6,000 years ago. <br /> They falsely claim CO2 is not an effective GHG... <br />AND that it is an effective GHG but there isn&#39;t enough to matter… <br />AND that there is enough to matter but more is always better no matter how excessive. <br />They parrot every possible, unsupported claim by literally anyone, regardless of expertise, just to confuse the issue... <br />AND deniers completely contradict each other. There is no coherent scientific view in opposition. <br /> No denier has ever produced an accurate climate model because their premises are false. The only people who buy into the lies are the radical-right which is heavily financed by the fossil fuel industry. <br /> Everyone used to care about the environment but it has not just been abandoned by Republicans for corporate interests, they are actively engaged in its destruction.

I was interested because I've observed that deniers (and yes I know you don't consider yourself a denier) 20 years ago had harder stances in general, like "humans activity has zero effect on the climate". Many of the US conservative talking heads like Glenn Beck and Tucker Carlson now have soft denier positions, e.g. "why should we do anything when no one can tell me what's going to happen exactly?" For them , all paths lead to the same place: "we don't need to do anything". OK I'm done.

These are: (1) You might be an older fella, because you called me "my boy" in your previous message. This suggests that you've known about the idea of global warming for a while (remember how we used to call it "global warming"?). Genuine question: what was your position on climate change 20 years ago? (2) You mentioned your work in foresty. It reminded me that my aunt worked in foresty for the Canadian government. She's one of 9 siblings my mother has, and they're an unusually science-nerdy family. None are climate change deniers, except her. Just a curious observation.

Well, in my books, based on what you've written above, you're a denier. But if you support policies that would reduce GHG emissions, then I support that. Maybe to you I seem like a small-minded, panic-stricken, alarmist nincompoop, but I arrive at my conclusions (which I wish were false) through what I believe to be an honest evaluation of the evidence that I've seen so far.

I would ask that you consider my arguments, not the tone in which I made them. That's what's important. If you can't do that, then I can't help pointing out that you're not coming from a position of strength anyway, because you've used plenty of ad hominems in this exchange, like mockery. Even writing "typical liberal" is an ad hominem that you wrote... to complain about my use of ad hominems. OK, well, you don't have to believe me when I say I have scientific background. I'm not about to dig up and upload my BSc. It doesn't make me right anyway. I don't know where you get the "pathological liar" from. People who know me report that I'm way more honest than other people they know. That's part of accepting uncomfortable truths. You're genuinely the first person to ever call me a liar, let alone a "pathological" one. I've already explained my criteria for denialism. One of the most frustrating things about this exchange is how you seem to forget what either of us have previously written, like when you insisted I misquoted you (twice!) when I had copied and pasted your own words. I think the motive question is worth thinking about, but it doesn't make a person right or wrong about an issue. That's all I put it out there for: food for thought. It kind of seems like I struck a nerve with that one. Maybe there's something to it? We're seeing the effects of global warming already. Honestly, there's no point digging up examples and presenting them to you. You'll just retort with "no you're so wrong because [reasons]". That's the effect of motivated reasoning. You want so badly to believe something that you seek out and find only information that confirms those beliefs. It's all too human. Again, I'm no mind reader, but it's something you might want to think about. Since when did I deny that resource extraction has no value to humanity? It has enormous value. But it has costs, and climate change is a huge one. I also never claimed not to be a contributor to climate change. I use indoor heating, and air conditioning, and drive a gas-powered car, and eat meat, and fly airplanes. But none of that is relevant as to whether or not the orthodox view on climate change is correct (and yes, I'm a proponent of the orthodox view, and you aren't). Let's put an end to this, shall we?

But I still include them under the umbrella of denialism. I'm not sure which one is worse: the full denier or the soft one. The latter can lend an air of sophistication to their disinformation, but at least they accept some reality. The general theme with soft deniers is that they minimize and divert from the issue. They say things like "oh sure humans have a role to play, but we don't know how much", or "it's not that bad", or "if we take serious action to address it, we'll cause greater catastrophe", or "there are bigger problems in the world to worry about". I don't have the ability to interpret science perfectly. No one does, even in their own field of study, if they're not examining something that relates directly to their specialization. But I do have the ability to think critically and know bullshit when I see it. I also do have formal scientific training, even if it wasn't my ultimate career (science is boring, what can I say...). I still think the comparison between you and the anti-vaxxer stay-at-home mom is apt. Who cares if you're American? Whatever, I guess I forgot to consider folks from Northern BC and the prairies (especially Alberta), where climate change denial has a pretty strong foothold. But being a denier has no nationality. Fine. I do think there's one last thing worth thinking about, and that's the motive of the person who accepts the science versus the one who denies it. In truth, I really, really want the consensus of climate science to be wrong. I truly do. Pondering the kinds of catastrophes that will face humanity in the future because of climate change, some of which we're already seeing, is really scary and depressing. I don't want to believe what you would call the "alarmist" view of global warming is true, I just accept it because I value knowing the truth over comforting lies. That's also why I don't believe in God and an afterlife. It would be nice, but it's total nonsense that can't stand up to scrutiny. On the other hand, what's the motive of the denier? Seems to me they get to feel much more comfortable about the world. There's no impending catastrophe. And their own contribution to the problem is no big deal. Feels good, man.

I thought, "no need to hurl insults like that, even if this guy is being pretty obtuse". Let's rephrase then: maybe you're not dumb, but you're... weird? How can I describe someone who says "you misquoted me" when I literally copied and pasted your own words? I dunno. And even weirder, now you've doubled-down on that. You know YouTube has kept a full record of this thread, right? You can look for yourself. Either way I apologize for the name calling. I also hadn't noticed, when I wrote my last reply, that you had written two replies, and actually sent me sources. Hooray! But I must admit to being disappointed with them. The random commentor in that Google group appears to be skeptical of global climate models because he thinks all the climate scientists have taken the wrong "conceptual" approach. Yeah, sure. And John Christy is a known denier, of which there are a handful with credentials, like Richard Lindzen. There's lots of people with degrees out there. It's not surprising that a handful emerge and make denier statements, then are held aloft by the denier crowd because it helps lend a veneer of respectability to their fundamentally anti-science views. I know you discredit skepticalscience, and probably also desmog, but I have to hand it to the folks who run those websites. They've done the painstaking work so that people like myself don't have to (and frankly, I can't cause ain't nobody got time for that). I have no idea how successful you are. What a strange comment. I guess you've written this in response to me saying that I don't believe for a second that you have formal scientific training. Since you don't deny it, I'll consider that confirmation that I'm correct. I maintain that the anti-vaccination stay-at-home mom analogy is a good one. The internet is a place where people can find support for whatever view they want to find support for. Folks like you make me sad for humanity. If I can't count on my fellow humans to understand reality, how can I count on them to do the right thing? I guess I shouldn't be too surprised, since after all a huge chunk of the American population are fundamentalist Christians who believe the universe is literally thousands of years old (and it seems very likely that you're American, because there's far fewer deniers outside the USA). And then there's the anti-vaxxers, the "no GMO" crowd, fundamentalist Islam, flat-earthers, and the list goes on and on...

UgxTx-NZeWMRTPHTLCx4AaABAg.91t-yaKiMBY920-Dv9l-8w		0	2019-12-01 17:53:54	Georges Prat	@J P I frankly just can't believe that you would have any advanced education, because if you did there's no way you would have made various statements you've made. Then again, there's plenty of people with letters after their names that are idiots, it's just that it's rarer than with people without the letters. The principle of "who has the burden" is pretty simple. When there's an established, settled view in any field of study, the burden lies on the person trying to assert that that established view is wrong. I think I understand now why you disagree you have any burden, because it seems you think (quite erroneously) that the science is on your side. So it's left to me to do the tedious task of looking back at our comment thread for any factual statement you've made, and to respond. I've admitted many times I'm not fully equipped to do this, because I'm not a climate scientist. But I'll try. I'll be putting your thoughts in quotes, but they might be paraphrased, not direct quotes: (1) "The science that human-produced CO2 is the cause of global warming isn't overwhelming."; Yes it is. That's why there's a consensus among climate scientists. There's other effects though, like CH4, deforestation, etc. It's more accurate to say humans are the cause of the rapid warming seen in the last two centuries. (2) "Solar activity is the main driver of global warming/climate change, not CO2."; It depends on what you mean by this exactly. The main climate change claim is that the *increase* in global warming over the last two centuries is caused by human activity. That doesn't mean that, over the entire history of the planet, the sun wasn't the primary driver of climate change. However, deniers have brought up this point numerous times, essentially arguing that "it's not us, it's solar flares!" or something similar for the recent increase (on a geologic timescale) in temperature. That's been debunked ad nauseam. (3) "Carbon only holds heat for about a 3rd of a second."; I don't know if this is true or not, and without looking it up, it looks irrelevant anyway. Carbon could dissipate heat quickly and still be a primary driver of global warming. After all, if carbon doesn't hold heat for a long time, where is it going? If that heat isn't immediately leaving the atmosphere, then it's still warming the planet. (4) "The only consensus there is, is that humans have a role in climate change through emission of non-natural GHGs"; That is part of the consensus, but there's more consensus than that, including that humans are the primary driver of global warming over the last two centuries. There's several consensus studies published out there that you can read about (i.e. papers reviewing all the science and concluding that the consensus exists). Do your homework. (5) "You have an alarmist side, a realist side, and of course deniers. In between each, there is no agreement, and scientists are all over that spectrum."; No they're not. Climate scientists, the people most worth paying attention to (because it's their field of study), agree that there's unprecedented warming over the last two centuries because of human activity. They might disagree on the particular policy prescriptions, but I doubt any of them say "well it's no big deal, really." (6) "Humans contributing greater than 50% of warming aspects... is nowhere near being true."; Humans are the primary driver of the *increase* in global average temperature in the last two centuries. (7) "There is absolutely no data that suggests humans are the main drivers of climate change. That's an unproven hypothesis, with many variables."; No, there's mountains of data. There's a consensus among climate scientists, because they've studied the issue and published, and reviewed, numerous scientific papers concluding that humans are the main drivers of climate change in the last two centuries. To say that "there is absolutely no data" is not only a bit wrong, it's extraordinarily wrong, and the kind of thing that makes me wonder if you should have a handicap sticker on your car. And no, there isn't a consensus among climate scientists because they're driven by a dogmatic need to conform. If you want to make this extraordinary claim, you need to provide evidence. (8) "[You say] human activity is the main driver, yet without the sun the condition of the planet would be, well.... dead."; Yes, the sun keeps the planet warm. Congratulations for understanding that. It's that the *increase* in global average temperate over the last two centuries is caused by human activity, including chiefly by the emission of greenhouse gasses. (9) "Care to explain a roughly 10 degree fluctuation in a 50-75 year period as evident from Greenland ice core data?"; I'd never heard of this before, so I looked it up and it's a tired and debunked denier talking point. Congratulations for your lack of originality and critical thinking. Please take the time to read how this widely circulated and misleading graph has been debunked. (10) "You [are] wrong about the current CO2 ppm (it's roughly 380)."; If you just google "current PPM of CO2", every search result indicates it's over 400, and I have little reason to doubt the accuracy of these sources. Apparently they're basing their data on the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii. (11) "You're completely missing the mark surrounding carbon's heat dissipation, and what are essentially "lifespans" of each gas/vapour."; As above, I doubt that this is relevant, even if true. This kind of reminds me of the creationist argument "evolution can't be true because it violates the second law of thermodynamics", like somehow all biologists just completely missed that their theory is made impossible by the laws of physics. (12) "The only actual consensus in climatology, is that of the fact us humans have a very small effect on climate compared to natural phenomenon."; It depends on whether we're talking about all warming, or the *increase* in warming over the last two centuries. The latter is the consensus of climatologists. (13) "What [climatologists] fail to tell you, is those effects are only seen in localized areas."; So do you trust climatologists, as you appear to above, or do you doubt them all, because "those effects are only seen in localized areas"? Either way, if you want to argue that their data is flawed, you need to do more than say "those effects are only seen in localized areas". First, is it even true? And second, why does it matter exactly (I'm not saying it doesn't, you just need more to establish your point)? (14) "Now, when did I say all the climate scientists are wrong?". Numerous times above. I suppose you didn't say they're *all* wrong, just that the vast majority of them are wrong. And your opinion is clearly contrary to the vast majority of them. I didn't provide sources above because you don't seem to think this is necessary. In any event, you'd probably say "well we can't trust those, they're alarmist" despite the fact they link back to primary sources (i.e. papers published in scientific journals), a point I made previously that you apparently failed to appreciate or address. I also think I understand a little better why you don't feel the need to provide sources yourself, which is that you're likely relying on sources with zero credibility and reliability, like e.g. Richard Lindzen, a known disinformation peddler.

Again, I'm not a climate scientist, but I know enough to suspect that you're presenting some irrelevant and debunked talking point about carbon's heat dissipation. But you haven't elaborated in any way on your positions, which is convenient because then you have nothing to answer for. You can just sit back and claim I'm an "alarmist" who "looks foolish". By contrast, I explained what I understood, because I wanted to know what you disagreed with. Your last paragraph is just tone policing. Whatever. I've made a bunch of arguments, and you haven't addressed them. If you disagree with the consensus of climate scientists, explain in detail why, and provide sources. At this point I can only conclude that you can't do that. That means you're worse than just ignorant, you're willfully ignorant. Or you're suffering from the Dunning-Kruger effect: you're too incompetent to recognize your own incompetence. It's scary how someone can know just enough to think they really understand something, and decide to reject a scientific consensus as a result. It's also incredibly arrogant.

Somehow I suspected you would still misinterpret my words, because you're eager for your "gotcha!" moment. Sigh... are you seriously denying that companies invest money in public relations to try and push narratives that could help protect their profits? Is it your position that this never happens, never mind whether it happens with the fossil fuel industry? Like, do you say the tobacco industry didn't try to sow doubt for decades about whether smoking tobacco was truly harmful, an easily provable fact? I'm not a climate scientist, so I'm unlikely to do the science justice when I explain it. But it's my understanding that the electromagnetic radiation, coming from the sun, bounces off the earth's surface, loses energy to be mostly in the infrared portion of the EM spectrum, and is absorbed by greenhouse gases. Greenhouse gases, like water, methane, and carbon dioxide, absorb the infrared radiation because they're bigger molecules than O2 and N2, of which our atmosphere is mostly made up. When these gasses do this, they cause global warming. Humans are adding CO2 to the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels. Scientists estimate that in 1800 there were about 280 parts per million of CO2. Today there's over 400 parts per million. This has had a powerful effect on the warming of the climate. Other human activity also contributes to warming, like deforestation. Obviously, climate models are quite complicated and have to account for various factors. That's my basic understanding of the science, so there you go. I'm guessing your response to reading about the mechanism behind human-caused global warming it to think "yeah but what about <insert debunked talking point here>?!". You say you're not driven by politics. Whatever, who cares? Either way, you're a denialist, and it's embarrassing, because it's ignorant or dumb. Since you seem to know a bit, I'm increasingly concerned that it's stupidity that drives you, rather than mere ignorance. The latter is easier to fix.

Do you similarly think that when doctors promote the benefits of vaccines, that they know nothing about how vaccines work or how they might be beneficial, they're just conforming? Please. You're flat-out wrong, and it's embarrassing. Humans are the main driver of the sudden rise in global average temperature in the last century. I'm just shocked at how you've arrived at the opposite view. This is why I'd love to see your sources. I'm not going to send you links to substantiate that fossil fuel companies spend money on climate-denial lobbying efforts. You can find the "money trail" easily. Besides, even if I did send you those links, you'd probably find a way to discredit them in your mind. It's also not central to the argument. Excuse-me, but I did provide sources for my claims. I know you don't like them, but you've provided none. So don't talk to me about "bringing forth scientific facts". I genuinely don't know how you could work in a scientific field that presumably requires basic scientific literacy, but be a climate change denialist. I'm guessing it's just a by-product of your political inclinations, which drives your motivated reasoning. Or maybe you're just well-compartmentalized in your thinking. It surprises me, because everything you've written so far suggests a Dunning-Kruger level of ignorance.

I'm not arguing that because the vast majority of a group of people agree that something is true, that that makes it true. I'm arguing that it's reasonable to consider something a fact when the vast majority of people who are experts at studying that particular thing agree that it's a fact. Because I'm referring to a group of scientists, I'm also safely assuming that they've reached their conclusions through an examination of the empirical evidence. That's because scientific claims, uniquely, must be falsifiable, scrutinized, tested, etc. Obviously, you're right that there is uncertainty in the data. There always is. Science proceeds through formulating theories, then refining and revising them. That's not a bug, that's a feature. But even with this uncertainty, there's no climate scientists that have honestly looked at the data and concluded that climate change isn't real, isn't caused my humans, and doesn't have major implications for present and future climate-caused catastrophes. That isn't alarmism or hyperbole, it's the implications of the data. I'm guessing you would put yourself in the "realist" camp. I'm actually not sure what that means. Maybe you can tell me what you agree or disagree with. Do you agree that it's happening? That's it's caused by humans? That it's causing, and will continue to cause, major climate events that will harm us? That we ought to take serious action to address it (and should have done so decades ago)? Where are you on this spectrum, exactly? I find it strange that you think my sources have zero value. Again, they're secondary sources, but they cite their own primary sources, which are reliable and which you can check for yourself if you're inclined. What standard of evidence do you require before believing something? I strongly doubt that you apply the same standard of evidence that you apply to climate change to anything else. That signals motivated reasoning to me. What is this about an "entitlement complex"? Asking someone to cite sources to defend their position, especially on a scientific question, isn't "entitlement", it's a perfectly reasonable request. I have fact checked, and I've come to a different conclusion that you. That's why I ask for your sources: so you can correct me if I'm wrong. Also, your statement comes down to who has the burden here. In my opinion, if there's a consensus on a scientific question, then it's the person advancing the heterodox position that has the burden of supporting it with sources. The consensus is that the scientific data is overwhelming. It's up to you to show otherwise, otherwise you're the one making claims you can't back. I want people to think more critically. One of the ways they can do this is by becoming aware of the role of special interest groups in formulating public opinion. That's why I brought up the efforts by the fossil-fuel industry to sow confusion on the issue. If you're aware of this, you can learn to be suspicious of the disinformation being peddled by these special interest groups. That's not a weird thing to do, it's exactly what you do with NASA and skepticalscience.com You doubt these sources because you believe they have improper motives. The efforts of the fossil fuel industry to sow confusion about climate change isn't conspiracy, it's well documented. Obviously, it's not the whole story. I suggest you read the following article, which is excellent on this issue: https://journals.openedition.org/ejas/10305 I don't know what "speak under your own power" means.

You can easily look this stuff up and educate yourself, but it seems you choose not to, and to maintain an ill-informed opinion on the subject instead. The only reason you would do this is either because you're ignorant about your ignorance, or you have an emotional attachment to ideological presuppositions (i.e. you believe something because you want it to be true). My views on this aren't based on some naive tendency to "believe anything I'm told", it's based on evidence and the scientific consensus. Believe it or not, I'm one of those people that has actually bothered to look into the actual mechanism for human-caused climate change, so I have a basic understanding of the science, unlike 99% of people out there. Not that there's anything wrong with trusting the experts; that's a perfectly rational thing to do and people do it all the time with all sort of non-politically charged areas of science. https://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/ https://skepticalscience.com/global-warming-scientific-consensus-intermediate.htm https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_consensus_on_climate_change Wikipedia is a secondary source, but it provides its own primary sources in all of its entries. You can check those for the strength of the information on Wikipedia. If you think there's something unreliable about the primary sources Wikipedia uses in its articles on the subject, then say what those are. It won't do to just say "Wikipedia isn't reliable". If you have peer-reviewed science that contradicts those Wikipedia entries, also cite those. From your last two sentences, I suspect that you're totally ignorant of the science and just repeating talking points you've read somewhere. Be careful with your own sources. There's an active campaign of disinformation about climate change by special interest groups. Their main goal isn't to convince anyone that human caused climate change isn't real, it's just to confuse us into thinking we have no real answers. That's enough for the purposes of propaganda. It's the exact same strategy tobacco companies used to sow doubt about whether tobacco caused cancer, or that companies selling sugary products used to sow doubt about whether sugar was truly unhealthy. These strategies were very effective for a long time.	UCAIec4u7uAkf1cWjuh8638Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAIec4u7uAkf1cWjuh8638Q	1	UgxTx-NZeWMRTPHTLCx4AaABAg	John R

Just not in YOUR office. <br /><br />The simple facts at this time are that measured data shows that CO2 is not a meaningful &quot;greenhouse gas&quot; as the force feedbacks that were guessed at up until about 15 years ago have now been shown (again through physically measurable data) to not have the affects they thought and predicted. These are the people calling it hoax. Those like within the IPCC are still using computer models which are still using the now proven false force feedback effects. Those are the people still yelling that the sky is falling. <br /><br />Which is true? I go with the physical data. I&#39;m a computer programmer and I&#39;ve looked at 4 or the 6 existing compute models - they will predict an outcome based on YOUR weights and inputs. The physically measured data over the past 15 or more years has shown the weights and inputs being used to be incorrect.

In plants there is a protein called Rubisco that sets CO2 to make sugars (decreasing atmospheric CO2 concentration). This protein works with O2 also. So with high values of O2/CO2 Rubisco works with O2 making useless products for the plant. Instead, with low values O2/CO2 Rubisco works setting CO2 to make the useful sugars to grow and vital operations. However, temperature has a important role in the plant also. High temperature reduces CO2 concentration in water solution so Rubisco works making useless products again. In tropical areas some plants as corn-plants and sugarcane have developed a system to avoid the temperature effect. So these plants have a better environmental adaptation and have a competitive advantage versus others. Summarizing, there are two main forces (interrelated) having opposite effects in CO2 atmospheric concentration and therefore in climate change: O2/CO2 relationship in atmosphere and temperature. Thank you Pat for you videos.	UCXXUG1bna6fYurc3Akh_zbw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXXUG1bna6fYurc3Akh_zbw	0

But globally, most of earth&#39;s landmass is currently uninhabitable because??? It&#39;s too cold to be habitable. Look at a globe. Most of the land is close to the north polar region.

To say "co2 started at 270 PPM" is a red herring and divorced from reality. For most of the earths history co2 was way above 270 PPM. Look at any graph that uses geologic time scales and you can see it for yourself. It's ironic this guy has accused me of using copypasta from a blog which I haven't (I used my own logic based on the numbers i looked up)and then he goes on to copypasta from a blog and even links it, lol.

Warmer air can hold more water. Furthermore, water will turn from liquid to vapor and from vapor to liquid very quickly, so the amount of water vapor in the air is greatly sensitive to temperature. In other words, water vapor cannot cause warming, it can only follow and maintain it. CO2, on the other hand, stays in the air for a long time, and doesn't go down just because it is cold for a night. This means that the warming it causes is long lasting... and it will allow the air to hold more water vapor. So let's say you have air that's at 10°C. Let's assume it holds 1 arbitrary unit of water vapor. That 1 unit of water vapor will not change as long as the temperature stays the same. Now let's add a little CO2, just enough to warm the air up to 11°C. Now the air can hold more water, so water vapor goes up to 1.1 units (those are arbitrary numbers, i didn't look up the actual proportions). There is now more water, so the air warms a little more, going up to 11.8°C. The air can now hold even more water, so the amount of water vapor climbs up to 1.16 units. Then temperature will go up to 12.2°C, and water vapor to 1.19, then 12.4°C and 1.2, then the temperature stabilizes at 12.5°C and the water vapor at 1.2 units. In the end, CO2 only warmed the air by 1°C, but it caused a feedback loop that added another 1.5°C because of water vapor. And if you remove the C02, the same thing will happen in reverse, the temperature will fall so the amount of water vapor will also fall, so the temperature will fall again and etc... until the temperature and water vapor turn back to 10°C and 1 unit like we had at the start. Edit : by the way, if the problem with potholer is his sources, did you check his video "the evidence for climate change without computer models or the IPCC"?

The biggest greenhouse gas is VAPOR, CO2 is estimated to be only 0.4 of the greenhouse gases up there and most of it is produced by plant decay and volcanoes.<br />- And those idiots haven’t even take in account the biggest weather driver in our solar system, our SUN, our sun have its own cycles, and we are now in one of its grater ones, (200/400 years), every 22/23 for smaller cycles and 200, 400/500, 1000, 3600 yeas average and so on, our sun goes through a full cycle and every 11/12 (example) years we experience more heat in the high and cold on the low cycle, on the low cycle our sun produce less sun-spots, therefore we receive less radiation from our star, less heat, less radiation also means less protection from cosmic rays, caused from our planet magnetosphere get wick and our planed stays more vulnerable to cosmic radiation, this radiation is know to cause “cloud nucleation, heat earths core” and therefore more vulcanos erupting, earthquakes, floods and droughts, more sulphuric acid in earths atmosphere, less sun light and so on.<br />- So guys to let these non informative videos take you to wrong conclusion.<br /><br />- [ ] C.B	UCsBmgctdkRa1BbFeRk2bxSg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBmgctdkRa1BbFeRk2bxSg	0

Am not being sceptical, I just made my research, “I am not saying that pollution is good!” I think we should stop pollution as fast as we can, recycle whatever we can, stop using plastics, use natural materials instead.

Problem is, CO2 also leaves the atmosphere through different mechanisms, which aren't enough to process the additional 3% we release, so the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere increases as a result. It's true that plants need CO2 to thrive. They also need water. Does it mean that increasing the amount of water on the planet would be a good thing? Of course it wouldn't, it would flood islands and coastal cities. CO2 is the same, you don't want more than you already have. Vapor depends on the air's temperature. If the aire is warmer, it can hold more water vapor. CO2 increases temperature by a bit, which leads to warmer air, which lead to more vapor. It's called a feedback loop. The sun has been cooling for the last few decades, while the temperatures have been rising. Cosmic radiations do not cause eruptions, earthquakes, floods nor droughts, and it's even dubious whether it actually has an effect on clouds... Please learn how to check your sources, all you have to do is figure out where they get their information and then check that they didn't get it wrong or lie about it.

Dealing with the personal and emotional ramifications of climate change is a personal thing that everyone has to deal with. I think we need to grieve what we've lost and are losing. This is hard, and its a process. We need feel all the feelings and let them go, you know? As parents we can help our children with this. This is something that we as a civilization are just starting to talk about, and its going to take time. There's also more and more professional psychologists aware of these issues and who can help! Personally, and most scientists I know, are hopeful people. How our civilization reacts to these hard times is entirely up to us. Will we build walls, and keep each other down? Or help and hold each other through this? This is the choice before us. We're not going to all die. There will be tough times ahead, but it doesn't need to be apocalyptic. We are at a key juncture now however: what we do in the next ten years will determine a lot. Are we wise, and mobilize enough to decarbonize our economies in the next decade? Do we start planning today, for the future tomorrow? Or do we keep doing what we've been doing for 30 years and deny and delay? I live in Canada and the student school strike was a huge source of hope and energy. Extinction Rebellion is a part of this too. We can absolutely change our trajectory with enough concerned, committed, and conscious citizens engaged.

My younger daughter has made the decision to not have any children unless/until the climate issues are dealt with. That's how afraid of it she is. Meanwhile I have an older daughter and 2 little grandchildren and it's so unsettling to imagine what many are describing being left to them. I guess my question would be, are there any actual climate scientists who DON'T think we're basically all gonna die and doom and gloom? DO we have a real chance to fix it?

He seems to be pretty clearly on the global warming side. There is a guy named Tony Heller who is his polar opposite on the deniers side. I think if someone knew very little about the debate (and was politically neutral) and watched all of Potholers videos, he would fear for his future. The opposite could be said about Hellers videos. I would love to see a debate at a truly unbiased forum to discuss this topic. Unfortunately in the present political climate, that won't happen.

Very few sceptics call it a hoax or a myth so really, you&#39;re just strawmanning. If you want to claim mankind is causing the change then you have to be able to demonstrate that natural forces are not doing it and frankly we don&#39;t know enough about natural forcings. Some things have zero predictive value, like heatwaves. While it is true about the recent heatwaves being in the last 20 years, this would be expected for warming due to any cause, it&#39;s literally the same as saying that Summer is warmer than Winter. If the planet dived into a full blown Ice Age (which it will) tomorrow, the statement would still be true. Further, talking about 128,000 extra deaths from heat is scary until you understand that cold killed an extra 60,000 people in the UK alone last year. You&#39;re only telling half the story.

A warmer planet will allow us to grow crops in places we have never been able to grow them before, Hunger will be a thing of the past. Also the United Nations agenda 21 claims we will ALL go extinct if we do not eliminate a percentage of the population. So maybe thinning the herd a bit will save us from total extinction. It&#39;s all pretty complicated. My personal feeling is that mother nature seems to be doing a pretty good job taking care of the planet. We were never meant to be here forever and we won&#39;t be. EVERYTHING COMES TO AN END SOMEDAY, People, Animals, Countries, and even Planets come to an end sooner or later. And there is nothing you can do that can change Mother Natures plan , So just relax .

People differ.&quot; No. This is no longer a legitimate argument. It&#39;s science vs BS. <br />There are basically two kinds of climate deniers. Those with vested interests in fossil fuels who know better and lie about it. And radical right-wingers (it&#39;s almost always political) who simply toe the party line with no real understanding but simply parrot the same tired and long debunked talking points and misinformation often accompanied by politically motivated insults and vulgarities.

Either internal like due to massive volcanic eruptions and human activity or external like meteor impacts and most improtantly the Milanchovich cycles and Sun activity which cause the ice ages. <br /><br />But to put it into perspective, the next ice age is now very likely to not happen due to the warming effect. Everyday we dump massive amounts of CO2, Methane and others on the atmosphere, we&#39;re thickening it and making the Earth warmer. We can quantify the change and we know how much GHG (Green House Gases) we emmit and how much GHG mother nature emmits. Numbers are rough estimates but they exist. So we can quantify how much are we contributing to the Green House Effect. The 70% figure seems close to reality. But that is only a part of climate change you&#39;d have to factor in all the feedback loops.<br /><br />This is a no brainer issue as soon as you learn the science.

With current technology nuclear power is the only reasonable way forward (lowest C02 emissions) and yet most governments will not contemplate this solution.

I thought it was more like &quot;if we don&#39;t change within 12 years, damages are irreversible&quot;.<br /><br /><br />And the statement on scientists that only surround themselves with people that agree with them is really wrong; A fundamental aspect of the scientific process is what we call &quot;peer reviewing&quot; and among scientists, it is always great and thrilling to prove someone wrong but also to prove oneself wrong. When there are mistakes in a paper, don&#39;t worry, there will be hordes of positively opportunistic scientists that will tackle the mistakes.<br /><br />You can&#39;t fathom how the scientific community is amazingly ruthless, every published paper is assaulted by other scientists trying to find problems.<br /><br /><br />Although, I totally agree that the subject has been corrupted by politics, It shouldn&#39;t be left vs right.

I would add to that that people's bias greatly effects what's published and what is "acceptable". These scientists have careers, so there will be politics. For many issues they have to appeal to their bosses' perspectives and the dominant cultural understanding that is acceptable with their peers. So if they come with something against that they will be taking a risk. Not only that but for a lot a lot of scientists, publishing articles and research is just about their career advancement. They are less interested in the truth, and more interested in numbers, titles, and connections to get ahead.

And that kinda is the cherry picking to your advantage. That way you chose a (sometimes even irrelevant) topic to not talk about the main message, but instead about whatever you wanted to. And that went partly to conspiracies. Conspiratorial in a way that you seem to trust scientific research only to a point where it fits in your own world view. Disregarding the fact, that a scientific consensus of 97% of papers from all over the world agrees on at least partially manmade climate change. That means you are thinking, the vast majority of scientists observing that issue is lying to us purposely. That, by definition, is a conspiracy theory. The case of you distrusting almost every researcher on that topic is implying ill will on their side. Being able to assume a conspiracy of that scope, you need to be full of hate. But that's just my opinion, man. Maybe you're just egocentric. You distrust the mainstream opinion and need to find your own research. So now to your "facts": When I talked about rising CO2 levels, you said I am alarmist. "They are rising at a low rate and it's completely due to natural climate change." Scientists have been warning about this for many years, and state that they have been rising at an alarming rate. They probably want all those green energy big company bribery money, hmm. I wonder if you look at the same charts I do, it is actually quite a lot, very fast and started with the industrial age. So you already said, climate change is real- but not man made. Still, you are incisting on global average temperature increase messuring being wrong, since the messured places in big cities are missleading. Good point, you single-handedly outsmarted an army of researchers, nullifying a big part of many experienced peoples lifes work. But hey, how could they think of advanced stuff like that. You could listen to anecdotal evidence from all over the world though, it's getting pretty hot. Furthermore you deny increasing numbers of climate change related immigration- stating vegetation on the planet has a good time and people who struggle with that would have struggled before. There is a lot of farmland in Africa, believe it or not. But the regions now unsuitable for farming are in increasing, and that is the problem. At that point I must admit, with the numbers of immigration and reasons for it these days, there isn't much focus on those. But they exist, and they will grow. I know that from own experience, I don't blame you for not being aware or ignoring that one. Regarding glaciers and permafrost melting though, your explanation is arctic poles shift and wrong information: Ice sheets are growing faster than melting. Simply ignoring the fact, that those glaciers did not melt in thousands and thousands of years now shrinking within the span of a human lifetime to almost nothing. Ignoring the fact, that ice sheets melt much faster than glaciers or permafrost. Ignoring, that those "growing icesheets" are growing temporarily because of melting permafrost cooling the water around it down. The arctic pole shift got faster in the last century, that's right. The north pole was shifting slowly towards Canada for quite a while, now it's rapidly moving *back* towards Russia. That can neither be the reason for arctic or antarctic ice melting, nor for glaciers melting all over the world. Northern Russias ice and glaciers in Europe are now a tiny bit closer to the northpole, but are still shrinking at an alarming rate. That's not me claiming that, those are scientists warning. Still, I have been to glaciers in the alps and seen the difference since I was a kid with my own eyes. You can do that too. If you want to compare the actual size to photografs of it fifty or a hundred years ago- that's possible, and they had no photoshop back then. You called Paris climate agreement an economic disaster. Now guess what, I don't like it either. And of course it's super expensive. But this is a discussion of global leaders regarding an existential crisis of our species, rooted on the results of scientific research from all over the world, trying to find a solution to a massive problem. You actually think that politicians willingly agree to hurt their economy big time on a nonsense problem. You do think, the warning scientists who got them there are just the retard scientists while the serious ones stayed at home like you did. You are ignorant enough to think the smart guys are only those, who think like you do. That is a painful overestimation of your intellect. I don't claim to be a smart guy, but I like to hear explanations to understand problems if I can. If I can't, I trust the majority of people that do understand it. In case of climate change though, you don't even need to understand every detail to understand the risk. This video here is a good example, it breaks the topic down for the dummiest dummy. Understanding the risk, the urgency is necessary to actually do something against it. People like you, talking it down with false facts and cherry picked arguments are actually the biggest threat to the human race. I bet I lost you already. If you are still here, please note that I don't want to attack you personally. I just can't stand the fact how many people actively work on stopping climate change activism. If you don't believe in a climate crisis, fine, but what is your gain on keeping the current state? You acknowledged the problems with pollution and waste, you said we have to do something against it, yet you were downplaying me when I just wanted to convince about exactly that. We can't keep the status quo, stop argue were there is nothing to argue.	UCNvAS5zB6cOJdCv--uSJZlQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNvAS5zB6cOJdCv--uSJZlQ	1	UgypKkmIEP97sqEFg3l4AaABAg	Mike Gubisch

So, people have to consider that when they are going to vote their government. I cannot raise awareness by telling what's already done, so I obviously try to sound alarming. As you YOURSELF mentioned, pollution and waste are problems. Individuals can't do anything against it, so it has to be a political issue. Now there is the biggest moron ever in the white house who left Paris climate agreement, Germany wanted to be leading country in green energy and is now scaling back to coal and fucking UK is derping around with Brexit while every one else has at least some sort of right wing problems aswell. In short I answered on "is climate change danger?" with "jea, don't ignore it". You not being able to agree with AT LEAST that statement is just sad. Sorry for you, hope you get better soon.

Still, you haven't said anything about the feedback loop. Which, BY DEFINITION, will turn the planet unhabitable if we can't stop it in time. After all you said, it seems to me like we could actually agree on that - since you mentioned the problems with waste and pollution we need to take care of. So, if we don't, if we just continue or even accelerate the pollution, if we get that global average temperature to a point it just gets out of control: At that point, a warmer ocean melts even more ice, the warmer water expands to a point were coast lines gets flooded, more heat gets absorbed and greenhouse gases keep infrared in the atmosphere to just accelerate all that even more; just the WORST CASE SCENARIO. We don't want that. Right?	UCNvAS5zB6cOJdCv--uSJZlQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNvAS5zB6cOJdCv--uSJZlQ	1	UgypKkmIEP97sqEFg3l4AaABAg	Mike Gubisch

That is a complete misrepresentation of the scientific consensus's position on global climate change. I've argued with J_P elsewhere. It seems he has a pet theory regarding carbon which apparently trumps every other line of evidence regards human induced climate change. Go figure.

Pollution and waste are just some of the factors why it is happening. And hell, THAT IS why I am alarmist, those things need to get sorted out and they don't as of now. There is a garbage island the size of Texas in the Pacific. I am no scientist and I do not claim to be, and I did not ask you to believe me. I asked you to believe science research. Scientists have been warning about manmade climate change for decades. You are just pointing at what I might got wrong and ignore the real message... CO2 levels are rising rapidly. Glaciers are melting with record speed. The less permafrost there is, the faster the rest melts. Sealevels are rising. All of those got significally enhanced or even started since the industrialisation. You cannot argue with any of that, those are facts you can check or even see yourself without being a scientist. And those are just a few examples which still have drastic effects. Now deaths from climate change. That same time frame got deserts to grow rapidly. I lived in Maroua, Cameroon for several years. You actually see the difference climate change made on the land in my lifetime. The downfall in rain period is probably the same, but due to higher temperatures and less vegetation to soak up the water, it stays way shorter until it evaporates. That's a huge problem already. Haven't seen myself, but heard and can imagine how that is in already hotter regions of the earth... The people in Africa and South America are fleeing in "caravans" as Trump puts it. Reasons are different, but some just cannot live as they did due to climate. Many of those immigrants do not reach their destination, I blame at least some on climate change since that was the reason they started the journey. But if you don't want to count them, there were a lot more wildfires in the USA. Well, that's not the only place which burn faster due to dry vegetation and hot air. A friend of mine is development aid worker in Africa and tries to help inland farmers which barely get by. Sure, that might be the case for a long time already - but their situation gets worse. You have to count at least some of them as victims of climate change. Deny it as much as you want. You're right, the earth isn't going to die. But humans will have less habitable space every year. This has started already and its going to get faster. The feedback loop is real. You didn't even deny that. I am alarmist of triggering that. Even if we don't, there will be millions of deaths with direct connection to climate change. We should try keep those numbers as low as possible, that's all I am asking for.

But it's heavier than helium, it stays within our atmosphere. That means it creates a greenhouse effect. The heat doesn't get trapped by molecules, it gets reflected by our atmosphere. Like a greenhouse garden. Heat gets in, doesn't get out. That's the problem. I am alarmist, true. It is a very alarming concern. But which are the words I used that sound so bad? Sorry, I am no native speaker. Thing is, as I wrote, climate change is a feedback loop, once it gets rolling, it doesn't stop. And we CANNOT stop it then. Now (as I said) the real effects might not be in your lifetime - but there are already people dieing from climate change. That will get more. If you have kids, those will see the effects first hand and maybe already die from it. If you do not believe me, that's fine. But then, do your research, some of the smartest guys on the planet say exactly that. Maybe trust them? So jea. I am alarmed.

That is an estimated time frame until the global average temperature rises by 1,5°C. Now, if you think that isn't that much... It is. If you have a fever of 40°C it's high, at 41,5°C it is deadly. Kinda similar to the earth in this case. If we reach that point, the damage done to the planet is not only irreversible - it becomes an unstoppable feedback loop! Just a couple of problems, not even close to everything: By raising carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the atmosphere, the global average temperatures goes up, which melts the ice on the poles, greenland, russia, etc. Trapped in this ice for thousands of years, there is a lot of CO2 - which when freed will accelerate the temperature rise, hence faster permafrost melting. Ice, as a bright surface, does reflect a lot of the suns heat back into space. The more it melts, the less heat gets reflected and more heat gets absorbed by the earth or water, so temperatures are rising even faster. When the earth gets warmer, deserts grow (which they do for a long time already). That means less vegetation, which is needed desperatly for it's photosynthesis. Trees need water and CO2 to create O2, the air we breathe. With less trees, more of the CO2 we have in our atmosphere will stay there. Another big part of photosynthesis is plankton. This is the blue planet for its big oceans and they are full of it. Most of the vegetative plankton needs cold water though and exists in the arctic ocean. With melting ice and warmer oceans, that might be unhabitable pretty soon. Also, all the melted ice will raise the sealevel and destroy many human habitats as well. This will get enhanced by hotter climate and stronger hurricanes & other natural disasters. Which will lead to more immigration and social & political problems. But that's another topic on its own. TLDR: Jea, global warming is devastating. If we continue like we do, we will definetly reach a point where humankind cannot do anything else than wait for certain death. That might not be in your lifetime - but the tipping point is.	UCNvAS5zB6cOJdCv--uSJZlQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNvAS5zB6cOJdCv--uSJZlQ	1	UgypKkmIEP97sqEFg3l4AaABAg	Mike Gubisch

It was founded by and is run by people with exclusively financial backgrounds. Their eventual goal is to assign everyone on the planet an individual carbon footprint which will be monitored on your smartphone' If you want to exceed your footprint -say by flying abroad on holiday - you will have to buy in extra carbon certificates on the open market which they control. Try their website. It's a real humdinger. As well as scary cartoons to frighten schoolkids there is a clear message of intent to those who want to sign up on the deal. Their financial backgrounds are available on Google. One of them was an Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year and another one did some deal selling the yuan off against some other currency which was hailed as a master-stroke. None of them could give a toss about the environment and nor, so it is said, does Greta. She was one of the winners of an essay competition they organised to find the right "face" for their scam. They then pretended they had found her in her lonely vigil outside the Swedish parliament building or whatever. They are all, including Greta, from wealthy Swedish families who pay lip-service to socialism but really care only for the Kroner. (Greta really is a distant descendant of Arrenhuis by the way, but Sweden is a small country and that's neither here nor there.)

Although, of course, you have your own unique viewpoints that don't represent everyone out there who doubts the mainstream narrative on climate change. But I hadn't considered the potential profitability of climate change, by making carbon emissions a traded commodity, before. That's an interesting thing to consider. Honestly, I'd prefer that your conspiracy theory is correct instead of the mainstream narrative because then it would just be another way companies screw us over, rather than an potential existential threat.

I think only time will tell which school of thought is correct. I can see no way in which man-made C02 levels will ever be reduced to any significant degree and therefore if the "hotter" versions of the climate models are correct then we will all die, which will settle matters quite thoroughly. On the other hand I do believe it likely that the role of C02 has been considerably exaggerated. The model of the atmosphere created by Arrenhuis has become such an icon that it is almost sacrilege to question the results of experiments based upon it. I disagree entirely with your (1) and (2). (1) What has happened is that back in the late 70's the prospect of increased global warming became fashionable - because the Earth was indeed getting warmer following a cooling period of some 30 years. It was then discovered that atmospheric CO2 was rising, due to man-made emissions. Put this beside the hallowed theorems on the reaction of carbon to infra-red and -bingo! It is at this point that I become a conspiracy theorist. Not a bad thing to be if there really is a conspiracy. Practitioners of the black art of hedge fund dealing recognised a golden opportunity. By persuading governments to restrict carbon emissions a scarcity value is created. The same principle applies, oddly enough, to carbon in another form -diamonds. Diamonds are as common as dirt. It is only because their supply is restricted that they have any value. So it is now with carbon emissions. They can be traded, and they are being traded- at considerable financial gain. There's big money here and big money talks very loudly indeed. The academic grants system encourages scientists to keep the ball rolling and discourages them from questioning the AGW doctrine. The Connollys, incidentally, jumped ship from the system when they realised they would only get grants to repeat research, not try new approaches. (2) The idea of a sinister fossil fuel industry promoting anti AGW propaganda is just laughable. Who makes the expensive videos and pays rent-a-gob TV personalities to front them? Who makes all the scary cartoons and computer graphics? Who's got practically the entire western world's media companies in their pocket? The hedge funds do. George Soros and his cronies. If the fossil fuel industry wanted to undermine AGW science you think they'd do better than pay Tony Heller or frolly1000 or than nice lady from Friends of Science, wouldn't you? Naah. The fossil fuel boys have their bases covered. They're in on the act too. The scam has only the still, small voices of reason to worry about. That and the weather of course.

I guess we disagree about the facts, and about the reliability of the sources we're using. That's a tough one to reconcile. I found critiques of CO2Science and Ronan Connolly. I have no reason to be suspicious that Ronan Connolly and CERES aren't good faith sources that aren't coming to the same conclusion as the 97% of climate scientists, but CO2Science is more suspect: https://www.desmogblog.com/center-study-carbon-dioxide-and-global-change Obviously I also think Ronan Connolly and CERES are wrong about the science, but at least they don't appear to be wrong on purpose. As for falsification of data by climate scientists and journalists, if you compare the motives of activists, governments, and scientists to those of the fossil fuel industry, I'm much more suspicious of the latter. Consider the following: (1) Does it make more sense that activists and environmental groups, in concert with the overwhelming majority of climate scientists, would all dishonestly falsify and promote the idea of global warming to the world, in order to achieve... I'm not sure, exactly? Bigger government? Fear? or... (2) Does it make more sense that the fossil fuel industry would spend some of its enormous profits to pay anyone they can find to sow doubt on global warming, in order to protect their own profits, exactly the same way the tobacco companies did for decades (and is well documented)?

In my universe the arctic is getting warmer at the moment, fulfilling a long established cycle. It is now in roughly the same state as it was about 90 years ago and can be expected to begin cooling pretty rapidly very soon. The ice over the North Pole area is only about eight feet thick, but then it's always been like that The ice in the antarctic usually shifts about quite a bit and right now ice sheets in the west have reduced and thinned but have grown thicker in eastern areas. We think this is all to do with the amount of snowfall and our planet's position vis-a-vis the sun. Our sea levels aren't rising at all! Since the ice that has melted is all thin sea ice it's sort of part of the water anyway. Funny that. Also some islands which are only a few feet above sea level stubbornly refuse to sink beneath the waves. Property prices there are now booming. Our polar bears are now enjoying record numbers and are all in extremely good health. So are the seals on which they feed. In fact there are so many bears around that they haunt Russian townships like raccoons, clattering about in the rubbish bins at night. In my universe we have many so-called scientists who make up figures and alter data in a very reprehensible way to make it look as though it is hotter than it is. They also write pretend papers proving all this by algebra which they send around to each other. This called peer review. Many people get frightened by this. We also have people called "journalists" who enjoy re-writing these papers and making scary films out of them and silly people get even more scared still. How is it over your way?

If you look at the science, you can get a better idea of which changes have occurred already, which ones will occur, and what some likely scenarios are. Specifically: (1) Ice caps ARE melting. The process isn't going to happen overnight, it'll take decades. But on a geologic timescale it's happening in the blink of an eye; (2) Sea levels ARE rising. See (1); (3) Polar bears ARE endangered by climate change. See (1); (4) I agree it seems unlikely snow would go away altogether, but I haven't looked at the models and how the planet might be hundreds or thousands of years from now if we continue on the same path; (5) Climate refugees are likely. Just look at a map of projected sea levels covering low-lying areas, and the years when these areas might become flooded. There's an interesting article on which areas will be affected first: https://www.theguardian.com/cities/ng-interactive/2017/nov/03/three-degree-world-cities-drowned-global-warming; (6) There have already been record-breaking temperatures, and it's well-documented. A hot summer won't necessarily hurt anyone right now (although it has in some places), but as the planet continues to heat, some areas might become unlivable. Here's an article on already-broken records: https://time.com/5652972/july-2019-hottest-month/; (7) There HAVE been crop failures, but it hasn't been too serious yet. Apparently the worst hit area is Europe, which is obviously going to be more resilient than poorer areas of the world: https://insideclimatenews.org/news/27072018/summer-2018-heat-wave-wildfires-climate-change-evidence-crops-flooding-deaths-records-broken So to answer your question, in my universe (i.e. reality), there's already been a lot of bad signs. Obviously, since we keep adding greenhouse gasses to the atmosphere, and because there's a lag between the gasses being in the atmosphere and the full effects of warming, these things will get much worse. I'm surprised you're not aware of this. It's fairly easy to just use google and find out about it.

My point is that the well-worn argument that we shouldn't trust climate scientists on climate change predictions because they can't predict the weather on any given day, is a very bad one. It looked like you were making that argument. Climate and weather aren't the same, and pinpointing what the weather will be on a specific day is harder than figuring out what the climate will be over a longer time span. As a general rule, the more precise your prediction must be, the more likely it is that you could get it wrong.

So what is a heatwave, does the global average need to be hotter or just a large region? During the 30's the US had many times when massive numbers of people died due to the heat, many people migrated to escape from weeks of temperatures over 100F every day....the "dustbowl" was partly the result of this heat and dry. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb8EAXWIyXU https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuWarD5jLtc https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxkOIveLDLc https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fB4UpumI9XQ	UCNTQi9JJCGrw-7xfHaIo9KQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNTQi9JJCGrw-7xfHaIo9KQ	1	UgykdOmi-wZg6qayTv54AaABAg	Pete

Volcanoes emit only 0.5% of the greenhouse gas that humans emit (yearly basis). The scientific understanding of climate change is really very strong now, with strong coherence between theory, predictions and observations, and an absence of viable alternative explanations. <br /><br />Q2. There is ample evidence of the fossil fuel funded FUD-campaign on climate change. Watch this documentary: <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vM_0kRoRgr0">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vM_0kRoRgr0</a><br /><br />Or read/watch Merchants of Doubt. <br /><br />Q3. There&#39;s no point in organising a debate like you mentioned. The deniers have been proven wrong time and time again, yet they keep spouting the same made-up nonsense arguments. E.g. &#39;Climate has always changed&#39; doesn&#39;t mean that our present emissions cannot warm the climate right now. It&#39;s just not a logically sound argument. And so every argument can and has been debunked, but they don&#39;t care at all.	UC4tfwgCy-BmgY3FjoU4fjxQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4tfwgCy-BmgY3FjoU4fjxQ	0

They don't get in bed with politicians. Real scientists show up and debate their ideas. Real scientists don't manipulate data to come to their absurd hypothesis. Real scientists don't tax others to their beliefs. Your science gangsters were the same ones preaching about an ice age coming back in the 70s. Real scientists that would truly believe in your junk science would plant trees, build nuclear power plants, stop massive migration to a first world economy, propose multi family living units, be against inefficient stop lights and traffic jams, would be for less diversity because a diverse population trusts less and has all energy into getting along instead of furthering mankind's progress, a prosperous nation has the will to advance not tear down a first world to a third world. So many other countless examples and how it is an obvious fake. Realize it or not but the hypocrisy shows that it is a way to tear down a nation and make a few rich in the process. Al Gore lied so fucking much in his propaganda movies when he joined the green gangsters it just solidifies that it was about nothing more than power. I don't care what you believe, but after watching hundreds of videos from both sides I know that there is no way on earth that you are right. The earth is greener since we have been taking satellite pictures of it. That alone proves that mother nature doesn't care about your fake science. The percentage of carbon dioxide emitted is so minuscule compared to how much of the atmosphere it would be like using a little bottle of food coloring and expecting the ocean to turn purple from it.

Much of the increase in age is due to medicine and vaccines. We used to lose around 1/3 of our children before they turned 5, now most survive. Women in Europe and other Western regions in the 1880s died of "Childbed" disease in about 1 in 12 pregnancies. Why do people think widowers with children needed Governesses to look after the kids? Now we have a much better survival rate and people are commonly living into their 90s. A great time to be alive.

Small changes in natural effects such as total solar radiance, cloud cover etc. rapidly overwhelm human contributions. Study the quantum mechanics of it, the spectral absorption of IR radiation from earth due to CO2 saturates and the more there is the less effect the additional CO2 has. CO2 greenhouse effect is logarithmic-ally declining. Thats one reason why there can be no run away CO2 greenhouse effect, because is has such a thin window in IR absorption frequencies which are mostly overlaid by H20 absorption which is 20 times more potent as a green house gas. The Martian atmosphere is 95% CO2 but the average temperature is -60C. If you think climate change is due to mankind, have a look at planets where there are no humans and you will see some truly radical climate change, nothing to do with humans there.

This video does NOT mention the fact that the oceans have 33,000 mega tonnes of dissolved CO2 and when the oceans heat even slightly due to Pacific Decadal and Atlantic Decadal Oscillations some of this CO2 will come back out of solution into the atmosphere. There are 750 mega tonnes of CO2 in the atmosphere which equals 0.041% and we add about 6.8 megatonnes a year. ALL plant life depends on this 0.041%. In the past earth&#39;s atmosphere has been as high as 0.6% CO2. The higher the earth&#39;s CO2 level, the better plants grow.<br />Question - How is it in the fossil fuel industry&#39;s interests to see us all burnt to death or drowned under rising sea water in 10 or 12 years as the Climate Alarmists claim? Clearly it is in the fossil fuel industry&#39;s interests for their Customers to thrive and prosper so that they can continue to invest and make a return for their owners and shareholders.<br />There IS a group whose interests are in promulgating the Climate Alarmists point of view and that is the communists who strive for the end of Western civilisation. The communists have infiltrated most establishments and show their policies in the United Nations with their Sustainability policy which calls for One World Government, State control of ALL resources, Control of ALL production, State ownership of everything and reduction in the world population from 7.5 billion to 1 billion, or less.<br />The IPCC gets a mention here, but what IS NOT SAID is that by its Charter, the IPCC is to only look for evidence of Human Caused Climate Change. Do Google search to confirm. The IPCC can and does refuse evidence of NATURAL Caused Climate Change. Ref. YouTube video by Dr. Fred Goldberg, Sweden.

Exxonsecrets was set up to expose the oil company spending, which was some $20 million over 10 years. Meanwhile the Greenpeace books show they were spending $40 million per year in the USA alone. I don't know if it's accusing the scientists of greed, or just realising reality; If your research isn't funded, you don't put food on the table. The simple, sad fact is that your research is more likely to get funded if you put something about "Climate Change" in the proposal. It's wrong, but in our "Publish or Perish" academic world, it's how the system works. My other point is that "oil companies" are not a thing, they are a collection of people. Maybe the rich people will "make it somehow", but are they really going to bet the lives of their grandchildren on that? What about the riggers? The retirees who own shares, the men and women who crew the ships? ALL of these people are rich and going to make it? None of them care about their children and grandchildren? It's easy to forget when we read about "big oil" or "oil companies" that they aren't a huge juggernaut, they are hundreds of thousands of people who love their children as much as any environmentalist. Do you really think that all these people would knowingly endanger the future of their children for a paycheck? And the scientists involved in the oil field are all solid empirical scientists, not theorists and modellers. Not being mean to climate scientists, but when an oil geologist gets it wrong he has to explain why he should keep his job. When a climate scientists gets it wrong, they ask for more money to "improve the model". There are zero consequences for even the most royal stuff up.

With phisycal properties of CO2 to absorb small bands of ir spectrum the amount is maxed out. That means at current co2 level, 100% of the ir energy that co2 capable to absorb, already absorbed and the rise of CO2 x 10 or x100 make no difference. H2O on the other hand absorbs much larger ir spectrum and most influential green house gas. Unfortunately politics polluted science.

True but inaccurate. Actually it is 3% of annual CO2 emission whereby the natural CO2 (97%) gets fully absorbed by boreal forrests each summer. Meaning natural CO2 remains net 0 while the 3% stays in the atmosphere permanently therefore increases the atmospheric CO2 over years. That effect can be seen clearly on the keeling curve. "With phisycal properties of CO2 to absorb small bands of ir spectrum the amount is maxed out. That means at current co2 level, 100% of the ir energy that co2 capable to absorb, already absorbed and the rise of CO2 x 10 or x100 make no difference." Not true. The CO2 saturation was a missunderstanding by Angstrom. "H2O on the other hand absorbs much larger ir spectrum and most influential green house gas." Altough H2O vapor is short living / highly fluctuating and can't really explain a global long term warming trend.

Yes, it's a "blog" site, but it supports its assertions *with* *links* *to* *primary* *sources* (how many times do I have to make this point?). Anyone reading skepticalscience, who is skeptical themselves of their conclusions, should still think for themselves by checking their sources. That applies to any secondary source. Even if that website doesn't convince you, it should be pretty obvious Richard Lindzen has an agenda. He's a member of the Cato institute, a Koch-funded libertarian think-tank. Libertarians deny climate change because it's a problem that necessitates top-down government regulation to solve, and on a world-wide scale. That fundamentally conflicts with libertarian ideology, which seeks to remove all government (for the anarcho-capitalists), or to minimize it to having only the most basic functions (for the minarchists). Lindzen is also a member of the Heartland Institute, which is known for, incredibly enough, a history of denying the negative health effects of tobacco smoking (Wow!). Richard Lindzen has made a video for Prager "University", a conservative propaganda channel with a well-documented history of spreading disinformation. Here's another good resource for debunking a clown like Lindzen: https://www.desmogblog.com/richard-lindzen J P do you really want to revive this?

Huge freshwater sea at the arctic ate all the carbon in the form of ferns. Massive growth, 24hr of sun in the summer. It was down to 500ppm by the end of it, and other colonisations by plants. There were no large herbivores after the chixolub extinction event. The earth can&#39;t change that much in 200 years, it will destroy itself. This is why we can&#39;t let them drill in the arctic. It was called the azolla event.	UCg8RO7r3l44kjhxnNl6Vh8Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg8RO7r3l44kjhxnNl6Vh8Q	0

The Great Dust Bowl in the US in the 30&#39;s is left off many published, &quot;peer reviewed&quot; papers, but that &quot;data&#39; is still reported, and with the Dust Bowl the warming trend is reversed. That&#39;s how political this topic is to the people who stand to make money from global warming. It&#39;s a great wake up call if your not truly woke.

The CO2 is not making atmosphere thicker and almost noone is saying that we are gonna die in 12 years. What is being said however is that we have very little time to do something before passing tipping point which isn&#39;t mentionned here at all. There is also no mention about how scientist get historic data about temp, CO2 and methane levels from thousands/millions of years ago and the RATE OF TEMPERATURE CHANGE (it is extraordinary compared to historical, and it started to be so after we started to burn fossil fuels on larger scale). Besides that we have quite good knowledege of why earth is not a snowball etc. and we wouldn&#39;t want to be alive in that period (and also in the period of dinosaurs) because earth wasn&#39;t suitable to our needs then. We created our civilization in stable conditions of holocene, which we are now changing. Saying we should worry in scale of hundreds of years is irresponsible. We can verify scientists past predictions with reality to see if we should worry now (and do something about it). Physics is not a thing that should be debated in a way that we are doing it.

UgyuX4g2CsY3gacXLq14AaABAg	18	3	2019-11-25 12:07:28	The Roach of Theroachea	The facts are that CO2 in the air today is far lower than the average over the life of the Earth. We can see this by tracking the CO2. The Earth began and most of the CO2 was in the atmosphere. In fact based on fossil records the CO2 was at about 7,000 parts per a million (ppm) before the Cambrian explosion happened. 7,000 ppm is the level were humans start getting a bit sleepy. Then as the world became covered with plants and animals the CO2 levels began dropping slowly. This trend basically continued right up to recent history. In recent history the scientists say the CO2 has been between 180 and 360 ppm. <br /><br /><br />Were did all the CO2 go? It went into fossil fuels or at least into the soil. Here it was either reused or transferred to fossil fuels. As a result of us losing so much of the CO2 in the atmosphere the Earth has been able to support less plant life. See when plants and animals die they go into the soil and some of that is bottled up so tight that the Earth makes fossil fuels. For much of the earth&#39;s life the CO2 concentration has gone down. But plants and animals did much better when there was more CO2 in the atmosphere. The levels were much higher when plant and animal life was much more numerous and diverse. In fact it was somewhere around five times higher than our current 400 ppm and the temperature wasn&#39;t all that different on the Earth&#39;s surface. As we burn fossil fuels all we really do is put what was once in the air back in the air. The facts are that the CO2 could climb to 10 times it&#39;s current levels and we would still be on a green, lush and thriving world.

I'll put my primary source below. https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ask-the-experts-does-rising-co2-benefit-plants1/ But in all honesty, this entire argument is a Red Herring. In general I don't even care for this argument I simply dislike the the scientific inaccuracy of it. Modern civilizations will inevitably innovate their way out of this issue by moving agricultural centers to better locations. (Basically colonizing new growing land, which i find quite immoral)Yes, A greening earth is your hobby horse not mine. The reason I dislike this argument so much is due to the rapid nature of current warming trends. The lush green world you're alluding to was around 100 million years ago, earth was much much warmer and also wetter due the the polar ice caps being melted. But projections of modern conditions don't have the ice caps melting any time relatively soon, but the earth will continue to warm and this is where the danger is. http://climateandlife.columbia.edu/2017/05/31/expect-the-wet-to-get-wetter-and-the-dry-drier/ https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2891/a-drier-future-sets-the-stage-for-more-wildfires/ Here's to your second argument regarding CO2 lagging temperature. (Which is a very well understood and expected aspect of climate science.) A video from a former geologist turned science communicator explaining this common misrepresentation of the science. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL18_kiDUck If TL;DW, the gist of his video is explaining that this is not only well understood but *expected!* Solar forcing begins raising the temperature, this melts ice and also releases CO2, the melting of ice increases earth's albedo, as earth's albeo increases and further raises the temperature more and more CO2 is released, then after enough CO2 accumulates in the atmosphere it keeps the warming cycle going. (positive feedback) Here is an incredibly detailed article discussing why we know that temperature rise leads CO2, but also why we know that CO2 can lead temperature rise too. https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11659-climate-myths-ice-cores-show-co2-increases-lag-behind-temperature-rises-disproving-the-link-to-global-warming/ Here is almost a million years showing the overwhelming correlation of CO2 and temperature. https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/global-warming/temperature-change This is a playlist of 50 some videos that clearly, logically, and scientifically answer just about any question you have or argument you might be able to conjure up about climate change. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL82yk73N8eoX-Xobr_TfHsWPfAIyI7VAP But back again to your first argument about earth greening. (Which to reiterate says nothing about global crops yields.) https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2017EF000690 It brings me to something you said in an earlier comment, "I am also sure that one of the most generous nations in the world will be there to assist them..."

Literally nations with *hundreds* of *millions* starving, hell even inside the US we have somewhere around *40 million* people who struggle to feed themselves. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunger_in_the_United_States#/media/File:US_Food_Insecurity.png When it takes 14 years or more for a US city like New Orleans to be rebuilt and recover from a hurricane, what evidence can you provide to back your assertion that, "Like I said, No one will need to displaced.

The W.I.S. is not evidence or argument for or against my original arguments. My first original argument was that CO2 is not dangerous to mankind or the Earth and in fact is a key component in the earth becoming a greener and healthier place. My second original argument was that if there is a correlation between CO2 and temperature it is CO2 follows temperature. Your other 3 links are about projected sea level rise. These 3 are climate alarmist propaganda and do not produce evidence or argument against my original arguments. Have you noticed they only show the past sea level rise back to about 1970. This was the earliest you could stretch the start of the industrial age when we started burning copious amounts of fossil fuels. CO2 levels started rising before 1800, temperatures started rising a few years before 1910, and sea levels started rising before 1800. The facts are that you are being deceitful and the proof is here; "provided almost a dozen sources". You have provided nothing to counter my assertions. You have only tried to defend your own straw man argument and when you realized that my argument against that made more sense than yours you reverted to the tactic of projecting your own argument's failings upon me and my counter arguments. I would encourage you to do something else. Search for the truth. I have given you many places to start.

If an argument is bad then simple logic will be able to counter. If an argument or statement is scientifically inaccurate then it can be countered by scientific fact. You are correct that we can agree that the world is not ending and that humanity will survive what may come. Wind and solar are worse for the environment than fossil fuels. They consume more power than they produce, require backup, and are made from . Nuclear does have potential but for the immediate future hydro power has the most potential with the fewest risks. I think we need to make sure that energy is efficient with as few interruptions as possible. Storage is not a huge priority for me partially because the huge environmental impact battery storage systems have. If a new, innovative and far less impact storage system was possible I could see implementation of some storage into the system. This whole paragraph however is a huge straw man argument that makes your post seam disingenuous. I view none of my opponents as enemies. I also do not look at you as trying to be deceitful. I believe you are following your research. Were I hope to help you is to get you to dig below the surface which from the information is the only information you have researched. Surface information is often heavily swayed by popular opinion. Surface information also rarely contains the facts that you need to strengthen your arguments. The one thing that you seam to have gone in depth on is geological in nature and then you seam to have tried to tie that information to the current climate. You have yet to offer any evidence of any of my claims being a fallacy or even that the argument is bad. I welcome any evidence that you might have. If you truly thought my arguments had no merit than they wouldn't be eating at you so. If my argument was so based on polarizing rhetoric from both sides then it would not show any consistence or depth.

My views are not underdeveloped in any way and you are attacking the validity of my argument instead of the substance because you see that it makes sense. Warmer temperatures do not necessarily mean more tropical climates, but when you add increased CO2 and increased precipitation it is a very likely outcome. Since all three of these things would be added in the scenario you fear so much, you are going to have more tropical climate around the world. CO2 is literally the air that plants breath. Food? Not so much, that would be the enriched soil, although CO2 can also be useful to plant growth when absorbed through the soil as well. CO2 also provides most of the carbon for all carbon based life on Earth. Meaning all life on Earth. I do understand that the land owners of the coasts of this country are not impoverished. They are plenty wealthy enough to protect their assets and in turn protect the assets of those farther inland. It requires no money to move if you have very little to move. You just use your vehicle, or barrow your friends, load it up and head on out. I have a family of 8 and we all live off of less than 45k a year so I would imagine I have a good grasp of those without wealth. Your grasp on those without wealth seams questionable since you look at them as being helpless. The fact is those without wealth are the ones that the wealthy are going to be paying to protect the assets of the wealthy. As for it being a global issue that will hurt people in other places, I am sure they can move much faster than a foot and a half in 30 years. I am also sure that one of the most generous nations in the world will be there to assist them with that move whether they want them there or not.

I'm honestly certain that both of us could agree that the world isn't ending and that humanity will live on through even the worst of the worst case scenarios. I personally fight for alternative energy and more specifically I fight for them to become for efficient and eventually replace fossil fuels. I promote nuclear power, I think liquid fuel reactors need to be invested into for more reasons than I could possibly list. I think we need to invest in energy storage, basically carbon nanotube technologies. All in all, I am not some mysterious deceitful enemy for you to fight. I've done years of research into the topic of climate science, I as well as thousands of others can explain why your arguments are fallacious but you keep retreating into your bad arguments as if they have any real merit. I don't expect you to take my word on anything, I just wish you'd try looking more into the science facts and less into the polarizing rhetoric being spewed on both sides.

You've made the mistake of equivocating "warmer temperatures" with "Tropical Climates", this simply won't be the case for much of the planet. You're favorite argument seems to be "CO2=PlantFood" , and again this is a really misleading oversimplification of climate and agriculture. https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ask-the-experts-does-rising-co2-benefit-plants1/ https://www.yaleclimateconnections.org/2013/07/uprooting-the-carbon-dioxide-is-plant-food-argument/ https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/sep/19/new-study-undercuts-favorite-climate-myth-more-co2-is-good-for-plants As for you taking issue with my claims of impoverished people being affected, you do understand that large coastal cities have *absurd* levels of income inequality? Something akin to 5% of the people in these cities either own the property or account for 98% of the wealth in the city. The rest of these people are living paycheck to paycheck, renting apartments, and unable to cover an unexpected $500 expense just like most Americans. People can't sell what they don't own and can't move if they don't have the money to. And again let me add context this issue; this problem extends beyond your narrow North American lense into deeply impoverished and war-torn nations. Not everyone this problem is going to affect will be so privileged as to spend their way out of it.

Why would this cause drought or reduced plant life? Higher CO2 in the atmosphere increases plant life and growth in plants. Crops would flourish in a warmer climate and the increase precipitation and a little human engineering, would help in maintaining more water storage on land, producing cleaner energy production, and provide irrigation systems for crops. Nature would also be benefited in larger and more expansive tropical climates. More tropical forests, given the chance to grow and flourish, would also retain more water in plant life, animal life, and large, expansive, and always full water storage on, under, and in the ground. I am not arguing geology I am arguing elevation. Regardless of how little the world has changed in the later parts of Earths life, the elevation of areas that your seaway would have to pass through is currently too high for even the most dire predictions to suggest the return of this seaway. Can you afford beachfront property? Because I am middle class and I know I can not afford beach front property. I fully reject your notion of those living even within walking distance of the coast being mostly poverty stricken. Even if they are it is their property that is keeping them poor. Selling will be quick and easy. You are talking coastal property, the value of which for an acre is in excess of $150,000 and if you find that it is a steal. Like I said, No one will need to displaced. You said we have 30 years before it will rise 1.5 ft? We can build sky scrapers in that time and your worried about us being able to raise a bit of beach a couple of feet? Farther the fact is that as little as 20,000 years by the scientists measurements ice and glacier covered nearly all of Canada. Today, we have even more coast line than we did 20,000 years ago.

(Don't confuse this with sea level glaciers like Greenland and Antarctica, which are melting by *Gigatons* every year.) This mountain glacier growth is due to the rising temperatures bringing greater moisture to higher elevations however, this is going to reverse and begin melting off as temperatures continue to rise. (Even the source you cited explains this future warming destroying the glaciers) This will cause crop failures and lack of drinking water for large communities who rely on these yearly mountain glacier melts and likely they will be forced to move. (Become climate refugees) As for the Western Interior Seaway, I'm not going to argue evidenced geologic history that's backed by millions of fossils and other geologic evidence that you'll find in many geology textbooks. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031018202006429 http://www.fossilmuseum.net/fossil-art/maps/seaway/seaway100mya.htm The general geography of of North America hasn't really changed too much in the past 100 million years, so a future Seaway due to the melting of earth's icecaps is still possible. Let me clarify that this is more along geologic timescales in the thousands of years, but is a scenario worth taking into consideration due to the longevity of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. What is most pressing is the predicted 1.5ft rise by 2050 and the predicted 2-4ft rise in sea levels by 2100. This will literally displace hundreds of millions of people in the span of a single lifetime. There is no feasible possibility that these people will simply be able to sell their property. (especially since the overwhelming majority of these people will be from poverty) Do you understand why sea level rise matters so much? It's because some 40% of the *Global Population* lives in coastal cities. So a rise of 1 meter will devastate these coastal populations, so there needs to be policies and funding set aside for aiding in this massive redistribution of people. https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimdobson/2019/10/30/shocking-new-maps-show-how-sea-level-rise-will-destroy-coastal-cities-by-2050/ https://www.globalchange.gov/browse/multimedia/projected-sea-level-rise-and-flooding-2050 https://www.globalchange.gov/browse/multimedia/projected-sea-level-rise-and-flooding-2050 https://www.nap.edu/read/13389/chapter/7	UCWQX9VOPWgO83knocgeGB5A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWQX9VOPWgO83knocgeGB5A	1	UgyuX4g2CsY3gacXLq14AaABAg	The Roach of Theroachea

Here is an article that shows exactly what I am talking about: https://www.livescience.com/48256-asia-karakoram-glaciers-stability.html There was another article that I found a month or so back but I wasn't able to find it again. It would have been better because it actually discussed how a warmer climate can and does cause glacier growth. I do not deny that glaciers are melting but I do reject the notion that this equals sea levels rising. The facts are very clear that the oceans warming increases evaporation and precipitation. The facts are also very clear that the more snow added in the mountains the the mountainous glaciers grow. The fact is also clear that the more water stored on land the less there is in the oceans. As for your Western Interior Seaway, I have serious doubts of it ever really existing. Even if it did none of the models projecting sea level rise show the return of it. The areas it would have to pass through in the northern U.S. and Canada have too high of an elevation. Besides the change here in sea level would be so slow that we wouldn't have to spend a dime to relocate anyone. Once the water got to their yard most people would relocate on their own, many would sell to business and wealthy people. Most of these would then have the capital to build up the land to maximize the potential of their beach front property. You are talking about a rate slower than 0.2" per a year.

This imbecile is making up ad hock hypotheses about water from glacial melts magically being redistributed to land and sea levels actually falling. The absolute absurdity of this drivel is migraine inducing. How hard is it for people to understand that greenhouse growers also pump in many times more gallons of water and other nutrients to keep their crops growing. We're already seeing heatwaves and forest fires due to drought, it looks like famine is the only thing they might believe if it happens to impact them directly. Most of the greening is evidence of global warming because it's coming from historically low temperature climates that are now warm enough to support plant growth.

This temperature rise warmed the oceans and caused a slight increase in CO2 in the atmosphere before we started burning fossil fuels. This is because the warming of the oceans causes them to omit most of the CO2 into our atmosphere. The oceans are also the main CO2 sink for the Earth. All human activity only accounts for 3.4% of the CO2 omissions annually.

As temperatures rise and the oceans warm cloud cover and precipitation will increase. With more moisture over the land and more cloud cover to keep the the land and glaciers cooler the glaciers on land will grow. Since more of the Earths water will now be stored on the land it is far more likely that the oceans recede rather than rise.

That is why greenhouse owners increase the CO2 in their greenhouses by at least 3 to 5 times the level outside because plants thrive off of higher CO2. If plants thrive than animals thrive. All animals rely on plants or animals that eat plants. Increased CO2, increases plant life, which increases animal life. This is a very simplified explanation of many large scale experiments, studies, and observations, but they are not popular or cool with the scorched Earthers so they are not circulated and publicized.

He has been collecting data for so long, he has original data from NASA that debunks climate change and &#39;updated&#39; NASA data that confirms climate change. <br /><br />He also had 150 years of international newspaper articles that report of global warming and catastrophic flooding and drought when CO2 levels were low. <br /><br />This video shows how easy it is to &quot;prove&quot; global warming exists, by cherry picking the start date.

Science is quite capable of coming to it&#39;s own conclusions without the help of politicians, vested interests and useful idiots. And it has come to those conclusions. The political debate needs to be about how to act, and how to act quickly enough, as a society about the vast array of nasty consequences.

There are nasa satellites that can literally monitor the radiation from the sun hitting the earth, and compare it with the amount that it radiated back into space. Just as you&#39;d expect it is being absorbed by the CO2, and we continue to put more into the atmosphere which will continue this trend. There is a plethora of evidence to support global warming, and this video puts too much laymen talk about the topic in place of the scientific evidence.<br /><br />You said in the video that one of the arguments which opposed it is that we only have records in the modern day, and nothing to compare it to, but that is false because we have many sources through which you can see earths past CO2 levels, and indicators of past climate. If you don&#39;t already know fluctuations in CO2 are largely responsible for earths changing climate, but when you have humans adding CO2 into the atmosphere you&#39;re not witnessing &quot;the natural cycle&quot; as deniers suggest. <br /><br />You also compare cigarette companies paying scientists to endorse tobacco smoking to global warming as if there is any incentive for them. Who gets a profit from paying climatologists to lie? Let me guess the companies who will tax you to breathe in the future? Not sure what conspiracies theorist made that one up but I sure see, and hear it a lot. There is a scientific consensus on this subject for a reason, and that is because the evidence for it is clear. The problem is that most civilians don&#39;t attempt to research it so that they can understand it.	UCkxNsZM-3s-rzhqfNYqwNuA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkxNsZM-3s-rzhqfNYqwNuA	0

Very often you climate alarmist types get hysterical in this way when your bubble is prodded. I've already explained why CO2 isn't a pollutant and I don't think many people say it is. As to the luxuries we have today, they are of course provided directly via the CO2 emitting fossil fuel industry one way or another, aren't they? I don't deny global warming by the way, I just don't think human activity causes it. If the current trend conforms to previous patterns it will get warmer and warmer for a couple of hundred years before a new cooling period begins. The level of carbon in the atmosphere is irrelevant. Don't forget that our lush green earth, with its oxygen breathing fauna came into being when atmospheric carbon levels were hundreds of times greater than they are today.

CO2 fall into that category. I understand that CO2 existed in earths atoms long before humans came about adding to it, but there is a certain concentration which when you surpass has detrimental effects on the environment. You need not look any further than the great barrier reef to understand the severity of impact global warming will have on various ecosystems. Global warming is not entirely based on a lab experiment that is over 100 years old as you put it, but it has been understood that CO2 was a greenhouse gas that would trap heat in the earth's atmosphere since then. The evidence for global warming is far beyond being confined to a lab. We are currently experiencing it, and the trend will only continue. Greenland ice sheets are melting as predicted in the 70s. The oceans are warming. The coral reefs dying. The sea levels rising. The increase in temperature. These are all obviously confirming what was known years ago to those who work in these fields. An experiment done in a lab showing that CO2 is a greenhouse gas doesn't suddenly become untrue when applied to the earth's atmosphere. You do realize that as I said in my original post that NASA satellites compare the infared radiation entering earths atmosphere, and measure how much was retained due to CO2, right? Scientific research shows no correlation between cosmic rays and temperature. The theory that cosmic rays causing the climate to change has not meet it's burden of proof. Lmfao. You cite einstein's paper on absorption and emission of radiation as if it helps you case. It does not. It does however help mine. You MMCC deniers are all the same. You don't understand 90% of what you're talking about. You get your "scientific evidence" from politicians, or political news outlets like fox neither of which are credible sources for science. You're seriously someone who believe that all oceanographers, glaciologists, and climatologists worldwide are intentionally deceiving you due to greed. Some giant conspiracy where somehow the absolutely massive amount of scientists are keeping quite about yet they're obviously not living in luxury, but I bet you'll claim they're paid off anyway.

The actual atmosphere appears to behave very differently - which is scarcely surprising since it is very much larger than the artificial atmospheres used for these experiments, to say nothing of being subject to cosmic rays and being on the edge of outer space. Experiments carried out in contained areas on the earth's surface do indicate that carbon instigates a procedure whereby infra-red radiation is retained or reflected back downwards. In the real atmosphere, however, recent studies have shown that carbon molecules retain infra-red photons for approximately one third of a second before disseminating them in various directions. It also appears that this procedure assists in maintaining the atmosphere in a state of thermodynamic stability, as Einstein posited it must be in his theoretical paper of 1917. The climate crisis is a gigantic scam conceived by hedge fund managers who make vast profits from trading in carbon emission permissions created by artificial restrictions imposed following such events as The Paris Agreement. The scam is supported by governments who increase revenue via carbon taxes and also by left-leaning politicians generally who see it as a way of exercising widespread control over you suckers while at the same time allowing you to feel clever and virtuous.

I guess I'm a sucker because I can understand the overwhelming evidence that human's CO2 pollution is contributing to global warming. I suppose I should by into the ridiculous unscientific claims by politicians, and media outlets like you do, or is it the conspiracy theories that you buy into? Either what I don't want to be too harsh toward an 8 year old? At least you sound 8 calling someone a "sucker", haha. You can come up with a better insult than that surely.

Then, restrict yourself to the work of real professional scientists who publish peer-reviewed articles in major science journals and the work of science journalists and writers who summarise and explain the peer-reviewed science articles. Always require references to published science to back up what a such a journalist writes. One such journalist can be found at the Potholer54 YouTube channel. He sticks strictly to peer-reviewed science. Another source of reliable summary of peer-reviewed climate science is the IPCC. Far from being alarmist in any sense, the IPCC has a definite tendency to be conservative about the peer-reviewed science it considers and summarises. If you want to know what is actually physically happening, peer-reviewed science is the key tool you have. Ignore all the rest of the BS.

Greenhouse Effect = as you add heat, there's no temperature change until the mass becomes saturated with heat. This appears as cooler highs. When heat is removed, there's no temperature change until the mass empties it's heat capacity. Greenhouse Effect is the Heat Capacity phenomenon. All gases (and liquids & solids) have heat capacity. But the amount of heat capacity differs. If you have 2 gases, the one with greater heat capacity is called the greenhouse gas.

It is also a larger heavier molecule, which tends to mean most of it will stay on the down low. But the math is complicated so the correlation between the modelled outcomes and the measured ones are not good.

I did the regression analysis on the data and found an R2 value of .26. To even a high school student, this means that the relationship between CO2 and warming is slightly possible no more. Thousands of people have done the same analysis and got pretty well the same result. Mann was asked to provide his r2 value to a court in Canada. He refused and lost his case to Tim Ball. There has been little or no warming in the past 18 years. None of the global warming terrorists has had anything to say about this.. <br />The new factor has arisen in the last couple of years. cAMS CO2 forecasts has shown that we know very little at all about the distribution or movement or effects of CO2 on the atmosphere or warming.. google it and you can see for yourself.

First, you have their "climate models" ALWAYS being wrong, claiming things will be hoter than then actually end up being. Then you have them "erasing" the Warming of the 1930's and the Medieval Warming period in order to try and claim now is "warmer than ever". Also, you have them cherry-picking short periods to try and claim something bad is occurring now be it with warming, Ice Extent, Hurricanes etc. etc. entirely ignoring the LONGER historical trends which proves their claim false. Then you have the RAW Temperature Data sets showing little Warming at all, which is entirely contrary to their final published claims. And again, the so-called "science" claimed all those "predictions" that haven't come true, so that's another thing as I showed above. Most of those "predictions" were "science" predictions, yet they ALL are false. Don't forget that the "consensus" in the 70's was Global Cooling and a coming Ice Age, then somehow they full flip from the 80's onward... On an on and on... What's occurring here isn't "science" AT ALL... it's Propaganda by a Leftist agenda to create more big government by making people permanent voters for the Left.

Their tree planting was actually so water intensive as to cause a whole host of other environmental problems, not to mention a minor change in albedo [either existant or expected, I'm actually not sure]. They technically serve your argument pretty well - don't act hastily without the whole picture, since you can cause more harm than good by accident. They incidentally serve my point well by taking their environmental problems seriously enough to warrant massive action, but it's only half-hearted [as you said with the coal plants]. I've heard [so you know it's true lol] that coke [the coal kind] cannot be substituted for steel and iron smelting, so coal plants may remain necessary. If they wanted to take actual steps to reduce their emissions, they wouldn't make a better carbon-sink, they'd look for alternatives to coke, or assist with fusion research to a greater extent. China's known for brute force, but finesse would be better. Finesse also takes time, time we may not necessarily have, so I believe the intent is to maintain a carbon sink until better alternatives arise, but that's just wild speculation. This section didn't really have a point. Probably skip this part. You and I having a love for the near-fantasy of fusion power makes me giddy, but I'm not a free market kind of guy. I could explain my leanings, but it's off topic. I'll just say that the unexpected paragons of capitalism taking the brunt of innovation costs is a welcome surprise, and I wish them the best [and also hope Bezos doesn't crack it first]. Strange bedfellows... When you mention 'how to measure and what to do with sequestered carbon' the measurement part is beyond me; I'm somewhat confident someone smarter than me has made carbon profiles for different trees for example, but that's just a wild guess. The sequestered part, if we're sticking with trees that is, would be...in the wood of those trees. Otherwise, we could make like the earth does and deposit it in sediment. I'm not too sure what you were trying to get at here, except for the paraphrased 'mandatory minimum' amount of emissions; we still need to do things that just flat-out aren't green [coke and coal example from before comes to mind], and I agree that it's somewhat of a fantasy: waiting for people smarter than me to research a problem, solve it, and implement the solution in a timely manner is unreasonable, which was what you said at the end. If it's possible, it should be done, but since it's unreasonable, we have to find an interim solution. Those last 7 words really nail down the differences we have [if I understand your position, that is]: I think we should act in the interim with the solutions we do have, while you think that this could cause it's own host of problems, and that we should wait until there's more 'absolute' solutions available. Each of these positions has some merit, but mine is easiest to criticize [China being a living example], and I feel that the reason for this is because it actually involves doing something, not doing nothing and hoping. Funnily enough, if you look at the last few sentences of the above paragraph and compare them here, it's almost as though we swapped positions, but I think that's because I misunderstood your position and await clarification! The windfarm thing is not a sticking point for me; I don't really like them [they're technically more effective at generating power when compared to solar according to a report I had to do in Grade 11, but solar has gotten better since then, so...] and fission power would obviously be the better solution rather than the capital-intensive, circumstantial wind farms. My mother is especially anti-nuclear, and I think that's from misunderstanding the sciences behind it, but how do you even begin to tell someone how safe thorium is compared to uranium? People have an irrational fear of nuclear energy because of Chernobyl and Fukushima, not understanding how irregular Chernobyl's design was, and how little damage resulted from Fukushima [it was still bad, obviously, but I think there were some naysayers disappointed in the lack of explosion]. Lastly, playing god. Obviously doing so warrants caution, since fucking it up hurts a lot more than you could reasonably anticipate, but when are you allowed to play god? And what exactly constitutes playing god? Human influence over crops is certainly a big plus for us, but say GMO and you get a dirty look, as though what we've already done is different in principal. When do you understand a system enough to play god? Most of those questions are rhetorical since getting an answer would probably lead you to "...and how well did you understand that? ...and how well did you understand THAT?" loop; eventually, we have to say 'good enough' and stamp in that fiat for the sake of action. We have different thresholds of 'good enough', and that's totally fine, but I also think these thresholds depend on the circumstances we're in: in times of [or in anticipation of] crisis, does the threshold grow more lenient or strict? I have no clue, and if there were a correct answer to that question, and if that answer was 'stricter', I think that alone would win you the argument. Very lastly, the idea of 'playing god didn't work, so let's play god more' doesn't sit too well with me; playing god is a nebulous phrase that we have an intuition for, but no ruleset of - technically anything could be playing god, and that's obviously semantics, but until we narrow that phrase down, it's technically not a counterpoint. This one was longer than expected, so I'll leave my closing remarks in the last comment. You're free to ignore it if you want, but just know that I genuinely appreciate your point of view, and at the very least, I've started seeing this problem as more of a complex than I had before.

I'm not familiar with the conditions needed to cause Venus-level warming, but that shouldn't change it being a positive feedback loop; what I mean is that we can anticipate a, say, 2c rise in temperature over 10 years' time, but even if we kept our emissions to the point where it shouldn't rise...we would still see a rise. Again, I'm not familiar enough with the concept to make any declarations, but it here's what bothers me: an X degrees rise in temperature can turn into an X+ degree rise, even when we're not making things worse [hell, we would probably still see a rise in temperature even if we went uber-green, just from the inertia of the change alone]. It doesn't have to go all the way to Venus to be too much for us to handle, all that + has to do is be just big enough that we can't capture it's effects with green projects, and the longer we take to get started, the more time that + has to gather some momentum. In fairness, I can readily concede that there is some threshold of growth rates that are [for lack of a better term] harmless; if we say the runaway effect is a 1.01^t multiplier, then a 2.02 degree increase isn't much harder than a 2 degree increase in terms of action. I don't know whether there's an expectation for the actual runaway effect for earth, but if you do know then absolutely school my ass if you find it before I do! I also like your point about the earth not needing saving: we do. One of my favourite comedians is George Carlin and he had a similar bit, with that patented Carlin vinegar! I agree wholeheartedly with that interpretation, but colloquially, you know what I mean. Still, some people might be too literal, so my being vague probably isn't doing anyone any favours. Regarding the end of your first reply [fifth point], I think the tie-in with not knowing what you mean by "predictions" is a sticking point for me; I don't think I can properly contest your point without a better understanding of what you meant. As for the lightbulb analogy, it was more a criticism for too-high standards for evidence; if it gets hotter the closer you get, then you should prepare yourself for a burning when you get too close. What it doesn't do is guide your actions after gaining that information - your burning your hand ought to tell you that lightbulbs can be hot, not that being burned means you can then break all the others in your house [I think that's a non-sequitur?]. But, it wasn't that great of an analogy to begin with, so let's just focus on the first part of this paragraph and leave the lightbulb where it was! Now we hop back into economics and how to guarantee work placement, timescales, and money raising. In short, there aren't correct answers here, just best guesses. Some people think universal basic income would be a game-changing, life-saving phenomenon, and others think it'l fall flat on its face. Both used the same framework to make predictions, it's a question of which effect would be stronger than the other. It's the balancing game that, I suspect, all economic policies have, which is pretty disconcerting if you think about it - the monetary system predicated on guesswork. Informed guesswork, granted, but guesswork all the same. I can't give you a working answer, just some ideas that have shown promise for others [Danish re-training for example]. If you're American, the money raising is strictly speaking not an issue; the USD is always in demand [since it's the international standard] which puts America in the unique position of being able to print money without [necessarily] causing inflation, due to their government's bonds still maintaining the same demand. For everyone else, it'd be case-by-case: Australia has a disproportionately high military budget [in my opinion], so some restructuring there could help. Alternatively, we have been quietly trying to figure out asteroid mining; if we succeed, then that could sort out any kind of funding for quite some time. I majored in economics at QUT, so this angle is a lot of fun to talk about! I also wasn't a good student, so Dunning-Krueger probably has it out for me...still fun though! Again, this'll have to have yet another reply. Please bear with me	UCHkuR2vwj-RfFyM033vZUSQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHkuR2vwj-RfFyM033vZUSQ	1	Ugzni2RFej0XzEXLt1d4AaABAg	boris daanimal

I'll finally be getting back to your replies; hopefully i can be as respectful towards you as you've been towards me. First thing's first: i'm glad we have some common ground and agreements! Not having any goodwill can shut down discussions as fast as they start, but it looks like that shouldn't be the case here. For the actual first point about worsening weather events, I will have to get back to you on that one. I was never sure ["sure" in italics...] that weather events were actually getting worse; you certainly here about them more often, and in the Australian case, there's a definite increase in events, but you're right to reason that these events could be spurious or have other causes. Apparently, firefighters causing arson is a known phenomenon, but even granting that firefighters just had a bad year, a hot and arid land for longer than it should be that way is, to my mind, a better explanation - fires start because the conditions to bring them about naturally have been at play for longer than they have been in the past. In short, it was overzealous of me to forthrightly claim that weather events are getting worse - I may feel strongly about that being the case, but I don't think I'll be reading any conclusive evidence on my gander. I'll also mention now that I'm glad we share the belief that man-made warming does [in some capacity] exist, since this can be a real sticking point with climate-deniers [to use your terminology] who are adamant in not conceding ground, like they think they're playing war when it's just an argument. I'll also admit my failing in recognizing you as a proper skeptic [still spelling it with a "k" because the red underline bugs me!]; 'youtube skeptics' have a somewhat toxic presence, and it was poor form for me to not at least give you the benefit of the doubt. Sorry about that. I'll be using your terminology, since it's accurate and all. That out of the way, I can start disagreeing with you again! Your point about predictions of scientists never coming to pass [crying wolf] doesn't seem reasonable to me. When I think of these scientists' predictions, what comes to my mind is their predictions of rise in sea level, glacial dissipation, and rise in global average temperature [before you respond, when I say global average temperature, I don't mean a global temperature. What I meant was the average temperature around the world, so Calcutta's temperature at some given date, Antarctica's temperature at the same date, and so on]. I'm not too familiar with the most pessimistic predictions, but I've never heard of anything drastic happening within a couple of years [or even a couple of decades for that matter]. Most often, I hear predictions for the end of the century, or the centuries to come. I don't know what predictions you've read, but I haven't heard of anything that could happen within so short a time frame that you could be disillusioned with its not coming to pass. I think this is an area where we need to be clearer with each-other in what we've seen and what we've read, so I'll add that to my reading list as well! So ends reply 1. See you in 10 minutes!

Proactive engagement is all well and good if it justified. Over what time scale? What would be changed? How will you guarantee work? How will you raise the money? How will you convince people that punitive measures are necessary? Fortification might be a more logical goal to achieve short term as the current targets are not achievable. China isn’t the greatest example as their economy is a boom or bust and superficially it looks great, however China are building coal plants like they’re going out of fashion, hundreds of them mostly abroad. Fusion reactors would be absolutely incredible and solve a huge number of problems, that’s the real golden goose there so I’m in 100% agreement with you. Sometimes I think the greenies would love to delete coal plants (rollercoaster tycoon is such a great game!). I’m wary of anything a government gets its claws into, I’m very much a free market person myself. Transition of skills sound good but I don’t think we can promise work for all those people who will lose their current positions. I have no problem with it if it’s done over a decent length of time but the current alarmist rhetoric and timescale would be devastating. Thanks for asking the questions, the following question is how do you know current levels of temp, sea, and CO2 levels are right? I mean from our point of view they are but for life in general? This gets onto the point I suppose I should’ve made in the first place and that is the arbitrary numbers game. 1.5c will be manageable but 2c will be horrific, we have 10, 8, 12, 100 years to do exactly abc otherwise xyz will happen. I hope we can agree that such things are not helpful as you highlighted with AOC’s claims which, let’s face it, are entirely political. If it’s a case of carbon in carbon out (carbon and carbon dioxide aren’t the same thing) then how can you guarantee that? How do you measure it? What do you do with the carbon dioxide you’ve sequestered? You still have to mine the materials for their creation, transport them to the site and from the forge. There’s a difference in saying what you (impersonal) want to do and actually doing it, that’s the crux of my point. If we can achieve all that as you say then absolutely let’s do it. The evidence for the bird deaths is usually laying around the bases of turbines. They don’t look like they’re moving fast but the very tips are rotating at hundreds of miles and hour so no they don’t see them. Besides it’s their lungs bursting in their chests rather than physically hitting the blades. I’ve seen the corpses with my own eyes so to me it’s not anecdotal. I just find it darkly amusing that the greenies would choose the most inefficient ethos of generating power when nuclear is staring them right in the face. The playing god part is more down to disaster born from good intentions. Yes we are now with power plants but more indirectly due to the slightly sticky situation we are in. Deliberately playing god with a system not entirely understood that has effects running well beyond the life times of those who commit them isn’t a great idea. The argument that playing god hasn’t worked so let’s play more god to try and fix it isn’t a good argument. The idea is to reduce our impact, not increase it because we think it’s right. I’ll also end in thanking you for providing a well thought out, forceful but constructive reply. Honestly I think if we met in a pub we’d have a far more progressive conversation about this than the politicians and activists have had in the last ten years, I think we agree on more than we disagree. We as a species have a phenomenal advantage in that we can converse thoughtfully and with reason, yet in this day and age it’s just this side verse that side when the reality is that we are all on the same side. As a sceptic I’m fully willing to be convinced, I’m not a diehard denier, but the recent actions of certain groups and people leave a bad taste in my mouth regarding their motivations. You haven’t convinced me either but that’s okay, I didn’t come out to convert you to my line of thinking I just wanted a discussion that’s very rare to have, I really appreciate it. We all say things in anger so I won’t hold that against you. Both sides are guilty of bad faith and that is used as reference for accusations of yet more bad faith and so it continues; it’s like jumping off the cliff and see who hits the bottom first. I’d rather knock their heads together personally. I’m confident that we can deal with any problems we will face, I just hope any action necessary isn’t done rashly as that will only cause more problems than it actually solves. Either way if you don’t reply I will you all the best.	UCkNHH3UTyZGSXgARCk4y8jw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkNHH3UTyZGSXgARCk4y8jw	1	Ugzni2RFej0XzEXLt1d4AaABAg	boris daanimal
Ugzni2RFej0XzEXLt1d4AaABAg.91jyzaN4-3591qJYre1RL9		0	2019-11-27 14:19:52	Rikky999	boris daanimal - thank you for taking the time to reply to me, I really appreciate it. The first paragraph I think we are in agreement on. As for the last part I was, perhaps needlessly, being flippant. I was trying to portray a satirical example of a diehard alarmist argument, I didn’t mean you shared that position. Sorry I should have been more clear on that. The second point. I’m not interested (in general sense) in a debate about whether climate change is real or the world is warming and we have part in that, that’s all self-evident and not a valid position to plant your flag, it’s what will happen and what can be done that interests and concerns me. There’s actually no real evidence that weather events are getting worse, I have the IPCC AR5 2018 report and it states there’s little or no evidence for the increase in cyclones, hurricanes, wild fires and floods. Of course that’s never mentioned in the media but then I’m just a cynic. This is rated as medium confidence because of insufficient evidence. The IPCC report is interesting because it doesn’t agree with the mass media alarmist position as much as the sceptic position. The third point regarding bushfires does have its caveats. It’s entirely possible that they may seem worse because they’re simply reported on more under the headline of climate change because people have become more sensitive to it. It’s also possible that bushfires are started deliberately, such as arson. Here in the uk we had some floods, now the floods could be caused by climate change (as reported) or its down to idiotic land management such as building houses on natural flood plains. I don’t know ultimately, I’m just exploring other options. I wasn’t trying to imply you don’t have a scientific attitude, I was talking more generally. I’m a layman like you trying to make sense of it all. To your second comment. I think we are in general agreement here. A sceptics position (spelt with a c not a k in the UK) concedes the fact that the world is warming by our hands. The question is how much and they have substantial data from satellite and some fifty million weather balloon measurements to back them, that’s data that shouldn’t be ignored. I suppose it’s a good point to mark my position on what makes a denier, sceptic and so on. A denier (I hate the term as it’s nasty, deliberately inflammatory and borderline anti-Semitic in my view) is someone who flat out refuses to acknowledge anything to do with it. A sceptic, which is the vast majority of us in some way or another, concedes and acknowledges that the world is warming by our hands but raises questions as to how much, how long, the affects of it, what solutions are needed if any or workable, etc. Then there’s the alarmist that buys it hook, line and sinker. They’re just as bad as the “denier” in my opinion. I have a serious issue with conflating scepticism with outright denial which is what the media does. I don’t like bloody names or titles for certain people, it’s unhelpful. My fourth point still stands as far as I’m concerned. We are told that this is exactly what’s going to happen over and over but it never does. So it’s not really what I consider evidence but what they consider as evidence and how that reflects on reality. It reminds me of the Aesop’s fable “the boy who cried wolf”. So far their claims have been inaccurate to put it mildly and scientists don’t have a crystal ball into the future. What we do have is evidence from the past and in many respects undermines their case. There’s also no such thing as global temperature just as there’s no such thing as global sea level. The consensus argument doesn’t hold as that has been debunked as far back as 2014. Science isn’t a consensus and it only takes one dissenting scientist to bring the whole thing down around their ears. That’s not to say a lot of scientists agree on it but that doesn’t imply consensus. I’ll concede your point about the ice age as I believe that to be the case. However the runaway greenhouse effect has been radically overblown. You’d need something like a 60c rise to trigger such an event, and the idea of feedbacks isn’t understood and fly in the face of physics as we understand them, especially when you take diminishing returns into consideration. The idea is that the more CO2 you pump into the atmosphere the less warming you’ll get, you can’t get a certain effect for infinity. Something like that, I’m sort of playing devils advocate with that one as I don’t fully understand it but it’s there to consider. I’ve heard that earth can become like Venus and it will... in a few billion years time. Venus has a much denser atmosphere, enough to crush steel, is closer to the sun and is extremely volcanically active. I think both sides are guilty of bad faith tactics and I think that’s caused by the injection of politics into what should be a purely scientific arena. Politicians and activists on both sides are using this to gain power and enact policies they want under the guise of “saving the world”. The world doesn’t need saving from us, we need saving from ourselves. The evidence for the earth warming and such is there as clear as day so I don’t really pay much heed to what “deniers” say. Fifth point. Is it though? Again their track record for prediction isn’t poor, it’s abysmal. If an engineer built a bridge and all others he built collapsed and he said “this one will definitely stand up this time!” would you cross that new bridge? A lot of scepticism is born from that record. Your analogy basically describes the scientific method, I tested it and it’s definitely hot, best not touch it again. Your opinion is simply being told it’s hot is enough to warrant destroying every lightbulb in your house. .

THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIX. it's just faulty logic though, i'm not going to hold it against you. closing remarks: thanks for taking the time out of your day to make a lengthy reply to me; i think the only ideas with merit are the ones that were challenged and made it out intact, so here's mine. being challenged. i appreciate it, honest. i think we have similar ideas for what we ought to be doing about this problem, but i'll freely admit, it frays my nerves faster than almost anything else - existential problems should be discussed with the utmost seriousness we're capable of, but it always feels like the 'opposition' is just acting in bad faith. i made my original comment out of anger, so i'm glad it got challenged. i don't think anything you've said changes my position though; discussion should still be about the most tenable solutions we can enact in the fastest possible fashion, not whether skeptics are satisfied enough to join that conversation. i feel that if we wait until they are, it'll be too late to make a difference, and the people responsible for that delay won't see the mess they've made - the mess that you and i will no doubt be left to clean up.

Now I do take umbrage with some of your points. The first is that the alarmists are also guilty of pushing their own myths, mostly fed through the lens of social and mainstream media. The favourite is the one you fell into that there’s a group of moustache twirling villains writhing around on heaps of money before they bathe in crude oil laced with the tears of polar bears. The second is that the right are doing this and therefore all thick bible bashers, again flat out wrong. The second is that because you believe that a predefined level of evidence backs your position therefore no one who disagrees should be heard on the subject. That is false position if you’re using the founding principle of science; science works on the assumption that it is wrong, not that it’s right. That’s not being scientific, that’s being dogmatic. If action needs to be taken then all voices must be heard and in that case all points are valid on a solution must be heard. It’s a bit like saying a murderer is not allowed a defence because he clearly did it, yet one is still supplied as he defence is valid, the same applies here, hearing only one side of the story isn’t the truth, it’s half the truth. Third is that, as far as I can see, the sceptics are the ones actively debating and talking about this whilst the alarmists are too busy bullying people, gluing themselves to lamp posts and generally holding nations to ransom. Again sceptics are applying the scientific method to this problem to find a solution rather than blindly panicking because “the experts says so!!! DENIER!!!!11”. The sceptics beg for alarmist to debate them but they won’t, and when they have they’ve failed to convince the audience. Fourth, there’s no evidence that we actually face any real threat from a warming world that requires such radical measures. We’ve had dire warnings before that have come to nothing. If they were so certain and knowledgable then they would’ve happened, clearly there’s more to learn and therefore debate. Fifth is that, while noble goals, there hasn’t been a single suggestion that is workable or achievable without causing huge disruption. What sceptics argue is that you’re willing to cause this disruption based on what might happen, compared to the disruption caused by punitive eco policy will have. A sceptics position may well be a reduction of carbon dioxide emissions will have next to no effect and money should be spent on fortifying ourselves against any negative consequences while we reduce over a longer period of time which would be more cost effective than completely overhauling the global economy. Six. This notion of the earth burning is outright hyperbole, it clearly isn’t. I will also add to my point three questions: What is the best climate for the earth? What is the optimum level of CO2 for the earth? What is the ideal sea level for the earth? It’s also very questionable, if not outright impossible, to live in a carbon dioxide neutral world, how will you smelt the steel, copper and other materials to create wind farms for example? Even then their favourite eco solutions aren’t exactly environmentally friendly. Again wind farms butcher birds and bats by the hundreds of thousands and forests have to be torn down so as to eliminate turbulence and provide clear passage for wind. “Even if our emissions are zero it doesn’t matter. The earth is still burning down as we need to do something about it” That rings alarm bells. Basically your argument is (if I understood it correctly) that if we are causing anthropogenic climate change we should stop it, but even if we are no longer causing it or - unlikely - not causing it and the world warms anyway, then we should cause man-made climate change to reduce it... we humans don’t have the best track record when it comes to playing god so I think leaving well alone might be the best course of action there. We should not under and circumstances deliberately and artificially alter something we do not understand nor know the consequences of that last or take place well beyond human experience. The very last part of your third paragraph I agree with apart from the renewable energy. It’s wasteful, expensive, and unreliable as it currently stand. The only reliable and green energy source we have is nuclear and that’s what we should be replacing our main source of power with. Reforesting is a great idea if done properly and we certainly shouldn’t be so wasteful. We need to clear up our act that is for sure. Your last paragraph doesn’t actually make any sense at all. If they are right they’re still wrong? We need blind action rather than grown up responsible debate? I for one am glad they’re actually taking their time with this rather than resorting to solutions based on panic and hysteria which inevitably lead to disaster, hint: extinction rebellion. Don’t get me wrong I generally agree with you on this, I’m a neutral party who looks at and contemplates both sides of the argument. Give me a scale between 1 and 10 ranging from flat out denial to doomsayer alarmist then I’m a 5 or 6. I just think we should be talking about solutions and what might be right and what might be wrong on both sides, there is merit in the sceptical argument and there’s truth to what they say. We must detach ourselves from the agenda-driven media, politicians and scientist of all strips and actually get to the bottom of this sea of misinformation because we are currently bobbing on the surface whilst the sharks are biting at our toes. Stonewalling each other is just plain stupid and unproductive.	UCkNHH3UTyZGSXgARCk4y8jw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkNHH3UTyZGSXgARCk4y8jw	1	Ugzni2RFej0XzEXLt1d4AaABAg	boris daanimal

What you&#39;re describing as the loss of temperature and end of the ice age is explained perfectly by the Milankovitch cycles, where the Earth&#39;s movement change over time which results in variation of solar radiation reaching the Earth. This hypothesis has been around for about a century now. Not sure why you claim scientists have no idea about this phenomenon.

The relationship only holds for planets where the surface pressure is above 10kPa. But I did find it interesting. We are due for an increase in CO2 following the Medieval Warm Period but the ice cores also show some often ignored points. The temps start to rise before the the CO2, therefore the CO2 did not initiate the warming. However the second point the records show is that the temps at their peak are dropping while the CO2 is still climbing. This demonstrates that CO2 increase is not sufficient to even maintain the higher temps, let alone cause increased warming. On variability, a .8% decrease in average annual cloud cover since 1850 is actually enough to explain all warming since that date. For CO2 theory to be correct, the centennial change in average annual cloud cover is required to be less than .4%. Highly unlikely considering the changes the Earth goes through. You are correct about impacts. Most people don't know there was a 175 kiloton explosion above the Bering Sea last year. These explosions are far more common than most people realise and a Tunguska, Chelyabinsk or Bering Sea event over any major city is the end of that city. Meanwhile they worry about plastic straws.

The thermal lag in Oceans is one confounding factor. All the AGW believers think that because we've been pumping out CO2 for 100 years that is the current cause of increased CO2 and temperature in the atmosphere now. For one thing the volume we produce is only about 3% of what is naturally produced annually. My hypothesis is practically all the CO2 increase in the last century (1 part per 10000) is due to degassing into the atmosphere out of the Oceans from the Medieval warming period which was around 800-1000 years ago. The Vostok Ice records and 3 papers based on it all show the CO2 following temperature changes by about 8-10 centuries due to this thermal lag, so this is the time to expect that we would be seeing increasing atmospheric CO2. Quantum mechanics shows that CO2 is a poor IR absorber and only does so in a couple of narrow bands in the thermal spectrum, in part overlaid by H20 absorption which is 20 times more potent. CO2 is a very limited and logarithmic-ally declining IR absorb-er. So not only does it have an extremely small green house effect in the first place, the more their is, the less effect it has due saturation. The paper you cited https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335927448_On_the_Apparent_Relationship_Between_Total_Solar_Irradiance_and_the_Atmospheric_Temperature_at_1_Bar_on_Three_Terrestrial-type_Bodies makes a compelling case that virtually all the atmospheric temperature is determined by the thermal gradient. He does not include Mars in the analysis but but that has at atmospheric composition of 95% CO2, and an average surface temperature of -60C. It rather contradicts the common perception that CO2 as a greenhouse gas has an effect on temperature. On temperature variability in short times, the alternate proxies show a far higher temperature variability that the Vostok ice cores, so it seems the climate history of the ice cores "smooth" both CO2 and temperature oscillations that have occurred on shorter timescales. I agree that the variability on short time scales likely has been far greater than is generally known, and that such swings are part of natural occurrences with little human contribution. We're are more likely to go extinct from a meteor strike than CO2 emissions, yet I don't see extinction rebellion protesting the lack of action on diverting meteors.

I'm rather interested in the short term rapid changes as I wonder if they might be behind some of the short term changes we see in the Holocene. For example the huge swings in Dansgaard–Oeschger events during the last glaciation. Why do people seem to assume that they stopped once we entered the Holocene? If they could cause multiple degree swings then, then perhaps they could be an unseen, underlying driver of change during the Holocene. BTW, you might find this paper interesting from 2017. I certainly did. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335927448_On_the_Apparent_Relationship_Between_Total_Solar_Irradiance_and_the_Atmospheric_Temperature_at_1_Bar_on_Three_Terrestrial-type_Bodies	UC9JHU3fM9XzrTKS70BJgb3w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9JHU3fM9XzrTKS70BJgb3w	1	Ugw2mx4-ndglpw-d-fF4AaABAg	soydjent

That could be simply being fooled by randomness. Having said that I agree that the cycles are a substantial component in temperature changes over time, http://www.climatedata.info/forcing/milankovitch-cycles/files/stacks-image-c5f4b30-800x546.png but there are other factors that are substantial and can override these larger cycles effects. Physics and paleoclimate history assert Milankovich cycles are a large factor in climate change, my point being that they are not the only driver or perfectly correlate. Other drivers and feedback interact and override those cycles at times. I disbelieve anyone who says there is only one driver of climate, and that based on that one driver there is a perfect correlation to temperature all the time. You are far more right in saying Milankovich cycles are a driver of climate though, than CO2 which has an insignificant effect.

This is not baseless, it is based on the geologic temperature record vs Milankovitch cycles http://www.climatedata.info/forcing/milankovitch-cycles/files/stacks-image-c5f4b30-800x546.png which show sometimes it does correlate, but sometimes it does not. Therefore there is not a perfect correlation. Also not baseless is my claim that solar radiance is an important factor in climate change. This paper by Soon, Connelly and Conelly convincingly demonstrates such a correlation https://globalwarmingsolved.com/data_files/SCC2015_preprint.pdf. I never said that humans have a greater influence over climate that solar activity, quite the opposite, I said that the scientific papers on the high side indicate a 1% influence. That leaves 99% to natural factors so I agree that human influence is minimal to negligible, and entirely overwhelmed by natural climate change factors. The release of energy into the oceans due to tectonic plate shifts are substantial, and due to time lag of oceanic heating logically could have effects that show up in climate centuries later. This is one of maybe 20 or so factors in climate change I could list as an example of factors not normally considered. The reality is climate is a complex non-linear system with multiple inter playing energy variables and its unlikely there will ever be a unified field theory of climate, nor will it ever be predictable on short time scales because of the complexity. One thing seems certain though, human released CO2 can be discounted as any sort of primary driver.

From 70s to 2000 we were warming rapidly. For 20 years now its been reasonably stable. My only point was short term rapid changes have little correlation to Milankovich cycles which are larger long term climate drivers. Within those cycles there are short term oscillations driven by other factors like solar radiance, el nina, cloud cover, tectonic energy releases etc. manmade co2 contribution is negligible in comparison to other factors. The weird thing it this relatively benign and pleasant period of mildly warm temperatures and stable climate beneficial for life on Earth is being called an apocalyptic emergency.

The evidence says the reverse is true, climate can change extremely rapidly. Consider a comparison between the mild warming since 1850 (a degree or so in 150 years) and the entry to and exit from the Younger Dryas period which saw changes of over 10 degrees in under 70 years. Granted the data was from the Greenland cores and we should expect to see some Arctic Amplification but the change is dramatic. Interestingly, the real push for the CO2 story started shortly after there were enough readings to demonstrate that climate was changing rapidly. The UHCN for example. Prior to worldwide data the prevailing wisdom in climate science was that natural forcings could only change planetary temps by .1-.2 degrees per century. Once the data was coming in, either the "Grand Old Men" of science were utterly wrong, OR there must be another factor at play. Guess which one they picked? Me, I've read far too much history and archaeology to think the planet is anywhere near as stable as is required for the CO2 theory to work.

They're a factor in climate cycles over a long period, but there are many climate factors at play, and interplay that cause shorter term climate change. Milankovitch cycles don't adequately correlate to climate cycles on their own.	UCRzKAdSjF0bYSHEWuU0WMhw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRzKAdSjF0bYSHEWuU0WMhw	1	Ugw2mx4-ndglpw-d-fF4AaABAg	soydjent

Note: total vegetation c02 contribution could be 748 billion tons, its a little hard to navigate the metric to imperial switch in some sources.<br />For starters while global warming was the initial term used, it simple nature leads to misunderstanding. The global climate is warming yes, but climate change is a more suitable term. Because its easier to be cognicent of what that means. Warmer means more energy in the system, more energy in the system means more powerful storms and other climatic events including those during winter because of the over all increase in global temperature.<br />So your explanation on the green house effect was a relatively decent simple explanation. Although due to the simplicity of it, there is room for confusion. As does your good yet overly simple explanation of the sources of c02. They are fantastic explanations for children, a little simplistic to promote informed discussion. For example those fossil fuels represent millions of years of carbon capture. Trees, plants, animals use carbon to build there bodies. Over millions of years geological processes condense this biological matter into what is essentially almost pure carbon. Using fossil fuels is releasing millions of years of stored carbon. To put this into perspective, from 1958 (316ppm) to now (415 ppm) c02 concentrations increase (773 billion tons of c02) is almost the equivalent to burning every ounce of vegetation on the planet (825 billion tons of c02). Remembering we haven&#39;t mentioned methane yet, which is a far more powerful greenhouse gas, much of which is locked in permafrost or the ocean floor. Even the rise over the last 60 years alone is just unheard of. The cretaceous thermal maximum which many deniers mention as it reached 1000 ppm took over 40 million years. There are also many conflating geological factors that would have contributed to the CTM mostly in regards to ice pack formation and continent arrangement. There does appear to be cyclic changes in climate but its the rate of the change that is the danger not necessarily the change in and of itself. The majority of confusion comes from the fact the majority of us are not effectually informed. Your beginning examples are case and point. They are brief informative summaries of the facts, roughly similar to what we all learn in highschool without actually taking classes in geography and climate. However they are not nearly detailed enough to make an informed decision on. To compound all of this methane locked in permafrost has the capacity to abruptly increase current warming. Current estimates suggest around 1.4 trillion tons of carbon in the arctic permafrost. As the permafrosts melt and they are, its effect on the rate of warming could be catastrophic and is usually what is referred too as the &quot;tipping point&quot;.<br />I totally disagree that climate scientists prefer eco chambers to discuss these topics, that behaviour flies in the face of what being a scientist means. It may appear as such due to the fact that short of evolution there are very few topics this many scientists agree on. I do however agree that media is hyper-inflating the situation and most super lefties are exacerbating the issue by prioritising ideology over logic. There is no real debate about the truth of human driven climate change. There is some debate about contributing factors and the level at which humans are responsible. Although its not on a range of between 2% and 60% its more a question are we the cause of 80% or 100% of global climate change. What essentially all agree on is that humanity is the major driver of climate change. <br />Finally while i&#39;m a lefty sitting somewhere near Bernie, ironically im considered a centre left in my country ahahah. I totally refute the majority of media based popular lefty opinion. Dumping all fossil fuel based systems and infrastructure would not only be stupid but economically disastrous. Many cry for the abandonment of fossil fuels yet very few have viable solutions to the problem. If the lefties could pull their heads in and the right could just a moment place wealth second, we may actually be able to solve the problem. Using the lefts vigour for change and the rights economically driven organisation we will fix it. For what its worth my opinion is nuclear power. Its clean, plentiful and you don&#39;t need to destroy huge swaths of the environment to build them. And its safe, yes when it goes wrong it really goes wrong. But can the fossil fuel industry claim they have only had 3 disasters in the last 50 years? Plus the diversion of resources from coal/oil and gas into nuclear energy will likely lead to huge innovation in design, efficiency and output.<br />I may have lost my thread there a little in the middle, call me out if i did and ill try to clarify my statement.<br />I know i should have listed my sources for these statements but this is youtube comment section lol. Everything i have said can be validated on google without any real difficulty, except the Carbon/ C02/ PPM conversions, i find the math an absolute cunt lol... But then i&#39;m a retard when it comes to math lol.	UCAIhswYmZRMNU77h3XfCxlQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAIhswYmZRMNU77h3XfCxlQ	0

But although he was able to produce a detailed enough model of the constituents of the atmosphere he obviously could not place it in the context of the characteristics of the solar system - even more unknown then than today. I think this is part of the problem. Scientists admire his brilliance and this has coloured their acceptance of his findings and methods. The solar system, as I say, is emerging not as a collection of objects but as a single organism-like entity with apparent built-in safety structures. Considering what the Earth has been through over the aeons and survived a piffling increase in atmospheric carbon is probably neither here nor there.

The good thing is they will be tested by events and, unlike the repeated warnings of the AGW brigade, it will not be possible to shift things along for a few more years if they just don't happen. One thing I am pretty sure of is that global temperature records are not being smashed, as you so confidently assert. How can you know this? Proxy data is notoriously difficult to interpret and there have only been reliable or semi-reliable recording stations in the US and Europe and a few other locations for a little over 100 years. Add to this the fact that AGW fanatics are constantly "adjusting' data that doesn't fit into the narrative and continue to ignore or underestimate the impact of the Urban Heat Island Effect then I'm afraid I must continue to be very suspicious of claims that global temperatures are increasing to any great degree, if at all. I still think it was warmer in 218BC when Hannibal crossed the Alps with an army of 30,000 including a troop of war elephants. It certainly must have been warmer in Greenland in 10th century when there were forests and fields of wheat and Viking settlers built towns and churches. I even think it was warmer in the 1930's when tens of thousands died of heatstroke both in the American Midwest and in continental Europe; hotter, and for longer periods. The very fact that AGW alarmists find it needful to suppress or minimise these long-established facts is proof enough to me that something sinister is afoot. You're either complicit in this con trick or a victim of it. I suspect the latter in your case.

Zharkova thinks so. Her team created a model that tries to predict solar activity, and suggests another solar minimum will occur from 2020 to 2055. The impact of a new Maunder minimum on climate has been studied many times. There’s 40% more CO2 in the air now than during the 17th century, and global temperature records are being smashed. A new Maunder minimum would slow climate change, but it is not enough to stop it.

For one thing it appears that they throw a blanket of extreme ultra violet around the upper atmosphere, something which probably has more affect on climate than cows farting in Argentina. A lady call Joanna Haigh provides a more restrained and intelligible view than Prof Zharkova. Go to http.//serious-science.org/solar-variation Something very interesting is that the two Voyager missions are now reaching the outer limits of the solar system after a journey of 42 years and it appears that we are surrounded by a skin of extreme heat. This layer appears to be undulated and the undulations appear to coincide with the 11 year cycles. It looks more and more as though the solar system is more than a collection of objects. It is a single organism-like structure with the sun as its nucleus.	UCFiIP0AINYJMoDwz2zfDmGA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFiIP0AINYJMoDwz2zfDmGA	1	UgyIhd4Zf07qvfaNAvx4AaABAg	Peter M. Eggers

Yes, she does get into some detail beyond the average person's comprehension. The effect of greenhouse gases is led by atmospheric H2O, as all other greenhouse gas effects would be trivial in comparison. The fact that it can phase change from a transparent gas to condensate making clouds at different atmospheric levels with different impacts due to reflectivity is beyond their ability to model at this time, way beyond. The H2O molecule also absorbs and reflects more bands of light, including infrared than does CO2, making it a much more effective greenhouse gas molecule than CO2. Then compare the relative abundance of each in the atmosphere: CO2 is 0.04%, whereas water vapor averages 0.4%, a tenfold increase, and its impact per molecule is much greater. The fact that water vapor varies so much by altitude and weather patterns minute by minute is a couple of reasons why climate predictions are beyond the scope of science well into the future. You might also want to check out Earth's Milankovitch Cycles which track Earth's ice ages very well, with variances due to very large tectonic/volcanic activity events, and of course the impact of very large meteorites also impacts climate for some time long enough to see it in the geological record.

Since the study was carried out using very extensive data obtained from weather balloons, rather than being yet another serving of Arrenhuis soup, it must be worthy of serious consideration. It is really the only empirical study of the atmosphere there is to my knowledge. The experiments are repeatable and the conclusions fit very neatly with the current situation: i.e. that global warming is nothing like as severe or chronic as it should be if the carbon increase theory is correct, and that proponents of the theory are fiddling data and lying through their teeth to make it appear that it is.

IVAR GIAEVER is currently a science advisor with American conservative and libertarian think tank The Heartland Institute. In the 1990s, the Heartland Institute worked with the tobacco company Philip Morris to question the science linking second-hand smoke to health risks, and lobbied against government public health reforms. The Heartland Institute has received $676,500 from ExxonMobil since 1998. Greenpeace also reports that Heartland received at least $55,000 from Koch Industries. Ivar Giaever has not published any work in the area of climate science. PATRICK MOORE has been a paid spokesman for a variety of polluting industries for more than 30 years, including the timber, mining, chemical and the aquaculture industries. Most of these industries hired Mr. Moore only after becoming the focus of a Greenpeace campaign to improve their environmental performance. Mr. Moore has now worked for polluters for far longer than he ever worked for Greenpeace. PATRICK MOORE frequently portrays himself as a founder or co-founder of Greenpeace, and many news outlets have repeated this characterization. Although Mr. Moore played a significant role in Greenpeace Canada for several years, he did not found Greenpeace. Phil Cotes, Irving Stowe, and Jim Bohlen founded Greenpeace in 1970. JOHN COLEMAN is an American television weatherman. He has not conducted any scientific research in the area of climate change. FREEMAN DYSON has ties to the Mercer Family Foundation whos tax returns since 2005 show some $22 million has gone to groups pushing climate science denial. Across the board, the groups funded by the Mercers have misrepresented climate science, promoted fossil fuels, denigrated renewable energy, and pushed to strip powers from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The Chicago-based Heartland Institute has received $4,988,000 from the Mercers. WILLIAM HAPPER. In December 2015, Happer was targeted in a sting operation by the environmental activist group Greenpeace. Posing as consultants for a Middle Eastern oil and gas company, they asked Happer to write a report touting the benefits of rising carbon emissions. Happer asked for the fee from this work to be donated to the "objective evidence" climate-change organization CO2 Coalition, which suggested that he contact the Donors Trust to keep the source of the funds secret as requested by Greenpeace. Happer further acknowledged that his report would probably not pass peer-review with a scientific journal. It goes on and on………………….

I've been thinking about creating a list of the best, most credible links, but short on time now. I put in quite a few hours to prove to a friend of mine that global warming was real a few years ago, and had to eat my words! I am amazed that the climate alarmists have been able to get away with this for so long. Though I don't have who the big investors are in scarce elements needed for windmills (i.e. neodymium) and batteries for solar arrays (lithium), and small country that has a significant source seems to suffering coups of leaders that aren't willing to give the multinationals control. As a bit of humor, you should checkout the fate of the Maldives as predicted by the climate "scientists" in 1989. Though the predictions were well publicized at the time, the Maldives fate is never mentioned. It also never ceases to amaze me that all of sea level rise hysteria never mention land movement up or down due to tectonic movement that all land on Earth experiences to some degree. Someone should be running around screaming that the sea is falling in Sweden! Actually, the land is rising, but tide gauges in Sweden are never used because it might get people wondering what direction the land is going at the beach. They would find some land rising, some land falling, and all at different rates due to tectonic movement. The increasing science illiteracy is quite disturbing to me, but the cultish behavior of the brainwashed masses is truly frightening!

However, global warming takes into account temperatures over the entire planet, including the oceans. The land area of the U.S. accounts for only 2% of Earth's total surface area. Despite the U.S. sweltering in 1934, that year was not especially hot over the rest of the planet. Globally, 1934 temperatures were actually cooler than average for the 20th century.

I wouldn't take Tony Heller's opinion that seriously either. I take the actual UNMODIFIED historical record as the best indicator of climate trends based on actual data and reports actually recorded in newspapers and science magazines as the best climate data available. You obviously have been fooled as I once was into believing that the published data, and the charts, graphs, and maps that is based on the published data is real. If you do a little digging, you will find that global climate data is very sparse across most of the globe, and completely nonexistent across vast regions of the globe. A tiny group of climate "scientists" take this inconsequential amount of historical data, estimate what they think the data would have been across most of the globe, filling in gaps not only in geography, but also gaps in weather station reporting, with supposedly their best guess. This tiny group of climate "scientists" then spend a few weeks to a few months adjusting the data in a process they call "homogenization" to create their "final" data that is the data that the rest of the world is given. The details of this process is secret, and all communications are carried out with encrypted email, lest the world discover what they have been up to for literally billions in funding and booming careers. A couple of years ago, I took a deep dive into climate science to prove to a friend that global warming was real. I had to eat my words, because I discovered the hoax. I am still amazed that they can get away with it.	UCLwn4MtV-1byknAU4oob8KQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLwn4MtV-1byknAU4oob8KQ	1	UgyIhd4Zf07qvfaNAvx4AaABAg	Peter M. Eggers

Look on utube, you will find 12 NASA scientists that debunk GCC from mankind alone. Look to IPCC ACTUAL data. Look at the united nations 31 models are saying about GCC. Only 1 is accurate, it says we are cooling. CO2 will only make it hotter and the earth more greener, there is a corbon laser professor at .... princeton? that chimes in on that. Watch suspicious observers and realize that these alterations to climate is largely stems from natural cycles. The earth is very susceptible to Sun cycles, asteroids, and other cosmic radiations/catastrophe cycles. All this is relative to the world not ending any time soon, but yes, we do influence the climate to a small degree, yet it will be getting colder in the near future, NOT due to humans. There is wide spread understanding about grand solar minimum happening soon, because of the drop in solar activity the last few years. The statistics have been largely manipulated, ESPECIALLY from the IPCC data, from just several years ago. Contact Ben Davis of suspicious observers on utube. See what the scientists used for manipulated data when they said &quot;90% of scientist believe GLOBAL WARMING is a fact&quot;. All of this is from scientists who do not have an agenda, except the truth. There have been extreme climate change in the last 100 years, your just not being told about it. Northern Maine, early 1900&#39;s they had snow in every month of the year. Think it was 1911? 1947, extreme cold snap in Wyoming. The California drought for 10 yrs, the 1930&#39;s dust bowl in the heart of the country for starters. This is nothing new, but the exposure is being dramatically increased in the last 30 years. and besides why would anyone EVER trust what Bush sr. says. Hes the guy that took us from a creditor nation to the beginning of being 20+ trillion in debt over the last 30years.

If you can&#39;t do that at least give me a small range. <br />After that give me impact of 100,000 metric tons of sulfur aerosols on the average global temperature (supposed to decrease the temperature). If you can&#39;t do that than at least give me a small range. <br />The whole issue is that scientists are not able to give you an honest answer to any of these questions. They can give you extreme ranges. But that&#39;s easy to do and often times those ranges are wrong. <br />So why can&#39;t they just use &quot;science&quot; to get this right? Well the largest issue is climatologists don&#39;t use the scientific method. It is physically impossible to use the scientific method when studying the global climate. One of the biggest reasons for that is that you can&#39;t create a control. There is no second Earth where we can test a hypothesis. <br />So if we are so unsure about this scientific guess, than why are we willing to put BILLIONS of lives at risk to solve a problem that we might not even be causing? <br />If the globe really is warming, what is the biggest risk? Rising sea levels is the biggest risk. <br />Denmark has suffered from rising sea levels, but they didn&#39;t solve the problem by eliminating all their fossil fuels. They did it through surge walls and floodgates. <br />Those things are expensive but they are far cheaper than getting rid of all your fossil fuels. <br />And in some cases it might be cheaper to just rebuild a city farther up a coast line.

With advanced technology, we are able to burn any type of fuel much cleaner than ever before. Also, just over 100 years ago, many people used wood burning fireplaces to heat their home and if a forest fire began anywhere, there was little if anything we could do to put it out. Most of the time it would just keep burning until it went out by itself, producing tons upon tons of CO2 in the process. Just think what would happen if man wasn&#39;t here to put them out.

We breath in Oxygen and exhale CO2. Vegetation takes in CO2 and converts it to Oxygen. So as a result of the increase in CO2, the earth is greener now than it has been since satellite imagery of earth began. As a result, the vegetation&#39;s absorption of CO2 will eventually outpace mans production of it. Which in turn will reduce the concentration of CO2 till such time as the vegetation begins to die off again. The earth has its own natural negative feedback loop that regulates things.

In the winter the glass allows the sun to be a heat source, while at the same time keeping the cold winter air out. The sunlight will be reflected back out through the glass as easily as it came in, but only after the plants and other objects have absorbed heat provided by the sun.

Not because the substance is blocking it, but because light is a wave. When light passes through water for example, the light wave interacts with the waves generated by the electrons orbiting the nucleus of the atoms in the water, thus counseling each other out, reducing the speed of the light. The density of water is great enough to have this effect, but since CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere are only 400 parts per billion, it would be impossible for the CO2 to effect the flow of light leaving the atmosphere. So the who greenhouse effect theory is hogwash.	UC4rA6ynZ98wW3SKqOz5TtDQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4rA6ynZ98wW3SKqOz5TtDQ	1	UgyIw79R0AjxbYLehR54AaABAg	Drew N

See Agenda 21 and Agenda 2030 to see how Cultural Marxism is being implemented top down and bottom up. The pincer attack.<br />P.S. Now that Pat explained the greenhouse effect, tell me why we are spraying our skies full of particulates like barium, silver oxide, and aluminum?<br />If you were desperately trying to fullfill the charge of anthropomorphic warming, would you try what they are doing?<br />So far, we can grow existing clouds, grow storms, kill storms, and focus snowfall. The effects of this manipulation seem to block rays more than trap them, for a slight cooling effect. When the numbers showed this, the warmists hedged bets and changed from global warming to climate change. When a larger handful of brave people showed how the warmists opted to &quot;hide the decline&quot; and bias the models to get the desired results, they said the debate was over.<br />And now their hysterical urgency is unmasking the tip of the biggest hoax since piltdown man.<br />All efforts lead to global governace.<br />That is their stated goal at &quot;The Club of Rome&quot; and the cooresponding actions against dissent show the importance of this dark plan for smashing freedom.

Ugwi_o8BhPcUoBhSr3h4AaABAg	1	3	2019-11-24 14:54:53	BeholderThe1st	Climate change isn&#39;t a dichotomy, even though politicians and activists are trying to sell it as such.<br /><br /><br />There are at least three parts to this problem:<br /><br /><br />1. Is climate change happening. If it is, is this even bad? (The media and activists focus on the negative, but there are recognized positives of warming for many parts of the earth.)<br />2. If climate change is happening, is it chiefly driven by man made sources. Even this isn&#39;t a dichotomy. It could be that humans are entirely to blame, partially to blame or not responsible at all. If humans aren&#39;t chiefly to blame, then this would inform the solution.<br />3. Assuming 1 and 2 are true, what is the solution. Activists and politicians all act as if the solution involves giving governments more power. This despite the fact that most activities we can affect will be meaningless unless you can bring the world&#39;s largest emiters on board. <br /><br /><br />Essentially, the &#39;pro climate change&#39; position is:<br /><br /><br />Climate change is real, it&#39;s all bad, it&#39;s caused by man, and the only solution is to give all power to government and end use of fossil fuels immediately. If you don&#39;t ascribe to this position, you are a Climate Denier. <br /><br /><br />This isn&#39;t science, it&#39;s faith.

Is the warming problematic?<br />4. Is there cause tot assume there will be a runaway effect?<br />5. Is CO2 a major contributor tot warming?<br />6. Does CO2 have other effects?<br />7. What effects if any will the proposed measures have on warming and CO2 levels? At what cost both monetary and to the environment?<br />8. Is adaptation likely to be a better strategy if there is a high level of uncertainty?<br />9.

However, it is undeniable that temperature increased in the 90s. The question is how much is man-made. Carbon dioxide increases have generally occurred after temperature increases throughout history. The question is how much this will lead to greater plant growth, humidity, clouds, and then cooling? China and India have become dramatically greener through trees, etc. and reduction of desserts over the last couple of decades. How does this compare to the Amazon and Indonesia deforestation which has reduced recently. <br /><br />I believe there is global warming but the problem is that the climate change models have always been wrong. Gore in 2002 was stating that 2020 would be a nightmare, 2010 predictions stated significant change by 2020. Yet the last 20 years have shown no major change. The question is what is natural and what is man made and what will be the real impact on the Earth?<br /><br />Until climate science starts being non-political and finds out what is really occurring humanity will not really do anything. However the watermelons are stopping progress.	UCmN1MKDaC8XzKrtr5MTlIng	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmN1MKDaC8XzKrtr5MTlIng	0

Like in climate change, the science of CO2, heat transfer is well established and there is little doubt that we are causing heating. The problem is how will we apply this to politics. Of course we all like to decrease effect of natural disasters, maximize arable land, water supply, increase wealth etc. So we need climate change models to predict various local phenomena and unfortunately this is the difficult part. Further the best way to lift people out poverty, increase wealth , health safety has been to industrialize, and the fastest and cheapest way is currently through carbon emissions. so right there you have another balance to consider, when does co2 emissions, on balance, become a negative factor in the general health and safety.

Regardless of the strength of anyone&#39;s argument for or against this issue (I like your presentation, very on point and knowledgeable) there are other factors that are influencing environmental change. There&#39;s increasing plastic waste in the oceans, the global fisheries are being depleted, the ocean is acidifying, forests world-wide are being cleared, mountains are being leveled for minerals, and species are being made extinct faster and faster through ecosystem collapse and habitat destruction. The WORLD is changing and man is causing it too rapidly for natural systems to accommodate these changes.	UC7eRgGMGa2JlkaYz8SeEwHw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7eRgGMGa2JlkaYz8SeEwHw	0

As interesting as it sounds and as well meaning as he might be, this is not about arguments. This is not a debate. It's about facts, some of which he is sadly not well informed... So, if we add the misinformation he presented, along with the way he presented the problem, we realize that we should probably listen to what research says, instead of this guy. He says so himself in the beginning of the video. The research is already out there. There is not one single conclusion you can put on TV. It's a massive amount of different studies and they are peer reviewed.	UCdW3MVsYWFNNdOJBEUhzw-A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdW3MVsYWFNNdOJBEUhzw-A	1	UgxTDoRAqfj8AMCCQ554AaABAg	rex cassidy

It&#39;s not as black and white as &quot;people who are currently making lots of money must be evil&quot; and &quot;the people who work for the other side must be good&quot;, because you&#39;re bound to have bad eggs on both sides.<br /><br />I certainly believe climate change is real, but I don&#39;t know how much of it is caused by humans and I don&#39;t know how much of what we&#39;re taught about it today is simple alarmism. I know for sure that we&#39;re not going to all die in 12 years, but I&#39;d love to see people put effort into keeping lots of forests around, whether it&#39;d be for the sake of the climate or for the sake of wildlife and keeping this planet looking pretty. And with how many types of technology have been invented in the past few years that actively work against climate change, why is everybody supporting policies and changes to the way we do things, yet nobody of that kind if supporting the use of technology that counteracts the issues at the same time?<br />Climate change is a monstrous topic, a topic nobody truly understands yet, and it&#39;s more important than ever that we get unbiased studies on it so we can actually figure out what the deal is. People still struggle to explain why there&#39;s been colder times before on Earth with far more CO2 in the atmosphere than we have today, there&#39;s info on that online, yet according to the figures everything should&#39;ve been on fire back with CO2 levels that high.<br /><br />I think what the people really want is the truth, and nothing but the truth. Some real results, some data everybody can understand, and most importantly, solutions that don&#39;t benefit anyone but the planet.

Surface temperature on Earth depends exclusively on a combination of atmospheric pressure, proximity to the sun and its behaviour at the time. This is the case with all planets in the solar system and there is no reason why Earth should be any different. The climate crisis scam is based on the errors of outdated science, seized upon by hedge-fund managers who make vast profits trading in carbon emission permissions, and welcomed by politicians as a means of taxation and control. C02 is a beneficial gas. Atmospheric carbon neither retains nor reflects heat as it does in earthbound enclosed experiments. Instead it absorbs infra red photons for about one third of a second before disseminating them in various directions. The directions are determined by the need to maintain the atmosphere in a state of thermodynamic stability, as Einstein posited in 1917 it has to be. There is no radiative force involved in temperature. The greenhouse has a built in thermostat.Carbon is a major component.

Long before atmospheric C02 levels reached their present levels Greenland was occupied by Vikings for some 300 years from 900AD They grew many crops and built churches and towns. They planted ash trees on graves which grew to such a size that the skeletons beneath were broken and twisted by their roots. Hannibal crossed the Alps in 218 BC with an army of 30,000 and a troop of war elephants. In the 14th century many of Europe's great rivers ran dry. In more recent times, records show heatwaves of far greater intensity and duration than those of the present day occurred during the 1930's and the late 1800's. Evidence for these facts, commonly accepted and backed by anecdotal and proxy data until very recently, is now being suppressed. Linking man-made carbon emissions to global warming is based on bad science, historical ignorance and a desire for financial gain and political ascendancy. The present level of global warming is entirely solar forced and in complete accord with long-established historical cycles.

UgwvvvpBPpb06vFAL3J4AaABAg	0	0	2019-11-24 09:01:06	Edward De Jong	I agree that a debate with prominent scientists and people with programming and engineering backgrounds would be great. I have seen Burt Rutan (the famous aircraft designer) lectures and he spends 4 hours going over the data. I think he is very persuasive that some of the leading scientists have tampered with the data, or exclude ranges of data that are not favorable to their conclusions. You can lie with statistics, and even the concept of a yearly temperature is a nonsensical idea. At 1000 points on earth the temperature is varying through the day and year, and wildly fluctuates, so an average temperature is not particularly meaningful, and we certainly don&#39;t have that accurate of measurements. In physics when you measure something you are supposed to draw error bars around your measurements indicating the range of precision. Another disturbing issue is that the computer modelers are not publishing their formulas, but hiding them inside hundreds of thousands of lines of code. These all-important formulas and parameters are tweaked not based on physics but to produce a specific outcome. That is fitting data to past measurements and is not actually modeling a physical system but &quot;steering with the rear view mirror&quot;.

To believe in climate change, the way they want you to, is to destroy the lives of everyone apart from the elites who are deliberately creating it.

Watching closely a pot filled with water heating up you can see turbulences building up, same applies I would suggest to atmospheric gases witch could explain the growing extreme weather and wind conditions occuring lately on many parts of the globe with katastrophic consequences. If such process is in fact going on and gets worse, I'd be inclined to prepare shelter.

On top of that I fear that the climatic changes are the effects that mankind caused 20 years ago. Hope that I am a complete lunatic and proven wrong in the future. Keep looking at selfinterests to make up your opinion and never panic as opinions do not govern physical events controlled by cosmic law! Cheers.

There are 2 terms &quot;climate change&quot; with 2 different definitions, but you continue to conflate them. Venice, Italy has been flooded before, over a century ago. Biggest Oil Rockefellers started the &quot;climate change&quot; hysteria half a century ago; playing both sides of the debate gives them the most control.<br /><br />And you&#39;re wrong about the Ice Age. We currently live in an Ice Age, and our current interglacial is <b><i>not</i></b> the warmest of the current Ice Age.<br /><br />Some of your statements were straw man arguments not made by anyone that I know of who truly understands the science or the history.

See: <a href="http://www.biocab.org/Geological_Timescale.jpg">http://www.biocab.org/Geological_Timescale.jpg</a> You will notice most of the last 600 million years also had more carbon dioxide than at present. And, you will also notice that temperature moves completely independently of carbon dioxide.<br />The real &quot;greenhouse gas&quot; is water vapour, it is not the trace gas carbon dioxide. Man&#39;s contribution to climate change is very small and limited to cities and farms, get a few miles away from those and man&#39;s contribution is zero. You cannot fix climate change because it is natural. At the global level, man&#39;s contribution is so small the signal gets lost in the noise.<br />If you really want earth to be greener, you want a lot more atmospheric carbon dioxide! NASA photos show the increase of carbon dioxide of the last 60 years has caused more plant growth. The other benefit of more atmospheric carbon dioxide is less water consumption. This is important because farmers are sucking all the water out of the water table to irrigate crops. There may be only 60 years of productive yield in many of the fields, but there is far less water than is required to irrigate. The water table does not recover as quickly as farmers are removing water.	UC-IR_w0BsspgvdeeGVxLAbw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-IR_w0BsspgvdeeGVxLAbw	0

Unfortunately, people today are more likely to believe information that agrees with their existing bias.<br /><br />The science is clear, human activity is slowly warning the planet. The natural cycles that create glacial periods occur on timescales of tens of thousands of years. Since 1950, man made carbon dioxide is responsible for more than half of observed warming.<br /><br /><br /><a href="https://skepticalscience.com/humans-caused-all-gw-since-1950.html">https://skepticalscience.com/humans-caused-all-gw-since-1950.html</a>	UC9WiYtyGg0JZrncMyHYgbmw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9WiYtyGg0JZrncMyHYgbmw	0

Because the person asking that, doesn&#39;t really mean that. What they typically mean is, &quot;do you believe that human beings burning fossil fuels are causing the Earth to warm at an alarming, uncontrollable rate, which is causing massive changes to the global climate, and that we are on track for catastrophic and disastrous outcomes within a very short time (10-20 years)?&quot;<br /><br />Because what happens when you answer the question &quot;Do you believe climate change is real?&quot; With a yes? Which virtually all climate scientists (and average people) do, by the way? Well, if you answer yes, that you do believe climate change is real, what is immediately assumed is that you also accept the full basket of assumptions that are built in that I listed above.<br /><br />Because people are not clearly defining terms. <br /><br />I could say a lot about this, and a lot about the things you talked about in the video, but if you really want someone to set your thinking straight on this, I urge you to invite Alex Epstein on to discuss it.

Universities are tied to the leftists in government who want climate change taxes. They distribute funds mainly to those who support their agenda. In fact, there has been a concerted movement to avoid, obliterate and ignore existing longitudinal data. By selecting only recent data points, the scientists can achieve the outcomes they wish to present. As far as the “settled science” argument, no science is ever settled, it’s always being challenged and adjusted. There is no “settled science”. But modern scientists tied to the university grants systems will tell you it’s conclusive and no further research needs to be done. By tying grant funding and tax revenues to the argument, the conclusions are corrupted before the data has a chance to be properly analyzed.

UgyA-O2Sfscp7opMlPZ4AaABAg	6	5	2019-11-23 13:31:02	ScorpionXII	This scientifically bankrupt video killed a few of my brain cells, so I&#39;m gonna try to redeem my brain by answer these “rebuttals” using real arguments. <br /> <br />“If it&#39;s mankind, what made it go away millions of years ago?” <br /> <br />Most of the time temperatures lower over time due to a process called chemical weathering, whereby carbon dioxide in the atmosphere forms carbonic acids which weather and form a sedimentary rock known as limbstone, thus lowering carbon dioxide levels, and reducing the thermal opacity of the atmosphere. An decrease in volcanic activity also leads to global warming due to a reduction in Sulfur Dioxide levels, which is a global cooling greenhouse gas. It&#39;s also important to know that the Mideval warming period and little ice age mentioned in this video are both the same event; the warming was caused by a decrease in volcanic activity, and the cooling caused by a later spike in volcanic activity. <br /> <br />“Satallites measuring antarctica showed losing land ice? It&#39;s a cycle!” <br /> <br />We don&#39;t use satellites to measure global land ice melt, and the only climate “cycles” on Earth are milankovitch cycles, which are dictated by the Earth&#39;s orbit, not carbon dioxide. The Earth&#39;s orbit is extremely stable and these temperature changes happen at about 0.04 degrees per 100 years, compared to the 1.7 degrees per 100 years we&#39;re experiencing currently. <br /> <br />“It&#39;s caused by mankind? It&#39;s always been changing!” <br /> <br />The issue is how fast the climate is changing, not that it is changing; roughly 40 times faster than natural milankovitch cycles. This is also a fallacy of a single cause because increased CO2 levels are not the only thing that can impact global temperatures. You may ask... how do we know CO2 is causing it then? Well... fossil fuels produce a unique carbon isotope signature which we can trace in the atmosphere; that is one of the ways we can measure human impact on the climate. <br /> <br />“Global warming will cause mass extinction? It&#39;s natural!” <br /> <br />I guess it&#39;s natural in the sense that humans are natural, and carbon dioxide is natural, but this doesn&#39;t effectively refute the notion that global warming will cause a mass extinction; in fact, there have been several temperature related mass extinctions in the past, and humans seem to be trying hard to be responsible for the next one. <br /> <br />“Al Gore had it right? He is a career politician!” <br /> <br />Whether Al Gore&#39;s claims are accurate or not is irrelevant ot the peer reviewed scientific literature. The 10,000s of peer reviewed scientific studies confirming global warming and climate change are demonstrable on their on merit, not Al Gore&#39;s merit. It&#39;s also poor chronology because man-made global warming was discovered 1896 by a Swedish scientists named Svante Arrhenius, it was later discovered that man-made global warming is causing climate change in the 1930s, since then we have compiled roughly 20,000 peer reviewed scientific studies from all scientific institutions across the world on this matter, it wasn&#39;t until the 1970s when Al Gore decided to make his shitty movie about it. <br /> <br />“Don&#39;t just watch CNN or just FOX, let&#39;s look at both arguments” <br /> <br />We don&#39;t look at either “arguments”, we look at the scientific literature; which concludes that human CO2 emmissions are causing global warming, and global warming is the cause of climate change. What American news networks claim is irrelevant; I will say however that FOX news on this subject is pure cancer. <br /> <br />“They say we only have 12 years to live” <br /> <br />The Earth is not ending in 12 years, the 12 year number comes from several peer reviewed scientific studies which found that we have roughly 12 years to reduce CO2 emissions by 50% in order to stop a runaway greenhouse effect. <br /> <br />“What percentages of this is caused by mankind; what percentage is caused by mother nature” <br /> <br />The carbon dioxide released by “mother nature” is apart of the Earth&#39;s carbon cycle, it&#39;s the access of CO2 emmissions which is causing climate change, 100% of which is from human activity. The only “debate” here is... how much of human CO2 is not being absorbed by the Earth&#39;s carbon cycle? About 70% according to the vast body of scientific literature on this topic. <br /><br /><br />Conclusion: You&#39;re very uninformed on this issue, and you&#39;re stick in a neutrality bias conundrum, the truth is... 100 years of peer reviewed scientific literature has the answers to all of the question you&#39;ve posed in this video.

Things beyond the Milankovitch cycle have been impacting global temperature since the start and a fair share has been caused by life itself. I'm glad you're alarmed by our current increase in global temperature because you'll probably flip when you discover how much the global temperature was raised during the Younger Dryas. Despite that massive increase in temperature we and life are still here and that in geological terms basically happened yesterday. We are producing greenhouse gasses that are far worse than Co2 and we know about them but no one seems to give a shit about those ones, I wonder why that might be if the bigger picture is genuinely trying to save the planet? and do you actually believe these scientific forecasts that to date have proven to be terribly inaccurate? I mean, woohoo they guessed correctly that temperature would increase but with an error margin of at least 100%! If anything that proves that science has no idea what is going on other than observing what has already happened. Then these scientists who are making these far-out predictions off incorrect models then try to tell us that "run-away greenhouse gas" is a thing? For every feed-forward part of the climate system, we find parts that feedback to regulate the system. If you could please be so kind perhaps you could direct me to this place where 12 years is proposed as some kind of tipping point? At the end of the day, I agree with where the alarmists are coming from in that we need to take better care of our planet but that doesn't mean that we need to become a bunch of irrational idiots. I'm not convinced that climate change is a good thing but the way that we are currently approaching this subject is not really appropriate, influenced by science and the decision making around it is culpable.

UgwbKPNwwJlN2UNS20F4AaABAg	4	0	2019-11-23 13:12:29	Ryan M	The greenhouse effect does not increase linearly with increases in atmospheric CO2. The effect is in fact partly self-limiting. CO2 absorbs and re-radiates infrared radiation from the Earth&#39;s surface, some of which returns to the surface. However, as the concentration of atmospheric CO2 increases, some of this energy is captured on its way back down and re-radiated again, this time back toward space. <br /><br />In other words, doubling CO2 does not double its greenhouse effect. As atmospheric CO2 increases, the per-molecule greenhouse effect declines in proportion. That&#39;s why when atmospheric CO2 was twenty times higher than today at 8000 ppm, average surface temperature was not twenty times higher at 1200°F. In fact, it was during this period that an explosion of life occurred on Earth. <br /><br />Atmospheric CO2 has increased to around 400 ppm since the industrial revolution. This increase is fantastically insignificant and amounts to almost zero enhancement of the greenhouse effect. That&#39;s why the planet&#39;s climate continues to fluctuate in such harmony with fluctuations in solar activity.

There is increasing evidence that the actual atmosphere does not behave in this way. Go to "A New Look at the Physics of the Earth's Atmosphere" at ronanconnollyscience.wordpress.com for interesting research promoting this point of view. In all probability the Earth's surface temperature is governed largely by a combination of proximity to the sun, its behaviour, and atmospheric pressure, as is the case with other planets in the solar system. Atmospheric carbon may purely be part of a regulatory mechanism evolved to maintain thermodynamic stability. The warming and cooling of the Earth seems to follow a fairly regular cyclic pattern. The current warming period is in accord with this pattern, beginning toward the mid 19th century and progressing through relatively minor peaks and troughs thereafter. We may expect temperatures to increase in a similar way for many decades yet before rapid cooling ensues. The sun's own cycles of activity clearly play a major part in all of this. How much effect made-made carbon emissions have is very much open to question, however.

Raise from 280 ppm to 400 ppm is almost 50% and increased global surface temps by more than a degree. Definitely not insignificant. "That's why the planet's climate continues to fluctuate in such harmony with fluctuations in solar activity." Solar activity has been constant / slightly declining for the past 60 years; on the other hand, most of the warming occurred in the last 60 years. Doesn't match at all.

No references in any scientific literature are Youtube-videoes. <br /><br />You have a couple of links to NASA&#39;s Climate Science site and <a href="http://scepticalscience.com/">Scepticalscience.com</a>, but you don&#39;t have one single actual scientific article on climate change among your sources. <br /><br />And this is why we should let scientists do science and decide what the science says, and not politicians, TV-interviewers or any other person outside the science. <br /><br />It&#39;s actually quite baffling because it&#39;s just a couple of weeks ago since 11,000 - eleven thousand (!) - scientists from all over the world signed a warning to the people of the Earth to take climate science seriously. <br />That comes on top of more than 12,000 peer-reviewed scientific articles relating to climate published between 1991 and 2014, which are all just saying one single and the same thing.<br /><br />So one has to start wonder: What does it actually take?? Does the planet really have to go to hell for people to take science seriously when it comes to climate?? <br /><br />Science-denial is a growing problem, and you are unfortunately not really contributing to fighting that with this video. Because of vaccine-denial is nasty germs like measles back to some extent - polio and several viral infections we thought we&#39;d eradicated. People have actually lost their children to measles after not vaccinating them because of vaccine-denial. Flat Earth... all this anti-science or pseudo-science is not doing anything good, and a person like you should really not be doing this - turning climate change into some show where you &quot;take a neutral stance looking at both sides&quot; like this. Doing that just shows a lack of understanding of science, which you really should be promoting if you talk about it. <br /><br />You should be as clear and unequivocal as the science and scientists are. <br /><br />And as such, you really don&#39;t need to talk to any scientists either, because all the peer-reviewed articles which constitute the actual &quot;science&quot; are out there and for the most part completely free to read for anyone. <br /><br />Here is what the one, unison voice of 11,000 - eleven thousand - scientists from all over the World says:<br /><a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/advance-article/doi/10.1093/biosci/biz088/5610806#">https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/advance-article/doi/10.1093/biosci/biz088/5610806#</a>	UC027Fw_QhBrejSgYE32Oc6g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC027Fw_QhBrejSgYE32Oc6g	0

Do you think you will run out of air or water in a enclose system. how much water and air on earth do you have compare to a car radiator. Now if big industry do not have a conform emission control system they make million in profit so they only need to buy one. people pay their own car emission control since many decades from their own pocket. also in the golf war they add set on fire 29 oil rig that burned for 6 month so where do you guess the 1 degree in 50 years comes from could that be a big part of that 1 degree change. those alarmist seams to play a game for the politicien to get more tax money from the people.

If I have a dental problem do I go see my mechanic? No, I go see a dentist. Why? Because I know that I have a much better chance of a decent outcome vis a vis my teeth with someone who has devoted their life to studying teeth rather than cars. Everyone has the right to their own opinion but you don&#39;t get the right to be taken seriously until you can back that opinion up with evidence. There is no country on earth that currently has an average life expectancy that is lower than the highest average life expectancy in 1800. No prizes for guessing why that is. Can you point to one single aspect of your existence that has not been influenced by science? Almost certainly the fact you are even alive is due to advancements in medical science. And yet the consensus of 98% of the world&#39;s climate scientists is not enough for you.	UC-cbkv8dn3vZ4pjGnERzA9Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-cbkv8dn3vZ4pjGnERzA9Q	0

You just proved my point so thank you for that. 12 years is the time before irreversible change occurs and is from a small amount of papers. It has nothing to do with when we are going to die- you just showed your own ignorance - well done. There's no irony because paranoia is not at all necessary for following scientific method. However, healthy skepticism is. This involves first being educated in what you're skeptic of. In science that means studying the field to the same or higher level than those which you are trying to disprove. Rarely are discoveries made by completely dismissing current understanding. Usually its small changes in understanding as new technologies emerge and combine. Sometimes there's a big discovery by some lowly undergrad but usually they are at least first familiar with what they are disproving. False predictions are often exaggerated thanks to the media. Sensationalism and science are unfortunately linked throughout history. As many deniers like to point out- previous models were shit, so of course they were wrong. Models are constantly improving and we have to run with the best we can. Unfortunately results from current models look pretty bad for us. I hope future models prove it to be wrong, but I will err on side of caution till then and i'd advise everybody to do the same.

"Climate scientists" are mental dwarves, strutting in puddles of their own conceit. They have no apparent understanding of the vastness of time, nor any awareness of the incomprehensible forces of gravity, magnetism and plasma waves which suffuse our little corner of the universe. Burning coal? Farting cows? Laughable irrelevancies in the great scheme of things. The sun is a great deal more than the visible yellow thing we see in the sky. Jupiter and Saturn, as distant as they are, extend their influence throughout the solar system. The climate of the earth is totally dependent upon a combination of these factors, balanced by atmospheric pressure. The earth's atmosphere is, and must, tend towards thermodynamic stability, as posited by Einstein as long ago as 1917. If it were otherwise our planet would have become as inimical to organic life as Venus and Mars long, long ago. The petty increase in atmospheric carbon created by the burning of fossil fuels will be readily absorbed in a system which has evolved to maintain this stability. Atmospheric carbon disseminates infra-red photons. It neither retains nor inevitably reflects them back to the earth's surface. The greenhouse effect is a total misnomer. It's not glass up there. It's a thermostat. Enjoy your crayons.	UCFiIP0AINYJMoDwz2zfDmGA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFiIP0AINYJMoDwz2zfDmGA	1	UgyrSguZT_xT3cNOGZN4AaABAg	joseph mclennan

In Europe certainly, in China probably and over the whole planet almost certainly, there was a quite rapid rise in temperatures beginning in both in the 4th century and in the 10th century, followed in both instances by equally dramatic drops in temperature after periods of about 400 years. We have only anecdotal evidence and proxy data for these occurrences of course but both are quite compelling. "Peer review" has become a quite meaningless term of late incidentally If you train a generation of scientists to follow particular procedures and then ask their fellow students to judge how well they have been indoctrinated it proves very little.

Fake data taken from heat islands skews recent temp data to higher levels giving the fake hockey stick.<br />CO2 is an irrelevant and insignificant greenhouse gas................water vapor is a much more dominant greenhouse gas by orders of magnitude. On a clear night after sunset with no wind and with low humidity, the temperature will drop due to radiational cooling. CO2 does not capture enough heat to stop the temperature from dropping. However, if clouds form, the temperature will rise proving the dominance of water vapor.

Carbon doesn't have any ability to trap heat under any circumstances" This was proven wrong over 100 years ago. "4. Carbon is 0.04% of Earth's atmosphere" ... so? CFCs are only a fraction of that and destroy the ozone layer.

UgxSugfHrEkGHOvRSRZ4AaABAg	1	0	2019-11-22 20:39:25	pafnucek	The question of how much percent of climate change is man made and what is caused by nature is a very DUMB ONE. The climate physics don&#39;t work like accounting, because of tipping point. The danger is that human contributions to CO2 and other greenhouse gasses emissions will trigger the tipping points, where massive amount of CO2 and Methane is released from soil, arctic sea floor and permafrost. To say that human contribution to climate change can be estimated in terms of % is like saying: We can tell how much of a death is caused by a blood loss due to bullet hitting your artery, and how much of death is actually caused by natural things like your heart pumping blood. Having said that. The facts are that humans cause ALL of the current global mean temperature increase! ALL of it. Volcanoes, soil, and natural cycles emitting CO2 are irrelevant, because we know - from isotope marking of CO2 - that CARBON FLUX is in balance or slightly negative. We know that NET CARBON GAIN due to burning fossil fuels alone (not including deforestation etc.) is 33%. How? Again. It was measured by checking carbon isotopes ratios in the atmosphere. The proportion from burned organic stuff can be distinguished from natural carbon. How we know its 33% net gain? For the last 800,000 years - check Vostock ice core CO2/proxy warming record - the atmospheric CO2 was around 280 ppm. It was actually fluctuating beetwen 250 - during Ice age periods - and 300 ppm during integlacial periods. So the average for the last 800,000 years, when we account for glaciation cycles, is around 280 ppm. Currently we are at 415 ppm. Which means we added around 1/3 of extra carbon and we add around 2.5 ppm every year.<br />Although we are due for the next Ice Age in about 100,000 years - not soon - the current interglacial period - THE HOLOCENE INTERGLACIAL MAXIMUM - peaked at 0.5 C lower than its now around 8000 years ago and since than had a slight DOWNWARD TREND. We started going slowly into the next Ice Age. Now, despite SOLAR IRRADIANCE OUTPUT declining last century, we passed the Holocene maximum again and the hockey stick is completely caused by human activity. Despite environment absorbing HALF of CO2 produced by humans, we still somehow managed to be on track of doubling atmospheric CO2 by 2120,<br /><br /><br />Bottom line is: man made climate change is an established fact. There are NO TWO SIDES OF THE DEBATE. Educate yourself people instead of making a false impression that there is a debate and both sides are on equal footing. Deniers have not facts on their side, virtually all science is in agreement about what happens to the climate. Just because most people don&#39;t understand climate science, it DOES NOT justify voting and bargaining with percentages. You can&#39;t sway physics to obey your point of view. Facts are facts. Listen to people who know what they are talking about. You don go around and argue with what doctors know or claim you know better how to engineer the phone you use. If you think you do, disconnect your internet and try to cure your cancer with orange juice. After all you know better and will haggle with laws of nature to make your beliefs true.<br /><br /><a href="https://skepticalscience.com/heading-into-new-little-ice-age-intermediate.htm">https://skepticalscience.com/heading-into-new-little-ice-age-intermediate.htm</a><br /><a href="https://skepticalscience.com/human-co2-smaller-than-natural-emissions-intermediate.htm">https://skepticalscience.com/human-co2-smaller-than-natural-emissions-intermediate.htm</a><br /><a href="http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/files/1999/11/Figure3-1.png">http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/files/1999/11/Figure3-1.png</a><br /><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_climatic_optimum#/media/File:Holocene_Temperature_Variations.png">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_climatic_optimum#/media/File:Holocene_Temperature_Variations.png</a>	UCuubbTUT1tYENB9eRLGnOng	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuubbTUT1tYENB9eRLGnOng	0

Do people seriously think a business wouldn&#39;t care about the future? If the world was really going to end do to fossil fuels then they would absolutely change things since money is useless in a world that&#39;s dead. The same thing applies when people claim businesses don&#39;t care about people making money/the middle class. It&#39;s in their best interests to have an economy where people have money to spend. If 99% of the population is poor/has no income then who&#39;s going to buy the products and services. Most of the wealth is with the 99% but they just can&#39;t see it.

Climate changes due to mankind&#39;s usage of fossil fuels: a hypothesis that people, including scientists, either support or dispute. That is known as anthropogenic climate change. Supporters of anthropogenic climate change claim that mankind warms Earth faster that it should occur naturally. The opposition claims that is not true. If you are not sure whom to &quot;believe&quot;, you are in luck because we already have decades of research and research-based predictions. You don&#39;t even need to understand basic science to check who got their predictions correctly with 5% error. Saying &quot;it is warmer/colder than predicted&quot; is not correct answer. Saying &quot;sea level is lower/higher that predicted&quot; is still not correct answer. Saying &quot;there is consensus&quot; is not correct answer to anything as existence of firm, indisputable evidence doesn&#39;t require scientific consensus. Have fun!

UgxTJbIEkWeXD2KQych4AaABAg	0	0	2019-11-22 19:11:18	Williex Merritt	Is man-made climate change real? It most certainly is! To consider that question let’s look at some facts. Over 30 years ago the US admitted it had Weather Modification Technology when it became a signatory on the UN Treaty in 1976 BANNING the use of Weather Weapons against other signatory countries. (See the link below!) The UN does not sign treaties based on conspiracy theories. 1976 was over 30 years ago. So it’s easy to conclude that the Weather Modification Weapons (WMW) technology has advanced since then. (In fact, they have moved from ground based WMW to space based WMW.) <br /><br /><br />SO - since it is a FACT that governments have the technology to modify and control the weather that raises the real question: Why aren&#39;t they using their Weather Modification technology to STOP bad weather and save lives and property? <br /><br /><br />The Pink Elephant in the equation is the fact that the treaty does NOT ban the use of Weather Modification Weapons against one&#39;s own country. Hmm... (Think Chemtrails). <br /><br />Now let’s do some math. There was a document entitled UN Agenda 21 (2021). The Green New Deal was introduced in 2018 by AOC. 2018 + 12 years (until the &quot;end of the world&quot;) = 2030. Hmm... what a coincidence that UN Agenda 21 got renamed to UN Agenda 30. Go research the contents of UN Agenda 30. <br /><br />Weather Modification Weapons can just as easily be called Climate Change Weapons! Create a Problem and then offer a solution: UN Agenda 30. Ta-Da! Was that the plan all along? Perhaps that’s why Bill Gates recently &quot;suggested&quot; that we use Geo-Engineering technology (i.e. the same Weather Modification Technology banned by the UN over 30 years ago) to fight climate change. Hmm…. <br />These elites really think we&#39;re stupid. Had HUMANITY LOVING people been controlling this Climate Change technology they would have used it to help humanity by now. Let that sink in. <br /><br />There are some mind expanding videos on youtube by the History Chanel that explain how weather weapons work and why the UN had to ban them. Just search on “History Channel Weather Warfare”. <br /> <br />PS - They never thought she would lose. <br /><br /><a href="https://2009-2017.state.gov/t/isn/4783.htm">https://2009-2017.state.gov/t/isn/4783.htm</a>	UCzwfCM1N4W9tl3sTpnG6eRw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzwfCM1N4W9tl3sTpnG6eRw	0

There is nothing to worry about. If it was a simple as what they&#39;re saying then every person in the world just has to plant one tree. And the problem is fixed. <br />But that does not even need to happen because the Earth is already doing that herself. The Earth is getting greener by itself. Duh. Humans can adapt to whatever comes. It&#39;s not a big deal.<br /> The world is not going to end.

And it also makes it easier for colleges and scientist to get funding for it because it is so broad of a title. <br />They just have to say we need money to study climate change. See how easy that was. Very simple and apparently non controversial sounding. <br /><br />But identity politics and climate change are the only real weapons that the socialists have to keep the money pouring in. Scientists should be ashamed of themselves causing such a ruckus over nothing. <br />The world is not going to end because of climate change. <br />The world is not going to end because of a meteor hit.<br />The world is not going to end because of a gamma ray burst, or a black hole, or a rogue star.,etc.<br /><br />There was only one thing that was taught for well over 2000 years consistently. Wait for it......<br />The second coming of Jesus Christ. That is when the end shall come. The Bible is very clear on that. Bible prophecy is very clear on that. <br />Yes I understand people want to ignore religion but it can&#39;t be ignored. The Bible has been right on every point of prophecy. There is no reason not to believe the little prophecy that&#39;s left for the future. <br /><br />Climate change and identity politics are all about raking in the money. Scaring corporations like Chick-fil-A into donating to them.<br /><br />Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s kind of strange that oil companies donate to the study of climate change when that is actually contrary to their business model?<br /><br />Do your own research. Every time the LBGTQ+ mob comes and scares a corporation or politician the money soon follows. It&#39;s the same with climate change and and any other left-wing group. <br />It&#39;s all about the money. Keeping the money flowing. <br />That is why these groups will always have something to complain about even after some things have apparently been fixed and a lot rather unnecessary. <br /><br />Wake up people. Wake up America. True freedom is under the hammer.	UCz6mhA20gSgLa44DYBG8zOA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz6mhA20gSgLa44DYBG8zOA	0

It was a reply session. I already stated my stance. There is nothing for me to prove. If a salesman comes to my house selling acme vacuums doesn't mean I like, want or am interested in them just because he sells them. I have been around for 50 years and know Global Warming renamed Climate Change is nothing. It is a waste of tax payer money and a means to force Socialism and more government control down our throats. No thanks. I also believe in the Scriptures as well. Which have been proven to be true and just. And I also know that government control is inevitable. Either way human kind is not going to save the world. Especially on a planetary scale. That is pretty arrogant in itself to even think. Unbelieving scientists and individuals are the ones who have elevated themselves to gods not I. I like this guy asking for people to sit down and have a discussion about climate change but that is like asking them to sit down and talk about foolish things. If anything was agreed upon the conclusion would still be foolish. Scientists still only focus on the status quo paradigm. The Bible is left out completely. If a global flood happened which there is a heap of evidence to back that up that may explain a lot of things we see and the temperature fluctuations. Earth originally warm moderate climate. Rain, flood, meteor, volcanic cotastrophy happens. Flood waters start to recede. Layers of sentimentary material deposited and plates shift (maybe not in that order). Earth loses heat and oceans still warm. Ice Age happens or occurs as a result. In early post flood there is a lot of water still left in many areas on surface. Earth dries over time on the surface. More deserts grow. More water back to ocean. Earth seeks to go back to equalibrium and Earth overall starts to warm up in cycles. But no secular scientists will investigate a model like that or similar. And you don't even have to acknowledge before Adam and Eve. Long ages don't need to apply when catastrophes happen. Results are quick,abrupt and destructive. And we know it doesn't take long ages for most things to happen. Fossils,oil, canyons, etc. Just need the right circumstances. Is that what you wanted me to hear? Climate change is still a non issue. Humans can adapt quite well when major changes occur. A greater concern of mine for people is most don't even know how to grow a tomato or sanitize water if a natural disaster came. That is a much greater problem then the Climate Change Doomsday fake event.

Now we are in a cold period and how long it will last is anyone&#39;s guess. Ice grows when its cold and the sea shrinks and takes on Co2 when it does.<br />Venice floods because part of it sank 14cm, after they drained the underground Aquifer.<br />The IPCC is part of the UN&#39;s climate scam.<br />The Sun sends us rays that cause clouds to appear, which makes it cold or wet. Currently the Sun is on low power and when that is the case the Jetstream wanders and can give us alternating extreme weather at either end of the day. 1 degree over fifty years during a warm period, whats the hassle with that. Lose two degrees and then get worried as more die in the cold.<br />Co2 is a trace gas and as such can&#39;t make much of a difference to anything.<br />Any Green deal is a scam, lots of money has gone in but nothing has changed bar the energy bills are flattening the poor across the western world.<br />Then we hear the UN say their Climate policy is nothing to do with the Climate, it&#39;s all about keeping the poor, poor with taxation. The EU spends its time sucking the wealth out of its member nations, hoping in time they will feel so poor they are too afraid to leave.<br />The debate is finished, the Science is settled according to the alarmists, but all their predictions have failed miserably.<br />Currently to add to Ireland&#39;s woes, the wandering Jetstream and the low sunspot period has meant they have only harvested 30% of their potato crop. Much of Northern USA has suffered the same but mainly due to the onset of an early winter and snow. Also in the same countries grain and soft fruit harvest are down and all to do with the Sun.

To the layman it seems that really NONE of the disasters have actually occurred thusfar, especially with regard to sea levels. To make matters worse hysterical journalistic claims (starving polar bears, disappearing glaciers etc etc) are regularly debunked. The "science" is more and more beginning to look like intellectual conceit. I suppose if you spend years and years learning stuff and being tested on it and getting better jobs the more stuff you can repeat, then the pressure to believe the theories you have been taught must be pretty immense. Prediction is dangerous - especially in the case of AGW when there are clear political and financial motives for placing a premium on carbon emissions.

Ugwis9DvBau33QePEY94AaABAg	3	0	2019-11-22 15:35:55	Andrew Mckay	Climate change is only small not as they are putting it all over the media. The earth is about four billion years old and has always gone through stages of cooling down and heating up. Co2 is the gas of life. We breath it out, plants and treas breath it in then release oxygen, without one and another trees etc would not exit and neither would we. The oceans cover most of the planet and release co2 as well. The more the better, it does not warm the planet as much as we are being told. They called it global warming originally but had to change it to climate change when they realised the average temperatures were slightly going down. They lie to us and try and brain wash us through the media etc etc for reasons to suit them. Their aim is for global control and profit from introducing green tax on systems etc saying they will cool the planet, but it will be going in their pockets and other things, not cooling the planet. Problem, action solution. Create the man made climate change lie, when man has almost nothing to do with it, wait for the reaction, protests etc, which is exactly what they want, then hey presto, offer the solution. New tax regimes. If they didn’t create the lie, and just try and implement the new tax regimes, a lot of those climate protesters today would be out protesting against the new tax regimes. Fact. The scientists that agree with them are government funded through universities etc so their hands are tied and they can’t speak freely and have to go along with the governments. The scientists who are independent whose hands are not tied will tell you the same as me but in much more details. They try to shut them up in various ways and even ban them from publishing their own facts in some cases. People need to look the proper facts up and realise what’s going on. The main cause for global cooling or warming is down to decreased or increased solar activity on the surface of the sun. The solar rays from increased sun spot activity break through the earths atmosphere and warm the oceans slightly. Also the moon is affected which effects the tides, and it effects the jet steam moving it slightly up or down, which’s effects the weather one way or another above it it and below it. I will say this though. I am all for the local environment issues. Car exhaust fumes etc which effect people with bronchitis etc and skin problems. The waste plastic in our oceans needs to be addressed too and other issues. Check out piers corbyn for climate facts. He is an independent scientist as well as many others. Co2 does not create warming, it follows it. Also when the temperature goes down it then follows that too, but there is a 4 to 8 hundred year lag before it starts to follow it due to the slower temperature changes in the oceans. Most of the planet is ocean and the warmer they are the more co2 they emit. The charts originally showed that lag too with the spikes in temperature and co2 being 4 to 8 hundred years apart but they falsified the charts and put both the spikes together to make it look like co2 was to blame to suit their own agenda as explained above. If they were so worried about man made co2 then why do they not do something about termites which create a lot more co2 than we do ?. Out of the whole atmosphere only about 0.4 percent of it is co2, and only about 4 percent of that 0.4 percent is man made. Also think about this one. Why are developers investing in building all around the world on coast lines if they think in about 20 years time they will be flooded? Also why are the banks investing money to those developers to help them build, and providing long term mortgages to people to buy those properties etc on the coast lines? The answer to that is they know damn well that man made climate change is a hoax. I will mention again, check out piers corbyn and others, independent scientists, not government funded, hands not tied and can speak freely without the risk of loosing their livelihood. Again think about this. Out of the whole of the earths atmosphere, only about 0.4 percent of it is co2. From that, only 4 percent of that 0.4 percent is co2 that is man made. ( That’s not even a fart in the wind ). Thank you for reading this.	UCbHNpBcwr2TfLCS4Cki9fkQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbHNpBcwr2TfLCS4Cki9fkQ	0

The elite own the banks, have a strong influence within world governments and are creating man made climate change hoax for their own agenda. It is changing but not through man. They blow things all out of proportion and put it all over the media. Push it through schools and universities etc. It’s a form of brain washing which sadly is working in their favor which you can see with climate protesters, most of which will not have a clue about science. They just hear something on the tv and believe it. Thankfully more and more people are starting to realise what is really going on. It will just create even more divide between rich and poor as it is the working class which will suffer through more and more taxes.

By all means, write your own! Don't confuse condensation with an insistence on rigourous thinking - like most people, I object to folks with zero experience coming and telling me how to do my job. We don't do that with dentists, doctors or construction workers - why scientists? Everyone has an opinion these days; it doesn't mean they're good ones. And, since you missed the memo, Wikipedia is the most accurate document ever created by mankind. Its not perfect, by any means, but presents an accessible and (usually) well referenced place to start an inquiry. You should be ashamed of yourself for suggesting otherwise.

But even that is a joke of a problem.In my mind the biggest problem is not what can we do to stop it (because my side says thats natural and the other thats by humans and we have 12 years) But we should raise the question - What the fuck can we do to negate the side effects so that some billions humans will not die. When i and my colleagues are in truth than ... we are fuck up't for the simple reason that we never invested in the right agrarian technology and in retention tanks and so on and so on.When the second side is right we are doomed for the simple reason that we have 12 years and the only possible way to reduce carbon emission is to kill a far billions of humans because wind energy and solar panels are ineffective and to the truth create more polution per kilowat than coal plants and because of that they never invested in the right agrarian technology and in retention tanks and so on and so on.The climat change science (or climat cooling science or ozon hole yada yada yada is as a department of science one of the youngest when not THE youngest department at this moment and we need a haleluya more data to understand what the heck is going on)	UCaW0risIFwfH07OoCDdgNyw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaW0risIFwfH07OoCDdgNyw	1	UgwTcPBXNcC8Y5dPl_p4AaABAg	LBS mam

Note I said climate change, humans are not the primary cause of climate. I don't know if you deny many other scientific conclusions and such, so considering you a denialist or a conspiracy theorist is quite unfair until the knowledge of your views on other aspects of science and history is ascertained. However, saying that you haven't been wrong shows that you did not read my full comment. Literally, the second part of my comment was where you were wrong in regards to your interpretation of the source you gave in another comment. Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research's focus is not improving the accuracy of our measurements for solar irradiance, but instead understanding the source which causes changes in this measurement. I agree that certain, more vocal groups of the community over exaggerate and raise a sense of panic, and whereas the concern may not be as critical or on the time limit they proclaim, the evidence supports that it is an important issue to be discussed and that action is needed to reduce or prevent long-lasting damage to our biosphere. The thing about exclusively reading the source papers for research is that these papers are not designed to be digestible for your standard person. The primary audience for those academic papers are the other people in the same field who can question and test the conclusions determined in the paper. They are not written in a way that is easily interpretable. Media has a problem with this all the time, where one source will take a paper, misinterprets the data and comes to a false conclusion. However, it is also said that many times media is used to take these complex papers, then reorganize and restate the true conclusions in a format that is digestible by your everyday person. So don't get me wrong its a good thing you read primary sources, but don't always conclude your interpretation is correct. Nor should you completely ignore mainstream media, but look at their conclusions with skepticism and see if the scientists who obtained the data they made their conclusions about agree with them.

If this was a debate on stage, it would be one thing as remembering a list of where you obtained information can be difficult. However, this is not on stage and you can find the exact paper you read in regards to your interpretation. It might not be required for you to give sources, but it is common decency especially when you are constantly asking Allen for scientific sources. If I was Allen whenever you asked for a source to his information or a scientific paper, I would have hit you with the same things you would say to him. Every fact he brings forth is easily verifiable, given the field of reference. After all, intellectual adults have this amazing ability to fact check and educate themselves, right? So find it yourself. 2. I haven't looked into the atmospheric chemistry you mentioned but guess who looked at helioseismology. In fact, I found a source I know you should be content with, since you provided the source in a reply to another comment thread.(Not sure why you didn't include it in this thread.) https://www.mps.mpg.de/phd/solarphysics-irradiation-sun-climate . Regarding this source you said “Interestingly, the chart was my point. Which calls for new methods of measurement to further our understanding of solar influence. We know it has a major impact.... what we don't know is the full extent. The inaccuracies in current anthropogenic models don't help.” I have read this source that you provided and you seem to have a misunderstanding in what they are trying to improve the reliability of. The source has no mention that our measuring methods are inaccurate, and specifically states that climate followed trends in solar activity up until 1970, at which point the line diverges, showing that another cause is having a significant impact on climate change. The reliability they are wanting to increase is the reliability of a model, and thus the reliability of accurate predictions. As your source claims, “The main aim of the PhD projects in this field is to gain better understanding of SOURCES of the variability of the solar brightness and the photospheric magnetic field and to reconstruct them over as long periods in the past as possible” The problem is not the measurements of the effects of the sun on climate, but an understanding of the source of variability in solar activity. Think of it like this, I can use a thermometer to obtain a decently accurate reading of the temperature in my house. However, if I wanted to create a model which predicts temperature variation in my house, I need to understand the sources of the changes in temperature, not necessarily the specific value it currently is. This would include things like the rate of transfer of heat between the inside and outside via walls, windows, etc. It requires an understanding of air currents within my house which impact heat distribution. A whole plethora of information is needed in order to make an accurate model because it’s a complex system, which is hard to predict. Since I personally don’t have a good model for this phenomenon, my predictive capability is lacking for things like how much I will spend on electric which is heavily based on the temperature changes due to the heat kicking in. In this example, climate is the electric bill, and fluctuations in that bill is climate change. Solar activity are the temperature changes which I have trouble predicting. However, the actual measured values of temperature are accurate. If I found my electric bill consistently escalating whilst temperature changes are not, then we have to conclude that maybe its not the temperature changes causing the escalation. Let’s take this a bit farther, I found another source which tells us that we have only been measuring solar irradiance for 4 decades. https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018EGUGA..20.9136W/abstract . I hope Harvard is good enough for you, although it’s only the abstract. Many of the people who worked on this are from the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research, the group who your source is attributed. Now this makes sense for the graph depicted in the first source. Up until 1970’s, aka around 40 years ago, the reconstructed irradiance shows a large amount of variation and reconstruction as we were using non-direct measurements. After direct measurement became a thing, we now see the line as solid with very little variation or reconstruction. So, we are extremely confident that the information in the last 40 years are accurate representations of solar irradiance. Guess what, in your source’s graphic, it is CLEAR that solar irradiance is not the drive for sudden increase in temperature due to the last 40 years recordings not matching up with that temperature increase. Using your source, it is safe to say that solar activity(at least irradiance), whilst no one would argue that it has no impact on climate, the current radical changes in our climate are not due Solar Activity. Now something I will agree on you with is that our early predictions of climate change were not accurate. This is why we need a better model that has a better understanding of why solar activity changes, so our predictions can be more accurate. 3. As I said previously, the fact that he can't disprove you has less to do with the truthfulness of Allen's claims or his intelligence but instead with how well he can communicate and debate. PS. As far as me questioning your intelligence and education was concerned this was not my intent. I, possibly falsely assumed that your career in the logging industry was the manual labor part of the work. In the U.S. at least, this job does not need climate knowledge at all, and is more reliant on a person's hard work than their intelligence or schooling. However, if you are a geological engineer, or other job within the company their is a chance that climate knowledge is necessary. It is also to be said that just because a person is not in a field that requires certain knowledge, they can still obtain said information. Why I brought up this point is that, if we assume Allen is being truthful in his career, it is ESSENTIAL that he has knowledge of climatology, whereas with you it could go either way. So from my perspective we have a doctor making a claim about how the heart works and another individual (you) on the other side who is not in a medical field claiming something different. Of course the doctor could be wrong, and the other person could be right in their claims. However, I would naturally be more inclined to believe the doctor and would need both individuals to provide sources as to why they believe their claims.

Although Allen is clearly very emotional about the subject. With this being the case he attempts to move away from his bias by instead using scientific articles, studies, and papers with links to sources. In a typical debate format, people don't typically have access to data and any data brought up in the debate is free to be scrutinized after the fact. In science, conclusions are drawn from the interpretations of data using the previously established scientific knowledge. The most logical conclusion is not determined by the most well-argued reason, but instead the conclusion which is most supported by evidence. Now debate wise, as I said before, I think JP is a better debater... however, he provides literally 0 sources to the data in regards to his conclusions, his "well this is what meteorology , helioseismology, etc. but does not provide a single source where a scientist from said respective field says anything." Now on the other side, we have Allen who has provided a plethora of sources, even if we only include primary sources. Much of what JP does is straw-manning. For example, JP brings up that solar activity is the primary drive of climate and thus climate change. Now if changes solar activity strongly correlated with the data on how the climate is changing, he would have a solid argument. Unfortunately for him, no data was given. Now as Allen is not a good debater in my opinion, he says "prove to me that solar activity is driving climate" However, his wording is very poor. What Allen is trying to ask for is evidence that VARIATIONS in solar activity are the primary cause for VARIATIONS in climate. Now, of course, JP takes this and runs away with it saying that you have to have a sun to have climate. This information is something that Allen knows as per his followup but due to his poor wording, he was straw manned into attempting to argue for something he did not even say. By the time he realizes what JP is doing, the damage to him in the debate is already done. JP looks more intelligent because he argued against an absurd claim not made by Allen. Along with this. JP brings nothing to the table and thus nothing to refute. So we have JP on one side debating against an argument Allen does not make, making claims without support, disregarding any evidence brought by Allen by claiming inadequacy of his sources. ( A little side not here, I know why Allen is using Wikipedia as much of the information on the website is accurate and understandable by your average person, however, it is not a scholarly source so I think he should just leave news articles and wiki out of it since they will just be denied.) On Allen's side we have someone who is not well versed in debate and thus easily falls into traps, who has scholarly data against the claims of JP, and whom understands the conclusions drawn by the experts who obtained and reviewed the data but is bad at communicating said conclusions. You say that Allen's credentials aren't important however we are looking at someone (who claims) they are working on a PhD in forest ecology. This is a branch of science hugely based on both the biology and environmental aspects of a forest. These environmental aspects are in large reliant on climate, and how changes in the climate affect the environment. Although there are even more closely related fields to climate change scientifically speaking, understanding of climate scientifically is still essential. Now we have a logger on the other hand, where knowledge of climate is not taught and frankly not used. I see this Dunning Kreuger effect happen all the time on a variety of scholarly subjects. This logger thinks he understands climate better than scientists whose jobs are reliant on understanding climate, creationists think they understand evolution better than biologists, proponents of alternative medicine think they understand medical science and anatomy better than doctors, etc. Its not everything, sure, but it does give his arguments WAY more credibility especially when outside sources to other scientists are provided. By the way, Jordan Peterson, where he is intelligent and someone I would hands down lose a debate with, still has many problems with regards to the truth of his interpretations. I don't particularly remember which debate it was in, but Jordan Peterson was using quantum physics as a crux to his argument. Now neither debater was a quantum physicist and thus the other guy couldn't determine if Peterson was using quantum physics properly. After the debate, it was found out that in fact, quantum physicists did NOT think that quantum physics could be applied for Jordan's reason. Thusly, everything after which relied on a false premise has no justification. If a premise is wrong, any conclusion reliant on the premise can not be determined as reliable unless other reasons, not reliant on said premise are given. Sure, expertise isn't everything but it is nowhere near irrelevant. I disagree with you in that JP is more well rounded in intelligence. I believe JP is better at presenting opinions, whereas Allen is more knowledgeable of the information and conclusions made by scientists but bad at communicating his opinions and scientific conclusions.

Wikipedia is great for you because you seem intelligent but don't understand the basics of the thihngs you're talking about. Take as one example your idea of "CO2 only holding heat for 3 seconds, then spewing it in all directions". Yes, that's true. Its also the whole point - where do you think that heat goes? This is exactly what is heating the planet. This is basic physics which you would learn in any first-year physics class (as well as common sense).

This is a little complex and worthy of discussion, but we know a lot about how the world works, and can certainly investigate hypotheticals and make projections. Assuming the future will be like the past is obviously problematic. A pithy example - by that logic, just because I haven't died yet means I'll live forever. Obviously silly, but only because we know something about the mechanisms of how the world works. The consensus of most of us is that current climate models are not alarmist enough - we have consistently ignored positive feedbacks in the climate system, for example, simply because they are 'hard' to understand'.

No reputable journal supports denialist points of view. This can be easily shown by simply browsing them. You misunderstand - my point was that I could not do your job better than you, and if I thought otherwise after a week on youtube and blog sites I'd be full of crap. I was pointing out scientists' frustration with others doing exactly this; thinking they can do our job better than us, usually people with no experience in science and no experience evaluating scientific papers, data, etc. People who say we have 'no consensus', 'we do bad work', we're 'in the governments/ ENGOs/whatever' pockets. We are humans who've dedicated our lives to truth, often at considerable personal and financial cost. We should be listened to. I regularly attend CSEE for example (Canadian society for ecology and evolution), which is Canada's largest gathering of biologists, ecologists, etc. Out of thousands of attendees, literally zero take climate denial seriously. In fact, we often talk about the disinformation that's out there, and lament the fact that nobody listens to us. I'd be happy to debunk particular arguments, but this is not a good forum for that type of thing.

Part of my research is determining what we should plant where - the forestry industry is in big trouble here in BC, and climate change is a big contributor to that problem. One of the questions that my colleagues are answering is 'what types of trees should we plant when we cut them down?'. Should we plant trees that do well in the climate today, or the climate as we expect it to be in 50 years when those trees hit adulthood? This requires a realistic assessment of climate change. Those assessments are solid and based on best evidence and models available. This is just one example where using science to do real things is important. Not doing so is foolish in the extreme. Those journals you refer to.... don't exist. And if they do, they are fringe in the extreme. Over my 15 year career, I have not met a single scientist who gives any credence to the arguments commonly peddled online. I don't know what you do for a living, but imagine I came on to your job site after a week of reading about things online and watching YouTube and argued that you have it all wrong and I could do your job better than you. This is the frustration that many scientists feel about this stuff.	UChAe-8ort1H-ea7VCS8OXCQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UChAe-8ort1H-ea7VCS8OXCQ	1	UgwTcPBXNcC8Y5dPl_p4AaABAg	LBS mam

There's nothing weak about the CO2 absorbing infrared argument, its pretty straight forward high school chemistry/physics. I'm happy to go into depth on that one but I don't want to give the impression i'm answering the wrong thing. Of course water vapour is a stronger greenhouse gas but that doesn't mean CO2 has no effect. Why do you talk about heat dissipation like its purely a local effect? The scale in which the Sun heats the Earth and the Earth radiates the heat away is anything but local? The composition of the atmosphere plays a huge role in this and is by definition not local at all. You're greasing up the goal posts here.

Where is the proof of what you are saying? If they were so localized why is it that we find evidence of non-naturally occuring CO2 isotopes in ice core samples no where near local industry? Show me evidence, i'll wait. CO2 has been shown to absorb infrared radiation. The same kind that is emitted by Earth during a process known as radiative cooling. The heat obviously gets out eventually, but it spends longer in the atmosphere due to CO2 getting in the way, thus shifting the equilibrium and leading to increase in temperature. I hope that makes sense.	UCKtMXDDKMcwc_edo4UpGTRw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKtMXDDKMcwc_edo4UpGTRw	1	UgwTcPBXNcC8Y5dPl_p4AaABAg	LBS mam

The reason the adjustments in the US data has had such a large effect is due to a US wide trend towards taking measurement earlier in the day, before daily temperatures reach their maximum, as was the systemic method of data collection in earlier times. Also the skeptics like to point out that the US has not warmed since the 1930's, this is true - but only because, in picking the 1930's as their reference point, the skeptics are cherry-picking an exceptionally warm period in the US contiguous states climate history - the dust-bowl era, the US is now returning to the temperatures experienced at that time.

All of the plans proposed to fix it are way too expensive, the economic costs outweigh the actual affects it has on the environment, and polar ice caps have increasing from a decade ago. So where is the death of humanity? No where near in sight. So why should we change the way we live? Climate models fail all the time because they haven't stood the test of time. Any climatologist would tell you this. Multiple have failed in the past. I'm not taking a non-intellectual approach to it.

When CO2 is labeled a pollutant, and the government needs to regulate it, then all of life will need to be controlled by the government. Governmental control of life is the true goal. Carbon dioxide, considered the main vector for human-caused global warming, is some 0.04% of the atmosphere by volume, or some 400 parts per million (ppm) [1]. Water vapor varies from 0% to 4% by volume [2], and so should easily average above 1% [3] near the Earth’s surface, where the greenhouse effect would be most important, and is about three times more effective [4] a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. So, water vapor is some 25 times more prevalent and three times more effective; that makes it some 75 times more important to the greenhouse effect than carbon dioxide [5]. The TOTAL contribution of carbon dioxide to the greenhouse effect is therefore 0.013 or less.

"Carbon dioxide, considered the main vector for human-caused global warming, is some 0.04% of the atmosphere by volume, or some 400 parts per million (ppm)" yes, so what? "near the Earth’s surface, where the greenhouse effect would be most important, and is about three times more effective [4] a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. " so what? water vapor content of the air is dependent on the temperature of the air, and thus cant cause a trend. it collapses aevery night. unlike CO2. " The TOTAL contribution of carbon dioxide to the greenhouse effect is therefore 0.013 or less.

When plants began to flower and thrive, carbon dioxide was 4-6 time greater than it is today. Plants need carbon dioxide to flourish.<br /><br />2) Find any significant number proponents of climate change, especially the most visible, and look at how they live their lives. They live in large if not multiple mansions, along water fronts supposedly as most risk of climate change impact, fly on private jets, etc. Even the scientist promote large face to face gatherings of “experts” to discuss climate change, which promotes dangerous jet &amp; car travel, which is supposedly a dangerous cause of climate change. No climate change proponents have ever said we need to begin now evacuating and relocating people along the coasts, stop any economic investment along the coast areas. Even NASA, supposedly a proponent of climate change has its bases of operation at coastal areas. Why aren’t these people and organizations living up to their own claims of imminent danger?

You can’t even see the need to truly evaluate your very statement. You own words reveal a need to dig deeper into what is being promoted. A gas so essential to life we must reduce it....this is where common sense and skepticism rise up to reveal holes in logic. At a minimum, a reasonable person would read your own words and say “Wait a minute! If CO2 is essential to life, do we really want to make drastic efforts to limit it? Especially when the geological record shows 4-6x the amount of atmospheric CO2 was beneficial to plant life and we want to consume it. And we are promoting a transition to a plant based diet, but want to limit the key gas that would support increase plant life...” At its core, such a common sense take would cause any scientist to pause and say.....we need to know more before we recommend wholesale economic, lifestyle, and governmental changes. There just might be a circular consequence here...you know...promote the reduction of the key gas that increases plant life, our desired food source we want to become more reliant on, but find ourselves with our food by limiting the gas that promote its growth... And all that was said without profanity, etc.	UCTAWlXlvq5Y5BHmW5onAdGA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTAWlXlvq5Y5BHmW5onAdGA	1	UgwTCYb2V2-tpTZhHS54AaABAg	Sean You Know Who

I completely understand the need to launch a rocket from an equatorial location and it isn’t about safety, it is about managing rocket fuel to get to orbit. Launching from a position further from the equator requires more and more rocket fuel. NASA should at least be taking measure to protect, elevate, etc, such locations from the doom...unless it doesn’t exist. Again, you resort to rants and no common sense.

First, your again cherry pick the Obama mansion issue as though it is the only point. You once again avoid the real issue, which isn’t a red herring. If climate change is coming, then coastal areas development should be heavily scrutinized and an ex-President living along the coast among other climate change proponents doesn’t demonstrate such concerns. As for Obama and others living on islands and coastal areas, the claim isn’t just about flooding the property. It would also be about the cost to create and/or maintain infrastructure (roads, gas lines, electrical lines, cell towers, etc) that would be destroyed by such pending climate doom. This would create an unnecessary burden on governments, financial industry, etc to reinvest and rebuild an area where a known disaster is permanently going to impact the area. Not to mention, the supposed incredible loss of life this would be expected to occur. In addition, there would be environmental concerns as well if such infrastructure is damaged and exposed. This is why we have flood plane analysis for real estate development, to avoid costly rebuilding, reinvestment, environmental, and loss of life impacts. Why waste all such resources in developing and maintaining an area that won’t be habitable in 12 or even 50 years? Spend the resources elsewhere. So you miss the entire debate over coastal property being developed which anyone with common sense clearly would see. As for scientist riding bikes to symposiums, while a very few may have done so (and again is cherry picking) no the vast majority can’t do that when most come from long distances. Hard to ride one across an ocean. Second, it isn’t only scientist that demonstrations and symposiums bring, it is also media which also fly or drive in as well. If the issue is so dire, have an internet based symposium where NO TRAVEL is required or encouraged? Once again, no facts, just ranting. And yes commons sense does work in this debate. It easily surfaces weak arguments and shows where obvious solutions would mitigate such climate change concerns. I will give you another hint on this issue and how it doesn’t truly fly..... If there truly was a concern over climate change and impacts to coastal areas, then you would limit development of such real estate for people to live and/or support such populations with food, etc. This would be a clear argument for controlling immigration into your country. With ever shrinking resources for humans population all caused by the coming climate apocalypse, governments would only be responsible by controlling immigration into their country. But.....you don’t hear this common sense impact of the climate change argument.

You are deflecting the conversation away from valid points that question the validity and credibility of those who promote climate change is a problem. In fact, you are relying on a common tactics, which is the binary perspective of you either accept climate change (good) is true or you are a denier (very bad). You can’t accept anything in between. You then lump this into the “You don’t need to discuss facts” since deniers don’t accept facts, which is always a convenient position when data, methodologies, and facts are highly debated and they are in this matter. More importantly, those who espouse climate change, both inside and outside the scientific community, do not live their lives in anyway that shows they truly believe in their own ideas. This alone brings a high amount of skepticism to any establishment study or report on the matter. Also, realize skepticism is NOT denying anything.

When CO2, the building block of life needs to be regulated as a pollutant, everything alive, and what they do, can be controlled. Climate Change caused by man is just an excuse to implement a one world government and a new world order. Under Agenda 21 (now Agenda 2030), the rights of the whole are more important than the rights of the individual. Agenda 21 (now Agenda 2030) will have Kings and the serfs who serve them. If serfs are needed, at all, in the computer age of robotics and cyber reality. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NStwnOh9AsU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NStwnOh9AsU</a>	UCws8bL7Yto-VtCrGuKR4YWg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCws8bL7Yto-VtCrGuKR4YWg	0

Especially FOX. For example: When the media says that scientists say something like &quot;coffee causes cancer&quot; one day then &quot;coffee is beneficial&quot; the next. It is not scientists talking here, it is the media sensationalising various hypothesis. A scientist may say &quot;we have found a link or correlation between people who drink coffee and the prevalence of certain tumours&quot; the media then say &quot;scientist say coffee causes cancer&quot;. Instead accredited (not PragerU bs lol) peer reviewed science is where you need to look for accurate information, studies, and analysis. <br />Crikey there is so much to write about concerning this vid. Instead I&#39;ll just add a couple of questions. If you need your teeth fixed who do you go to, a dentist or a mechanic? If you need your radiator fixed who do you go to, a mechanic or a dentist? Climate scientists are the experts in this field and they overwhelmingly say humans are increasing the rate of change and increasing the average temperatures. You will not find a single peer reviewed study saying humans have no effect. You may ask by how much? Well in this vid we can already see without all the various factors such as Sun, Mantel, and Atmosphere the planet would be close to 0 kelvin. Considering we are around 300 kelvin due to the Sun, mantel, and atmosphere; a 1 to 4 degree rise caused by us is very very small 0.01%. But consider this also; all the big ice ages occur over thousands and thousands of years. The difference in temperature between the last major Ice age and today was around 4 to 5 degrees. But because the change was slow animals and plants had time to adapt. We are going to change the planet by 4 degrees within 100 years (roughly). NO time to adapt. This is the problem. <br />Sorry this is such a complicated topic and trying to explain this in such a short time with so few words in simple terms. SO I ask one question for everyone: Does anyone think pumping 20 billion tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere every year does nothing?

Ugxdjmtey90v90jExRh4AaABAg	6	0	2019-11-22 11:54:27	Bitch D	Climate change is real. There should be no arguments for that. The real debate should be 1.) is the climate change we are experiencing a natural cause or is it significantly altered by human activities, and 2.) is sacrificing the economy worth the harm we cause to the climate and environment.<br /><br />A lot of people from both sides make INCREDIBLY stupid argument. Arguing against climate change is arguing against science, but there are some people really exaggerating the effects of climate change. No, we won&#39;t die in hundreds of years, but just because the predicted effects of climate change didn&#39;t happen doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t happening. It&#39;s explained in high school geology classes that major changes to the earth (such as a 1% increase in average global temperature or plate movements) can take decades, centuries, or even millenniums, so it&#39;s stupid to assume that we would die within a few decades. HOWEVER, that also means that it takes a LOT of money to clean the earth, so we can&#39;t always sacrifice the environment for money because it&#39;s going to cost more in the long run.<br /><br />What I said barely even scratches both sides of the argument for climate change. It&#39;s not as simple as &quot;stop using fossil fuels&quot; or &quot;we have to sacrifice the environment for the economy&quot; as both sides stupidly keep bringing up.

The effects we are experiencing now (such as a >1°C increase in average global temperature since the start of the last century, sea levels rising, coral bleaching, etc.) aren't really predicted.

There is concrete evidence that climate change is a fact. Scientists are the only ones people should be listening to, not politicians who say things just to gain popularity. If you don&#39;t believe the science you may as well believe the earth is 3000 years old like the Bible says. Regardless, why are people trying to deny the fact of climate change and refusing to help save our planet, with things such as mass deforestation or major plastic pollution killing wildlife what sort of soul-less person are you to be okay with all that happening just to keep the greedy bastards of this world happy.

The funny thing is, BOTH sides of the climate change accuse the other of adhering to PSEUDOSCIENCE rather than SCIENCE. First, allow me to say that I do support the idea of being responsible tenants of our beautiful planet Earth. Having said that, let me commence to dismantling for you the whole Global Warming PSYOP/MISO. <br /><br /><br /><br />Karl Popper famously said, &quot;A theory that explains everything, explains nothing.&quot; Meaning, if the theory purports to explain everything - it&#39;s irrefutable - that irrefutability is actually a WEAKNESS, not a STRENGTH of that theory because instead of science, it&#39;s probably dogma or ideology, not a fact that could empirically be measured. For example: Global Warming: the onus to prove it to be accurate should fall on those who support the catastrophic anthropogenic climate change that what they are saying is accurate. Every prediction they have ever made has been proven FALSE. Let me repeat that - EVERY PREDICTION ESPOUSED BY THE PROPONENTS OF CATASTROPHIC ANTHROPOGENIC CLIMATE CHANGE HAS BEEN WRONG. What metric would you use before you concede that you COULD be wrong? The irrefutability of the claims reveals it to be dogma... they keep moving the goalposts... every time they&#39;re wrong - 10 or 12 more years, you&#39;ll see! The first Chicken Little story about Global Warming came in 1922. The proponents of Global Warming are also the same proponents who claim that the Earth is overpopulated. Last comment: some of us believe the world cannot be viewed as a Zero-Sum Game. <br /><br /><br /><br />Here is a clever video produced by James Corbett, Canadian by birth, but presently a resident of Japan. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huKY5DzrcLI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huKY5DzrcLI</a>	UCv1GWJle-pyCaudPXDZG_uA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCv1GWJle-pyCaudPXDZG_uA	0

Nuclear energy is an example, i would also imagine fusion since many scientists have been tirelessly researching it for the past 50 years and can change the energy industry forever, considering our technology and intelligent people living today would not be surprised if it came into reality in 50 years, so whats the rush? do your research everyone and God bless. Im a 23 year old millennial and i think our generations and the upcoming ones will find solutions, try to leave this on us.

The evolution of any species includes their effort to survive, adapt, by changing their environment, habitat to improve. Even if nature is in a warming cycle, do we ignore our perception and blindly accept it, or do we strive to contribute to the improvement of the planet, using our innate skills, abilities, and determination?

First you get a temperature increase and only then do you get CO2 levels rising. Climate change declares it in a different order despite the evidence. In addition, just a couple of volcanic eruptions puts more CO2 and other toxins into the atmosphere than all human activity over the last 100 years. In short, if we have an impact, it&#39;s a minor impact on a year to year basis and a negligible impact over multiple decades when compared to other routine natural events (i.e. volcanic eruptions) that happen all of the time. There is a great deal of information available and a lot more to the issue than what you&#39;ve put on the board. Having said that, I agree with you that the debate is not and should not be over. Climate change is not merely a propaganda tool to get votes. It has more to do with transferring more power to the state over individuals and curtailing freedom and liberty than it does getting votes. Look into Bjorn Lomborg who advocates for our adapting to changing climate rather than trying to arrest its change.

And it is not going to solve the worlds problems.<br /><br />Why aren&#39;t we talking about undenialable issues which have nothing to do with climate change.. The following is what we all depend on and take for granted:<br />Ecosystem destruction,<br />Habitat loss,<br />Deforestation, <br />Plant and animal extinction as well as many species endangered,<br />Soil erosion from over farming &amp; not utilising &amp; encouraging native flora and fauna through proper land managenent<br />Lack of biodiversity,<br />Plastic waste, e-waste and pollution choking our oceans, waterways and eco systems,<br />Overpopulation, talking about birth rates / setting a 1-2 child policy <br />List goes on...<br /><br />At the end if the day the whole infrastructure &amp; the way we live has to change as it is not sustainable. Our domesticated consumer lifestyles dictate us and our choices. The world is built upon money, greed and power. We have multinational corporations at war with the planet and fucking it up all in the name of profit and capitalism....And with populations constantly expanding there is going to be a need for more resources, more land, more houses, more jobs which means more stress on eco systems.. <br /><br />We really need to go back to nature and get guidance from native indigenous people for how they lived and created a sustainable environment for thousands of years..they hold the knowledge and wisdom. We would have to throw the way we live out the window...but I am not sure that is feasable for people that have mortgages, debts...etc and we would also need to give up our creature comforts which isnt going to happen realistically.<br /><br />What happens if we go full renewable? Surely there will be a side effect of that regarding waste / by product?<br /><br />Furthermore I want to make a point that overpopulation is an issue....say using natural renewable resources such as wood as a primary source of heating &amp; cooking as it was for thousands of years, we would have no trees left..<br /><br />The problems are out of our control if we continue living this lifestyle model.<br /><br />I have lost hope for the human race getting our shit together..I realised I was being naive as the scale of the problems are out of proporation...I have decided I just want to live the rest of my life having fun with friends and family do the best I can to reduce waste and live as sustainably as possible in my life.

Unfortunately the left don&#39;t want to debate, unless its with people that agree with them.<br /><br /><br />I’ve been studying “climate change” for the last 5 years not long I know, but I like to hear from both sides. Until I started to study it, I was on the fence about climate change. Since I have been studying it, I do believe in climate change because the climate will always change BUT humans have very little impact on it. All the evidence, facts and data (not feelings) suggest that we have very little to do with it less the 3%. I find it very hard to find evidence to support climate change. Every time I approach a media out let or read an article that supports climate change I can ALMOST never get the source of information, evidence, data or even who conducted the work from them. That’s what bugs me, or the will take data, from a graph for example and only show a portion of the graph that favours there view, two Physicists Wille Soon and “Co2” physicist Professor William Harper point this out in a few of his write ups and talks on climate change. <br /><br /><br />Every prediction that these climate alarmist have come up with have been wrong. 2005 Climate genius Al Gore predicts ice free arctic by 2013, 1966 all oil will be gone in 20 years, 2008 your children won’t know what snow is by 2020, 1988 Maldive and Philippine islands will be underwater by 2018. Yet people still believe them and we are not allowed to ask questions otherwise your a bad person (climate denier). If you took your car to a mechanic with a flat tyre and come out with a brand new engine, are you going to ask questions or just trust them because there a mechanic? <br /><br /><br />Scientist once believed that earth was flat since then it has been proven otherwise, what’s to say there wrong about climate change but the people who support it never want to discuss it. Especially if you’re not a scientist and just shout you down but yet there front spokesperson at the moment, is a child (Greta Thunberg) which I believe, but could be wrong she isn’t a scientist. I’m from Australia and the was an interview on the radio that got played everywhere, it was a 90yr old man saying it’s the driest year of his time and media ran with it like no tomorrow. Ninety years, let’s pretend that the earth is 2000 years old quite possibly older, but 90 out of 2000 years is approximately 5% so we are willing to run with 5% of data, if we took 5% of votes at the next general election and run with that, there would be and uproar. I will continue to study both sides of climate change but at the end of the day it’s all about evidence.	UC4yvQ81eKqx47kOotZPS4nQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4yvQ81eKqx47kOotZPS4nQ	0

We can tell because there’s evidence past temperature rises were mostly localized to events or regions. The alacrity of the current warming is <b>global</b> and that is unprecedented from what scientists have retrieved from Earth’s past. I suggest investigating that data to fully have the answers you’re looking for. <a href="https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/climate/faq/is-the-current-climate-change-unusual-compared-to-earlier-changes-in-earth2019s-history">https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/climate/faq/is-the-current-climate-change-unusual-compared-to-earlier-changes-in-earth2019s-history</a>	UCCMKDSxpQUKHYpIQAPr8VEg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCMKDSxpQUKHYpIQAPr8VEg	0

Scientists keep working on understanding past global climate changes and they’re finding that never in history has the global climate changed this quickly. Past climate changes took place over thousands of years. And yes, math is just a model but its one of the most real things that humans can communicate.

How can humans reduce temperature? Total CO2 is 0.04%<br />human contribution is 0.0012%. Water vapour is 99%. The Sun is the driver of climate change causing both global warming and cooling. A grand solar minimum is coming - WINTER IS COMING - The big freeze will be cold pill to swallow for those claim and want global warming to pay their fees and drive their agenda.

Why they are so to save the climate, but want to turn the world to a socialism government. One government.<br />Some also say that human kind is responsible for only 4% of all CO2, even climate scientists that belive world will have problems.<br />There is no scientist that say that world will end in 12 year, non!<br />Makes you wonder really.<br /><br />So who shall one listen to?<br />I have survived acid rain, it was said it would be so bad that it would melt our flesh from our bones. This would happen in 10 years time.<br />Didn&#39;t happen.<br />Then we was to drown, as ice caps was melting and a sea rise on whooping 50-100m rise. Same time line 10 years. Wel it didn&#39;t happen.<br />Then the hole in the ozone layer, that would bbq us all in a 10 year period. Did t happen.<br /><br />Now we all shall drown and be cooked if we do t change our ways.<br />12 years time, that&#39;s it, and we are yet again doomed.<br />Not gonna happen, as fear is a important tool to keep people in line.<br />There are countries that gonna ban fossile fuels in a couple of years. It will, sad to say, fun to see how it all will crash and burn.<br />Literally.<br /><br />Good video, but I do notice your seem to be believing that climate change will cook you in 12 years, as, well you did put up so mutch on the activist side compared to the skeptics.<br />Hope you will get that debate up and running, I do know the sceptics will show, the climate scientists will not.

Recently the Canadian government removed 150 years worth of weather data because it showed that it was much colder than now. It was only in the 1970s that we got global satellite weather data.<br />- The Earth is getting greener. (search NASA global greening and you can see images)<br />- The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has increased. The amount in atmosphere is 407.4 parts per million which is same as 800,000 years ago. There seems to be cycle which is really consistent where CO2 increases and decreases. <br />- 3.4 percent of annual CO2 emissions are man made. Meaning 96.6% is natural. (volcanoes, oceans, etc.)<br />- the number of forest fires and severe storms are at actual historic lows. But these are also cyclical. <br /><br />- most of the Inconvenient Truths were inconveniently false.<br />- World isn&#39;t going to end in 12 years.

It would be difficult to frame as there are enough complexities in the science to make the debate difficult to follow. You appear a centrist on this question, and perhaps you would frame the debate fairly; I hope so. Would it concern only the science or that and the policies. How would you represent the sides of the scientific debate? 50/50 would not be representative of how climate scientists view this question whatever you think of the 97% consensus claimed by Oreskes. Context matters. Here are two points: timeframes of change. Sure nature produces ice ages and high oceans - those changes have spanned eons in the past, while the greenhouse effect the scientific consensus claims is dramatically sped now. Thus the hockey stick. Finally those that deny the AGCC premise are skilled in the fish Gallup. All they need to do is support the status quo and have not provided solid explanations of warming. Witness the snark hunt around total solar irradiance. I’m a lay person. I’ve spent years thinking about this. I’ve entertained skeptic arguments and all I see is delaying tactics. Good luck with your debate.	UCDItBPcTcW-qQDuqyB-k2yA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDItBPcTcW-qQDuqyB-k2yA	0

In the 70&#39;s was an ice age, then acid rain, then ozone layer, then global warming and NOW the new and improved all encompassing &quot;Climate Change&quot; label which can cover sea level rise or fall, heat or cold etc etc. Climate does change but what shouldn&#39;t is common sense and governments claiming there is no debate is BS.

UgzIDeskrW_9Pr4cHTl4AaABAg	7	4	2019-11-21 20:36:59	Jason Seow	Hoo boy! There&#39;s a lot to cover here. I&#39;ll stick to the main points in the center of the board. Keep in mind that<br /><br />The climate HAS always been changing and we have a pretty good understanding of the cyclic nature of that change. The shift in the last 150 some odd years is orders of magnitude larger than anything that the normal variations can account for.<br /><br />If you look at the number of species that are going extinct, we&#39;re already in a mass extinction and have been for thousands of years. Many scientists say that we have entered a new period in earth&#39;s history that they&#39;re calling the Anthropocene. Climate change will accelerate this mass extinction event.<br /><br />World-wide we are rapidly loosing ice sheets due to global warming. That is a fact.<br /><br />Politicians, by and large, have been more inclined to deny man made climate change. If there a trend in political propaganda, it&#39;s mostly working towards denial, not alarmism.<br /><br />Al Gore did exaggerate climate change. His films on this topic are not reliable sources of information. Given the sorry state of science journalism today, going into peer reviewed scientific journals is almost required to get a fair picture of climate change. If you have access to scientific journals through a university library and are interested in the topic, I recommend delving into the literature on the subject.<br /><br />We cannot confirm that more deaths have resulted from heat waves recently because we lack data from the past.<br /><br />It is a fact that the earth is warming and every model we&#39;ve got shows that warming will accelerate as time goes on. Additionally, even small changes to global temperatures can have severe impacts on ecosystems around the globe, particularly in our Oceans.<br /><br />There is documentation of fossil fuel companies funding climate denial. The IPCC thing is conspiracy nonsense.<br /><br />I&#39;d like to end this by saying that giving deniers a stage to debate climate scientists is a bad idea. By doing so, you are essentially legitimizing their arguments when they simply do not have merit. Science always has a component of uncertainty to it and deniers have used that uncertainty to argue that doubt is warranted. They&#39;re able to do this because the general public is widely ignorant on science and on statistics. For this reason, I&#39;m not too bothered by statements made to the general public that unequivocally state climate change is a problem without any caveats. We do have problems with alarmist politicians who lack a complete understanding of the science and they tend to use inflammatory rhetoric because that&#39;s what people respond to. This is still no reason to elevate denialism by perpetuating the notion that there is a legitimate scientific basis for doubting climate change at this point. It&#39;s also worth mentioning that we&#39;re all ready set for a couple of degrees C of warming over the next century and there&#39;s nothing we can do to change that. If we continue to ignore this problem we could be looking at double or even triple that amount of warming over that same period of time. The costs associated with climate change dwarf those of moving our energy infrastructure to be carbon neutral. Failing to adequately act on climate change is just short sighted, plain and simple.

Extinction: We say a species is extinct after we have confidence that there are few enough members of that species to survive. Proving any one species is extinct is extinct is in principle impossible by definition because it is not possible to prove a negative. Thus the burden of proof is on the survival of that species. We don't just accept that Tyrannosaurs, Sasquatch and Unicorns are running around somewhere. False negatives and false positives average each-other out with large sample sizes. Because of this we can be much more certain in the rate of extinction than we can be that any individual species is extinct, in the same way we can be more sure that some people died today, than we can be of some individual person. Science/theory: Our entire scientific understanding is based on theories. We never prove a theory(that is not possible). Instead, we set out to falsify or rule out that theory. Failure to falsify that theory means that our theory is more robust. Is there anything else you need explained?

I call that a mass extinction. A Milankovitch cycle has a period of about 100,000 years. You're comment, claiming that one caused a 7 degree shift in climate shows me that you probably don't understand Milankovitch cycles or orders of magnitude. It also seem extremely likely that you're pulling those numbers from your ass.	UCgE3kbC07DrgzaF2GiM9XYA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgE3kbC07DrgzaF2GiM9XYA	1	UgzIDeskrW_9Pr4cHTl4AaABAg	Jason Seow

That wasn't long cycle Milankovitch change...that was less than 150 years. And the temperature record by proxies (before 1920) Do not have the resolution to determine what happened on time scales shorter than 150 years SO IT CANNOT BE KNOWN what short term changes occurred in the past or the RATES OF CHANGE using current proxies. Unless we find better proxies we'll never know. So you cannot make any comparisons of the present rate of 0.75 C per century to unknown short term rates WHICH ARE CERTAIN to have happened. The 1930's were WAY warmer by the historical record all over the globe...before CO2 broke over 270 ppm. Climate can change fast without human forcings.

I'd like to point out that those 3 cold centuries were immediately preceding the industrial revolution. Our planet has never seen an increase in temperature as rapid as the current warming trend. 1.5 degrees over 150 years or so, is completely unprecedented. Temperatures are tracking CO2 concentrations and I'm not sure where you're getting this "immediate radiative" response" from. That is not how any of this works. Renewable energy being more expensive was a problem a couple of decades ago. Today the technology is competitive and in some cases cheaper than fossil fuels. Your world wide poverty claim is simply not true. On the contrary, the costs of dealing with climate change are MUCH higher than switching our infrastructure to get off of fossil fuels, overall. I'm actually all for nuclear power. As I said in the OP: we're already locked in for a couple more degrees of warming over the next century. That by no means is a good reason to continue to insist on making things worse. I'm sorry that the truth doesn't matter to you and that you see this as only a political battle. Solving these issues may or may not be easier in a socialist economy but there is no reason why capitalism couldn't be mobilized to solve climate change. One potential start to doing this could be as simple as holding corporations accountable for the externalities that they regularly make the financial burden of the powerless. Between the two of us, it would seem that you're the one ignoring reality because you feel that acknowledging it somehow threatens your political ideology.

The Little Ice Age ending 200 years ago was so cold that it wiped out a large fraction of the population. It's now only 1.5 degrees warmer than the depths of those cold 3 centuries...and still over a degree cooler than earlier Holocene warm periods WHEN CIVILIZATIONS PROSPERED THE MOST. Temperatures are NOT tracking CO2 at ANY time scale...and IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE AN IMMEDIATE RADIATIVE RESPONSE. Doesn't matter because populations are already revolting at the high energy prices and THE PRICED WILL HAVE TO GET 3 TIMES HIGHER to meet emissions goals. Germany has paid the highest price, and HAVE BARELY MADE A DENT in overall emissions. Futile. without Nuclear Energy OR worldwide poverty. I don't know why bother.....the truth doesn't matter...this is all a political battle. And popular uprisings won't allow the Socialists to impoverish them WHEN CLIMATE RELATED FATALITIES CONTINUE TO DECLINE.

CO2 does not have any properties that trap heat rays or light and it&#39;s way too rare in our atmosphere. We as humans are obviously contributing to the weather, climate, eco system, all of it, but CO2 is NOT the big evil, it&#39;s not causing any sort of sun rays to be trapped in the atmosphere. Our big cities and deforestation is probably contributing to certain amount of temperature increase, I mean concrete and metal gets way more hotter than earth or grass or just anything from nature and it retains heat longer. So a decent temperature increase is purely from that, but again the overall climate, the overall temperature is natural and CO2 has nothing to do with it.<br /><br /><br />New measurements at Volcanos, show Iceland&#39;s Katla volcano emits 12–24 kilotons of CO2 per day. That means 6570 tons per year if we take an average approach, that is just one volcano, there are literally thousands of active volcanoes on ground and an estimation of millions of volcanoes underwater. And again plants breathe CO2, its not bad.	UCbigvKFMTwsUX1FBhvYY6Tg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbigvKFMTwsUX1FBhvYY6Tg	0

Unless you&#39;re willing to give up your cell phone, your computer, the interior and exterior of your car body, most of your appliances and EVERYTHING you use that is made of plastic, understand that WE WILL be a fossil fuel economy for the next 50 to 100 years. We need to be GRATEFUL for fossil fuels and the brave, smart men who harnessed it to make our lives so comfortable. However, the GREEN lobby is quite dangerous. Those people invested heavily in green energy and it&#39;s NOT paying off. Lastly, we currently have 410ppm of C02 in our atmosphere. In the Cambrian, (PROVEN from ice cores and other means), C02 was 7,000ppm. Life absolutely EXPLODED on earth and in the oceans. The oceans were not acidified. C02 is PLANT FOOD. The earth is greening. South Africa can now grow enough crops to feed it&#39;s people. Everybody breathe and let nature do what it does. Also, take a look at the Milankovich cycles. Very important here.	UCqzVvtbrEpDenAHT4EYp2fA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqzVvtbrEpDenAHT4EYp2fA	0

It is human contribution to a catastrophic and unnatural climate change that is in question. Three big questions attend that question: What is the value of assessing a global average mean temperature? What is the ideal global average mean temperature? And what is the projected reduction of global average mean temperature in the next 50-100 years should we return to pre-industrial carbon emissions? Then there are several other questions: What might be some benefits to a warmer planet? Do we have the ability to adapt to a slightly warmer planet? What might be the human cost of forcing a radical agenda to curb emissions?	UCGt877OLUvNYbBuU_rFHWZQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGt877OLUvNYbBuU_rFHWZQ	1	UgzbSFtmU1WP2G_JQZp4AaABAg	Heidi M

Broad spectrum radiation comes in and often changes to heat where it gets stuck (a lot of radiation changes to heat waves on the earth&#39;s surface, and greenhouse gasses are the ones that selectively block heat waves).<br /><br />2. You&#39;ve ignored the importance of feedback loops in the debates. More heat means more plants (negative feedback). More heat means ice melts, releasing trapped greenhouse gasses (positive feedback). More heat makes water evaporates (positive feedback from water vapor, negative feedback from more snow reflecting broad spectrum radiation). It&#39;s complicated. The debate is often &quot;well, there&#39;s a certain amount of feedback now, but if the system changes at different temperatures maybe it will magically become a lot more or a lot less&quot; (depending on which side you&#39;re on). The system might theoretically stabilise or end up in explosive runaway feedback. My view is that this uncertainty tends to increase the risk - you don&#39;t hop on a plane just because people say &quot;all the engineers analysing it don&#39;t know what they&#39;re talking about&quot;.<br /><br />3. A lot of climate change scientists feel like they&#39;re not the best debaters, especially in an open format. They might want something more moderated and trial-like?

How fast is that system, can our inputs out run its control to the point the climate becomes unlivable?

Take a look at the following statement from the 1991 book: <br /> <br />&quot;In searching for a common enemy against whom we can unite, we came up with the idea that pollution, First Global Revolutionthe threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the like, would fit the bill. In their totality and their interactions these phenomena do constitute a common threat which must be confronted by everyone together.&quot; (The First Global Revolution - A Report by the Council of the Club of Rome, p.75) <br /> <br />As you can see from the above quote, the Club of Rome admitted to &#39;coming up with the idea&#39; that &#39;global warming&#39;, (now called &#39;climate change&#39; because facts prove the earth isn&#39;t warming as they said it would) could be used as a &#39;common enemy&#39; to unite the world together.

The rise isn't what's concerning its the acceleration that is the problem. Also plants only thrive on CO2 in greenhouses where all other variables are controlled such as fertilization etc. You can't just keep throwing CO2 at plants and expecting them to improve indefinitely. Also consider how CO2 effects water and other parts of the environment. Im not saying you should be alarmed at all but your comment just mimics alot of ignorant rhetoric around here...

So I assumed you wouldn’t want to tarnish your image by giving any legitimacy to climate-skeptics.<br /><br />I myself believe that of course human consumption is causing a buildup of CO2 (and other greenhouse gases) into the atmosphere. That greenhouse gas can be demonstrated to store heat on Earth’s surface. But the number one greenhouse gas is water vapor. Now, water vapor is complex because on one hand it strongly absorbs the infra-red region of the spectrum, causing more heat to be stored from the sun. But on the other hand, water vapor also creates clouds, which can mitigate surface temperatures. The rate of warming may require further investigation. But the mainstream consensus seems to be consistent that the warming is fairly predictable, despite some areas of uncertainty.<br /><br />In any event, I would like to hear a three hour debate on climate change. Because as voters, our voices matter in shaping the economy and the ecology of planet Earth.	UCgxDYyI599n9pV1aV8aZjcw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgxDYyI599n9pV1aV8aZjcw	0

Raw data across the US shows slight cooling over the past century. Only the US data extends to 1900 and before then. Obviously the planet has been warming since 1780 when Cook tried to sail to the north west passage and could not get north of Glacier Bay. Glaciers are still melting now, but the data that shows CO2 connection looks very much like it has been massaged. Refer to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzGPq9LSjEw&amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzGPq9LSjEw&amp;feature=youtu.be</a> to see the astounding manipulation of weather data that has been foisted onto the public.

You clearly stated, " *it's a well known fact in the scientific community that warming over the past centuries have caused a rise in atmospheric CO2 through obvious reasons such as volcanic activity, solar activity (I.E. expansion/contraction, drier climates causing fires, etc)* " And I've given actual scientific sources completely debunking your claims of volcanic or solar activity being responsible for the recent spike in warming and CO2. Just give up, you're wrong and no amount of obfuscation and misuse of terms is going to change that. After totally dismantling your solar and volcanic claims you still choose to display your ignorance by claiming we don't know the amounts of CO2 being absorbed and emitted from various sources however, that is known as Earth's Carbon Cycle. The carbon cycle is the entirety of earth's CO2 intake and output, and this input and output has been measured both historically and in modern times. Historically it's stable but human activity has been disturbing it and adding to it. "Today, changes in the carbon cycle are happening because of people. We perturb the carbon cycle by burning fossil fuels and clearing land." https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/CarbonCycle Seriously just give up.

This absolutely absurd standard of evidence is perfectly demonstrative of either your overwhelming ignorance or dishonesty towards this subject. How do scientists account for human CO2 vs Volcanos? "Another indication that human emissions dwarf those of volcanoes is the fact that atmospheric CO2 levels, as measured by sampling stations around the world set up by the federally funded Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center, have gone up consistently year after year regardless of whether or not there have been major volcanic eruptions in specific years. “If it were true that individual volcanic eruptions dominated human emissions and were causing the rise in carbon dioxide concentrations, then these carbon dioxide records would be full of spikes—one for each eruption,” " https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/earthtalks-volcanoes-or-humans/ You can't ignorantly bitch about our lack of ability to track CO2 production of human industry versus earth's volcanism, just assuming you have a "gotcha". We have CO2 stations all around the globe set up by hundreds of independent governmental and private institutions as well as seismographs recording for eruptions that also corroborate the fact that volcanism has been steady. You have no point to he proven only absurd accusations as well as impossible and quite frankly irrelevant standards of evidence. Just GTFO of this conversation with this dishonesty.

How do you not grasp the fact that they accounted for CO2 emissions from volcanic activity and compared it to that of human activity? And yes! Volcanic CO2 emissions account for ~200 *million* tons of CO2 while humans account for ~24 *Billion* tons of CO2. One is larger than the other, 200 million goes into 24 Billion *120 times* unless you failed the 3rd grade math even you should be able to understand this simple arithmetic. I'm not rewording anything, you're obviously under the false assumption that the previous 800 years of *gradual warming* "minus the anthropogenic spike" magically turned into the modern climate of rapid heating and rapid CO2 rise. You do understand that you can't just ignore the "anthropogenic spike" when discussing modern warming trends? Because the gradual rise prior to industrialization simply can't get you to where we are, there wasn't enough CO2 being naturally emitted to account for modern conditions. About your other argument, "There are holes left in theories that we can't account for yet," Again you're participating in fallacious thinking. Gaps in our understanding of helioseismology are irrelevant when, by every possible metric we have today, the sun's activity has been steady or in decline while CO2 and Temperature have been soaring. https://climate.nasa.gov/news/878/a-quiet-interlude-in-solar-max/ It's like you're wanting there to be a boogieman hiding in the sun causing all that we see, but there simply isn't. You're making a claim without any evidence! (We don't know X, Therefore it must be Y) When in reality when we don't know something we simply don't know it, we can't *not* know something and jump to us *knowing* it must be something! This is how you sound right now. (You don't know what made the book fall off the shelf. Therefore it must have been a ghost!) (We don't know everything about the sun. Therefore it has to be the sun.) If you're not claiming it's the sun, then what is your point? Are you arguing that we can make any claims (even when these claims are backed up with mountains of evidence) simply because we don't know something? Back in reality however, the sun has been steady, volcanoes have been steady, while humans have been adding Gigatons of CO2 to the atmosphere. This rapid rise in CO2 has been trapping more solar radiation than before, heating the planet, the planet heats and melts ice, the ice melts releasing more CO2 and lowers the earth's albedo, more CO2 is released by melting ice and less ice makes earth absorb more solar radiation creating a positive feedback of warming. (Inter-glacier Period/Hothouse Earth from 100 million years ago) Here's the catch though, *you're 100% correct that the Sun and it's activity is the primary controller of earths climate.* *When solar activity in the past dropped (and/or axial tilt increased/decreased) it cooled the oceans, the cooling oceans absorbed more CO2, less CO2 caused earth to absorb less solar radiation and dropped the earth's temp, this creates a negative feedback loop. (IceAge)* Okay, I read through the link you provided and here's a quote from the conclusion section. " *CO2 continues to dominate anthropogenic warming.* For the current crop of emission scenarios from the integrated assessment community (Weyant et al., 2006; Van Vuuren et al., 2008), *the contribution of CO2 to the anthropogenic warming by 2100 is estimated* using an emission-driven climate model *to be 58 to 76% of that of all greenhouse gases together* (Strassmann et al., 2009). *Independent from the choice of emission metric,* the long life time of the anthropogenic CO2 perturbation implies that anthropogenic emissions of CO2 must be reduced if greenhouse gas forcing and anthropogenic climate change are to be stabilized (Siegenthaler and Oeschger, 1978)." Sooo yeah, your source explains that given CO2's long halflife in the atmosphere due to the fact that it's less reactive than other Greenhouse Gases, it accounts for 58% to 76% anthropogenic warming. Your source isn't agreeing with your conclusions.	UCWQX9VOPWgO83knocgeGB5A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWQX9VOPWgO83knocgeGB5A	1	UgzHU2zB8238EZj5Yg14AaABAg	Keith Strang

Which is why scientists have already done this, and you know what they found? Volcanic activity has been remarkably stable for centuries, whereas human activity has outpaced the CO2 release of volcanic activity by something approaching 120X. "According to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the world’s volcanoes, both on land and undersea, generate about 200 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) annually, while our automotive and industrial activities cause some 24 billion tons of CO2 emissions every year worldwide. Despite the arguments to the contrary, the facts speak for themselves." https://www.climate.gov/news-features/climate-qa/which-emits-more-carbon-dioxide-volcanoes-or-human-activities https://scied.ucar.edu/longcontent/changing-carbon-cycle You do understand that we can measure human CO2 output, right? https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11638-climate-myths-human-co2-emissions-are-too-tiny-to-matter/ As for the solar activity being responsible for rising CO2 levels, solar activity in general has been very stable and in fact has been slightly decreasing over the last few decades. "The solar contribution is small –- close to zero over the last 50 years." “The period of greatest warming – since about 1975 – has coincided with a slight decrease in solar activity.” https://climate.nasa.gov/blog/2910/what-is-the-suns-role-in-climate-change/ https://www.carbonbrief.org/why-the-sun-is-not-responsible-for-recent-climate-change You're trying bitch about how we don't understand the sun well enough and we're relying on TSI measurements, but by what other metric or method would you like to purpose that would allow for reduced solar activity to account for rising CO2? You're basically using the gaps or assumed gaps in scientific knowledge to insert an un-falsifiable hypothesis that by some unknown method the sun is still responsible for sudden for CO2 rise absent increase in solar activity and in the face of decreased solar activity. -As an addendum: No one has "Denied solar forcing." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiative_forcing "No. The Sun can influence the Earth’s climate, but it isn’t responsible for the warming trend we’ve seen over the past few decades." https://climate.nasa.gov/faq/14/is-the-sun-causing-global-warming/ https://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/energy-budget.html	UCWQX9VOPWgO83knocgeGB5A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWQX9VOPWgO83knocgeGB5A	1	UgzHU2zB8238EZj5Yg14AaABAg	Keith Strang

What you are left with is still a useful nugget which describes incredibly well what you are studying, but it’s still falls short of the pure truth. All I’m saying is that if the history of humans practicing the scientific method has thought us anything, it’s that it can’t provide us with certainty.

The reason I am not invoking the argument ad populum is because the thousands of scientists over time have challenged each others findings and have all come to the same conclusions via different experimentation and in different fields.

In order for you to overturn that you need more than just your bullshit assertions or your empty thought experiments. You dont have data and the idiots that claim to have data either misinterpret their data or dont have anything meaningful. CO2 absorbs and radiates IR radiation, if you dont know this then you dont know anything. Find papers on IR spectroscopy and educate yourself on this very basic reality. Yes water and methane absorb more but they have different and shorter cycles in the atmosphere. Also you pose that heating comes before CO2 increases, this is true in earths geological history, this is NOT THE CASE OF CURRENT WARMING. You seem to have trouble with the idea that something can be true in two different scenarios. CO2 can both lag and lead temp hikes. Finally you are confusing the idea that the earth needs other green house gases along with CO2 in order to maintain its current warmth ( true statement), with this bullshit idea that CO2 needs other gases in order to absorb IR radiation. CO2 absorbs IR radiation with or without other gases present.

So if the SUN is what controlls the temperature and other electromagnetic effects then it would make sense that we feel a Climate Change. So the reason behind climate change is a lie.

Global warming is not caused by humans but it’s acceleration it is definitely caused by humans. While I’m writing this it’s November 21 2019 and today there were 18 degrees (Celsius) in my country where normally by this time there should be around -2 - 7 degrees, it’s way too warm. Every year it gets warmer. In my country in the winter time there should be -20 degrees but we didn’t had that in the last 6 years.

You have a god given right to believe what you wish, as I have mine. However in 1980 I was at school (age 10) and was told in no uncertain terms that where I lived would become a coastal town by the time I was 40 due to global warming and sea rise. I live 50 miles from nearest coast! I couldn’t wait. I now go to that same town and have to take binoculars to see the sea it has receded so much. I agree the climate is changing, and the planet has warmed but now we are in for a cold period and if everything comes to fruition a very long one too. The sun causes these events by going through cycles. We will never change this whatever we do!!!! Peace...

They fire their own scientists that present findings they don&#39;t like. this is not how science is done and makes it obvious they are engaging in a scam. 3) look at the proposals and its quite obvious these assholes are hell bent on genocide and enslavement of mankind - ending ALL carbon emissions by 2025? anyone with a brain can see that would mean billions of deaths from starvation - it gets worse from there but you get the idea	UCzAH2oGqwKxyRudc4R4aucA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzAH2oGqwKxyRudc4R4aucA	0

Well let me tell you, despite all the evidence lots of people had to be punished for believing in that. Because climate change involves some changes in people's lifestyle, people are programmed to clinge on the easiest thing to believe (no real climate change means not having to do anything) for as long as possible.

No climate scientist would bother coming on the show, unless they were debating other climate scientists, so best of luck with finding a climate scientist willing to come on, I work in science, yes a totally different field, I design and manufacture vaccines, no way would I debate the opponents of vaccinations, because it all relies on conspiracy theories, similar scenario.

The climate has always been changing how else you wanna explain summer and winter? and you do know the sun has sycles right? and you do know more people die from cold than heat right? and you do know tornados was much worse in the past right? and you do know in 1974 scientists where preddicting another mini ice age, even tho the governmanets climate scientists today say the earth has been heating up since 1800? and the scientists that claimed we had an emangcy, was not even scientists? and the ice in antartic is getting thicker? nasa them self has shown it... and the list goes on and on... and if people think that the 0,04% CO2 in the atmosphere has more to say than the SUN and the 4% water vapor in the atmosphere... well then you have all lost your minds and let the governments climate propagand take over your life... so congratulations, you have now all become brainless drones... CO2 is the cause of ALL life on earth, we exhale CO2, but now all of the sudden it&#39;s the CO2 that brings life, is now the cause of the world ending???

I see this on the local level with the government shutting of nature to the population, and forcing us to stay in the cities. This can something as simple as shutting off BLM land to off-road recreation. Then they tax us hard &quot;in the name of the environment&quot;. The government has hired scientists to push their agenda, and some of us saw through it. <br /> <br />There is no end to it. If individuals prove that there is no climate change, the government will hire a thousand more scientists to say it&#39;s real. There is too much regulation at will &quot;in the name of the environment&quot; connected to it. Also, there is soooo much money being sucked out of us feeding their machine with a happy little Evironmental Protection Agencies.

Reference the flooding in Venice, Venice is flooded worse in the 1920s, and particularly in the 1700 and 1800s, reference America in the dust bowl in the 1920s, that is the reason why a lot of NASA data only goes back to the 30s	UCTluep70pD-FO__irvjEQ8A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTluep70pD-FO__irvjEQ8A	0

You wouldn't be using the tired argument of the O&G industrial playbook" How am I feeding into the mainstream? How am I parroting bits and pieces from the media? Why should I take your word that you've spent years paying attention to scientific fields? That's as credible as me saying I've spent years researching climate change and come to the conclusion that it is real. Both statements are completely useless without evidence to back it up. What studies have you seen that contradict climate change in Helioseismology, Meteorology and Atmospheric Science? I'm not trying to be a dick here I genuinely want to know of any scientific papers that disagree. Also, why couldn't you be bothered to provide me with a scientific journal? Again, if this is so easy to debunk (as is the vibe I'm getting from your comments) it shouldn't be hard to produce a source. Also, I'm gonna need a citation for your entire third paragraph.

Again, if you have a scientific paper that says it's not happening like we think it is, I won't reject it, I'll accept it because I simply want to find the truth.

No point debating the Science as it represents the knowledge of mankind. Greed is designed to, and by far powerful enough to discredit it. There is no compelling factual scientific evidence that will avert what is inevitable. Patrick can keep mindlessly consuming his material possessions for his children to bear the burden of. Biologically it is often observed that parasites (ie. viruses) eventually over run and destroy their hosts at their own peril. We are humans doing the same. Nothing unnatural here!

NASA, for the longest time, proposed that the rotational tilt of the earth over time was the cause for climate change. Carbon could be a factor but we don&#39;t know. Nobody claims to know which is the biggest factor in climate change. Most scientists, if they were allowed to be heard, would tell you that it is probably a combination of the two factors. We can&#39;t control the rotational tilt as this is a natural phenomenon. We have some control over our carbon output. <br /><br /><br />More than likely, we won&#39;t be able to curb our carbon output over the next 50 years. The focus should be on making adjustments to living in a warmer environment.	UCbwYtxZp9NV-GlFFW_yjwfg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbwYtxZp9NV-GlFFW_yjwfg	0

Let me tell you something EVEN IF this is a natural cycle we as humans with our current activities are my dear sir SPEEDING up the process and 11,000 scientist not an EXXON CEO or any other oil producer came out just within this month to confirm this. We are accelerating the process and it&#39;s proven, look up the correlation of rising temp. And the industrial age. <br />OIL IS POWER and governments base their power sustainability in the savagery of this world and only a few will understand what I mean by this. Example Saudi Araibia, Venesuela, Mexico (Pemex), Canada (Dekota pipe line), China (they want to start selling oil in yen because fuck exchanging oil in only dollars that&#39;s why) <br /> - and ask why the U.S. went into the middle east when they wanted to trade the oil in their currency. <br />Oil is leverage to control other countries. <br /><br />Scientist:<br />They&#39;ve always worked with government to make technical advancments. The government depends on them for tech and they depend on gov for resources, fairly simple. War amps up this process FYI war can be profitable like the creation of tech that can be used to make you phone. Camera, GPS, texting pictures etc. The whole thing.<br /><br />11,000 sientist recently gathered to warn us how we&#39;re headed for a painful time if actions aren&#39;t taken against climate change (or the consumption of oil because we are the couse not climate) <br /><br />Sorry I didn&#39;t want to spend the time to add links but the info to search is there.

Here&#39;s how it works: The atmosphere let&#39;s Sun&#39;s heat energy pass easily through. Once it hits the ground it&#39;s absorbed and re-emitted, but it&#39;s now of lower energy state. This lower energy state has greater trouble passing through the atmosphere, which warms up the planet. This is where Greenhouse gasses come into play. They are partially opaque to these outgoing rays, the more there are GHG&#39;s in the atmoshere, the more of this outbound energy is retained in the atmosphere and the planet warms.

The real atmosphere does not behave in the same way as the artificial atmospheres used in these experiments, repeated and repeated since the 1890s, In these experiments carbon does indeed retain or reflect heat. In the real atmosphere, however - unfettered by a container, much, much larger and open to outer space on one side - carbon molecules retain infra-red photons for approximately one third of a second before disseminating them in various directions. It also appears that these directions are determined by the need for the atmosphere to maintain thermodynamic stability. Albert Einstein, a pretty good physicist, published a theoretical paper in 1917 positing that the atmosphere has to remain stable for a whole variety of sensible reasons. Carbon is not the villain here. As well as enriching plant growth it is part of a sophisticated process whereby the atmosphere is kept in a state of necessary equilibrium. Don't tell anyone this though. Too much money is being made and too much political control is being exercised by promoting restrictions on man-made carbon emissions.

There is so much more to the subject that you din’t talk about but it would take a video way over 10 hours to explain everything about climate change. Here is a few point i like to adds about what you said :<br /><br />1. Antarctica is loosing ice mainly on his peninsula, it gaining more ice on the other side of the continent.<br /><br />2. Venice had way worst flood in the past. The one from 1825 had higher water and the one from 1966 did way more damage than those of this decade money-wise. Also Venice is sinking into the ground giving a illusion that the floods are getting worst.<br /><br />3. Many tried to call for a debate between the different spectrum of climate change beliefs. Few on the man-made spectrum accepted and none were alarmists. Here a recent video on that subject : <a href="https://youtu.be/b8JZo6PzpCU">https://youtu.be/b8JZo6PzpCU</a><br /><br />I will close by saying my conclusion of my search on the subject is close of your’s. I’m sick of being called a climate change denier just for saying that i don’t blindly follow the alarmist point of view...

UgwjbfBdT9tXNj14VH54AaABAg	9	7	2019-11-21 00:40:42	Ricco 247	The main issue with the CC conundrum is that there is no debate. All we get is the one sided view. You rarely see any scientists from either side debating on their evidence. All I want are the actual correct facts about the climate. From what I&#39;ve researched myself (reading, watching and listening to actual scientists from both sides) I&#39;m inclined to believe the sceptic view. The evidence I&#39;ve seen is more in depth and thorough. I also believe that anyone can be bought and coerced no matter how intelligent you are. So, yes the IPCC could be under financial influence and the sceptics.The CC believers argument offers far far more investment options to business in so many ways. It pushes the use of new tech, electric cars (which we&#39;ll all have to have as fossil fuel vehicles will be banned or at least extremely restricted), wind, sea and solar power, scrap metal industry (all those old cars, trucks trains, planes etc) and so on. <br /> The sceptic argument is more fact base, goes further back in earths history, the Milankovitch cycle (look it up on here, very interesting), understands how much changing will cost including very high taxes on everyone, but the tell for me is, it&#39;s very rarely shown on any media outlet. To me that&#39;s very curious as the sceptics aren&#39;t crackpots running around ranting their beliefs, after coming back from a rock climbing trip to Holland, on a UFO. They&#39;re scientists and experts in their appropriate fields. So, WHY the blackout?<br /> Ask yourself this. If CC is really happening and we&#39;re all going to die in 8 years, why aren&#39;t the MSM not presenting the silly sceptics side of the argument to show them up for what they are? Also, if the climate science world is so divided, then surely that tells you that it is not a definite conclusion? Scientists usually only disagree on theories, not normally on facts. So, CC is in essence, just a theory and is not a debate or presenting any undisputable facts whatsoever. We are also seeing thousands of children being used as the front line, making criticism a very dangerous option. That&#39;s another red flag to me too. Just saying.

First of all, I'm asking YOU for the source of YOUR claim that scientists believed in Global Cooling. And by source, I mean just one peer reviewed paper that suggests the Earth will be facing Global Cooling. Just one. It shouldn't be that hard. Now, "warmer is better". Yes, there have been times when the Earth was much warmer (those times were also correlated with a much higher CO2 concentration, but I digress) and yes, living organisms who were perfectly adapted to those conditions thrived. But that's the thing. Sudden change to the climate is very bad news, regardless if it's changing for warmer or for cooler. Plants use CO2 for food, but that's just part of the equation. They use CO2 with water and energy from the sun to make sugar and oxygen. In order to make use of the higher CO2 concentration, you would need more water to be injected. Where will the water come from? Not only that, the warming caused by higher CO2 will in turn cause soils to dry faster, so not only would you need more water to make use of the CO2, you would have to compensate for the water loss due to warming. In conclusion, no, more CO2 would definitely NOT be better for plants.	UCtRTZFTPzhcOjPC5Z2PlpDw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtRTZFTPzhcOjPC5Z2PlpDw	1	UgwjbfBdT9tXNj14VH54AaABAg	Ricco 247

The rest of the _adults_ in the world either don't care and get on with their lives or they have some professional interest in which they conduct their business accordingly. Those that scream loudest get heard the most, Greta thunberg is great example. People ignore scientists for decades but all the sudden get pissed off at a kid lecturing them instead. The irony is that her controversy achieved what she wanted it too. People are talking now more than ever. The extreme deniers don't even realise they fell for the bait.

Once deniers, with or without a degree, exhaust their usual claims their reasoning becomes fallacious because they don&#39;t have sufficient evidence to back up their conspiracies thus rely on slipping in hard to detect informal fallacies mixed with confidence. Another issue is it depends on who is on the debate floor or it can be skewed in favor of whoever is the better speaker. A scientific debate does not work the same way as an online debate. You marketeers need to realize a debate doesn&#39;t decide what&#39;s true and what isn&#39;t. The process is much more rigorous and time consuming and that process is called science.<br /><br />The problem is not solved by a debate. It&#39;s solved by informing people with the most accurate information. Sadly accuracy is not what most people including the media cares about.<br /><br />We are 100% responsible for the initial push that&#39;s shifting the climate to a new state or equilibrium. There are other factors/cycles that can change the climate but are insignificant in comparison and are being overtaken by greenhouse gases.

Go and read the peer-reviewed scientific papers that explain what is happening. It is very clear what is happening. &quot;Both sides&quot; is 98% vs 2%, and a lot of the 2% has since been refuted.

I implore you to keep reading and always be prepared to be wrong. I admit I could be now. But only if we except that we may be wrong will we ever be able to truly learn and understand the world. I tend to take the "if this is true what should I expect to see" route when first encountering any obstacle. This in a sense is the begining of the scientific method. Sounds like you're still quite young and maybe you haven't seen as much of the world for yourself. The internet has very little to do with the real world and a lot more to do with agendas.

While it could be said that chemistry has been underway for 13.84 billion year, it doesn't mean that it had been intentionally practices for that long. The way you're using the word "science" is so vague that it could be applied to literally anything. Back to the chemistry example, even though "chemistry" has been going on that long the word science couldn't be applied to it until the moment it was intentionally used to measure and test the outcomes. So while "science" is, in your use of the word, everywhere it is being used so vaguely that no perimeters for a real conversation could be established. I understand what you think because I use to feel the same way, but it wasn't until I actually researched enough that I realized how manipulated a lot of scientific results were. Numbers never lie, however people do. As a chemist I'm firmly aware of the importance of science but you need to pay attention to what experiments get funded and more importantly, why. If climate change were real and as much of a dire situation as it's portrayed to be then you would see the top .1% unloading money and resources faster than you could blink to save themselves. But they aren't, why? Because it's a ploy to add yet another tax on the people. If you can't see that then please read more.

The bandwith gets saturated, causing diminishing warming per added unit of CO2. Saturationg doesn't mean it gets completely blocked, either. You can paint over red paint and it gets redder, only less so than it would, if there was less paint on the wall. The same applies to warming effect of CO2. It's logarithmic, meaning every doubling causes fixed amount of warming (as opposed to doubled warming). This is well understood, though how much isn't. The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere doesn't get saturated, but some of it does get sequestered. Meaning some of it gets pulled out of the atmosphere. The more there is, the more gets pulled. At least to a point. Most of Earth's existence it has been much warmer and much higher level of CO2. Not exactly a great evidene of it not having an effect.

Global warming and climate change are two phenomena occurring simultaneously, the former is the cause of the latter. Man-made Global warming was first discovered in 1896 after a study conducted to measure the impacts of trains at the time, and it was later discovered that global warming was causing climate change in the 1930s, since then over 10,000 peer reviewed scientific studies have been produced on this subject.

Hopefully you have scientists on the sceptics of climate change side, because most of us don&#39;t have a clue where to start in analyzing this stuff.<br /><br />As for the alarmist &quot;It&#39;s 100% certain, it&#39;s going to kill us all!&quot; camp.

The smallest values estimated are very close to zero while the highest ones are even 9 degrees Celsius for a doubling of CO2. The majority of the papers are using theoretical general circulation models (GCM) for the estimation, these models give very big sensitivities with a very large uncertainty range. Typically sensitivity values are between 2{5 degrees. IPCC uses these papers to estimate the global temperature anomalies and the climate sensitivity. However, there are a lot of papers, where sensitivities lower than one degree are estimated without using GCM. The basic problem there is no evidence of man made climate sensitivity.

I was sick of the way everything was so one sided in the environmental studies field. The conformation bias was almost unbelievable from most people. Its not that they were wrong, (they could well be right) its that they wouldn&#39;t even open the cover on a book that would have even a half assed go at questioning it, because what would they do for a living if it were not man made? These guys would have spent 13 years at school and 5 years at Uni for a mistaken gamble. To be in a room of them felt more like being in a cult than in a room of critical thinkers.

I could find alot more examples. It's all nonsense. Like their "list of 30,000 scientists" that signed a petition to call climate change an emergency. Lmao they literally had people called "Mickey Mouse" and "BS detector". There are way more occurences of "climate scientists with big fat grants" refusing to debate "deniers". And I should add that things like this happen: "Chuck Todd Refuses To Give Air Time To Climate Deniers". These alarmists want less heat and less CO2? They should burn at the stake or get beaten to death, since this is the consequence of lower temperature and lower CO2 and what they want.

If thousands of research papers coming at the problem from different angles all lead to the same conclusion, that conclusion becomes an emergent phenomena, and for all practical purposes it becomes fact.

What about the "what are the effects" step? Because let me tell you since 1880 the effects have all been positive (apart from the man made hysteria).

The consensus of 97% (probably even more than 97%) was that tectonic plates was a stupid idea ;) You can read about this on the NASA website: https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/Wegener/wegener_5.php Here is another more complete article: https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/when-continental-drift-was-considered-pseudoscience-90353214/ Read it, and notice the striking similarities with the irrational "climate change consensus" 😘	UCla_bgXo3A0meHLLYwZW-wQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCla_bgXo3A0meHLLYwZW-wQ	1	UgxQdicNkiSI28T_afd4AaABAg	Money printer go brr

No one is saying temperatures are not higher today than they were in 1880 (at the end of the little ice age). What we are saying is that wow big surprise temperatures go up after a little ice age who would have thought? And no, the world will not end because we released traces of plant food in the atmosphere. And meteorologists, paleontologists, geologists, astrophysicists, etc, as well as educated people with common sense, understand that life is build - literally - by H20 + CO2 (plus don't forget about the energy that makes the reactions happen the most known method being photosynthesis). I would be willing to bet there is a direct correlation between the amount of knowledge people have and them being more skeptical.

Life needs CO2. What could happen? Bigger and more numerous insects? Say global warming is real, then you get huge new areas with life on it, rather just just being frozen. And on the flip side what? A few places will slowly go underwater? What is the worse case scenario if what the alarmists say is true? Like 5% of land gets covered by sea? (While new land mass increase the total by 40%). Big deal. All life on the planet comes from 2 molecules. CO2 and H20. The supersticious gullible apocalypse believers really need to learn about earth history because it is beautiful. First it started with bacteria, single life cells for billions of years. Then multicellular life for about a billion years. Around 540 million years ago when CO2 levels were sky high, haven't been that high since then, what happened was the Cambrian explosion, and that was really the big big explosion, the start of life as we know it. The greatest thing to happen to planet earth since maybe life appeared. CO2 levels on a multi billion years timeframe are on a downtrend, and we were only a few million years away from total extinction of all life on earth except for simple cells that need very little co2 levels. I am not arguing that the economic benefits of emitting CO2 outweight the risk (the potential bad things that may happen). I am saying that IT IS OUR DUTY TO PROTECT LIFE ON THIS PLANET AND AS SUCH WE MUST EMIT AS MUCH CO2 AS WE CAN NO MATTER THE COST. All of the bad things that the UN & cie said would happen did not even happen. The opposite actually. My favorite is the fact that the planet is getting greener, and co2 emissions are literally helping fight the negative effects of human activity (mostly expansion/multiplication which has stopped in the west).

I got the Impression that the Heartland Institute wants a Maybe 1 hour political debate. You don't politically debate About a claim of truth. Sectors that deal with claims of truth, like science and courts, typically take a lot more time and arguments to actually come to one agreeable conclusion. The scientific debate conventionally consists of publishing peer-reviewed scientific papers. Yes, it is a misconception that 97% of scientists agree about man-made climate change. But what the 97% does stand for is that 97% of the debate, the actual established scientific debate, the debate consisting of scientific papers, is being argued in favour of man-made climate change. So if anyone is evading the _appropriate_ type of debate, it's the climate change skeptics.

Likewise with anthropogenic climate change, which is widely accepted as a reality that requires emissions reductions by the scientific community. If you had a life threatening illness would you like to spend your treatment equally between faith healers and professional doctors or would you like to dismiss faith healers entirely and stand a better chance? Do we need to “see both sides” of the issue on whether or not alcohol makes you drunk, whether or not disinfecting your hands before surgery is a good idea, or whether or not a ball will fall when you drop it in a field in Iowa?

If you roll a dice 100 times, the average of the numbers will be close to 3.5. If you roll a dice a million times, the average will be very close, almost exactly, to 3.5. Roll a dice infinitely many times, the average becomes exactly 3.5. Predicting the weather tomorrow is like rolling the dice once, it is impossible to predict. Predicting global climate change is like having rolled the dice everyday for the last many years. We have an average that we know is increasing, and the more days we roll the dice, the more clearly we can see the average increase. You don't need a Phd in climate change to see that it is happening, just a basic understanding of probability and statistics, and the data for earths temperature since ancient times.

Those computers and softwares are much more accurate than you think, they're about 75-80% accurate when predicting week long weather. Mean while the average human can predict the accuracy of weather with about a 50% rate without science. In what ways are these computers wrong and can you prove that the accuracy of these computers and softwares are below 75%. Liks wise as I've said before can you prove that the rising C02 and the loss of natural carbon sinks not affect humans?

The level of CO2 in the atmosphere is only 0.04%, not enough cause a significant greenhouse effect.<br /><br />2. The temperature reporting by NOAA and NASA that the advocates of global warming love to use are actually doctored to show recent increases in temperature levels when in fact the raw data shows a recent decrease in temperature. Often, the instruments used to collect the temperature data are deliberately located near furnace exhaust vents or in blacktop parking areas where there is unusually high temperatures. The global warming advocates never refer to the unbiased satellite and weather balloon data which shows that the global temperature is now going down.<br /><br />3. Careful analysis of the CO2 levels in ice cores shows that while the levels of CO2 do increase as global temperatures increase, however, it is a delayed effect. It is the global warming which causes increases in CO2 and global cooling which causes decreases in CO2 not the other way around. This in itself disproves the greenhouse theory.<br /><br />Finally, we need to look at who these global warming proponents really are. They are liberal activists who want to impose heavy carbon taxes on industry that would destroy the economy and kill jobs. They want the government to subsidize uneconomic energy sources such as wind and solar and ignore new developments in the nuclear power industry such as the thorium salt reactor which would be safer and much less expensive. <br /><br />These people try to present the global warming as if it were an establish scientific fact when in fact it is a political agenda. Anyone who objects to the agenda must be debunked or ridiculed as a denier. It is a tool used by liberal politicians to try to socialize the economy. In our schools and universities global warming is a big piece of the propaganda being fed to our students in an attempt to scare them about a crisis that doesn&#39;t exist and brainwash them into becoming radical progressives.

UgxGyir49s2fVo-CeN54AaABAg.91ZwviVpBFI91iBftQlwy1		1	2019-11-24 10:37:08	Iwer Sonsch	From what I've read, there seems to be a bit more simplification here on how the greenhouse effect actually works (source: Gary Novak, http://nov79.com/gbwm/ntyg.html ): When an air molecule absorbs a photon, it doesn't straight up emit it back in a random direction. Instead, it stores the energy as heat in the air, transports and distributes it over many air molecules, and gradually the energy from the heat gets emitted by black body radiation from those molecules. Adding more greenhouse gases lowers the probability that this black body radiation makes it to space - the main way for the Earth to actually get rid of heat. Novak points out that most of the heat transfers are of a nanokinetic nature, but those still keep the energy inside the Earth-atmosphere-system. For many wavelengths, this probability is near zero anyway if the photon was emitted by the Earth's surface. However, and this seems to be what Novak missed: Where the black body radiation is coming from the atmosphere itself, the higher you go, the more energy the current concentration of greenhouse gases is leaving to escape. It seems to be on those highest few percents of the atmosphere that most of the black body radiation actually escapes. Adding more greenhouse gases increases the chances that Radiation will be absorbed even that high, causing less radiation overall to escape. The warmer the earth and the atmosphere get, the more energy is emitted back by black body radiation. This causes the temperature of planets to not just linearly rise or fall indefinitely. The effect as it stands isn't that big, indirectly warming earth from ~255K to ~288K. Adding more CO2 compared to the pre-industrial 280 ppm is projected to increase this effect by up to another Kelvin directly, with another 1-4 Kelvin from indirect effects like melting white surfaces and an increased capacity of warmer ocean air for the greenhouse gas water vapor. How can I conclude from probabilities to practice? Well, the number of molecules and photons in this consideration is way over 10^20, so the expected statistical deviation from the theoretical effects is very small. You might as well treat fingerprint absorption as deterministic at this scale, with the distribution still being calculated via stochastics.

Black Body Radiation from the Earth and the Earth's atmosphere is pretty much all infrared of low frequencies, and a big percentage of that is inside the absorption specrta of CO2, H2O and alike.

Ever since I started watching your videos I do nothing else but think about them, study them, recommend them to others and put them into practice. I am aware you will be doing the next valuetainment conference down here in Florida and I will most definitely attend, man I get butterflies just thinking I will meet you in person. Anyhow, I have a question and video request for you. I am a 23 year old currently in the banking industry working 9-5 for Wells Fargo, but I also started doing some Real Estate flipping and investing on the side this year. So far I have made many mistakes, I have lost money, and I have lost friends/partners after the eye opening experiences this first year into business has put my way. But Pat my main question is the following. I always hear how much you emphasize on the importance of building a great network of influence with people that are leves above you. I try to do this by networking with wealthy and interesting clients that I see on a daily basis and with many of them I have built a pretty close and good relationship. But how do I keep in touch with these individuals ? How often do I reach out to say hello ? How do I make it seem like I truly want to build a relationship and not just absorb information or benefit from their expertise ? I have made contacts from many industries, but it has only gotten to the point of having their phone number on my contact list. How do I follow up ? Do I call them ? Do I send a Christmas card once a year ? Do I send an email ? Do I invite to coffee ? I am just very curious on what you have to say about this. As I had mentioned I am 23 years old, and sometimes it is very hard for me due to the age to catch these peoples attention to then let them vanish with time and forget my name. Please make a video about this as I am sure many others will also benefit. Thank you once again for everything you do ! <br /><br />- Jose T.

Post-industrial, we're increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration artificially and the extra CO2 is having a heating effect. We've changed the game from what happened in the past. Regards CO2 being a trace gas; Only about 1% of the atmosphere traps heat. So right there you could discard most of your imaginary stadium as being besides the point. This trapping of energy gives us an average temp of ~59˚F, which allows for life to exist (if it didn't, the globe would be encased in solid ice) Water vapor accounts for about 50% of the greenhouse effect, clouds account for 25%, CO2 accounts for about 20% - which is a not inconsiderable chunk. The rest is caused by aerosols and minor greenhouse gases like methane (and let's hope methane remains a minor gas). Water vapor is the major player in that 1%, but it does not trap all infrared energy and is concentrated mostly in the lower atmosphere. CO2 however, mixes well up to about 50km. Water vapor concentration is also highly variable under the influence of temperature - e.g. it rains out easily - while CO2 molecules can hang around in the atmosphere for decades, perhaps even centuries before being naturally sequestered in sediment, the oceans or living creatures. I mention all this to highlight how woefully inadequate is your simplistic 'people heating a stadium' example. Your example also doesn't seem to take into account the cumulative effect of decades of emissions. To be clear, we're on our way to doubling atmospheric CO2 from pre-industrial levels. And because we are increasing the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere by continuing to burn fossil fuels -even in relatively small amounts compared to the entire mass of the atmosphere - we are disturbing the entire heat balance of the planet.

Not the other way around. And as to the effect of CO2 in our atmosphere, it only makes up 4 tenths of one percent. That number is easily found. It is so small it is considered a trace gas. And how much of all the CO2 in the atmosphere is from burning fossil fuels? That is much more difficult to find, but if you dig through enough research, you will discover it also is approximately 4 tenths of one percent. So the amount man is contributing by burning fossil fuels makes the total amount as a percentage of the atmosphere so minute as to be considered an insignificant contributing factor. So in a stadium that holds 10,000 people, 4 people enter (avg weight 180 lbs). Percentage wise, those 4 people represent CO2. Technically the temperature of the stadium will rise if it is below the temperature of those people. But not in any significant matter. Add a small cat (about 7 pounds) that represents the amount of CO2 created by burning fossil fuels. That has even less significance. Just looking at the numbers using relatively simple math overwhelmingly suggests man is having an insignificant effect on global climate.

Lets stick to sum facts shall we bitch? Banks are psychopaths. Period. No, I didn't come up with the idea, a Nobel prize winning economist did ( refer the book the "The Corporation"). In fact most corporations are psychopaths. If you apply the psych test for psychopaths to most corporations, the corporations test positive. Period. So no, banks don't care about borrowers or deposit holders. Banks have only one legal obligation and that is to make money for shareholders. Banks have been sued successfully for tax evasion, money laundering, overlending, overcharging, lying, stealing, market fixing etc etc etc. So, banks have committed huge overlending in the past (GFC) and the present (global warming). And please, get the distinction between lender and borrower correct. Your statement "I would never borrow a freeloader like Alex a dime." is nonsensical. There again, nothing you said made sense!

Under strict quality control guidelines, all our instrumentation was calibrated daily and checked against primary standards. "We never based any result on dodgy computer modelling nor words like we expect, we believe, it is envisaged, or we predict...." With our very reputation as a NATA certified lab, we could never give clients results we couldnt repeat or justify. So I have asked this question many times albeit in vain, but please is there any climate change advocate, evangelist, ER teenage puppet or "expert" reading this? If you genuinely make a claim like "I believe the science is in" the burden of proof lies with you So describe an actual study that uses real scientific data, that proves beyond a reasonable doubt, that fossil fuels meager 3% contribution to the 0.04% of atmospheric CO2 is 1) responsible for climate change 2) that such change is something new or unexpected in earth's long climate history 3) how you moved from correlation to causation ruling out about a dozen other unpredictable parameters that can drastically influence climate? *Hint:* numerous greenhouse experiments have been performed that produce data that *prove beyond any doubt,* that increasing CO2 by 200-400 ppm have significantly improved plant yields by upto 200%. See CO2science.org I suspect that is the reason why carbon-based lifeforms like us thrive and multiply, right?

Maybe I pointed out that they're less unviable to make than weather predictions because the parameters to predict are more averaged out over a larger area and time period. You definitely did claim man's contribution to climate change as "impossible to factcheck", though. That is a bold statement, considering we can "factcheck" scientific fields of research like evolution, where any data from present measurements has to be interpreted with sufficient insight to gain reliable information about the past and about some persistent properties of the universe.

I'm sorry that this has to be as complicated as it is. 1:16 Correct. 1:39 Even if CO2 was the only cause for global warming (which it isn't), this would only be correct for the first initiation of the trend. Warming also causes the ocean to emit more CO2, which reinforces any warming from CO2 emissions further. 2:06 Correct for the pre-human eras, where the CO2 concentration didn't change any more rapidly than the other factors relevant for the global temperature. 2:22 This is only surprising if you actually believed that CO2 was the only factor ever mattering for the global temperature. I don't think many adult alarmists actually think that. 2:34 Yes, this is because warmer oceans can contain less CO2, and cooler oceans contain more, causing the opposite effect on the concentration in the atmosphere. 3:08 I request evidence that any scientist actually ever claimed the shifted graph. The rest is more of the same. Just reiterating that this one naive idea of a one-way and exclusive causation between CO2 and the temperature is not true. I.e. something every adult alarmist should agree on and have no problem incorporating into their world view.

Regards not reading scientific journals, I freely admit, I'm a layperson and so I rely on summaries the scientific community put out for the general public. I don't think that's an unreasonable approach. In fact I think there's a danger of untrained amateurs over-estimating their expertise in interpreting the scientific literature. You see it quite often in that they develop oddball personal theories that typically take a very narrow focus on one or two factors only. They then decry that they've found the special key that 'DESTROYS GLOBAL WARMING!'. Except they haven't and ten minutes discussion with someone actually trained in the field would show them where they're going wrong. In fact, is there a University nearby with a climate studies dept you could talk with? It would probably be quite useful to you. But again, Dr. Natalie Krivova - the scientific advisor to the PhD program you linked to yourself a few comments ago - stated 'There is evidence that sunlight on earth has increased by around one watt over the past 300 to 400 years. “However, we cannot rule out a decrease in sunlight in the next few decades, and we must not trivialize the fact that greenhouse gases have contributed significantly more to global warming than the sun has.” https://www.photonworld.de/nc/en/magazine/featurearticle/die-sonne/fseite/3.html BTW: 'roughly 10 degrees inside of 50-75 as telling of greenland ice core data' Not sure what you're arguing here - can you explain your shorthand further?

Yes some of them are retired, but that doesn't mean less credibility. Also there was pointed out, it's peer reviewed, aswell. They also talk in some of the presentations as children was the audience, which I didn't care for, either. But the matter is, that the models do not correlate with experiment. To me, that is wrong, and if it is wrong, it's all just 'guess the next parameter' or whatever. Some models are probably right in a sense that their parameters are more correct and so give better predictions. But, if there's some, that give negative correlations and some neutral regarding Co2, I'm not convinced they work.

Instead, it stores the energy as heat in the air, transports and distributes it over many air molecules, and gradually the energy from the heat gets emitted by black body radiation from those molecules. Adding more greenhouse gases lowers the probability that this black body radiation makes it to space - the main way for the Earth to actually get rid of heat. Novak points out that most of the heat transfers are of a nanokinetic nature, but those still keep the energy inside the Earth-atmosphere-system. For many wavelengths, this probability is near zero anyway if the photon was emitted by the Earth's surface. However, and this seems to be what Novak missed: Where the black body radiation is coming from the atmosphere itself, the higher you go, the more energy the current concentration of greenhouse gases is leaving to escape. It seems to be on those highest few percents of the atmosphere that most of the black body radiation actually escapes. Adding more greenhouse gases increases the chances that Radiation will be absorbed even that high, causing less radiation overall to escape. The warmer the earth and the atmosphere get, the more energy is emitted back by black body radiation. This causes the temperature of planets to not just linearly rise or fall indefinitely. The effect as it stands isn't that big, indirectly warming earth from ~255K to ~288K. Adding more CO2 compared to the pre-industrial 280 ppm is projected to increase this effect by up to another Kelvin directly, with another 1-4 Kelvin from indirect effects like melting white surfaces and an increased capacity of warmer ocean air for the greenhouse gas water vapor. How can I conclude from probabilities to practice? Well, the number of molecules and photons in this consideration is way over 10^20, so the expected statistical deviation from the theoretical effects is very small. You might as well treat fingerprint absorption as deterministic at this scale, with the distribution still being calculated via stochastics.

The experiments suggesting that they do are based on models of the make-up of the atmosphere created well over 100 years ago and little altered since. A cyclic change, based on a combination of proximity to the sun, the changing nature of the sun and atmospheric pressure seems more likely.

Would you say that your understanding of it is good enough to dismiss scientists who dedicate their lives to studying it? I'm not going to go into specific details as to why 1 degree matters but we can use general logic here too. You're saying pictures of ice skating is some kind of proof? There's some good arguments made by deniers but im afraid pictures of weather in specific areas at specific times is extremely poor evidence. Now you're talking about volcanoes, I don't really know much about them. The crucial thing here, which I have to point out, is you keep conflating _weather_ with _climate_ . They are vastly different concepts. Good luck on the path though, I hope you're right.

You're not dealing with absolute temperature in particular area, you're dealing with global average. The climate is incredibly complex and sensitive to changes. There's alot of really interesting papers on this. Its to much to explain via youtube comment. I do agree with you about pollution and planting more trees, but just not the 1 degree thing. Also note that its 1 degree in a relatively short amount of time and correlating to a huge acceleration of CO2 levels.

And I've already done my homework. 1° is not that big of deal. Sunspots are in correlation and volcanoes spew way more in eatch eruption than mankind has in 200 years. However I do think we need to reseed the planet with more trees. There is a way to bring life back to this planet even the desert. But as stated before 1° difference is nothing compared to 30° difference in one day. Its overhype. Do I believe we need to watch what crap comes out of our tail pipe .... yes. Is solar and wind an answer.... I dont think so. Maybe nuclear power plants are a key component in reduction of emissions but fossil fuels will be here a long time.

Prince Charles said we only had 3 years until the end, he said that 4 years ago.<br />The Rothschilds: Royal Dutch Shell(among others), worked hand in hand with the Rockefellers promoting the UN&#39;s agenda, key to creating the IPCC. <br />There are many, many more individuals with ties to Big Oil and this so called environmental movement. <br /><br />The worlds largest oil companies(see Cartel) worked together to fund and create organizations like the IPCC and others like it that push the AGW agenda. <br /><br />The argument— that oil companies(the ones that matter, big oil) are fighting against those that are putting forward the &quot;man made global warming&quot; narrative and the &quot;science&quot; behind it—is FALSE!!<br />They created the &quot;problem&quot;, they anticipate our &quot;reaction&quot;, and they offer the &quot;solution&quot;. <br />If they really cared about the planet they&#39;d have done something about Fukushima.

I&#39;ve been through many things in my business life and one thing that is extremely clear in my mind , there is no doubt in my mind , there is no left or right side in it , is that the Climate change is real ! As you know.. south-eastern Europe is famous with its winter season , let me tell you this , just one small example ... when I was 10 years old , we had 1 meter of snow on the streets every single winter , starting somewhere mid of October and ends in end of March or mid April ... today , literally today , my son , whos 4 years of age asked me - where is the snow ?! We are 20th of November 2019 now and we have no snow , you probably cannot imagine what that means because you dont live here but for us , for me , this is crazy , every year it is getting worst , of course there are some winters in the past 20 years (2012 last!) that were very hard but they become a rarity ...that is only one simple example , I can talk with hours about it ...otherwise , thanks for this one mate !

That's caused by changes in Atlantic ocean circulation, well mostly it is. Some tenths of degrees is due to global warming, but you can't really feel that. It's already well known phenomena. It's cyclical and repeats once or twice every century. 1930's and 1940's had mild winters. Look up Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, if you are interested. The problem is that every change, even temporary local ones, are now used to push the agenda regardless of whether there is any truth to it or not. Often there isn't because the changes happen so slowly. It can't be easily dramatized, so they take large natural variabilties, even changes in weather, and push it as climate change.

It was a full 1 degree warmer over a 5 year period then (1918 to 1923) then it is now (2013 to 2018). It wasn&#39;t easy but the data is out there go out and figure out for yourself.

The powers that be have been demonizing and ruining careers of experts who go against the narrative of Global warming. It&#39;s time for both sides of the debate to be allowed in the public square.<br />Another question to ask is, if the data is so convincing for Anthropomorphic Global warming, why has NASA been manipulating historical data in an attempt to enhance this effect? Why do the AGW alarmists cherry pick the data using very short periods of time instead of longer term data? Watch the Tony Heller youtube videos. He shows how NASA has been changing the data from the past. How do we know? We have the data from the past, we even have past presentations where NASA showed the data accurately, and now we have their current presentations with the data modified. Also ask why all the computer models for climate change have been wrong, and over estimated the changes in warming.. There are many more questions to ask once you dig into this. Climate change is a political football created for greed(increasing taxes), and control(attempts at globalization of government).<br /><br />Another thing to consider is that the effects of Co2 on climate change are not conclusive. The long term history chart that Al Gore used in his movie, and anyone can look it up actually shows the Co2 levels &#39;lagging&#39; the temperature changing cycles. One thing that we know to be scientifically accurate is that a higher level of Co2 causes all the plants on earth to grow faster. This is actually not only a benefit to human kind, it&#39;s the way Co2 is regulated on the planet. As far as being a greenhouse gas, even if that were true it&#39;s a tiny percentage of the greenhouse gas on earth. The largest is water vapor which will vary, and is also regulating because it&#39;s a well known fact that clouds cause more cooling by reflecting sun rays back into space and also blocking the sun from heating up the surface. <br />I won&#39;t even get into how the panic not many decades ago was &#39;global cooling&#39;.. there was a panic that the earths temperatures were falling which would take us back to ice age. I think people need to calm down.	UCS_Iug5F5au7RrLuSnzw5ig	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS_Iug5F5au7RrLuSnzw5ig	0

Second, What about our health? Are we actually supposed to breath in polluted air? Or drink polluted water? And in last i would say that i find global warming or climate change to be the last reason to stop humans from polluting environment and start caring for nature.

Presenting 2 sides of history is essential to teaching historical events and their potential causes, and kudos to your teachers for doing that. Again, however, this is NOT history. Scientific curriculums are made by representing the current understanding and scientific studies found in the scientific literature. There are no two sides in scientific discourse, just scientists attempting to disprove each other, reinforce studies by repeating experiments, or scientists experimenting fields that are still unclear to scientific Enterprise.

I just mean that schools should be teaching to look at facts on both sides of an issue instead of teaching with one particular agenda/political leaning or another. In high school, my 2 IB history teachers taught that way. They gave us a pretty accurate representation of both sides of an issue without showing much bias one way or another. Because they were so excellent at clearly explaining "traditionally conservative" points of views, I assumed they were Republican/conservative. Turns out, my best friend privately found out that they were Democrats. LOL! Can't imagine many teachers nowadays upholding their professional integrity the way my teachers did.

This has almost nothing to do with the environmental policy anymore, with problems such as deforestation or the ozone hole said Edenhofer, who co-chaired the U.N.?s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change working group on Mitigation of Climate Change from 2008 to 2015. <br />So, what is the goal of environmental policy? <br />We redistribute de facto the worlds wealth by climate policy,? said Edenhofer.For those who want to believe that maybe Edenhofer just misspoke and doesn’t really mean that, consider that a little more than five years ago he also said that ?the next world climate summit in Cancun is actually an economy summit during which the distribution of the worlds resources will be negotiated. Mad as they are, Edenhofers comments are nevertheless consistent with other alarmists who have spilled the movements dirty secret.

As i pointed out to you i am glad you take interest in survival skills military or otherwise. That is condescending??? How? I'm glad you like Les but don't let that fool you into thinking it will help you very much in a given situation. Les get's dropped into the wild which is not likely for most people to happen. It's a Tv show. Most folks depend on shops and supermarkets etc. They live in cities where survival is a whole different ballgame. What will they do when those are failing? They definitely won't all be going into the Canadian nature and copying Les Stroud. They will have to survive in their own urban environment. You seem to know very little about that and have romantic ideas about living in nature. If that works for you then hey...more power to you but that is not the situation for most industrial folks. Survival for any being means food-water-shelter. I does not mean for people to be a bushcraft expert but adapting well to their own environment.

That's what people with no content do on social media and it does not grace you dude. And you are way off, of course. Yes rice culture releases methane mostly which is of course a greenhouse gas. And that started around 8,000 years ago indeed. You can find Prof. Emanuel's videos about that if you care to check. which i doubt. Do your wood products build the shelter i reside in? No i live in a brick house. There is some wood in the windowsills but it sure as hell did not come from your business. I'm glad to hear you have some interest in survival skills but i wouldn't rate the military training too highly. There is general knowledge in those courses but it is designed for short term survival and escape so troops can rejoin, not for long term living so much. Sure you can learn a bit about foraging, signalling, escape and evasion and so on and take useful information from that but it is not focused on survival principally. It is focused on warfare. Guys like Bear Grylls being the prime example of course....always on the run...must escape this place where a helicopter dropped me in the middle of nowhere within a week or i am toast....but i used to be in the SAS so i can do it! I studied survival for maybe 10 years in the urban setting and that is very different. It's what most people have to deal with in a collapse scenario. I'll give you an example if you please that i often give others; Most preppers and survivalists here in The Netherlands have romantic ideas of going out hunting deer or pigs in the very few nature areas left...how stupid. I can grab a bunch of sheep, geese and many other animals pretty much right next to my house. As well as veggies, fruit and so on....it's easy and effective. Do you see what i just did there??? It wasn't competition but i gave you tips. Please be so polite to leave out the personal insults allright and try to be factual.

Climate science uses a pre-industrial baseline for good reason. Not a pre-anthropos baseline. That would include early humans and all who had no effect on climate. Earliest effects on climate by human activity date back around 8 or 9 housand years ago only with the arrival of agriculture such as rice culture and deforestation. But that was still very insignificant compared to industrial influence on climate...hence the pre-industrial baseline. Pointing at me being part of that system is a pretty meaningless statement. People have no choice what they are born into after all. I'll compare my footprint with yours gladly...pretty sure you won't come out with the smallest though....

I enjoy your videos very much. <br /><br /><br />Only issue I have is that climate change IS happening. There are decades of satellite data, two centuries of meticulous ground temperature data and thousands of years of ice core data which tells a much grander story of our climate that is pretty conclusive. The cyclical argument is pretty mute because the RATE OF CHANGE is nothing like we have seen in the past using ice cores going back thousands of years. Also whether its cyclical or not, the change is still happening which is aided by anthropogenic carbon emissions into the atmosphere. Yes, minor oscillations in yearly temperature patters will occur, however the trend is on a clear upward trajectory. <br /><br /><br />Forget Al Gore and all the &quot;government&quot; scientists some of your follower love to distrust. Data and mathematics do not lie.<br /><br /><br />There is no debate. People who do not understand climate science, debate, people who can discern scientific data and can think critically, quickly come to the conclusion that climate change is REAL. It seems Americans and some Canadians and Aussies are the only ones who are debating climate change while the lands are burning, tides are progressing inshore further than ever, storms are stronger and overall the volume of precipitation is increasing. This is all tied together people. Debating about it is just a distraction by people who do not know what the heck they are talking about.

I would only invite Catastrophic Global Warming scientists who advocate for nuclear power as the only serious thinkers who don&#39;t want to disrupt the global economy.<br /><br />Three questions I would ask the catastrophic crowd: how would you explain the Simon-Erlich wager? Why have scientists advocated for more government funding and/or redistribution as a solution to global warming? What is the Popper falsifiable hypothesis for catastrophic global warming -- something that if it were wrong, you would admit your whole premise is wrong and would apologize for the hundreds of billions wasted suckling up to the gub&#39;ment teat ?

It’s undeniable; just look outside your window. Our economic system requires infinite growth on a planet with finite resources, and EVERYTHING, from our economy to our lives, is dependent on the environment. Until mankind breaks through from this matrix and is able to see our true connection with nature, and until we can develop a sane monetary system which takes resources into account and not just “economic growth”, we are doomed. Maybe technology can get us out of it, but it all starts with the mindset. I find that all of this arguing and confusion gets us absolutely no where and only stalls our path to enlightenment.

Elon because of his industrial background and involvment in energy shift, rising contribution to using electricity (Tesla Motors) and, ironicly, fossil fuels (SpaceX). He is also experienced in testing assumptions which is important in thinking about large (earth) scale problems Both of them seem to have an outstanding ability to comunicate complex topics in simple words and ask right questions. <br />A thing that would destinguish Patrick&#39;s conversation on climate change from other debates would be performing simple basic chemical and phisical experiments.

Also all the people fear mongering that we’ll be under 40 feet of water like Obama are buying multi million dollar beachfront homes.<br /><br />NASA altered their data to suit the climate alarmist agenda. Canada just threw out 100 years of climate Data.<br /><br />As for Venice, check out 500 year old paintings during the flooding season, exactly the same as it is now.<br /><br />It was hotter 2000 years ago during Ronan times, and the medieval times. And the 30s were the hottest decade since records began.<br /><br /><br />Now for the greenhouse effect. The simulation they used to model the greenhouse effect had no sun! The green house heated itself on cycle. That is not a world we live in. <br /><br />So yes it’s a huge fuckjng scam to tax people.

Ice melting from glaciers or off of the continent of Antarctica will increase sea levels, as well as dilute the salt in the ocean, which will lower its density. Also, a warmer ocean will expand, and a fractional expansion of a body of water that large will be dangerous.

Would you go to your state senator or your local bank for a second opinion if your doctor told you you had cancer? No, because that would be absurd. Framing climate change as a “two sided” issue is absurd. I highly recommend reading through what the science says about the most used climate myths at <a href="http://skepticalscience.com/">skepticalscience.com</a>.

I do not know any scientist who disagres with this. The IPCC has no real authority in this discussion as they are a beaurocratic body, not a scientific body. The Charter of the IPCC is all about man made Gobal warming - and they are not allowed to consider natural changes and everything MUST be attributed to man - this is in their charter.

We just disagree with the statement that it&#39;s worth destroying the world economy over it. Is the last 100 years the average temp has risen by around 1 degree and the average human life expectancy doubled. That&#39;s a good trade to me. Not to mention there&#39;s a net greening and net reforestation worldwide. The forests are returning, the whales are coming back, the overall agricultural yield has increased and is more water efficient (carbon dioxide is a natural fertilizer, the only reason plants evaporate water is to trap carbon from the air in return).

I didn't say the life expectancy doubled because of one extra degree in temperature. That is ridiculous, especially if that's what you understood. I meant that in the last 100 years of using fossil fuels their impact humanity and the cheap energy that they brought us caused life expectancy to double. And the trade-off has only being one degree in temperature increase. also the only reason why we have ice in Earth is because we are leaving an ice age. For most of its history the Earth was a lot warmer and humid than now.	UCsNKZ1vTu7nFtBTY9lhib8w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsNKZ1vTu7nFtBTY9lhib8w	1	UgyJVNzh-YiENQNDna54AaABAg	walkintothefuture

Since the discovery of fossil fuels it has more than doubled. There is no correlation only pure causation. If not oil what made it double? Hippie philosophies like yours? I'm not saying we shouldn't move into green and renewable energy but that's is a transition that the free market should decide. We stopped using whale oil when fossil fuels became cheaper. Did renewable technologies have a long way to go before they are cheaper than fossil fuels. Also why do you have to offend? Are you incapable of having a rational conversation like a human being? Classical leftist behavior, "if you don't agree with me you are my enemy and I have to offend you."

I am also aware of the cycles, and those shorter than 100 000 years. I have been made aware of the fact that a grand solar minimum brings about a stiff 20 degree drop average globally due over the next century. We are being mislead and confused by mislead and confused people. We forget Why Africans and other people of the world worshiped The Sun. I have a feeling that we will soon be harshly reminded.

We maybe responsible for only a small amount added each year, but we do it constantly and it adds up, and we also keep increasing the amount we release every year. Natural cycles and changes are a part of the picture, but so are we. Grand solar minimum is predicted to happen, but it's likely to be lot less than you predict and last maybe a few decades. We'll probably see a leveling off rather than a considerable cooling. Nonetheless, it'll be interesting to see where it leads.

He was always banging on about the coming ice-age or "global cooling" because of man's influence. Then in the 80's he had me terrified of acid rain. He said that the building where we lived would start eroding away and collapse because they were made of limestone and that it would get so bad that it would burn our skin to go out in the rain. I'm the 90s he was all about the ozone layer. He told me I would get cancer from staying out in the sun more than 5 minutes and thats when he started saying the earth was "warming" not "cooling". In the 00's he was all about "climate change". Not cooling, not warming, just "changing". He watched Al Gore's movie and he wanted to sell his home (which was on the coast) and buy somewhere inland. He became a total profit of doom. He passed away 2 years ago having spent most of his adult life terrified of impending climate destruction and having made me terrified of it for most of my childhood. Naturally, I've done a lot of research on the topic as a consequence and the truth makes me angry. The truth that for over 70 years this climate histeria hoax has been perpetrated on ordinary people who don't know any better. Its disgusting, and I hope enough people wake up to the truth of this lie to see justice done to those that peddle it.

Late Springs and early Falls for 3 years now. 30% canola crop still in fields. 45% of sugar beets, still in fields under snow. Northern Alberta is a disaster. Bad news with the same in Ontario (propane crisis). Same in Sweden and Russia for 3 years and this year, Spring arrived late by about 30 days in Greece. That's on the Mediterranean folks. Kenya, wetter than normal year-end this year. It's global warming alright. I just remember 65 years ago with the weather we experienced then. Looks a lot like now. Hmm!!!! My Dad lived through the 1930s in Alberta. Now that was hot and dry. We're not even remotely close to what it was like then. How soon we forget history, and data. Governments have prepared us using a false narrative. When we are hit by the cold, as we were this year and previously, and we begin to suffer severe food shortages and energy shortages (energy poverty), we need to sue the government for negligence and fraud. When alarmists wake up in 12 years, and discover things are a lot different than they predicted, what are they going to do and say? My prediction - they will find something else to blame.

You forgot that co2 is a trace gas in the atmosphere at 0.04%.<br /><br />IPCC has even said this and I quote. <br />&quot;The impact of Climate change will be small relative to the impact of other drivers&quot;<br /><br />And the earth&#39;s cloud cover has diminished causing a temperature increase. <br /><br />And the heat increase in the 90&#39;s was a normalization and with a slight increase above normal caused of el Nino effect. The 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s was unusually cold. <br /><br />And the water lvl increase is linearly since the last ice age and has nothing to do with climate change. <br /><br />And venice flooding is a regular occurence since venice is sinking..... it&#39;s a cheap media trick to get people to buy into the climate change.<br /><br />I don&#39;t say humans dont affect the climate we do but not to the extent Ipcc wants u to believe. <br />Look at climate change just from a money and job perspective and u will find that it&#39;s a way to tax people and make more money it&#39;s all about the economy nothing else. <br /><br />We need to pollute less and take care of the earth but doing it by scaring people into submission is wrong and dishonest tactic. <br /><br />Btw why u think IPCC needs over 100 climate models if they are so sure and right? <br /><br />U should really look into the claim 99% of scientists agree climate change is real. <br />If I did math like that I would be belted by a math teacher. It&#39;s a dishonest way to get the number they wanted.<br /><br />And right now the sun is at its lowest activity and the solar wind is very weak letting more space particles into out atmosphere causing the temp to go up and when the sun picks up again the solar wind will push those particles away again.

It pumps air. <br />Air comes in from one side and goes out the other.<br />#3 we add a drop of HC (gasoline) into the air(O2) it&#39;s compressed we add spark and like magic we turn the O2 and HC into H2O, and CO2.<br />#4 I&#39;m sure we can reverse the process. <br />#5 just remember the basics, these are molecules and Atoms, they don&#39;t disappear into thin air, and you cannot erase them.

Now like he said how much change do we have in the entire spectrum idk I&#39;d have to look it up. But what I do know is that as a whole modern humans have been around co2 levels have increased dramatically and there are several researches proving that we have increased global climate by 1.3 degrees in 50 years and projected to hit 3 degrees in 12 years that&#39;s where the 12 years thing came from. As we use more co2 type energy it increases the speed we raise the global climate. And yes 3 degrees ain&#39;t much for us living in a 4 season climate but 3 degrees in a naturally balanced climate where a slight change will change the entire ecosystem and environment in that area places like Antarctica. So what will happen is we lose Antarctica changing ocean temperatures and sea raising. And the current ocean currents that effect how fishing, weather that where use to predicting using currents and clouds will become unpredictable. So thats for sure will happen that I know of sea levels raising, temperature rising in delicate ecosystems that will cause losing alot of animal life as well as currents changing which effect natural disasters like hurricanes notice how we&#39;ve been having hurricane after hurricane	UChnIIeJGKkE2G4kX7uGbxRQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UChnIIeJGKkE2G4kX7uGbxRQ	0

Big example is planet Venus where you can actually see the green house effect in all the ‘’beauty’’.<br />We can surely say climate is changing naturally all over the world and it always was like that.<br />Soil Stratigraphy is a method scientists use to see how different places in the world where different in climate years and years ago and so we can see it is quiet naturaly, but we are playing a big role in this. Making it all go faster and faster and im not the right person to say in % how bad it is because of us, but in my opinion we are a bigger problem then most of us think and we are making it lot of worst. Therefore we should make a big changes and be more helpful to the nature. We are the ones who are able to do something.

Nothing ever is a monolith really and I should have pointed out that I was speaking in a general sense for western academia. I would have gotten back to you sooner, but I've been ill. Feeling under the weather and all that. Not sure if I caught a bug or what, but now someone else in my house hold is starting to feel crappy. Some examples I would point to would be the numerous debates that the establishment won't show up for. Ones such as the Jhon Stossel debate I already pointed to. There are even debates on intelligent design theory which main stream academics have been shown not only to try to silence opposition, but threaten their jobs. Tell me, are such tactics generally used by those who know they are right? Do you see people who are firm in their beliefs trying to suppress knowledge of the opposition? This isn't the type of behavior typical of people or organizations which don't authentically feel threatened. As far as the hypothetical "no man made climate change" idea, I think it should be given time to correctly figure out what we should do. When we jump into things to fast we get the risk of long lasting negatives which impact generations of people. Things which sound good, like welfare can become burdensome when its over done and even will negatively effect those who fall under its policies. I'm more about finding a balance in all these topics. The more and more I look at different topics, I see humans tend to go to extremes. There is usually a tipping point involved, which can be measured in almost anything we do to find the right amount of influence a individual or group should have on it to reap the best rewards. Unfortunately, again people tend to go to extremes. With this they go to far one way or another. They have a decent idea, but then blow it out of the water making things worse than when they implemented the idea. Sorry if I came off rude or upset. I wasn't able to think to clearly for the past couple of days due to sickness. I do try my best, but I am only a human after all. Thanks for the comment and good luck to you and yours.

I also find Kind of odd to see academia as a monolith. Because other seats of academia all around the world are very different from each other. This also doesn't take up the notion that the fields themselves are very different. To me it seems that you don't really have been sceptical about climatology, more that you put every academic study in one camp. When they all have the interned situation. Also do you have an example of what you mean when you are referring to academia to be religious authoritarian? I mean if you want to take one of the most conservative consensus, the question of climate change. You can just read ipcc climate report. And if you don't trust it, you can look up the sources. That lead you to the specific scientist there are all over the world. If you catch yourself not feeling that you actually understand, then it's time to study some more. If you don't want to That, you Should consider trust people That dedicate their life to it, or you become one yourself. Which maybe isn't feasible. Then maybe the best is to leave the topic altogether. Because I going to be honest it seems to me that you don't really understand the topic That well. Maybe I'm wrong but that's the impression I'm getting. No ill will against you. Another thing that is interesting to think about, hypothetical there is no man-made climate change, and it's all caused by natural effects. Should we even then try to mitigate it. Even if it only gives us a micro-present, of better odds? Good luck with everything I guess.

Heard about it on a dozen different YouTube channels. As I have said in other comments I honestly have only a surface level knowledge in the field itself. My beef isn't with my own understanding. Its about the system we are supposed to trust in. Academics aren't acting at all as they should. Very authoritarian. Science is about asking questions. When Academia ridicules, attacks and gives its challengers the silent treatment we have a problem. There are dozens of other problems with Academia right now, but the core among them is this religious authoritarian push for not questioning the establishment. Do we live in Communist China? Why are they acting this way if they have sound arguments? Their character speaks volumes. As the saying has been said "actions speak louder than words."

Because I would argue the best way you can go about it. is to read a surface level into the field itself so, you understand the phenomenon that they are Spoken of. Example just read some Wikipedia articles about climatology, and when you have done that, you can see if ,you want to, do a deep dive. Put away, a one week to read a lot. When you have come over the threshold, that is usually called the Dunning Kruger effect. One usually come to the realisation how complex the field or topic is come to understand that one doesn't have the capability of setting themselves into Every topic, and that's when you start to look to what experts are Saying of the topics ,And the consensus of the field itself.

From what I have seen is it is the other way around. Those in mainstream academia are so afraid to question what is "the norm" that they will berate and try to get fired anyone who challenges their concepts. Is such behavior that of someone who really believes in the facts? Giving colleges the cold shoulder and silent treatment because they happen to be questioning things as they see problems with them. Read the description of the silent treatment I put at the end of my I believe 2nd response. I generally don't think those in charge want answers. I believe there are those who have found answers considered problematic and have been unjustly shut out for it. You can't call yourself a man or woman of science, if your first priority isn't to ask questions. There are far to many people who put their full trust in authority. To the point it being burdensome and deadly. These people are the sheep of the world and like sheep they straight up will be fleeced and put in their pens to be continually exploited. It doesn't matter which system is put in place. A degree of exploitation will always happen. The question is would you rather be a stuck in a cage, relegated to never seeing the outdoors or nature or would you rather be permitted to at least be able to go outside and roam around in your fenced in area?

It makes it easier and thus more enjoyable to read when it is decently spaced. My rule of thumb is every 3 sentences make it a paragraph so people who are reading it don't have to read through a super long column of words. I'm going to be honest and say I haven't looked super hard into either side. More or less from a surface level I would reason to a degree those in charge are hurting the earth. To what degree though, I'm uncertain. I have heard both arguments, again from a surface level and what I hear does make me think a portion of this is out of our control and is part of the earths natural cycles. Then there is the "CO2 is bad and killing the earth" argument I keep hearing, but doesn't it mean it will end up helping plants grow faster? Why not plant more plants in response to the growing CO2? (like the 20 million tree thing) The last bit of text you sent has me a bit confused. "that doesn’t start with is mankind causing it and how fast will temperatures rise and what effect would that have on the biosphere. If we can agree on that then we can debate what to do about it." A bit of rephrasing may help me here. I think your saying you want to focus on "is mankind causing it." Its just the way its worded reads weird. Or are you saying if we can't agree on mankind caused it you wouldn't want to go further? Either way, like I said earlier, I do think those in charge have had some cause into it. I just don't know how much. I'm not fully convinced its 100% mankind's fault either. If we want to look at those who are the biggest pollutants we can't forget China and India. Yet, it seems as though they aren't even in the conversation to begin with. There may be a brief mention, but then its "US you need to do better," even though the US has been doing better historically. Did you give me your answer as to being able to trust people who use the silent treatment as a answer for debate? All I seen was "I can mind read their motives and come up with valid reasons why they could avoid that venue and still act in good faith." And "I suppose the real question for thinking people is what do you make, from your own research, of the evidence and arguments out there?" seemed more like deflection of my actual question. I would think people would be more open to actual conversation on these types of topics, but since a portion of people have become authoritarian in their belief system. It looks like the very fabric of asking questions (which is a scientists job) is frankly, out of the question. I'm going to ask you straight up right now, do you believe in using the silent treatment?

Nuclear energy is an example, i would also imagine fusion since many scientists have been tirelessly researching it for the past 50 years and can change the energy industry forever, considering our technology and intelligent people living today would not be surprised if it came into reality in 50 years, so whats the rush? do your research everyone and God bless. Im a 23 year old millennial and i think our generations and the upcoming ones will find solutions, try to leave this on us.

I can mind read their motives and come up with valid reasons why they could avoid that venue and still act in good faith. My views on the science arose before they were politicized. AGCC has a strong case, skeptics haven’t presented anything I’ve read that refutes the left side of this guys blackboard. He did a good job except for framing nature’s obviously profound influence on climate over eons but misses the correlation of mankind’s intensifying and accelerating economic activity over the past several decades. These compressed timeframes combined with industrial inputs, second order effects like feedback loops, reduced albedo etc nullify the puny human can’t produce the kinds of changes we are seeing. So I’ve looked cosmic ray cloud seeding in some layman’s depth and find it wanting, I can refute the too little CO2 argument relative to total, when you look at measurements longer than those cherry picked a few years back it looks to me like measurements are right. So you can see I’m not focusing on the ‘what do we do about it’ piece. I cannot credit any argument, and I’m not saying you would make this argument, that doesn’t start with is mankind causing it and how fast will temperatures rise and what effect would that have on the biosphere. If we can agree on that then we can debate what to do about it.	UCDItBPcTcW-qQDuqyB-k2yA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDItBPcTcW-qQDuqyB-k2yA	1	UgzYhn1wsGPHc0C3td14AaABAg	Triple fife

Still, even if it is your view as to it being a setup, then what about me calling into question their faith in themselves? If someone was sure of their argument, what would it matter if it had taken place with Stossel as the moderator or a unbiased robot judge (since every human and even robots have built in bias I used this as a example)? When people don't show up, it shows they don't fully believe in what they are preaching. Then there is the "we aren't going to debate them because they are X" argument that I end up hearing often enough. The X being something they don't agree with. Why would any critically thinking adult put their trust in those who are unwilling to allow another's thoughts and instead using the silent treatment in order to "win" the debate which never happens. "The silent treatment is an abusive method of control, punishment, avoidance, or disempowerment (sometimes these four types overlap, sometimes not) that is a favorite tactic of narcissists, and especially those who have a hard time with impulse control, that is, those with more infantile tendencies." Would you trust someone who employs such tactics against you?	UCPseBTJTgo8ZKEy2QvtwnDQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPseBTJTgo8ZKEy2QvtwnDQ	1	UgzYhn1wsGPHc0C3td14AaABAg	Triple fife

Even if it was a trap, a lions den or whatever else you want to call it, to say they won't show up because its a trap, makes it sound as though they can't handle it. Can you really trust those who can't handle a simple debate? They either are to scared, have knowingly to weak of a argument or are unable to handle a simple debate. Frankly I don't have any respect for those who are to afraid of what may happen or are to afraid of what their peers may think. Lastly if it lands on them knowingly having a weak argument or are unable to handle the debate, then they already prove with their absence who has the stronger evidence/convictions. Again, I'd love to see it, but I have little faith it will actually happen for the above reasons I stated. Thanks for the comment and furthering the conversation. Hope all is well.

You might have better luck with a consensus trusted figure but who today in our polarized world fits that bill. I saw a debate moderated by Mehdi Hassan on BBC I think. It had Richard Lindzen with an IPCC scientist. Not a heavy hitter and Lindzen might be the AGCC skeptics most capable and accredited climate scientist. He didn’t change my mind, despite being given a lot of rope to speak, and never really was able to render the consensus theory inoperable at all. This debate will likely not succeed because the conditions for the bate are political and no one wants to step into a lions den.

But you wouldn't do that, it would be stupid. Just because something causes job opportunities doesn't mean it's good for you. CO2 is plant food for a fact. That's a great opportunity to increase the biomass of the planet and feed billions of people. You can't divorce CO2 from the global warming and still use it as an argument against it. It doesn't work. Either it causes problematic warming and we need to curb it or it doesn't, in which case we want as much as possible of it. Meanwhile air pollution can be cleaned up, CO2 isn't pollution. Making solarpanels and windturbines causes just as much pollution as making anything else.

We were in a mini ice age in the 1800 while we already were starting to ramp up the C02 and cutting and burning forests down. And there was NEGATIVE TEMPERATURE ANOMALY. Then, throughout time, C02 levels have been MUCH HIGHER than today and we werent here. And during this time glaciers were fine.<br />In other words, media propaganda doesnt say half of it. Climate is a complex and chaotic system and any scientist saying that we understand climate when we cant predict the weather correctly 3 days ahead is lying.<br />Again, i am all for dumping fossil fuels. Pollution isnt only about C02. There are things much more harmful that it to us. I want a new humanity based on sustainability. BUT AS FAR AS BELIEVING IN INCOMPLETE THEORIES with SEVERE GAPS...

They don&#39;t take into account the increase in concrete or asphalt around the recording areas, which inherently increases the temperature above the ground where it is recorded.

I think events may well have overtaken your 2013 paper. The formula for compensating for the UHI effect has been altered since then I believe. Also, new automated stations have been set up in underground urban sites and recording stations on board ocean going vessels have been placed in hotter positions . As for the satellite data this has clearly been radically changed on the pretext that the satellites' orbits have decayed. There are interesting graphs and papers to be found at www.ceres-science.com and of course the warmists' Bete Noire Tony Heller has issued some pretty irrefutable videos. I agree we skeptics must be careful of fallacious arguments, but equally we must not underestimate the lengths the Warmists will go to in order to peddle their doctrines.

Their data started at a known low temperature period and ended with a known high temperature period. Had their temperature data gone back to the late 1800's and early 1900's, it would have shown no temperature rise. This is premeditated fraud.

However, the resource you provided gives more skepticism then not. Two key ones are: 1) The concept of Homogenization of the weather date, primarily temperature. The article states... “Homogenization is a somewhat complex term for a conceptually simple idea. Climate variations tend not to be purely local so changes in temperatures over long time spans (longer than a month) will be highly spatially correlated. Any major changes over time in individual stations that are not reflected in nearby stations are likely due to local (rather than regional) effects such as station moves, instrument changes, time of observation changes, or even such things as a tree growing over the thermometer stand. By removing any artifacts of individual station records not shared with other stations in their region, we can get a more accurate estimate of regional climate changes.” This shows that data at one observation point is somehow disregarded based on data at another site having some level of discrepancy caused by poor data collection. While I understand the article can’t detail in depth, the mere concept of “removing data” from a sample should alarm anyone. The correct scientific approach would be to “certified” the location and method of data collection at each site. Not say...well this data point on this day, time, location, etc. is wrong because this one is better. That raises much more concerns than it eliminates. The complex scientific lingo of “harmonization” seems disingenuous to me. Harmonizing data would seem to have a significant risk of leaning into if not overtly trying to come to a predetermine outcome. 2) What are the data collection methods? Well, the article refers to the Cooperative Observer Program which The National Weather Service says this (see this link for the full explanation https://www.weather.gov/coop/overview ) “A cooperative station is a site where observations are taken or other services rendered by volunteers or contractors. Observers are not required to take any tests. Automatic observing stations are considered cooperative stations if their observed data are used for services which otherwise would be provided by cooperative observers. A cooperative station may be collocated with other types of observing stations such as standard observations stations, Flight Service Stations, etc. In these cases, that portion of the station observing program supporting the cooperative program's mission is treated and documented independently of the other observational and service programs.” There is nothing that says observers or instrumentation is setup or certified as part of the program. In fact, my own weather station in my backyard was reporting for a while. No one called or visited in anyway to vet my station as being in a proper location to report. No one ever called if my station was down or had problems reporting. Nor does the NWS say how any on-site observation by persons uses a standard method of collection, such as don’t take temps under trees, on pavement, etc. it seems to me some algorithmic method is used to “account for collection discrepancies”. This is the very heart of the matter of climate science. Data collection is not a swag or inconsistent methodology in any experiment. The heart of any scientific study is collection of data. Excluding collected data from your experiment and analysis is tantamount to discrediting it by saying “Well our collection method has errors in it.” Further, it shows a weak scientific mind who doesn’t see that the solution is to vet at the front end on how data is collected. These are the types of flaws climate change skeptics see and call out only to be seen as deniers.

Here's a post by Zeke Hausfather who investigated this issue in his 2013 paper. It nicely summarizes his findings: http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2013/02/urban-heat-islands-and-u-s-temperature-trends/ . Furthermore, measurements of outgoing radiation via satellite also show a clear warming trend since the late 70s which is when we first started taking satellite measurements and these further agree with surface data. This doesn't prove anthropogenic warming is happening but it does disprove the idea that the temperature record is flawed or that there has been no warming. I think it's important that us true skeptics remain objective as peddling fallacious arguments just hurts our cause.

Much of the temperature date is urban and suburban based and at 20 ft from the ground. When the limited rural and altitude temperature data is considered, there is little to no temperature change.

The warming is about 0.13 centigrade per decade. <br />Is this a big problem or beneficial? Is sea level rise accelerating? Are we causing instable weather? Are the model predictions of several degrees trustworthy?<br />I don&#39;t know but I&#39;m leaning towards: not much of a problem, No unusual sea level rise, no changes in weather that can be linked to warming and no, the models <br />are based on assumptions that have shown to be wrong.<br />So, am I a denier? Do I think it&#39;s a hoax?	UCS2ppcpw4XaJzc3uUCD4p3w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS2ppcpw4XaJzc3uUCD4p3w	0

It’s normal for the earths climate to shift from an ice age(in wich we currently are in-&gt;frozen poles) to a warmer climate. The problem is not the climate change itself but the fact that irresponsible use of fossil fuel etc. is accelerating this change in a really dangerous way. And it shouldn’t be a discussion if it’s real or not because there is a scientific consensus that climate change IS reality and it doesn’t care if you believe in it or not because you will suffer it’s consequences like everybody else.

It’s just shit like this where you’re told to believe the 99% consensus but when I do some of my own research there are many scientists out there, not just tony heller, who completely disagree with the climate hysteria. There is no consensus. Climate change Sceince has become too wrapped in politics and politics always has an agenda. The earth doesn’t. I don’t believe humans have the computer models to accuratey predict the future especially when my local forecast isn’t always right. I just do not believe a computer model has the power to run and properly simulate all the variables on the earth and it’s climate. There’s too many and we don’t even fully understand them yet.

To say "is accelerating this change in a really dangerous way" is something that could not be proven even if it were all true. You would need 2 earths, one with our conditions and one with less carbon dioxide observed over generations. LOL. I think the solar output cycles (surely) and (it seems, possibly) changes in earths magnetic field may have more to do with it. They cannot even say there has been average warming globally in the last decade anyway, hence changing the name to climate change. We have many environmental issues but I doubt 400 parts per million ( 0.04 %) of atmospheric carbon dioxide is amongst the most pressing.

Unless you or your dad is a climate scientist your thoughts and opinions are worth jack shit when it comes to the actual science of sea level change, which you should read by the way: https://science2017.globalchange.gov/chapter/12/ 2. "They always say in 12 years, then 12 years comes and the earth is fine" -- the only people who say this are dipshit politicians and those in the media. The science would never predict something so stupid, and it never has. This quote is often misunderstood from an actual report by the IPCC ( https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/ ) that says we only have 11 years (as of right now) to seriously change the amount we rely on fossil fuels if we want to try and keep global temperatures from rising above 1.5C 3. "I don’t believe that humans, who don’t even fully understand how the climate of earth works due to so many different complexities, can produce a computer model that can accurately predict the earths climate because i call bullshit." -- Well lucky for us, we don't have to rely on you simply not understanding how it works, we can look at the actual evidence and decide for ourselves. If you have evidence to suggest we've gotten our climate models wrong, I'd love to see it. ( https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/globaltemps_agency_comparison_2018.gif ) 4. "go do some research yourself and not listen to everything the MSM tells you" I 100% agree that you shouldn't listen to everything MSM says about science, after all, you still have news channels that want to promote the idea that it isn't even a problem or has nothing to do with humans. You should go look at the actual science instead! 5. "look up tony heller" Tony Heller is completely full of shit when it comes to the science of climate change. I dare you to produce one peer-reviewed scientific research paper that is published in a credible scientific journal that agrees with the dumb shit he spews out.

UgxPn0FT9uF3fXoLEcZ4AaABAg.91YaJ_IHeJX91ntJlVwLQn		0	2019-11-26 15:43:24	Franz Maier	@Daniel Danielson "Water vapor is 25 times worse than co2." It is indeed a way more potent greenhouse gas than co2. However, there is good reason why we do not directly try to influence water vapor concentrations in the atmosphere. The warmer the atmosphere, the more water vapor it can hold. If there is too much water for a given temperature, it just rains. So even if we forced water into the atmosphere for some reason, it would go back to normal quickly and nothing really changes. Co2 is different. If we put more into the atmosphere, it accumulates and brings its greenhouse gas properties to effect for a long time. This increases temperatures, which in turn increases water evaporation and the atmosphere's ability to hold water vapor, which increases temperatures even further. This is a positive feedback loop. Water vapor leverages the effects on temperature an increase in co2 has. "I can't stand this bogus co2 argument, since over 90% is of natural sources." This is a common misleading point. It is only true in the context of carbon flux. There is a constant exchange of carbon from and into the atmosphere. Animals breathe it out, plants take it in. Oceans degas it in some places and take it in in other places due to local changes in temperatures. You can imagine there is a lot of carbon moving around on the entire planet. If you take all the carbon that moves into the atmosphere in a given time, the part that comes from humans burning fossil fuels indeed makes up less than 10%. The important thing to know is that the carbon going into the atmosphere from natural sources has already been in the atmosphere not too long ago. From where do animals get the carbon they breath out? From plants. From where do plants get it? From the atmosphere. It is basically just cycling around in short intervals (which is why the concept is called the carbon cycle). Now our emissions are different, because the carbon we emit has last been in the atmosphere millions of years ago because it was trapped in the soil. Our emissions are therefore responsible for close to 100% of the increase in carbon during the past 200 years.

That’s an oversimplification. It’s trusted and unbiased entities like the Department of Defence, NASA, even Oil &amp; Gas companies like Shell did research that proved Global Warming is happening and hid it from the public, AND overwhelmingly scientific consensus (97%) agree that Global Warming, an aspect of Climate Change, is caused and exacerbated by humans action.<br />People can’t do their own research because they are not equipped with the skills, the scientific prowess, the knowledge, and their methodology needed to understand and evaluate such a complex topic.<br />It’s as if you are asking someone in the 1950’s to go do their own research to find out if smoking causes cancer, while they are not doctors, they have no equipments, and at a time when cigarette companies paid doctors to say smoking is safe!!<br />Listen to the scientist, listen to the experts, listen to the people who’s life work is this field. Not politicians, oil &amp; gas executives, and those paid by the Koch brothers.<br />When you say you don’t agree with the scientific consensus, really!! based on what?! What the hell? How could you say that without EVIDENCE?!<br />Scientists do not speak with 100% accuracy?! That’s a gross misrepresentation, bordering on a lie. They never speak like gods, on the contrary, it’s the religious zealots on the right that are like that without a shred of evidence. Most scientists are balanced and take care on how they talk about the topic.<br />You are grossly misrepresenting the topic, causing confusion, spreading ignorance and misinformation.<br />Please read more, get educated, you sound like every hack on Fox and right wing media, when I don’t think you are, you have dedicated this channel to give value and help others. <br />As for your invitation at the end, sorry but this is not about debate, it’s not about someone proving it to you, hundreds of scientists, massive organizations have put decades of work, and the facts are clear. <br />You should take more care what you put out there to your followers especially on a topic like this one that is having effect on global scale.

The club of rome and agenda 21/30 planned to privatise property and charge ordinary people more money to fund the elites and banks. Australia has already had enough of this and has woken up to the scam. Pollution is a different thing, that is a problem but climate change is always happening. Global warming is a myth.

I snapped a screenshot of the warning accompanying this video... You dare to question climate change, so Google/YouTube labels all potential “deniers” of any official narrative with little posts from Wikipedia that lets you know the correct narrative you’re supposed to believe. <br /><br />I know cuz I get these all the time!!! 😂. Facebook will also publicly shame you if you post against the narrative, they will flag your post and offer alternative articles to post and then you are on notice that you are a dissenter. <br /><br />I would love to see that kind of challenge on your channel but I’d have legal check new service agreement that takes affect December. It’s pretty draconian from what I can see. <br /><br />Maybe you can do an infotainment video on what the new agreement means for all of YouTube because knowing Big Brother, and the powers that be, they are trying to seal the deal 🤝 a little faster than 2030 in regards to communications and freedom thereof. To stop exactly what you’re suggesting, critical thinking on these issues... <br /><br />Bet this video is demonetized huh??? <br /><br />But seriously, please keep going!!!

I think you're beyond my capability to educate, so I'll just send you this NASA article. https://climate.nasa.gov/resources/global-warming-vs-climate-change/ "You don't think it at all strange to form a consensus by removing anyone who disagrees with you?" No, it's strange to form a consensus by removing people who agree with the science. "You think thats solid science?" No it's a pragmatic method with which to establish a philosophically consistent worldview. "The truth is this isn't about the environment, this is a vehicle for social and political change by people who believe the ends always justify the means" No it's a social and political change by people who believe that we ought to do something about climate change. "Consider this, 100,000 years ago the United States was mostly covered with glaciers" Yeah that's called a milankovitch cycle, it's dictated by the Earth's orbit, not by carbon dioxide levels. "50,000 years ago there was less ice, 10,000 years ago there was even less ice, 1,000 years ago there was even less ice" Yeah you learn about milankovitch cycles in grade 3. " today there is even less ice, tomorrow there will be even less ice. You don't see a trend here?" The rate of melt has spiked by 40x over the last 100 years; therefore the trend is broken. "Why weren't the native Americans declaring their campfires the cause of global warming when the glaciers receded north and the great lakes were formed?" That might have something to do with the fact that fires don't cause global warming, and they never had a scientific method.

Scientist make a distinction between global warming and climate change because climate change is an average of short term events while global warming is a long term trend. It's also important to know that measuring and predicting global warming is quite easy, while measuring and predicting climate change is extremely difficult and requires huge computing power to crunch the numbers, climate scientists use huge super computers to produce climate models, and even still, they aren't very accurate. Predicting hurricane rates and precipitation rates across the globe is requires quadrillions of calculations. "prevent them from being hired, and deny them funding" Well yeah... if you're a geologist who claims the Earth is flat, or a climatologist who claims climate change doesn't exist; you're going to have a hard time finding a job. "The problem with people like you is you can't allow anyone else to believe something else" I thought you're the one calling for debate?

When global temperature increases, this effects the climate; for example... the strength hurricanes and the length of hurricanes season is contingent upon high ocean temperatures, therefore an increase in global temperatures will increase the probability and intensity of hurricanes over time. Another example is snow, the probability of snow forming decreases the further below 0 the temperature drops, therefore northern countries like Canada and Russia will experience more snow in the Winter due to increased temperatures. The globe warms, the climate around it changes. "Also, it's only substantiated by those of you who all agree with each other" No it's substantiated by roughly 20,000 peer reviewed scientific studies collected over the last 100 years by all scientific institutions in the order; which means yeah... scientists discussing climate change tend to agree with each other on the substantiated stuff, however they disagree on the non-substantiated stuff. "I don't mind at all if you want to believe that" I don't mind what you people believe either, just don't put your anti-science in my kid's science class. "What I do mind is people like you trying to destroy anyone who doesn't agree with your "substantiated" science" If somebody believes the Earth is flat or that climate change doesn't exist, they are destroying themselves.

When we debate science, we debate that which hasn't been substantiated, not that which has been substantiated. As an analogy... if we find a dead body with a gunshot wound, the next step in our investigation would be to substantiate the circumstance which led to guy getting shot, was it suicide? Murder? Who knows? However... we don't keep discussion whether the guy is dead or not; that is already substantiated knowledge. Now back to climate change... the fact global warming is causing climate change, and humans are causing global warming is already substantiated science, what we're trying to do now is figure out that which hasn't been substantiated; for example... what measures need to be taken to stop it? What is the point of no return? 400 ppm? 450 ppm?	UCa7UP_E_q8WLs-lVyFGPyMQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa7UP_E_q8WLs-lVyFGPyMQ	1	UgxZUL-f1lRyoC7HEnp4AaABAg	eric k

Flat earthers can make some very compelling and logically sound arguments from the perspective of those that are not very educated in scientific fields. It will not be a fruitful event, because it requires the audience to be highly educated to determine who&#39;s arguments are factual. The arguments from those that believe in climate change need to shift from presenting the science, to more logic based arguments like &quot;we need to get off fossil fuels anyway, because in the end it is a limited resource&quot; or &quot;even if climate change isn&#39;t caused by humans, the effects of our current forms of energy consumption are terrible for the environment in general (i.e. plastic/air/water pollution).&quot;	UCdMAt3pRTw0psHsifgwfDdA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdMAt3pRTw0psHsifgwfDdA	0

The climate window for a given region includes many weather phenomena. For example, hurricanes do not hit Ohio, where I live, directly like they do Florida. The Ohio region has a different Climate Window ( snow, cold, -20 F is the record where I live and 104 F is the summer record where I live). Florida experiences a different Climate Window with much more humidity and longer periods of heat, but little if any snow and cold. The Florida Climate Window is different than Ohio. Florida's climate window has always included severe hurricanes well before humans arrived. So you see that the Climate Window is really unchanged........it's the weather that changes within the Climate Window.

Plastic inhibits growth of biological life like plants and animals because of reduced sunlight and choking animals etc. It also takes up a lot of space that the plants would have been able to grow into otherwise, combined with that plastic doesn't decompose for hundreds of years if not thousands. Rain is an example of a natural phenomenon that is severely affected by the plants moisture going into the air. No plants = less rain = climate change and this is just a simple illustration of direct causation.

He may be the most credible anti climate change person alive and he is wrong. No model ever created using the atmosphere, planetary albeido, tilt if the earth, solar maximums, daily insolation, and fossil records works without co2. It is a mathematical fact. Correlation is not causation I know. But if you really really dig deep, it’s not something that can be refuted. It’s hard for an average person to understand the earth as a system. You would need to be versed in a combination of very complex subjects like sun cycle or fossil records with carbon weathering. It takes significant time to research. Co2 is the gas of life. But too much of a good thing.... if you factor in the oceans emitting co2 as they warm we are responsible for about 110% of climate change currently.

Its real and both sides know it, but action will be detrimental to one group so regardless of the grave consequences, that group will do anything to stop action to mitigate its effect. There have been many debates and the deniers loose every time, the problem with this guy is he pretends there is debate. It’s like saying: a person jumps out of a plane at 10,000 ft without a parachute or such device to slow them down and debating whether he will live or not.

The problem is that our temperature is increasing faster than has been observed at any time. This type of change usually happens over thousands of years whereas now it's shaping up to happen over hundreds of years. The thing about co2 is that there isn't much in the atmosphere but double it and we're fucked.

The issue is the narrative that humans and carbon are the sole reason for it... there's been 5 mass extinction events in earth's history caused by some kind of disaster that significantly altered the climate. Climate change will happen, but not without certain groups getting rich off the narrative and leveraging for power by blaming fossil fuels.. which humanity could never stop using without significant lowering of the standard of living for everyone. Not to mention the underdeveloped world would never experience an industrial revolution and will perpetually be poorer and poorer... literally EVERYTHING we use on daily basis down to our socks is made with the burning of fossil fuels.. Also, we are apparently coming out of the younger dryas ice age from 11,500 years ago, so it's expected to get warmer..

You can pick any &#39;mainstream&#39; climate scientists for the alarmist side, it doesn&#39;t really matter.<br />I suspect the skeptics will agree to debate and the alarmists will not.

Mandatory solar will soon be a nationwide requirement in order to meet peak demand which is 4 hours per day 2 in the am 2 in the evening. The rest of the time they have extra energy available.good news is solar wind and batteries have become practical and less expensive than fossil fuels.

Then there are another 35 years of know resources, which aren't immediately economically viable. New reserves will need to be discovered and mining technologies developed, and they are. There is finite amount of lithium on Earth, but it's enough to electrify transportation. You need to discover and mine it, so it's not like it's going to jump out of the ground, but it's there, waiting to be discovered and dug out. That quote is about supply shortages of cobalt, like Elon Musk mentioned. Shortages are just that, shortages, not all out depletion of resources. Those can and will be resolved in due time. Like I've said from the start, it won't be easy, but it's not impossible. As a side note, I don't think we should use lithium batteries for stationary storage as it's much too precious for that. And as the article mentions, battery technologies aren't stagnant. New discoveries are made continuously. It's funny that the article mentions peak oil, as it turned out to be a scare tactic and total bunk. Finite resources will one day run out. ...If used infinitely, but demand doesn't work like that. Turns out we can't even use all the fossil fuels there are without dooming the world due to global warming. Fossil fuel companies new this as early as the 70's, but instead they came up with that nonsense about "peak oil". Funny that...

Otherwise at today's production there is enough for hundreds of years. https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/is-there-enough-lithium-to-maintain-the-growth-of-the-lithium-ion-battery-m However, it's Cobalt that is the concern: I found this article in Forbes Cobalt Supply Shortage Could Boost Prices Even More But let’s focus on cobalt for a moment. Global demand for the brittle, bluish-white metal has skyrocketed in recent months, exceeding 100,000 metric tons for the first time last year, according to mining consultant CRU Group. Over the next 10 years, it’s projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.6%. And because around two-thirds of the world’s supply is mined in the highly unstable Congo, a supply shortage is likely brewing. Add to that it is highly unhealthy to mine cobalt because it causes a number of diseases, the concern is just as bad for the health of those miners. Cobalt is far, far worse than the fake political agenda that has so many believing that CO2 is bad, which it is not.

Electric vehicles are huge in Norway, one of the coldest countries in the world. It's not science fiction, they are already here. But it takes time to replace all existing cars. That's going to take decades. That's false. Global warming wasn't suddenly rebranded climate change as so many denialists like to claim. IPCC was established already in the 80's, and guess what it stands for? I'm talking about global warming, because that's what Greenhouse gasses cause and it's the main reason they have to be combatted. Other changes in climate are a relatively minor issue compared to it in my opinion.

They do reduce GHGs unless you replace a new car. Best would of course be not to own one, but considering we are talking about transportation of goods, that's really not an option. Eletric vehicles will be the future and are a key part of the solution to global warming.

As it happens they recently tried allowing higher cargo capacities in Finland and found out it has positive ecological and ecomic impacts, and adoption has been good. It's mostly a matter of desing and legislation. Make trucks longer and increase axel numbers, which limits concentrated load, and you should be fine. You obviously can't drive on a bridge that can't handle the total weight, but realistically how hard is it to drive around or use a smaller truck if impossible?

After a quick check, Tesla is preparing to launch them next year. The batteries cut to the payload a little, but that's easily avoided simply by increasing maximum weight allowed by law. It's a small hickup, not an unsurmountable obstacle. Not like we would starve or anything because of it. Biggest problems in my mind are ramping up production and the price tag. Managing those will take time. Travel distance is already quite enough for European use, as you couldn't drive further even if you wanted to due to work day limitations. I think there may be similar limitations in the US as well? I'm not sure, though.

This world is filled with organisms eating each other, and chocked full of deadly natural conditions from ice ages, earth quakes, Tsunamis, floods, disease epidemics, etc. In spite of all this conflict and pain we have managed at great sacrifice to impose a small measure of order and stability with technology and determination. The idea that our CO2 emissions are a big problem is a big fat lie. There are 100 more pressing issues and most of them are due to natural forces we don’t have much control over. I like a clean act as much as the next person. But it wasn’t too long ago that the developed countries has institutionalized slavery, genocide and nasty sanitation problems plus a long list of disgusting habits. I say wait another 20 years to watch the IPCC predictions fail like they have for the last 20.

If not for big companies the government itself more than likely has a plethora of solutions to different problems, but due to outside influences are keeping quite about it.

If people wish to join the 3-20% of scientists who disagree with the so called consensus, they should do it on a scientific research basis, judged on their own merits, rather than on platforms involving appeals to emotion etc. to gain favor of uneducated people. Personally i'd prefer it stayed within the rigorous scrutiny of the scientific method. I suppose if people had the time or energy to debate complex concepts to people with no education then power to them. Good luck finding people with the time though.

You see you can justify ANYTHING if you backwards rationalize it and that&#39;s why debates are useless. You see science and not just one scientist but a great majority 97% agree on climate change. Also i dont like the term climate change it&#39;s misleading since you need to include waste, plastic and chemical corruptions for a bigger picture of the problem here. These all add up to a great environmental disaster and if you are not yet up to date to realize there is an issue i suggest you do!

UgwMB6raROLhWH-JdGd4AaABAg	0	0	2019-11-20 01:05:49	No Body	Anyone that has a basic middle school level understanding of science knows that the climate is always changing. Its only one side that uses the global temperature as a way to tax people, and scare people. The reality is we do not have the power to regulate the temperature of the entire planet. There are too many variables we can&#39;t control. Even if we did everything the alarmists asked us to do it would only theoretically prevent a 1 degree change over 100 years. Trillions of dollars for a 1 degree change. What we need is nuclear power and electric cars. Problem is that if you outlaw regular cars guess who would suffer, poorer nations. And if you outlaw fossil fuels then poor people will burn dung and trees and that will accelerate whatever the rate of pollution and deforestation is now. I&#39;m sorry but climate change really isn&#39;t the issue. The issue is the stupid solutions people come up with that are super expensive and deliver little results. To me its just a way to scam people out of money. Nuclear power creates no emissions. Thorium reactors which currently are not being used cannot melt down and can produce enough energy to power the entire planet for millions of years but no one is building them. Wonder why. There is no money in making stuff cheaper. But there is money in taxing the shit out of people. Its not that climate change isn&#39;t real its just the people in charge of pushing the solutions are all scumbags who don&#39;t know anything about science. They just pay scientists to do studies that agree with their political views on both sides. Its just really sad that we are focusing on such an inconsequential issue. We should be making nuke plants like thorium reactors that are safe and produce no pollution at all and also don&#39;t produce plutonium which is used for weapons. But no we don&#39;t do that because then poor nations could have cheap energy and there would be no slave labor to take advantage of in 50 years. The people in charge are not smart and they don&#39;t care about anything but power and money for themselves. Period.

Nature can adapt to changes happening in hundreds of thousands of years, it cannot adapt to changes happening in short spans of time. Massive vulcanic eruption have caused sudden climate changes in the past, which led to mass extinction events. The problem is not if Earth can survive climate changes, it surely can.

If the US took action NOW we would stimulate the economy in ways we haven&#39;t seen since the Internet boom and as a byproduct live longer and healthier. Who cares if its a real phenomenon or not, the positives from taking action ARE FAR better than inaction. And in the case where it is real less people die.

There is human influence but it is not as catastrofic as alarmists claim. We must realize that both sides have their own motivation to exaggerate claims. The truth is in the middle, as usual. However, the most important thing I think is missing in presentation is this - are we sure we need to do something to prevent change even if we are 100% sure that we are those causing it? In my view, almost everything is better in warmer world. There is NO more weather extremes, there are LESS violent weather events like tornadoes or tropical cyclones, and also there are LESS deaths caused by freezing which still happens so much more often than deaths from heat. There are researches about that but not often presented much. In warmer climate MUCH less energy is required to keep cities warm, less energy is needed to run vehicles and other machinery, in warmer climate and more CO2 plants grow so much better, so we have more food for ever growing human population, and so on and so forth, there is endless list of benefits from warmer climate. Two most important things to support life are much cheaper in warmer world - food and energy. In turn, there are some downsides like sea level rise, that will affect some, but MOST of human population will VASTLY profit from climate warming in my opinion. If you look at population density and species diversity maps (humans, flora, fauna, fish), you will find that all of those are concentrated mostly in tropics and other warm areas of Earth (excluding deserts of course), and the colder areas are the less life there is. This tells us a lot about what climate optimum for life support is. And last but not least, if ice age is coming within 1.000 years of so, maybe the ONLY way to save the planet is from freezing to almost life extinction - actually man made climate change that we are doing now.

Venice is made up of artificial islands build in a swamp whose foundation is sinking just like the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The airport Japan built on an artificial island is also sinking and has nothing to do with weather. Every year, Tropic of Cancer moves north by 15 meters and the weather on the surface of Earth where the Tropical Zone moves changes accordingly, this is due to the natural shift in the inclination of the Earths axis, this is what causes ice ages, the Laws of Physics.

Life on earth is struggling to adapt, evolution and other natural processes cannot react quickly enough.<br />The rise in the rate of increase of the earth&#39;s temperature correlates with the industrial revolution, with a delay of just a few years. Irrefutable fact.<br />We will experience a minimum 2 degree Celsius rise from the baseline, and unless we act very soon it will be significantly higher.<br />We are entering The Anthropocene. The human race is responsible.<br />Immediate action is required. The time for pussy footing about is over.<br />P.S. Great idea for the debate Pat... A high ranking scientist from NASA, Elon Musk and David Attenborough are my picks for the side of good and truth. An apathetic blackmailed scientist, Donald &quot;Fake News&quot; Trump and an oil company CEO should face them (in the absence of Penny-wise The Clown, Emporer Palpatine and The Scrooge)	UCvvQS2rPUmiDVq5m01o1xkg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvvQS2rPUmiDVq5m01o1xkg	0

UgzDwZ3IUDEOosIDxtB4AaABAg	6	10	2019-11-19 23:34:50	Adrien Bellaiche	There are a lot of false equivalencies in this video, and, given how researched it is, it kinda sells these false equivalencies as well as some already debunked myths.<br />Just a few :<br />- The atmosphere isn&#39;t getting thicker per say, but, on a metaphorical level, it&#39;s accurate enough .<br />- Alaska : the thing is, &quot;global warming&quot; is a bad wording for the issue. For the short version, let&#39;s just say that 1/the weather will be more extreme, heat waves will get even warmer and cold weather will be even more freezing, 2/ a lot of the current balance of the world will be redrawn. Depending on which place you are looking at, icy places may become even more cold or melt completely, and desertic areas may expand or disappear as well. Example being : the Alaska ice getting thicker.<br />- Science doesn&#39;t say &quot;We know A causes B&quot;. Science says &quot;we have numerous proofs of a correlation between A and B&quot;. But it means &quot;A causes B, this is not debatable stop arguing about it&quot;.<br />- Science doesn&#39;t say &quot;We know A doesn&#39;t cause B&quot;. Science says &quot;there is no proof of any correlation between A and B&quot;. But it means &quot;we have all the proofs we need to say A doesn&#39;t cause B&quot;.<br />Because, unlike PR companies, science is careful, and is open to be updated. If one day, one study goes against the consensus, it still doesn&#39;t disprove it. You need peer review and repeat experiences to ensure the conflicting study isn&#39;t just a fail. But if it passes that verification, it updates the scientific consensus.<br /><br />If you want the really short version, here is what can be expected based on the current scientific consensus (that means not just one study or two, because these means nothing, but all of the available studies compared and analysed together) :<br />- Due to fossil fuel emissions (mainly, but not only. Bovines farting methane is also a major concern. It actually is, don&#39;t laugh), we, humans, are changing the climate at an unprecedented rate.<br />- For a few more decades, the average temperature will slowly grow, and some areas (mostly around the equator and the polar areas) will be strongly warmer.<br /><br />- Heat rising will slowly make the sea level rise, sinking a lot of currently shore areas. New York will, in the end, fully be underwater.<br />- By 2100, coffee will be extinct. Oh and also there will be a lot (around a billion depending on who you ask) climate refugees whose current housing will be underwater.<br />- We can mitigate our long term (60-80 years) effect on climate change by acting right now, because the inertia of the climate is huge. Like 40/50 years. So if you are 20 and you want to drink coffee when you&#39;ll be 80, you need to act right now.<br />There are other conclusions, but these are the big ones.

Please enlighten us with what you, a specialist in bullshit, consider a worthy evidence, while the scientific consensus agree on the facts, on the numerous available evidences, and the predictions following these facts.

The MSM is a waste of time except for the most basic factual information and a few exceptional journalists and the headlines. Scientific 'consensus' is useless. We can only understand reality by questioning our thoughts and ensuring they match history and observation. Scientists are more often wrong than right, and especially so if there is consensus. Things like 'peak oil' and food shortages were accepted consensus predictions that never came to pass. Things change, there is no crystal ball. What could be is the the same as what will be. If you look at the history of past climate predictions name one that has occurred? Just 1. What is the strongest piece of evidence that the climate is changing? Just 1 piece of evidence that is incontrovertible.	UCJTc2bg1N2M5kVBmhXYOfZg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJTc2bg1N2M5kVBmhXYOfZg	1	UgzDwZ3IUDEOosIDxtB4AaABAg	Adrien Bellaiche

I have been reading the studies for years and can't find any definitive evidence that CO2 captures heat. In fact, when you look at the older plant species aka (cool-season plants) they were unable to close their stomas which means they evolved with cool weather and high CO2 ppm. I hate pollution but CO2 is not pollution.	UCtKNVxXG7gh8yDhyvTvD5-A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtKNVxXG7gh8yDhyvTvD5-A	1	UgypQsyCTj0CrCtWqbZ4AaABAg	stu oliver

We live in a semi-slave (semi-free) world where often one way is forced. on all, for hidden agendas, not for the stated reasons. No matter. Even with good goals, force fails. The initiation of force violates our human nature to be free to think and act. War is socially accepted force, and contrary to what authoritarians tell us, e.g., it was necessary, had winners, humanity loses, in the long run. <br />In conclusion, the majority superstition, a faith in force, sold to them from birth as unquestionable, is the root problem. If that continues, humanity may self destruct. <br />Only a world where reason, rights, and choice are the norm, is survivable. Time is running out. Humanity needs to learn how to think; It must stop using superstition and obeying authority. <br />It&#39;s all about personal sovereignty which is contradicted by state sovereignty.

I asked the same question regarding man&#39;s contribution and the true answer is we truly don&#39;t know. Many people have asked for debate but the people who believe in climate change won&#39;t debate us. You asked for names, here&#39;s one scientist, Willy Soon is a scientist that only cares about facts and science. Look up his presentations and those of his colleagues. Also, check out &quot;Friend of Science&quot;, they have a channel on youtube, they are a Canadian outfit that questions gov&#39;t and climate change but do so in a debate format and with facts.

They say the reason they do not engage in public debates is because the average person would not understand the data and formulas. Seriously, search the internet all day and night. You will never find a debate between an IPCC member(s) against ANYONE. Seriously. Could you imagine a public live TV debate between the IPCC climate scientists and someone like Marc Morano? The ratings would be HUGE! But the climate scientists hide in their ivory tower and keep everything a secret.	UCzJwcitXdJ14nrLF6eSY0ZQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzJwcitXdJ14nrLF6eSY0ZQ	0

What do we have to lose, if we would take effective measures?<br /><br />I have no damn clue what is so bad about a society that is consuming less unnessecary products.<br /><br />I have no damn clue what is so bad about a world with less cars, less traffic jams and more fit people riding their bikes that have been gathering dust for years.<br /><br />I have no damn clue what is so bad about organic food, wild forests and green cities...<br /><br /><br />It&#39;s obvious that people are frustrated with a lot of things that are going the wrong way. But people forget that not words, but actions make a change in the world. And if you are not satisfied with anything, do something about it.<br />The world is going to end anyways.

Investing into renewable energy sources will increase energy independence of the country. There would not be dependence on middle eastern countries to provide oil and no economic strains should the price of oil fluctuate. 2. We know that fossil fuels are finite. Therefore sooner or later we have to switch to renewable energy sources anyway, then why not do the transition sooner rather than later. 3. Burning fossil fuels damages air quality. In some cities in Asia they have to wear masks just to breath. 4. Renewable energy technology is becoming increasingly economically viable therefore it is not like money is getting wasted by investing in such surces. Etc etc. SUMMARY: It does not matter whether we are the cause or not. Other factors mean that whomever is right, investing into renewables and asking people not to just carelessly throw away trash does not seem like a bad idea	UCfw-E7FBv4ejvFgreKN6zVg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfw-E7FBv4ejvFgreKN6zVg	0

I would like to expand on what you said. There is natural variability in the system, however, change has never happened at this rate before. There is a high correlation between CO2 concentration (not thickness....) and warming on a global scale. Anthropogenic (human-caused) activities mainly burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil increases these level which therefore leads to a change in the climate system.

Of course this is not even looking at the corrupt politicians always looking for money, same with the Bankers, and to say nothing about the big variance between how much ????? is product between countries.

But despite that there is almost unanimous consensus on the proven science. Unanimous. Read that again. Overwhelming agreement in the scientific community.... there is no debate. There isn’t 2 sides.

Pollution is a real problem in this world, but the world is not ending because of it. Imo we do not need to panic, just be more careful about large companies polluting unnecessarily. We do not need some government crackdown where the people are taxed for driving and we dont need a bill that is billions of dollars in the name of stopping climate change. I lean more that we dont need to worry about climate change, we just need to adapt and be smart about things like natural disasters that happen every year in the same place. We are capable of thriving and just need to be prepared for natural disasters like hurricanes and fires. But the government seems to be spreading fear unnecessarily.

If they can’t predict what the natural phenomenons will be for tomorrow, how can they tell me there is a correlation with CO2 in the atmosphere with all the weather problems we face? ( Basically if we are really fully aware of what affects weather and climate, how can we be always so wrong with previsions for climate and weather) Thruth is they don’t know what is going on, but they surely will tax us on it!!

They were finding vegetation in areas where there had never been vegetation before. They expect this growth to continue in an upward trend. No matter who is causing this CO2 spike (not us), the earth is adjusting like it always does.

Trump calls it a hoax made up by China. Second of all, it doesn&#39;t matter what the % of it is caused by man. What matters is can we have any impact on reversing it, which is a legitimate debate. Third of all, even if we are helpless to reverse the problem, we shouldn&#39;t shit where we eat. The Trumpists are anti-ecology. For the first time in history, we have a group of people that go beyond just putting money over ecology conservation but are actively pro-pollution.

To make those water plants grow I had to buy a bottle with some backing powder or something in it which produced CO2 when filled up with water. This CO2 had to go into the water which got absorbed by the plants and they grow huge after that and my fish were still alive.....that came back to me after politics said that CO2 is fricking dangerous. I thought about it and came to the conclusion that it can‘t be that bad. especially when politicians say that. That‘s why I am skeptical about this whole thing. According to my own experience. Maybe we should just stop destroying forests and it would be fine?!? 🤔	UCvsjLKx0puDWmg6tuXS5Iyw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvsjLKx0puDWmg6tuXS5Iyw	0

The human impact on the Earth is a slightly exaggerated problem, but a problem none-the-less. We need to meet in the middle and deal with our impact in a livable and sustainable way. Eat LESS meat, drive only as much as necessary, and stop subsidizing the growing population across the globe. We are artificially inflating the global population with our welfare policies. Populations will grow to meet the resource limits that are in place. As much as we think we are above other animals, we are a stones throw away from rabbits and mice. Live responsibly and hand down a habitable Earth to the children you raised and reared with the resources you earned.

Their is something to do with the em field helps protect the atmosphere and that is the reason that Mars lost theirs.

He is the lead author of the study recently published in Geophysical Research Letters. *"Historical records of solar activity indicate that solar radiation has been increasing since the late 19th century. If a trend, comparable to the one found in this study, persisted throughout the 20th century, it would have provided a significant component of the global warming the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports to have occurred over the past 100 years," he said.* NASA's Earth Science Enterprise funded this research as part of its mission to understand and protect our home planet by studying the primary causes of climate variability, including trends in solar radiation that may be a factor in global climate change. The solar cycle occurs approximately every 11 years when the sun undergoes a period of increased magnetic and sunspot activity called the "solar maximum," followed by a quiet period called the "solar minimum." Although the inferred increase of solar irradiance in 24 years, about 0.1 percent, is not enough to cause notable climate change, *the trend would be important if maintained for a century or more. Satellite observations of total solar irradiance have obtained a long enough record (over 24 years) to begin looking for this effect.* Now consider this study is using data that began being collected around 1979. The Modern Maximum began around 1914. The Dalton Minimum ended around 1820. So solar activity was increasing for over the century this study said would be necessary for it to have a large impact. LOL I read the science and since 2008 its gotten a lot more political and a lot less scientific.

Measuring aerosol release isnt the same as measuring the cooling effect of the aerosols released. https://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6427/eaav0566 Here take your own advice and actually read some of the science literature. RATIONALE Quantifying the aerosol cloud–mediated radiative effects has been a major challenge and has driven the uncertainty in climate predictions. It has been difficult to measure cloud-active aerosols from satellites and to isolate their effects on clouds from meteorological data. The development of novel methodologies to retrieve cloud droplet concentrations and vertical winds from satellites represents a breakthrough that made this quantification possible. The methodologies were applied to the world’s oceans between the equator and 40°S. Aerosol and meteorological variables explained 95% of the variability in the cloud radiative effects. RESULTS The measured aerosol cloud–mediated cooling effect was much larger than the present estimates, especially via the effect of aerosols on the suppression of precipitation, which makes the clouds retain more water, persist longer, and have a larger fractional coverage. This goes against most previous observations and simulations, which reported that vertically integrated cloud water may even decrease with additional aerosols, especially in precipitating clouds. The major reason for this apparent discrepancy is because deeper clouds have more water and produce rainfall more easily, thus scavenging the aerosols more efficiently. The outcome is that clouds with fewer aerosols have more water, but it has nothing to do with aerosol effects on clouds. This fallacy is overcome when assessing the effects for clouds with a given fixed geometrical thickness. The large aerosol sensitivity of the water content and coverage of shallow marine clouds dispels another belief that the effects of added aerosols are mostly buffered by adjustment of the cloud properties, which counteracts the initial aerosol effect. For example, adding aerosols suppresses rain, so the clouds respond by deepening just enough to restore the rain amount that was suppressed. But the time scale required for the completion of this adjustment process is substantially longer than the life cycle of the cloud systems, which is mostly under 12 hours. Therefore, most of the marine shallow clouds are not buffered for the aerosol effects, which are inducing cooling to a much greater extent than previously believed. CONCLUSION Aerosols explain three-fourths of the variability in the cooling effects of low-level marine clouds for a given geometrical thickness. Doubling the cloud droplet concentration nearly doubles the cooling. This reveals a much greater sensitivity to aerosols than previously reported, meaning too much cooling if incorporated into present climate models. This argument has been used to dismiss such large sensitivities. To avoid that, the aerosol effects in some of the models were tuned down. Accepting the large sensitivity revealed in this study implies that aerosols have another large positive forcing, possibly through the deep clouds, which is not accounted for in current models. This reveals additional uncertainty that must be accounted for and requires a major revision in calculating Earth’s energy budget and climate predictions. Paradoxically, this advancement in our knowledge increases the uncertainty in aerosol cloud–mediated radiative forcing. But it paves the way to eventual substantial reduction of this uncertainty. The rest of what youve claimed is just regurgitated propaganda with no basis in real science supported by the scientific method.

You should stop watching heller and actually read the science literature. Moreover, solar cycles have been corrected for when determining temperature rises. Also there is no better correlation of temp rises than rising CO2 in the current warming trend. Everything you've said has been thoroughly researched. You seriously think that scientists didn't consider looking at solar output to correlate with warming ? Then you must think that either heller is a genius or that all the thousands of scientists across the planet are in a conspiracy.....both of which are laughable	UCbCX6UKqA6vV47FloiUpWhg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbCX6UKqA6vV47FloiUpWhg	1	UgxG5wbyVHcldlgKMrd4AaABAg	Wolfgang Walden

He's covered the milankovitch cycles many times even before this back and forth with pothole. Co2 has historically lagged temp. Its claimed that recently during the industrial age this has been reversed. However there isnt really enough evidence to support that claim. So much data has been adjusted and "corrected" to keep this agenda driven "theory" alive. We warmed exactly when we were supposed to with the Modern Maximum and the end of the Dalton Minimum. There isnt really a scientific expirement that demonstrates the warming weve experienced is anymore than the natural warming we were due for. We release so many aerosols into the atmosphere as well that its entirely possible human activity actually prevent the globe from warming as much as it could have without human activity. The warming and cooling effect of human ghg and aerosols has never been quantified.

Known unknowns would be things like GCRs, volcanoes and changes in global cloud cover. We cant model these accurately so they are known uncertainties. Unknown unknowns are just that. Unknown we dont even know what else we could be failing to account for. Models are incomplete. They run 100s or 1000s of simulations and one or two may come close to what is ultimately observed. None of them have been spot on. What is Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity to Co2? unknown. Have we quantified the warming and cooling effects of human released ghg and aerosols? no. We were going to be warming during the Modern Maximum regardless of human activity so how much is natural vs manmade? you dont have a clue.

Environ. Res. Lett. 8, 024024). This claim, frequently repeated in debates about climate policy, does not stand. A trend in composition is mistaken for a trend in endorsement. Reported results are inconsistent and biased. The sample is not representative and contains many irrelevant papers. Overall, data quality is low. Cook׳s validation test shows that the data are invalid. Data disclosure is incomplete so that key results cannot be reproduced or tested. Even climatologist like Judith Curry have broken down why the consensus is a misrepresentation of the scientific evidence.

I don't know if that's because you aren't aware of Tony Hellers credentials or you're just saying what you want to be true....... willing it into existence somehow. Climatology covers multiple sciences. Oceanography, atmospheric sciences, meteorology, ecology, geology, physics, biology and more. All scientists bring an expertise in their respective disciplines to form concensus (of which there certainly is not 98%). Maybe you are easily persuaded by counter arguments to Tony's videos. That's fine, but please don't just take somebodies word for it because it lines up with what your personally want to be true. You have to look into it for yourself, and I can tell from your answers that you do not do that. If you did do that, you would know that all of Tony's work is backed up by official graphs, climate models and papers which are all contained on www.realclimatescience.com. You can scrutinise and verify everything he's saying from there. You would also know that Tony holds a BS in Geology from Arizona State, Masters in Electrical Engineering from Rice Uni and a BS in Geochemistry from New Mexico Uni. He was also a lifelong environmentalist and a wilderness ranger in New Mexico while also a science teacher at Oak creek ranch school Arizona. The point is, he is a scientist and he is more than qualified to speak on the topic. Simply stating that he isn't to dismiss his research is not an argument. If you actually debating in good faith, I would suggest reviewing his credentials and citations for his research on his website.

Theres no scientific method involved there. Tons of papers make it in that dont use the scientific method. Peer review journals were tricked into publishing nonsense a couple of years ago by a few people who wanted to see what you could get away with publishing if it fits the agenda of the people in charge of that stuff. Computer simulations arent real world experiments. You cant observe what hasnt happened yet and wont for decades or centuries. Do you even know all the steps of the scientific method? Doesnt seem like it. Or maybe you just haven't read the studies pothole likes to pick from so you just operate on faith that they meet the standards of the method.

Let's also not forget that there are literally thousands of scientists who completely refute AGW.......and no, they are not part of some trump based, oil money conspiracy. I happen to know 2 of these scientists personally, Michael and Ronan Connelly here in Ireland. They have both produced irrefutable academic papers on AGW with replicable experiments. You can read their papers here: www.globalwarmingsolved.com Obviously, I know you won't read any of it, because you're not interested in the truth, but there it is for you anyway. As I said, I site Michael and Ronan for you as I know them personally and I know for a fact that they have no links to oil companies or any other such conspiratorial nonsense.

I assume you said I was bringing up irrelevant stuff, meaning the manufacturing product demands of petroleum products in producing the thousands of different products that require that material? If so, I fail to see how to use a product if the product is still in the ground ........... and you stated this was the ONLY reason for “deniers” . If you think being critical and analysis of a recommendation or theories or data or estimated modeling to follow, etc etc is NOT needed , well actually not only NOT needed but also NOT welcome NOR allowed. Now if someone locks you out, gives you a summary of what his PERCEPTION of what’s in the locked area and then makes serious demands of you to act on this info and also refuses to answer any questions to help further your understanding of what is in that locked area, if you think you should just act in total blind devotion to the guy that has the keys to the lock, well that’s up to you. But I will tell you most people aren’t like that. When they are told NoT to ask questions or to see data or to have discussions, it makes them NERVOUS and causes them to loose incremental invested trust in the trustee. The longer this situation ensures, the larger the loss of overall credibility the “expert (or I called them Trustee above) “ again combined with things like INSULTIng the intelligence or acting in defiance or spreading intense fear like “Do or Die” type cases WILL always produce a “less likelihood of completion “ in that situation. Listen I have been thru too many behavior:/group decision matrix scenarios both real-time and mock up. The results are always very predictable when certain factors are present. Bottom line, CC people are not going to win over people By doing what has been done so far. I would have thought after this much time had passed that obvious fact would have been apparent?

They rely on *programmed* computer models (simulations) programmed by people who are dead set on pointing the finger at co2. As mentioned in the video we were in a "mini ice-age" in the places of the world that have the most complete data sets from 1300s to 1800s. We entered the Modern Maximum around 1914. It was time for warming again. Cycles. The circle of life applies to more than just lifespans.

They would keep pumping. I have petroleum products in my hand as I write this, on my back as a article of clothing, the seals in the plastic of the door of my car, the makeup my wife wears, the plastic that makes up the case around this phone, I could go on for years. Petro is a massively useful material and thankfully we have been blessed to have access to something so dynamic, so powerful, so relatively cheap but simultaneously containing high levels of energy given the ratio of cost to energy it contains. I think we should be rationale about Fossil fuels here and acknowledge that they will be with us for many many years until something else better supplants that source of a raw material and also a fuelsource	UCtcF0DoBvGA3EdKMpgZi0Jw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtcF0DoBvGA3EdKMpgZi0Jw	1	UgxG5wbyVHcldlgKMrd4AaABAg	Wolfgang Walden

Try and look at this very flawed and fatal conflict of interest. The tentacles of this conflict, the political connections and potential fallouts resulting in how things progress SHOULD cause all of us on this planet to be very critical of anything that comes out of this Climate Crisis Multinational Machine. With that being said, I see it as only reasonable that conclusions or recommendations that have such far reaching impacts should be heavily scrutinized in countless ways before the world starts to accept whatever is produced as "Fact." I would say the same exact thing about many many totally different areas and topics of research whenever as much that the final Theory, proof, facts, papers, etc. are produced in situations where the environment is contrary to a 100% neutral, non-renewing situations were massive amounts of money will not be rewarded nor received unto ones self based on the fact of whether the prevailing theory is goal purposed and confirmed, proven or disproven. Perhaps my lack of sleep is effecting my sentence structure but I just want answers coming out that are 100% unbiased and not effected whatsoever by outside forces. Now while I realize that is literally impossible, especially at this point I still would maintain that we should at least strive for something close to that for this particular field of research and any other type research that may have such far reaching impacts on all of the citizens of the world. Given how people have been treated by some others associated with Climate Change with such contemptuous distaste and demonic public vilification simply because these people wanted further details, answers, opportunity to ask questions, etc. has now poisoned the whole situation and caused an amount of distrust now for this very difficult and complex problem I fail to see how good will come of this. I realize that is in the past, however I just want to make sure I am very clear on that as well as I see that as another factor that has further complicated what was already an incredibly complex topic in the first place. What a big mistake this was. Additionally, what's amazing EVEN right now here in the US as of Nov 2019, the mainly tax payer funded side of the Climate Industry professionals are still holding fast to their "INSULTING, INTOLERANT, NO QUESTIONS ASKED ("DISSENT") policy. Call it debating or whatever you want and that doesn’t really matter. We all can agree I think that this negative feedback loop is completely destructive and needs to be immediately abandoned and let us resume a complete bi lateral understanding. oh, one thing I forgot about. Publicly REMOVE ANY AND ALL of the global political reform talk that is present. This is yet another compounding factor that is causing great distrust for some people and by all rights it should as if we are truly trying to arrive at an agreement and understanding of a natural function of the earth, then all other pretenses, goals or motives should be left out of this conversation. While large scale change may be required, that will only be arrived with consensus once being successful on meeting the first objective I just laid out. Alas, I am most likely just wasting my time looking at mistakes already made and wishing for things to change towards removing at least some of the conflicts of interest that currently are glaringly present.

Anyone who has studied it knows that it is in constant flux.<br /><br />The issue however is that right now, based on historical trends, we are actually supposed to be in an ice age right now. An ice age would probably be equally bad for humankind. But by completely happy accident, our industrial revolution actually happened at just the right time and led to a stabilization of the climate in a perfect zone for human development.<br /><br />The issue now is that our industrialization has forced climate to head in the other direction when it should be heading down right now.<br /><br />The other direction (global warming instead of cooling) probably isn&#39;t deadly, like many doomsayers like to claim, but it sure isn&#39;t pretty. It&#39;s going to hit the human race hard financially if we don&#39;t work to fix it. <br /><br />So it&#39;s not really a matter of existential threat or not. Humans will survive (though casualties are of course tragically likely). It&#39;s more about spending money now to mitigate future costs. <br /><br /><br />What we want is not a complete termination of CO2 emissions. CO2 is going to keep us in the climate goldilocks zone we&#39;ve been enjoying for a few thousand years. What we need to do instead is carefully budget our CO2 emissions so that we keep the average temperatures constant, preferably giving a majority share of our Greenhouse budget to developing countries, as they are the ones most hurt by not being allowed to have industrial revolutions.

You seemed to pick the extreme side of climate change believers and the more moderate republican side to represent. I would say &gt;80% of people believe in global warming. But most of those people do not believe we have 12 years left to live or many of the bullets you choose. You&#39;re actually wrong that we don&#39;t have data from 20,000 years ago we can actually measure isotopes in ancient air trapped under ice. You mentioned there was an ice age before us and you literally gave us a temperature. Do you think we sent a man in a time machine back to measure that? 55 million years ago there was tropical trees at the poles. We were at what&#39;s called Thermal Maximum. When the earth reaches the peak of its greenhouse state. One theory an ice age began as a greenhouse emitting plant called Azolla became extinct. This is a good example of how living things can alter climate. We are currently in an ice age. I also don&#39;t like how this video attempts to make science political. YOU WILL NEVER GET A ANTI-CLIMATE CHANGE PERSON TO SERIOUSLY DEBATE. They are not rooted in facts to begin with.	UCfsvsZfs5JMQHe7LwuUazPQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfsvsZfs5JMQHe7LwuUazPQ	0

It maybe reacting to the activity of us dwelling in its mist but when I talk to climate change activist, especially the Hardcore ones the believe its man made, they never address the elephant in the room which is Depopulation and Sterilization. Activist always revert to a F Capitalism narrative but then want to throw money at the issue via jnsane tax hikes and economic reforms. There are tax incentives we can do to encourage a more greener society. but Lithum, Nickel, Cobalt are Poisonous healtg risk and the Mining that is going into these Materials are already Decimating the 3rd world countries like Bolivia that have it. So unless we discover or mass produce a better greener and safer alternative to Co2 which we breathe out, something like the Green New Deal would just be trading one problem for something probably worse but when you say this to an Climate change activist they get all Greta Thunberg on you and the conversation cant go any further than focusing on the Moral and Nobel aspects of Saving the Planet. Im more of a Logical and reasoning type of debater and I LOVE True Capitalism so an Anti Capitalist Economic Reforming is under the guise of saving the planet isnt going to be enough if a talking point to convince me it will save a planet we dont fully understand . . .

Yes, some people use Climate Change for political gains. However, the amount of research that&#39;s been compiled over the last 50+ years on climate change is so overwhelming. There&#39;s a reason Glacier National Park is losing natural formed glaciers. Why would almost every other country in the world be switching to green energy? Why have car companies begun building electric and solar powered cars? Why is it that people over in China deal with smog and air pollutants regularly? Why is it that the world is beginning to see more destructive storms each year? It might be climate change, but you tell me....

Water source for southern part of India is monsoon rain, not glacial ice or snow. <br /><br />Fast forward today in Summers, the south is constantly having droughts and its increasing every year.<br /><br />The problem in this case is soil erosion and degradation. <br /><br />Trees take the monsoon rain water below ground and keeps the top soil safe and the fallen leaves become manure (Green organic content) for land. <br /><br />Since people removed it, due to various reasons: population, bad marketing, farming space, bad govt policy...<br /><br />The rain water instead of going into the land, then traveling to the river and the sea (which is Natural flow). Started going on top of the land becoming floods and hitting the sea, removing the top soil and leaving the ground waterless for summer droughts. This is 4th or 5th worst year. It literally affects millions of lives and farmers.<br /><br />This above case is a man made disaster. But the impacts was only known recent decade or 2. <br /><br />I believe moderation is a must and we must act with wisdom - human species as a whole.<br /><br />Reversing billions of trees is not a 1 day job. <br /><br />Hard questions must be addressed like population, soil degradation and action must be taken. <br /><br />The Down side is always the opportunity seekers who only want to make $$ or power.

They always happened and they will continue to happen. <br /><br />The ambiguity lays about whether or not the human activities are contributing to modify the speed at which they are occurring. So far, the scientific method hasn’t produce significant proofs to close that debate. <br />Climatology is an extremely complex science involving an endless stream of variables and people should refrain from making an opinion without being able to frame the problematic properly. <br />Additionally, climate change and pollution is not the same thing. <br /><br />Thanks for the great video.

The PPM of CO2 has almost doubled since pre-industrial levels. The CO2 molecule is confirmed to have heat-trapping properties in the atmosphere. The shift of CO2 in the atmosphere is unprecedented. Yes, the earth has been warmer in the past. But no, it never shifted this quickly. Shifting this quickly because of the 30+ gigatons of carbon dioxide being put into the atmosphere every year has never happened before.<br /><br /><br />You can find plenty of research confirming everything here.

The temperature will NOT rise by 1 degree every 50 years. It goes like a fucking avalanche, like your 1 degree leads to the release of the CH4 stored under water, and this CH4 is much more powerful greenhouse gas than is CO2. Next you get a rise of probably 10 degrees in 50 years. What happens next is somewhat unclear, but the future of the very life itself on Earth is threatened. <br /><br /><br /><br />Next, can you wrap your tiny mind around the distinction of a quantity and the rate of change of this quantity? You don&#39;t need to look just at the average temperature. It goes through cycles. That much has been proved and you are right. Now, the rate of change of temperature is the scary factor. That one is perhaps unprecedented in the history. We are hitting all the thermostats of the ecosystem of the planet at once, and we may well set off a very much worse scenario than what you are depicting.<br /><br /><br />That attack on ALL the systems (forests, composition of the atmosphere, waters etc etc) that regulate the climate does NOT allow to work in percentages as you request. It is far too dangerous to even consider.	UCtz09RX0EjTc0EV0QHk-6qQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtz09RX0EjTc0EV0QHk-6qQ	0

Much of the speculation involved in AGW's doomsday-like predictions are based off of computer models that are highly sensitive to what data is fed into it by corruptible humans(see Climategate). With the foundations of the IPCC and UNEPP being what they are(see my statements about those who are pulling the strings), I'm at the point–unfortunately–were my cognitive dissonance takes over in most situations, especially when the narrative is at the forefront of the so-called science.

But it's not far to say that the uprising of the earth temperature will most certainly bring stronger storms and more harsh climates across the globe, leading to droughts that will kill millions of people. As humanity continues we are further reducing the natural balancers of earths C02, meaning that those so called doomsday events could be close to reality in a few hundred years. Like wise based on non bias statistical evidence in the past, aside from volcanic activity (which the earth has slowed way down from) there has been no point in history where C02 has rised at the rate it is now. With no effort being made to stop this expentonal growth how will earth not reach a "Doomsday Scenario" eventually.

Frauds like Climategate, Maurice Strong's "environmentalism", the tampering with of data sets and the absolute certainty of which they make their claims, even in the face of such frauds leads me to believe that their doomsday-narrative is just that, narrative, with rhetoric that is on par with religious dogma.

Meaning how has Man Kind had no effect on the earth. Explain how lowering the ability for the earth to naturally intake CO2 (Mass Deforestation, Production of C02 faster than recyclable) will not affect the earth's activities at all.

But take note that so called &quot;green&quot; energy is a 300 billion dollar industry. Do you think they don&#39;t have their own bought scientists? The oil industry has theirs and the wind/solar has theirs. Many politicians who are against oil have major investments in solar and wind: too bad the media is too biased to show this major conflict of interest. <br /><br /><br />And as a person who has worked in conservation, its idiotic to say that &quot;green&quot; energy is environmentally friendly. Just because the CO2 emissions is notably lower (not eliminated since you still have to mine, transport, and manufacture the stuff) does not mean there isn&#39;t a meaningful impact. Wind turbines kills tens of thousands of birds and bats each year, it also takes up huge amounts of land. And if you think prairie can exist under these things, think again: prairie needs burning but you can&#39;t properly manage the lands around wind turbines this way because you would damage the turbines. You also can&#39;t build these things near too many trees: so you either clear cut or destroy grasslands. <br /><br /><br />Solar is gaining in efficiency: its almost there with regards to its efficiency. But it takes up too much land: best way to implement is place it on all rooftops so it doesn&#39;t take up any land in and of itself. <br /><br /><br />Bu the major disadvantage with &#39;green&#39; energy is that it is inconsistent in generation, and tends to not produce when its needed most. Nuclear is the only safe and reliable electric producer after natural gas and coal.	UCAzKDKoJJP-SGEPnF7esdcg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAzKDKoJJP-SGEPnF7esdcg	0

My issue with Patrick&#39;s idea of having 10 scientists that believe that climate change is real and another 10 that believe that is fake and debate about it; the problem is that it present itself as a 50/50 problem. Most people believe that climate change is real TO SOME DEGREE, I would argue that 90% are in that camp.<br />If I present one guy believing the earth is round and another person that believes its flat. It looks like 50% of all people believe one way and the other 50% believe the other when in reality we have 99.9% of people that believe it is round.

I subscribed before you even had 100k subscribers.<br />I have a lot of respect for what you do, and as a fellow Texan, I&#39;ve loved your videos over the years.<br /><br />However, there&#39;s one thing that I really think you overlooked. <br /><br /><br /><br />In the 90s, Shell funded a documentary in which their scientists investigated the potential effects releasing Co2 into our atmosphere would have on our environment and atmosphere. Shell still has this documentary up for free on their website, and considering that they have every reason to ignore/disprove climate change, this documentary made me into a believer. I encourage you to watch the documentary for yourself. This documentary outlined many of the issues we see today with our environment, weather/climate, despite being made almost 30 years ago....<br /><br /><br />The documentary is titled &quot;Climate of Concern&quot;. It is available on the Shell website (its also on YouTube).	UCvDCU0VncBYcODy1JAZ_DjA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvDCU0VncBYcODy1JAZ_DjA	0

The key to solving climate change is being able to control our ecosystem such that we can continue to inhabit this planet - that is the long term. In terms of the percentage I would suggest that the extent to which we see warming is directly correlated with human life. I will do this but looking at the emissions against the measured concentrations of carbon would give you a strong indication of the extent to which humans are responsible.<br /><br />In terms of assessing the risk we need to understand how the concentration of gases in the atmosphere effect our climate. In terms of counteracting the damage we need to look to carbon capture be that through planting trees or developing advanced technology to extract/replenish materials from the atmosphere. Also clean water is crucial to overcoming this problem. That is an interesting problem to consider - what impact does/will sustained &#39;warming&#39; have on our water supplies. Do we have enough clean water to survive? Hence we need a sustainable method of water purification (let alone now but more so in the future)<br /><br />I had been discussing this issue and overall it appears that inadequate resources are dedicated to maintaining our ecosystem. If you look at the state of the environment - you look at the pollution in the ocean, the pollution in big cities it is clear there is inadequate attention paid to issues surrounding general health let alone recognising the status of the planet&#39;s ecosystem. <br /><br />I had eventually come to the conclusion that not being responsible for your emissions from an economic point of view is tantamount to poisoning water supplies. <br /><br /><br />Of course, any person that stands to lose money because of the damage their business does to the environment is going to counter that perspective. However, this issue goes beyond any capitalist prerogative. The habitability of this planet in my books is the highest priority in terms of establishing an acceptable basis of management. I think that it is fair to suggest to those who are at risk of loss because of climate action should consider the risks should action not be taken in their financial interest (there is none). <br /><br /><br />Clean Air and Clean Water = priceless	UC61027NOQwlBELPmo1hqYAw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC61027NOQwlBELPmo1hqYAw	0

There are new designs for hydro-electric that do not involve dams and are fish friendly. One design I saw causes no harm to species living in the water and is simply supplied from a shute coming off a stream. No impact on the environment. The one bad part of this particular design is that while it can supply a family dwelling it cannot yet supply a city. But with the right incentive from the government & private investors who knows where this design could go.

However, I do think government has a place incentivizing new industries that are not profitable yet, but will benefit everyone in the long run, including clean energy. It's definitely not there yet, and it will only be really a replacement when it's financially sustainable, and can beat the more polluting alternatives in the market. I think we can all agree that pollution sucks to live in. While I definitely disagree with extreme alarmists, I do think we need to do something. I wish people weren't afraid of nuclear, since it's pretty clean and the new reactors are much much safer.

UgzVUQ_DYEtymzURIbp4AaABAg.91XDcyLe2EH91XjCbZ-ZXV		1	2019-11-19 23:47:57	Joe Combs	@Ju yes I do believe too much pollution is bad for the health. And I like and use solar power when I can. But these politicians and scientist are trying to make it sound like it is crisis and drastic measures must be taken now. Funny how those "drastic measures" which must be taken now start with bigger more centralized government that has more control over every aspect of our daily lives. When I was a kid it was the coming ice age that was - you guessed it - caused by people. Next was the hole in the ozone layer. They said how the hole in the ozone layer would never close & could only get bigger. Then for the first time, in the early 1990s the ozone layer was measured. That's when they proclaimed "See we told you. The hole in the ozone layer is getting bigger and it is caused by man." But if that was the first time it was measured then how did that prove the hole in the ozone layer was getting bigger? Bigger is a comparison. If they only had the one reading then what were they comparing that reading too? But then as they continued to measure the ozone layer over the years that followed they discovered that the hole expanded, shrank, and moved based on the seasons (larger in summer smaller in winter). Yes We are the highest life form on the plant and because of that we are the stewards of the planet. Yes we need to reduce pollution. And we need to use all forms of energy available to us to help reduce pollution including nuclear and hydro-electric (which also has zero emission and which the fear mongers are also against). The United States has led the world in building the cleanest burning coal plants. But those cleaner coal plants are not being built in places like China and India because they are more expensive. The fear mongers are fine with that. It's Europe and the United States they attack and blame for "man-made global warming." The first writing contest I entered was a state-wide essay contest on ways to reduce water pollution. I was only 10 years old, but I won. I teach my 14 year old daughter to enjoy & love nature leaving nothing but footprints and taking nothing but photos and memories. There is always more each of us can do. But to destroy the economies of nations and give totalitarian control over our daily lives to elitist who believe they are superior to the masses and know better what is good for us than we do - that I will not do. According to Al Gore's acceptance speech for the Nobel prize the artic ocean was supposed to be ice free in the summers by 2014 and totally ice free year around by 2018. That did not happen. Every Prediction By Every Politician and scientist has failed to come true. The reason is their predictions are based on political desires and not scientific evidence. Yes The climate is changing. For billions of years the climate has changed and will continue to change. CO2 has been lower and higher than it is now. The planet has been through 6 major ice ages and numerous mini ice ages. This cycle will continue. 97% of scientists do agree the climate is changing, but they cannot agree on the causes. I will always do what I can to protect nature and reduce pollution. I will never submit to these fear mongers.	UCPcMbZ5M9Hf9riwUx7qvB2A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPcMbZ5M9Hf9riwUx7qvB2A	1	UgzVUQ_DYEtymzURIbp4AaABAg	noisycarlos

There is a ice mummy from Austria called Ötzi, he fell from a cliff into permafrost, which is how he froze within hours. It’s quite easy to explain this.

The 20 candidates for the Democratic nomination for president of the United States all embraced it along with many politicians around the world. As for speed? Many scientist believe that major climate changes happen rapidly not slowly. And to prove their view they point to mammoths found under the permafrost frozen to death with food still in their mouths. That didn't happen because of freedom loving right-wingers driving big SUV's all over the planet 10,000 years ago. The people advancing a man-made climate change are the same people advancing bigger more centralized government and more control over the economy, health, and daily lives of the people. Gee Surprise surprise Their "solution" for "man-made global warming" is a bigger more centralized government with more control over economy, health, and daily lives of the people. If that's what you want I have great news for you. Their are several countries you have to choose from to move to - North Korea, China, Venezuela, several in Africa, and a few in the rest of the world. But I will NOT give up my freedom because of a political agenda that pays for and gets the science it wants. A science that has not been correct with a single prediction it has made.

And they are the people who want control over our daily lives. It is not just politicians who want a small group of people to have total control over the daily lives of all the people. And Those scientist you "learned" about this supposed crisis from refuse to debate their opponents in any forum. There was a time in the earth's past that there was no ice in the Artic or Antarctica. There are plants and animals under the permafrost that cannot live in artic conditions. Mammoths with clover in their mouths are not the only thing found under the ice. So Why Since it has already been much warmer on the planet is THIS warming period "man-made" and why will it end life on the planet in 12 years (sorry, it is 12 years in 2018. Now it's 11 years)? The answer is Because if you believe them then you will willingly give over control of your daily life to a small cabal of people who believe they know what is best for you better than you do. Every Single One Of these "man-made global warming" fear mongers makes predictions about the earth. And each and every one of their predictions prove false. The date comes & goes when some new catastrophe is suppose to happen -- but it never does. "Hurricanes will become more frequent and worse" Yet when you look over the last 100 years of hurricane data you find out that once again they are lying.

Every measurement has error, which if you buy more expensive precision tools gets labelled (e.g. +.5/-1.8%). Using non-designed tools the error goes up. Time passes introducing more possible error. Once you get the sample into the “lab,” even your handling can also get in the way. And you have to add up all the errors, which gets hugely complicated, making it so that your error can exceed variation in measurement. Always ask about how much measurement error.

Ugx3m63WHsqFwEjhCad4AaABAg	0	2	2019-11-19 19:02:32	Matthew Bockholt	COLD HARD FACTS ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE: <br />1: The Earth is currently in an Ice Age. <br />2: Our current Ice Age consists of Glacial and Interglacial periods. <br />3: Glacial periods last about 90,000 years and cover 25% of the Earth&#39;s landmass in thick, uninhabitable ice sheets, while virtually uninhabitable permafrost zones cover nearly 25% of the land mass, and significant droughts turn nearly 25% of the remaining landmass into uninhabitable extreme desert regions. <br />4: Interglacial periods last about 10,000 years, where the Earth looks the way it does right now. <br />5: The current Interglacial period started about 12,000 years ago. <br /> <br />Just let all that sink in a moment.<br /><br />If you want to know how scientific &quot;Climate Change&quot; is, just look at what they call it: &quot;Climate Change&quot;. How very unscientific a term for such a &quot;scientific&quot; problem. It&#39;s an utterly meaningless term. Climate is always changing. The definition of Climate (current conditions) implies constant change. Why was Global Warming not a good enough term? Too easy to disprove. The actual, real, scientific term for this theory is Catastrophic Anthropogenic Global Warming. Or for short, CAGW. <br /> <br />Why do we use this term? Because it accurately describes the theory, and it takes each issue in order of importance. In other words, if you can&#39;t prove term 1, then we don&#39;t care. If you can prove term 1, then you need to prove term 2, or we don&#39;t care. If you can prove term 2, then you need to prove term 3, or we don&#39;t care. If you can prove term 3, you have to prove term 4, or we don&#39;t care. If all of the pieces don&#39;t come together, then your theory is bupkis. So we&#39;ll take them in order. <br /> <br />Catastrophic - It&#39;s a bad thing, and will cause problems for the Earth <br />Anthropogenic - It&#39;s caused by man, to a significant degree that it wouldn&#39;t be a problem otherwise (this is subjective, but for a lot of scientists a baseline is more than 50% human-caused) <br />Global - The entire Earth is effected <br />Warming - It is a warming trend <br /> <br />When you describe it accurately, you know what questions to ask. <br />1 - Why do you think it&#39;s bad? What specific catastrophes do you expect, and what evidence do you have to support your concern? If you can&#39;t convince me it&#39;s a problem, then why should we be looking for a solution? <br /> <br />2 - What man-made effects are contributing to the system? To what degree do they contribute? What about the past? Has it been this hot before human contribution? If so, how do you explain it? To what degree would our contributions have to cease in order to remedy the problem? How do you propose to decrease the man-made effects? Are the results of those decreases worse than the catastrophes you&#39;ve convinced me will result in not taking action? What about the natural trend for humans to create better technology over time? Is it possible that if we just leave things alone, our natural tendency to create more efficient technologies will fix the problem without any interference necessary? If you can&#39;t convince me that humans are causing the majority of the warming and that there are measures humans can take to prevent catastrophe without causing more problems, and that common technological innovation isn&#39;t fast enough, then why should we do anything? <br /> <br />3 - What proof do you have that the entire Earth is being affected? What tools are you using to measure, how accurate are those tools, and for how long have you had access to them? What other methods do you have for testing current patterns to prove that it isn&#39;t a regional problem, or that temporary hot spots in some areas are affecting the global average, but are just anomalies? What about the past? How do we know that current global patterns are different from past global patterns? We can not use modern real-time tools to measure past global temperatures, so how can you compare modern global data to past regional data, and call it a relevant comparison? If you can&#39;t provide sufficient evidence that the entire globe is being affected in a new and unnatural way, then how can you expect everyone on the Earth to agree to your solutions, that you&#39;ve already convinced me of, that are not as bad as the catastrophes that you&#39;ve already convinced me of? <br /> <br />4 - Why do you think the Earth is warming? What time periods are you using to show this trend? Why not longer time periods? What methods can you use to prove to me that current warming trends are different from past warming trends? What about the fact that we&#39;re in an Interglacial Period of the current Ice Age and nearly 2000 years overdue for dropping temperatures? What happens if we stop the warming trend, and then a cooling trend sets in that we can&#39;t stop and we end up back in a Glacial Period? If you can&#39;t convince me that the Earth is warming in a different way from past warming, and that it is somehow warmer than past warming, and that this warming, along with the catastrophes you&#39;ve already convinced me of, is worse than the expected cooling taking the Earth into a Glacial Period where 75% of the Earth&#39;s landmasses will become uninhabitable, then why should I bother to try and help you stop the warming trend? <br /> <br />I have yet to see any evidence or cause for acceptance of even the first question, let alone the myriad of problems with the rest of the questions.

As an example, many people traveling in Europe with a van, camper or you name it, &quot;runaway&quot; from cold winter in some specific countries where was much warmer. Those days, in most of those places, it gets colder than what use to be years ago. We see floods, snow in places that never seen before and so on.

There are more trees now than there were 35 years ago. 1000ppm is the ideal carbon level for plant growth (currently 450ppm). Carbon ppm was 12 times what it is today 400 million years ago (5000ppm). There is no emergency, but yes we should stabilise emissions. We should be worrying a lot more about toxic pollution and plastics. The carbon scam is about enriching renewable energy hucksters.

All myths!<br /><br /><br />All human behaviour in modern times is controlled by a &quot;hierarchy&quot; of 5 MYTHS! Myth 1. RELIGION ( belief in someone&#39;s version of right and wrong, good and bad - with a &quot;Fear Narrative; &quot; do the right thing and you will be rewarded in some mythical place (and conversely, you will be punished if you stop believing) - Then, as people questioned this &quot;Blind Faith&quot; system, it was immediately backed up with the second myth in the hierarchy; Myth 2. LAW - As faith failed to control people, force was used to get people to comply. Myth 3. MONEY -paying the self-appointed leaders and &quot;land owners&quot; for food to eat and to pay troops &quot;loyal&quot; to those enforcing the law (false trust) and those spreading religious nonsense and fear. Myth 4. &quot;THE NATION STATE&quot; wrap people in a flag and tell them the &quot;others&quot; (wrapped in other flags, with different religion, laws and leaders who (we are usually told) &quot;want your stuff&quot; and to change the way you live ( “loss of liberty” threat) what’s worse, they are &quot;coming to get you&quot;; so you need to fight for your &quot;rights&quot; (which we also just “invented”). This logical sequence of events required the 5th and final Myth in the hierarchy; - 5. &quot;OWNERSHIP&quot;; How can a human own a piece of a 4.5-billion-year-old planet that no one has any &quot;right&quot; to above any other? If I take something from you by force, is it mine? Historical conquests and even as far back to when we were forager hunters 200 000 years ago (which we were for 93% of our existence remember!) does not mean we &quot;own&quot; the land and can pass it on for generations because someone won a battle for some king or leader? How stupid! Says who? MYTHS! all of it. <br />(Quite brilliant for controlling behaviour, BUT, it’s only as real as we choose to make it, we invented this &quot;Society&quot;, we can end it by living differently, fairly and without fear being a key driver of our identity.

Human activity probably does have some effect on the trajectory of climate change (although I would argue that we arrogantly overestimate the role we play in the whole thing).<br /><br />The political rhetoric and proposed “solutions” surrounding climate change are a whole different thing.

But as for &quot;Catastrophic Climate Change&quot; caused by man I don&#39;t believe in it plus I would personally welcome the Earth warming. I don&#39;t care if Bill Nye repeats a million times the Earth (as all of Earth) is on fire just as I don&#39;t care if a KKK member states a million times x group are apes. I don&#39;t believe either. I live in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and it is cold. It will get colder as we get deeper in the winter season. That is as &quot;norm&quot; to Wisconsin as earthquakes and forest fires to California. I look out the window and I don&#39;t see Milwaukee on fire. So, Bill Nye thinks he&#39;s sooooooo smart and &quot;cool&quot; to be a Drama Queen and thinks I should get hysterical. <br /><br /><br /><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQnDGDXHNWU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQnDGDXHNWU</a><br /><b>Bill Nye Planet on fire clip 1080p</b> (38 seconds video--he takes a blowtorch to globe)<br /><br /><br />This is what is far more likely to kill me... in the neighborhood I grew up in (I&#39;ve been in that liquor store a number of times actually) that &quot;Climate Change.&quot; <br /><br /><br /><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clTewgja9PM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clTewgja9PM</a><br /><b>Police: 58-year-old man shot and killed inside liquor store near 38th and Center</b> (~ 2 minutes)<br /><b>18 Nov 2019</b><br /><b>FOX 6 News</b>	UCng5EMW6TfuhfSwFLe3Zy4w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCng5EMW6TfuhfSwFLe3Zy4w	0

I have a very low level of confidence in it. I took an environmental science course years ago in community college, so, I'm familiar with "carrying capacity" (related to population growth) and greenhouse gases (CO2). Given there is a lot in science not known how the climates work.... I just don't have a high degree of confidence in the greenhouse gases proposition. Particularly since politics is involved. Any science with so much politics involved is very likely to be corrupted. This is what I like about and trust more about computer technology science that makes smartphones or even electric cars... less political biases. I have just about zero confidence an accurate math "average" for the climate temperature of all of Earth can be obtained too. I also don't believe in a 1 climate Earth either. That said... if the Earth is warming then great. If certain places flood then it is a change we have to deal with. Nothing lasts forever a Mexican woman told me. Apparently that has been true of my vision as I've had to get prescription glasses. I'd rather world leaders spend time fixing the things they can fix. But alas they overthrow Evo Morales of Bolivia because he wanted to nationalize the rich lithium resource of Bolivia. Ted Cruz and Mark Rubio were behind that supposedly. And the country most rich in lithium is projected to be the next "Saudi Arabia" but of the electric car world of the future. Seems with war, corruption, and conspiracy that the more things change the more they stay the same. But I digress.

And sorry for the "Socialism" tag but our politician point to Europe and say "this is how Socialism works" when they wish to confuse people as I meant in the US "socialism" is trying to gain power by using climate change as a voting tool to pass laws that do not even effect climate or environmental concerns. Also I never said it is not a problem water quality is a problem, air quality is a problem, food yields for a growing world population is a problem, the mass dumping in the oceans is a problem, ect.

Humans will most probably survive as well, but already under a huge price being paid - in lives, economics and perhaps even in the levels of technological and civilizational advancement in the worst case scenario. One thing certain is that the price will be paid, the only question is when and with how much interest. It is absolutely irrelevant whether humans caused it, or if it is the work of nature. We need to fix it, the sooner, the better. The sooner we pay, the lesser the price.

The heat break the equilibrium that determines how much of the water from the ocean stays in water form and how much becomes water vapor and water vapor is a greenhouse gas. Then you have a positive feedback mechanism and the more you emit CO2, even if its not a big% of the atmosphere, the more the atmosphere absorb heat, the more the earth warms up, etc.	UCPK2DaXKB2ZHwsxE0dbhvBw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPK2DaXKB2ZHwsxE0dbhvBw	1	Ugxi9IR-vdgxpBOK0m94AaABAg	The Truthpost

Apparently a lot of historical climate data is projected using trees to infer how much CO2 was in the atmosphere (since plants thrive on CO2). I&#39;ve heard the argument (I haven&#39;t gone as far as accepting it yet, but I do find it interesting) that plants are actually evolved over many thousands of years to periods of far greater CO2 than the present.

If you take this approach and are right then you stand a chance of saving the earth. If you take this approach and are wrong you still have better air to breath, etc... as well as faster technological advances that would come with focusing on renewables, etc.<br />HOWEVER, if we proceed as though climate change isn&#39;t real then we stand a really good chance of killing everyone if we are wrong.

The burning of fossil fuels like coal and industrial revolution had a major effect on carbon dioxide levels. Destroying trees, plant life on land and in ocean exasperate the problem. However, It&#39;s misleading to say all climate change is due to mankind. The truth of the matter is we don&#39;t know what will happen. Since we are dealing with unknown, It might be wise to be cautious. There&#39;s no reason to drive 120 mph down a road at night with your lights off.

Educators and authors tend to reframe things to their political perspectives. So, I agree and disagree with your assertion. Certainly, the more you seek an education, the better, but it has to be balanced in perspectives presented. Unfortunately, climatology, much like evolutionary science, is so broad in scope that they are not simply defined.

I also started university in my late 20's, and now I'm in my early 30's after several years in the university as an adult, having gotten to know what the academic environment is like, I no longer take anything at face value because I know I can't trust career academics to be completely honest. Not because they're dishonest or immoral people, but because of the incentive structure and the pressure placed on them to fall in line to make sure they keep their job. I've been wanting to find solid data on climate change but it's so difficult to find quality unbiased research - especially anything that goes against the alarmist orthodoxy. If you could share the details of these Swedish scientists you've found valuable that would be amazing, I'd love to read up on the them for myself.

Depending on which temperature data set you go by there is evidence of a pause (ie. No noticeable warming) since the early 00's. So that muddles the water in regards to "accelerated warming". In regards to "unknown" natural processes, I would say that it is not a bad thing to research such things in order to learn more about them. Who knows, maybe there's some merit to it. What bothers me about the IPCC and its "studies" is that the conclusion is drawn before hand and the science is tailored to suit the narrative. Their terms of reference is that the climate is changing because of humans and only humans, so natural processes(wether known or unknown) are rarely IF EVER included in the final thesis. You can't claim 100% truth if you leave out MASSIVE amounts of data and other contributing factors. In my opinion the Co2 boogeyman and its loudest proponents are on par with the dogmatic following of the old religions– that it is striving supplant.

" , one needs to look at the individuals that pushed for the creation of the IPCC and who funds like minded organizations. Maurice Strong: Petro-Canada, *(edit)co-chair of the 1992 Rio Earth Summit with* ties to Standard Oil and father of "The Earth Charter". The Rockefeller family: Standard Oil, key in the creation of the UN and its environmental policies. The Windsors(AKA British Royal Family): British Petroleum, key figures in pushing the AGW agenda. Prince Charles said we only had 3 years until the end, he said that 4 years ago. The Rothschilds: Royal Dutch Shell(among others), worked hand in hand with the Rockefellers promoting the UN's agenda, key to creating the IPCC. The worlds largest oil companies(see Cartel) worked together to fund and create organizations like the IPCC —and others like it— that push the AGW agenda. The argument, that oil companies are fighting against those that are putting forward the "man made global warming" narrative and the "science" behind it, is FALSE!! *They are the very ones who created "global warming" as we know it today* They created the "problem", they anticipate our "reaction", and they offer the "solution". If they really cared about the planet they'd have done something about Fukushima.

Global warming and climate change are two phenomena occurring simultaneously ,the former is the cause of the latter. Man-made Global warming was first discovered by Svante Arrhenius in 1896 after a study conducted to measure the impacts of trains at the time, and it was later discovered that global warming was causing climate change in the 1930s, it's also important to know that the other uneducated person in this thread who said "before that it was acid rain" is also wrong; carbonic acid rain is merely one effect of increased carbon dioxide, which is apart of a process called chemical weather; this is all common knowledge.

Superstition and half-baked theory dominate the atmospheric sciences. Meteorological theories on atmospheric flow and storms have always maintained three superstitious and half-baked notions: 1) Convection. This is the superstition that evaporation makes air buoyant enough to power strong updrafts in the atmosphere (included in this is the belief that H2O in the atmosphere becomes gaseous at temperatures/pressures that have never been detected in a laboratory); 2) Dry layer capping. This is a superstition that imagines dry layers having structural properties that explain the how/why convection does not constantly produce storms and uplift; 3) Latent heat. This is the superstition that phase changes from a gaseous phase of H2O (which are purported to exist despite never having been detected and being inconsistent with what is indicated in the H2O phase table) to a liquid phase releases &quot;latent heat&quot; which itself has never been confirmed/verified. <br /> <br />In accordance with which, the current meteorological paradigm assumes hurricanes are caused by warm water. Actually the energy of hurricanes and all storms comes from jet streams and is delivered through vortices in the form of low pressure. Wind shear at low altitudes is the most important predictor of severe weather. This is because wind shear is the mechanism underlying growth of the vortices that are the transport mechanism of the low pressure energy. Warm moist air/water is not the source of the energy of storms, it&#39;s the target of vortice growth. <br />The &#39;Missing Link&#39; of Meteorology&#39;s Theory of Storms <br /><a href="http://www.thunderbolts.info/forum/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=16329">http://www.thunderbolts.info/forum/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=16329 </a><br />James McGinn / Solving Tornadoes	UCcg8R1ALfDP7sGkeIEBjkMQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcg8R1ALfDP7sGkeIEBjkMQ	0

It's like watching a video about evolution, and 50% of it is talking about how some people believe humans can from dust 6,000 years ago. Why bring that up? It reduces the informative quality of the video. If I'm watching a video about the solar system, why ought 50% of the video be dedicated towards people who believe the Earth is flat? The question posed in the video is... "myth or reality"? How do you answer this question? Like this... Premise 1: It's a reality. Premise 2: Here's a mountain of science as to why. What is a terrible way to answer this question? Well... Premise 1: Here's a bunch of claims. Premise 2: Here's a bunch of claims that contradict the other claims. "He also shows the opposing side’s belief, that corruption had falsified scientific data in the past, particularly with cigarettes" That's a false equivalency, because the corruption of cigarette companies was an attempt to cover up the damage of cigarettes to avoid bad publicity, while the scientific method is producing climatology to uncover the damage of fossil fuels. If you want a real comparison with cigarette companies, oil companies spreading propaganda about how coal is really good for the environment is a better comparison. "which is why I love free speech so much" Yeah here's my free speech... putting logically bankrupt ideas out there and pretending they are comparable to the scientific method is a logically bankrupt way to create an educational video.

This video doesn’t have that bias. “False balance” intentionally presents an issue as more balanced than the evidence supports. This video doesn’t do that. If you watch the video, he acknowledges that peer-reviewed scientific essays are on the side of those who believe that climate change is man-made. He also shows the opposing side’s belief, that corruption had falsified scientific data in the past, particularly with cigarettes. He’s not leaving things out to make it look more balanced. He’s just presenting both sides of the argument. It’s obvious that you would lean much further towards one side if you trust scientists, and that you think the other argument is invalid. If anything, he reaffirmed your belief that this argument is one-sided through his unbiased approach, because you believe that the opposing belief is ridiculous. But I like the fact that he presented this ridiculous belief alongside the scientific one. A civil discussion of clashing ideas is what makes America great, which is why I love free speech so much.

You still didn’t deal with the breakdown of solar panels, which will be another human problem on an industrial scale in the coming decades. For all your pompous answer. Yes, nuclear requires some resources to run, so? Your point on Germany only shows you have no answer and while the Germans are considered a very meticulous and industrious nation, they can’t get energy right. Nuclear is still the best energy resource available to man currently. On cost, longevity, low space requirement, power output, human resource management and emissions.

"Solar panels don’t last forever, they diminish quite quickly over a 25 yr period" First off... solar panels are one of a dozen types of renewable energy systems we use, and uou don't know what renewable means. Renewable energy is a energy generation system that requires only the system itself to produce electricity. Nuclear power is not renewable because we need to feed it Uranium, Beryllium, Hafnium, Zirconium, Niobium, and other rare exotic metals to keep it running. "You only need to look at France to see low cost energy, low emissions and nuclear energy on tap, compared to Germany, it’s neighbor having difficulty" The issues in Germany are not caused by renewable energy, they are caused by Germany's poor allocation of propriety renewable energy systems. How about Norway which is currently powered by 100% renewable energy and has no such issues? Canada powered by 70%? Brazil powered by 80%? You can cherry pick the worst possible outcomes if you like, but the overwhelming majority of countries who implement renewable energy are doing great. Including my country which is on it's way towards 100% by 2030.	UCa7UP_E_q8WLs-lVyFGPyMQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa7UP_E_q8WLs-lVyFGPyMQ	1	UgyaMoUWsZrIEcu-uRJ4AaABAg	Gareth Fairclough

"The whole "100 years left" idea is a myth" Correct, the 100 left figure is based on a 100% nuclear economy, at current consumption rates it's roughly a 1,000 year supply. "And as for the "18 years to build a plant" thing, that's down to over regulation" No it's called safe nuclear power. Nuclear power is extremely safe now, why? Due to extremely extensive safety regulations. You can't have your cake and eat it too, it's either safe well-regulated nuclear power that takes along time to put together, or unsafe nuclear power that can be whipped together over short time periods. "insane and totally uncalled for bureaucracy" Not really... the death of opinion on nuclear power is purely rooted in ad populum, elected officials as well as state repetitiveness are generally focused on renewable energy rather than nuclear because they understand that nuclear will take too long, it's practically inaccessible to 3rd world countries, and it's not renewable.

Nuclear energy because it's not renewable, and it relies on an array of exotic metals which have an estimated 100 year supply, and it takes up to 18 years to build just one power plant, which is not feasible within the time frame we're dealing with.

Maurice Strong: Petro-Canada, ties to Standard Oil and father of "The Earth Charter". The Rockefeller family: Standard Oil, key in the creation of the UN and its environmental policies. The Windsors(AKA British Royal Family): British Petroleum, key figures in pushing the AGW agenda. Prince Charles said we only had 3 years until the end, he said that 4 years ago. The Rothschilds: Royal Dutch Shell(among others), worked hand in hand with the Rockefellers promoting the UN's agenda, key to creating the IPCC. The worlds largest oil companies(see Cartel) worked together to fund and create organizations like the IPCC and others like it that push the AGW agenda. The argument, that oil companies are fighting against those that are putting forward the "man made global warming" narrative and the "science" behind it, is FALSE!! They created the "problem", they anticipate our "reaction", and they offer the "solution". If they really cared about the planet they'd have done something about Fukushima.

Now, contrast this myriad of evidence of information available with your own statements and ask yourself. What kind of person you are? Where do you stand on this issue? You were saying something about media and whatnot. With your own assertions, perhaps you should consider if you are not one of these very same persons influenced by the media... Just like the media, it seems you're all about amplifying the minor unknown details and bringing ambiguity, confusion and a "debate", when there really isn't. Are you sure you wanna be on that side of the field or would you rather inform yourself, before becoming part of the problem?

What is the value of ECS? The low end estimate of the unknown portion of ECS is 1/8 the high end estimate. Yikes! "Also, just because we don't know every detail about something, doesn't mean we are completely clueless. It means, we know what we know." If you know the history of ECS, you will know that we do not know much. "Just because you don't know if the sea level is rising, doesn't mean others don't know." A bit of a reading fail on your part, but no problem. I do know the sea is rising. What I know we do not know is whether it is accelerating. This has not been established. "For your information, this is known. It has already been quantified precisely and is also a well established fact. There is nothing rudimentary about it." Quantified precisely? Tidal gauges estimate SLR to be roughly 1.8mm per year, but satellites is around 3.2 mm per year . So about 60% more than tidal gauges. How precise is that? "Not that I think that telling you this matters much, because apparently you already made up your mind that this is a debate, instead of informing yourself before making assertions." My assertions are simple facts. If you don't know basic facts and refuse debate, then that is an issue. This is why we need the debate and you get to mock me when your facts prove my facts wrong. I think the real issue is talking past each other. For example, you believe that I didn't think the oceans were rising, but in fact I do. You missed my point.

You think you've discredited science, when what you did was really to demonstrate how little you know. Just because you don't know something, doesn't mean others don't know. Also, just because we don't know every detail about something, doesn't mean we are completely clueless. It means, we know what we know. For example, just because we don't know exactly how many ants there are, doesn't mean that ants don't exist. Just because you don't know if the sea level is rising, doesn't mean others don't know. For your information, this is known. It has already been quantified precisely and is also a well established fact. There is nothing rudimentary about it. As confusing as this might sound to you, measurements do differ, because the Earth is not a perfectly shaped object and there are tide dynamics and other minor details involved. I'm not gonna tell you the answer, because it doesn't matter and you can see the measurements for yourself. So, if you really want to know about objective facts, before making assertions, visit the Goddard institute from NASA, for example, regarding this issue. This guy on YouTube told you himself he's talking about stuff he doesn't know and told you himself to look go it up, yourself. Not that I think that telling you this matters much, because apparently you already made up your mind that this is a debate, instead of informing yourself before making assertions.

"not at all for well established facts known in the natural sciences." There are in fact not that many "well established facts" in natural science. Certainly not when compared to not well established facts. How many Polar Bears are there and what is the long term trend. Is SLR accelerating or not? What is the real value of ECS? Heck we don't even know if red wine is good or bad. "Whether or not humans cause climate change is not ambiguous at all and is not up for debate on scientific literature for decades." That depends on what you mean. Climate change is a natural process that humanity has modified. So humanity is a player but the science does not say how big a player we are. The consensus estimates > 50% and under 110% but others, would say it is under 50%. So called deniers likely fall in the under 25% category. Science does not have that answer and the literature is quite varied and rudimentary at this time. The internet is a terrible place to really have a debate as I demonstrated by nit picking your comments.

The great majority of on-topic popular comments around here either discredit the fact that climate is changing due to humans (and similar positions) or focus on the "ambiguity" of the debate. Very few comments fail to notice how the author of this video is himself unintentionally delivering untruthful statements, like saying that scientists don't know what caused the snowball to melt, etc. This only makes things more confusing... His analysis is interesting. The way he presents things work great for social sciences - by presenting different sides -, but not at all for well established facts known in the natural sciences. He says himself not to believe him and do your own research. You can run many of these experiments yourself or learn about them in other ways to know how things work, instead of turning this into a debate. Fortunately, some users pointed these things out and he is humble enough to recognize the importance of researching and his lack of knowledge on the field. Whether or not humans cause climate change is not ambiguous at all and is not up for debate on scientific literature for decades. So, yeah, we are SO screwed.

At this point, presenting this problem as a debate, rather than scientifically proven facts known for decades, is a great way to add confusion and misinformation.

ECS is broken down to the known and unknown portions. The the low end of the unknown portio is 12% of the top end of the unknown portion. In other words, take the low end, multiply by 8 and we get the high end of the estimate. This is the very base of climate science. You can`t get precise results when the base is uncertain. It is like building a half assed foundation on a skyscraper and saying the tops floors are perfectly safe.

There are too many factors to assert that global warming is entirely due to man. There are also unknown factors not yet incorporated into the equation like heat emissions underwater. Also, the results of man induced co2 additions are not being met. Where is the excess co2 going to? Is it being absorbed by the oceans or is it found in plant growth? Another myth is the loss of forestry. Satellite images have not shown a decrease in global forestry. Every year is declared the hottest ever yet records show no added warmth over the past 18 years. Either something is wrong with the data or something is wrong with the science. Science is not always right. Associations are not causes. If high levels of co2 happened during ice ages then it cannot be a cause for global warming. Co2 levels are relatively low. Plants die if co2 levels are below 150 ppm. We are much closer to co2 levels that are low for plant life than optimal co2 levels of 1000 ppm and higher. Green houses actually pump co2 in them not out of them. The change in co2 emissions need to be measured in absolute not relative risk. If you have a stadium with a seating capacity of 50,000 there'd be only 20 people in the stands comparatively speaking to the amount of total co2 in the atmosphere at 400 ppm. Doubling that would make it 40 people. Hardly a sell out. There are those that say co2 levels are a result of higher temperatures not the other way around. There remains lots of questions.

You'd need to only understand how politics works there to understand what happened. In relation to the scandal, the issue was the lack of proper oversight. 2) He said there's no way of measuring how much of the carbon in the air is because of man. That's completely wrong. The carbon emitted from burning organic matter (eg fossil fuels) is different from carbon emitted in any other way. Scientists know exactly how much is becuase of man. He left out so much information and reduced it to talking points. Go to Potholer54's channel here on YouTube if you want a comprehensive explanation on the science.

Since you were too lazy to research the fundamentals yourself, I’ll explain to you: what ACTUALLY contributes to sea level rise isn’t the melting of ice in general, but the melting of LAND-BASED ice INTO the sea (as well as increasing temperatures causing sea levels to rise due to thermal expansion).

The thing with Tony Heller is, he has many examples of weather catastrophes when CO2 levels were 300ppm and how the "experts" deceive you by cherry picking start dates in their graphs to "prove" global warming exists. The worst hurricane seasons were in the 1700's and have tapered off since. 100 years ago 50 million people died of the flu. If this happened today, I have no doubt it would be blamed on climate change. If Heller was in it for the money, he would join the global warming bandwagon. That's where the money's at. I find him credible because I have yet to catch him in a lie. I've confirmed his claims many times. Heller also has a lot of damming evidence of data tampering by NASA and NOAA, leaked emails of scientists discussing how to justify changing data and 150 years of newspaper articles of killer floods, droughts, heatwaves when CO2 levels were low and flip flopping between global warming (flooding Manhattan scare) and global cooling (ice age and glaciers destroying Manhattan), then back to global warming again. I'm a reasonable man. Show me the data that proves global warming exists and I'm on your side.

Also ofc what constitutes warming in the first place. Truth of the matter is that there's no single metric that everybody uses, and it's easy for propaganda to just pick a convincing-looking metric like antarctica ice cover and say it's increasing without knowledge of whether that's even a factor in measuring stuff like this. Climate is still a system with a lot of unknowns, and one failure of "IT'S WARMING IT'S WARMING" doesn't mean it's not warming. To address Tony Heller - haven't looked into him yet, but I HAVE been linked to and disregarded as motivated reasoning the website https://realclimatescience.com/2019/11/noaa-blocks-access-to-their-temperature-data/ before. I conversed for quite a while with one of these folks on Twitter. For example the article I linked to communicates the outage but not that it's back up. He's an alarmist mouthpiece for the other side, no more. If you're willing to be convinced to the other side, I can spend some time looking into his work. Every person matters apparently, in this issue that isn't really political to begin with. Jobs come and go, for some reason neither govts (subsidies, sops, like what the FED does with banks, company driven lobbying ("all our employees will lose jobs!")) nor people seem to understand that. We don't live in the 20th century, reskilling and learnign new things is a necessary thing regardless of a company dying.

This person also leaves out the fact that oil has saved an uncalculable amount of lives by being a relatively inexpensive and an easily transportable energy source that is utilized by most equipment that transports materials and providers power to construct and power domiciles to insulate humans from hot/cold/high winds/ect. Also, doesn't discuss "renewable energy" that is less reliable and that some store energy via battery cells that utilize less abundant minerals that are mined with equipment that use oil. Also leaves out NASA and NOAA data manipulation in regards to historical temperatures. Does not elaborate on CO2 parts per million. 180 ppm during ice ages up to 4000 ppm during the Cambrian period. CO2 is currently around 280 ppm which is closer to the inability of the earth and it's plants to sustain life. Does not acknowledge 2 separate studies from Finland and Japan about cosmic rays effecting cloud cover and that being the biggest contributor to climate change. Also that climate is always changing.

It&#39;s wrong to make such things political, people have to understand that climate change is our common enemy, it not a topic for debate, it&#39;s just like nuclear war, you can debate about how to prevent it, not should we prevent it or not.

"Keep in mind the world is greener than ever before" known as the Co2 fertilisation effect, we researched this in labs and open fields. and in nature, CO2 is not the limiting factor. " CO2 doesn't trap heat in absence of other GHGs...." that is wrong. has been shown wrong long before you were even born. 1896 it was. "of course with the exception of carbon's minimal heat trapping property of about a 3rd of a second" again, you show your ignorance. you do not even know how scinetist say the greenhouse effect works. IR photons are absorbed and reemitted in a random rirection, if CO2 molecules would hold on to it, it would not be a greenhouse gas. but as it is hit by a photon, the molecule gets exited and starts vibrating and so emits the photon again directly. and this is actually what causes the warming, when the photon gets reemitted in a random direction, it can happen that instead of going towards space as it shoeld, the photon goes back towards the surface and is absorbed by the surface. this is what scientist mean by trapped, not that the Co2 molecule itself traps it, but it is the ause of the IR radiation being trapped. in simpler terms, increasing the CO2 concentration of a planet's atmosphere , reduces the efficiency by shich that planet can cool off into space. when you try to debate scientific topic, you should inform yourself about the topic first. you are like one of those creationists that argue agaisnt evolution without even knowing what the theory states.

According to multiple climate scientists the ice cap is thicker now than it was in recent past. Climate change deniers is the first brainwashing that is used. The weather is always going thru cycles and changes and always will. To try and clean free the natural cycles iui s trying to play God .in the 70&#39;s the government was saying that we were going into an ice age in the next 50 years. Well what I&#39;ts it gonna melt or ate we all gonna freeze?? I&#39;ts all brainwashing and man should not be playing with the weather.i don&#39;t agree with everything you say but I still hit the line button bcuz your not pushing your belief, as usual you tell ppl to do their own research. The only problem with that doesn&#39;t have to do with you but the fact is 90% of pp lmk or more will not research themselves. If anyone researches NASA you will soon find out NASA is completely fake when it comes to space, unless we&#39;re talking about the space right above us. NASA needs to be defunded aswell as fake Tesla geo bfg all the subsidies and tab pair $.

Even within their own fields, they won't often try to critique bad papers unless they feel it's bad. It's amazingly easy to create a paper built up on bad data, or to otherwise manipulate the data to form a picture you want it to form. It's also just as difficult to fight such bad papers, despite the "peer review" tradition being in place.

Which is a lie. It is increasing. Then to back up his lie he shows a glacier in Alaska . Which to my knowledge is as far away from Antarctica you can get. So that's deception. He really tries to spin this whole peace as being neutral another lie.	UC3IBsJOIckRoWzB8HV-YTIg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3IBsJOIckRoWzB8HV-YTIg	1	Ugx3ikIoYLS3ZNjCwAZ4AaABAg	JonnyBeoulve

If we continue to raise CO2 now, not all plants will be able to utilize this, and thats why we are seeing an overall dying of fauna and animal species.
