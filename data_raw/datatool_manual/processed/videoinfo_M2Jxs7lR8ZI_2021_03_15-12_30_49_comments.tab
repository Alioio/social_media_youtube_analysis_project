Of course human population could drop a lot. Some (dumbass) people might say good - less population would be good. Problem is, while that drop is occurring, people start acting real shitty. It would actually be easier to just prevent the global cook-off by changing our consumption patterns and moving to renewable energy. It's not even that hard. Solar and wind is already cost competitive. It's amazing that human laziness and stupidity and greed are preventing us from fixing this.

However, straight up deniers really annoy me. People who are like, &quot; You believe in climate change? You must be a communist!&quot; It&#39;s like they use their political affiliation first, then think about the science second. People need to look at the information themselves, as there is a lot of disinformation out there and political parties will work their hardest to contrast themselves from their opponents (democrat vs republican). Climate change is happening and we have an opportunity to do something about it now.	UCY5EeVoLO3A5_68_5VeqOqw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY5EeVoLO3A5_68_5VeqOqw	0

Let’s follow that route and conservatively assume there are 90 % of scientists who agree and 10 % who disagree with man-made climate change. Let’s further assume these percentages stay the same since a definite, naturalistic proof for man-made climate change wouldn’t be found in the near future. We are now required to take action or rather decide either way: We either accept man-made climate change and fight it or we do not and continue with our current style of life. Since there isn’t a definite, naturalistic proof that let’s us know the answer, we have to guess which position is more likely to turn out true. At that point, doesn’t it seem more rational to believe in the 90 % of scientists even though we can’t fully verify their findings?

Look up those like John Casey and theories that use real science and facts. Or look up Maurice Strong, the Club of Rome and their involvement in using the the environment as a way to extract money from the Industrialized nations in this major scam.

A comment can be read here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3012507/ It is a direct comment on Anderegg. I am not entirely sure how credible this is, but they seem at least affiliated with PNAS, and the paper you mentioned can also be found there. TL;DR I remain unconvinced that a consensus exists, but even if true, at ten percent disagreement that would be hundreds, if not thousands of learned men disagreeing with the narrative. That seems sufficient ground for doubt, even if 9 times as many disagree with them, and insufficient unity to call the matter settled.

Climate change is a fact sinds the beginning of this planet, changed billion of years by nature, and whooooooeee there are humans,....they have the power to regulate the temperature of this planet, and we can do with the climate whaat we want!

There are a lot of really good scientific rebuttals to both the models the climate change proponents use and to their scientific methodology. Many of them easily found here on You Tube or go to http://www.therightclimatestuff.com/ . Political parties around the world have sunk a tremendous amount of money and political capital into the notion of climate change and the economic control that carbon taxes will give them, despite the fact that even scientists who are proponents of climate change generally dismiss the idea that these taxes and their alleged reduction of human produced CO2 will have any actual effect on the climate.

UgjDD2dx_BK1ZXgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-FtyO74Lmod9Il6T		9	2015-06-09 02:56:33	Mary Carolyn Kane	@Torran Stewart NO. Just, sweet baby Jesus no. Stop letting these words fall out of your mouth. Global IS NOT because the Sun is getting hotter at all. It is that the atmosphere is retaining heat more than it normally would. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere usually keep the Earth nice and warm and perfect for life as we know it to exist. And, since the Earth maintains a sort of homeostasis on its own, this tends to remain pretty constant and if a natural disaster, like a volcano, happens it can correct it. The problem is, the correction process takes centuries, if not millenia, so we don't want to disturb the Earth's homeostasis too much that she(the Earth, I like personifying it if you can't already tell) can't fix it fairly well on her own. Ok so, back to the greenhouse gases I mentioned earlier. We humans are producing greenhouse gases and reducing the things like trees that maintain the Earth's homeostasis. Burning coal and raising livestock produce things like methane and carbon dioxide, which are greenhouse gases. To get land to raise cattle and drill for oil and mine for coal and what have you, we cut down trees. Trees are wonderful. They take in carbon dioxide and release sweet, sweet oxygen. We are cutting these down, reducing the Earth's ability to maintain homeostasis, and adding things for it to fix, and that is why the Earth is warming. The reasons this is super, duper, duper bad are listed in the video.	UCVmzJDAfk5W6ln0wv6kajAw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVmzJDAfk5W6ln0wv6kajAw	1	UgjDD2dx_BK1ZXgCoAEC	blandantey

This is probably because obviously the rate or materials of fusion in the sun would have to change for it to happen. So let's start with fusion rates. I'll admit it changes but not in a fashion that matches global warming. It heats up and cools down in average every 5 years. Not over the last hundred that climate change has been happening. If it had been you would also be blaming the sun for putting extra carbon on the earth somehow even though it is almost 144 million km away. Now for the fuel types if the material of fusion was to change the sun would balloon very quickly and we would all be consumed by the sun also it would have to be about a few million years older than it acts. Hate to be preachy, thank you all.	UCs3gQUtxLT-mpHCy6RmHv7A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs3gQUtxLT-mpHCy6RmHv7A	1	UgjDD2dx_BK1ZXgCoAEC	blandantey

We're just a small part of a vast network of aligned countries (The British Commonwealth). Also, Canada is so vast and cold it'd be hard to take in one war. also, Canada already got invaded by ye guys in 1812. Britain was actually pretty busy fighting NAPOLEON then but they managed to send over some leftovers and mobilize some Canadians and that was more than enough to hold on to Canada. In fact, the original White House and other Washington buildings were burnt down in that war. 	UCzbbb9MPkQW4Kuh9wSHXDzQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzbbb9MPkQW4Kuh9wSHXDzQ	1	UggarRWnj9sUEngCoAEC	TheGreatMoonFrog

If you re bottle is in the ocean then, yes, kind of. theres deep circulation as well also saline exchanges and carbon compensation depths, a lot of factors in play here....i would think of it more like a deep circulating 'conveyor belt' mixing and transporting nutrients by upwelling and downwelling + takes 1000 years to cycle.

THE WORLD IS HEATING UP. You got that? You have been lied to. Humans are causing global warming, and therefore climate change. First of all, solar activity is lower than it was 100,000 years ago when it was at its peak. As Tom Birmingham said, temperatures should be decreasing instead of rapidly accelerating into increases. What is causing this? A major increase of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases. When fossil fuels are burnt, what happens? CARBON DIOXIDE. What is a product of livestock farming? METHANE. What do factories, cars, buses, trains, planes and power stations along with many other human creations emit as waste? CARBON DIOXIDE. Face the scientific facts. What do greenhouse gases in the atmosphere do? Trap heat from the sun. What would an increase in these gases cause? A rise in global temperatures, also called Global Warming. The deforestation of the rainforests of the world to make room for cattle ranches so businesses can make more money is one example of how humans are affecting the world. The massive production of carbon dioxide and methane from this process massively contributes to the increase of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere, and therefore, global warming and climate change. You might think that humans cant cause something as big as climate change with their tiny actions, but you are dead wrong. Small bacteria that lived in the ocean produced so much oxygen via photosynthesis that they caused a massive ice age called "Snowball Earth". You are probably going to pick out any tiny holes in this argument because you, like many other stubborn, ignorant and pertinacious people on this planet who don't want to take responsibility for their actions and refuse the fact that they are causing many people, entire species, and probably the ecosystem of the entire planet harm. Ive wasted my time trying to convince you of the truth, have'nt I?	UCkmpwxej46xbTLm1FUBqd-w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkmpwxej46xbTLm1FUBqd-w	1	UghXpQr8s73AP3gCoAEC	Tom Birmingham

IF you bothered to read my posts, you'd see that I mentioned the natural cycle. I also discussed how burning millenia's worth of stored carbon is not natural and will alter the time tables of a cycle. It's even put in a nice and easy to understand allegory with the water buckets for a guy like you to understand. As for that tidal level you just mentioned, those are tracked for the last 150 years using tidal charts for maritime purposes (you know, so the draft of large cargo vessels didn't get stuck on the shore at low tide)... Well if you managed to just plug those numbers into a simple excell sheet and then graph it you'll see the cumulative increases. it's at a 10% increase per year right now and will be up to a total 7 inch increase from current levels in 20 years. (it's up 10" from the beginning of the charts) .... in 20 years it will be at an annual 1" increase if current growth rates continue and we don't know when the growth rates will level off and a new homeostasis is met. cock sucker.

The climate is in constant flux, and has been long before we were influencing it. The climate has survive large upswings in C02 levels, caused by volcanic eruptions and world war 2 without a problem, it normalizes on it's own. The naive belief that we are the upsetting some magically delicate balance is not supported by chemical measurements and stomata records of C02, or by reconstructions of temperature via ice core and tree ring data. There is no evidence of any runaway greenhouse effect as caused by C02, There are processes which help regulate excess C02, even if it's man made. Plants for example, will take some of it out the atmosphere to spur their growth,	UCdfFILYygvg2KDu3yg9XrTA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdfFILYygvg2KDu3yg9XrTA	1	UghXpQr8s73AP3gCoAEC	Tom Birmingham
UghXpQr8s73AP3gCoAEC.8EUjqskvZnI8F7zFAIoXMY		10	2016-06-15 05:38:09	Tom Birmingham	@Climate Change Is Natural lets say you have a bucket, that fills with a drop of water ever 30 seconds. once the bucket reaches a certain point it tilts over and poors out it contents to begin the cycle again. This is a very basic way of looking at the natural cycle. Now, let's say you have a group that is pooring that dumped water back into the bucket (along with it's natural trickles), it will fill up quicker and cause the cycle to accelerate. That's the scenerio. The previous trickle of water represents the influences on climate change naturally (volcanoes, organisms metabolizing, solar cycles) we are taking all that stored carbon and all that stored methane and dumping, accelerating the process.

People would rather deteriorate the entire planet than have to spend a bit more to keep the air conditioner running. If you make the harmful alternative more expensive, people will be more willing to invest in clean sources of energy.

The scariest thing about this video is the ignorance of so many of the respondents. There are very few subjects in the world that have such an enormous consensus of scientific opinion, and the latest iteration of the IPCC is comprehensive in it&#39;s support of anthropogenic GW. Those of us working on climate change are not doing so to enrich ourselves, in fact it is quite the contrary, we do it despite suffering financial deprivation. Can the same be said of the fossil fuel companies that make up the wealthiest businesses in the world, and that manipulate democratic processes through perverse mechanisms such as campaign contributions? The fact that people who do not derive any financial benefit get sucked in by the total BS espoused by climate denialists scares the hell of of me.         	UCQCHF1qRCsqSKHTI7V7Ze7w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQCHF1qRCsqSKHTI7V7Ze7w	0

(Eiríks saga rauða)—a medieval account of his life and of the Norse settlement of Greenland—it is written, "He named the land Greenland, saying that people would be eager to go there if it had a good name." (Although there is no particular reason to doubt this information, sagas often reflect oral traditions which may or may not be historically accurate.)[7] Thats not a debunk, only a possibility. so lets look at the ice over Greenland. http://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/gisp2-ice-core-temperatures.jpg Yet wiki continues : The Norse established their settlements along fjords (such as the Tunuliarfik and Aniaaq fjords in the central area of the Eastern settlement). Because this was during the so-called Medieval Warm Period, the vegetation there was very different from what it is today. Excavations have shown that the fjords at that time were surrounded by forests of 4-to 6-metre-tall birch trees and by hills covered with grass and willow brush.[8][unreliable source?][9][unreliable source?] The Norse probably cleared the landscape by felling trees to use as building material and fuel, and by allowing their sheep and goats to graze there in both summer and winter. The climate also became increasingly colder in the 14th and 15th centuries, during the period of colder weather known as the Little Ice Age. My local hill is now called "Winter Hill". No irony Winter is a synonym for Vin Tor. Yup. Anglezarke was noted for its wine production. The Upper barn which survives was made by trees of such a size we do not see to this day. http://www.bolton.org.uk/botbint.jpg Hum de-dumbo's :-D	UC4WvlI1LQ6_EEqNrOR8xUxg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4WvlI1LQ6_EEqNrOR8xUxg	1	Ugj185IzLsVu03gCoAEC	Gray Maguire

Is it science if the reason for signing it is purely due to the fact it "looked official"? That's not science, that is bigotry. If they signed without believing what they signed for. Then they have zero credibility. If they did not sign due to knowing it was not "official" and believed the questions then they have zero credibility too. For instance, UK, back in 2009. The media were asking the public questions by showing them a list what political parties wanted to do. Then they chose the best party from thier agenda. By far and away the BNP scored highest. The state propaganda machine using "nazis, fascists" etc. (No proof) has ensured the votes went elsewhere.

Why is hank resorting to so many logical fallacies?   I mean let climate change facts speak for themselves.  Why do we need to insult people who believe differently?  Why can&#39;t you just argue the facts?<br /><br />This isn&#39;t like creationists calling Evolution a theory, this is a very real controversial issue that certain political groups are using to make millions of dollars, and take control over private sectors of industry that in some nations are not meant to be regulated in this fashion.<br /><br />I don&#39;t think ANY sensible person has any issue with being more efficient and trying to minimize our negative effects on the environment.<br /><br />But the solutions offered by the politicians have yet to produce results that benefit anyone but themselves, or hurt the people.<br /><br />How does paying Carbon taxes to Al Gore or some other group solve the problem?<br /><br />The average person might think those taxes and penalties will force companies to be more responsible with their industry, but all it really means is the companies get fined or taxed and YOU the consumer have to pay MORE to make up the difference, meanwhile the company doesn&#39;t change it&#39;s practices.<br /><br />I know I&#39;m late to the party with my reply, but this is the problem some of the most intelligent people have with this.<br /><br />Knowing that politicians have financial and political motivations to push climate change/global warming on us all, means we have to be a bit more cautious about this issue.  Not just how to solve the problem, but how we handle the pressure to make these changes.<br /><br />The same people who are telling the people of the earth that THEY are to blame for climate change, are the very politicians and corporations that ARE responsible for making sure their industries and practices are safe for the environment.<br /><br />People need to wake up, and whether you accept climate change or not, or whether you believe that it&#39;s man made or natural, you need to make sure that the medicine isn&#39;t worse than the poison.

But it is becoming increasingly clear that almost all these changes have occurred either primarily because of changes in atmospheric GHGs such as CO2 and CH4, or the change was significantly amplified due to feedback from changes in atmospheric GHGs. And I am particularly in this because I'm a geologist and palaeontologist. The current change is also clearly due to the change in GHGs, because no other natural variable can explain the trends; the sun has been getting quieter over the past several cycles, volcanoes and ocean cycles are only adding short term variability, etc - or do you have another variable that explains it? The only thing that can explain the rise in energy and temperatures in the recent decades is the rise in GHGs, and their rise is almost all due to human burning of fossil fuels. As for models: they have been amazingly accurate in their predictions, and a lot of our measurements now run along the upper bounds of the predictions. It has actually been the predictions of the climate 'contrarians' like Linzen that have been spectacularly wrong: http://skepticalscience.com/comparing-global-temperature-predictions.html If you spent a bit of time outside of the WUWT echo chamber, you would actually realise that your assertion that scientists have admitted the models fails is actually at best a misrepresentation, and worst an outright lie.

I re-examine a lot of my understanding of science topics all the time, in fact this week I've had to change my mind on two things because newer and better information came to hand. Your problem is that all the common points you raise against anthropogenic global warming have long since been shown to be flat out wrong, and the fact that you still refuse to re-examine your own biases in favour of your own narrative makes you a text-book science denier. Just because you faithfully dig your heals in against the mainstream scientific consensus does not make you a maveric or a Galileo, it makes you a science denier. I know it hurts to be on the wrong side of science, but you'll need to face it one day. Yes there are major debates within the climate science community about AGW, but none of the debates involve the deniers' assertions. Just like there are major controversies within the evolution community, but not a single one concerns any creationist factoid.

Ironically the reality is the exact opposite of yours: The real scientists are continuously confirming the upper end of estimates about anthropogenic global warming, yet in the media (led by Murdoch's empire) almost everything is spun the way you are asserting - which says a lot about where you get your self confirming views from. I have frequent contact with numerous climate scientists who all confirm that it is as bad, if not worse, as what is reported. Aside from these, I also work with geologists and palaeontologists - you know, those that supposedly confirm that climate has always changed, so no worries - and they are all (ignoring nut jobs like Ian Plimer and Bob Carter) equally certain that what we are seeing at the moment is not a natural trend, and there is lots to worry about.

You should expose yourself to debates and congressional minutes of those rare occasions when the proponents are forced to answer the supposedly non existent skeptics questions. They are completely slayed by facts. Tead the non-governmental Climate Report that uses the same source data as the IPCC but in it's honest totality and meaning from the mouths of the people who collected the data and not the UN political mouthpieces. Use your own observations and that of your family and history. The proponents claim that we are having worse storms and more frequent ones, but it's simply not true. THey claim polar bears are dying, not true, the claim that glaciers are getting smaller, well duh, should they get bigger? they are relics of an ice age. You do not need to depend on the skeptics arguments to find the truth of AGWT. The proponents theories defeat and disprove themselves to anyone who doesn't swallow them whole without thought. Think about each claim, each prediction. And judge it on it's own merit. Then you will have your answer. They are infantile non scientific hypochrosy's designed to create an emotional response. But even a glimmer of actual sentient thought shows them to be shallow and transparent, and it's no secret that the models used to make the claims have ALL FAILED. I can't stress that enough. CO2 has increased in the last few decades, and the GLobal Mean temp. has not., and the predictions said that temps would be much hotter and the effects much more noticable than anything that we can measure. We are experiencing normal cyclic trends, mostly in the opposite of the predicted direction. A net gain of Nil. You want data, it's EVERYWHERE. I cannot help you open your eyes by MY opinion that you can joust all day long. I can only encourage you to try to look at skeptic material and proponent material, as I did, and determine who is more consistent, more stable, more factual, more accurate in modeling and predictions, less prone to corruption, lies and exaggeration. Then make up your own mind, and don't tout my horn or be on my side, be on the side of the truth, the honest common sense truth.

They want economic slaves who live in a very simple, relatively unpopulated society. Think about what that means for a few moments. And as far as us, well they want us to fund their Utopian society, the Climate has nothing to do with it, because we could all die tommorow, or triple our CO2 output, and neither case would affect the temperature anywhere a single degree and anybody that can perform simple math can know this with very little research. I have done massive research in this area and still have come to one unavoidable conclusion. Climate change is a normal process that humanity has very little to do with.

The global warning models regarding CO2 have not only failed, and all predictions failed, but remarkably and utterly failed. CO2 doesn't cause warming even a fraction as much as natural warming makes conditions conducive to more CO2 naturally being created. CO2 is a by-product of a very healthy eco-system, and when the normal trends are warmer, there is always more CO2 because of the warmth, not the other way around, at least not in a driving way. CO2 has increased over the last 20 years, but the global mean temperature has remained stable. I realize this isn't reported much, but it is the empiracal truth that even the climate mongers have admitted. They just don't admit it very loudly and you'll never see it on the 5 O'Clock news, because it is not "politically correct" and either they are pushing the agenda, or afraid to lose clients and advertisers if they contradict it. This isn't science, it is a power struggle. Climate change is just the newest version of global fearmongering that used to be global warming that used to be global cooling (they wanted a BTU tax back then).

I don't think Carbon Taxes fix the problem and only create worse ones for everyone. I think an outright limit or ban is the only solution and of course that could be done in stages or over the period of a decade or more to make sure industry and power generation has time to respond.  That won't happen however because: A:  The liberals are all pushing for Carbon Taxes (Read Profit). B:  The Neocons are in bed with the guilty corporations and are being paid to keep any and all such regulation (including carbon taxation) off the table. This means the public is inundated with propaganda that either stresses how guilty we all are (meaning Carbon Taxes are the right answer), or that Climate change is totally not an issue (Meaning no or little regulation of any sort). IMHO Climate change IS real, and while I hesitate to say HUMANS are significantly to blame for it or not, I think it's pretty clear that humans are recking the environment in general, and even as a libertarian, or maybe especially because I am libertarian, that means that is something the government has the authority to get in the middle of and put a stop to. Just like I said before about the restaurant and how it dumps garbage, it's reasonable for a nation, state, or local country etc to just ban or limit pollution. A Power plant dumping greenhouse gases is IMHO no different from a Restaurant dumping garbage in the street. Sprinkling perfume on it doesn't count... We need real solutions. And No... Nuclear IMHO isn't one of them.  Fukushima proved that to me.  So long as there is even a small chance they could melt down and wreck large swaths of land (entire hemispheres even), there are better alternatives. There is such a thing as clean coal, and there are ways to improve how much energy we consume. But the other problem is, they won't tell you how to consume less energy, because they won't profit from it as much as they will by taxing you.  There is a guy named Cody Lundin, his house is so environmentally friendly it's ridiculous and it looks amazing and is every bit as easy to build (easier IMHO) than just about any other design. Instead of the big above ground boxes that are horrible at efficiency, what if we all lived in houses like his suitable for our climate? Well for one thing a lot of the power plants would go out of business LOL.	UCG8-beA1hy5VHJyJpdqHjig	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG8-beA1hy5VHJyJpdqHjig	1	Uggqkd7Ik6VTtXgCoAEC	D.H. Thorne

A union that allows nations to remain soveriegn but requires all united nations to adopt a form of limited constitutional government where the people rule themselves and the global unions role is not to rule the people, but enable them to rule themselves.  Then, and only then will I gladly embrace a united earth.

TLDR.  Having skimmed your pedantic reply, it's pretty clear that you are trying very hard to make this about me... to the point where frankly I don't really care what you have to say about how I express myself anymore. Judging by the responses to what I wrote, I have clearly garnered more support from those reading this. So in my final reply to you, either stick to the issue of climate change, or go suck an egg... I don't know where you live, but I live in the USA.  So my opinion on hot to solve this issue is primarily structure for US politics.  If you live in Australia, or Sweden, or Africa, you have your own country, your own rules, and my solutions won't necessarily work for you. Maybe where you live, carbon taxation would create a booming new industry and economy and you would end up killing two birds with one stone... But not in America. I am a die hard Minarchist Libertarian.  That means I prefer to keep Government, especially big Government (read Federal) as far away from issues like this as possible.  That being said, assuming Climate Change is as big an issue as we both agree it is... and assuming mankind is at least partially responsible for it (I think we are), if we then also agree that it's a pressing concern (IE a dire emergency). Then I do believe there is a very important role the government can play in helping to solve the issue. Mandating a regulation that BANS outright certain pollutants, or limits emissions, and gives industry a time frame to comply is both REASONABLE and well within the constitutional limits of the federal government.  In fact, it's already been done with Leaded Gasoline decades ago.  The smog in LA and Houston used to be VERY VERY BAD.  Since leaded gasoline was limited/banned, the problem has been more or less resolved. Why should we resort to Carbon Taxes, when we have a very viable solution that has already been used many times before? Carbon Taxes have a very low chance of success, and create a HUGE niche for lobbies and corporations to make billions either in direct kickbacks, or due to helping write the tax regulation to benefit them more than the competition. In the end the consumer is the one who pays the bill, and while that may sound just fine to you... It's not fine with me. Lets put this another way: When you eat at a restaurant, if the restaurant dumps it's garbage into the street to save money, do you just tax the restaurant in the hopes it will clean up it's act?  Or do you make it illegal? Both are just as likely to run the company out of business... The clear answer is you make the behavior illegal as every town and city in the world has done. Any fines they attach to that are (hopefully) based on recouping the costs of the administration that deals with keeping the law enforced.  A Power plant, or Factory is no different... The premise is the same, we don't let every day businesses pollute our environment, why do we let these others? We don't TAX a restaurant.  We fine or shut them down. So whats the difference between a carbon tax, and just making it illegal outright? The former creates an incentive to never end the problem, just profit from treating it. The latter doesn't profit at all.   Fines and other penalties are supposed to be written such that it is in NO ONES interest to collect those fines or penalties. Carbon Tax however is very different.   The More you collect in Carbon Tax, the more you can invest in clean energy, the more value the Carbon credits have and more the controllers of the Carbon Credits and owners of Clean energy make. This creates an incentive for these groups to NEVER solve the problem. Just like it's not in Big Pharma's best interest to cure diseases... Just like it's not in the interest of Haliburton for the Troops to ever finish the war on terrorism, Just like winning the war on drugs would never profit the privatized prison system. The end result is, you and I pay more for less, and I get that it's reasonable to argue that it could indeed cut down on Emissions, but not as well as simply banning/setting limits on emissions in the first place. You could set the time frame to be very reasonable based either on a one size fits all 10 year mandate, or some other mandate that caters to different industries. This is where this issue is politicized to death and why there is sooooo much propaganda about this issue out there to the point were nobody can tell whats really going on. This situation will be dealt with eventually, trust me on that one... The problem is, the powers that be havn't figured out how to RIP YOU AND ME OFF yet and so they are still battling for the hearts and minds of the average person. With one side saying Climate change is BS, the other saying it's not. Why is it that NOBODY is willing to risk limiting or banning them, but everyone is all for Ignoring the issue or forcing people to be taxed over it... Madness... Then Here comes Hank, claiming to be talking to us straight about the issue, and proceeds to parrot every guilt inducing fear mongering piece of propaganda the leftists try to use to scare people into accepting BAD solutions. Then the Robotic Righties come in, full of their own "Climate change isn't real" propaganda that they themselves are merely parroting... Convenient then that nobody is really talking about solutions one way or another... Or if they are, it's only in passing or just another "WE NEED CARBON TAXES!" type rant. Well I tried to make the discussion about more than just fear tactics to make you accept Carbon Taxes.  I tried to make people see that there is more Politics going on in the world of Climate Change, than Science or conservation. The sooner people realize that (IE wake up) the sooner the propaganda stops and people settle down to actually supporting policy that best suits their nation in dealing with the issue. If you think that Carbon Tax is good for your country, good for you... But it's a bad idea for the US... I will never agree to it... even if the alarmists are right and by the time my kid is my age NY has the same climate as the everglades. Not when we can (and have) just Ban or limit the shit in the first place... No way am I lining the pockets of offshore multinational groups salivating at the mouth for global carbon Taxation to be adopted by the civilized world. Al Gore has enough houses already... Yes, that was a joke.  Deal with it.	UCG8-beA1hy5VHJyJpdqHjig	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG8-beA1hy5VHJyJpdqHjig	1	Uggqkd7Ik6VTtXgCoAEC	D.H. Thorne

As I note later on, it is a common strategy of those who do something to claim that the other person is doing it so as to paint both with the same brush.  I suggest, thus, that you were trolling the comment thread, hoping that someone like myself would respond. ****** "Wow... a quote miner" ... and yet the first thing you do is quote me back. "You can't even formulate a coherent sentence.  ... but frankly, when I read your reply. All I see is a person who is looking to be a troll." ... says the fellow who decides to throw a period in the middle of their sentence (and even capitalizes the first word of the next sentence!)  And if you may, if the sentence I used was incoherent, please point out in what way it was.  You asked for better discussion but your response used sound bites ... that's not a discussion, hence you asked for something but were unwilling to do it, thus you were being hypocritical. Please list the assumptions I have made about you personally. (Answering your questions, rhetorical or otherwise) ****** It means you are being hypocritical. Yes you are wrong to assume most people are ignorant. Many of the problems we have with in the world are not due to ignorance, but intransigence, where people are unwilling to change what they do because it would cost them too much (power, money, etc.). What one deems to be propaganda usually depends on which side of the argument one is on, as the one unwilling to rely on the facts has no choice but to use it and call the other a propagandist; it is a common practise to claim your opponent is doing exactly what you are doing. If you reduce the subset from 'people' as you  seem to be primarily using it to refer to most people, and instead restrict it to 'some people', you could reduce your argument to say that if two people need to wake up about an issue, your statement would be useful and helpful. I am neither perfect nor do I believe that nobody can make mistakes.  As noted above, you can reduce your intended audience to just two people who could make those mistakes, but the likelihood of reaching them through this venue is low. Yes I am suggesting that carbon taxes force companies to be more environmentally friendly.  At least trying to reduce their carbon footprint (as one can have a small carbon footprint but be environmentally unfriendly and vice versa). Yes that is it. It would be helpful to point out the logical fallacies because you seem to be able to detect them, and thus can both warn others against them and encourage the author to revise their work to remove them. Taxing the corporation for specific activities that are contributing to global warming can make them alter their behaviour such that they will be less likely to perform those activities.  Alternatively, it would allow another company that avoids such taxes to be able to win the customer over to their product, so the more environmentally friendly product wins out.  Consider your dirty Hong Kong factory.  If a nation slaps a carbon tax on that product, it will cost more than it used to.  This will reduce customer demand for that product.  A sufficiently large carbon tax would price that TV out of the market.  Certainly the TV that doesn't use as much carbon may cost more to produce before the carbon tax is applied, but the goal of carbon taxes is to include all externalized costs to a product.  If you saw a TV that was $400 and one that was $500, but otherwise the same in quality, you seem to indicate that you would purchase the $400 one.  It wouldn't matter to you, the customer, that the $400 cost $400 before the carbon tax, and the $500 cost $300 before the carbon tax, you only see the end result. ****** Your choice to use swear words has indicated the level of conversation you are actually interested in having, and so, I leave it to you.  Good day.

Thorne	@***** I think I agree with every sentiment, so long as that individual contribution is voluntary and encouraged on a social level (Peer to peer, like you telling me - Hey dem, why don't you plant a tree?... which is ironic, because till I get my degree I work for a family tree nursery hehehe). The one area where I DO sound like a raving lunatic is that I tend to believe in tinfoil hat conspiracies.  I think of it this way, the evidence I see, proves to me that there is some kind of unified conspiracy going on to create a 1 world government and rule the world under an authoritarian technocratic autocracy.  One of the tools they are using is environmentalism.  Which sucks on so many levels it makes me want to scream.  Because on one hand, you have the people who buy into all the green stuff, not realizing how much power they are giving to these monsters, and on the other you have the folks who go to the other extreme (out of spite to no small degree) and believe that man can't harm their environment. Anyway that aspect of the issue isn't one I'm looking to argue, because even if I am wrong and there isn't a global plot going on.  The problem with the politicizing of this issue remains.  It just gets downgraded to mere organized corruption, not global conspiracy. LOL anyway, assuming you aren't laughing hysterically at my tinfoil hat reply, thanks for the polite agreeable comment :)	UCG8-beA1hy5VHJyJpdqHjig	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG8-beA1hy5VHJyJpdqHjig	1	Uggqkd7Ik6VTtXgCoAEC	D.H.

"For someone who is asking for some better discussion, suggesting that "Carbon taxes to Al Gore" is suggesting the kettle is black while being the pot." You can't even formulate a coherent sentence.  What does that even mean?  I mean if I read into it, I figured out that you are trying to imply that I'm a hypocrite for using some witty nods to Al Gore in my reply, but frankly, when I read your reply. All I see is a person who is looking to be a troll. "Also, word to the wise, if someone calls on people to "wake up", there is a good chance that they believe most people are willfully ignorant." You make a lot of assumptions about me on a personal level... But in a way you are right.  I DO think many, maybe even most people are ignorant.  The willful part is a big variable, but I think many of them are willfully so yes.  Am I wrong to assume that many people are ignorant to the big picture of what is going on around them? If most people are NOT ignorant, why do we have so many problems in the world that revolve around people being ignorant?  Do you disagree that many base their reactions to complex issues like this on gut instinct or worse, propagandized information and do not actually look at both sides of an issue? Telling people in general to wake up is a figure of speech, it only has a negative tone if you want it to.  I didn't say "YOU David need to wake up."  I said "People need to wake up."  Do you disagree that some people need to wake up to the truth that is all around them?  I had to wake up to the truth of a lot of issues.  Everyone does.   Or are you perfect or do you believe nobody can make mistakes or be ignorant? "meanwhile the company doesn't change it's practices" ... yes, increasing the cost of doing business has never changed the way that companies do things /sarcasm. Uhm... I presume you are intending to suggest that carbon taxes force companies to be more environmentally friendly? Is that it?  While it is true that some do... In most cases, they just absorb the costs by passing the cost on to the consumer.  Either by making YOU pay for the carbon tax by raising the cost of the product.  OR Making you pay for the new improvements to the way they do business by again, increasing cost of the product. You are aware that in most cases the corporations most guilty of polluting and causing so many of these ecological problems, are behind the same people who write the regulations right?  They make these fines so smaller industries can't survive getting fined or taxed, and yet the big corporation can easily absorb the costs. "If you're looking to be helpful, instead of just saying "so many logical fallacies", make a post time marked with the fallacies he is making." How would that be helpful?  It would be a waste of time and only useful from an anecdotal perspective.  My entire point (which you conveniently ignored just to troll me) was that whether you accept Anthropogenic Climate change or not, it is entirely reasonable to expect people to do the right thing for the environment, but also to be careful about what solutions we choose to solve the problems pollution causes. The politics of Climate Change are absolutely despicable, both those who act like they are trying to stop it (Al Gore for example), and those who profit from destroying the environment (Big oil etc). The average person is lost in a mess of propaganda and ultimately nothing is being done about the actual problem! Climate Change is real!  That much is a fact.  However how extreme it's effects will be and how much of a role humans have in the process is still being debated. This means we NEED to be careful about how much of the propaganda we drink regardless of the source. Hank included. Not everyone claiming to be fighting for the environment has your (or the worlds) best interest at heart.  Trust me on that.  The ones who point their fingers at YOU are the first ones you need to suspect as being full of shit.  The most they can blame you for is being a consumer.  It's not your fault how industries make products, or how much your car pollutes things.  Sure you can do things at home like limit hot showers, and use less electricity.  But thats just good common sense!  Those who don't keep these energy uses low, pay more already as it is.  But making me pay more for a TV because some company in Hong Kong uses a dirty factory to make them, doesn't make me buy less TV's or look for more environmentally friendly factories.  I'm already looking for the most efficient appliance I can to keep my bills low.  So how will taxing the company, who then raises the cost of my TV solve the issue? Please, explain that to me. In detail.  Otherwise, go fuck off... Stroking your intellectual Ego by quote mining and nit picking my comment is just mental masturbation... go jack off somewhere else.

"Plus eating meat and driving car is at leat useful. But waste some years of your life to care about whining screaming, shitting, dumb creature only because it has half of your genes?

Wow, you really hate animals, dont you? :o I think they are not useless dirt - they are pretty much like us, compared to anything else in the universe (Plants, Stones, Fluids, Plasma, EM-Waves, Dark Matter etc. lol ^^) They can feel and want to be free, they have several emotions and some kind of (body) language; what else you know does that fit to?   Ps.: Would you enjoy to be treated like dirt by a creature 100x more intelligent than you?  Ps2.: Yes, you actually need a lot of ignorance, poverty or an uneducated mind to have more than 3 kidzz.

Ugiq_m67Q1QnSngCoAEC.7-H0Z7-7lwL7-QQFwfC7lI		1	2014-07-27 02:03:14	Kate S	Really? You think human being can avoid bringing any damage to planet? No. Now, there are already too many people, so every human, who consumes at least some resources, is already a damage. Especially, if a peson lives in developed country, uses at least some electricity, at least sometimes goes on plane etc. By adding new people, we add more beings, who will do all that damage, which is hard to compensate. It is like doubling your own damage to ecology. And to compensate one average person's damage one need to plant not a tree, but thousands of trees. If you see all humans, who say, they do it better to ecology, know that they are liars. Just sum up all damage they cause, by consuming any resources, by breathing and releasing CO2, by using electricity etc. And then sum up all their "activism". And compare. You will not find a person who compensates ALL his harm. There is noone like that on the entire planet. Yes, people can be good and have good intentions, and try to be less harmful to the environment. But we cannot fight our own nature. Each individual makes its own portion of harm. We cannot reverse process entirely already. We can just try to minimise harm we bring. And best way to do it is to minimise number of new people by breeding less. P.S.: Anyway, any person who has more than 3 kids, is in my opinion, either very rich or very stupid.

Basically, it's a complex system of many contributing factors which can easily be researched. I'm no climate scientist so I can't really provide more than that besides saying that there's plenty more accredited scientific papers out there supporting this idea than ones opposing it.

Let me ask you a question, if a terrorist group existed that killed everyone who owns a 4x4, would you buy one? Also if the same terrorist group executed the heads of every car company that has not produced an electric vehicle, what would the next head do? Probably invest in better security. What if next the terrorist group, managed to hit their targets again and kill their family? Wow this is getting a bit dark, but wouldn't they start mass producing electric vehicles. Next step would be targeting those who run and work at coal and oil electrical factories.

Humans have the ability to adapt, and frankly we are quite a long way from broiling or freezing. What you should fear is a society so dummed down that the people that see and speak the truth are silenced by a minority with a political agenda because the rank and file citizen will believe anything the government tells them without ever seeing the constant contradictions of logic and a changing story line to more closely match events on the ground.

As an industrial design student who is interested in sustainability and climate change, I've come into contact with new ideas about consumerism and production. Look up the Cradle to Cradle principle; this is actually based on the principle that whatever you take from the environment, you give back to it (and preferably give back more). It's very idealistic and hard to implement, but some companies made considerable progress! So by revolutionizing the way we produce and consume, we would retain our economy while fighting climate change.

UggoMosVxC57IngCoAEC.89Aq4GJiq5k8ETXLj2cvlB		0	2016-05-29 17:57:32	Logan Matthews	@TheDestruct0r In reference to your comment about how many Gt the ocean/land produce in CO2 every year, you're right, kind of. All ocean life and vegetation on earth combined release about 770Gt in CO2 every year, and humans only produce about 30, but that 770 is part of a natural cycle. That 770Gt of CO2 gets absorbed by organisms that need it to survive, and they in turn release oxygen, and organisms that need that to survive consume that and release CO2, and the cycle repeats. However, the 30Gt that we're throwing into that equation throws off the equilibrium of that cycle. It's 30 more Gt than the cycles can account for and recycle naturally. So a lot of it gets trapped in the atmosphere. When you look at it that way, we are most definitely the single largest producer of CO2, not counting the entire global ecosystem as a producer.

So no, humans are not even close to the largest C02 producer. Methane is a 3-4x more effective green house gas than C02. Have the methane levels been rising? How much methane is produced by humans and how much by nature? Seems like its a very important variable that seems to be missing from the IPCC reports and predictions.

Here is an example of how you havent looked up any facts and how little any of you actually know about weather. Without googling, how many of these questions can you answer? 1)What are the top 5 factors, that influence temperature on earth, the ones that meteorologists use when predicting weather. 2)What percentage does each one those factors account in our modeling? For example; in a computer model for weather prediction how important is knowing the amount of water vapor in an area, does it account for 10% or 90% of the final value after all the calculations are made? 3)Whats the biggest contributor of CO2 to earths atmosphere. 4)What percentage of the atmospheric gases does CO2 account for? Is CO2 1% of the air or 10% 5)Of all the total CO2 added to the atmosphere every year what percentage of that total is human made? 6)Name the top 3 green house gases in order from the most abundant in the atmosphere to least abundant. 7)How much heat can each of the top 3 green house gases absorb relative to each other? Like does CO2 hold 2 or 3 times more heat than the other main green house gases? 8)Is human made CO2 also the cause of the global warming trend on Mars?

Pieter was using a lot of climate data in his research when the global warming media blitz was started by liberals. 	UCI7A79xr_gcNBZ-MpnTuWAw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI7A79xr_gcNBZ-MpnTuWAw	1	UggwaVtN1KwPKHgCoAEC	Clark Magnuson

Just because 90% of papers submitted for review are not published does not mean that the reason they are not published is to support an agenda. It doesn't mean they are not either, of course, but extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Most unpublished papers do not meet publishing quality, they are flawed when put under peer review, or they cover a topic that was covered much more completely by a prior paper. 	UCkNTgb3lsZJ6HPe00-lpyAg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkNTgb3lsZJ6HPe00-lpyAg	1	UggwaVtN1KwPKHgCoAEC	Clark Magnuson

You use the term 'warmer?' as if it is some sort of slurr for the mentally deficient, spit on the entirely unrelated political positions of others, and accuse a massive and varied body researchers of marching in perfect lockstep to support a global agenda among a cabal of nation states that is in direct contradiction to their observed behavior. People should not be disrespectful, I'd go so far as to say especially on the internet where they should have time to cool off before posting a reply, but respect and basic courtesy must go both ways. Please everyone be mindful of that.  Now back to the commentary.    You mention that the seal level rise has been one meter in one thousand year. But 20%-30% of that change has been in the last century and the lions share has occurred since the beginning of human industrialization and mass deforestation efforts began. Why does this refute the theory that we are affecting the climate rather that supporting it?  You mentioned that we should be happy if Greenland thaws. But why do you believe that the end state of any climatic shift will be favorable to humans? The climate system is meta-stable, which is to say self regulating up to a point, push it past that point of no return and we don't actually know what will happen. This has been seen in the past when suitably drastic shifts have propagated and regulating factors pushed far enough begin to break down and even become accelerating factors.    But probability is that the end conditions will be less favorable to us simply because we are reliant on a very complex system of agriculture and water transport with far more failure states than favored states, that is an inherent quality of ANY complex system.

I don't see how it is relevant. We are also interested in extremophile conditions that could allow arsenic or silicon based life to be viable for the simple discoveries that it would unlock in chemistry and biology, that has nothing to do with whether such environments would be viable for terrestrial life. And what is this about printing plant DNA? Sounds interesting! Back to the topic! I didn't find anything in the core sample data I looked up to suggest that the Earth average global temperature has been significantly higher since the last glacial period.   Of course there are variations, but that is something common to ALL stable systems, whether they be organic, mechanical, or digital, oscillation around a steady state. So without filtering the data and looking for trends you could really make any point you like about any small batch of years.  Your reasoning seems circular here. Are you saying that the claims of global warming are fabricated entirely for political agenda? Climate Change is definitely politically contentious, but popular opinion jumping all over a field of scientific endeavor or trying to use it to win votes is nothing new and does not add or detract from the merits of the science which must always speak for itself.  I hate to bring it out because it gets used like a cudgel, but Isn't it improbable with such a high level of consensus among climatologists that there could be some sort of conspiracy? I mean, climatologists are like other people, they span the political spectrum from liberal, conservative, to communist, to libertarian and anarchist, and there is plenty of money being funneled into climate research from both liberal and conservative sources, yet the consensus remains that it is happening and that it is caused by humans.    So if there was serious scientific evidence in opposition to the position of climate change, shouldn't we see something like a larger and more organized opposition? Counter theories seeking funding? Anything? I mean, the Oil Companies alone offer tremendous amounts of money to climate related causes, but instead of attempting to refute the science, their funds go to advertising agencies.  So can't the very same argument based on political motive be made that a campaign is being waged to suppress the consensus position on ACC and shore up bad science to the contrary? I look forward to your response.	UCkNTgb3lsZJ6HPe00-lpyAg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkNTgb3lsZJ6HPe00-lpyAg	1	UggwaVtN1KwPKHgCoAEC	Clark Magnuson

The process of reducing the population would likely be painful; people would certainly have to work well into old age. Those who have a strong sense of ethics might choose to forego any but palliative medical care after the age of 70. ("Atlantic" magazine published an article by a doctor who has chosen this path.) I myself am contemplating this choice, and I am in my mid-sixties. ... The reduction of world population to one billion is a fantasy. I believe, however, that the proposed colonization of Mars is a more fatuous fantasy, yet people talk as if it were realistic.

IPCC is funded by all governments around the world. It would be very difficult in that case to satisfy each of their political agenda, assuming that there are. Regardless, their conclusion over the fact that climate change is man-made does not change throughout a long period of time.  Regardless, funding does not mean that there is a political agenda behind it. Science does not operate on political agenda as you think. Each paper is peer reviewed and tested repeatedly by scientists around the world. The computer doesn't lie. The raw data doesn't lie. Only think tanks like the CATO institute post bunch of subjective articles based on personal opinions. These authors only use their PhD in a certain field to support their view that the climate change doesn't exist. On the other hand, 99% of all scientific papers (literally) supports the conclusion of man-made climate change. The rest of the 1% point towards the sun and other stuff (note that they don't deny that it exists), which are disproven multiple times. I hate to repeat this multiple times, but intention does not dictate the validity of an argument. If the conclusion that a side has is logical and based on evidence, then the argument is still valid.

Please don't use these examples as ways to invalidate the evidences that are out there. Again, I suggest you look at the evidences that are out there. Science isn't political; it doesn't have a political agenda. Things like IPCC, NASA, and other organizations provide raw data and data analysis to help inform the public about these issues.  So far, there is a 97% consensus among climatologists, and more than 80% among scientists of all fields, including geologists, meteorologists, oceanographers, etc. HOWEVER, I suggest you to look at the data and conclusions to inform yourself and come up with your own opinion. This is so that you can come up with the most unbiased view for yourself.   Look for papers, not random articles. http://www.ipcc.ch/ http://climate.nasa.gov/	UChgbO60fCghg5kNQnoU7iuw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UChgbO60fCghg5kNQnoU7iuw	1	UghCjEK3hZ0n0HgCoAEC	Gentleman Warfighter

I don't buy more than I need. It's basically not living an extravagant lifestyle and cutting back on wastes. However, what defines "extravagant" and "frugal" is of personal opinion. For Bill Nye riding Air Force One to tell other people about this, the impact could be more than the CO2 released from the jet. For one, he could be discussing with the president about ways the US can change its looks on changes for the betterment of the environment. Second, he could be riding with the president to a specific conference about this issue. This provides exclusive access to him, and the media coverage could bring more attention from the public.

Most of the things in landfills take up roughly hundreds or even thousands of years to decompose. For plastics, it's ten thousand years.  Although you're right that they're returned to the ground, the time it takes to return it to the cycle takes up way too much time. In the mean time it's decomposing, we harvest new trees and destroy more habitats. These resources are needed in the natural process, and lacking these resources because we harvest them cripples these cycles.

The problem is, we dispose them in landfills and the used resources go unused for tens of thousands of years.  Theoretically, if we have 100% recycling for all used materials, then overpopulation would be no problem. However, this is definitely not the case now, and we are not recycling a lot. If we increase recycling, then the capacity of this planet to hold lives would increase as well.

The planet does tend to maintain a certain "balance" though. The planet probably doesn't feel threatened by climate change. It's the LIVING THINGS that are in jeopardy right now, including the human race. Change is happening too fast for the earth to keep the balance. And as a result LOTS of organisms are struggling to adapt to the new environment. And to make things worse for everyone, we are taking away earth's ability to regain the original wonderful balance. Like, we cut down the rainforests. And we destroyed the ozone layer. Yes, the planet will adapt... it will probably regain its balance someday. But in the process we probably will have gone extinct. You see, we can't adapt to extreme climates. So I think we'd have a better chance of survival if we try our best to not throw this current balance off.

The earth gets progressively more and then progressively less energy from the sun during these cycles. As solar energy increases this releases more CO-2 by heating the oceans and this traps more heat. This feedback cycle warms the earth and then, after many thousands of years, as solar input decreases, the CO-2 is gradually absorbed by the oceans and the earth cools down again.

What you are missing is that the anthropogenic theory is such that what has happened in the last two decades cannot exist with the simultaneous increase in CO2 at the levels that exist. If they are right, and they cannot be, then the last two decades could not have happened. We are not arguing against global climate change, change over time, or natural increasing or decreasing trends.

Global warming started more than two decades ago, and the warming didn't.  If we look closely, I believe we'll see that the average global temperatures have NOT stopped going up.  They, in fact, continue to go up as we speak.  They just haven't gone up as fast as some of the estimates of some of the scientists predicted. The earth is big man, it takes time for all the energy to balance out.	UCwmKx9LibbQO67n5_BU5UMg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwmKx9LibbQO67n5_BU5UMg	1	UggeZwu0IWoPy3gCoAEC	The Matt

There are tools that measure conditions, like the heat in the oceans at different depths, the total radiation that hits the earth from space, and the total amount that leaves it, etc.  These tools gives us data over decades, this data is used to determine the state of the climate. Simply looking out of your window on a given day may or may not give you an accurate indication of your region's climate conditions, or future climate.

The only time a few do is in their districts they know their constituents care about it and they use it only for campaign reasons, not for actual issue. And that list of yours?

I'm just not swallowing what the u.n. or the U.S. government is spoon feeding us. Our politicians most certainly have millions of their own $$ invested in this "green energy" and all this talk about how "we must act now," should make anyone suspicious. 1. Largest drop in in average temps in 100 years in 2013. 2. It snowed in Egypt for the first time in like 100 years and some areas of the Middle East got snow for the first time ever. 3. The Great Lakes had the highest amounts of ice in 20 years and coldest winter on record. Lakes still frozen in May. 4. The coldest spring in150 years in MN and other states. 5. 5-7 degrees cooler in parts of the midwest. 6. There are unregulated weather modification programs going on in the U.S. and all over the world. Not a lot of talk about those facts and when there is, they'll try to spin it; say it's because of global warming.

With freedom comes the risk of bad players. We both agree that that is what the laws are for, but you think that regulation and Capitalism are opposites on opposite sides of the spectrum with the middle ground somewhere in between. They are not opposites no matter what your liberal professor told you. I beseech you to go look for yourself, in the dictionary. Capitalism represents the freedom of commerce, the ability to benefit from the sweat by having the freedom to exchange and trade the fruits of your labor for the fruits of someone elses labor. The opposite of that is not over-regulation, but communism. Both systems have varying degrees of regulation, but pure Capitalism just means pure free market basically. And it can be free and still be regulated with laws selected and enforced by the people of that market. The difference is that in communism, the polar opposite, there is no free market. Everything is engineered to work, by people who cannot come close to the success and intuition of a fluid, instantly reacting market based on peoples actual needs. There is in fact much more evidence of abuse where there is a lack of Capitalism, in the last century millions of people in Russia were starved to death because they did not have a Capitalist system, a free market, were not allowed to keep the fruit of their labor, or trade for what they needed. They were exterminated because the government controlled everything. Regulations had nothing to do with either scenario. Capitalism is economic freedom, and I think we both agree that common sense regulations to prevent crimes are necessary. But good regulation does not impinge the economic freedom, just the criminal who abuses it.

And it was the removal of pure capitalism that solved them. GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS PUSHED FOR BY THE PEOPLE is what ended most child labor (except in Tobacco industry, because apparently there's a loop hole there) and ended locking people in their workplace or a slew of other things.  Face it, you're wrong. Pure capitalism requires NO regulations to interfere with businesses, but "regulated capitalism" or a "mixed economy" is basically capitalism with sensible regulations. Regulations that assure competition (which means trust busting as well as ease of start up). The reason pure capitalism can't require regulation is because then that puts more power into the public in how a business is run, that goes against the idea of capitalism which is about purely "private" ownership/control. You seriously have no idea what you're talking about, like most idiots in the US who are libertarians or so and think they know economics properly. Also fail history, after all, the time we had the most regulations and the highest taxes on the rich and corporations (and no, there weren't the loopholes of today back then) was when we had our greatest economic growth. That's because the way to get around paying as much in taxes for the rich/corporations was to reinvest their money into businesses so it couldn't be taxed. That helped people have higher paying jobs (proportionally) to today which gave more people disposable income which created more people demanding products which created more of a need for supply which created more jobs. If there's little to no disposable income for the majority of a nation, then the economy suffers. Supply side economics is a failure, Milton Friedman and other libertarian/conservatives and their "trickle down" bullshit is over and proven wrong.  So ya, what about history and reality? How, when we had higher taxes on the rich/corporations, higher regulations, and less influence of politics by corporations (don't get why you right wingers love corporations so much, even giving multi-national corporations power in our government through donations), do you ignore reality so god damn much and how it was our greatest period of economic growth?

It was people in a free society who made laws to prevent abuses. Capitalism can work with or without regulation, and I think most capitalist agree that some structure of the free market is absolutely effective at making the free market work more smoothly. Your calling out my education when your statement equating pure Capitalism to no regulation is a complete falsehood and joke. And when socialism is forced, then it is authoritarian, and I would argue that creating an unsustainable economy that leeches success to pay for failure has a very finite shelf life, which at the end of that life runs out of success to rob, having choked it out, and then comes the forced authoritarianism to MAKE it work, only it still doesn't. This is why the end game of socialism, with very few exceptions is some form of authoritarian tyranny, such as we are starting to feel right now. The fact that you are too dumb to see the two words used together, and think that means that I am saying they are the same thing, says more about your reading comprehension that it does about my education, and we've already established that you are clueless about what Capitalism is. It is what makes any successful economy work, and the fact that kids are taught to demonize it by propoganda factories called schools these days is a sad thing as we lose our rights, freedoms, and see Capitalism and property rights extinguished, and the almost extinguished free market blamed for the results of letting it become less free, and no, freedom does not mean unregulated, it means free, as in there is no too big to fail, and the same rules and rights apply to all, and government does not run it, fluid individuals do. It cannot be preconceived and planned and manipulated, it exists best and at it's optimum level of growth and health when it reacts instantly and autonomously to it's own countless inputs by free individuals and businesses, within the framework of commonsense laws we call regulations that apply equally to all citizens, and are not exempted or subsidized by government agendas.

Again, I state: Here are 4 possible outcomes based on whether we do or don't act and if climate change is real or not. 1) We act, climate change is real, we help stop our planet from dying while at the same time creating new technology that drives new industries that creates jobs. 2) We act, climate change is not real, we at least have created new energy technologies to compete with oil and coal (yay competition). 3) We don't act, climate change is not real, nothing happens in any way. 4) we don't act, climate change is real, our planet changes where it can no longer support human life, we all die. Out of the 4 possibilities, we see that 2 are good, 1 is no change, and the other is bad, really bad.

The Woodfortrees site isn't coded correctly, look at the source code for the website yourself if you know how to read it (I know you don't). The trendline for your 18 years of data you keep holding up isn't accurate on the website, ask Gina to borrow her graphing calculator since she just got out of grade school. Input the data yourself and draw a trendline, Guess what?!?!? Its not a straight fucking line you pitiful fucks. You seriously can't even read a graph or correlate data and the website you all hold up as your "evidence" looks like it was coded by someone with even less brain power than Gina. Btw what happened to Andrew?

Save up your money Nancy and one day you can go and watch the Ice calving in real time, that is if you manage to get enough money in the bank to afford the trip before its all gone and the sea levels rise which we both know isn't going to happen with your financial situation. O the internet, the things you can find. Here are some fun facts for you, a sea wall is already being built in NYC to stave off the rising sea levels that already have cities like Venice underwater for 200 of the 365 days of the year. The Pentagon and the CIA along with basically every other major government have begun making preparations for whats coming, if you have any friends in military with a rank of Colonel or equivalent just ask em. You and your tummy stick friend Andrew can have your OPINIONS all day fucking long, but the science is in and the big boys are already making preparations.

What part of a 10 year or even an 18 year dataset means jack shit do you not understand?  What's hilarious is you aren't even arguing your point correctly anymore but still haven't realized how to interpret the data that you keep posting. A 10% increase in CO2 levels in barely 18 years, is HUGE. If you followed that trendline back to 1790 that would mean over a 220% increase in CO2 levels in the past 224 years or ~1% increase every fucking year. I could break down many tons of CO2 that equates to but I'm sure feeble brain has already given up on reading and is trying to figure out what horseshit you are going to throw at the wall next.

Picking sides is irrelevant. I have no interests in national security or world power. Those who use my money to fund the propaganda machine do. *On Propaganda :* Noticed now they are lying about Putin? If Russia wanted to stop Kiev's soldiers killing more Ukrainian Russians. It would be over in an hour. If you are a Scot and The English army is killing Scots in England (2,200+ dead so far), you would come fighting to their aid, yes? But oh no. Putin is bringing in mercenaries. Geddit? Does not matter. Facts are facts. Whatever words are told, I chose the facts that add up. If CO2 & CH4 were an issue and full and open honesty prevailed, I'd be on your side. But nothing is.

If you think you can get all your fellow skeptics to contribute to building a satellite out of crowd sourced money AND having trained scientists operating it/performing studies and maintaining the functionality of said satellite ALL FOR FREE because I know how you deniers LOVE to say its all about the money, then by all means get to it. Good luck with that Odds are you've never taken a methane data logging device and went near a natural gas storage facility and saw for yourself how much methane is being leaked into the surrounding air. I've personally struck a match near one and the air around the flame was being ignited/combusted in a much more violent and intense way than normally lighting a match would.

Meanwhile nobody can show the slight dent in the air absorption graphs for methane. (Which is levelling off due to the oncoming global cooling). Worse still, they are looking right at the edge of the IR band for this minuscule non-effect. Worse on top! There is no place on Earth where the air is dry enough.

Nothing in their theories can account for it; only lame excuses. The 20 year rise ended almost 20 years ago. So it cannot be CO2 induced. If you imagine you can find an answer, it will stem from an unproven theory with ZERO hard data to back it up. No thermal events anywhere except in "final adjustments to the data" (i.e. excuses and fraud). I'm using their recorded facts here, so no room to squirm. Do you imagine CO2 dropped before it rose. Then they began official records? vwww.woodfortrees.org/plot/hadcrut3vgl/from:1960/to:2005/trend/plot/hadcrut3vgl/from:2000.85/trend/plot/hadcrut3vgl/from:1937/mean:96/plot/esrl-co2/mean:12/normalise/plot/hadcrut3vgl/from:1940/to:1960/trend CO2 is merely an outlier for temperature.

I looked up "Diversity of life and extinction events over geologic time".  I find the number of genera has risen about 300% since the last extinction, there has never been more life on earth. The only time Co2 has been this low is in the Carboniferous to Permian periods and now. All other times Co2 has been much higher. Please make video about another subject you know nothing about so i can make fun of you about something else.

Greenhouse owners pump in Co2 to increase plant growth. Current predictions based on history is that the earth will cool for the next 20-25 years.  Just as we have cooled from the peek temperature year around 1996. No kid in high school today have experienced warming. BTW the warmest period in the last 100 years was in the 30's, then the earth cooled as Co2 rose. Go figure.

The National Guard will not and can not deal with a migration of nearly 100 million people inland on its own. Marshal law is going to be enacted , millions of people are going to die of starvation or dehydration, disease etc.. Its not going to be pretty. The Earth's climate changing has been the cause of (I believe) 4 of the 5 previous MASS extinction events on the planet. Humanity and the industrial revolution in the US/Russia/Europe and now China/India has kick started that process again into full overdrive. Enjoy the next 25-50 years because after it its going to get ugly and very dire for the human species and most of the other mammals on Earth.

Nearly 11,000 peer reviewed articles last year and only 2 of them agree with your opinion Gina. The scientific consensus is in, your opinion doesn't mean jack shit. Your kids have a future of being desperate for food and begging FEMA and the military for handouts during the mass migration of humans that will be coming, that is if they survive that long.

We’re currently experiencing the worst spate of species die-offs since the loss of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. Although extinction is a natural phenomenon, it occurs at a natural “background” rate of about one to five species per year. Scientists estimate we’re now losing species at 1,000 to 10,000 times the background rate, with literally dozens going extinct every day. It could be a scary future indeed, with *as many as 30 to 50 percent of all species possibly heading toward extinction by mid-century*. [...]In fact, *99 percent of currently threatened species are at risk from human activities*, primarily those driving habitat loss, introduction of exotic species, and global warming.[...]" More on : http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/biodiversity/elements_of_biodiversity/extinction_crisis/	UCAftgsfpRkGEm27IVjQI2DA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAftgsfpRkGEm27IVjQI2DA	1	UggpYuOcIzwwGXgCoAEC	Gina Titnaw

If mass extinction happens, it would take hundreds of thousands of years for life to fully recover. By your statements above, you seemed very keen on humans being able to survive, but in order for us to survive in our current social & cultural structure, we are very dependant on other life forms for food and we don't seem to be very keen on cannibalism. As food becomes more scarce, people will turn to anything to get food, and that means war, people have gone to the point of nuclear warfare before, and who knows, we might just be so stupid enough to do it again if it comes down to it. And only a few select species of life forms can survive the radiation levels nuclear warfare would create. Also humans are responsible for many species going extinct that would other wise survive for much longer because of poaching, habitat destruction etc.	UCmM7wKR1pcwLGvJneyx4JHQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmM7wKR1pcwLGvJneyx4JHQ	1	UggpYuOcIzwwGXgCoAEC	Gina Titnaw

Certain cooling stages were triggered because plant life was thriving and soaking up so much Co2 that it caused the earth to go into a cooling stage and cause mass extinction. Certain warming stages were caused by volcanic eruptions, continental movement, or comet/asteroids striking the earth causing a warming stage and again mass extinction. You are right about the earth nearing the end of it's warming stage however we would need to have an event that would cause a big enough shift to start the cooling phase, otherwise temperatures will continue to rise. Also just because humans might be able to survive these climate changes, other species wont be able to, especially marine life. And we humans depend on other life forms to provide us with food. If there are no longer any other plants, land or sea animals for us to eat, we too won't survive	UCmM7wKR1pcwLGvJneyx4JHQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmM7wKR1pcwLGvJneyx4JHQ	1	UggpYuOcIzwwGXgCoAEC	Gina Titnaw

Lol, same tactic, different story, same types lining their pockets with scare money.  Oh and "They didn't need the money to bring up these issues. Scientists are about bringing facts to light, which they already did."  i wonder who said that! Oh you did Jam. lol So modern humans have been around for 200 thousand years, how many times were there hundred year periods warmer than current temperatures?  I count 12 in the past 11 thousand years (Greenland ice cores).  And guess what, humans adapted and thrived and the did it without air conditioning.

No. How time in the geological record (600 million years) does it show Co2 is low as it is today?  One time, 300 million years ago, so is today's low Co2 unusual? Yes, most of the time Co2 is much higher than the 400ppm we see today.  How high? 7000ppm during the Cambrian period, 2500 when the dinos ruled. Now let look at the people the push global warming.  Mann - in 1994 he was a graduate student, today he's worth 45 million, global warming pays well.  James Hansen of NASA, looks like he's under reported 1.6 million in taxes the past 5 years, oops it's hard to keep track of those warming dollars.  Phil Jones of the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit (CRU) - Climategate Professor Phil Jones could face ten years on fraud charges. Keith Briffa a chief contributor to the IPCC report seem to fear the loss of research dollars, as indicated in the climate e mails.  Oh their cash cow may end if the world knew the truth. I could research and post the rest of them but that's boring and the actual data should speak for it self.  The data, No unusual warming, Co2 has gone up while global temperatures have dropped so Co2 does not increase temperatures. Co2 is actually too low and an increase will help support more plant life.	UCPZ8iggXoCQUwgQ2Ek3_ErA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPZ8iggXoCQUwgQ2Ek3_ErA	1	UggpYuOcIzwwGXgCoAEC	Gina Titnaw

Most clean forms of energy generate so little energy you need entire farms of them, wind turbines, photo-voltaic solar, tidal platforms, all cost a fortune and require thousands of hectares to do the same job as a water-heating plant like fossil, nuclear, geothermal or focused solar. Scotland is windy as hell, we are surrounded by sea and get gale-force winds daily, perfect for wind generation, we have some of the biggest wind farms on Earth dotted all over the countryside and at sea, they still produce very little when compared to nuclear.  That I do not mind because even as an advocate of nuclear I prefer 'truly clean' generation, but it is costing us a fortune and it won't have paid for itself for decades.

The plant near me, Hunterston B, has been producing about 17% of Scotland's energy for 40 years and all throughout that time it has been churning out nothing but water vapor. Quite an improvement on the coal plants which caused acid rain that damaged and blackened most of the UK's buildings for 200 years.

They would probably apply the scientific method to process and see what they could possibly do. I agree that yes, it does take more than just "putting gases in the air." You also have to take into consideration that the individuals working to find a way to create an artificial atmosphere would also know that, so they would have find the missing pieces of the puzzle to make a solution.

But are magnetosphere of earth has been weakening as well. NASA confirmed, in fact, ever since solar cycle 24 (started from 2008) is the weakest in 100 years, and in 2013, of what should be 5.5 years of solar maximum, was the growth of the polar vortex over continental land, while the oceans stay warm, and keep coast line warm as well. as far as CO2. as far as we can notice, the only impact by adding more CO2 in the atmosphere is making our trees grow quicker, but our planet has not been warming up for nearly 20 years.

This video is not including all the factors that plays a role on our climate, i.e. solar cycles, weakening magnetosphere, el nino and la nina induced by solar cycles, geomagnetic storms, space weather events, and much more... we can not predict our future climate because we can not yet understand what exactly effects our climate. i already know the "science" behind man made global warming, and how greenhouse gases are the climate driver. but after future research after high school, i find they can not predict climate, as much as they can predict weather events. after conclusion, i find that greenhouse gases are a result of warming and cooling, not the cause, correlation does not mean correlation, if we do have any effect on global temperatures, it is dwarfed by primary cause of our climate. 	UCFth-r5bGjEuL6B1B5Hwh9A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFth-r5bGjEuL6B1B5Hwh9A	1	UgjOkgx0_Y4iFngCoAEC	Joe Festa

Seriously though, I wish people would stop throwing around words. We need more data, not apocalypse BS.<br /> I used to believe in &#39;man made&#39; global warming, and thought it an interesting topic (since it could change our lives dramatically). However, that all changed when I actually started reading scientific studies - suddenly realising how little scientists actually know about our climate. Alongside this, when I see valid scientific studies (not by climate change deniers!) being blocked from publishing or pushed into a corner, and the BS spouted by so-called-scientists, then it&#39;s no wonder I&#39;m not so sure anymore. Of course, if I see valid data, with no variables left unconsidered, proving global warming to be caused by CO2 and methane, then I&#39;m willing to change my mind. <br />This video as it stands is basically BS. The graph is appalling, and all the the guy is spouting is &quot;APOCALYPSE&quot;. No, my friend, you haven&#39;t a clue what you are talking about!

UgieJK_wBfNSaXgCoAEC	0	1	2014-07-22 05:17:32	To The Point	I like how everyone is making the argument &quot;the climate has always changed! look at history!&quot; No one is saying that didn&#39;t happen, ok? I just don&#39;t get how people can honestly say we don&#39;t impact it at all. It&#39;s not the change itself we&#39;re worried about, it&#39;s how much we&#39;re affecting the change. Right now the world IS going through it&#39;s natural cycle. The problem is that we&#39;re PUSHING it in that direction and we don&#39;t know what the outcome of doing this will bring (we have an idea). The Earth isn&#39;t used to something else influencing it, at least not it&#39;s own creatures. It&#39;s been taking care of itself for a while now, but now it has another influence to deal with. Face it, pumping more &quot;atmosphere&quot; into the atmosphere might cause some changes.	UCfy-b49wnXXte6Pvts-EJVA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfy-b49wnXXte6Pvts-EJVA	0

The demand for meat is too high right now, and in my opinion there is no need to consume the excessive amounts of animal products that compose most of western diet. I put it more simple for you: less animal products' consumption equals less animal farming, which leads to less methane emissions (gas that afects ozone layer), less global warming, and hence lesser impact on climate changes. Some bonus derived from this action and vegan way of thinking: less soil and water pollution (from animal manure and other sources...), better health for everyone, less unecassary animal slaughter (no slaughter if all become vegan), and benefits for the environment such as less deforestation and extinction of animal species... All that thanks to "those Tofu Munchers"... By the way, there are many forms of veganism, so not all vegans munch on tofu. Personally, i don't munch tofu, soy, or processed foods.

I know all of these claims are backed by scientific findings, but I really need to see those findings to show him that we are already doing a lot of damage. Not to be all doom and gloom but things like dead zones in the oceans, trash islands, all the species we have driven to extinction, growing deserts etc. I find a lot of people agreeing, but no articles with the numbers and facts.

Wow, how progressive! :D<br /><br />I didn&#39;t care about ocean acidification until I saw this video - It explained &gt;how it works&lt; sufficiently for me to &gt;understand&lt; how it is a problem, rather than feeling I&#39;m just supposed to &gt;believe&lt; it&#39;s a problem because someone claims it&#39;ll totally kill everything.<br /><br />I think in future CO2/climate videos people make, the part about ocean acidification is the part to emphasize. Even if excess CO2 had no temperature/climate effect, or if you don&#39;t care about higher temperatures or New Orleans and other coastal areas being flooded or filled with deadly gas, an acidified ocean with our delicious fish and seaweed all dead is clearly a bad thing. It would certainly put us at a greater risk of famine if that food source disappeared! Also, for people who are skeptical, it&#39;s much easier for an individual to go out to the ocean and get a water sample for analysis to determine how acidic the ocean is, than it is for an individual to put a satellite into orbit to collect temperature data.

If the water is in the polar ice caps, and the ice caps are floating in water, how does them melting affect the sea levels? Would the amount that the ice caps already displace due to their weight just cancel out when they melt?<br /><br />Does it have something to do with the salinity of the water?

One of the most obvious explanations is that the leaders undertake many actions that make it possible for them to pretend they are doing something effective to avoid catastrophe: endless conferences, resolutions, disarmament talks, all give the impression that the problems are recognized and something is being done to resolve them. Yet nothing of real importance happens: but both the leaders and the led anesthetize their consciences and their wish for survival by giving the appearance of knowing the road and marching in the right direction.&quot;	UCCylh79D-2jZ93Ih8l8HmWQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCylh79D-2jZ93Ih8l8HmWQ	0

Is it possible you could do another climate change video? You could compare: this video to the new video, what has happened since 2012, were our predictions worse than we thought, with new technology what can we expect or really anything(you know how to do these videos, not me). I just think that this is a super important subject that everyone must know about, and your show is exceptionally good at getting vital points across.

This is a term from social psychology that denotes a individual is less likely to take responsibility or action if they assume others are just as responsible or more so. There is also the assumption that something is already being done. The problem of climate change caused by human activity is a global problem in a world that cannot help but think in regional or nation state terms.

When they were either all banned or heavily regulated, the temperature barely increased, even with the increase of coal usage in china, the USA, and india.

Climate alarmists always make claims like that, but on what evidence? Most of their predictions of the last decades have been shown to be wrong. Animals generally don't adapt very fast because the climate generally doesn't change very fast. If it does they will adapt, old species will no longer be effective and new ones will emerge.

CO2, H2O, methane (CH4) among many others will absorb heat by "vibrating" and then releases some of that heat back to the surface. its analogous to putting a piece of metal and a piece of paper under a hot lamp. once you take both objects away from the lamp, the metal feels much hotter to the touch because it absorbs heat more easily than the piece of paper. and if you hold your hand right above both objects, youll easily feel that the metal is giving off more heat than the paper. but to truly understand "why" some materials absorb heat more easily than other materials requires much more understanding of physics/chemistry/material science etc. plants use CO2 and expel oxygen. animals use oxygen and expel CO2. the earth is generally in a stable equilibrium because the number of plants and animals does not change drastically in short periods of "geologic" time (a short period is like a century or two). but ever since the industrial revolution, we've been pumping a large amount of CO2 and other gasses into the atmosphere in a century and a half. the only precedents we have in our climactic record of such large changes in atmospheric content in short periods of time are massive events like the eruption of a supervolcano or asteroid impact etc. and these generally lead to giant climactic shifts and wide spread mass extinction because most life will find it hard to adapt if the climate changes so quickly (again quickly in the sense of geologic time). the normal climactic trends we have researched had developed over hundreds of thousands of years, giving life a lot of time to adapt, survive and ultimately evolve into different organisms more adapted to the new climate. humans would definitely be able to adapt with a gradually shifting climate over thousands of years. but a couple degree rise in ave temperature in a hundred or so years will melt ice sheets quickly and we might not be able to relocate the billions of people live on land that would definitely be underwater on an ice-free earth (and again our earth has been ice free in the past, but such a quick transition will undoubtedly have tragic consequences for every species on earth, especially humans) youre right in that the science behind climate change is rarely explained properly and concisely but i think that problem exists because most people probably couldnt properly explain many complicated scientific phenomena and those who can will inevitable stuggle to offer a concise explanation. this shits complicated lol. which is generally why we accept the results of scientists who've spent much much more time and energy on these topics. after all, its not as if many of us really understand how the internet works on a scientific level, but society (and capitalism/free market) generally accepts that the scientists behind these technologies know what they are doing. and if any of us still has serious doubt, its our responsibility to immerse ourselves in the science in order to prove these scientists wrong, but until we do that, we probably shouldnt be arbitrarily ignoring the findings of a massive consensus of scientists	UCP_Z4jca3xRmIv1BQn_vkTQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP_Z4jca3xRmIv1BQn_vkTQ	1	UghVOKsugqd3d3gCoAEC	Wouter Vos

The reason nobody really wants to do anything much about it (aside from maybe riding a bike and recycling some garbage) is that deep down no one actually believes it. Least of all that multitude of &quot;real scientists&quot; out there whose &quot;consensus&quot; protects them from being assaulted in the street by true believers. Oh and the true believers deep down don&#39;t believe it either. Or they&#39;d be parading through the street beating themselves with thorn bushes. NOBODY actually deep down believes this nonsense but everyone is afraid of becoming a pariah if they admit it. In any case, as should have been obvious from the start, if it&#39;s all actually true (obviously it isn&#39;t) there&#39;s nothing to be done about it that could make much of a difference. So go on, join the multitudes sounding off on this issue, in the media, the blogosphere, Twitter, Facebook, Youtube, etc. Whatever makes you feel good about yourself.

Which causes ice to melt faster in the poles, which changes the way the oceans and jet streams work, which messes with weather. Its all a chain reaction to our pollution of the atmosphere and oceans.  Some people say 1.5 degrees isn't a big deal. Well lets say I set my freezer to 31 degrees and put a bag of ice in it. That bag of ice will never melt. Now if I turned it up to 32.5 degrees that ice will start to melt. But it would take a long time. Now If I set it to 34 degrees then it will melt extremely fast. This is the fear that could happen in the next 50 years. If the sea levels raise just 6 feet hundreds of cities in the world would be affected and millions of people would have to leave those cities. This might not be a big deal for the US and similar nations, but for 3rd world nations you can expect hundreds of thousands of people dyeing. 	UCOhRGkbC0pPKeJh2mNgsZZw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOhRGkbC0pPKeJh2mNgsZZw	1	UgiGTJnnNatjOXgCoAEC	Toaster Strudel

It would help people and give them something actionable (I was a part of a Washington initiative that got on the ballot: 1631) and informs them on what policies and politicians to vote for to help stem the tide.

So no we don't need to stop eating meat or dairy instead we need to be smart about we manage our livestock.

You excite a molecule, it resonates and bumps the the molecules into resonance. When the daylight is gone the molecules are still resonating and make the offending molecules carry on resonating at their mechanical frequencies. So absorption becomes radiation. Study this very carefully. Note where CO2 radiates. http://www.arm.gov/science/highlights/images/R00237_1.png Band edges and above the ionosphere.

I said it will lower the rate of heat loss compared to a scenario where there is no second, albeit colder, object. And nobody says that the earth's atmosphere "creates" extra heat. What we are trying to help you understand is how it retains extra heat. The energy from that comes from the sun, not the earth. The ability to retain extra comes from GHGs. Even a little bit more retention, say 0.1% more, will start to retain more.	UC1BgCg8DAXlkqVDRcBbYQ1A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1BgCg8DAXlkqVDRcBbYQ1A	1	UghABWlkutgiE3gCoAEC	Sergio Mujica

Anything that is at a temperature above absolute zero will radiate some or that thermal energy. What you are thinking of is the net exchange of that energy, in which case the net effect is that the warmer body will lose energy, while the colder one will gain energy. However, a warm body will have a reduced rate of net energy loss if it is near a colder (but not absolute zero) body, as opposed to it being surrounded only by absolute zero space (not that that's possible in reality). The same will be the case if a body at 20degrees C is near one at 10degrees C, as opposed to near one at zero degrees C: the net heat loss of the 20deg bod will be slower in the former situation, relative to the latter.

The warming trend has seen pauses since the start, typically on 30 year cycles, roughly correlated with oceanic cycles. But these are just on top of the overall upward trend, and where the 'pauses' previously saw temperature go down (early 20th century), then flat (mid 20th), now still increasing, so even these 'cooling' effects are no longer enough to actually, you know,  "cool". http://www.woodfortrees.org/plot/hadcrut3vgl/from:1850/mean:96/to:2014/plot/hadcrut3vgl/from:1850/to:1880/trend/plot/hadcrut3vgl/from:1880/to:1910/trend/plot/hadcrut3vgl/from:1910/to:1940/trend/plot/hadcrut3vgl/from:1940/to:1970/trend/plot/hadcrut3vgl/from:1970/to:2000/trend/plot/hadcrut3vgl/from:2000/to:2014.6/trend As for following the sun, if you took off your bad glasses you would see that the temperature trend has not followed to solar one since the 80s at  least.

Here, I'll look it up for you: Integrity: "Integrity is the practice of being honest and showing a consistent and uncompromising adherence to strong moral and ethical principles and values.[1][2][3] In ethics, integrity is regarded as the honesty and truthfulness or accuracy of one's actions. Integrity can stand in opposition to hypocrisy,[4] in that judging with the standards of integrity involves regarding internal consistency as a virtue, and suggests that parties holding within themselves apparently conflicting values should account for the discrepancy or alter their beliefs.... integrity is the inner sense of "wholeness" deriving from qualities such as honesty and consistency of character. As such, one may judge that others "have integrity" to the extent that they act according to the values, beliefs and principles they claim to hold." -Wikipedia You said "Im a member of the "scientific community" I pretty much say what they want regardless if its based on fact or truth. They write my check so I will say anything to pay the rent". To what degree does that define your integrity? Or the lack thereof? Another word that comes to mind is "fraud".

The theory of global warming as well as cell theory, and the heliocentric theory have all been proven time and time again through many observations.

If you want to claim that a minor change in the composition of the atmosphere can have a large effect on temperature, that&#39;s grounds for an honest discussion. When you start right in with disparaging names like &quot;denier&quot;, express temperature in F so that the change seems larger, and then characterize a relatively small change in a trace gas as &quot;drastic&quot;, it&#39;s pretty clear that you&#39;re agenda driven.

We really know it&#39;s bad for us (the classical addictive behaviour, and our climate damaging behavior), but we find all kinds of (lame) excuses not to change this damaging behaviour. This is because we fear the potential of losing something that we have right now than the almost certain loss of something &#39;far&#39; in the future, even if the future loss is by orders of magnitude worse than the immanent loss (Drug addict: Their next &#39;high&#39; vs. their health; climate damging behaviour: a whole lot of comfort vs. a perfectly habitable planet, which is the only one we know of so far). Our Psyche still is very much focused on solving problems that are right in front of us, and if giving up our comfortable, yet long term damaging behaviour, only yields the problem of finding something else to replace this behaviour, of which we don&#39;t know how well this endeavor will work out, we tend to stick with what we know will work for us and try to deal with the fallout. Writing this, I recognize that this also applies in many aspects to toxic relationships, though toxic relationships often include a reduction of confidence in the (co-)dependent party which will make them actively believe that they aren&#39;t worthy of anyone better than they have to cling to at the given moment	UCqlvjwYxStega80p4CehQ5Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqlvjwYxStega80p4CehQ5Q	0

One coal plant puts more shit in the air than a million people, one politician may want to sanction it for breaking emission laws, another politician may try to convince us that it's harmless because he has been lobbied by the plant's owners to say that. I say live your life as you feel fit, but vote for the correct person who you think could make the world better.

But today: 1. Earths orbit has not changed. 2. Oceans have more CO2, not less -&gt; the source of CO2 is NOT the oceans. 3. Temp and CO2 rise in tandem today, unlike the 800 year lag that we see in the past. 4. Radiometric dating of the extra carbon in the atmosphere shows it came from fossil fuel.

Climate has happened many times in Earth&#39;s history. It has been occurring long before we evolved, and it will occur long after we are gone. The recent changes are not significant when looked at historical climate change. The earth is always changing, and it is not because we are causing it to change. 100 years ago we were in the little ice age, so personally I&#39;m glad it is warmer now.

Not to mention you have to sell your current vehicle just to get one. Maybe if governments offered tax breaks for anyone that drove eco friendly vehicles we would see more people using them.

Ugg-ouGzpBqi0HgCoAEC	0	0	2017-04-21 17:20:27	El Gringo	The CO2 molecule is a linear molecule and thus only has limited natural vibrational frequencies, which in turn give this molecule only limited capability of absorbing radiation that is radiated from the Earth’s surface. The three main wavelengths that can be absorbed by CO2 are 4.26 micrometers, 7.2 micrometers, and 15.0 micrometers. Of those 3, only the 15-micrometer is significant because it falls right in range of the infrared frequencies emitted by Earth. However, the H2O molecule which is much more prevalent in the Earth’s atmosphere, and which is a bend molecule, thus having many more vibrational modes, absorbs many more frequencies emitted by the Earth, including to some extent the radiation absorbed by CO2. It turns out that between water vapor and CO2, nearly all of the radiation that can be absorbed by CO2 is already being absorbed. Thus increasing the CO2 levels should have very minimal impact on the atmosphere’s ability to retain heat radiated from the Earth. That explains why there appears to be a very weak correlation at best between CO2 levels and global temperatures and why after the CO2 levels have increased by 40% since the beginning of the industrial revolution the global average temperature has increased only 0.8 degrees centigrade, even if we want to contribute all of that increase to atmospheric CO2 increases and none of it to natural causes.

We evolved to exploit resources similarily to previous species exploiting resources to their own demise. Their have been a few previous species that exploited things. Check out the great oxygenation event, a mass extinction caused by one species of cyanobacteria producing too much oxygen which cooled the planet and killed off many species. It took us a few million years to evolve into a species that exploits our resources but nature has a way of cutting back on things when this happens and when we finish off this mass extinction the planet will go on with a new set of species that are adapted to the new conditions.

The energy of hurricanes and all storms comes from jet streams and is delivered through vortices in the form of low pressure. (Wind shear at low altitudes is the most important predictor of severe weather.) Warm moist air/water is not the source of the energy of storms, it&#39;s the target of the low pressure energy of vortices:<br />The &#39;Missing Link&#39; of Meteorology&#39;s Theory of Storms<br />@t	UCcg8R1ALfDP7sGkeIEBjkMQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcg8R1ALfDP7sGkeIEBjkMQ	0

Do it right and you increase soil fertility, vastly reduce soil errosion, sink carbon (for those worried about carbon) and get tasty steaks. We should stop doing it wrong.<br />Temperature drives CO2 (with a lead time of around 800 years) not the other way around.<br />Solar activity appears to drive temperature. About that you can do absolutely nothing.<br />Plants like CO2. Animals like plants. I like animals and plants (yum). Ergo, I like CO2.<br />Climate change is real (always has been) but man made climate change from CO2, er not so much.<br />It&#39;s just an opinion but if you feel the need to call me names, go ahead, get it out of your system.

So one of the most efficient and msot highly valued environmental actions you can take is to forgo parenthood. I am not suggesting this, I am just shining light on a perspective that hopefully can make people think about what things "really matter" and whether we should "go down that path" and also examine what we believe is our "right". I.e can you claim that having children is a right while at the same time shaming meat eaters for the carbon emissions they contribute too? Why so fervently point the finger at meat eaters when the actions of meat eaters pale in comparison to the actions of baby makers. Why not attack the things that really matter? Oh, because giving birth to children is a human right even though it´s one of the worst thing you can do environmentally (in regards to CO2 emissions, but probably many other environmental issues too!)? Do you find it hard to attack those types of people? Is it because you are likely one of them (because most are)? Is it because you think it is easier to give up on eating meat (or cut down) than to give up a dream to start a family? Maybe it is... I understand if you don't want to adress issues that are bound to fail. Just remember that baby making means at least one more life (but probably many more) of human carbon foot print while meat eating only causes high carbon foot print in "this life". Also understand that many meat eaters, a big majority, won't change their habits because of environmental issues. Even if they understand the problem. Old habits die hard. Maybe there are other "out of the box solutions"? I do like to point out ineffective strategies and I strongly believe telling people that regular meat consumption causes high carbon emissions is mostly ineffective. But I try not to be the cynical "we can't do anything about it, let´s continue destroying our planet having fun on the way because people don't change!". So I would like to add some optimism with some ideas. Right now, a lot of the world sees nuclear power as environmentally dangerous. This despite the dangers, the deaths, the trail of mutations and cancers linked to nuclear accidents (Chernobyl and Fukushima mostly) and nuclear warfare (Hiroshima and Nagasaki mostly) are much lower than what media and "environmental organizations" (like greenpeace) try to paint. Per kWh it is the purest form of energy. Cleaner than solar, wind and energy from renewable sources. Wind is also very problematic as an energy source since you need a buffert of energy stored somewhere to balance out when the wind doesn't blow. A society needs more or less a constant supply of energy. If you get 20% too little for 2 hours it doesn't help much that you get 40% more for 4 hours. Energy from dams can act as a buffert but they are rarely enouugh and wind is also using up a lot of rare earth materials and this for very little energy. The building of a wind turbine generator is in itself environmentally dubious thing and it´s hard to say it "pays off" during it´s life time. Solar panels also use a lot of rare materials and to generate a considerable amount of energy from solar requires a huge amount of rare materials that we may not have available. It does seem to have more potential than wind at least though. This labeling of these sources as "green" is highly misleading and since these sources generate very little energy, when you try to avoid nuclear, the consequence of this means that you are forced to increase coal power production. The absolutely worst energy source of them all (but efficient, as long as you throw tons and tons of coal on the "fire"). It also has an extremely high death rate per kWh produced (nuclear again having the lowest of all energy sources, and yes I am saying that less people get killed by nuclear power than wind and solar power if you look at the kWh produced) Knowing this, and understanding how much better (safer AND more efficient) nuclear power has become and how much potential it has. If one is to be considered someone who thinks about the environment, we should think about developing and deploying more modern reactors to cut down on or remove coal power all together. For instance. A lot of the uranium we have used in our reactors up until today have harnessed about 1% of the power held in the nuclear bonds within. This because the technology we have used hasn't been able to extract more. To generate power from radioactive material is, you could say "speeding up the radioactive decay" so when you dig up and use naturally occuring radioactive material you reduce the radioactivity. The waste product is less radioactive than when you found it, and then you may dig underground again. (Bare also in mind that nuclear waste takes up tiny amounts of space. The whole worlds nuclear waste can fit on a football field). But since the "waste" still holds about 99% of nuclear energy you can use modern readtors which can extract basically all of the 99% that are left. This means that the energy used so far from these sources can be reused a "99 times" again. And using the energy in that "waste", turning it into real waste, the radioactivity gets very weak. So it is much safer than storing it underground. We also have thorium as a nuclear alternative which is much more abundant on Earth compared to Uranium. And as a bonus, you can't make military grade plutonium out of it (one reason that uranium was chosen as "the" nuclear choice of energy). Thorium is also even safer because if something really bad happens, the reaction stops and the danger is contained. It can't spiral out of control. A dam breaking is a much bigger threat. If we used thorium alone as the only source of energy for mankind it is estimated that we have solved our energy problems for the next 5000 years. A nuclear loving policy could end coal power production and that would have a huge effect on lowering carbon emissions. Much bigger than "deconverting a few meat eaters here and there". Ok that was one idea. Another one is to continue researching artificial meat. Meat that is "grown" in a lab by bacteria through a much more environmentally friendly process that could hold potential if the technology gets developed for mass production. If you can find a much more efficient way of producing meat, that also tastes like meat, then those prices would be much lower and people just looove lower prices. A third idea is to take insects as a protein source seriously. This is, I believe an untapped market and what´s stopping it is in part some stupid regulations about "what food is" plus cultural ideas and psychological barriers to try new things. But if entrepreneurs could get an easier time opening up a market without stupid regulations standing in the way, then some "rare" people would be the first to try and over time it will become more popular and probably become "trendy" before reaching mainstream. Since insect production is super-fast and efficient and doesn't threaten the environment or use up tons of resources per pound of protein produced, having a cheap (and tasty I assure you, when people get over their psychological barriers and try) alternative to meat WILL reduce meat consumption by a significant amount. As time goes by meat will be seen as luxury and insect food will be more common alongside with artifical meat perhaps. Hope those points were interesting to some people!

There is a reason why our brains are bigger than our body size when compared to other mammals, and it's because we started to eat more energy packed foods, such as meats.

The question is, can government be trusted to regulate capital and we both agree the answer is no, because it has ignored it's own regulations that are instituted upon it by the Constitution.  I believe the size of a corporation should be regulated by the open market. The small players should get proportionately the same advantages as the large to keep competition healthy and fair.  At this point government is not the answer but the problem, it is crony capitalism , not capitalism that is feeding the monster. 	UCLgeSnoGJqI6_Mc84HPF-eg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLgeSnoGJqI6_Mc84HPF-eg	1	UggI4fa401TWAXgCoAEC	1965ace

Capitalism in it's purest form is the freedom to benefit from your own labor. It is the motivation that has no equal. Try getting your neighbor to work hard to buy you a car or force your neighbor to buy you a car (slavery , extreme socialism) and see how unhappy he becomes . Remember this, capitalism comes up with solutions while socialism limits the achievers. Both are necessary in a civilized society but the extremes destroy it. 	UCLgeSnoGJqI6_Mc84HPF-eg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLgeSnoGJqI6_Mc84HPF-eg	1	UggI4fa401TWAXgCoAEC	1965ace

It would take 83,333 hours of continuous maximum output to produce 1MWH. Let's say 5 hours a day max output for 17 years (lifespan of solar unit) that is a lifetime output of 372.3 KWH for $95 . I just received my electric bill . I used 676 KWH for $116.19. Solar is almost twice as expensive and I didn't have to devote any space, maintenance, or investment.  Furthermore we don't get our electricity from gasoline primarily it comes from Coal.  So I don't care about hypothetical models I can clearly demonstrate solar is inefficient expensive and unreliable. 	UCLgeSnoGJqI6_Mc84HPF-eg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLgeSnoGJqI6_Mc84HPF-eg	1	UggI4fa401TWAXgCoAEC	1965ace

You need 100 of these to power a hair dryer , that's $10,000 to run a small appliance only under ideal conditions for a couple hours a day. The average main in a house is 150 amps that correlates to 18 KW. It takes 1500 ft 2 to provide that much power for only 10% of the day, so just imagine we only need 10% of that peak power throughout the day. That means you would pay $142,500.00 for the equivalent of solar panels. The life span of a solar system is about 17 years.

Those that use Solar energy do so at the expense of millions of acres of plowable land that are destroyed each year with the heavy metals that are required in the production of those solar cells you love so much.  What is worse is that the Electric providers are required by law to pay you 5 times what your power is worth.  So you are actually stealing money that you really are not earning.  But then again, you probably haven't decided to turn off the neighborhood street light that probably shines on your panels, either.  And that is just theft from your community.

There is a very good reason for the ozone hole and that is production, O3 is made by the same UV radiation that it protects us from . If you look at the angle of the sun to the poles you will see that radiation has to travel through more atmosphere and at the critical angel of incidence will completely be reflected.  The ozone hole had nothing to do with CFC's, it is a natural phenomenon and given the nature of O3 production any O3 loss triggers more production. I have to disagree that banning all CFC's was a good thing. I have asthma and in 2008 they banned my inhaler medicine, the replacement was inferior and five times as expensive.

Of course no one is suggesting that we release more CPC's into the atmosphere, we have other propellants that seem to work as well, and in some cases better.  That doesn't change the fact that O3 released on the surface of the planet does not propagate to the Ozone Layer, and is considered a pollutant when on the surface of the planet.  It also doesn't stop scientists from wondering if we didn't overreact when we let Politics enter the realm of Science.   The Simple Fact is that Human induced Global Warming is a myth that was started by a few scientists to squeeze money out of the German Government to fund Climate Studies.  The Scientists that originally created the term, "Global Warming" had actually found that the climate was in a constant state of fluctuation and had subsequently shut down the study.  That was in 1984.  In 1988, a future presidential candidate who was still in the US Senate decided to Champion "Global Warming", 4 years after the German study closed with the statement that it was Most Likely NOT caused by Humans.  This Senator decided to drop the word "NOT" from the German Study's conclusion and started his campaign of fear mongering around the US, and then the World.  "Human Induced Global Warming" is a Myth, the Science doesn't stand up to the reality, the weather models do not show the current conditions could not predict the past, and thus cannot be trusted to predict the future.  As this last year shows.  This is the latest into the year that I have had to deliver fertilizer, because the growing year is so short, or the winter held on too long.

"I personally know several scientists who wonder if the CFC's that are released at the surface of the planet are actually responsible for the breakdown in the upper atmosphere," You seem to confuse things, because ozone is in the troposphere, which is the 2. lowest layer of the atmosphere, so of which breakdown in the "upper atmosphere" are you talking about? It seems to me you are clearly confusing things and don´t really know what you talk about. "The reason they state for that curiosity is simple, because ozone created at the surface doesn't find its way into the upper atmosphere." Why would that be a curiosity for a scientist? Ground level ozone/aka smog is ozone that is created on the surface due to industry, cars etc, and of course has nothing to do with the ozone in the troposphere...and also has nothing to do with CFC´s and their effect on the ozone of the troposphere, since that ozone layer is essential as a protective shield while the ground level ozone is smog, having negative health effects when inhaled, so I´m not sure what your point is.

The reason they state for that curiosity is simple, because ozone created at the surface doesn't find its way into the upper atmosphere.

You believe their propaganda over the 97% of climatologists who say climate change is happening (Source: NASA) and the 13,926 out of 13,950 peer-reviewed articles on the subject that say it's happening. What I want to know is, why? What does the scientific community gain from lying about climate change, and what are the chances that whatever they gain is bigger than what the fossil fuel companies are gaining?

Just ask the dinosaurs about climate change, they were wiped out at least once by it. It's nature it happens.  We have a large number of politicians and scientists living off this lie that we are going to cause "climate change" and it's going to destroy the planet. Some are very rich because of it, others have to go along to get funding for legitimate research projects.

UgixrWsB9aqQa3gCoAEC.83z3gzdwz7v7-bLBwIS8_v		1	2015-09-20 06:12:26	Comrade Dobler	Humans emit about 100 times more than volcanoes.   http://www.skepticalscience.com/volcanoes-and-global-warming-intermediate.htm Volcanoes emit around 0.3 billion tonnes of CO2 per year. This is about 1% of human CO2 emissions which is around 29 billion tonnes per year. Volcanoes emit CO2 both on land and underwater. Underwater volcanoes emit between 66 to 97 million tonnes of CO2 per year. However, this is balanced by the carbon sink provided by newly formed ocean floor lava. Consequently, underwater volcanoes have little effect on atmospheric CO2 levels. The greater contribution comes from subaerial volcanoes (subaerial means "under the air", referring to land volcanoes). Subaerial volcanoes are estimated to emit 242 million tonnes of CO2 per year (Mörner and Etiope (2002)). In contrast, humans are currently emitting around 29 billion tonnes of CO2 per year (EIA). Human CO2 emissions are over 100 times greater than volcanic CO2 emissions. This is apparent when comparing atmospheric CO2 levels to volcanic activity since 1960. Even strong volcanic eruptions such as Pinatubo, El Chicon and Agung had little discernable impact on CO2 levels. In fact, the rate of change of CO2 levels actually drops slightly after a volcanic eruption, possibly due to the cooling effect of aerosols.

See Steve Pinker&#39;s article: The Real Risk Factors For War Most wars are not fought over resources shortages, and most shortages of resources don’t lead to war. The Dust Bowl of the 1930s did not lead to an American Civil war; nor did the tsunamis of 2003 and 2011 lead to war in Indonesia or Japan.

Due to the level of technology we have making life physically easier, but needing better cognitive skills to live in such a world. If climate change pushes us evolutionary that would be quite something. We won&#39;t see it being dead and all, but it&#39;s an interesting thought experiment.

A USE would continue a trend. although being Dutch myself, I haven&#39;t heard much in this direction lately, I thought they tended more towards throwing Greece, Italy and Spain out entirely, being more in the other direction. I also miss the link you suggest between green initiatives and the loss of sovereignty. Do you mean that forcing people to buy only certain kinds of lightbulb gets them into the right mindset towards European unification?

The results are very hard to exaggerate. They just take scenarios of certain policies, and out comes the degrees of warming. I&#39;ll admit I haven&#39;t heard much of the bureaucrats&#39; alleged exaggeration. From what I gather, they understate it more often than they overstate it. Could you point me to an example?

I am not sure whether we are at the exploded stage or still lit the detonator stage. Which brings me to the proposed solution. Here in the UK we pay carbon tax in many forms, i.e plane, car tax etc. My main suspicion is that if you were right why is the state spending the money raised on everything but the environment? These kinds of things make me say something isn&#39;t quite right. 2. I cant see how its not a monopsony.	UCggShTpLw4oagbRBvVb-4FQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCggShTpLw4oagbRBvVb-4FQ	0

But your link about the spectral analysis was quite convincing. And just to explain myself I do (and did) believe the most recent episode of global warming is man made. I just didn&#39;t know to what degree it was caused by burning fossil fuels. Also I find it strange that evidence for it isn&#39;t commonly seen.

It doesn&#39;t matter a fetid dingos kidney whether you understand climate or not. The evidence that human caused GHG emmissions are largely responsible for current warming is compelling. Pretending that&#39;s not the scientific consensus is stupid. I&#39;ll give you my solution when you answer my 3 questions.

Last month, the CO2 level was 392.92 ppm. That level is increasing not linearly, but exponentially, like our population. Knowing that atmospheric CO2 contains long wave radiation, aka heat, it is immediately evident that our CO2 production does, in fact, warm the planet.

This is actually why I can live here, a degree north of the frickin&#39; Arctic Circle. If the Gulf Stream changed in any way, it would seriously affect the climate up here, most likely making it pretty inhospitable.

You can look the measurements of CO2 in earth&#39;s atmosphere over time, and how we know that humans caused the substantial increase we&#39;ve seen. You can see how physics shows that while water vapor acts as a greenhouse gas, CO2 absorbs a different area of the EM spectrum &quot;mopping up&quot; escaping radiation that water vapor doesn&#39;t get. There are answers in the scientific literature.	UC5L5BIwdK22orct8Yw-kFbQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5L5BIwdK22orct8Yw-kFbQ	0

I would just like to take a moment to put in my two cents. 1) There have been mass climate changes in the past which we have proven due to the Ice Core data. 2) The last major climate change was roughly 100,000 years ago. While we can argue whether it was man-made or not (I believe it is man made due to CO2 levels never being this high at 391.03 ppm), civilization as we know it will change, since we constructed cities based on the past 100,000 years of climate.

For instance, the best models of thermohaline circulation that we have suggest that it will slow down rather than stop, although recent evidence is hard to interpret.

The question is just of scale. I don&#39;t believe it is entirely or mostly down to man. If it is down to man fine, but there is evidence that there has been an ice age in the past. To me it shows that the event of climate change seems to be a natural cycle of sorts. Which if true makes me think maybe our impact is minimal when looking at it in its entirety. 2.

Also, sun activity has nothing to do with the climate change we&#39;re experiencing. Studies show that the stratosphere is actually cooling slightly while the troposphere is heating up. If climate change were due to the sun&#39;s activity all layers of the atmosphere would be heating up. You should really consider doing some research on the topic.

The main issue is that CO2 levels have never been as high as they are today, given out 800,000 years of data. Second, I never said I support fruitless tax rises. But I am in favor of lowering our reliance on fossil fuels and supporting the green energy business. These will lower our CO2 emissions and perhaps lessen the effects of climate change.

Ultimately many people need to see it as a severe problem before any substantive change will be made... hopefully it&#39;s not too late by that point. :-P	UCFxZaaKtpASccc1y6hXmvZA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFxZaaKtpASccc1y6hXmvZA	0

He seems to think it&#39;s &#39;okay&#39; if it has happened before in the planet&#39;s history, which I think is because he&#39;s a big pessimist. We should aim to avoid disasters..

The light which is reflected back from the earth is different from the light coming in (there is more infrared in the reflected light). The atmosphere scatters the infrared more, so it gets trapped. Imagine the atmosphere as a sieve, the light coming in is sand. When the sand hits the earth it clumps together and now cant get back out the sieve, with longer wavelengths of light being bigger clumps of sand.

You don&#39;t need to run away mad. Just answer a simple question. How did every single institute get it wrong (not just wrong, but completely, absolutely, beyond belief wrong) and a handful of non-technical, non-scientist crackpots on the web get the right answer? Do you feel that question is unreasonable? Is that why you&#39;re stomping off mad?	UCzy31NYyZ8YEqPiF975OA8A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzy31NYyZ8YEqPiF975OA8A	0

And we all know when we overeat fatty meats like big juicy steaks. Either way, something that will happen in both cases (both cases being overeating proteins) is that you will get toxic levels of protein in your system. And you can, and will, over burden your kidneys and liver. tl;dr ignore everything paul maddock said and look at shadowlink. we need water right, that doesnt stop water intoxication doesit	UCvlt7Uq6Mx0E5iIo1E1Ufmg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvlt7Uq6Mx0E5iIo1E1Ufmg	0

How do scientist know we are causing climate change and that it is not part of the regularly scheduled magnificent working of the planet you mentioned? As a somewhat more depressing view, the Earth does seem to like regulating populations and even wiping out species. Maybe thinning out our population is the natural order...

It&#39;s a study of 50 people with OCD and 28% of them focused their illness of climate change. It says nothing about the people who work on climate change, except that a portion of the mentally ill focus on it. You&#39;re being lied to Tony. As far as depression and suicide, there&#39;s no reason. Overreacting to worst case scenarios is the sign of a disturbed mind.

In my view, we need to increase energy efficiency, research new technologies (like the recent methane hydrate mining, better solar panels to make them useful, etc) and loans/micro grants to the developing world to help them attain power with a smaller carbon footprint. If the Earth is heating naturally, we&#39;ll have to deal with it, but we don&#39;t need to be accelerating it.	UCzwuamFmWlwXZt-Lkphd52w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzwuamFmWlwXZt-Lkphd52w	0

If I find an English equivallent or an article, I&#39;ll let you know. I agree that the carbon tax isn&#39;t a solution, but the situation is, that even besides human influence, the earth is still getting warmer.

While historically CO2 looks to have trailed temp rise, this time it&#39;s leading it. This leads to the conclusion that it&#39;s not part of a natural cycle but is instead something artificial. As far as the models go, they show increasingly violent and unusual weather patterns including record snow falls, receding ice sheets, higher highs, lower lows, increased flooding and drought, etc. All stuff that&#39;s happening.

Notable ranges in desert (40F) vs ocean-side (10F). Sunlight is reflected &amp; absorbed, by the atmosphere &amp; surroundings -- daily high lags only a few hours &amp; seasonal highs lag by 3-5 weeks -- because of ground &amp; other material heat retention. The effects of air on incoming &amp; outgoing radiation are mostly immediate, like a magnifying glass or a blanket.

We must *all* begin to work on this issue and change our lifestyles. It&#39;s all to easy for us to &quot;stay the course,&quot; ignoring the arising problems -- humans hate change, but we must begin taking measures to live more sustainably. There are a lot of gloomy options for us to deal with, but hopefully we can reverse the progression we&#39;ve made -- we can only do that if we do start to change.

I, however, recognize that the Afghan conflict is much more of a necessary evil. The Jihadists are very much convinced that we need to be wiped out and we need to dismantle their organizations in order to put an end to the terrorism. We are slowly backing out, but not without watching our backs.	UCwkZscbZQVbl4Zb0dhNrjvA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwkZscbZQVbl4Zb0dhNrjvA	0

Over the last 650000 years of data collecting from NOAA, levels have never risen past 300 UNTIL NOW! In the 1950s it broke the 300 mark, at ~320ppm, and today it&#39;s pushing 400. Carbon levels have never been this high according to geological and ice core records until this point, and not until major industrialisation.

I do agree with you though that there is danger in geoengineering and the solution I stated should be used as a last ditch effort. A better plan would be to put solar screens into orbit to block out some of the sun, this would be insanely expensive (but so would be rebuilding New York 20 miles inland) and it would be reversible.

Also there are theories that we should have entered a small ice age based on solar cycles but we didn&#39;t due to greenhouse gases produce by agriculture. Now that that cycle is over we are getting hit with a double whammy though.	UC5NRDnjoDaZ-PnU0urBayHg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5NRDnjoDaZ-PnU0urBayHg	0

By far the vast majority of REAL scientists like Hank, Bill Nye, Neil DeGrasse Tyson, et. al. (with actual doctorates and peer-reviewed research) understand that climate change is actually happening now and that it is the result of human activity. There is just no comparison between the two.

Humans are responsible for a very low percentage of CO2 in the atmosphere, if not an insignificant amount. Also, CO2 and similar greenhouse gasses are only responsible for a miniscule amount of the greenhouse effect. Water vapor is the primary greenhouse gas, and we contribute little to nothing to the water vapor in the atmosphere. Actually look at the numbers before you make a video.

Still there is the problem of where to put it, gas reservoirs on land can be affected by earthquakes and damage from the pressure, while the plans I&#39;ve seen to pipe it into deep parts of the ocean seem only a little better.
