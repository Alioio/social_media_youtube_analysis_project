You know what Jesus calls us to do, Keith? He tells us to care over the earth and all who inhabit it. That includes Animals, Plants, Humans, etc. I do not understand how caring for the environment ever became political. It is so disheartening to see how half of these people say they are not open to changing their minds. We should be open on all vulnerable, controversial topics. If we aren&#39;t, no change will ever occur. This is sad, so very sad.	UCjQbN5LGyc28r1VzwUAu-ZQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjQbN5LGyc28r1VzwUAu-ZQ	0

The way we - as humans - treat our environment is anti-human. Because sooner or later we&#39;ll be responsible for the extinction of the human race. And not only that. If we continue to act as if the world is exclusively ours, we&#39;ll end up destroying everything - including innocent animals and plants..

It&#39;s a microcosm of the larger political divide we see today: &quot;you&#39;re not just wrong, you&#39;re actually a bad person because you think that way.&quot; That approach will never change hearts and minds.

Stealing Native American Resources for the frivolousness of anyone but Native Americans. DAPL was the first time MAINSTREAM MEDIA put the LENSE on Native Americans (MINIMAL AT THAT). What about FRACKING near YELLOWSTONE for God Sakes. These people are out of their realm, almost entirely White with Privilege of thinking it’s okay to Steal from Natives. Our ancestors looked out for the Generations ahead, with the Generations of NOW taking care of them. Not stealing from them or worsening life for them. These skeptics don’t know that Bison made the farm lands of the Midwest seem more fertile, consequently the Dust Bowl and Great Depression occurred 50 years Later. The shores of the East Coast were filled with abundance with Crab and Lobster, literally called the Red Shores. The water ways of the West have diminished for the need of Clean Drinking and Usable Water. Colorado River and the Mountains of the Sierras, continuously sucked by the SUCK of PRIVILEGE and SKEPTICISM.	UCOiqEustu8pQQ8nJ4MkzN6g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOiqEustu8pQQ8nJ4MkzN6g	0

However nothing says that is a prerequisite for development today. To say so is entirely ideological. If you look to europe as an example, in Sweden the power mix is roughly <br />40 % nuclear<br />40 % hydro<br />10 % wind<br />10 % CHP (bioenergy/MSW) and other sources.<br /><br />Whom are highly scalable. <br /><br />We live in the most safe and nourishing environment? If you are referring to the Holocene period, yes, it&#39;s well suited for human life and the reason we need to cut emissions is to SUSTAIN the livable environment so we do not tip over into an highly uncertain era called Anthropocene.

The more DIRECT sunlight the higher latitudes poles receive. Warming the southern hemisphere heat sink oceans and thawing the northern hemisphere frozen co2 continents. Which is why temperature rises first and co2 follows. Cause and effect.<br /><br />Every 13 k years when the Precession of the north star aligns the equator with the solar orbital plane at the ecliptic&#39;s. The gravitational pull of the SUN pulls tsunami&#39;s around the planet East to west because the planet spins west to east.<br /><br />It happened before it will happen again.<br />Not if but when.<br /><br />The one off with the slow rise of sea levels after the global tsunami&#39;s is the Zanclean flood of Noah in the Mediterranean.

And we have fires in Cali for three reasons 1) humans killed all the predators and prey that used to curate the organic growth 2) humans took down natural barriers to develop habitable land for human shelter and recreation, and 3) acceleration of climate change due to human tampering with atmospheric cohesion. <br /><br />At the end of the day, why limit ourselves and our thinking to what&#39;s worked in the past, why not be better....be excellent, for the best positive outcome of all?

In 1998 UN officials said that entire nations will be wiped out by the year 2000. = did not happen. <br /><br />2. In 1967 a book titled &quot;famine. America&#39;s decision: who will survive&quot; <br />Supported by &quot;scientists.&quot; Said that there would be global mass starvation by 1975. = did not happen. <br /><br />3. In 1982 Mostafa Tolba!, (the executive director of UN environment program) <br />Said that there would be global catastrophe by the year 2000 similar to a &quot;nuclear holocaust.&quot; <br />= did not happen. <br /><br />4. 1970, Sen. Gaylord Nelson, often considered the “father of Earth Day” believed that in 25 years, 75 and 80 percent of all the species of living animals will be extinct.”<br />= did not happen. <br /><br />5. In 2006, while promoting his movie “An Inconvenient Truth”, Al Gore (again supported by &quot;scientists&quot;) said that humanity had only 10 years left. <br />= did not happen. <br /><br />6. The U.N. officials also claimed: &quot;the most conservative scientific estimate is that the Earth’s temperature will rise 1 to 7 degrees in the next 30 years.”<br />But looking back from 2019, the temperature rose about half of a degree Celsius since 1989, according to NASA. <br /><br />7. &quot;Scientists&quot; Prof Peter Wadhams, of Cambridge University, and Prof Wieslaw Maslowski, of the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California; said that entire polar ice caps would melt by 2016. = did not happen. <br /><br />When you keep on &quot;crying wolf&quot; eventually, people will get sick and tired of it!

We are animals, we are subject to the same laws of nature as any living thing.

First of all, I just hate it when the first words out of everyone&#39;s mouth regarding the environment is &quot;clean water and air&quot;. Right away, I know they haven&#39;t a clue about the issues facing mankind. Most of the comments made by these people are so ignorant it is painful. The one guy who says he wants a planet for humans, not animals first. Does he not understand the concept that the natural environment is what supports mankind. Man does not live independent of nature, but rather is part of it. You destroy one segment of this complex web and it results in many unforeseen consequences. Really disheartening.

UgynyNUCOov6nRAgCpF4AaABAg	0	1	2020-05-06 21:27:05	Fuchsteufelswild	I should have known that this would make me furious. Claiming to be well-educated on a topic while making false statements is honestly the worst. First of all, there is enough data; a quick google search really will do it. Btw it would only take the size of Israel to power the whole world with solar energy as the only source, not to mention that wind energy parks are often built in the ocean. And yep, that fact took me 2 min to find out. Obviously, a radical migration from fossil to green energy wouldn&#39;t be sustainable either, and nobody requests that. Secondly, don&#39;t act as if climate activists want to return to stone age. Technology is the greatest human invention and has a huge potential to solve a lot of our problems. There has already been so much progress, but it is just not made use of enough. Honestly, there is SO much that can be done without having an impact on life quality. I also don&#39;t like when people expect the government and companies to act all by themselves. Of course, companies are responsible for a big fraction of the emissions, but companies will always think capitalistic and thus, do what their costumers want. Simply being selective with packaging, quality and ecological footprint, will have them rethink their product. Similarily, less meat is produced if the demand decreases.

We can make the changes so species can keep up with the normal rate of change, or we can increase the rate of change and have animals go extinct. We as people will take a hit and move inland, but we and every plant and animal that we deem necessary to human survival will be fine. So if they don&#39;t have compassion for polar bears, that&#39;s on them. I love the diversity the plant has to offer, even if it doesn&#39;t serve a purpose to me.

While the evidence shouldn’t be questioned, it may be discussed about what we do with it. And this is a question of values and interests. I think it‘s problematic if people distrust scientists only if they are not pleased by their suggestions for stopping global warming for example.<br />Personally, I don‘t believe the world we live in is „flourishing“ and at its best (as the fossil fuel expert in the video was saying). it may be true that in the western world we have a high life standard nowadays. but the gap between rich and poor is increasing, we are living our „great lives“ with the consequence of many people suffering. <br />while so many inspiring people out there are actually working on sustainable solutions, on ways to foster equality and to reduce our impact on the environment, too many people are trying to go further, to make economy thrive even more, holding on to wasteful and harmful lifestyles. but the world hasn‘t always been this way. elderly people grew up with a more decent understanding of our world. it may be true that the world’s energy demand can’t fully be covered by renewable energy. but the problem will be solved if we take a step back, finally acknowledging that „development“ isn’t everything.

If you actually look at the Bible, in Genesis, right after humans were created, God gave us dominion over the world. Then humans turned away from God and to sin, which is when death came into this world. Then, humans started sinning and building the world on top of death and destruction of CREATION, and now humans only are focused and driven by sin, and not God. We know that the end of this world will be because of a result of sin, and climate change is a result of fossil fuels which = money = greed = destruction of planet = sin <br />p.s. im literally studying environmental science and i love jesus and i know that biblically you can see climate change is real and christians need to open their eyes to the reality of this world with science ad god both being two real things that work hand in hand, not seperate; science is humans discovering how god works, and its telling us that humans are destroying this world and we need to change our actions if we want to continue humankind. and god gave us free will too so maybe its up to us and god walks with us in our descisions not just has a straight path that we go down, and worlds end date is X date but maybe its we have free will to bring death onto this world, just like we have free will to follow god and accept christ BRO CLIMATE CHANGE IS SO BIBLICAL WHATTTTTT<br />alsoooo you are talking about fossil fuels as if we dont have to drill into the layers of the depth of earth&#39;s stored oils, killing many ecosystems along the way, and then burning this oil for air pollution, all this for energy; when God handed us the sun and was like heres some free energy that never runs out WHAT	UCjBJvvUik7mefMt4qzdNqeg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjBJvvUik7mefMt4qzdNqeg	0

This is the problem with skeptics, they believe that humans are more important than the rest of biodiversity. We cannot continue to believe that we are different and better than the rest of the animals and plants because we are the species that expanded the most. This kind of way of thinking is very dangerous and we must prevent the world from it. And also thinking that mainstream media and politics are all about saving the environment is a joke, that is not true because if it was we wouldn&#39;t be where we are right now. Although, I agree that sometimes activists can be very aggressive and have the tendency to shame others but it is time to stop being kind because we don&#39;t have time.

Most young people are very concerned about man made climate change and are informed by nasa and seek out people who study the climate professionally. A lot of these people are borderline conspiracy theorists. I don&#39;t think that it&#39;s true that innovation in technology to overhaul our energy system in the states will bankrupt us. Renewable energy will be cheaper in the long run. The true cost of business as usual will continue to rise as we experience more extreme weather, more war from different countries competing for depleted resources and more refugees as their homes become less live-able.

You actively chose people who wouldn&#39;t even challenge some wannabe boomer when he repeatedly demeaned a teenage climate activist. Fuck you. You don&#39;t want empathy. You want to give people excuses to spew right-wing propaganda to people who actually want equality, and in doing so move the conversation back to the right in a period of time where we UNEQUIVOCALLY need to move left as a species to be able to endure as a species.

Once with have tech that can produce and sustain energy equal to or more than fossil fuels through any kind of conditions and situations that won&#39;t lead to a societal collapse I&#39;ll be all for it but until then? it&#39;s better to keep using fossil fuels. Of course, one idea we could do is go full Nuclear while using Solar, Hydro and Wind to supplement once we can mass produce the tech needed for that at a relatively low cost. An idea for the future I guess.	UC8hKT8AAs8ftMmGEDgVRqTQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8hKT8AAs8ftMmGEDgVRqTQ	0

The man that has his career based off of petropolitics and energy isn’t claiming that the climate isn’t affected he’s claiming that energy is more important then the climate conversation on a human need standpoint. He’s mainly arguing the concept “ The Law of Petropolitics” which is the theory that there is a trend between oil and fossil fuel freedom and the freedom of the human. When oil prices go up and destabilize the freedom for man goes down. Essentially he’s saying that the climate is changing, we may have a role in it or not, but it’s not more important then the survival of the fossil fuel industry. Which is why he said that opportunity to free energy would be good for human kind. Just to clarify the position that I truly believe he is making.

Basically, climate skeptics are economic practicalists , if such a word exists. They speak not so much against climate issues, but that economic development is the central lense by which to determine whether climate change is problematic or not. The human affects of climate seem to be not noticed by climate skeptics because they don&#39;t think economic development affects climate at all. Given that they do argue against climate change, it&#39;s because they think economic development and fossil fuels have little to no impact on the climate.

They depend on polar bears for food. Skeptics claim to care about people over the environment without realizing that we are part of the environment. Resources don&#39;t just magically appear, they arent man-made. Theres a process and a limit for everything. Fossil fuels have brought us so much value but these people only care that North Americans can continue to over-consume while people in the developing world who have never benefited from fossil fuels are becoming climate refugees.

Not even fracking can keep it running.<br /><br />Once its dry we will move back to coal which is also limited. Hence it will be inevitable that humanity will move towards greener energy (solar, wind, hydro etc.)<br /><br />And im confident humans are adaptable enough to live in a low electricity environment and still have a good quality of life. <br /><br />So it doesnt make sense to me when these fossil fuel clingers wanna keep the status quo. Move on. <br /><br />We should and I believe we are slowly moving towards a greener energy source which would have less impact on the environment. Peace out.

I felt encouraged by the ones who said they would be willing to change their minds if they had the right information presented to them though. I think it&#39;s important to explain how measures like the green new deal can actually improve people&#39;s quality of life, rather than being anti-human.

The air is clearing out, much less cars on the streets, much less air traffic. In general, the environment is reacting super fast to our lock down. This crisis for us, had some quick benefits for our environment too that we can now enjoy. Clean air to breath even in cities. It&#39;s great. Let&#39;s talk about that.<br /><br />But right away we see that the economy is collapsing. Millions are now out of their jobs. People are suffering and governments are in the debate between two bads. We are literally debating if we should risk the old and weak people for the sake of the many or not, cos our economies can&#39;t sustain this. We are on the brinks of collapse.<br /><br />So here is a look into a climate activist future. The measures we taken are still not as heavy as Greta or the Green New deal offers. Yet we are already worse off.	UCEclGnWA4PizSdvWZfEDcTg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEclGnWA4PizSdvWZfEDcTg	0

Ofc there is nuclear waste, but given technological advancement it doesnt need to buried on this planet in the future. Also how is polar ice caps melting not harmful for humans (they claim to be humanist)? Whether they believe climate change is human made or not how the fuck do they not understand how it is a problem? It will affect human life negatively no matter its source. And if it is a problem why is it bad trying to decrease its negative effects? Or they deny even the fact that greenhouse effect is real (if so they shouldnt voice an opinion on any topic as they are just morons)? Is money that important to them? Fuck human lives?

I think many people need to become awarer of how apparent the situation is tho. I live in Berlin, Germany and we have a Holiday house in the Black Forest, a medium high Mountain Range. The border where it would snow and not rain used to be on average between 450m/1475ft and 600m/1970ft. This border is now already only at 650m/2130ft to 800m/2625ft on average. There were no years without snow in over 50 years or probably even longer since the weather was only started to be recorded 50 years ago. Now it’s not officially safe for there to be snow anymore. But don’t get me wrong I agree with you and I know that it’s not as apparent everywhere on the world but while my problem not being able to ski in winter in one of 5 years is still an absolute first world problem people in California have lost their homes. I think in the end the humans are much too comfortable to change anything even if the planet around them is about to die (some time in the future) and the saving of the world will be down to a discovery of scientists (nuclear fusion energy, electro vehicles, lab-grown meat, etc.)	UCsFVA__4TcO20So4-2GQTLQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFVA__4TcO20So4-2GQTLQ	1	UgyY5UNyx0hX1MZQme14AaABAg	Madison Malik

If you live in places like California or similar, there will be more wildfires, in Florida there will be even more tornados, in the Great Plains it will be much warmer and dryer, cities or regions close to the coasts like New York City will have to fight problems like higher water levels and stronger erosion on beaches and stuff, in Africa the already limited Water will evaporate much quicker and the land will desertificate leading to less place to grow crops, in Australia and the Amazon there will be wildfires like the one last year (although the one in the Amazon is probably at least partially started by the Bolzonaro Government), in the Himalayas and other mountainous regions glaciers will melt just like it happened a few days ago in the Indian Himalayas and cause landslides, Europe will have to deal with even more refugees than it is already dealing with now, in Siberia and Canada the permafrost will melt and many Sandy island groups are predestined to vanish due to erosion and higher water levels. I covered most of the Planet now and i think this illustrates quite well that only part of the problem is due to selfishness but a large part is from too little trust in scientists (like shown in this video) and a ton of misinformation or not-at-all-information (like them not being informed at all idk a word for that).

We&#39;ve already seen all over the world that landmasses are shrinking because of raise in sea level, an increase in floodings and erosions with landslides. But nah, it&#39;s fine.<br /><br />Yes, for many people in the west world (at least in middle class and above), the &quot;social environment&quot; (which is an actual concept which is what Alex seem to think of instead of him trying to make the entire &quot;environment&quot; concept revolve around humans. Not only making him seem confused but also confusing many others). For others it&#39;s pretty damn shitty at the moment.<br />We have the privilege to concern ourselves with other things than basic needs. Sure that comes with other serious issues like problems with mental health and suicide rates in many places (though I don&#39;t know exact statistics from earlier on so I might be completely wrong, just that it gets more attention now) but we&#39;re still able to focus on things which we couldn&#39;t be bothered with before.<br />Though the actual environment, for humans, is getting worse. Wether you believe it&#39;s human made or simply natural, it is still getting worse. As Jeremy said, the world will be fine, it&#39;ll recover, by the looks of it not while humans still walk the earth though.<br />The fossile fuel has given us much, but even nuclear with waste that we don&#39;t know the impact of, seems like a healthier option than fossile at this point.<br />I see where Alex is coming from, if you believe in a scientific solution (ie, having the hopes that science will progress fast enough to solve this without any major damage) you do need a lot of power and it probably would be hard to produce all that in solar, wind or water power at least in quite some time forward (fossile might handle it but people are scared of that too). <br />But the scientific revolution is a gambler&#39;s solution. Scientific revolutions are never predictable and many people don&#39;t want to gamble with the survival of the human species.

Because 1. “Who cares we have other bears” is a very bad statement. Even the tiniest fly or musquito influences the enviorment, let alone for example an entire species of a predator like a bear. The entire ecosystem collapses and will get out of proportion and control. And 2. As a Dutch citizen, climate change and the melting of the ice caps is very scary for us all. I know that us Dutchies are known for being good with keeping our land and ourselves dry. But even our own government and professionals said that if the sea level rises a few meters more, about 3/4 of our country will be turned into an ocean. It may not affect you as much in EG: kansas, but it sure as hell affects other states and even countries. And 3. WE ARE NOT ALONE ON THIS EARTH. There are plants, animals and other species that deserve an enviorment that’s not just about human profit. Not to mention that we CAN provide enough wind/solar energy for the entire world by just using the land mass of spain. Spread this area out over the entire world and place it where it barely effects ecosystems (like tundras, countrysides and deserts).

The resources will become smaller and smaller. That's why regenerative energies need to be included more and more and they need to be improved over the years, just as the fossil fuels were. And even then nuclear energy brings way less air pollution and more energy, so we just aren't dependent on fossil fuels anymore...

With a climate denier in the White House I think it is very hard to argue this position is underexposed. In fact, it is dangerously overexposed, given the sheer lack of scientific support. Jubilee is contributing to a ‘false balance’, which is a situation where out of some journalistic commitment to letting everybody be heard, different positions are treated equally without any regard to the legitimacy of the argumentation. We do not teach Flat Earth in high schools, even though a decently sized group of people do believe in it. Giving exposure to climate change denial (or anthropogenic climate change denial) should be done proportionally to the factual relevance of the position, with consideration of the danger of spreading an apathy towards climate measures and sustainable reform. Jubilee, with a following the size of yours, please take social responsibility for the stuff you are putting out there.

I don&#39;t understand how a person cannot see that the vast majority of activism related to climate started because people&#39;s homes and environments were being destroyed and the earth that we live on is struggling because of things humans have done. if the earth dies, we go with it. so yeah, i like animals but i especially as a 15 year old dont want to watch the planet die in my lifetime. sorry that im &quot;naive&quot; or &quot;to young to understand&quot; even though I&#39;m reading what science is telling me. also, notice how none of them were environment scientists they were all older people who probably watch fox news, lets be real. i cant wait for people my age to start having a say in politics and being able to vote and hold office because we are some opinionated and strong-willed people and I know that we can create some real change and save this planet that these guys claim to love.

Generation Z is under the pressure to clean up Generation X &amp; Y&#39;s mess! Even if we were to stop ALL fossil fuel emissions right now, it still wouldn&#39;t be enough to reverse the damage it has done. The effects will last at least A CENTURY until things will &quot;get better&quot;. Yes there are certain natural disasters that contribute to climate change (volcanic eruptions and ocean currents), but those are things we CAN NOT CONTROL. What we can control is OUR footprint on the world as a whole, and I don&#39;t think many people realize that.	UCtO9osHgpmQrW_IbS5VqsHQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtO9osHgpmQrW_IbS5VqsHQ	0

If that happens, many other species will be at risk of extinction because a source of food will be lost for them. That will end up decreasing our food supply and put us at risk. It&#39;s all connected y&#39;all and what we do will lead back to us.	UCYsbhpGtpCq5oMSvM5mMDvw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYsbhpGtpCq5oMSvM5mMDvw	0

All animals that live near the north and south pole need to eat krill or eat an animal that eats krill. They are literally the sole source of all fauna in those areas. So if krill goes away, penguins will go extinct, fish will go extinct, whales will go extinct, polar bears will go extinct, sea birds will go extinct. And suddenly we will have no life in the sea. The entire fishing industry will go extinct.	UCXUgqPrQ1asnyeR4cYpLjeQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXUgqPrQ1asnyeR4cYpLjeQ	1	UgxJPepkKZ7Fr6po3mV4AaABAg	aibha

Scientists have been proving climate change for years, now it is not just numbers but noticeable. It’s not funny how the planets healthy greenhouse gas threshold is 350 parts per billion and now we are over 400. It’s not an opinion that in big powers farm food and raise cattle on large scales in poor countries with no restrictions, causing desertification. And it certainly is not skepticism to know that plastic in the industry is harming the earth because it doesn’t go away, it only becomes broken down and when it reaches a certain level it will be able to pass the barrier that protects much of our body and cause us and the planet more harm. This is not a belief, it’s reality.	UClXkxW1gyYydu0X22HRm0sQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UClXkxW1gyYydu0X22HRm0sQ	0

But when the emotions and follow-on thought structures associated with "worship" come into the picture, distortions begin to occur. For example, if she (Earth) is a deity, then you can reach a point where you are unwilling to allow change to occur because it offends your sense of holiness or purity. I'm not putting down those senses -- they are a necessary part of a good human life. But they limit your ability to participate in conversations without serious offense to your sensibilities. Multiply this by many thousands of people and you get deadlock, polarization, etc.	UCEJeINJRZrlxgeKxeJcTukA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEJeINJRZrlxgeKxeJcTukA	1	Ugw_0TXvyOz0Nd3dMjB4AaABAg	Madeline Chanel

All energy comes from the sun. Earth is a closed loop that self regulates co2 with LIFE. Earth is a 4.5 billion year old closed loop that self regulates co2 with LIFE. The climate cycles of our planet are continental glaciers with lower sea levels brought on by Global tsunami's. The changes in the tilt of the earths axis, north star and proximity to the SUN causes ClimateChange. Global warming The more the axis of the earth tilts towards the sun. The more DIRECT sunlight the higher latitudes poles receive. Warming the southern hemisphere heat sink oceans and thawing the northern hemisphere frozen co2 continents. Which is why temperature rises first and co2 follows. Cause and effect. Every 13 k years when the Precession of the north star aligns the equator with the solar orbital plane at the ecliptic's. The gravitational pull of the SUN pulls tsunami's around the planet East to west because the planet spins west to east. It happened before it will happen again. Not if but when. The one off with the slow rise of sea levels after the global tsunami's is the Zanclean flood of Noah in the Mediterranean.

And Though humans are minuscule compared to Earth and are easily influenced by it in physical and sometimes dangerous ways, we have some capabilities to do harm to it as well (which is a big part of the climate change ideal). So to some, including myself (Christian in my case, I'm not sure what his religion or philosophy is), it doesn't make sense to worship something that you can have any power over.

Then, when that didn't happen, they started calling it global warming. Then, when their predictions kept failing, they just changed it to climate change so they can still sound credible, even when their models keep on failing. Thus, using the new term, we all believe that the climate changes over time. However, the disagreement is if humans are directly responsible for it.

But if we don&#39;t minimise the negative aspects of change for our environment, the growth will collapse.<br />I think there is a general misconception from both sides. Minimising the climate change&#39;s consequences doesn&#39;t mean we have to sacrifice renewable energy, the exploration of the universe or growth in general. It just means resource management should be more important in our decisions. <br />Installing a PC cleaner software with 30GB size and 90% CPU usage is quite contrary, right? So why don&#39;t we think that way for all of our decision that affects all of our resources?	UC9oJYN0bjAvrC0JuqUjy4qQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9oJYN0bjAvrC0JuqUjy4qQ	0

"The CO2 sensitivity is unclear, as unclear as 30 years ago." Flat out untrue. Better instruments, better models, more scientist and more time, but hey, all of that I guess is just a giant conspiracy. Or how you explain your statement? "It is still supposed to be 1,5°C till 4,5°C with a doubling of CO2 since preindustrial times. " Reference? Without saying any time frame you just say empty Celsius values. "Talking of models, one of the lowest one is called NMCN4, it comes closest to the made observations, it neglects the greenhouseffect, so if we would accept this model we will be at 1,5°C max." NMCN4? What is that? I guess NMC stands for National Meteorological Center, but N4 could stand for anything. I really wonder what are your referring to here. Specially what kind of hack of model has a max value... though I guess you again missing the time frame, there is no max, just a time frame. "What barely anyone understands from here on, is that at this point CO2 is so weak it is even less possible to seperate from all other natural effects, which was the aim of this whole formula in the first place. In other words: The so called consensus has no expesiveness whatsoever." Of course consensus means nothing to you, as you clearly think you know it better then thousands of experts. I can only wonder on what you build such confidence, but I guess its not years of education by peers or years of reading journals, but instead reading conspiracy sites/sources on the internet.

It is still supposed to be 1,5°C till 4,5°C with a doubling of CO2 since preindustrial times. This is a logarithm, but call it whatever you want. Talking of models, one of the lowest one is called NMCN4, it comes closest to the made observations, it neglects the greenhouseffect, so if we would accept this model we will be at 1,5°C max. What barely anyone understands from here on, is that at this point CO2 is so weak it is even less possible to seperate from all other natural effects, which was the aim of this whole formula in the first place. In other words: The so called consensus has no expesiveness whatsoever.	UCvnxpmGdSc_Q3-kvoenwuRQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvnxpmGdSc_Q3-kvoenwuRQ	1	Ugx2lbq9Rz8CE_IU2EF4AaABAg	nyood mono

No its not logarithmic. And maybe people dont understand what is denied because in 99 % cases nothing specific is denied and the rest contradict each other quite often.... Also there is no simple answer to your question, a simple model says like 1c per 300ppm per like 50 years, but if we take 100 year its more like 1.5c if co2 stays constant and that is for example why its not linear in human time frames. Funny you said logarithmic pff....	UCEg7BdzrwUL6bo4YjffFB0g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEg7BdzrwUL6bo4YjffFB0g	1	Ugx2lbq9Rz8CE_IU2EF4AaABAg	nyood mono

Any issue is part of the "moral sphere" if it fulfils two conditions: 1) it has to be a conscious decision and 2) it has to affect wellbeing in a negative way. If these two are fulfilled, the issue has to be considered morally. We therefore have to consider harming a living being morally and justify it. However, in our case there is no justification, as the harm is done without any necessity. Therefore it's immoral. I hope this makes sense. English is not my first language and I've just only very recently learned about the base of our moral system, but I tried to explain it as well as possible.

Your second paragraph merely pushes the question back a notch. We know that it *is* wrong, but *why* is it? Where do we get this "ought" from?

What you just stated about my reply (and science in general) simply is not true on multiple levels. 1) I did not commit the fallacy. In fact, you were correct when you said I didn't actually describe a correlation between science and morality because I was focused on describing the way we utilize the knowledge of science when making moral decisions, which says absolutely nothing about the process by which we take that information and transform it into a decision .... so, given that I didn't formally correlate them yet, how can you say I committed a fallacy via making the correlation? Contradicted yourself there. 2) I do not believe in the notion of a god and I know through science that emotions, thoughts and all these other capabilities intelligent organisms have can be derived from the physical world (which is the only world that I know to exist). So when you say science can only describe the physical world -- what I hear is that science describes everything we know to be true. Supernatural conspiracy theories are nothing more than baseless guesses and have no place in a discussion of science because we cannot know with any level of certainty that they are true. 3) Now I will actually correlate science with decision making (aka what we perceive we "ought" to do) -- it's called a brain. It's entirely rooted in physical processes in which 90 billion neurons (yes, can you believe there are that many that fit into even your head?!) and other cells are taking in sensory information; causing neurochemical shifts; forming,breaking and reforming memories; providing sensations and even generating thoughts. There is obviously still a lot of research being conducted constantly and I have a few friends at the forefront of that research. However, to imply that morality (or what we "ought" to do) cannot come from anywhere other than religion is hysterically incompetent -- particularly because my morals suggest that many religious views (and I'd be happy to share particular examples if you'd like) are incredibly immoral and wrong in every way. So my morality certainly doesn't come from religion -- I can guarantee you that. Where else might in come from then? My brain.

And in fact you yourself just committed the is-ought fallacy. Science by definition is limited to the physical world, and cannot tell us anything about philosophical truths (morality being one of them). Science only tells you what *IS* happening not what *OUGHT* to happen or what we ought to do. And to answer your question, i get my morality from God.

That fallacy can be boiled down to suggesting that "the status quo is correct simply because it is the status quo"... which is the exact opposite of science and would frankly better (yet still not perfectly) describe a religious view of morality -- considering religious people believe everything that happens IS part of some perfect plan and therefore whatever the status quo is OUGHT to be "perfect" and "moral" in some sense because it's exactly what god intended (so it must be perfect and moral). Science, on the other hand, is constantly evolving and seeking truths through as objective a means as humanly possible... so to derive morality from scientific conclusions is to be open minded about changing your moral position as our understanding of the universe evolves. Science, as you stated, explains the world and everything in it (as objectively as possible). I would think people OUGHT to act based on what they know to be true and their understanding of the world -- derived from science. If not, then tell me: where do you derive morality from?

The survival of other animals directly affects the wellbeing of humans, not just because they're cute, but because a species collapse is likely to lead to human problems like food scarcity and collapse of ecosystems of which we are a part.

He only asked a question, and probably the both of you have similar opinions since you highlighted the importance of it from a humans survival and well being standpoint, which i understand and agree with, i just don’t believe it is our responsibility to protect every single species but to establish balance and maintain it, to have a good quality of life	UCIhUFW6ND0vqx1V9RStJbAQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIhUFW6ND0vqx1V9RStJbAQ	1	Ugzpz2cqHnPuv8Y8_ut4AaABAg	Gc Snizzle

You are the one assuming things here and it only hurts us as a society to have people be that aggressive and sure about something they have no clue about. Morality is a personal sentiment, it messes with our emotions, passions, and actions, it has nothing to do with empirical science and facts, it had to do with what we believe is right or wrong and i personally believe that acting like you are is totally wrong. We totally can argue morality if you want because it isn’t restricted to each one obviously (our rules of society are based on morality as well), that was what he was trying to debate and understand	UCIhUFW6ND0vqx1V9RStJbAQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIhUFW6ND0vqx1V9RStJbAQ	1	Ugzpz2cqHnPuv8Y8_ut4AaABAg	Gc Snizzle
Ugzpz2cqHnPuv8Y8_ut4AaABAg.96KD_LKeVnM96vbIVJzI7_		6	2020-04-01 22:16:50	Victor Rafih	nazmi nazmi he wasn’t being ignorant at all, the original comment was a view in which we as humans have a purpose or responsibility to maintain all species alive. That’s what he personally thinks is right, and rights or wrongs are a question of morality, so the reply was regarding why he viewed it that way. I personally think all animals including humans are selfish, they have to be in order to survive, even when we help people and act with solidarity we do it because it makes us feel good about ourselves... im not saying that it is bad because i think its awesome when we all benefit and feel good, but regarding evolution and animals “coming and going” i don’t think it is our mission to protect every single species, i do believe though that it is our mission to build a nice and balanced world for everyone including those animals, if a certain species hurt us they can go, if human overpopulation is bad for the quality of life of future and present generations we must limit it, if the system is already balanced we must assure that we don’t hurt it etc... but not just protecting every animal without a reason when it comes to our quality of life. I hope you get what i mean, like a don’t think many people would be sad if mosquitoes went extinct lol, because they annoy us, transmits diseases and as far as i know are not essential to life in general, unlike bees for example.

When the woman said that islands aren&#39;t disappearing, and aren&#39;t being submerged. I was baffled. I know people from islands, that their family will some for thousands of years. That does not exist anymore. Or, most of it is submerged. Which is why they left. I don&#39;t understand how that guy is pro human, and doesn&#39;t want to protect our survival.

The government would like to have power. We already agree that skepticism is the best approach to politics.

From a purely economic standpoint, we need to invest in energies that are not dependent on a finite resource. The economy will grind to halt when fossil fuels run out if that is the basis of economy. <br /><br />Another non environmental benefit to clean energy: we can stop kowtowing to oil rich nations we would otherwise condemn.

It would be interesting to see if all climate scientists agree on climate change bc contrary to popular belief, “97% of climate scientists agree on climate change” statistic is not accurate. All that statistic is saying is 97% of climate scientists agree the climate is changing and that humans have SOME effect on it. If a climate scientist said humans are .05% responsible or 100% responsible for climate change they considered that consensus. My point is within that 97% there’s a lot of disagreement as to how much humans contribute, with some saying a lot, and some saying not much.

And Antarctic ice is still growing by billions of tons a year, just a bit slower than before. To be critical of these skeptics though, you can’t care about humans without caring about the environment, as we rely on ecosystems in nature for our own survival so if plants and animals suffer, we suffer.

They are a piece of the puzzle but not the whole thing. Just because fossil fuels got us to where we are doesn&#39;t mean it is a good idea to stay on them indefinitely. We need more work on future generations of nuclear as well, there are some quite significant leaps that can be made in that field. And the one guy who says energy experts need to be part of the discussion is absolutely correct.	UCof2lh9ZwgR0ZFcG_tPUO0g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCof2lh9ZwgR0ZFcG_tPUO0g	0

Yes, the melting of the ice caps couldn&#39;t effect us, but who knows if it will effect other life that is essential for proper survival.<br /><br />Those fires in Australia and California, are NOT, by no means, small and something that is not caused by climate change. It has a very big role in these fires.<br /><br />It is true that ecosystems are being destroyed. The coral reefs, the forests, the ice in the poles.<br /><br />Even if this whole climate change thing is, as they say, &quot;nothing to worry about&quot;, we as the next generation have a job to take care of the Earth, regardless if climate change and other problems are really effecting it. It shows we care for our generation and the generations after us. It wouldn&#39;t hurt to just believe that we need to take care of the Earth, regardless if you believe that this isn&#39;t true or that is.

And if we don’t change what we are doing the carbon ppm will get over 500 and we are all screwed<br /><br />Edit :<br />While fossil fuels helped us get here now they’re ruining it. <br />aHa AlSO<br />Miss we have no room for reusable energy <br /><br />Well where are you gonna get your fossil fuels from? 🤔<br />Do you have your own infinite supply..? Because.... that stuff kinda takes a while to make you know... just a hundred million years <br />Yeah that will work out <br /><br />And yes the environment will get worse because greenhouse gases last a long time you see, for example some live thousands of years, when a new GHG comes another doesn’t just go away. So if you keep using things like <b>fossil fuels</b> so many GHGs will be in the atmosphere things will get insane. <br />For example, if the weather becomes too extreme and the ice caps melt, the sea level will become a lot higher. Higher sea level means that an earthquake which wouldn’t have been a big deal before, now might cause a tsunami. Causing mass destruction and guess what!! Worse human environment too, mr glasses!

I believe every animal (generally speaking) is equal. The main factor that separates humans from every other species is complex thinking. We aren’t as superior as so many people believe we are. Thousands if not millions of Humans get killed by other animals, plants and diseases each year. As the food chain goes, we’re not at the top. We have just been able to eventually adapt to the conditions. Also, money has value because we give it value. Bartering systems have been in use for thousands of years and even though it is a necessary system it shouldn’t be exploited. I absolutely believe if someone is putting in more work that person should be compensated accordingly but that’s not exactly how things work in today’s society. There are a select number of fields that are given the spotlight but then arguably equally (if not more) important fields such as education is barely compensated enough to live.

What do we do when that supply runs out and we need to utilize another form of energy? And should we wait until the very last moment before we start preparing for and adapting to that change? Also, if you&#39;re a humanist and a human centric person I don&#39;t understand how you can not care about the environment or the health of our planet considering our very existence depends on it. Humans are not above and separate from nature, we are a small fragment of it.	UCUuwL4ygWYzAeBWorCWsSFg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUuwL4ygWYzAeBWorCWsSFg	0

So like either the production process or the materials that goes into the product. But that would probably cost a lot of money and coming from a country that does focus a lot on environmentalism, I think the government should play a bigger part in not just paying Co2 kvotes or whatever but reinventing certain products, like idk making all 1 use cups eco friendly instead of just wasting plenty of plastic	UCKRPG0M6_PloMv3O44uQy6w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKRPG0M6_PloMv3O44uQy6w	1	UgwyY5LLqXdsnOh9oTV4AaABAg	Bella Payne

I live in California and I&#39;ve seen my communities get burned down (and yes I know it&#39;s a very flammable area and it&#39;s prone to fires), but denying that climate change has something to do with it is to tell my communities and everyone in Australia and even the indigenous tribes of the Amazon that they&#39;re worried about nothing.

The question is how long can our resources last before we need alternatives. Before oil the big scare was that we would run out of coal and therefore not be able to travel (trains were the cool new transportation then). Of course we then discovered oil in Pennsylvania. If there was a shortage, you wouldn’t see anyone putting up a fight when alternatives get suggested. To this day nobody hates most alternatives, what conservatives dislike is being forced into more expensive and/or less convenient lifestyles in the name of shortage which is not realistic in the near future.

And it is this sort of dialogue that makes it so much harder to get out real science to people who aren&#39;t climate scientists. Please, please, please, consider adding a fact-checking element to any sort of video along these lines i the future. Yes, we should always treat our neighbors with respect and kindness, but the sort of baseless claims being made by the participants in this video are dangerous, and they need to be offset with reality.

It was 13 hectares of land, 1 billion animals dead, 2500 homes lost. It’s so offensive for him to say that when he doesn’t live in Australia and hasn’t truly seen the extent of it. There were fires near where I live and I tell you, they weren’t little. Do I believe climate change caused them? No but don’t diminish the severity of something just so you can prove a point.

First, it takes a very ignorant person to deny climate change or deny the importance of it. We are not the only beings on this earth. Just because we are the most advanced does not mean that we should not doing anything. Just because the constitution doesn’t scream climate change, doesn’t mean it’s not important. Climate change wasn’t an issue even considered in the 1800s, so why would it be included in the constitution? Restricting ARs is not written in the constitution, but these are still issues we have to discuss. Also, science... SCIENCE says that climate change does exist and the evidence shows that our climate is decreasing in quality. Currently, international politics prioritize economy over most everything else. We need to make a change that might sacrifice some production or cause some things to be more expensive so that we CAN respect other species that do not belong to us but are being strongly affected by it.

Just because you are not negatively affected in your everyday life (as of now), doesn&#39;t mean it is something &quot;we shouldn&#39;t worry about.&quot; The environment isn&#39;t isolated, everything is connected, humans are part of the environment and we need to start thinking about how we can sustainably live or else we are all fucked.

If these people are wrong then we could be destroying ourselves, the planet and everything on it - if they are right then the worst that could happen through us doing something is we just return to ow we were with new evidence.

It’s interesting to see how the older portion of humanity views climate change. Of course the earth’s climate changes, and it’s hard to know how much humans are changing the climate. BUT we can agree for a fact we are changing the earth in one way or another. I think the fear of how people will address this problem is what makes some have a “climate skepticism” viewpoint. We don’t need a more controlling government to make a difference. Telling people to plant more trees, shop locally, and planting more native plants makes an impact too, despite how small it may be. Many environmental solutions have promising economical and social benefits if people would sit down and listen.	UCbTrEdfq6TrBiiIUuosS33w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbTrEdfq6TrBiiIUuosS33w	0

Personally I believe the planet is warming too quickly, greenhouse gases are being pumped out too fast, and effects of that can be seen. The only area where I disagree with a lot of people is when they want DRASTIC action. With people like in the video you can&#39;t just force everyone (in America) to either care, be informed, or try to reduce their carbon footprint. They will never listen so I see it as a lost cause. Would I like to? Yes. Is it possible? Call me when these people have either died or are in a coma.	UCcBz3FhXrAYxs9gIleBwcQA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcBz3FhXrAYxs9gIleBwcQA	0

All energy comes from goes to the SUN. Earth is a 4.5 billion year old closed loop that self regulates co2 with LIFE Co2 is all encompassing. It reflects out as much energy as it reflects in. Earth is a 4.5 billion year old closed loop that self regulates co2 with LIFE. The climate cycles of our planet are continental glaciers with lower sea levels brought on by Global tsunami's. The changes in the tilt of the earths axis, north star and proximity to the SUN causes ClimateChange. Global warming The more the axis of the earth tilts towards the sun. The more DIRECT sunlight the higher latitudes poles receive. Warming the southern hemisphere heat sink oceans and thawing the northern hemisphere frozen co2 continents. Which is why temperature rises first and co2 follows. Cause and effect. Every 13 k years when the Precession of the north star aligns the equator with the solar orbital plane at the ecliptic's. The gravitational pull of the SUN pulls tsunami's around the planet East to west because the planet spins west to east. It happened before it will happen again. Not if but when. The one off with the slow rise of sea levels after the global tsunami's is the Zanclean flood of Noah in the Mediterranean.

I'm not saying it doesn't happen but your claim basically says that human curiosity and thirst for knowledge doesn't exist, or that scientists have never started a study with a hypothesis and found they were wrong. 2) Can you provide any evidence for what you're saying? That scientists who have studied climate change were all paid to say things? Who is paying them? And what do they gain by people supporting climate change, lowering CO2 emissions, and using renewable resources?

Her position is there is a lot of uncertainty in the models, they predominantly overestimate the effect of CO2 on climate, and alarmism is unwarranted. There are MANY climate scientists, and scientists from related disciplines, that agree with Dr. Curry.

López If that small number concerns you, you should look behind the famous "97% percent of climate scientists agree with climate change" claim. It first appeared as a poll of ~1800 scientists, only 77 of which were even climate scientists. Then another "97% agree" survey came out, but only vaguely asked the question about human influenced climate change. And the 'consensus' came from a cherry picked set of research papers, some of which didn't even necessarily conclude what the surveyor implied. Even if the paper was neutral or agreed only with marginal human _contribution_ to otherwise natural climate change, it was included with the 'Anthropomorphic Global Warming' "consensus". Yet those papers would be considered pseudo-science by the very people the survey was meant to mislead. And many of the scientists behind those papers criticized the survey, but that didn't stop NASA from citing a cartoonist's blog as holy gospel.

Climate Change isn&#39;t mentioned because the writers of it&#39;s books didn&#39;t know it would come to pass and again I mention that God has said WE are to tend and keep.

How can you say you’re well informed and that you’ve done research from both perspectives and then proceed to say we as humans have absolutely nothing to do with the polar ice caps melting? Yes it is a natural process over millions of years where the earth goes through periods of warming and cooling, but it takes 10 minutes to learn how much we effect it, even if just a little. Burning fossil fuels releases CO2, a greenhouse gas. Named so because it traps solar radiation instead of releasing it back into space like oxygen and nitrogen does. As greenhouse gases increase they trap more heat and warm the planet and decrease albedo. That is basic knowledge with barely and research and this is only one aspect. They way they approach these prompts is all from the perspective of humans and money and mostly ignorant.	UCtJQ8MnfRqAv6g-saGcQ8ig	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtJQ8MnfRqAv6g-saGcQ8ig	0

With the knowledge i learned in this class it seems as if most of the participants are uninformed on the actual effects climate change will cause and exactly how we affect the climate. Here are just a few of the dangers that come from global warming: rising sea level (the amount depends on if we lower emissions), increased frequency of wildfires, increased frequency and intensity of flooding, and MANY more. A good source of informations are IPCC reports, which is a summary for policy makers on climate change data	UC38x9DXc5Vzh3eNasyV2m5w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC38x9DXc5Vzh3eNasyV2m5w	0

As a scientist, there is no other side to climate change. It’s happening, and we’re contributing to it in no small way. Giving a platform to deniers is not the same as seeing the range of views or experiences of people with disability, or HIV, or cheaters. What would have been interesting is to get different experts and see what they thought would be the best way to cope with new challenges brought on by climate change, because the fossil fuel guy isn’t wrong that you need a range of experts to deliver energy, clean water, waste management, etc.	UC1W-sCJb3fmvArJPoOsjg5A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1W-sCJb3fmvArJPoOsjg5A	0

It really would be interesting if they had to put together the chain reactions of our human actions into the environment. And of course the fossil fuel advocate will advocate for fossil fuel and question climate change since that is clearly his job and career right now. And like why are they putting a martial arts teacher and an architectural drafter in this....mans couldn’t even be an actual architect damn. But their life’s are probably not directly impacted by the changes in climate and of course you won’t see these patterns again since they are all old reaching their death beds.

As for fires, the California ones are due to terrible legislation that prevented people from taking care of the forest by removing all the dead wood/brush (not do to climate change). The Australia fire was larsony, not climate change. Read up on the lives of the pilgrims and compare it to today to see how easy we have it.

Studies that gather statics can still be slightly biased and that's you its important to use a variety of sources. Also, if you love statistics so much, there are plenty of studies about how left leaning biased universities are.

Try going to government websites to get statistics on a topic or reading an *informative* scholarly article. I'm scared of the sources you used in papers if that's your thought process. Yes, it is true, no *NEWS* source is unbiased. But saying "there are no unbiased sources" is an ignorant and uneducated comment. For example, going to a .gov to get a statistic for the percentage of people who eat apples in America. A completely unbiased source. Or finding from an auto company about how many tires they've sold in a single year. The list goes on and on of unbiased sources. Statistics naturally by themselves are usually unbiased until someone twists them to be something else.

The earth goes through natural cycles. That's why we has an ice age. The earth is evolving and changing the whole time. We are moving towards a different age. Yes less pollution is always good and yes we have to clean up the oceans and rebuild and recycle. But all of the natural disasters that's happening isn't because of humans, it's just how the earth works.

So they'll attempt to recontextualize whatever their bigotry or ignorance is, obfuscating the intent of the label, e.g. "I'm not racist; I believe in self-defense/closed borders/living with your own culture/whatever". Only "bad" label I can recall in recent memory being used self-declaratively and openly was Benedict Donald calling himself "nationalist" in 2018.

The world will repair itself after thousands or millions years so the nature will restore and the world would be clean. The ironic part is that most “climate activists” want a clean world so?

Earth being round, climate change being real- all these are facts. I don't know if you're familiar with the concept of 'axiom' in mathematics. It's the basic set of rules every single mathematician agrees on like '2+2 = 4' and division by zero cannot be done etc. Because there's a consensus there, math has advanced so high up to differentials and integrals and even more complicated concepts. Facts are like that. Unless everyone (or at least 90-95% of the people) agree with them, then we cannot move forward with any dialogue. Personally I believe we shouldn't even entertain a dialogue with these idiots. If they say 'Climate change is not real', we say 'It is', they'll say 'It is not' and we continue the conversation, that's bad. Just ignore the morons and do our bit to protect the planet.

There’s lots of things that would cause us to die." Resources are created. You don't "use up" resources. Oil is not a natural resource. For most of man's history, it was worthless and actually a negative (it would get in your way when you were drilling for water). It actually lowered land values. It only became a resource when people figured out how to use it. You create resources, you don't "use them up". "One being not utilising green energy, climate change will make a lot of people die." Not true. What is better, having an unchanging climate or building infrastructure that helps you survive in any climate. Obviously the second one. As we have used more and more fossil fuels, climate related deaths have plummeted because climate isn't this naturally safe thing that we make dangerous. It is a dangerous thing that we need alot of energy to protect ourselves against it. "My point being that there are others thing we can do that help humans coexist with our environment in a more peaceful symbiotic way rather than just statin that if we don’t take full advantage of the land and resources the human race will perish, its such a reductionist statement and he’s just using it to push his agenda" What does "full advantage" mean?

If it did, you wouldn't have to build it. Food is planted. That isn't what was growing there before. You make clothes. Those didn't exist in the forest somewhere that you found. All of those things all the way up to building a skyscraper is about changing the natural environment to be more suitable for humans. I think you have a very concrete bound idea of what is meant by "environment". Environment doesn't just mean CO2. That actually has very little to do with the environment around you.

Earth was not made for humans, Earth was not made for humans to rule it and Earth certainly did not need humans to to management it. How much more do we need as a species do we really need new phones, cars, clothes, and bananas we get this stuff every year? I challenge everybody to do a comprehensive ecological footprint. Mine was 4.2 earths and i actually try to mitigate my impact. Climate change but consumerism is the issue. Shows like Wall-E predict a very real future for Earth theres too many variables to put in one youtube comment. Do your fact check is all i can say .

We are going through a mass extinction right now and a lot of it is due to climate but at the same time I strongly believe that what is happening is natural of the earth. The earth was once tropical, it was once completely frozen over. As time changes the planet changes and that will never stop happening no matter how hard we try but I really love life and nature and I wish we could slow it down or try to work in a way where we could preserve things that matter but also let nature run it’s course.

The majority of humans will go extinct in this process and only then will the world heal itself. So yes, the world might not be inevitably destroyed by climate change, but that will only be because we will die first. Our systems of pollution will die first. Our cars, homes, trains, schools, will die first. Animals will die and the biggest animal of all, humans, will die too.

However, in the US (probably there as well but I don't know their policies), control burns (which gets rid of all the dead brush while it is manageable) have been outlawed. Thus, after years and years of dead brush/wood building up over time (as well as a long period of dry seasons that is part of the natural cycle of the earth), we are now having larger forest fires than before. Thus, the environmental legislation actually set up the perfect place for huge forest fires to take place. Also, the Australia fire was caused by people, not "climate change".

The people on the right are reasonable, smart people who do the right thing. If there are facts placed in front of you that are irrefutable, then of course you were wrong and your mind is changed. To the people on the left, they are close minded, and those people you can’t bring to a Socratic conversation. At the end of the conversation, those are the people that say, “I understand but I still think I am right.” Who likes those people? No one. It’s uneducated to have all the answers smacking you in the face and still not believe it.	UCsy4sUxEj98_jEkhl2tSb2A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsy4sUxEj98_jEkhl2tSb2A	0

It's people like you, and well, republicans that are making it political. It shouldn't be, Climate Change is a scientific fact, not a belief. Physics has proven this, if everyone was educated in this field and looked at the scientific literature, you'd realize it's a pressing issue, and will ultimately affect us all, thus you wouldn't make such an absurd assertion. The only reason this is political is because enforcing environmentally friendly policies would damage the economy to some degree, and would damage the fossil fuel industry's profit margin, contradicting the republican's agenda. These people are clearly the victim of extreme right-wing propaganda, from either republican parties themselves or media outlets. I'm really not a conservative nor a liberal as they both have their flaws, but it's Climate Change is a pressing issue. Temperatures will substantially rise, natural disasters will become more powerful and frequent, ultimately killing us within 200 years at the rate we're going, and credible, non bias scientists have proven this, not just some random nutters.

I’m sorry but I do not see the horrible things humans do and have been doing to the planet a “positive” thing for humans. I am not implying we shouldn’t care about human beings, obviously. My whole point is, we, us, human beings, can not survive without THIS planet. And btw I have looked into it. Do I believe what the media portrays about “oh no we’re going to be extinct in x amount of years everyone freak out”.....no. As someone who leans more to the right politically, (a little off topic but I think it plays into the discussion), I really don’t actually believe the mass majority of what the media says. The media reallllyyyyy likes to uhm, “emphasize” the climate topic. With that being said, it’s so very obvious and can’t be ignored that we are harming the planet to an extent and I wish more people seen it as an actual issue.

You realize that if he doesn't agree with this premise, then what you said makes no sense. Maybe it isn't a matter of what he cares about, its a matter of what he thinks. :) "My point Damon, is that if Alex is so interested in humans sticking around, maybe he should care as much, if not more, about the very planet that holds humanity in the palm of its hand that allows us to flourish." The planet doesn't "allow" us to flourish. It isn't our mother. The planet untouched by man is terrible for human beings. What does caring about the planet "more" than human beings mean? See he is saying he cares about the planet BECAUSE human beings (ultimately himself) lives there. Therefore we should maximize the positives and minimize the negatives for human beings. Saying you care more about the planet (whatever that means) means telling human beings they cannot change the planet, when that is how human beings survive. Also, look into the climate research on this. Nobody serious thinks the earth is going to be "destroyed". Nobody who has an inkling of history thinks that either.

This new attitude towards entrepreneurship is beneficial if we want to make sure that our planet is healthy for many generations to come.

Maybe it’s just time that humans become extinct because that’s the natural order of things. What makes humans more important than any of animal species that is currently going extinct because of us.

It’s not even a speculation it’s cold hard facts. We can look back through ice and sedimentary drilling in Antarctica and see that c02 levels were the same during the Pliocene and that resulted in the loss of the ice sheet. We are locked in for this and we can already see it happening. Get ready for 4-5m if sea level rise over the next few decades.

(it keeps going all the way to the shops you go to and that's only a minuscule part of the Web as a lack of fish would also affect sea birds, sharks and meny more which in turn loops back to hundreds of other animals including humans)	UCHel7D4ov9l2F5mi0iXJIiQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHel7D4ov9l2F5mi0iXJIiQ	1	UgyOAPWloIiMm57sLSF4AaABAg	PiratesLuvRum

Animals are mass produce to feed millions and subjected to medical experiments to contribute to medicines. The time of existence of an animal or material doesn't affect their contribution to humanity. Because if something can be useful to humanity or transform to; thus, it exists to the benefit of humankind regardless of time. Creativity and intelligence trumps natural borders; allows the manipulation of all things. Therefore, everything does revolve around humans.

So many people saying none of us were actually scientists. First of all, who said we were or needed to be? Can regular people not have an opinion on climate change? No one said we&#39;re here to educate you or inform you. No one asked me if I was a scientist when they cast me. No one is pretending to be a scientist. Secondly, do any of you have a background in science? Then how can you say your opinion is any more valid than ours? That makes zero sense. If someone has to have a degree in science to talk about climate change then 98% of you shouldn&#39;t be allowed to comment, which is preposterous. <br /><br />Anyway it was a fun time. Thanks for all the really nice (often hilarious) comments about me. Don&#39;t let this video ruin you. It&#39;s just a video with a few opinions. You don&#39;t have to hate. People can disagree and it will be ok. Keith&#39;s bear comment was a little flippant and probably a little in jest. I doubt he actually believes that. Free speech is a great thing even if you disagree. If you shut down others opinions how can say you have the right to your own? Thanks for watching! I appreciate being a part of Jubilee. It was fun.

Also, you think your ancestors had clean air? Do you know how people warmed themselves in the past? Burning wood. That is worse for you than anything fossil fuels do today.

I think this argument is actually true. 100 years ago there were numerous wars, countries invading countries without their consent or as described by Voltaire and other authors religious people killing numerous other people on the simple belief that they would be a sorcerer and could not prove innocence because they could not breathe under water for more than 2 minutes for example. There was also segregation or whole lots of populations who were wiped out off the face of the earth. These things are impossible today [though some do exist in some places of the world at some extent] in democratic countries. No one in today's era can say they are having it as bad as some of our grand grand parents. Things can definitively improve however.

Yeah, because everybody knows murder is bad, and you dont have to be a rocket scientist to understand why that is. Its not bias for everyone to be on the same side of an issue when that issue is literally one sided lol.

For humans to survive, the ice caps need to be maintained to maintain a decreasing amount of fresh water for a growing population. <br />Yes there are periods of heating and cooling however the extent that this is occurring and the consistent temperature increase in the artic is very concerning. Also if the polar bears were to go extinct it would be another hit to the food web, causing a rift within the environmental hierarchy. <br />Fossil fuels will inevitably run out because they are not a replenishing resource. We should look to greener methods so we are not caught with our pants down when they start to dwindle. Also, humans jumped the hierarchy and made themselves the worlds central focus. I agree with protecting ourselves but an environmental collapse will not protect us since food and other resources will be disrupted and decrease in availability, especially for citizens of the world who have a lower socio economic status.

Save a ton of money, just chill and keep doing as we were before. But...what if in the end, billions on people suffer and die, economies taking heavy damage, life no longer possible as before, no more resources to use...and we realize that we actually did cause all this by ourselves? You could be likely on of the dead.<br /><br /><br />2. Listen to the activists. We get our ass up and act, change our way of life a little bit, become energy independent, live in harmony with nature, live healthy without toxic fumes, and much more. Way less people die because of our doings. Billions of people living healthy lifes. <br /><br /><br />What would you like more: A scenario where you may die and billions of people possibly suffering, or a scenario where the world economy is flourishing for decades and centuries and humans living healthy and good lifes?

Third world countries still exist. There are so many families living in poverty. When natural disasters become more frequent (due to climate change) and tear through villages, those people won&#39;t have the means to recover. They are arguing about being pro-human but they seem to only care about humans that already have good conditions and already have wealth without thinking about people who would be incredibly affected by climate change.

The issues with the climate should not be studied on the basis of a few hundreds of years exclusively. You need to go way further back than that. You need to look at climate change that is not the result of anthropogenic contribution and see just how this has affected life and species on Earth. This is proof that climate change can be disastrous - even when it is naturally occurring. The only difference now is that humans are contributing to changes in climate and there is significant evidence for this. Why would anyone think that these unprecedented but extremely impactful human changes are less likely to result in disaster than naturally occurring changes?

Colonialisation and mass genocides. 18th century: Violent recolutions and slavery 17th century: A religious war that lasted for thirty years. People being hunged because of their beliefs and millions dying. A small ice age 16th century: Smallpox in America and massacres caused by colonialism. Many religious conflicts. I could go on and on but i think that you get the point. Not only is the age we are living in more peaceful, it is also more advanced: Many diseases have been eradicated due to advances in medicine.

Like, why should we just say "because things are better now, we shouldn't complain" if we didn't freaking complain they wouldn't of gotten better. Bitching is how things move forward. Complaining is good, it means something isn't satisfactory, it's how we grow. More opportunities is insanely false. There is a bottle neck for change and growth and we hit it.

Just because another person is not able to make more environmentally friendly choices does not mean that those of us who CAN make better choices should not. Those in less developed countries or even those in lower socioeconomic status definitely have more challenges when trying to be environmentally conscious. I think emboldening leaders that are progressive is important in helping to close wealth inequities. Affording people basic human rights, like a job that provides a living wage, universal health care, and affordable housing can give individuals and families more financial freedom to do things like purchase healthy groceries rather than fast food. I in no way expect everyone in every country to immediately have the ability to be 100% “green”, but I do think it’s something we could gradually work toward on the global scale.

It is possible for us to take these feel-good measures like driving a car that is fuel efficient. People in China, India, and other developing countries don’t have that choice. Until those countries are more developed, it would be ridiculous to ask them to freeze to death in order to stop burning wood and coal. The answer is ironic really... the answer is to drill and give them the boost financially that they need to be rich like us. What gave us so much power? Capitalism and oil.

The community of climate change skeptics grows in a society where these INCORRECT ideologies are given a platform to express any idea they choose and no one bats an eye. On what bases can you makes any claims if you avoid the ACTUALITY OF SCIENCE or pick out pieces of science and twist them to say what you want them to say. THESE VIDEOS are allowing skeptics to have a platform to put out ideas that other people who are a little skeptical will see and go, ‘that makes sense to me, i’m gunna use those same ideas to support myself now as a climate change skeptic’ i’m sorry but to an extent i think some these videos are using the internet to spread false information and make people feel that they belong to a group. and that’s on perioddt.

I am currently studying climate change in Canada and I can confirm the only reason the planet is warming at such an alarming rate, is a direct correlation between our GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions and increased levels of CO2 in the atmosphere (which are created by the use of fossil fuels). No other force on the planet or in our atmosphere has the power to alter the climate as we have in the past 100 years; therefore it is up to us to reverse the effects we humans have created.

High density housing is one area that would struggle to have solar help much with power as you have much less roof space per household. All of these options are available and we should take advantage of them, and they’re also pretty costly. Even with government subsidies, it takes about 10 years for one household’s solar panel installation to break even financially. To implement ubiquitous solar and wind in the US would cost us trillions of dollars each year. For the whole world, it would probably be quadrillions of dollars each year. We should implement it but we just don’t have the financial or manpower resources to implement it quickly.

It's free energy because no one controls the sun and because it's coming from a naturally occurring source nature has had time to adjust to, it's not damaging to us or others. Yes, we should always discuss pros and cons and do what we can to limit inconvenience or damage, but good god it is so incorrect to say alternative fuels are doing more damage than good.

Like that alone if everyone did it and shared spill over for free would give plenty of energy to the 1st world countries that use up the most. Apartments could have them, homes could have them and there would be a collective pool of energy shared in each place. You wouldn't even pay for it and you could either keep up your own panels if you are a home owner, or your landlord would replace and clean them. We have so many options it's not even funny. But our real issue is that we have an individualistic minded static culture not build for moving forward or going through change. Technology has forced it, which is good, we need MORE of that.

Engineers can’t figure out how the batteries/energy storage for solar would work without resulting in massive energy loss. And wind is super inefficient and is dangerous to bird populations. I think a compromise would be nuclear energy solutions. If we give Nuclear energy some R&D we can work out the kinks and ensure safe, renewable nuclear energy with no worry about radiation or meltdowns. Nuclear plants are 95% renewable and the waste is minimal and usually well secured.

Morgan was pointing out that this was a completely false claim as it wouldn't actually require that much land and considering how much of it is unusable for humans, the size of land it would take up would not be the issue.

When they were originally killed off, the antelope and deer population ran rampant and devoured everything. Once they were reintroduced in the early 90s the population went down and the forests began to grow back as well as the bushes. The wolves balanced out the ecosystem.

Population has been increasing for the last 20 years despite so called 'warming' and warnings of them going extinct by 2012 or smth. It was a rhetorical question. His stance simply meant if they do go extinct it's due to law of nature. Because species they come and they go and always still manages to maintain the balance in the ecosystem. So if it happens, which most definitely will not in our lifetime, some other species will have taken its place or something else happens so the system remains intact. That has always been the beauty of nature. Like hello, if dinosaurs never went extinct we all wouldn't be here now watching this .

Some take much much longer to occur. However adapting in that sense is not much of a factor when discussing the removal of keystone species. I recommend looking up Robert Paine's studies. The removal of a keystone species (or similarly highly impactful species) can drastically change the entire ecosystem and not every species will be able to adapt and or survive in the new system.

I get that these videos are meant to represent voices of &quot;ordinary people&quot; but... Surely there is better than this.<br /><br />I hope a new batch of conservatives can come on and the people with the misplaced confidence to keep coming back can be rotated out.

The only way satellites could possibly be accurate in their measurements of the surface is if all clouds would disappear. In lieu of the absence of clouds thermometer measurements wpuld be needed. Where are the thermometers in the middle of Africa, South America and the Pacific Ocean? There arent any! The global mean temperature is a homogenized number, a guess. Also, can you explain to me why CO2 is a pollutant? And lastly will you read the moral case for fossil fuels? Oh by the way, did you know that in the presence of Oxygen, Methane decomposes into Carbon Dioxide and water vapor? Due to this methane concentrations in the atmosphere are even smaller than CO2.

In 2020. In a rich country. <br />Or maybe they are just lacking love. Love for our planet. Love for our environment. Love for animals.

Several of the members in this discussion completely overlook and ignore scientific data. Alex Epstein literally founded an organization, funded by Big Oil (Specifically the Koch Brothers) that&#39;s intent is to justify and assert that carbon emissions are good for man kind and that human consumption of fossil fuels is beneficial and not harmful to the environment. Just as an example, Alex also happens to not have a scientific degree rather a philosophy degree. The individuals considering themselves to be well-informed in this video or &quot;experts&quot; have no actual credibility, and the fact that not a shred of evidence to help support the climate change denialism movement was mentioned only furthers my point. These individuals despite possible well intentions, are not a credible nor reliable source, until they actively publish peer-reviewed studies documenting the lack of evidence for climate change or &quot;debunking&quot; it, they shouldn&#39;t be credited and/or supported in their movement.

Another problem is that only 2.5% of all the water on earth is freshwater, of that 2.5%, 68.7% is from glaciers and ice caps (source from the research of hydrologist Igor Shiklomanov in a book called "Water in Crisis"). Melting water from melting ice caps go into the ocean and becomes contaminated with salt. If that doesn't matter to them, they should know that ice caps reflect a significant amount of sunlight, and if there is less ice, more sunlight will be absorbed into the ground and it will heat even more. And also, aquafers (water underground) are decreasing in size because of the amount we take from them (wells and pumps). Coastal areas like Florida can't even get freshwater from aquafers because the ground is too close to the ocean and the aquafers become contaminated with ocean water. This means they need to import mass amounts of water for use.	UCndAbT3hUDmivIq5mUbdEBA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCndAbT3hUDmivIq5mUbdEBA	1	Ugwiyy0--2OpU54WeDZ4AaABAg	Billy K

What is most frightening is the complete faith to anthroprocentric ideals, as well as the disdain toward animism and a worship of the earth. This truly highlights the subjectivity of the word “progress.” I imagine my definition is very different from theirs. For anyone who wants a book that essentially is the opposite of what was said here, I recommend “The More Beautiful World our Hearts know is Possible” by Charles Eisenstein.

I understand their point of view (i don&#39;t agree with it). These people care a lot more about human comfort and human protection than they care about climate change or the environment. This gives another way that we can talk about climate change to the deniers. Explain to them that climate change is not only harmful to polar bears but it is going to hurt humans too and it has already started hurting. The ads for pro climate change should talk about human stories getting affected rather than the animal ones.<br /><br /><br />@jubilee amazing work in keeping this unbiased.

The little sorry excuses for nuclear power we do use now, is definitely not what I am referring to. We could already have proper nuclear power if one side of the government wasn't constantly trying to protect and prop up the fossil fuel industries, and the other side wasn't trying to divert and scam people by having them invest their time, energy, and money into promises of mediocre forms of clean and renewable energy, while behind the scenes also protecting and proping up fossil fuel industries themselves. Two sides of the same coin. No one in government is actually trying to progress our energy systems. Fossil fuels are far too profitable.

I think I just need to say that all of you need to read some actual scientific studies rather than making assumptions and basing your opinions as facts. You say that you don&#39;t fully trust what the media is telling you and frankly I don&#39;t either, but the media isn&#39;t where you should go to get any type of valuable information. Where you should go is the scientific papers that the media may or may not be referencing. Read the papers that look at(/are) real studies on climate change in all of its factors, and you will see ACTUAL FACTS AND STATISTICS. Most of you also seem to argue that the earths climate has always fluctuated- from (ice age to thawed climate) but what&#39;s more if you actually read into the topic you will find this thawing period is exponentially more extreme than it has been in the history of earth. This factually its from the release of gas from fossil fuels and other pollutants. And since you all seem to care so much about being comfortable and about human beings coming first, then maybe you should think about the people outside of America (though you can find similar cases in America too) who&#39;s homes are becoming inhabitable through both extreme heat and sea level rise pushing their homes underwater. You may not care about what happens to the polar bears but do you care about them? With all that said I also can&#39;t help but say that your opinions and actions on this issue are selfish and very uninformed. I&#39;m 18 years old and I know more about the science of climate change and the fight against it than you do. <br />Once more rather than stating you opinions as facts and making assumptions do some actual research from reliable unbiased sources.

UgwFNG90JhVj78s1VRN4AaABAg	0	1	2020-03-06 23:12:17	Jimmy Heymann	&quot;First and foremost, do you really think this so-called switch will be practically possible in the modern world, considering the amount of energy consumption targets being met in the industrial sector alone. I think this scenario is extremely hypothetical with no validity. Secondly, use of renewable energy will not lead to any decrease in carbon dioxide emission rates.&quot; -University Professor from Bristol about switching from fossil fuels to renewable Energy.<br />&quot;This question should be rephrased and being asked if renewable energies can significantly reduce C02-eq output from the energy sector. And the answer here could be Yes. Energy from solar panels and from wind and water generators defenitly generate less C02 per produced energy unit if compared to oil, coal or waste burning. In addition, we should be aware that there is more to learn about &#39;renewable energy sources&#39;! Nicolas Tesla (and other researchers) had proposed innovations that were never followed up, because the mainstream (and most economical model at that time) was burning coal and oil. I assume that &#39;investment in research&#39; related to renewables could result in more innovations that allow energy production with less C02-eq per produced energy unit if compared to renewables. To limit &#39;renewables&#39; to energy generation from biomass use would of course not allow significant C02 reduction since the earth surface is limited. If we would termintate the lately installed and existing renewable energy production capacity, we certainly would increase C02 emission from the enrgy sector if we do not reduce enegry consumption. Another trend to be pointed out is the &quot;energy efficieny&quot;. A lot of potential energy reduction is still possible here, and I suggest that related research and enhancement is linked to the trend to proceed with renewable development that aims to switch the energy sector as far as possible to reduce CO2 emissions. Even if set up of renewable energy production also generates C02 due to resources use, established, production and operation, the main factor will be if such operation generates less CO2eq if compared to fossil fuels.&quot; <br />This discussion goes on and on and everyone agrees and/or disagrees with each other.<br />Y&#39;all should look more into opposing and or conflicting viewpoints and not just dismiss them because you disagree.<br />If they don&#39;t change your mind, good for you, but at least you listened to someone with an opposing mindset and didn&#39;t just shut them down, calling them uneducated when even scientists have different mindsets on these topics.

All across modern recorded history, before this climate change hysteria broke out, all sorts of temperature records were being broken. I remember a few decades ago suffering through intense record breaking heat without AC long long before climate hysteria.....and long long before I or my parent's parents were born, temperature records were being broken. This idea that climate has ever been so stable that we shouldn't see these temperature changes is a falsehood. So to say that there's evidence that climate change caused 3/4 of the fires is such a vague claim. Climate plays a role in all sorts of things. The core misrepresentation is that man is the main culprit of such climate change and so much so, that the change in climate is world-ending. It's not. That's hysteria.

Not to mention basing your opinions on a 3000 year old book written by some homeless guy who was tripping on shrooms. <br /><br />It’s a shame that none of them see any problem with how they think purely because they won’t be around long enough to see the effects and how detrimental it will be on us and all other life on earth. WE ARE NOT THE ONLY SPECIES AND IN FACT, WE HAVE NO MORE RIGHT TO BE HERE THAN ANY OTHER. A developed frontal lobe doesn’t justify destroying entire eco systems for your leisure. Just think about what you’re saying and doing and have some respect for life other than yours.	UCposv-9FBD4gtXq_WdnMKSw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCposv-9FBD4gtXq_WdnMKSw	0

Delusional people often like calling rhemselves skeptics to appear smarter. Be skeptical of your own biases and your own ingrained thoughts; anybody can be skeptical about an opposing view, that&#39;s basic.

Rebel with out a cause, thinks it knows all and pretends nothing is wrong while it's dying inside. There is also a lot of "you are in, or you are out" high school clique culture and this incessant idea that it doesn't need to grow or change because "It's not a phase" America was a really great idea, especially had it acknowledged that while no one is perfect, it doesn't mean you don't strive to be, and that it can learn things from others while still being it's own thing. That would of been fine. Instead we have a kid who has not really suffered massive war and blood shed like many of the countries around it. All countries absolutely have their issues, but there are better and worse places. America is probably the worst 1st world country you could live in and when people contest that it's the best, they reference things like almost any country in Africa or The Middle East. Those aren't high bars to beat. Japan, Canada and most of Europe just conveniently don't exist when talking about that.

People don’t understand that we need to protect our ecosystems to survive. If we destroy our ecosystems, we lose all of its resources. There is no way to manufacture earths natural ecosystem services. And to the man who said “there are many bears...” you truly are a small thinker. If you lose a species, in any ecosystem, that very well can lead to a collapse (especially a keystone species like a polar bear) how is the youth supposed to stay hopeful when past generations work against our progression.

He wants Americans and other 1st world humans to continue to live comfortably, in whatever manner they want to, and disregard the consequences. I did agree with his point about needing to take into consideration that if you limit the use of fossil fuels you have to talk about how that will effect everyone and the alternative methods to take. Yes, that needs to be a big part of the conversation. We need to invest in alternative methods of energy production, specifically ones that will reduce the harm of the planet. We don't have to stick to just 1 type of energy.	UClkul3eZZbgV7y0KyDrECEQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UClkul3eZZbgV7y0KyDrECEQ	1	Ugy7DKyn6tcFOLnx9v14AaABAg	Maple Syrup

Earth rarely has icy poles throughout her history. Check it out. I was amazed when I found that out. I think it is about 10% of earths history has been as cold as it is right now. So we would naturally be due for warming anyways. <br />That being said, I do not want to see more oil wars, oil spills in lakes or our oceans, or smog. I want to see us improve our air and water qualities while we transition to a more sustainable future.	UCYUQBu3Ef5qgWksKOA0iPjg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYUQBu3Ef5qgWksKOA0iPjg	0

I do not buy in to Al Gore or Greta&#39;s stories. It looks too much like a religion to me.<br />I do see oil wars happening in Iraq and Lybia, and pipeline wars in Syria and Afghanistan. We are having major pipeline protests here in Canada too. I do not want to give my money to oil wars or the oil industry. Solar looks like a better investment over time then fossil fuels or nuclear. Nuclear is too expensive to build and maintain in the first place compared to hydro, wind and solar. My human and money centred views have lead me to buy my own solar panels and batteries. <br /><br />I repeat, I am not pro Al Gore or Greta. I do not see the world through the same lens as they do. I am anti war and pro energy efficiency and energy independance. I think Medecine Hat Alberta Canada has a good system. They are rich in Natural gas, they are a gas town. They built a wind farm on the outskirts of the city and a Solar farm in the city. The solar farm is one with mirrors that boils water and turns turbines when the sun is shining. At night and on cloudy days they use natural gas to heat the water to turn the turbines.<br /><br />I am glad that Medecine Hat spent their money how they did rather then on aircraft carriers to invade other countries to take their resources. They provide us with a good example of how to make the most of what you have got	UCYUQBu3Ef5qgWksKOA0iPjg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYUQBu3Ef5qgWksKOA0iPjg	0

If you are saying smog is unhealthy and that we need trees and oxygen, then Alex and I would agree with you. Why would you even comment in the first place? "A previois comment said if we push the environment too far it becomes inhabitable for humans." What the hell does "push the environment" too far mean? The environment has never been better for human beings. "Sewage, flint's water, factories poisoning the land and causing inhabitants to become to sick seem like valid examples to me. But I guess you don't believe those events actually happen huh?" What? You honestly think I don't think anything in the entire world is poisonous? You seem to be a pretty dishonest person. 'You have a different conclusion because you have different premises. Therefore you don't think anything in the world is unhealthy'. There is no honest way you could think that about my position. You are a bad person. That doesn't make me right (the facts do) but it still is a reflection on you.

How do they expect us to be if they aren&#39;t. Also, yes fossil fuels have brought lots of benefits and developments but think how much the world has advanced since then. Fossil fuels allowed the formation of industries centuries ago, now we have the internet and so many more technological advancements that there are more approaches to creating energy. Just because it worked back then doesn&#39;t mean it is the answer now. <br /><br />If I&#39;m wrong feel free to come at me, I&#39;m very open minded.

I think piling more environmental regulations on American business or consumers is the wrong way to go about handling climate change. Nations like China and Indonesia pollute at an astronomical rate compared to the US, yet little seems to be done on that front. Greta spent all her time lecturing Western countries and gave little to no attention to African and Asian nations that are the heaviest polluters and contributors to climate change. Additionally, celebrities fly around the globe in private jets and high end cars yet they belittle ordinary people for keeping a well manicured lawn or eating beef and see that as a threat to the planet. Once the hypocrisy ends, and elites begin outright blaming problem countries with solutions, many other skeptics will begin to believe them. People (like me) are less inclined to believe the elites if they live in blanket hypocrisy.	UCCSX5Lk5phZ-tklmTYfrASg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCSX5Lk5phZ-tklmTYfrASg	0

We are surrounded by life that has been on this earth for millions of years before we even existed, now we&#39;re causing problems and destroying it for everyone. What right do we have to inflict that sort of destruction? And are we really going to not care when most species have gone extinct? When healthy trees and nature is a rare sight? When the oceans are just baths of plastic and no life? One of the many good qualities humans have had in common with many species not dissimilar to us, is empathy. Have we really lost that for any being outside of our kind? I don&#39;t think that&#39;s an option, because if it is then we don&#39;t deserve the power we hold.

Yes, global warming is real.This is a fact. The thing that is debated among people in the field, is if it is actually mankind that is causing it or not (which most researchers believe that we are). What is scary is that there are so much of the general public who will debate this, and they are the ones with the most influence. <br />Yes we can do something about it. We can try and take more public transportation rather than driving everywhere individually, we can invest in carbon capture and green energy solutions, we can promote eating less meat, there are many things we can do to combat this. However, people will have to change their way of life. This is not something everyone is willing to do. I mean even if you are unsure or do not think that it is real. Wouldn&#39;t it be best to at least try in case you are wrong? What is the harm in that?	UC9Rez2-IAXvk8k7GLioDqsg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9Rez2-IAXvk8k7GLioDqsg	0

John	​@vovakrivbass Heliocentrism was a scientific fact established by Copernicus around 1513 which was later reconfirmed by Johannes Kepler circa 1609 and "definitely validated" in 1703 by Galileo. Geocentrism was a belief and theory supported by the catholic church at the time based on little to no evidence. What I'm saying is these kinds of debates are nothing new. Science has always been challenged by individual beliefs. There's a reason why the 18th century or "century of Enlightenment" existed.

When Copernicus was jailed for demonstrating that the world is heliocentric as opposed to geocentric, latter which was supported by the catholic church. This was already in the 1500's.

By American definitions, white people consist of light-skinned, usually western people (US, EU, Scandinavia). Haitians would be considered coloured by this logic. So would Brazilians etc. Even within western countries predominantly consisting of 'white' people, the people of foreign ethnicity or coloured usually employ poorer stratifications. The reason is not interesting here. Moo Moo is simply pointing it out. If you are wealthy of any race AND with a low empathy and high intuition personality trait, you are likely to be indifferent about the situation unless it directly threatens your existence.

Where I live, climate change regulation & new law hits the hardest the poor people. For e.g. in the EU, they want to ban cars that are 10 years older, who do you think buys cheap cars that are used for more than 10 years? Poor people, if the law keeps going like that... poor people cannot afford to have a car or a transport, which reduces the chance of getting a job or any flexibility in life/career. They also want to introduce over time to buy only electric cars but the issue with using law to force people to buy stuff, it would make the demand for the be unstoppable, it would spike the prices for electric cars so much that poor people would not afford environmental friendly products. Environmental products always leads to more expensive products, especially when the government does it. There are plenty of other examples. Over all, you are really ignorant if you are asking that question. Poor people struggle to live day to day & by some miracle they might save or do something for their children. Climate change hurts poor people when the snotty elite nobles virtue signal crappy laws that is a drop of water in a tub in their finances... while no consideration for the poor people.

Climate change happens all the time. The planet will survive. But it is happening at an alarming rate. It has major impact on all living beings on the planet. Oceanlife, plantlife, animallife, and humans. They seem to forget the last one. Oceanice melting is not just catastrofic for the polarbears. If greenland melts it will forse the Gulf of Mexico to go in another direction. If all that ice melts and the sealevel rises, the ocean will claim land. I&#39;m not sure on the exact percentage, but I believe about 70 percent of humans live along coastal lines. Dry areas become even dryer. This means mass immigration. How are we as a species going to cope with billions of us having to migrate? Western countries are already complaining about immigration as it is. Remember the tsunami in Asia, years ago? This time the ocean will claim the land and not give it back. Most western countries aren&#39;t even prepared for this. A lot of the US will flood just the same. I live in the Netherlands. We are already below sealevel. We had a massive flood in the 20th century and will never underestimate the power of the ocean again.

Nature will do 'its thing' and eventually, we as a species will die out. Us humans are NOT evolving in a good way anymore. Everyone is kept alive, everyone procreates, no matter what illnesses you have. The human species is getting weaker and weaker with every generation. There is no natural selection anymore. Furthermore, we are more and more reliant on eachother. Being 'selfsustainable' is an illusion. I don't think the earth will die, I don't think we'll become extinct anytime soon. But I KNOW that we have been changing the atmosphere at an alarming rate and will have to deal with the consequenses of it. Us humans, completely reliant on eachother, but also utterly selfish.

Uh.... where in the world are you getting your information from? Anyway, we can&#39;t use it forever. As it stands right now, we will run out of oil before 2060, natural gas around the same time, and coal before 2100. We are simply not using it at a sustainable rate. And I bet she wouldn&#39;t want to live in one of the cities in China where the rivers are polluted and the air is thick with pollution. Also... she claimed wind and solar are not viable sources of energy for the future and that there is not enough space. First off, where is this coming from? There is a reason wind farms are popping up. It is viable over a longer period of time because the resource is renewable. And it seems like she forgot that nuclear power blows fossil fuels out of the water. The thing is that I want to see the use of Thorium rather than Uranium for power generation. But that&#39;s a different argument. I&#39;m also seeing way too many fallacies in the things that they&#39;re saying. Like the rich people argument. Like okay... There are also tons of fossil fuel companies that on the for fossil fuel side. You didn&#39;t really prove anything. Someone please come talk some sense into these people.

At least we havent reach that level of knowledge where we could entirely do it without current ecosystems. China tried to reforest its desert with small variation of trees, which is pretty successful until a disease killed billions of the trees and set the progress years back. We give our cattle, pigs, and chickens a huge doze of antibiotics to prevent outbreak in a very tightly packed population risking the rise of MDR microbes. A lot of our coastal ciities are sinking because people keep sucking water out of the land while adding pressure by building skycrapers on it. We have a proven, working environment and ecosystem. Why do we have to replace it when it's not broken?. Our knowledge clearly will not suffice to replace entire ecosystem and environment in any foreseeable future yet.

Cloning, genetic manipulations and new ways of animal production had already been established. So in a way the ecosystem can be ignored we already mass produce animals such as chickens, cows and pigs and even cloned a sheep. So when humanity will be absolutely self-sustain, is caring for and sustaining the natural environment be gone replace with human growth?

Implying “green government policy” will make it worse for humans. Human cause climate change makes it worse for humans, and not just in the future, we see it now. Food insecurities, drought, wild fire, pine beetle affecting logging, the list goes on and on. Essential if take these “experts” (as if) approach of inaction, more humans will be hurt then if we make change now. I will likely not suffer from serious affects in my life, I’m am fortunate to live in a developed country. But in the developing world, those people will be hit the hardest, without the resources to weather out the effects particularly as mentioned before, food insecurity.

You prioritise humans but then you forget that we depend on the environment. You say theories of the things that happened to the world is natural even though the only types of ice bergs melting is based on natural carbon dioxide or volcanos. So, how is it possible for the temperature of the planet increase so dramatically when we came up of the idea of burning. And the guy who said I love Nature. You are a hypocrite yourself. Anyone in the comments can disagree with me or change my view but you have to understand that we need this planet to stay alive so we don’t need to go to a different planet.

Developing economies will pollute more, every country goes through the same phase. Europe and the US had gone through the same phase during the industrial revolution and a little bit more around the 2nd ww. You cut trees, pollute water, land, burn huge amount of toxic fuels, thx to that you have a ripe economy you enjoy today. It's just then the world was a much greener place and it could still take the impact of our activities. China actually is pretty progressive with renewables installation and reforestation, if you see China's forest coverage it has actually increased a lot from decades ago.

Our laws are different, our resources and way of life is different. Also as South Africans we are definitely feeling the affects of climate change with the droughts, water shortages, and yes, load shedding impacts become far worse. Our annual temperatures are rising to the points where one of our biggest industries (agriculture) is being hit the hardest. Crops are dying quicker or struggle to grow. No one's saying become vegan or anything like that, but you surely realise that climate change is affecting us right now?

But I also feel where we can improve as humans to maintain a clean and healthy environment; we should...

Even if you do not care about the environment, we will eventually run out of fossil fuels. We only have a limited amount. Renewable energy sources like wind and solar are becoming cheaper and cheaper. Innovation in energy storage is only going to get better. We cannot think like we are still in the 1900s.

No one gets PISSED OFF and try to burn the whole system down?? That they just meekly keep their head down for what?

But the majority of air pollution comes from China and India. Not the United States. We dont need to wear masks in marjory cities here in the US. I realize that some people are wear masks, to not spread sickness. But the majority of people in major Chinesse cities are wearing them because of air pollution. Obviously the US is a big part of the problem, I completely agree. But India and China put way more pollution into the air than the US. The US is FAR from perfect, but I always see it used as a punching bag when other countries have FAR worse problems.

Its also interesting to me that people shamed Donald Trump for pulling out of the climate accord, but since its conception no participating country has come close to meeting their goals of reduction. In my opinion a lot of these leaders (especially Chinas) dont actually care about reducing emissions, its just good pr to be a part of a global organization that is claiming to want to help the climate issue. When it comes down to it leaders arent going to make drastic changes for possible future situations at the expense of what their people need now.

And we're not talking about a slight change here. We're talking about a dramatic decrease in poverty since the major advent of capitalism. As in approaching a 90 degree turn on a chart. So please spare us from your moral grandstanding. Not only is it not necessary, its completely ignorant as well.

I'm not sure if this will be the case because carbon free sources of energy are getting cheaper everyday, but it is probably true if the science and engineering does not progress.

Researches that show evidence of Climate Change due to humans activities: Lüthi et. al. (2008), Petit et. al. (1999), Dyurgerov and Meier (2000), and many many others. You can also check NASA website since they summarize stuff in a pretty easy way, unless you wish to claim NASA is lying as well and fabricated all of other researches not at all related to them, then I really cannot do anything else for you, and we'll agree to disagree. Have nice studies! And a nice day.	UCa4PE1agxCJkSFZBNsF--ZA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa4PE1agxCJkSFZBNsF--ZA	1	UgzKMLFMAXGetOHZrPF4AaABAg	Ari S.

They agreed that the ice caps are melting, they just aren't concerned about it. The point of a debate and this kind of video is to open your mind and to see where the other side is coming from. If you allow them to speak their mind, you'll have higher chances of changing it. That's why when you say "there is no debate" it'll just make the other side more stubborn and you just refuse to listen to some valid points that may have been made.

But for example, someone in Finance wont have the expertise to have a good formulated opinion on climate change, because its simply not in their field. A scientific consensus is where the majority of scientists of a specific field agree on something, but theres always other scientists that wont join this consesus and cause debate, and thats what we need.

When in 2008 there was a massive economic bubble due to toxic CDO's and whatnot, the complex formulas behind these financial vehicles IS science. Yet, may people were affected by their houses being considerably devalued and/or finding themselves on the streets because they could not support the charge of their credit. You might not be a financial mathematician to understand the intricacies of how a CDO but you can read and analyze the consequences and impact it has on your life. It's the exact same thing here. "your opinion wont count because well you dont have the knowledge to support your argument" - So why is the comment section open for discussion? Why does everybody not prove their scientific background before commenting on this thread? How were you able to form a pro-climate change opinion if you yourself were not able to understand the scientific articles? The world you live in is terrible because an opinion is just that an opinion. Furthermore, knowledge comes from experience. We all have life experience to argument on how the world changes before our eyes and the same world that science studies is the same that we see. The only difference is that science has a methodology that makes it impartial and efficient as opposed to the regular Joe babbling a few theories here and there [does not mean he is wrong in a non scientific environment on the consequences/finality]. "Thats why scientific debates must stay between scientists" - No because from scientific debates results policies that affect people's life. For instance, certain scientists argue that the world needs a complete and drastic change supported by some activists like Greta Thunberg. However, the first people to suffer from these changes will be the poorer ones. Absolutely nothing or very little is in place to help these people transition through a sustainable life. Like I always say, you are vegan until you have 5 children live in the bottom 1% and do not even have the financial means to buy a regular portion of meat for your family.

Science has many fields and sorry but if you have no knowledge in this specific science field then no, your opinion wont count because well you dont have the knowledge to support your argument. Science isnt about opinions its about FACTS and you need to know the FACTS before forging an opinion and unfortunately you need to do specific experiments with specific methods to conclude anything, which we cant do at home. Thats why scientific debates must stay between scientists, cause they have the knowledge to do so: they understand the methods, they understand scientific articles and can easily see whats wrong. Also, normal people can discuss but they cant understand scientific articles like scientists do. Thats the problem here.

No one is in the banking field when talking about how banks act or react to certain situations. You can't invalidate somebody's opinion just because they are not in a field otherwise we not qualified to talk about anything on this planet earth and videos like these would be complete useless. The reason why we are all able to talk about this is because everyone of us can comment on the consequences that would or result from climate change on a day to day basis. And, this is what we can comment. The fact for instance that if policies are passed for example for no car to be fossil fueled by next year, which I think would be a great idea, the normal Joe or graduate student looking for a job who really needs a car to commute for example do not have the means to buy a flashy $100 000 Tesla or whatnot. The mess around Greta Thunberg, the click-bait yet very hypocritical sermons by the main stream media etc. all these are very factual consequences on which you can build an opinion. These the factual consequences that we can comment and which participate in building the negative opinion of the people in the video. In general, I think when people tend to comment about things they do not really know about, they tend to comment about the consequences more than the cause in itself.

The other problem is, what is it that can be done about it.	UChdA5rBxqoUHcvJO2mvBamQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UChdA5rBxqoUHcvJO2mvBamQ	1	UgzBnj5iS3f6iazTg_F4AaABAg	Camila Martins

We see how much upheaval has been caused by mass migrations from Latin America and Syria. The future could have far worse instances of this. As for animals adapting, they well may, but it's important to understand that it takes thousands to millions of years for animals and ecosystems to adapt to new conditions. For humans it would be very hard too because we've developed up the current systems of farms, ports, and distributions chains over the course of centuries. We could not replicate the farm belt of the U.S. in Siberia overnight, for example.

It’s normal. I don’t believe we are contributing to climate change and if we are it is such an insignificant amount due to the fact that CO2 is not a common greenhouse gas, for example water vapour has a much much larger impact. After reading some comments, I feel that not everyone has researched and I can’t tell you enough how important it is to research yourself rather than just going by propaganda you see. I really recommend that people check out naomi seibt, she’s really insightful and highlights the science a lot. I just feel that Greta scaremongers more than actually speaking facts, or any science. I think it’s ridiculous to blame “global warming” for polar bears practicing cannibalism when it’s known that polar bears have always done this. Ice caps melt but hey did you know they also form? Australian bush fires happen, it’s not unusual, it’s sad but we do not contribute to why it is happening. I also want to mention that I once believed in global warming and was extremely interested in what we can do to help but as someone who has always been interested in science, I wanted to view the science behind it and it just didn’t add up. I think it’s fantastic that there is this burst of love for earth and trust me I love that people are ridding seas of thrash, recycling, veganism etc. it’s great however high taxes, talks of implementing unreliable energy’s like wind etc. that could end up with a world blackout doesn’t sound too great.

You can care about poverty and diseases AND the environment, you don't have to make it a step-by-step checklist, you can multitask.

Half of yall sound like you've never taken an economics class in your life and im about to delete this whole thread because as someone who's about to graduate with an economics degree reading your comments when you clearly don't know what you're talking about is annoying af. This is why populism is terrible and creates political instability, yall are so passionate about things you're ignorant about. There is no system that maximizes social welfare that isn't a mix of socialism and capitalism. Without regulation, capitalism becomes oligopolies and monopolies. Without regulation, firms are only concerned with profit and aren't the negative side effects to public well-being from producing their good/service is ignored and uncontrolled. If the government socializes the wrong things, it creates inefficiencies/deadweight loss/market failures. Sometimes following classic capitalistic supply and demand provides the most amount of goods for the cheapest price and everyone is well off for it. Part of being an adult is doing away with all the black-or-white thinking.	UCgDsSSB5JgsCGh0cP0J6QmQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgDsSSB5JgsCGh0cP0J6QmQ	1	UgzZBXO1yLY8wnzOf214AaABAg	Kalil E

Capitalism is the sole reason for the economic success of the US. Other countries developed other ways to maintain their economic status, but for the US, it's capitalism. Maybe capitalism is the reason the US has a homelessness problem far greater than any other first world country, but take it away now and the homeless numbers will skyrocket.

Rising costs of housing/rent. I can continue if you want, but you're trying to take a very complicated problem and make it seem like other forms of government would somehow help.

We have homelessness too, but far from the same scale. But I would say that is also from capitalism, if just partly, because believe it or not but Sweden is too capitalist. But yes, you're right there are more reasons. But this is the same as ignoring the fact that a large supply of firearms and regulations surrounding them etc are a large factor for the big gun violence in the US and just claiming there is more reasons. The thing is, the people who are arguing against that agree that it's more than just firearm access. That's the point. The US as a system needs to change in many levels for the issues to change. But to ignore one reason is just irresponsive. And if you'll try to tell me I don't know about guns and thus my beliefs are inaccurate then I'll have to disagree since I do know more than the regular person, and I do have an interest in guns.

And yes, it is because of capitalism. Capitalism is the ideology where money rules the world. It means those who have less chance to gain money will be pushed farther under than under more community friendly ideologies. There's little safety net for those close to the bottom. You follow the idea that it is up to the individual to help the homeless, not the state because that wastes money. And since believe it or not generally few people contribute little the homeless are at a massive disadvantage. And do you know common causes of homelessness? The very competitive job market where low paying jobs barely pay enough to live, the healthcare and student loans which render citizen over and over again completely broke. People die because they can't afford healthcare, daily. That is not true for Sweden which you often like to call a bad healthcare example. Yes we're lacking in doctors etc but people aren't made homeless or forced to say no to vital services and medicine. Another way you can see capitalism as the source of homelessness is drugs. There is corruption related to drugs, and a capitalist society pushes a culture where money is all that matters. Consume. consume. This means people will do everything they can. Even illegal things. Commonly drugs to reach that and so there is the massive problem of drugs. And since it is already poor people who in general are those more common to fall into the claws of narcotics it's a circle that pushes them deeper.

Dramatically going up, faster than EVER before in just the last 100 years, obviously they don’t care, they will be dead in their graves, lived a nice long life, while we’re all out here underwater and on fire.

We are not "going into an ice age every thousand years". It takes much longer. Technically we are in the Ice Age, because we still have ice caps. There are glacial and interglacial cycles though, but not every 1000 years. Last glacial period ended 135,000 years ago. Now we are in the interglacial period called Holocene which peaked about 8000 years ago. This is called Holocene Thermal Maxiumum. Now, according to glacial cycles we should slowly descend into next glacial period, but not sooner than 50,000 years from now. So the average global temperatures, if followed Milancovic Cycles and glaciation pattern, should be slowly getting colder, but we see the second peak temperatures above Thermal Maximum. AGW potentially delayed next glaciation by another 50,000 years.	UCuubbTUT1tYENB9eRLGnOng	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuubbTUT1tYENB9eRLGnOng	1	Ugyh4yxxZo82gyNcYSV4AaABAg	Piper Splindriff

Until you got to the point where you said, “Dramatically going up, faster than EVER.” This is demonstrably false. Extremely false. We are warming but not even close to faster than ever before. When we came out of the last ice age we warmed exponentially faster than the last 100 years. And that is just one of many examples that demonstrably disprove your statement. When we go on longterm macro trends of warming or cooling, we don’t go up or down in a straight line. It is common to have hundreds of years of warming in a macro cooling trend that takes 10s of thousands of years to complete.

Freshwater is not as dense as saltwater, so the floating ice cube displaced less volume than it contributed once it melted. When ice on land slides into the ocean, it displaces ocean water and causes sea level to rise.

The current effects and the effects that this will have on future generations is catastrophic. Just take a look at Greenland which used to be basically frozen, now it’s melting and that’s causing the sea level to rise which will result in many landforms completely disappearing. Most of these people except Jeremy are clueless and they only think they’re educated on this topic because they’re looking at human health and opinions about climate, not facts. The facts clearly state that we are on the verge of a mass extinction. The health of humanity is never more important than the health of the earth because if there was no earth then the human race wouldn’t have even existed.

It's agreeable that there is not yet any true factual evidence that fossil fuels are causing climate change and if you want to say this and be tied to the belief its not thats your opinion on a matter uncertain yet.

Additionally, this topic was outside the political system for a long time but scientists brought it into to raise an alarm of impending problems that could occur. You cannot just ignore the amount of evidence present. Please provide a reputable source in which it argues to why the evidence is not there and why the entire theory is "flawed". Also not really sure where you got "infallible gods" from previous comment but ok. There is evidence right in front of your face that you are ignoring. Such as animal migration pattern changes, extinction of species due to a changing climate, melting ice-caps, etc. I am just confused to why you think climate change is not real. Please tell me how the greenhouse effect theory is flawed lol. Also what exactly are your credentials, it seems like you haven't gone past middle school.

I'm not an expert, I've merely read information from both sides and looked into some of the potential solutions. I do think the best option for now is to start the shift to nuclear power, and then look into new technology that may help over the long-term. We could also consider improvements to carbon scrubbers to make them a feasible solution for larger cities (carbon scrubbers are used in many industrial businesses to help cut back on carbon emissions and toxic waste....but they're relatively limited in their capacity. But since the technology is there, it is a possible solution that could be worked up for a larger scale within a few years.) And of course, we can always plant more trees and take measures to protect the rain forests. As for the political aspects...I'm of the mind that the government tends to make problems more complicated and slows down progress....so I think that the goal should be to put this toward the private sector...set a challenge for major technology companies to find solutions. Once the government gets involved, you may as well expect that change will simply not happen. And as one of the people in the video pointed out...the science is well and good...but why is nobody getting energy experts involved in this discussion? You need to fully understand the needs of a country in regards to energy in order to find a solution...the science will only tell us what the problem is....but the real change is going to happen in a combination of technology and energy industries.

A vast majority of the scientific body agrees that humans have accelerated the pace of climate change. There is a great deal of evidence both historical and projected to prove that it is a problem and could be disastrous. By the looks of the comments you seem to only care about humans. But what about the other species that we share this planet with? Yes we are not the only ones contributing to climate change, but we are by far the major cause out of all the other species. You seem to have succumbed to cognitive dissonance, which means that you have a certain world view, and when presented with overwhelming evidence that changes/opposes your world view, you reject it. Even if you don’t think we are responsible for climate change, we can still help save the millions of species from it. You can never be to safe. Earth is our only home for our foreseeable future.

Like how AOC said there is only 12 more years to live... delusional exaggerations. Most people don't care for climate change, especially those doing low working jobs. The French yellow vests prove that, they wanted to make it harder living & make a virtual gate keeping for the working class to afford cars... so, they protested like mad. Why didn't the majority of the French, the working class at that sacrifice their cars & lives for the "environment"? Because the rich are using it as a status symbol, fear monger while putting more crazy taxes & regulations... while the rich can afford cars & many other things. The electric cars are good but the new law coming in the EU where people cannot have cars that are 10 years older will only hurt the poor. The rich can enjoy their powerful sports cars with powerful engines. Get a grip, you're deluded.

There was climate change from the Ice Age so on, that was on the verge of climate extinction. Your AP Environmental Science class sounds a waste of money if you use such terms. You can argue that humans will likely die in hundreds or thousands of years but that's a exaggeration if we exclude many factors, including scientific ones. Humans can adapt to the environment, even more so now with such much technology. We are likely to be in space in the future if a meteor or some other sort of apocalipse happens. Furthermore, the earth will likely die from the sun billions years into the future. The amount of heating up or pollutions is no big deal compared to the ICE AGE climate change & it would be amazing if we can reduce the life of earth by a billion years. You clearly have issues. You focus on one aspect, while ignoring many other things about the environment. You just focus on the climate change so much that you exaggerate it. Climate change has always existed, go look up history books & countless others. Over the years, maps, landscapes changes, some became islands, some have sunken underwater. Seriously, is your class legit? Is it a scientific one or is just part of the gender studies where you do swj "environment" virtue signalling training?

So in this case if you are unsure of the true outcome wouldn't the safe option be to just change anyway? There is factual evidence that fossil fuel emissions cause harm. Maybe not specifically to climate change, but smog and acid rain surely do exist and are cause by emissions of fossil fuels. If they are causing other issues and COULD possibly be causing climate change as well, it seems overall better to no longer use them. Just fruit for thought	UCwASXG2pTb9Io-03bScpT5g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwASXG2pTb9Io-03bScpT5g	1	UgyEo8D_N8-TZYi3a6N4AaABAg	Aria Mcelroy

What about the forty years of catastrophic predictions that have failed to come true? 100% failure rate. I remember Leonard Nimoy warning us of the coming ice age. What happened to that? I could list 40 more but if your memory is poor there’s no point.

UgzxX30VhecjUKR1Gth4AaABAg	2	1	2020-03-05 23:38:43	Adam Donahue	Personally, I believe climate change is happening and is overwhelmingly attributable to man. I really think that the facts are there and that disagreeing with 97% of the world’s scientists is questionable. However, while I like to have my own views confirmed and reinforced by others (at the expense of the other point of views), I do not feel comfortable with this comments section. I know it’s a comments section on YouTube, but isn’t Jubilee essentially about seriously listening to other people’s views when they speak civilly and reasonably. Even if those views are contrary to yours, you should still hear them out as long as they speak reasonably. Granted, there is a point where I can’t really help myself from rushing to judgment (that guy in the Trump Supporters mole video who watches InfoWars), but I think we ought to be more kind to those people who put themselves out there for the world to judge. I remain very confident in my views, but I’d like to see some more diverse and open-minded dialogue from the followers of this channel.

They’re respectful and they don’t interrupt or try to dominate the discussion. They definitely do ignore or discount facts that they should be considering, but the problem is that they think they’re right (obviously). When you think you’re right, odds are that you’ll subconsciously select information that suggests your point of view. That’s human. I think we should be able to forgive that and not call people idiots if they fall prey to that effect as well. Throwing insults does no good, it only contributes to the divide between people. (Going off on a somewhat unrelated tangent now) In order to be truly convincing, we need to try to actually convince the person we’re discussing with. “Winning” the argument shouldn’t be the goal in political discourse; it should be respectfully trying to make the other side see your viewpoints as you see them. That’s how we should approach discussion: politely and open-mindedly (to a certain point) listening and arguing.

The consequence of the sea level rise if the ice-sheets melt on human life and other life, ect. Humanity trusts that it will always be able to fix any problem that gets thrown at it because of the rise of modern technology. The guy with the glasses needs to understand that humans have ultimately nature to thank for our abundance of wealth, and that includes the exploitation of fossil fuels. If we ruin the Earth&#39;s climate system(s), there are many, then we will not have enough of the wealth to share with a growing population. <br /><br /><br />PS: Please can you do a middle ground to see whether climate scientists think the same (not climate extremists) since there is a difference.

The video is well-produced and it&#39;s an interesting video where we get to hear more about climate change skeptics, which we frankly don&#39;t hear a lot from in the mainstream media! <br />It&#39;s refreshing and new, although I would also argue - like the far majority of people in the comments - that their opinions don&#39;t seem to be very based on facts and they don&#39;t seem very educated on the matter, but I belive Jubilee did a great job with the video and I&#39;m glad it&#39;s here.<br />Big thumbs up from me!

They take 25 plastic bags while buying grocerys but never think about where it goes after they used it. Most of them never leave their country seeing countries where those effects hit hard.

Humans, particularly from rich democratic countries, will probably survive and be fine with climate change, because we are very adaptable. But we will destroy everything. So many species and ecosystems. Our food will be at huge risk (which I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll find ways around). But it&#39;s inhumane to subject the people from poorer countries who often rely on predictable climate to live.

It&#39;s good for people who are stereotyped by their identity into having similar opinions and it allows people to express their different ones. But it doesn&#39;t work when you have people who all have the same OPINION and are not related otherwise. To me, this was the worst spectrum of all time because it&#39;s the only one to have people with the same opinion and then makes it really useless to compare their opinions.

We were going through kind of a drought but recently we’ve had standing water where there hasn’t been water in over 50 years. Haven’t broken many heat records, wind records, or precipitation records but we have broken several cold records and temperature over the course of a month at a whopping -.2*f. Yesterday we broke a heat record last set in 1968 and matched again in 1986 by 1*f.

Combine CO2 released from humane activity, with gaz released from nature because of human activity, with deforestation which as a massive impact on biodiversity and carbon cycle, with the pollution of oceans and the impact of death zones and plankton populations, and then you have a great cocktail that overall has an impact on climate change. The numbers of tree are going drastically down while the number of greenhouse gasses related to human activity released every year is only going up. If we trust scientists and scientific consensus, this isn’t good. And like I said, it doesn’t take more than a .3 change et ocean temperatures to cause massive damage.

Do you know why the earth went threw so many eras? It’s because the temperature and gaz concentration in the atmosphere is always changing, but accelerating it by exponentially literally over releasing CO2 and methane,which is supposed to stay under the ice caps, os detrimental to the planet’s health. People don’t seem to understand that lets say the ocean gets only 1 degree hotter than it is supposed to be, it could have a massive impact of the biosphere. In reality, 1 degree would be too much, only like a .3 raise could do massive damage.

And yes in winter they freeze again, but less re-freeze more and more each year. Now if you are telling me that a thicker atmosphere doesn&#39;t heat the planet. Then look at our solar system Mercury is closer to the sun then Venus, yet Venus is hotter. This is because Venus has a thicker atmosphere.<br />Now as for how climate change effects us. Well starting with the UK due to a massive chunk of iceberg breaking off it stop the gulf stream from working properly this is because fresh water (which is what icebergs consist off) is denser and pulls the current down. This then lead to us having the Beast from the East and then later that year a very intense heat wave (for us brits). This is because we then got winds from the East therefore got more extreme weather like them. Extreme weather is one of the main problems with climate change because it basically means more: frequent, dangerous, and unpredictable weather. The weather that I am talking about is: tornadoes, hurricanes, droughts which leads to wildfires, flooding. Flooding is caused by the ice caps melting and the fact that when the ocean is heated it expands. If you think these weather events are in some other third world country they are everywhere.<br /><br />I am not exaggerating I am just telling the truth.<br />Thank you for listening to my ted talk.

This is a serious problem no matter what side of the debate you are on because at that point, it&#39;s not even a debate. There is plenty of evidence showing that humans have no effect on climate change but we still base everything on simulations that have been changed by humans to get the worst effect. Funny thing is, the only simulation that has been the closest over the last few decades is the one showing that humans have no effect, and that&#39;s really all the evidence you need to prove we have little-to no effect on the climate. All other simulations predicting climate change have been astronomically higher than what the world is actually experiencing, and those are the sims that scientists put in numbers and predicted changes from humans.

The ocean is already used for hydroelectricity which is another source of renewable energy. Renewable energy doesn't just consist of wind and solar power. It has so much more like thermal energy, hydropower, nuclear energy and biomass.

We should consider the fact that if we were going to build a nuclear power plant it should not be near any tectonic plates since they cause earthquakes and other natural disasters so i think only a few countries can truly have an effective nuclear power plant. I think they should resource to other renewable energies.	UCYgxiYtEQY6WF3P6BiEQfDg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYgxiYtEQY6WF3P6BiEQfDg	1	Ugxd-mC5YBjVVXdediN4AaABAg	vulcanhumor

You guys are great but should have had someone or half the people on the other end of the spectrum this would have made for better conversation. There are definitely fossil fuel alternatives. The best example is nuk energy which is more capable of sustaining our needs and can provide much more power for things such as electric cars which we WILL eventually need if we want to stop going to war for oil. Someone should have brought up rising sea level, this is an evident threat to humanity which is directly tied into their human over nature interest. Antarctica just has the hottest january in 114 years peaking at 66F for the january avg was previously -14 for this time of year. If would have liked to see them confront these issues.

One in the 90's, the other up until 2016 when he got The Clap. So much of their research came out with boring results which supported climate change skepticism. However, the organizations (and researchers) were being paid brain surgeon bucks to publish data and studies which supported the Green Party. Suffice to say, they're both what you'd call "skeptics."

In a world where we need to have discussions and open talk, people shouldn't shut down other people they disagree with. I hate that about most of the liberal people. Chanting you down, instead of being open to discussion. Yeah, there's probably bad examples on either side and good ones on either side. That's why i said that i hate it about MOST of those people, because obviously not everyone is the same. I can disagree with you on the most adverse of topics, but i will listen to you anyway. I don't believe in God, I'm an Atheist, but if you wanna tell me about the bible i won't shut you down and declare all of what you said as nonsense, just because i don't agree. I'll let you believe in whatever you think is right and what you want to believe in and in exchange i just expect the same kind of respect from you. Just respect on the most basic level.

But I would see it like that: Jeremy was trying to understand the other side and also wasn't totally obsessed with his own opinions on the matter but tried to think from multiple standpoints and perspectives in order to form his own opinion on the topic. I believe that a person is not "well informed" just because they read a book written by a person with a similar opinion than theirs. That way they don't get all the information and might miss some facts or just get even more bias But that's just my opinion :)	UCZ7j7VKtHf-Tgjw9HVX3_vg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ7j7VKtHf-Tgjw9HVX3_vg	1	UgwEjCVxebyyqmPGJF14AaABAg	Monica

Keith's entire viewpoint is based around his interpretation of the Bible and Constitution, while the humanists believe we basically shouldn't give up something(ie. fossil fuels) if its a detriment to human growth, not even realizing there's a limit to fossil fuel usage or that the alternatives aren't necessarily detrimental.

Sure, it is freedom of expression, but think of how many more individuals (from an already existing, and apparently growing-base) will continue to be &#39;skeptical&#39; about climate-change; the more attention we give them, the more that we will prolong the issue. <br /><br />The reality is, they were asked about CLIMATE CHANGE yet had no coherent answers. They are stuck in their obsessive take on mainstream-media, the &#39;left&#39;, millionaires, the Constitution, and so on. Their answer is too political, and not fundamentally based on science. They are mixing up the issues. Comments like: &quot;If Polar Bears go extinct, well, there&#39;d be other bears&quot;, or &quot;I am well informed about the subject because I have been to some conferences, and read a book&quot; really say everything you need to know about these people. <br /><br />The climate is forever changing, true. But what the VAST MAJORITY of scientists and experts (actually educated people who have studied for decades, hold degrees from big universities, and research scientific data and theories all their life) are claiming, is that human-beings are exacerbating the issue to the point that we will have to deal with huge issues like the mass extinction of animals, unhealthy water, toxic/less clean air, and a dangerous INCREASE in temperatures (yes, Mr. Donald Trump, that means an increase in BOTH COLD and HOT weather; winters get worse, summers get worse, and the seasons become less consistent).

"First and foremost, do you really think this so-called switch will be practically possible in the modern world, considering the amount of energy consumption targets being met in the industrial sector alone. I think this scenario is extremely hypothetical with no validity. Secondly, use of renewable energy will not lead to any decrease in carbon dioxide emission rates." -University Professor from Bristol about switching from fossil fuels to renewable Energy. A lot of it is about energy consumption targets being met, switching from fossil fuels to renewable energy. You can't just hit a switch and everything is green and good. It has to be changed slowly over a lot of years and can't be done just by snapping your fingers.

I agree with you, I guess the point I was trying to make (im not the best writer hhh) was that I just think a lot of wealthy countries rely too much on oil and gas production & keeps producing it because they make so much money from it, and the sooner more wealthy countries decides to try more sustainable energy the better it will be in the end? Or at least people will have more options & it’ll be easier to keep evolving the technology to make it even better in the future so countries are able to use multiple resources but be able to use less and less fossil fuels / gasses.

Because in the end the resources needed to make batteries for cars and other storage items for reusable electricity will also be gone someday so we have to use a variety of things and not exploit just one thing.

Don’t get me wrong, I hate the fact that this is happening, but I do have to point out that the science of natural selection entails extinction if an animal can not adapt fast enough. This includes influences such as environmental changes, but also predatory changes. In this case, the speed at which the ice caps are melting at may be unnatural, but the ways it has effected other animals is still within the science of natural selection. Again, that being said, humans have the capability to interfere with natural selection, and in this case, I believe we should.

Yes, the Bering Sea freezes in the winter and thaws in the summer, that's not a polar ice cap. The polar ice cap took a very long time to create (and doesn't thaw in the summer) and is taking very little time to melt.

I've also never met a "climate alarmist," as you call them, who is anti-nuclear because of the climate.

It is anti human because climate alarmists want to get rid of all the cheap energy like coal, gas, oil, and even nuclear. This will result in poor people around the world, not being able to afford to heat their homes or keep their food cold or whatever they use energy for.

The major argument formed by the parents to explain their opinion was their distrusted of the government and thinking that our governments today do not have ONLY our health in mind.<br />When I listen to the people of this Spectrum episode, and hear them saying &quot;I am well informed, yet I do not believe in global warming&quot; while all the major official and governmental institutions are in agreement that yes, global warming is real and should be addresses, all I can see is that it is their way to show that they would rather believe a non official form of information rather than our governments, and that our governments have broken our trust in them on multiple levels.<br />Then what follow is, what should our governments put in place so we believe them again, we trust them again, and we move together again, in the best direction that can be for us?

Because they&#39;re assuming that it is, maybe fossil fuels will still be in use for the remainder of their lives but eventually it&#39;s going to run out and then we&#39;ll have to start using other renewable sources of energy. It&#39;s just funny that skeptics often don&#39;t think fossil fuels cause global warming, believe that fossil fuels are the best thing ever and think that it can last forever or at least for a long time, yet they call younger generations or non skeptics naive. Maybe they&#39;re the hypocritical ones, which then makes them hypocritical for calling other people hypocritical... or something like that	UCZ9QFFKS6NB5yrKIkGs1iMg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ9QFFKS6NB5yrKIkGs1iMg	0

Sure, mutant animals won't spawn out of those materials, but it still emits radiation on a high scale and is extremely cancerous. One small leak is all it would take for there to be a miniature Hiroshima-Nagasaki-like event again, or you know something similar. Either way, it's gonna be nad, it may be a fuel that can quickly regenerate itself, but it is still a non-renewable fuel.

I know that but my problem is that they're acting like they'll never run out, and it will be very long until then. Maybe they'll forever live in a world ran on fossil fuels but for many others (i.e. younger generations) it won't be like that. The population is increasing and the demand for energy is increasing, they will be significantly diminished in 50 years and some of the people aren't giving renewable sources of energy a chance. Eventually we will have to use other sources, such as nuclear, wind, solar and maybe newfound sources. It's just that fossil fuels can't sustain us for very long and they pose other dangers such as global warming. And it's not that I'm not grateful for fossil fuel because I am, it's allowed for technological advancements that I can't live without in my day to day life and I'm sure it's the same for you. But it won't be like that forever is what I'm trying to say, the future need to be considered as well as the present.

A lot of things you are using are made using fossil fuels. Yes, they will run out but that would be a very long time and that time might be a time where we already created an energy source that could replace fossil fuel such as nuclear (that isnt dangerous).

Ugy6D-IpnQyrpxkWM3B4AaABAg	0	0	2020-03-05 16:47:55	nxstellar	Please consider my counter arguments:<br /><br /><br />If Keith agrees with the bible and everything that it says, shouldn&#39;t he also care about other living beings like i don&#39;t know POLAR BEARS? You can&#39;t justify the death of a whole species by saying there are other similar species. Honey no. Not only is this an ethical issue but also makes sense logically. Polar bears are part of the ecosystem and their extinction may disrupt the food chain which ultimately affects humanity. Here&#39;s a fact, climate change activists are trying to care for the environment so that humans do not get endangered in the coming future, the earth itself will live until it gets swallowed by the sun, we are not trying to save the earth and be non-humanists. By saving the environment including living beings in it, we are saving ourselves. Please reconsider.<br /><br /><br />Hi Alex, yes humanity does need fossil fuels and fossil fuels have contributed a lot to the development of the human race. I&#39;m sure we&#39;d love to have more of it but we don&#39;t. If you do not believe that fossil fuels are that big of a deal and that they don&#39;t contribute much to global warming, then consider this: Fossil fuels are running out. So whatever it is you believe, we eventually need to switch to a sustainable energy resource. In addition, we already have some working alternatives. They just require a considerable amount of investment which more economically developed countries can provide. <br /><br /><br />Yes, it may feel as though climate change is not affecting you, but it is affecting ecosystems in forests (forest fires etc) and oceans such as corals (coral bleaching in australia). It helps us as a species to save other species in different ecosystems. For e.g. fish live in corals and without corals, people whose diet contains fish will have less food.

So looks like you are voting for Trump then, right? Sanders and Gabbard want to ban fracking. Fracking emits half the CO2 emissions as coal. Fracking is the main reason why our CO2 emissions have dropped while other developed nations has increased their emissions. All renewables combined make up a total of 11% of the energy market and solar and wind are a fraction of that. I work in solar and know Solar and wind are unreliable energy. We can use them but they aren’t going to power the world. Solar panels can’t power a hospital. Look up the actual data.

There is nothing wrong with worrying about economic growth and there is nothing wrong with caring about climate change... You are capable of caring about climate change and also care about economic growth. I&#39;m not a capitalist (However I do believe in socialism, not because I hate capitalism but because I believe that too much capitalism is bad thing and that every country should have a balance between capitalism and communism in order to fix a lot of issues that seem to never get fixed because of too much capitalism, otherwise I don&#39;t see anything wrong with being financially independant and working hard or smart for what you want and getting the rewards that you deserve for it, but just because you or your great great great great grandmother worked hard does not mean that everybody else should have their rights being infrindged upon), but I think that just because a number of industries are going to die because of climate change activists does not mean that the economy is doomed forever and ever... It just means that, if whoever was thriving in that industry lost their jobs or their careers and all of their millions of dollars, because time did what time does best, they were not smart enough or quick enough to evolve with their market before it was too late. That&#39;s how capitalism works. You do what you need to do to keep your business alive. If your customers are changing their lifestyles or they start expecting you to provide them with something that is not only better in quality but cheaper and you fail to do that, that is not on climate change, or politicians or SJWs or millenials or gen zs, that&#39;s on you as a business person. If you cannot change with the times, you&#39;ll be left behind with no money or jobs or &quot;legacy&quot;. Welcome to The World of Business and Economics.

Like you said, only hearing problems by useless attention-seeking media figures and politicians, but no solutions, because they are ideological deluded and there science goes as deep as the first two sentences of the wikipedia article.

And more importantly what would we even do about it? I rarely hear solutions from people, just problems. They don't even tell me what I'm doing wrong, just that I'm doing something terribly wrong. If it is a result of human impact over hundreds of years it's doubtful we would be able to do much to change that in a short amount of time. I appreciate you bringing up that perspective from outside the US. And it makes sense. I just have a hard time seeing how A is connected to B necessarily. It's a large complex problem and I think it's easy to try to pin solutions to certain things when it might be a variety of real factors at play. I don't think a complex problem can be addressed so simply. It's easy to point to something and say look, that's the problem right there, that's what's causing all this. How things are connected, what influence they have and what to do about it, that's where my skepticism comes in.

I don't know if you really want to talk about it but I'll ask anyway. So from what I understand you do love your planet. Nut now honestly, I don't know about the US but does it not feel like the climate is getting hotter? because in a lot of other countries it is happening, hotter weather and less rain. these are facts that cannot be denied. Consequences: species are going extinct, plants are dying, people are having a hard time finding water in desertic areas, more and more drought are happening in my countries and neighboring countries, which did not happen with the previous generations. Are you skeptical that the climate is changing or that humans have an impact on climate change?

I've never said I'm against any of those things you mentioned. I'm all for cleaner air and helping the environment. I really am. People think that if im a skeptic I'm suddenly against anything that will help the planet. It's not the case at all. Those are great things.

You understand that this can impact next generations in a bad way and can admit that there are bad consequences that we can change. Climate change activists are not asking for humans to live in tents, neither for complete replacement of fossil fuels, we all know that fossil fuels are not clean and pollute the air, using hybrid or electrical cars instead is enough to reduce pollution.

There's a lack of trust between scientists and general public that goes both ways: scientists are no longer trusting the public to listen and act, and the general public no longer trusts scientist expertise. The ability to SLOW the damage is atleast well supported, which buys us time to innovate long term solutions, before it is too late. There's still value in slowing changes, or trying to stop them, which is backed by science.

It kind of seems hypocritical that you believe natural production of similar gasses impacts the climate but not human production of gases. Yes, there are different gases , but also similar gases that are found between human emissions and volcano eruptions. I’m not an expert in climate change, but it’s crazy how just a 2C difference in water can change the diversity and specie richness of an ecosystem. And because of this change, it could cause horrible disasters for humans. For example, coral is an extremely important part of ecosystems that helps reduce damages caused by large waves and because of an increase in water temperatures, coral species are killed off. It’s really annoying how people who are “skeptics” don’t observe these environmental changes that can be detrimental for other people.

I don't think even the so-called "deniers" are denying the changing temperatures. They're skeptical of human influence on those changes, or how much humans can change the current trajectory. If you're studying science, then you should also be looking into the history as well. The earth has had many periods of warming followed by cooling through history. There was an unexplained "mini Ice Age" in the 15th or 16th century, for example, and there are many factors that influence changing climate conditions. Volcanic eruptions, for instance, would have a significant impact on the climate by putting out significant emissions of different gases, as well as the inevitable clouds that partially block the sun...a few large eruptions have caused global cooling in history.

And general consensus isnt an argument either, because not every scientist has studied this deeply, especially when it comes to direct causation of CO2 on climate, which is the most important issue. Im old enough to remember Al gore who was putting out all kinds of misinformation, lies, fearmongering. None of his predictions came true. Polar bear populations are exploding. Antarctic ice is growing. Cities arent underwater. Sea rising by 1 inch every 10 years since mareographs in the 19th century started measuring and decelerated recently...Now we have socialists that fearmonger, because they want to control every part of the economy and our life...

If you're NOT looking at the counter arguments you're only CONFIRMING YOUR BIASES -- this is 100% undisputed TRUTH of what you are doing. I cannot stress this enough. Spend at least 5 hours watching experts on both sides of the fence debate each other and then get back to me. . Despite what the main stream media and reading "headlines" may be telling you (which is probably where your "research" stops), there IS NOT A CONSENSUS on global warming. If you REALLY REALLY take the time to watch experts from both sides duke it out, you should, at a minimum, be extremely confused at the end of the debate and questioning your former beliefs. Trust me -- man kind does NOT have all the answers, to global warming, or otherwise. And thinking that we do is extremely arrogant.

Within us an ever growing need to survive and thrive; our self-preservation. To achieve this we must work as a group; therefore, every human matter to us. Animals also want to survive, yet the question is not whose creatures have self preservation, but whose creatures bested each others desire to live. This is why our lives have more value than an animal, because we collectively decide our own importance trump others. 3 seems my comments are bug.

(btw before anyone assumes, I'm pro-ecofriendly and green BUT) Why would people care about nature nowadays? I have never seen a bear before in the wild (because I don't live in a climate that have them naturally) so why should I care about them at all? We're taught all wild animals are dangerous, spreading disease, attacking people, and generally being pests on property. Like, no duh people no longer care about preserving the environment when it's depicted as a hideous unkempt mass of dangers. Those who wanted to live closer to nature are laughed at by society for being hippies and unreasonable. I think personally the best thing to happen is for there to be a catastrophe that would be so destructive to humanity that we will be forced into giving up our hedonistic unsustainable world-views caused by globalization and profiteering since people won't do it willingly right now.

Disaster	&quot;If Fossil fuels remain free to use for future generations then... blah blah blah&quot;<br /><br />Fossil fuels aren&#39;t an infinite resource, it&#39;s limited, and a good portion of the Middle Eastern conflict (or at least America&#39;s particular very vested interest in it) can be essentially simplified to oil and its newfound scarcity.<br />We don&#39;t have the privilege of looking at this limited resource as infinite anymore, even without considering the effect it has on the climate, we need to look at permanent solutions, and the primary reason why people like this think that Green energy isn&#39;t a powerful enough substitute is because the tech hasn&#39;t been improved to the point where it is powerful enough. More efficient Solar Panels, more efficient Hydro plants, there are so many sources of Green energy that can be improved drastically. We&#39;ve even put wind farms in the ocean, imagine if we could get solar panels there, they could maybe even follow the sun to an extent to extend the amount of sunlight they receive, I don&#39;t know it&#39;s future tech. 100 years ago we couldn&#39;t imagine flying on a commercial scale, now nearly 40 thousand flights take place every day, transporting nearly 2.7 million passengers. The technology can be developed and all we need to do is fund the research since this is a relatively new source of power when compared to fossil fuels like coal and oil, it&#39;s been around less than a century.<br /><br /><br />The climate on Earth is changing, it is now so much different to any climate that we&#39;ve had in the past, the summer is more brutal and droughts are more common, leading to more fires. The air temperature is varying wildly leading to more tornadoes and hurricanes, etc. Notably powerful storms are more common and the polar ice caps are nearly gone after a period of a few decades of observation. It&#39;s very difficult for me to imagine the climate as these people seem to as a disconnected system from Earth, when we&#39;re clearly seeing the effects of it. 1 degree (Celsius for you Americans) difference can change an entire eco-cycle, sea temperatures are rising and that&#39;s having an effect on fish, who are swimming deeper to waters they can survive in, which makes fishing harder, the fish are more subject to dangerous predators and even coral, which can&#39;t really move, they can only survive in narrow temperatures. Look at the Great Barrier Reef, it&#39;s bleaching faster than we can catalogue it.<br /><br /><br />Is it just a coincidence that the Earth started turning hostile to various forms of organic life suddenly when we started using fossil fuels on a global scale? Or does it go through Mass Extinction events hundreds of millions of years apart and then occasionally throw in one in between regularly scheduled programs just to fuck with the data?

If you have a particularly sunny stretch of months and you over-collect enough energy, you can store it for the less sunny months. Nuclear is a good option only if we can properly manage fusion; fission power is also unsustainable long-term. It's being worked on, though.

The reason for this is that wind and solar, yes, have an energy storage issue, but also a rentability and reliability issue. Pick any one spot on Earth, that spot will either not be a reliable enough source of energy, or not be big enough to support a city. For solar you don't just need daylight, you need direct exposure to the Sun ; if the weather is cloudy, we're screwed. If it'll generate energy, it won't be nearly as much as when it's a sunny day. Wind is similarly unreliable, and cannot support our consuption. We would need a huge landmass, *and* not people who don't want wind turbines "in their backyard". Wind would probably start to be reliable if the landmass became a watermass, but then that's hella expensive to install. Currently the one energy source that surpasses fossil fuels in all aspects of the issue at the same time, is nuclear. The rest will be less profitable, less reliable, or/and won't be able to support our consumption, besides the problem of energy storage, which is a real problem. I'll agree with you and the Trump part of your comment though, but isn't Trump a climate change skeptic too ? I mean… it makes sense that they would support him. To conclude, I would say that we need to, individually, understand that infinitely increasing growth over time will not happen. It's not just that it's a bad idea or anything like that, it's that it's impossible, mathematically and physically impossible. We can only transform what is here and free. We need to understand that our population continually increasing is not durable, and there will be a moment where this will need to be balanced out by something else. Either reason on our part, or forced external conditions, like natural disasters, diseases, viruses, etc.	UCGchvVgBxI3R0Ce7YciZ3JA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGchvVgBxI3R0Ce7YciZ3JA	1	UgxhEq62BWd7iLIezHZ4AaABAg	Pride A.

Ice caps melting can cause the sea levels to rise, which will cause flooding. The temperature of the sea can change if enough ice melts, which will cause effects that we’re not sure about. When ice caps melt, they also can release methane gas that has been trapped in them. Methane gas is one of the greenhouse gases that traps in some of the suns rays which heats up the earth. I might be wrong about this, but I believe we do need to change now, not later.	UCvYqgXE9EZ8jKVZ5OVo2bag	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvYqgXE9EZ8jKVZ5OVo2bag	0

Even these people in the video would admit, that we will run out of the group 1, 2 and 3 base crude oils one day (assuming they even know what those are...) This is why we have created other fossil fuel variants such as Biofuels (E85, Biodiesel etc), and Natural Gas Variants (LPG/LNG/CNG, oils derived from NG gas etc.) They burn cleaner and are more abundant then you think.

Sometimes I forget how naïve our society is. People don’t understand that we need to protect our ecosystems to survive. If we destroy our ecosystems, we lose all of its resources. There is no way to manufacture earths natural ecosystem services. And to the man who said “there are many bears...” you truly are a small thinker. If you lose a species, in any ecosystem, that very well can lead to a collapse (especially a keystone species like a polar bear) how is the youth supposed to stay hopeful when past generations work against our progression.

However, the impact we have on the environment is definitely not entirely necessary, in absolute? sure but in terms of quantity you cannot deny that we use a whole lot more than we actually need. Whether it's energy consumption, single use plastic or imported products etc. I think it is fair to ask the general public to care about their impact on the environment especially when it is undeniably reducible. there are so many ways to reduce your impact on the environment that are so very manageable and do not affect your quality of life. ''why should we?'' if you don't want to do it for other species maybe do it for the human race. the human population keeps growing and most resources or not infinite (not the ones we use today). Logically you encounter a dead end at some point if you don't change parts of the equation (like our consumption or the resources we rely on). (no worries for the long msg, i think it makes a healthy debate)	UCQvTHMb91Qe4JQczD6yqRUg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQvTHMb91Qe4JQczD6yqRUg	1	UgyNSiQ_IzaaXczUKkl4AaABAg	Talon M
UgyNSiQ_IzaaXczUKkl4AaABAg.95pKEvuaxZw95rjTagZw0e		1	2020-03-06 13:39:54	Jason Kurth	tae tae yeah so I agree that ideally we would not be damaging the environment at all. the difference between wars and damaging the environment is that most wars are bad for humans as a whole with pretty much no upside but each time we “damage” the environment it’s to gain something (resources, space etc). Often it’s better for humans (and I’m talking about just humans) to slightly damage the environment to gain valuable resources. After all that how we are able to create products that we use. Assuming we want the best for humans, we will keep on doing this even if it means some species, like polar bears will go extinct. The only time we would stop hurting the environment is when the cost of hurting it is more than the value of the commodity Isa very hard line to define.

That doesn't sound like something someone would say if they were for slavery.	UC9kCv5APNimGrh6wvPLho1w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9kCv5APNimGrh6wvPLho1w	1	UgxkCp3dpBUdgwtTPVN4AaABAg	Malin M

Many fought and died through the two and a half centuries of our nationality to expand those rights to everyone. The original constitution was 100% for the RICH, WHITE, MEN, of its time. It took blood tears and sweat to get amendments like the abolition of slavery and voting rights for black people and woman to name few. The only ignorant one here is u.

But these people aren’t talking about mankind as a whole. Probably none of the people there will ever be heavily effected by climate change (since they’re a older generation), but people in poorer countries will. Western society is so focused on itself that it doesn’t even dare to think that there are people like us in the rest of the world that will be extremely effected by all of this. Yes water is 70% of the earth and if the ice doesn’t stop melting at this alarming rate, people (yes, humans, the ones that you care so much about) are going to suffer.

Because it is so complex. BUT trying to pursue the interest of a single area just because you work with it isn&#39;t being right, it&#39;s being stubborn. Efficient choices are made when all the people invoved come to a solution that&#39;s it&#39;s the best of all worlds involved. It doesn&#39;t stand by one side only. Things aren&#39;t black or white.

Because you get everyday news by media (being it on the internet, on a newspapper, etc.). People shouldn&#39;t blindly accept everything they read but they should be critical enough to search for the truth. And talking about science that&#39;s pretty easy. You have access to a lot of arcticles about every possible topic. You can see how relevant they ar, how recent they are, etc. You have access to scientific organiztion&#39;s data online, a click away.

Most Ldc&#39;s are heavily polluted due to fossil fuel. Renewables can create energy from basic things like wind and light but fossil fuels are limited and onces they are used they have to dig up more of the earth in another place to find more. It&#39;s ridiculous that someone couldn&#39;t understand that basic idea. If theres not enough space for wind and solar energy then why is there enough land to destroyed for fossil fuel?

Being a biologist who is thinking of pursuing the area of ecology and maybe broaden my knowledge on the topic, I consider myself more educated on the topic than most people (who are obviously not on the same area). It&#39;s crazy to me that people think the impacts of climate change aren&#39;t a problem. I&#39;m not even talking about if it&#39;s natural or if it isn&#39;t, it&#39;s for sure proven to be a problem (and a big one). We are already seeing the consequences and people really do turn a blind eye to that.	UC6VUAwziPMD3-ZdBOR2dmzw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6VUAwziPMD3-ZdBOR2dmzw	0

The mere fact that we are scrapping for the last remaining morsels of fossils fuels through the extremes of blasting high-pressure chemicals deep under ground in the name of &quot;fracking&quot; tells anyone with a brain that Fossil fuels are (and this is well known regardless) NON-RENEWABLE.

Bees, for instance, are falling in numbers to the point where farmers HAVE TO TRAVEL across the country with hives in trucks to plantations just to facilitate pollination. This is NOT NORMAL. And this is simply because of monoculture, which has SEVERELY diminished the plant diversity that bees NEED &amp; thrive on. And this is just one example of very many.

Their answer to the prompt showed a lot of arrogance, and so I lost trust in their opinions.	UCdUeMJw-BXU3ppiBFk0TIdw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdUeMJw-BXU3ppiBFk0TIdw	0

Covid-19 for example, is most definitely being sensationalized by the media. That doesn’t change the fact that is something we should be very worried about— from an epidemiological, individual, and financial standpoint. It’s got a relatively low lethality rate, but such a high infectivity that many epidemiologists estimate majority populations of the US contracting it before we reach a preventative solution. Most of us won’t die, but the elderly, the immune compromised, the poor— they have a reason to be sacred (that’s an oversimplification of it; really all of us should be scared to an extent). And in the context of climate change, people like to side with the ideology of downplaying global disaster. The issue is that the most scientifically consistent ideologies in both these cases are extreme. It does not make them any less true.

But the motivation behind it is to extend our global stability and help the people that are suffering now, while holding out a sliver of hope that we’ll reach some kind of miracle solution. It’s like if you were told you had a fatal disease and only a few years to live: it’s probably understandable to throw your hands up and spend the rest of your life eating junk food and enjoying yourself, but most people wouldn’t consider that a palatable or reasonable response. You’d probably want to try experimental treatments, keep yourself as healthy as possible, and hold out an (illogical) hope for recovery. That’s essentially climate activism. For the record, I’m not suggesting that either you or I is responsible for this and should feel guilty. Individualist climate action (like the plastic straw boycotting stuff) is little more than wishful thinking. It’s a way for people to feel like they’re making change, and a way for the major corporate players in this crisis to deflect blame and appear ‘woke’. The only hope we have for effective climate reform is through political means— and politicians don’t do something expensive if half their constituents are uninformed or disbelieving. All I really ask is awareness, anger, and the small dedication to educating yourself and others when you can.

It's more accurate to say that skeptics want to know how much is influenced by human behavior (it's not entirely the fault of humans...a single volcanic eruption puts out more CO2 than humans can in ten years, for example), how much is inevitable due to the fact that the planet has been warming since the ice age, and what options can help at the present time. It's rare that someone actively denies the climate is warming...rather, they may deny that it's warming at a catastrophic rate, or that we have the technology to resolve the issues. Reality is that we simply don't have the technology, at this time, to completely reach net-zero emissions. We can get close with nuclear power, but a lot of climate change activists refuse to consider nuclear as a solution. Don't know why.

If you look at the history of the planet, then you'd notice that temperature changes are influenced by a lot of factors. Large volcanic eruptions, for example, are often followed by periods of cooling temperatures. The real question is how much of the changing temperatures are due to human activities, CO2 emissions from humans, and preventable problems. I don't think most supposed "skeptics" of climate change are denying the problems...rather, they're trying to look into realistic solutions and realistic timelines for such solutions. It's somewhat annoying to be called a "denier" simply because I don't think being an alarmist is helpful.

But the effects, the reasons, the importance, I am skeptical. I'm not denying some of the evidence they've found. I'm not necessarily on board w their predictions of the future. Scientists don't always make accurate predictions of the future. Climatologists don't accurately predict the weather more than a week out. Doctors predict certain outcomes of patients inacurately regularly. People, including experts don't make good prophets or fortune tellers. And they claim to know what will happen to the earth in ten plus years? That's why I'm skeptical. I don't straight out deny it. I think it's healthy to push back, be realistic, and wait a reasonable amount of time to make accurate predictions before jumping to conclusions.

However, I think, that to create a solution, any solution, the first step is to point out the problem and get everyone on board that there actually is a problem so that it can be fixed in a community effort. One person alone isn't gonna do much. So with climate change solutions won't get us anywhere if people aren't even willing to believe that there is a problem. And my second point is that there are things that every individual can and IMO should do, like not consuming more then they need, or not putting everything in plastic bags when there a so many easy alternatives, but all this individual effort won't be enough if big industries don't also make an effort to be more eco-friendly. Basically, I think that there are in fact action we can take, we (including companies here) just aren't willing to.

If people started voting for politicians who value research for solutions to global warming, then maybe we would actually get a solution. Denying it and not thinking about it does nothing. Supporting people who are trying to find the solution for it does a whole lot more than nothing.

Pointing out a problem with zero solutions is so worthless. In any situation. People telling me I'm doing something terribly wrong and yet I can't do anything to fix it because it's so globally massive? That's my entire beef with it. If the earth and humanity is plummeting toward imminent destruction then what are we so worried about? If there's no solution then there's no solution. We should buckle up and enjoy the ride. And also, the likelihood of that actually being the case seems extremely unlikely. To give a small example, in a way it's like the Corona virus. It's real. A few people have been hurt by it. But the world is freaking out about it and acting like we're doomed. When in reality the vast majority of the world will not be effected by it one bit and it will probably be gone and forgotten in a few months. For every little thing that happens people blow it out of proportion in order to try to be safe. If the world is in fact that doomed from climate change, there's no way any one of us will be able to change that course. And if there is in fact action we can take, I would gladly do it. I don't think there are horrible negligible things I'm guilty of doing like people act like I am. No on has even told me what I can do about it then. So why are they so upset. Tell me what I can even do. That's my point. I understand your point but actionable solutions seem so out of reach. Not only out of reach but non existent. People just like to jump on board the latest hippest train of catrastophe.	UC-qm4QheOlmMvIR3LTE-mmg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-qm4QheOlmMvIR3LTE-mmg	1	UgzsAPrAXwN7aQ3jXg54AaABAg	Katherine F

We don’t just see a correlation between industrialization and climate change and assume there’s causation: we can identify the compounds in the atmosphere that are causing its deterioration, trace the amounts of them in conjunction with our global output of greenhouse gases. And I’ll tell you why there aren’t tangible solutions being proposed in the comment section: because there aren’t any. Climate change is the most massive, all encompassing issue to face the human race in centuries. It will effect our habitable equatorial and coastal regions, air quality, ability to sustain the population through agricultural and marine sources, GDP, disease spread, political conflict, etc. And according to leading research, even mass negative emissions (which we don’t have yet have a means for yet) wouldn’t be enough to reverse all of the effects that currently threaten the human race. A solution would require just about every leader of a world power, every CEO, every politician to act against their personal and economic interests to support scientific progress and work out the ramifications of how we are going to sustain life. A problem is still a problem even if the solution to it is intangible, impossible, or non existent.

I’m not the most informed, but I believe we’ve been burning fossil fuels and releasing CO2 into the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution (which is what, almost three centuries ago?) And we continue pumping millions of metric tons of CO2 into the atmosphere daily. That most certainly is a factor in climate change. Again, though, I’d concede that I don’t know how the hell we’d realistically get the entire planet to switch from fossil fuels to renewable energy when there is so much money in that industry.

The Earth does it's thing. To assume that we are so influential as to cause the actual weather to change seems silly. Yes I know this is the exact argument of activists and that's where I disagree. It's a large leap in my mind to connect those two things. And the most important question is if we are in fact in charge of those changes, what specific actions would we actually need to take in order to reverse it? No one in the comments talking about that because no one actually knows. I don't know many people who wouldn't make changes if the changes were actaully identifiable and realistic. I think it's too easy to blame something so large and complex on something so simple. People like to think they have all the answers so quickly. I think the earth is larger and more complex than we make it out to be. Humans don't control it as much as we think. That was kind of my point. Thanks for commenting.

Yellowstone could erupt and wipe us out long before then, for example...You never know what the future might hold. We could also figure out terraforming and space travel and set up colonies on Mars/Venus by then. And I would imagine our technology will improve significantly within the next 20 years, so it's possible we will turn everything around before 100 years pass. As for the government...they're bad at everything. I think it's foolish to assume the governments of the world will somehow resolve these issues...most likely, the government will only make things worse. The more they get involved, the more expensive things become and the more likely technological advances stall. Better to take things to the private sector, where there's a lot more focus on resolving the problems.

What they are skeptical of are the so-called "solutions" that run rough-shod over realistic figures, ignore energy specialists, and strive for "socialist" agendas (i.e. The "Green New Deal", which is extremely political, and has little realism when it comes to solutions...AOC calls for things that current technology simply cannot achieve...basically, science fiction. Have you ever read that thing? Some of the so-called "technology" she demands are things that don't even exist, nor even have prototypes) It's dishonest to say that anyone who doesn't think your solutions are realistic or who is looking at all of the data and has determined that human influence is not the only factor in warming is "denying the science". The reality is that there are many, many factors involved in warming, and humans are not the only influence. A single volcanic eruption puts out as much CO2 as the U.S. does in a year...and there are many eruptions (mostly small) each year. Estimates put human activity as putting out only about 3% of carbon emissions on the planet...That's certainly enough to have *some* influence, but that also suggests other factors outside of human control have a larger impact. Of course, there are other gases to consider...but nobody ever talks about those, so the impact of other gases is not as clear. As for warming...the earth has been warming since the Ice Age began. I've taken several geology classes, and if you look at it from a geological perspective...we're actually far colder than the earth should be. In the time of dinosaurs, the earth was much, much warmer. Sea levels were higher....there's marks of sea water and ocean sediment in rocks in West Virginia, which is up in the Appalachian Mountains, far from the sea at this time... The question that scientists are still debating is how much humans are influencing things, and how much we can change at this time. Realistically, it would take far more than 10 years to have enough technological advances to move completely away from fossil fuels. Perhaps about 20 years, given current technology and efforts into improvements....if we're all going to die in 10 years, then it looks like we can't do a damned thing in the first place. And just for the record, I am not saying that the earth is not warming. It absolutely is. I'm saying that the best solution is to start the shift to nuclear power and to work on improving technology; however, that requires a realistic timeline. I'd say no less than 20 years, unless there's some new discovery in the upcoming years that would advance technology exponentially.

You make some pretty bold assumptions. - You do not know what she has done to educate herself on the topic. - You do not know if she is educated on the topic or not nor to what degree. - You do not know know how much life she has left in her. - I am willing to bet she was alive during a time when acid rain, smog, aerosols, etc. were an environmental issue. As for reading opinions. There is nothing wrong with that. You obviously feel strongly about this topic so you have done some amount of educating yourself on the topic. Yet I am confident that there are aspects you do not know and that you have relied upon some opinions. It is unlikely that people who are not spending the majority of their time on this topic would be able to keep up with everything on the topic. People have lives that need to be lived. So you make do the best you can with the time you have. If that means you have to rely on expert information rather than being the expert yourself so be it. You can still say you care about a topic and not be an expert on that topic. Opinions do matter even if they may be subjective. Opinions are also real. Your whole post was your opinion. Facts are important as they allow us to be more confident in our's and other's opinions.

I disagree with almost everything that lady said, but being so quick to discredit someone’s inquiry because the conclusion is unfavourable can be really fallacious. Is she wrong? I mean... probably. But to pass off all research that results in an unfavourable conclusion as “opinion” and not credible closes the door for academic opportunity, yknow? I don’t know, man... sometimes people can be wrong about something but still raise important questions or criticisms. But keep fighting the good fight, chief.

I've studied Ocean Acidification and the effects CO2 it has on the ocean. That may be a problem. The bigger issue for our Oceans is the over-fishing and toxic pollution from companies. That I can agree 100%. But to suggest that CO2 is enemy number 1 is a far cry to those problems. Tourism (something many people outside of your classroom rely on for a living) is a threat to corals. Look at it this way. 3 Million years ago the C02 in the atmosphere was the same. Do you think the coral reefs got wiped out? If the planet went through the same change during that age, how did we get corals today? Because life finds a way...

Some of it has to do with benefits to greenhouse gases. Going back to my first post, which isn't a theory but based on fact, greenhouses are for growing. So plant life thrives with these gases. Try to understand, life will go on with or without us. If we warm the planet to a level of 'mass extinction' me might die as a species, but life will go on. Earth survived meteor/asteroid strikes. It survived volcanoes. It survived Ice ages. Human civilization is a drop in the ocean compared to how old the Earth is and how long life has been here. Even if we are doing so much damage as the alarmists claim, nature will always find a way.

I’m not trying to be rude but I’m still in middle school and even I know the bad impacts of to much CO2. If you have the time my friend, please google some scholarly and credible articles about this topic, all the stuff you find out will surprise you and perhaps change your thinking about this topic. Good luck my friend and hopefully you are not as close minded as everyone here thinks you are.

Trees are good, yes, but biodiversity is dependent on many plant species and life. Anything that is green is photosynthesizing C02 to plant fibre. Soil degradation is because of poor land management practices. I've worked on a Gold Mine and I can tell you that there are efforts for remediation. We completely changed landscapes to divert a naturally flowing river and it looked barren. We planted lots of wildflowers, oats, and grasses to remediate the soil. The following season after planting, you couldn't notice giant soil ripping machines were there a year before.. The Real Estate Industry? That's your argument? There is a huge push for green spaces. People love seeing nature. In fact, there's a huge monetary incentive to green real-estate as housing prices dramatically increase if areas look kept and natural..

If you eat more than your recommended calorie intake, you grow more, thats just the facts. If there is more CO2 out there, then more plants can use it. If CO2 and Methane increase temperatures, it opens areas of the world that can sustain plant growth better than before. Excess doesn't mean bad.

You haven't disproved anything, and actually supported the fact. More plants = more ways nature can deal with the gas. More plants = more food. More plants = more wind breaks for areas that need them. More plants = a protective layer to prevent soil erosion. More plants = wildlife and ecosystems thrive. Whats your point?

Additional note: greenhouses (which are essentially closed systems to the outside world) are climate controlled which make an ideal environment for growing plant life.

Climate change aside, we need to get away from this attitude of just burning up resources stripped out of the planet. <br />Also people making money from these resources shouldn&#39;t be the ones influencing decisions about energy, yet lobbyists yet to spend their millions to ensure decisions are made, regardless of whether or not they are what is best for everyone.

Pretty much every mainstream prediction about melting ice caps, temperature rise and sea-level rise has turned out to be completely incorrect. The debate would still be open if there wasn't so much censorship from one side. And I'm not even a climate change skeptic. I just think that the crazy people who say we're all gonna die in 20 years are just that: crazy.

My point this entire time was to make clear the point the OP didn't understand. It is in fact true that there isn't enough land for green energy to replace fossil fuels. Not because there isn't enough power generation possible from green, but because the inherent limitation of green sources. We cannot tell make green sources produce on demand and we therefore are reliant on energy storage, which is insufficient currently, or fossil fuels to make up the gap.

Where i live biomass and biogas has been scaled threefold over a ten year period, using already available bi products. And i don't think it's accurate to say that molten salt hasn't been proven to work at scale, it's commercially viable and implemented in a lot of places, mostly with CSP plants. We have a broad array of viable options to phase out fossil fuels. So why on earth shouldn't we do it? Sure, we can't cut out all use of fossil fuels tomorrow, but the tech is here, and we need to scale it further.

All your solutions are not widely applicable. 1. Hydro storage doesn't work without grade because you need to pump the water up to elevation. Knocks out most of the US right there. 2. Hydrolysis hasn't been used it proven to work at scale for an electrical grid. Can it be used to fuel the few hydrogen cell cars? Yes. Has it been shown to be economical or practical at grid scale? No 3. Battery storage via lithium doesn't work at grid scale because if energy density. Hence why we use natural gas or coal to fill the gap in states like California or in countries like Germany. Returning to the whole point of this comment thread. I never said that we should not develop green energy sources. I simply said that green energy sources today cannot stand alone. They need fossil fuels because we do not have effective energy storage solutions at scale.

That is a fact. Also....sometimes reality doesn't agree with your let's just do it mentality.

And a lot has already been build. Biomass is a green energy source with no intermittency, solar thermal can deal with peak demands after the sun has gone down, pumped-storage hydropower can deal with intermittency. Car batteries can help stabilise the grid. And even if all these technologies weren't readily available, why wouldn't we invent them in order to deal with this problem. Intermittency is a problem we need to deal with as we scale up renewable power generation, but it's the least of our worries.

The problem with all green energy sources is not generating enough power. There is enough power generation obviously... The problem is power generation on demand to meet power demands of the grid. Good example is winter and solar energy. How much solar energy can you generate at night when the demand for electricity is high because of heaters in winter? Answer zero. You can't generate at night using solar. The same problem exists for all green energy sources because unlike a coal plant which we can flock on and off the sun and the wind don't care about human demans.

I personally do volunteer and donate, but those that don't I think are just confused and lost as to where to begin. I would not call them hypocrites, as they believe what they're saying. In regards to what you said about Gov. Intervention, I think that has some truth in it, but it's better to try and implement something that won't be perfect rather than nothing at all.

While they act as if they care deeply about a certain issues (climate change, income inequality or even child neglect), but can not be bothered with volunteering or even donating, becuse "individuals can not fix that" and just wait for the government to step in and force everyone to do something, regrdless of how (in)convenient it is. This seems rather hypocritical not to mention that the gov. intervention they demand is often the equivalent of repairing a wristwatch with a sledgehammer, being prone to mismanagements simply due to its large scale.

Yes, individuals make some difference, but at the end of the day big problems need big solutions. Some people will not change until it becomes more conveniant for them, or until it is deemed mandatory. That's where federal and local governments come in.

If we switch off of fossil fuel, it would have devastating consequences for innovation and economies considering literally every single thing that's manufactured comes from fossil fuel like oil whether in the form of energy or used to make plastic. Literally everything you own is made from fossil fuel. And by the way, the more financially well off people are, statistically, the more environmentally conscious they are, and fossil fuels boost economies that help people become better off financially because of its cheap and efficient energy. It brings people out of poverty.	UCwsreg1KIWi-ljco_6M1mcA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwsreg1KIWi-ljco_6M1mcA	1	Ugy8cdK_TtVAyZPoKeF4AaABAg	ChimeU95

Why is it natural for the beaver to build a dam, knowing full well it's not born with a dam and yet we say it naturally builds dams? Just something to think about. Also do you know because we switched to natural gas, we became more efficient than coal and emitted far less co2. In fact we reduced co2 as much as the entire EU combined because of our innovation with natural gas and fracking. In the fact, the vast majority of the decline in co2 emissions is statistically attributed to natural gas. Since 2005 annual U.S. carbon dioxide emissions have declined by 758 million metric tons. That is by far the largest decline of any country in the world over that timespan and is nearly as large as the 770 million metric ton decline for the entire European Union.

"the earth is mostly self-regulating in terms of its environment" The Earth does to a certain extent, but since we are interfering with the climate, that is no longer the case. Edit: I should say, "... that is no longer the case to the extent the Earth needs for sustainability." And I totally agree with your last point. Small sample size isn't a very good representation of the supporting populus behind the claim.

I don't believe it's completely self-regulating: again, we partially contributed to the earth's climate today (with the unnatural extraction of fossil fuels and such, the other part coming from natural parts of the earth's ecosystem) so we need to work on helping to fix it. I just think that other than human contributions to the environment, the earth has self-regulated before and it will do it again. Our main problem is figuring out an alternative energy source so we can stop contributing negatively to the atmosphere; then the earth will regulate over time. Yes, it's gonna take a while to come back from the damage that's been done, but our role as humans needs to be figuring out how to fix the problem in the long run instead of figuring out how to get rid of it temporarily. I'm thinking of it in terms of what you said about a living being. If you feed a living being healthy food, its body will self-regulate. If it is sick, good nutrition will help it get back to being healthy. In other words, we need to target the source and work our way out from there.

But like I mentioned in my above comment, I am actually a civilized being and believe that we should constantly try to make progress towards being completely environmentally friendly. However, I believe it’s a process. I also know that the climate has fluctuated drastically before without human interference, and that it’s very likely it will do it again. Yes, the introduction of fossil fuels has been damaging to the environment, I won’t deny that. But if cows are supposedly even more damaging to the atmosphere and the earth regulated itself with them before the advent of industrial pollution, then it should be able to do something similar until we figure out and implement a realistic and sustainable alternative.

I’m not trying to refute the fact that us dumping garbage into the oceans is a horrible thing, but our this conversation was originally about climate change, specifically relating to gasses. Are fossil fuels bad for the environment and should we keep trying to find and use alternatives? Yes. Is the earth going to dispel those fossil fuels in the future and return to its natural state (as long as we continue trying to find alternatives for fossil fuels)? Yes. I think you misunderstand what I’m trying to say. I believe that humans should continuously be working towards making everything as environmentally friendly as possible. But I also believe that the earth is very good at preserving itself and its natural life, so it will naturally regulate itself over time. I’m just saying that in the millions of years that Earth has existed, our contributions to its environment are rather small.

If he spent his entire life in primary school, high school, university and then his career RESEARCHING into a topic, he wouldn&#39;t let other people just brush him off just because of a religious, non-evidence based statement. Religion does not take place before other people who lead complex lives just as complex as yours. They also worry about keeping up with the latest news, shoes, etc. you aren&#39;t in a simulation where everyone else is just a robot.<br />P.S.

Ugws1CboEM4JBRw-yqZ4AaABAg	0	2	2020-03-05 08:53:17	megan moo	I&#39;m an Environmental Studies (focus on policy and economy) and Economics (business management, corporate finance) student at UC Santa Cruz. Here are some of my takes on the opinions expressed in the video! I am by no means an expert but I look forward to having a discussion with you all.<br /><br /><br />Prompt 1: I care about the environment.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH__Fa2yqnE&amp;t=2m18s">2:18</a> I appreciate that this gentleman, Alex, clearly states his world view as it relates to environment. I&#39;m looking forward to how his anthropocentric views will manifest in his other answers. Based on the comments I have seen, this is something that people didn&#39;t pick up on and I think it is really important in order to contextualize his responses. Whether this view is empirically correct or ethically sound, I am not the judge of. Anyway, it sounds like he&#39;s down for geoengineering too.<br /><br /><br />Prompt 3: I am well informed on this topic.<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH__Fa2yqnE&amp;t=4m25s">4:25</a> Good on Jeremy for not being afraid to say that he isn&#39;t an expert. I&#39;m not an expert either. I tell my students all the time that &quot;No, I don&#39;t know&quot; is a good and valid answer.<br /><br /><br />Prompt 4: Climate change activists are often hypocrites.<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH__Fa2yqnE&amp;t=6m38s">6:38</a> I think the point Keith presents is a double edged sword. If they don&#39;t empty their pockets for the cause, they&#39;re hypocrites. If they do, they&#39;re shills who are just doing it for the pats on the back and good PR.<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH__Fa2yqnE&amp;t=7m18s">7:18</a> I appreciate that Jeremy is rather open minded about this. I, however, do not necessarily think that eliminating all cars in the world is a great idea, especially in the US where public transit and other forms of transportation are so underdeveloped and many cities/suburbs are not walking or biking friendly.<br /><br /><br />Prompt 5: We should stop the polar ice caps from melting. Yikes.<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH__Fa2yqnE&amp;t=7m40s">7:40</a> I agree with Michael that the melting and refreezing of ice caps is a natural process. However, based off of the information I have seen, it seems that the area of the ice caps on average, have been reducing in area over the last 30 years. I could be wrong though, don&#39;t want to rule that possibility out.<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH__Fa2yqnE&amp;t=7m59s">7:59</a> I would say the question of &quot;do we need to stop this from happening&quot; depends on your world view and what you think the human-environment relationship should look like. It is possible however, to slow these processes down through engineering, which is also ethically arguable.<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH__Fa2yqnE&amp;t=8m11s">8:11</a> I have not seen the information that this gentleman, Arthur, has brought up but I would like to present one point. He is stating that on a short term, micro level, the relation between I assume, sea level rise and possible submergence of coastal and island communities has been clearly determined. I think there is potential that these effects on a long term, macro level could be very different, depending on ways we address climate. The precautionary principle would be very beneficial to employ here, so we don&#39;t make detrimental decisions while the science is still emerging.<br /><br /><br />Prompt 7: If the polar bears went extinct I would be sad.<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH__Fa2yqnE&amp;t=10m57s">10:57</a> I&#39;m not sure that low cost energy gives us the ability to save anything we want other than money. Basic supply and demand, if price goes down, the quantity demanded will increase. I think something that was perhaps edited out was the discussion of what types of energy sources would be used to generate this low cost energy.<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH__Fa2yqnE&amp;t=11m09s">11:09</a> I mean there is a &quot;so what&quot; in terms of the arctic ecosystem that but that&#39;s not really the question being asked I suppose :)<br /><br /><br />Prompt 8: Future generations will have a worse environment than now.<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH__Fa2yqnE&amp;t=11m40s">11:40</a> I&#39;m not sure how long we can use fossil fuels freely as Alex suggests. I&#39;m sure he is much more well studied than I am though. Even as an environmental scholar, I find Greta Thunberg preachy and cringy. I think I would agree, conditionally, to Alex&#39;s argument that there is no environment more nourishing, safe or full of opportunity. There is so much more food calorically being produced on Earth now and that has totally been driven by things like the Green Revolution, but I would argue that there are an equal amount of non-nutritous food being produced i.e. Doritos and other refined corn products. I love myself a Dorito but the national and global distribution of these resources should also be addressed. Overall, yeah. Practically all industrialized countries have gotten to this point in time, because coal fueled the Industrial Revolution.<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH__Fa2yqnE&amp;t=12m33s">12:33</a> I, as someone born and raised in Northern California and currently live in Central California, I blame wildfires on PG&amp;E :P More people are living in the urban-wilderness interface and that just means that more fires are going to start. However, excessive nutrient inputs like pesticide runoff allows for plants to grow wildly, building up lots of biomass. Increasing temperatures, or just the already high average summer temperatures in CA dry up all of that fuel. If there&#39;s a spark or some coastal lightning, we get fire. As warming increases, winds like the Santa Ana winds will intensify and work to spread these fires even more. I believe that fires will be intensified by climate change. This is based on the information I have been presented, I would love to hear about the other information that Keith references at the end of his point.<br /><br /><br />Prompt 9: I am willing to change my mind.<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH__Fa2yqnE&amp;t=15m55s">15:55</a> I know that what Alex is saying is polarizing for many environmentalists but I do agree with him, based on the fact that he is approaching this from an anthropocentric point of view. For the betterment of humanity specifically, increasing access to fuel is part of that solution. Just remember that humanity and the environment are not the same thing, in this type of view. For people who disagree, I present a couple questions that I have asked my students: Is it really fair for the US and UK, as countries that have built empires on coal and gas, to tell countries looking towards energy for economic development that they are not allowed to use them because it’s “dirty” and it causes climate change? What should we do instead? Is providing people with clean, renewable energy sources really a fair replacement? <br /><br /><br />Thanks to Jubilee for making this video! I thought it was really interesting and I will be sharing this with my friends and students. Goodhumans, please don&#39;t rip me a new one :D	UCPR8Q5B6MLGpJ_WmF05PsGw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPR8Q5B6MLGpJ_WmF05PsGw	0

The process of peer review is essentially the exercise of skepticism. A skeptic doesn&#39;t have to oppose that of which he is skeptical. Portraying &#39;the other side&#39; as alarmists just makes it look like they&#39;re not thinking critically, and this happens constantly when it comes to topics that have an overwhelming body of evidence. Just like how flat earthers think everyone who believes in a globe earth is simply not critical enough of their own worldview.

Now is all summer or weird winter. <br />Less than 10 years ago was normal to have snow in my hometown from end od November to begining of February. Now I can remebmer when was last time that we had snow. Now temperature during a winter are all over the place, one day it is -10°C (14°F), and litteraly the next day is 26°C (79°C). Last Christmas it was even 28°C (83°F)<br />If you want to see changes try planting a garden...those sudden changes are killing the plants. So you can&#39;t grow anything without greenhouse where you can control things.<br />Because now we have crazy winter with temperature that are for few days above 10°C (50°F) that messes with plants who start to blossom, and only few days after temperature is below 0°C (32°F) which kills the flower from the fruit tree and that for that year you probably don&#39;t have fruit on that tree.<br />I would like to ask them have they ever step foot out side of &#39;Merica?, how much time per week do they spend in nature?, how much to they know about gardening or agronomy? <br />They probably don&#39;t know anything that is why they act like that. <br /><br />...<br />And the thing that frustrates me the most is that we are small country, without big industry and yet we suffer because of people like that in the video who are selfish and care about themselfs.

The people that are educated work in an industry that accelerates climate change and the others don&#39;t have a clue because don&#39;t see the bigger picture.<br />There is a reason why almost 99% of researchers, the people that deal with this topic everyday on the highest level of credibility, agrees that the human race accelerated the climate change in the last 200 years in a way that it is already noticeable. We have technology that gives us the ability to study our past and present environment and pretty much all results disagree with pretty much any of their arguments.

There might be for example a disharnomy between attitudes or behaviors (for example; I don&#39;t like the thought of the environment suffering but I do like the behaviors that cause the environment to suffer). Something must change to eliminate the dissonance and there to be harmony. We can either choose to change our behavior (I don&#39;t like the thought of the environment suffering so I&#39;m gonna make that explicit if someone asks and at least try to behave sustainably when I can) or we can choose to change the original attitude (Actually, I don&#39;t even care about the environment so I&#39;m gonna continue behaving in a way that might harm the environment or decide I don&#39;t believe there even is a problem with my behavior). These guys are a fine example of the latter.	UCBEp4uaSzga14ssb-hCWiLg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBEp4uaSzga14ssb-hCWiLg	0

They balance the predator and prey numbers, allow plants and other organisms to grow and flourish and those then feed the tiny little birds and small fishes that swim in the sea to survive- I could explain the whole thing to you but I would recommend for you to do some independent research and read a few trusted scientific journals on ecology to gain a better understanding of how an ecosystem works, since you're a part of one too.

The natural extinction of a specie isn’t the same thing as a provoked one. It’s okay to not care but it’s the same as saying « I don’t care if my way of living and the way of living of my specie causes the death of other species, and I don’t care if my actions are detrimental to the planet’s natural balance. »	UC2KEBXKtrM2aCJV3M3oKjww	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2KEBXKtrM2aCJV3M3oKjww	1	Ugz7i-Anx3DfXXKIw_14AaABAg	cottagem

Michael somewhat touched on it with her point about the polar ice caps melting and refreezing. I believe the environment is very important, and that there are measures we need to take as a whole to ensure that we take care of it. However, I also believe that while humans have an impact, the earth largely self-regulates. The climate is going to be constantly changing. We’ve seen evidence of that fact with the ice ages coming and going, and in our modern world, the polar ice caps are currently melting, but that doesn’t mean they won’t refreeze in a hundred years.

We see this very commonly, if we sat down together and spoke at length we would undoubtedly find opinions we both hold that go against the general opinions of experts in the relevant field, and it would be very difficult for us to concede that we are most likely wrong, because that's just how our brains work. I wouldn't be surprised if you are already thinking "i wouldn't necessarily be likely wrong" even though this is a hypothetical situation. It's that feeling that tells us we are correct that is cognitive bias, and by no means do I think I am free of it, bias effects us all, myself included. All we can do to counter it is to try and accept being wrong as an important part of the learning process, rather than instinctively defending every opinion we hold, especially when we quite regularly come to our opinions very quickly, without much information at all.

Most people advocating for nuclear agree that a good proportion of energy (the degree depends on the specific environment of course) can come from renewables. Their point is that if you want to get away from fossil fuels, you can't ignore nuclear, because solar/wind/hydro have fluctuations that HAVE to be compensated to have a stable power grid (ask any physicist or engineer, they will tell you that). So any environmentalist advocating for the stop of using fossil fuels is living in an uninformed and unscientific dreamland, which will destroy our way of living, and accomplishing nothing good.

The alarmist types mostly aren't scientist, they're just hysteric, they ignore nuclear power as a reliable energy source alongside renewables and paint scenarios that are not based on science and rather activism to further their point, they claim to know science, but their knowledge is that of the first two lines of a wikipedia page on any given subject.

That is a fact and almost every economist will agree with me there. I would venture to say 97% would haha.

HOWEVER, nuclear energy when used in the discourse actually serves nothing but to stall the debate, it's basically an "all or nothing" mentality. Instead of having either nuclear or solar/wind/hydro, we get nothing, and fossil fuel corporations wins while pro and against nuclear environmentalists argued. Nuclear is safe, yes, but in the debate, it always ended up as a mean to inaction.	UCvcBqkx0rmKaJ_acK6dfSAQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvcBqkx0rmKaJ_acK6dfSAQ	1	Ugx6dX_saiouFrG5Nql4AaABAg	Kara

We can argue political matters with politicians because we are or can become informed as to the effects of their policies, because we live directly under those effects and we are the experts of our own experiences. We can also become informed on climate science, but actual expertise has a much higher barrier to entry. You won't be able to learn as much as a climatologist did in their schooling and continues to learn in their job simply by googling, or by looking around you and saying that things look fine now.

The ice caps contain freshwater. Many fish in the ocean are built for handling salt water. You can kind of see how drastically changing the ratio of salt to freshwater might negatively impact some or many fish in the ocean.<br /><br />2. The more the ice caps melt, the deeper the ocean gets. The deeper the ocean gets, the darker its surface gets. The darker its surface gets, the more heat is getting absorbed. The more heat that gets absorbed, the faster the ice caps will melt. This is kind of something you could easily see becoming a snowball effect, especially with how decreasing the surface area and volume of the ice caps likewise increases the amount of impact the heat will have.

Around 65-75percent of the oxygen in earth’s atmosphere comes from the ocean and about 1/4 of the earth’s human population relies directly on the ocean as their main source of food. As atmospheric CO2 increases, so does the acidity of our oceans, and so do the problems facing marine organisms. I don’t get it how people lack the understanding that we NEED nature to be stable for the long term survival of our species... This is regardless of moral and ethical reasons concerning animals, it is about the survival of our own species.	UCjxFQBjuEjOOWOs3ak_8zIw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjxFQBjuEjOOWOs3ak_8zIw	0

And I find it dangerous to even entertain the idea that we should just start talking over facts. No opinion could change the fact that climate change is real &amp; is effected by &amp; effects us directly. So we shouldn’t confuse opinion and fact. It’s not something we can afford right now to sit here &amp; debate over any longer. Idk what they’re talking about. So much information IS or HAS BEEN out there. Seek it! Humans, along with many other species, are already suffering devastating consequences of the climate crisis. And there are so many simple/affordable/reasonable ways for us, even as individuals, to minimize our negative impact on the environment. Including acknowledging the FACT of our relation to everything in it, first &amp; foremost. Respecting science, vegetarianism, veganism, activism, buying things second hand, taking shorter showers, recycling, going solar, minimizing waste, going no-plastic, paying attention/educating ourselves...just to name a few. I wish jubilee included some facts about climate change at the end for those out there who may think like this, and need some resources they might not seek out otherwise. Especially during such crucial times. Enough climate change denial. We shouldn’t make space for it. Truth is we don’t have time for it. I maybe would’ve found more value in this conversation if it were a “middle ground” video instead.	UCKpOg8I7yc2_-uDSKJ9jXnw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKpOg8I7yc2_-uDSKJ9jXnw	0

I live on a farm and we have experienced all of our creeks and waterways drying up (which has never happened before) and we have been actively ready for bushfires on our property. Every single well respected scientist has linked all these abnormalities to climate change. As a person on the front lines of when climate change is really doing to people I believe these views are really damaging and will stop our government taking real action on the route on the problem.

If you want a book that talks about the dangers of climate change without any excess alarmism I can recommend a section of the book Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress by Steven Pinker.

Polar ice caps melting raises sea level, causes floods, people die for one example. Not wanting to attempt to prevent these mass deaths is kind of selfish, especially when it's mostly because people want to live beyond their means. We are also not seperate from the environment. We depend on the natural world, it's death is a massive restructuring of our world far more extreme than what activists suggest now. Science does say this is a massive issue for the natural world and therefore us as well. Can I ask your education on the subject?

There have been a lot of incredibly large changes in the climate since homo sapiens have existed and if our ancestors could survive that without any useful technology, the idea that we couldn't do that now with all our tech and infrastructure is just wrong. Homo sapiens are by far the most adaptable species that have ever existed on this planet. Climate change is undoubtedly a problem that will cost human lives, but the idea that it's a potential apocalypse for humanity is just not backed by science.

It doesn't matter if you have enough solar panels to power a city 3 times over, when you have power demand at night....guess how much solar you get when the sun sets? Zero. That's why there isn't enough land. Choose your green energy source and the problem is the exact same. Wind? Can you control when it blows? No...Tidal? Can you control the tides? No... The one exception is maybe hydro dams. However that is geographically limited and environmentally devastating...look at the Yangze Dams. So yes...there isn't enough land if you only use green. You need a fossil fuel source to meet grid demand when the sun stops shining, the wind isn't, blowing and the tide isn't changing.

The humanist ideology and religious justification are updating to see as they are the hardest to change. This was also a window into their education on climate change. The data is in controverable on the side of climate change. Also they each clearly demonstrated fundamental failings of logic as to the future of laws and willingness to make progress. Their humanist avoidance of ’systemic reversion’ is sadly strengthening a status quo mentality which is at odds with the required technological progress that will save nature. Also just a side note, the concept of using Genisis (before humans mess it all up) to justify anti-climate change is ironic and backwards in so many ways.

Fossil fuels will be contentiously used until depleted. The aftermath and byproducts released from fracking for fossil fuels causes a toxic slush that pollutes local water and soil (making it so no locals can drink or grow food). Yeah maybe electric cars arnt perfect at the moment, but if you think about how long have we came in technology in the past 10/20 years, it makes me have hope in a sustainable transportation solution possibly through electric cars. In all what I’m getting to.... it’s better to be optimistic then pessimistic ;) we could get way farther.	UCOklS81rLtWsXyFAgjChf9w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOklS81rLtWsXyFAgjChf9w	0

Did you know that Germany is going to be only using 20-35% fossil fuels to power there country by 2040. Leaving a whooping 65-80% percentage that will be powered through a renewable energy. Maybe should have left Germany out of this😂.

Fossil fuels will never be depleted because there will come a point where the marginal cost of producing a barrel of oil through drilling or fracking will exceed the marginal revenue from selling that barrel, meaning there will still be oil long after it is profitable to drill for it.

A lot of variables in this sentence, they believe they are knowledgeable based on their own research in which no one knows what they read who they really listen to what they believe is fact versus what perspective. Many research are done based on a bias of their own initial beliefs in the first place. Omitting the points that they could very much be wrong whether they are on climate side or non-climate takes very light of the situation.

I think all of them have good intentions: they want humanity to thrive, and they don&#39;t want us to panic about something that may/may not be an issue. However. I will say that just as some of them believed the alarmists to be hypocrites, and I think they too can fit into that category by a lack of how much humans need the environment to stay the way it is. We have seen the impact that happens when an animal is not present in a certain environment, or what happens when these animals migrate to new places that are not supposed to cater to them. There are instances where prey animal numbers EXPLODE because their predator disappears (which is what will happen with polar bears if they become extinct or move out of their zones), and vice versa. If these populations are affected, this may also affect means of providing food, or it can affect things like crops/rail systems/cities because these animals are migrating to take refuge in the human spaces that we have upkept.<br /><br /><br />Fossil fuels will eventually run out, that&#39;s what makes it non-renewable. So many conflicts have been caused because of this need for fossil fuels, which has led to loss of life. Renewable energy such as solar and wind, however, can generally be made anywhere. Each country can be independent, and thus use the money that would have been spent on importing oil on something else. Panels and turbines can work for years at a time with minimal upkeep, which is absolutely incredible! Secondly, there was an article a while back about how all it takes is solarpanel space the size of Germany to power the <i>whole</i> planet. Spread that out, and that is not much space at all.

We should involve all sustainable energy sources. In Germany more than a third (like 35%) of all energy comes from sustainable energies already... but Germany doesn't even use a third of it's land mass to get it. If you can calculate you know it cannot be true what Michael tell us. To have enough energy Germany has to use 2.5 % of it land mass for sustainable energies, which is even possible for Germany. The USA (9.834.000 km²) is about 27.5 times bigger than Germany (357.386 km²) has more sustainable energy sources. And compared to it's land mass is has much less inhabitants than Germany. (USA: 35.8 inhabitants per 1 km². Germany: 232 inhabitans per 1 km²). So no Michael...Land mass cannot be a problem. Pretty weak for 10 years or reading about it.

Bu now we have more knowledge and we should try to move away from them. Even if you dont believe it has an impact on the climat (global warming) nobody can deny it has an effect on the environment (air quality). And as cities keep on growing smog keeps on getting a bigger issue, using electric transportation would help that and in that way resolve a lot of health issues aswell as the climatechange (witch you might or might not believe in)	UCqk14cQw41dfa-D_v-RANPQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqk14cQw41dfa-D_v-RANPQ	1	Ugz-g4jRf5XfgGe2jhV4AaABAg	Shaun Yoong

(Incidentally, they tend to often be the greatest producers of fossil fuels.) I'm not a climate change denier by any means, but I also disagree with the rhetoric of shame. In many cases, certain fossil fuels are the only option, such as in flights and industrialization. I would prefer that we continue to develop clean methods of transportation and clean energy sources, but I understand why an outright ban would be impractical at this point in time.

Humans will survive. Humans are overpopulating the planet as we know it. That is why we have an increase on everything (economy, disease, poverty, weather destroying homes, etc). More people = more results for all our metrics about society. The environment can take care of itself. We have technology now that can help us survive on Mars if we wanted.

Human beings philosophically can be considered nature and in that sense there's no obvious opposition between being humanist and loving nature. The thing is humanism is a term that is used in different ways by different people without defining in the intrinsic parameters behind it. Humanism at the source, in the 16th century was a movement that places "human beings and their qualities + values" at the center of everything. Literature, art... were a product of that and were sanctified. But the main question to me is what qualities and values are we talking about? Is critical thinking for instance, something promoted by Humanism in the later 16th, a core component of human beings, validating the existence of these pieces of opinion of these people? I do admit that his definition of humanism is extremely peculiar but it's his definition based on his set of values. In that sense he places humans at the center with his sets of values. He believes that the world would be better off with fossil fuels etc. these are sets of values from that past in which they believe and humans should be a part of. Personally, I disagree with him but it's his set of values.	UC4mCquieJNYvQ9OlRVgLbjQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4mCquieJNYvQ9OlRVgLbjQ	1	Ugyf8NiYq0C3wJFZ7Ht4AaABAg	Lilian Ransel

We can alter the envirormente way more of what you way think. Just create an genetic agent and bring to the extinction the bees, for example. You may not see the consequences of it now, but our childrens would. And that is the thing. Is NOW when we are starting to see some real effect of our actions in the planet. We cant destroy the Earth, not even with nuclear power but we can distroy ourselves by alterating the envirorment.

The Earth went through some massive extinctions, naturally, before we ever existed.. The Earth went through Ice Ages...and Asteroid Impacts. Those examples are just off the top of my head and I'm not even trying here.. Life will always find a way and bounce back. It may not be a perfect vision of what you have in mind with what species might or might not survive, but it will go on with or without us. In other words, what The Earth will have going on will be perfect per say and it doesn't need you or any of us to have that vision.

It means recognizing that humans have within them the ability to be a positive force in the world and when given the opportunity humans will make good choices because of an innate moral code and not because of man-made gods. He&#39;s not a humanist he&#39;s a specist.<br /><br />It&#39;s possible to be both a humanist and also sometimes put our own interests above animals. I believe some animal testing in order to create vaccines for diseases is OK. I&#39;m a meat eater. Could we do better with the conditions that we put these animals through to get what we need out of them? Absolutely. It&#39;s such a nuanced topic and so I climate change. <br /><br />I am neither a climate change activist nor a denier but I do believe if we can make adjustments to how we live our lives it can only help in the long run. I live in a developing country (Indonesia) that is is contributing to a lot of pollution in the world and trying to deal with a mindset where littering is OK and polluting rivers and oceans is a normal activity. But in recent years I&#39;ve seen a green movement here (banning plastic bags, major river clean ups, car free days etc) and this is all because of the activists.<br /><br />I think we reasonable people can agree we don&#39;t need alarmists on either side just a healthy honest discourse regarding the world and the willingness to listen and adapt your beliefs regardless of what side you fall on.

I don’t think climate change isn’t happening, so saying climate change denier is wrong. Skeptic makes more sense as I’m skeptical of how much impact we as humans have on the planet. Personally I do think humans have an influence on the planet, however I don’t think we are causing changes in the climate as mainstream media implies we are. So specifically addressing the question “would I deny humans as a cause or temperature changes?” I would say yes, I believe humans have a very, very minimal affect on the changes in earths climate. I do think humans have an impact on nature, I just don’t think we are responsible for the changes in earths overall climate. I hope this clears things up and answers your questions appropriately. If you have more I’d be happy to answer them, and thank you for being respectful and not attacking me for having differing views.

Even if it might not've come across, my problem was largely with her seeming confirmation bias. As in it seeming like she just want to confirm her belief that we should stick to fossil fuels. If she honestly had been pondering it, the argument would be questioning why we should rather than if we could, as Moore does. It's also dishonest to only mention wind and solar as replacement for fossils as hydro and bio are far more prevalent. And even then her comment is about available land rather than feasibility. All that combined really upset my need for intellectual curiosity.	UC9hQO5RIhSmKPJrFvRRu1YQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9hQO5RIhSmKPJrFvRRu1YQ	1	Ugxvqnj_ngXbfwT7am14AaABAg	Meghan Kiese

Hydropower can be devastating to local fauna and the lithium needed for solar and wind to be viable isn’t great either. India’s and China’s research into thorium reactors is promising.

That is why he will flood our coastal cities with the ice caps we melted, burn our homes with the heat we created, and fill our bodies with the plastic we have littered.

Look into Predictive Programming by Alan Watts on YT and that, with opening up the mind to the real world outside of TV and video and movies, will make sense, maybe. Warning though it is longer than 5/10/15 minutes which is understandably and unfortunately cringed by many people esp younger people or adults that have been indoctrinated if a info video is any longer than those times. These smart people I know didn't know what indoctrinated definition is and believed in the short story version of the founding of the US was based simply on mass genocide rather than the grueling centuries of warring (and unity) that it really was. All that i speak of has been a part of the mass infiltration of modern day public schools and universities esp since the advent of the TV in the 50's and abuse of freedom of the press methods.

Like nobody argues that we should care for the planet simply because it is the right thing to do. Don’t say oh the world is ending so we should take steps to prevent that. Anyone with any common sense knows that it’s wrong to go somewhere and leave it dirty and broken.	UCeRQO1IUZs2Gm-LmtfZilfA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeRQO1IUZs2Gm-LmtfZilfA	0

I&#39;ve spent a lot of time reading technical reports of the matter. The global sea level is rising which has been determined through simple data collection. I have no idea where these people do their research that says otherwise. It astounds me to see people get so many facts wrong and yet completely confident in themselves.

I can see why you believe that climate change advocates are hypocrites and how the earth should be centered around humans but you have to at least acknowledge that climate change is real. if we dont do anything to fix that, then we will eventually need to do something.

It doesn&#39;t matter what you &quot;believe&quot; the SCIENTIFIC FACT IS THAT IT IS ALWAYS OCCURRING. Climate change is the conglomeration of processes that effect the environment and weather. It isn&#39;t 1 single measurable thing. The climate on the Earth is always fluctuating. Have humans impacted the Earth and the environment around them? Fuck yes. We have a huge population, it&#39;s inevitable. But there is no metric to measure exactly how great that impact is. The Earth went through heating and cooling cycles and there were MASS EXTINCTIONS before humans were anywhere near thought of. What &quot;climate change&quot; is right now is a political scare tactic. Nobody is actually presenting a metric of human involvement. Nor is there any data that we could somehow &quot;reverse our negative environmental impact&quot; whatever it is. But most importantly... they&#39;re not proposing a solution... especially A viable solution that the whole world could and would enact. You can cripple US industry until it&#39;s nothing and everybody could eat vegan or whatever and that would only erase a tiny FRACTION of global emissions/pollution. The average person could live a super sustainable and low impact life and it would get wiped out by 1 rich politician flying their private jet on vacation. And lastly, even though people don&#39;t want to hear it.... the world doesn&#39;t &quot;end&quot; if for some reason the Earth become inhabitable for human life. The planet will be fine.... it&#39;ll still be here trucking on, changing and evolving, there will probably even be other life here after humans are dead.

If you reread my comment I never said that. But good job injecting your politics into a comment that addresses how a fire was indeed big. Also to the people who are saying he was comparing it to asteroid events and volcano eruptions, yes, that would make more sense why he used “little” , thank you.

They aren't trying to appease tree huggers who have no power, they openly mock them. They didn't burn off because conditions wouldn't allow it. NSW had been in drought for years, the bush was tinder dry, the 2019 winter was extremely short and the fire season started months in advance. The tourism industry in Sydney and good ole' Gladys didn't like the smoke that comes from burning off either. However even in areas where there had been burning off, the fire was that ferocious it tore through there regardless. It is the largest fire we have recorded in Australia, not the deadliest for people but the largest in terms of size. If you are interested in learning more about the history of Australian fires I would suggest a documentary made about the 2009 Black Saturday fires called Inside the Firestorm. It shows the complexity of fires in Australia from the perspective of those that lived through them.

These zones receive sunlight at a much higher rate than the other zones. Naturally, these areas can be dry.. Half of Australia is in it. The other half is in the sub-tropical zone (or the NSW). So, maybe starting fires isn't a good thing in an area where naturally these conditions can exist. In Canada, when things get warm and dry (even in a temperate climate) we still can have fires that can get out of control and destroy towns. So, we impose fire bans...

Sure, how a fire starts is very important, but a fire doesn't last long without the right conditions, and that is where climate change comes in.

I have family that work in the fire brigade, they were so sick and tired of hearing that somehow the government stopped them from back burning. There was basically a perfect storm of poor weather conditions over the last few years reducing back burning, but also they don't think any amount of back burning could of stopped the fires we had because of the extreme conditions. It didn't rain were I live for 3 months straight. They were just hoping for any rain to come and give them a break, but it never happened. It was really depressing, and bad enough without people trying to cast blame.

Ugzo8HbXN_5YyPeGdSl4AaABAg	0	0	2020-03-05 04:23:16	dreamlaughwishful	Why is the focus always on climate?? Yes climate change is important to think about, but if you approach this topic from another lens, I truly think we can make more progress. Focus on the linkages between coal mine workers and silicosis and other respiratory illnesses. Focus on water pollution and how oil is difficult to effectively remove from a water column. Focus on micro and nano plastics in the ocean and impact on the fishing industry. Focus on how soil quality is decreasing due to modern farming practices and subsequently future higher prices of food at a lower quality. Focus on the honeybees dying and how without them, we cannot have effective pollination and idk FOOD. It can be very difficult for people to understand things they A) are not educated on and B) cannot see right before their eyes like a cause and effect. I get that they don&#39;t need to see anything when it comes to religion, but it&#39;s easy for them to conceptualize. Hearing the poorly supported points they made today was frustrating, but it goes to show how the way we are trying to make change is not working. And while I completely disagree with them, we need to show them the benefits of updating our practices. I think the way they think is gross, but like the producer said at the beginning, compassion is important.	UC2bmh8DRIQw9AY673xaewgA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2bmh8DRIQw9AY673xaewgA	0

We need to point fingers at china, india, all these other countries that do not regulate air pollution, do not recycle solid waste. And do not handle solid and liquid waste properly. I feel in the US our biggest issue is not air pollution from factories and such but rather solid and liquid wastes not being disposed of properly. There are so many areas around the country that have stopped collecting recyclables and they just dispose of all of it into the normal dump, because it cost more money to sort through the plastics, metals, and cardboards. I don&#39;t think in particular pollution is causing the earth to warm up. The earth has gone through ice ages and heat up cycles since the dawn of time. I dont see why we wouldnt be going into a &quot;heat age&quot;. last cycle we knew and have scientific evidence of was an ice age, right? So it just makes sense to me. Could air pollution be a contributing factor yes, but i don&#39;t think lowering it is going to stop the earth from doing it&#39;s thing. Im all for cleaning up the ecosystem and the air, but i don&#39;t think people are focusing right.	UC5_BLSWSu3ybB_17hwGekLw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5_BLSWSu3ybB_17hwGekLw	0

However, that is only in the short term. Cows actually emit a gas called methane, which breaks down after a couple of decades, versus CO2, which can remain in the atmosphere for centuries. So if we're talking about the next 20 years, cows would have a greater impact on the environment than vehicles, but if we're talking about the long-term, say a couple centuries, then vehicles have a higher greenhouse gas emission rate than cows.

Add more water vapour and it rains a little harder somewhere. The amount of water vapour is dependent largely on the ambient temperature of the air.

The cows get their carbon from eating plants which got their carbon from the air. The cows are returning that same carbon to the air - net result zero. Cars get their carbon from fossil fuels and net result is a 50% increase in CO2 in the last 200 years, most of it in the last 50.

It basically means that the presence of other gases in the atmosphere leads to more water vapor forming which adds to global warming. So cutting down other emissions would automatically reduce the water vapor. hope this is better	UCCpP02b_yursYec_F4b-0iw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCpP02b_yursYec_F4b-0iw	1	UgzGx5kEImoseTsjusJ4AaABAg	Harshita

UgyD37Khz5Z8HVKPxSR4AaABAg	0	0	2020-03-05 04:09:20	Great Gouda	Alright all the &quot;climate change&quot; people explain this too me, why was the hottest day on record in 1913 and not in 2019-2020? And if the 1913 reading is incorrect due to reading issues recently discovered (convenient) then why is the next highest temperature on record in 1961 and not 2019-2020? See, I am seeing an increase in the last 3-4 years across Europe but almost no where else, in fact Australia&#39;s hottest day on record a damned hot place by the way was in 1960.... You can claim &quot;well its slowly increasing&quot; and yet....if that were true the hottests days on record would be revised much more frequently globally. Yes Regionally temperatures maybe risings but why are some of the hottest places in the world &quot;stable&quot; and the not so hot places not? Nobody has been able to give me a reasonable and logical answer yet. <br /><br />I should also point out that we&#39;re claiming arrogance right now pretending we know &quot;enough&quot; to state we&#39;re destroying ourselves rapidly and its all us and yet we have no true way of determining the temperature of the world 10000 years ago, 100000 years ago and further back. Our sample size is too small. Meaning the increases in temp can be down to a natural cycle that we simply are are unable to see currently due to us not being able to monitor the world like we can now for 1000s of years. Does that mean we aren&#39;t harming our planet? Of course we are but right now people are grossly exaggerating. If you want to help deal with pollution do something practical like actually economically sanctioning and restricting South Americas ability to destroy the rain-forests which naturally combat Co2 instead of demanding we all repent for our environmental sins and switch to &quot;green technology&quot; which by all accounts is ultimately &quot;saves the sky to spite the earth&quot;. Electronic cars, batteries you think you&#39;re saving the earth you&#39;re just refocusing the damage into the ground.<br /><br />As for destroying our resources....well how about we stop squabbling over meager resources and go out into space mine the asteroid fields or the gas giants for resources? They are in enough abundance to power our entire civilization and species and everything for the next 4000 years and yet we sit here squabbling.....how about we actually focus on going beyond our world instead of just sitting here in fear being bitter towards one-another.

I believe climate change is real, but I also believe the effects that humans have on the environment are not as serious as we perceive them to be.

They can go robbing and killing other people to survive, or they can find other ways. That’s free will. Free will doesn’t mean you’re constrained by a perfect society. In such a society, one can’t practice free will because it’s paradoxical. Although I assume you don’t believe in a God, it seems as though you’re blaming someone for making humans weak and prone to disease. Humans are simply part of the system created by God. They are neither superior nor inferior. All we know about humans is that we exist. What matters from here is how we are going to exist.

The refusal of some of these participants to even entertain being incorrect really upsets me and thoroughly invalidates their arguments. If you are not willing to accept that you don’t know everything, progress will be undoubtedly hindered. Think whatever you want about the technicalities of what is happening with our world’s ecosystems, but please prioritize harm reduction— not being right. Even if you are correct, and the climate is not suffering due to human activity, plants, animals, and humans are dying. Finding ways to help decrease the suffering should be our priority, not whether or not your individual beliefs are correct. I really hope not that you change your mind, but that you change your priorities. Preserving and perpetuating the good and avoiding and defeating the bad is all we as humans can do to make this human experience as positive as possible. Hug a friend, plant a tree, and draw a picture of a polar bear family. There is still good. &lt;3	UCURXWsciHu6B38wNKK9-rvg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCURXWsciHu6B38wNKK9-rvg	0

UgzOYgJ9H6OjxhdJGDx4AaABAg	1	1	2020-03-05 03:52:59	A Person	Other than Jeremy, I think their points were fairly ignorant. Especially when they asked if future generations would have a worse environment. Yes, they won’t be able to experience things in nature that are in danger today or in certain areas would need adapt to the pollution they are surrounded by. They may say the environment is fine, but they haven’t experienced it first hand yet. Also, the polar bear comment just made me sad. I don’t need to elaborate why it’s completely wrong because it’s common sense. The polar ice caps melting? Yeah they do melt naturally but the rate they are melting now is unnatural and caused by us. The data shown in graphs demonstrates that spike of air pollution, so even if you believe climate change isn’t as bad as it is you need to acknowledge that. I agree that economy in some instances is first. If you want an entire country to help the environment it will not help if you give all your money at once. With a strong economy you can help and still support citizens. Preserving nature is not going to help the environment and I think that is just an ignorant point to make. If someone puts you in a cage after destroying your home in order to keep you alive... would that seem fair? Maybe to those who still have their homes but not to you. I understand that some may over exaggerate through their passion of the topic but you need to know that not everyone who is against your opinion is false, untrustworthy, or exaggerated. Plus, your point of view may also have the same issues. You may think 1+1=3 and others give arguments why but then there comes an explanation and other people’s opinions. (I dunno if that was a good example but still). Finally, being stubborn on a topic that is debatable not very wise. If it has not been established as a fact, (although data does show it has), then you should never keep your mind set on one side... ever. If you really want to know your opinion, then you need to try to make an argument for the other side so you know what main points of discussion are for both. I know no one will read this but if by some chance you do... have a nice day :D (or night... morning... idk)	UCxZ3O0DtbyEeSL2ObzHgOBQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxZ3O0DtbyEeSL2ObzHgOBQ	0

Storage is the the problem and will continue to be at scale for a whole grid. People have been spending billions trying to solve the storage problem and have failed. Molten sands didn't work outside of a lab. Freeze storage didn't work outside a lab either. Vanadium reflux batteries have energy density and environmental pollution problems. Which energy storage solution at scale can be used now regardless of geography?

Our neighbors come to us to charge their batteries during blackouts. We produce more energy than we use (include the car). We can crank up the AC on hot, humid days, and the heat on in the winter without conscience or draining our bank accounts.

The absence of a consumer can cause huge ecological issues. Educate yourself on this issue. For example, with wolf populations decreasing, deer populations spiked and overgrazed the land which leads to erosion and loss of soil quality. People care about animals going extinct because it can actually have much bigger consequences	UCgWdYtz4IW2yjIo7jP6C0bw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgWdYtz4IW2yjIo7jP6C0bw	1	UgwYENQK06f2HY81X5d4AaABAg	gabb tothee

People mix climate change and the consequences for humans with animal protection all the time. They are not the same issue. People can care about climate change to protect themselves, but not everyone cares about protecting certain animal species and they don't have to.

We do have the technology to replace it, the problem is changing the infrastructure. We can&#39;t immediately switch over in an instant, but we certainly have the ability with enough funding and man power to switch over an appropriate amount of time. These people sound very reactionist towards extreme leftist news and aren&#39;t actually educated on the real counter arguments. The science is out there to strongly dispute all of their points even if the ambiguity still allows them to make counter arguments. The only one of them with respectable points was the man who wrote a book, but even then, there were clear holes in his logic that came down to believing that humans are somehow better than the environment they live in and so they will transcend it no matter what. We may have the ability to, but without people advocating to preserve the environment these people would not be seeing any chance of an opportunity to overcome said environmental issues.

Sure it can make up a good proportion, but if you want energy out of your socket the whole day, you need a source that is stable and can compensate for the fluctuations because of renewable energy. That's for now fossil fuels, here in Germany, where they make their headless energy change stuff, it will be natural gas (not renewable or "clean" either), because the irrational fear of nuclear is there, because people are brainwashed by media. The newest nuclear power plants are so effective, that even though Uranium isn't renewable, it will be enough for hundreds of years to come, and they are also discovering ways to use the produced waste for energy too with the great effect that it only has to be stored for a few decades until it's safe. I can't take the alarmist seriously until they see nuclear as a good option otherwise they seem to be eco-communists, who try to deindustrialize us and don't take science seriously unless they can twist it and use it as manipulation.

Also we are constantly developing technology to access fossil fuel reserves we couldn’t previously. This could allow time for them to replenish. However if we are looking for another energy source I’d suggest nuclear power as it is far more efficient to solar, wind or hydro.

Catholics also believe that the Pope forgives sin, which is blasphemy. That is 0% Christian. Catholicism came from the Pagan belief system basically calling a truce with Christianity.

Ephesians 2:8-9 “For by grace you have been saved through faith,and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God." Every branch of christianity does something slightly different than others.

Powers who place wealth above humility and the well-being of humanity lack empathy and also fear death because they aren’t in harmonious synchronicity with nature.

I&#39;m all for an open dialogue with climate skeptics (which is why I appreciated their Middle Ground video between climate activists and skeptics), but to present these ideas without providing the opportunity for the other side—the side based on empirical, irrefutable evidence—to counter these claims is irresponsible for a channel of Jubilee&#39;s size and influence. Even more (and I&#39;m echoing other comments I&#39;ve seen), opening the video at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH__Fa2yqnE&amp;t=0m05s">0:05</a> with the phrase &quot;No matter where you stand on this topic...&quot; once again enables, and even validates, climate denialism. Please, Jubilee, release a follow-up video empowering the voices of the scientists who actually study all matters related to the ecological crisis.

Yes, the Earth fluctuates its temperature naturally. However, it does this on LARGE timescales. Additionally, Earth is currently at the stage where it should be heading to an ice age. Unfortunately, we know from scientific data that the average temperature has actually been increasing.<br /><br /><br />2. It would not be &quot;no big deal&quot; if the ice caps melted. Not only would many islands be underwater, but cities at low sea-level, such as Miami, would be underwater.<br /><br /><br />3. Saying that it doesn&#39;t matter if polar bears died because &quot;there are other bears&quot; is not just immoral, but false. The Arctic, along with all other ecosystems, has a complex food web. If polar bears were to go extinct, it would drastically change the population of all other species and case immeasurable harm to the ecosystem.<br /><br /><br />I am absolutely baffled by this. Climate change is not a political debate - it is a fact. I urge all of you to look up the data. This data is taken by non-partisan scientists all over the world, and there is an abundance of it!

They believe in a non hands approach when dealing with climate change and the average citizen&#39;s life.<br />3. They think fossil fuels and industrialization have benefited humanity, and the pros of outweigh the damage to the environment.<br />4. Instead of climate change laws that limit people, they think that making technology more efficient due to capitalist consumer demand will solve the issue.

But it is not the ONLY thing happening, and that is why they are incorrect. All the energy we have either cake from the earth or the sun. That is it. The sun provides a lot more energy, so molecules like carbon dioxide that hold in energy are just going to multiply the effects of the hot cycle of the sun.

The reason it could be so catastrophic is because animals won’t have time to adapt, the polar ice caps melting will release more carbon dioxide that has been contained inside of them for thousands of years, the oceans will warm making them expand and making sea levels rise drastically, and us, you and me and everyone who lives in a first world country and who is contributing to climate change, we will be the last to see the change and the other countries in the world will ha e to pay for what we have done. Disease will become hard to stop because bacteria flourishes at higher temperatures, hurricanes and other weather-related natural disasters will become more powerful due to warmer oceans to feed them, and so much more will happen because people could care to look at the facts.

The change in climate happens over thousands of years, a very slow and gradual change. That is not what we see in today’s change. The temperature is spiking in a matter of a couple of decades. And guess what? The rise in C02 emissions is near to perfectly proportional to the rise in temperature in those last decades.

But what this does is takes away from the possibility of innovation in the renewable energy sector, innovation happens all the time, why continue to work on a system instead of try to improve it? This group of people is open and don’t just believe the status quo-which I like-but that doesn’t mean the other option is always correct...

I’m not saying it isn’t an issue, but it is sometimes blanketed as a statement for other issues that are not climate change related in inappropriate ways. For example the issues Surrounding increased wildfires has more to do with degraded land and poor agricultural and forestry practices rather than being directly being caused by increased global temperatures and global climatic changes. The talks these days are always about fossil fuels and greenhouse gases, but these are only a small sector of issues in comparison to degraded landscapes and unsustainable land use practices that cause changes to all ecosystem and aspects of local water systems. This is where climate activist are failing.	UCMcnCIoyejFx93PcT9K8otQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMcnCIoyejFx93PcT9K8otQ	0

If someone over simplifies and puts everyone of the same demographic (of which these people are not, anyway), then they are name calling, dismissive, arrogant, and purposefully over simplifying. Furthermore, name calling is an ad hominem attack -- a personal attack -- that doesn't address the topic at hand. It's what people resort to when they have nothing intelligent to say. So please explain how I did the same thing? Labeling Diana's thinking as that of a simpleton is clearly an accurate description. She's literally, and purposefully (or perhaps naively) over simplifying and over generalizing the situation. It's actually a sign of low intelligence. I'm not joking. Look up "Dnning-Kruger effect".

They say they are humanists and yet have no concept of this fact. No one is saying natural disasters are caused by climate change, the fact that the intensity, frequency and duration of them is all out of whack is what people are worried about.

Wars over resources, mass migrations of population, resource degradation/depletion, major shifts in markets and supply chains can all be caused or heavily exacerbated by climate change. I do agree that putting a definite number like 12 years isn't useful as you can't predict the timing of natural phenomena.

However, I am 100% willing to change my mind on any position that I hold, no matter how passionately I defend it. I constantly ask myself the question “What if I’m wrong?”. I reevaluate my beliefs, I listen to arguments from every inch of the spectrum. If I find new evidence that directs me to a position that is more moral and more truthful than the position I currently hold, I will follow it. I value the objective good and the objective truth over pridefully believing I’m right in my current beliefs. It is healthy to set aside your ego for a moment and think honestly, “What if I’m wrong?”. Just listening to another side is not enough if you have your mind entirely made up before they get the chance to even open their mouths. Even if you disagree with someone, take a chance and consider what they’re saying. You don’t have to agree with it, but I advise anyone reading this to not live in an echo chamber. Seek out people who disagree with you, and let truthfulness and morality be your guides.<br /><br />That being said, having considered arguments and evidence from both sides, I support climate activism, and I believe humans have a moral obligation to protect the environment.

It is not &quot;skepticism&quot; when there is loads of evidence and a massive scientific consensus in favor of the fact that the world is warming due to human activity. (That would be called denial). All of these people show a lack of even a basic understanding of any kind of ecological science and none of them are qualified to be talking about this issue at all. It is also impossible to take a &quot;humanistic&quot; approach to this issue when these people are putting the very future of humanity at risk with their ignorance and misinformation. It is very dangerous to validate them and spread their misinformation irresponsibly, and I am deeply disappointed with Jubilee.

Reciprocation is definitely a positive trait among animals. Interestingly enough, carnivores are as readily willing to show humans mutual respect as we are for them. Cheetahs, for example, can be relatively safe to raise. A large portion of the animal population I also like or dislike based on their outward appearance. As for natural phenomena, I'm not sure. Most of what I enjoy in nature is ruined by the dangerous animals that lurk within the environments. If I liked the rainforest, I can't go adventuring within it without risking my health due to venomous or otherwise dangerous animals. Artificially safe forests, jungles, arctic areas, etc., would be nice to have in the future. Perhaps through VR.

We rely on nature to the point we need air to breathe and food to eat, none of which nature willingly provides. Oxygen is actually a waste product from plants we evolved to breathe. Humanity survived through hardwork and cooperation with one another. Don't get me wrong, I love that you love nature, and I would keep it around for people like yourself -- but for me personally, if no one really cared about the environment, I would have no vested interest in nature's survival beyond what is contingent for my own.

And that way of thinking is what is ruining this earth. If you pollute the air and water, what will you breath and drink? If you chop down the rainforest what oxgen will you breathe and finally, if you burn fossil fuels and increase the tempreature to such a degree that it will be impossible to grow food, what will you eat??? If species go extinct the balance of the ecosystems will go with them. We cant eat money or material belonging. A consumerist society is a society that will bring this earth to its knees.

I mean, they used to grow GRAPES in Scotland. So of course the climate has always been changing. You know, you people used to call it global cooling, and then global warming... but then you were always wrong, about stuff like your prediction the icecaps would melt in 2018... so you just changed it to Climate change, to make it easier for yourselves. So, any change in the climate, you can froth at the mouth and cry yourselves to sleep over.

Mostly spreading misinformation about polar bears, plastics, and other animals and world activity. That doesn't help, you're making things WORSE. Many endangered species go extinct because safe ones like those you mentioned, and also pandas, get all the money and attention. Conflating poaching with cows farting means people get confused, and leads many of them to waste money on carbon taxing the poor to the point people in Germany have trouble affording power, rather than doing anything helpful in the slightest. And no, you have no control whatsoever, and are naive to think you did. Even in America, popular opinion was found to have no impact on what bills passed, but corporate opinion had extreme effect on what bills passed. And most people are busy trying to survive themselves, with mile-long line at food banks... and you're worried about pangolins at a time like this? There are so many real issues you could be helping with, but instead you spread misinformation to get people to waste their time with non-issues. Probably because the real issues require work, like volunteering at a food bank, or donating enough to help children eat.

Making it MORE illegal...? "That's not natural" Gee, really? Who could've guessed.... Neither is your computer, and it may have illegal gold in it. So what the heck is screaming, "it's not natural," supposed to mean, since you're fine with benefiting from such? If you want to campaign for better mining standards, then that'd be a LOT more useful than all the drivel about polar bear populations that gets pushed in the media, or drinking straws, or just about anything popular in your movement. As it is, I wonder if you're bringing up the mining issue, which is a tiny event in a massive rainforest, to justify the ridiculous aspects of your movement. Because no, you were wrong about the rainforest being less dense, wrong about polar bears, and yes, wrong about pangolins... how is a FARMED animal going to go extinct, exactly? If you want more of them, subsidize pangolin farms. You're all for animals, unless they're bovine? Yeah, let's slay millions of cattle, literally because they chew grass and breathe.... But no, your not eating meat makes no difference, the majority of the world eat it, regardless. It just means you'll get the vitamin deficiencies associated with vegetarianism. Also, you need to fix that head ventilation... I just told you the vast majority of plastic waste is fishing nets... and yet you preach the gospel on how if you avoid sin, by not buying some plastic bottles, this will save the ocean.... Sorry, but industrial plastics, particularly the fishing nets, dwarfs anything you and all the twitter devotees could ever pull off. So you're putting shame and blame on the common people for corporate activity, as your pharisee movement always does.

Look at some of those photos. That is not natural. While there definitely are still some areas of the rainforest that have not yet been affected (like you said, the Amazon is huge), a lot of area is getting affected by humans in a rapid and deadly way. I’m not sure where you get your information about pangolins, but they are definitely endangered. I’ve spoken to conservationists and environmental scientists that have studied them, and they are critically endangered (obviously, because they are the most trafficked mammal on the planet). You also say that living a low-waste lifestyle does nothing. It does. We vote with our dollar. The less people that buy plastic products, the less those products are produced. It’s the same with meat and dairy consumption. Beef is one of the worst things for the environment because deforestation must occur for those factory farms, and so much methane and CO2 is produced as a result of all of those bred cows. By not buying beef, we are telling the producers that we don’t want it. As more and more people do that, it will be produced less and less.

That goes for hunting ducks, too. If you want the loss of no biodiversity, then what are you doing with a computer? Do you know how many rare minerals from around the world that takes to produce? A lot more harm than one gold mine, and some of that harm is, more concerning, to humans. If you don't want to have any impact on any life, that's not possible, and you are NOT doing that. What green practices you follow, not using drinking straws or whatever, make so little difference it's laughable (something like 99% of plastic waste is fishing nets). For all the anxiety over wildlife, it often odes more harm than good. After Cesil the Lion hurt hunting, hundreds of lions were put down, since the hunting preserves couldn't afford to keep them. Many endangered birds are wiped out by wind turbines so ineffective that the German government is ending their subsidies and giving up on them, as of a couple of years ago. And as you demonstrated, all the ignorance about endangered species like the pangolin, which is being farmed in China, waste resources and build up a big fuss over nothing. You seriously need to Cool It.... check out that documentary, as right now you seem like a walking case of anxiety and panic.

I told you their populations are doing well, far better than they have in decades... but you're still spouting propaganda like gospel. Rather than your fear of floods, I think hunting regulations played a far larger role in increasing the number of bears. If you want to preserve pangolins, farm them. That made a huge difference to elephant populations where they tried that strategy. Like most things, the green method is expensive and ineffective. Just got a message from China... apparently pangolins ARE being farmed, and they're not yet in the Threatened category yet.... So, once again, Western hype with no substance, like most of the Green corporate propaganda. You're weeping rivers over a picture of a gold mine? How many tens of thousands of square kilometres is this gold mine, to make a difference? Because the amazon is 5.5 million.... Sounds like photos play your emotions like a violin, but I'm more interested in data. Speaking of which, do you feel any internal draft? Because the fact the Amazon is denser now and more prone to fires just went through both ears. It sounds like you're reading from a 50 year old Gospel, considering you also ranted about polar bears which are doing fine (so are bees, by the way). Predatory species like jaguars don't do so well, because people tend to hunt them... since they don't like predators in their backyard. Same story with electric eels, the locals deal with them when they find them, for good reason.

But their population is vulnerable because of the rising water levels. Their homes are being swept away. I’m just saying there are SO MANY animals that are going extinct because of us. For example, pangolins are the most hunted mammal. They are wanted for their scales, which are said to have “medicinal” properties, but that is just disinformation. They are almost extinct because of us, and they actually help developing countries because they eat invasive bugs. Jaguars are also endangered not only because they are hunted, but because the Amazon Rainforest is not as dense anymore, meaning they don’t have as much protection when they hunt. There is no doubt that the Jaguar population is rapidly decreasing. You can see the scientific research about it. A few years ago, there was only one wild Jaguar left in the United States, and there are only around 15,000 Jaguars left in the wild. Not only because of poaching, but because of the less biodiversity in the rainforest. You can clearly see how illegal gold mining in the past decade has drastically changed the Amazon. If you look at before and after pictures, you will see the one beautiful, snake-like river going through the trees has been destroyed. We are taking so much biodiversity from this planet. You can’t say that no biodiversity was lost because it is clear that deforestation and illegal mining has displaced and killed many plant and animal species.

There's more rainforest now than there was decades ago. Most logging companies also replant, so unless your concern is third world farmers having patches of soil then there's no particular worry. Forests are also a lot denser now, and biodiversity has gone up, probably due to increased CO2 which makes trees healthier. Add to this that the idiots thought there was 1/10th the number of trees there actually are (assuming that's not another underestimate) in 2015... and the hype really starts to deflate. The real issue for animals is that density of the forests... it makes for a major fire hazard, one which the Native Americans kept in check with burning and cutting. The Maya apparently overdid it, since soil erosion is linked to their downfall, and there were so many thousands of cities that I've heard there was less forest under them than there is now (smaller yield per land area doesn't help). As for animals, I already made it clear polar bears are doing fine, and despite that they had you believing a lie that they were dying due to the natural processes of iceburgs (which makes up all those apocalyptic videos that scare kids into having nightmares). Go and check out Cool It, the book or the Documentary, and Bjorn's other work where he found we're many times better investing in child nutrition if we're worried about the future (which is what children from countries in need want, food and medicine, no propaganda that stops them getting fossil fuels to industrialize).

But if we, as humans, cause other species to go extinct, they will change too fast. We are deforesting the rainforest at a rapid speed. So many animals are endangered because of it. The biodiversity will be completely lost. And even if you don’t care about those incredible animals, we get so much from the rainforest (including important medicine), so we should be worried about how fast animals are getting endangered and going extinct.

There's a disturbing amount of projection going on, where you're saying I sold off mistakes as jokes...? What are you even referring to? Are you just in a fantasy land now, where you're part of MENSA, and have many very real friends in your homeschool (also part of MENSA), who would laugh sarcastically at my points? That would be nice, since you can't dispute a thing I said, aside from crying as you beg me for acknowledgement and attention, talking about how you look forward to speaking to me, even staying up until 2AM with nothing better to do, and getting up early in the morning to see me. How utterly [pat hectic]. Bonus: "No need I’m calling me autistic now :)" . . . . That's some next-level cringe, there. What the heck are you even trying to say, in your 3rd grade English?

Thank you for proving what I said earlier. You're not even pretending to be an adult, at this point. Go back to homeschool, Baby Boy. You've made it clear you have the education of a 4th grader, in more ways than one. None of your points have any backing, it's just a constant, "WAAAAH!! My very real friends would be sarcastic about YOU!!" Fit with English so bad you should ask the toddlers for help: "I do understand sarcasm, but if I would be talking to a person who I would let into my closer circle the person wouldn’t have been able to say a single sentence of yours without being sarcastic." Clearly, the homeschooling has not helped you. And of all the irony... weren't you going on about Republican education before?

So, to summarize: You're so emotional that you need to spend that extra time randomly capitalizing letters, writing in a language you barely understand, writing on an iphone, pursuing a conversation that ended a year before you restarted it, you need to write triple post tantrums that often add nothing more than a smiley and a bitter whining jab, and you need to pursue all of this for about a MONTH now. So no, you're not part of MENSA. That, or you're so [pat fetic], MENSA is not an organization worth joining, lest people be associated with children desperate for attention.

English isn’t my mother tongue, so I don’t care of I have 1 single mistake in a couple hundred words, wouldn’t happen to me in German or French. How many languages can you speak? Exactly. I don’t care if you think wRiTiNg LiKe ThIs is cringe cuz it fulfills the purpose. I never said WAAH, that’s republican terminology of which I distance myself. I objectively said that I can prove it to you any time if you’re really that interested. Where did I show any symptoms of Alzheimer’s, I literally didn’t forget anything from this discussion. I still never said WAAH. And yes i do think your childish behaviour is quite entertaining. Im not a troll and im not having a tantrum, it doesn’t become more true the more often you repeat it and I am pretty sure that you know this yourself and are just pretending to really think that cuz if you really do, then just lmao. I am not the one behaving cringy, I am just replying to your random theses. And as I said I am going to stay until the value of entertainment is gone. It rather seems like you have Alzheimer’s since you seem to have forgotten that I said that I am leaving for the discussion but staying for the entertainment. I did read the report on polar bears, you are the one who just read the headline cuz that is your attention span. But seriously, why should I want to have your attention? I don’t know you and i hopefully will never do so. Maybe you can surprise me positively by leaving out WAAH and tantrum in your next comment - warning cRiNgE smiley incoming - :)	UCsFVA__4TcO20So4-2GQTLQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsFVA__4TcO20So4-2GQTLQ	1	UgxgWzeaLLakouABwxl4AaABAg	Sarah Says

Well, at least you were humiliated enough to use paragraphs in your tantrum, this time. How exactly does someone with the equivalent of Alzheimer's get into MENSA? "WAAAH!! I'm just staying because it's FUNNY and i'm enjoying this!!!" Is that why you posted all the smilies before, to show me you were happy? That's exactly what trolls say when they're in a tantrum, to try and lie about the obvious. Same for saying they're going to leave a dozen times, but always coming back to post smilies and cringe. You have been embarrassed by your behaviour many times, and so it's very easy to manipulate you.

Thank you for agreeing with my statements about your intellect. Indeed, you're on the level of the guy who says, "Salute the Marines," because his earpiece told him to do that. The guy who said, "I don't know what I'm signing," but complied when he was told, "sign it anyway." A brainless puppet. Indeed, you agreed you're at the level of Alzheimer's sufferer, someone who responds with, "you know, the thing," when speaking about the bill of rights, who suggested the entire American population died of gun violence several times over with a level of math literacy as bad as your own, and who thought his son was still alive and had gotten into the Senate... he also couldn't tell his granddaughters apart. Largely, Biden's run on sentences and ramblings do match up with your writing style. So I think it's a good comparison. I'd estimate your IQs at somewhere around 80+, barely able to process logical arguments (as evidenced before) and having great difficulty with communication and mathematics (as evidenced before). Hence the preference for platforms like Discord and Zoom, over written communication. Of course, he has the excuse of age... do you have the excuse of youth? Is that why you're so desperate for my acknowledgement, that you're still following me around like a dog? Heck, all this because your English is so bad, you couldn't read the report I referenced, and made a fool and a hypocrite of yourself.

You're not part of MENSA, that was a childish lie, and your writing ability is practically illiterate, as this hilarious attempt at a sentence demonstrates: " but i can imagine very well that it’s not possible to take the content out of the sentence with that not particularly critical grammatical flaw with your level of cognitive capabilities."

The reason because I have no hopes in the USA is because after four years there were still more than 70 million people voting for the same overweight moron as four years before.

Glad you realized how [stew-pid] you were to not bother to look it up while boasting about your hypocrisy and egoism. Now that you were embarrassed by your hypocrisy, and have actually looked it up... problem: The estimates for polar bear populations were about 10,000 or less in the 70s, and now global estimates are at about 26 thousand. You also didn't claim there was any worrying decline in the remaining 11 regions, only saying its stable or better in 7 of them, and you haven't sourced your bogus 38% claim. The Zoologist was pretty clear about it, that the populations are thriving.... "Duur... I never said I'm egoistic! So you're [ill iterate]." *Facepalm* Not being able to interpret sarcasm is EXACTLY a sign of illiteracy. You can't interpret the English language, and have just tried to answer with, "no u," like a child. And yes, nice job boasting about your privilege, being able to afford college while the poor and working class whom you despise cannot. As you demonstrate, it hasn't done you much good.... Studies showed that a large percentage of college graduates couldn't pass the government's standard for literacy, many being below an 8th grade standard. I can dig up the exact number, if you'd like, but it was something like 40 to 60 %. "WAAH! You don't care about the TREEES!" ...*Cringe.* You're seriously virtue signalling about liking trees? Never said I didn't like trees, because it would be cringe-worthy to try and boast about liking them. Even worse to try and insult someone by saying they're not enough of a cultic-tree-hugger. Certainly, it's interesting how you condemn the mainstream global warming movement, and then try to lean on the intelligence of the people who make it up to inflate your ego!

But it’s ok according to studies conservative people are generally less educated, i.e. a higher percentage doesn’t have a college degree or a sufficient high school graduate.

Like changes in the tilt of its axis, north star and proximity to the SUN. The source of all energy in our solar system. Co2 is all encompassing it reflects out as much energy as it reflects in. Earth is a 4.5 billion year old closed loop that self regulates co2 with LIFE. The climate cycles of our planet are continental glaciers with lower sea levels brought on by Global tsunami's. The changes in the tilt of the earths axis, north star and proximity to the SUN causes ClimateChange. Global warming The more the axis of the earth tilts towards the sun. The more DIRECT sunlight the higher latitudes poles receive. Warming the southern hemisphere heat sink oceans and thawing the northern hemisphere frozen co2 continents. Which is why temperature rises first and co2 follows. Cause and effect. Every 13 k years when the Precession of the north star aligns the equator with the solar orbital plane at the ecliptic's. The gravitational pull of the SUN pulls tsunami's around the planet East to west because the planet spins west to east. It happened before it will happen again. Not if but when. The one off with the slow rise of sea levels after the global tsunami's is the Zanclean flood of Noah in the Mediterranean.

This is due to the sheer numbers of each species at each trophic level. Hence, the hypothetical increase in seal populations would first produce a drop in fish species before it could ever increase orca or shark populations. But say, these top predators did overpopulate, they not only consume seals but also fish thus, their prey would still be affected by the loss of polar bears. Everything is interconnected. Your conclusion that humans could just start hunting off seals is assuming the fact that there already is a demanding market for seal products. With the recent cultural shift away from these products, it would be difficult to convince someone to start eating seal meat over fish. Not only that, hunting seals is dangerous and a skill that not many have been trained to do. It's apparent that it's quite easier if we just take the time to protect the polar bears in the first place.

Without them, their food source (seals, there are more, but let's just say seals) would overpopulate, which would lead to a shortage in the lack of fish that seals eat (for example cod and other commercially-valuable fish). Does fish mean anything to you?? Eventually, without polar bears, this ecosystem will just collapse. This is basic science, you should know this from 3rd grade.

So, you're actually putting the reading part of this new comment into question, with your response here :-/ I'm in favour of public transit for economic reasons, such as reducing traffic congestion, and improving urban air quality. Carbon emissions on't cause noticable heating of the Earth, however, and one degree would not be catastrophic even if it did. Rather than spending trillions of dollars on scams to theoretically reduce the temperature by half a degree (using models repeatedly proven faulty,) you would be many, many times better off investing that money into child nutrition, education, and health in poorer countries.

Molten sands is a good example. The tech is proven in the lab. However, there is a difference between a technology existing and a technology being practical and widely deployable. Simple example. In the 1970s computer technology existed and was proven to work in labs and on small scale. Does that mean the technology was widely applicable in 1970 to mass market distribution? No. Another example so you get the point. We have proven that nuclear fusion not fission is possible and we have produced nuclear fusion in scientific studies. Does that mean we are ready to use nuclear fusion on wide scale? No. Do you need more example of technological existing and the difference between that and practical application?

You do know that grids are not connected internationally or even domestically across most regions? Also, the energy storage method you mentioned are not available at scale or are unavailable because of geography in most areas. Hydro storage from dams and pumps cannot be used in flat areas because it requires a grade to pump the water up to store the potential energy and use gravity later. Hydrolysis has not been proven to work at grid scale. All we have right now is that it can be used to power small hydrogen fuel cell cars in small numbers. Battery storage through lithium lacks energy density and longevity which is why we use natural gas plants in areas where we have tons of solar like California. Tidal is not an energy storage method. It is an alternative green source, which like its brethren cannot be relied upon on demand. Power generation is subject to the tides.

That is the problem with all green sources. We cannot control output because you can't choose to flick a switch to turn the sun on or off like you can with coal. You can have enough solar to power your city 3 times over during the day but that all equals squat, nada at night. Storage is therefore the reason we don't rely on green alone and can't.

Maybe its not only the planet, but also the people on this planet that should be saved? About the ozone-layer: did you ever hear about car-companies introducing new filters in their engines? Which reduced the production of radicals greatly. The ozone-"hole" is still there in case you dont know, its just decreasing in size, scientists said it would be closed in 2070.

Do you think the Earth has HIT POINTS, and we are draining them? Even if the crazy climate-worshiping ideas of icecaps melting in the year 2000 (as wrongly predicted by Al Gore) and the ozone layer disappearing about that time were true... we'd still be pretty well off. So what's this idea of no Earth no us? We couldn't destroy the Earth if we TRIED, with nuclear bombs.

Alaskan villages and islands, which have existed for thousands of years, are being completely submerged leaving the natives to find a place to relocate causing overcrowding in villages. The moving or contraction of new villages costs thousands of dollars which no one has or is willing to fund because most live a subsistance lifestyle.

We manipulate the environment in ways that nature never intended and while that isn&#39;t always a negative thing, we have to be cognizant and willing to compromise &quot;progress&quot; in favor of preserving the Earth. Melting of the ice caps aside, kangaroos and koalas didn&#39;t ask for nor know how to cope with us tearing down their habitats to make cities, thus it is our duty to set a line that we cannot cross. I&#39;m not worshiping the earth in a religious way- but it is not ours, we are simply inhabitants with too much power. Also, these people in the video failed to mention that fossil fuels are *a nonrenewable resource*. Even if they weren&#39;t contributing to destruction, we are eventually going to run out and then we will HAVE to make clean energy work. There&#39;s so much about the people in this video that I don&#39;t like at all lol holy cow	UC5nKP7r8Qn90jReFWRJIfbQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5nKP7r8Qn90jReFWRJIfbQ	0

The use of asbestos for fire retardents.... We as a civilization is always looking for a healthier power and helping the live longer. Coal and fossil fuel is not sustainable, hydro, wind, solar energies create more power with minimum risk to the environment and people.

If they said that “ we should do something about the changing climate and its effects, I just dont think carbon emissions are the reason its happening” or “we need to stop destroying the Earth , and switch to clean energy but immediate policy isnt necessary” or ANYTHING along that line, I would have had so much more respect for them. Instead they promote fossil fuels and dont care about the masa extinction of a species and even deny that the climate is changing at all	UCT4_bHbsnTdj724ynSZY4PQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT4_bHbsnTdj724ynSZY4PQ	0

Also, it hasn’t happened therefore it isn’t happening is such flawed logic as actual science can predict phenomena based on existing knowledge. When it comes to matters like this, the choices are clear: accept scientific consensus or get educated properly and attempt to disrupt it. Trust me we would all want climate change to not be a thing, it would be much easier for everyone.

Forests and wetlands provide us with clean water, keep our cities from flooding, and buffer temperature fluctuations. Coral reefs and kelp forests shelter the coasts from intense waves. We rely on the health of many different ecosystems to live the way we do. Not to mention, pollution of the environment can cause major health issues for humans as well. If you mainly care about humans, you must realize we all depend on the health of the natural world. These people seem to forget that based on many of their answers.

The 97% is the consensus of climate scientists who published a peer reviewed papers on the topic (a full survey not a partial survey or something ridiculous like a petition list) and it happens to coincide with the percentage of peer reviewed papers about the topic coming to the same conclusion. You can easily find links to the meta studies with Google scholar. An alternative is to look at the Wikipedia page with the title "Surveys of scientists' views on climate change" Try to ask yourself why you cherry pick your scientist. That is not a viable method in an absolute (or near absolute) science. And it clearly is not a viable method in a science based on statistical analysis.

They say they are informed but their opinions came from a place of protecting their wallets, not actually understanding the issue or how the environment is changing. For example: If the polar ice caps melted, there would be a considerable amount of currently habitable land go in to the ocean. Keeping the ice caps IS in the best interest of human beings, not just polar bears. Saying that children are living in &quot;the best environment possible&quot; dismisses countries suffering great pollution and starvation and only looks at kids in the western world. Why is it that so many people can&#39;t look at things on a global scale? America is not the world, it is a small part of the world and it is benefiting financially off mass production efforts in other countries where it gets to turn a blind eye to devastating pollution in favour of cheap manufacturing costs.

My biggest issue is that there are plenty of instances, of that others have touched already in the comments, about how climate change isn&#39;t going to affect different countries equally. One of the reasons why Hurricane Katrina and the water crisis in Flint, Michigan were as horrid as they were (and are) is because the areas affected were ignored by those who had the resources ($$$) to mitigate the disasters. And due to their blind eye, things got much worse than they needed to be, hence the attention. This is the same criticism people had with Ebola. The countries that aren&#39;t making a super high GDP are going to suffer from climate change, not the people living in the US/Europe.

Look at it this way, what happens if humans were never supposed to live on this plant and somehow we happened to be here. yeah you can make life enjoyable for humans through the plant. But you are talking from a structural stand point like buildings etc.... your not including agricultural, feeding animals with boosters so they can grow bigger, using way more fossil fuels to a point it’s goodto a certain degree, but not at the level we are using it. Letting certain animals go extinct. Ice won’t freeze again the sun is hitting the northern hemisphere harder because of pollution. The impact might be low but it’s due to humans. To saw global warming doesn’t exist is a lie, the real question what will it do to our plant. Now the plant can do thing naturally and cause disasters or what so ever. But we are not a natural thing we are disturbing the natural process the plant goes through. In which way direction it’s process is idk.

The same reason many people died in California from fires.... YOU. Your governments and their policies refused to cut down trees, in fire prevention. So, Australia burnt for almost a year, due to the cluttered trees, and many endangered animals lost their lives. This happened in California as well, in a special community that was meant to be mixed in with nature. Your anti-human policies murder people... and then you use their corpses to advertise your religion of sacrificing humans to the climate.

The interior region used to routinely hit -60c and occasionally -80c for centuries, and no longer goes below -50c. Anchorage in the SouthCentral region of the state hit 90f for the first time in history last Summer, and has been warmer in Winter averages than previously as well. Now only occasionally goes below -20c. Alaska’s only been record highs, and that shows in that a major percentage of wildfires in North America occur in Alaska.

Earth doesn’t care about which part of it you’re on. Maldives may be submerging, but the Appalachian hardwoods are slowly dehydrating from the heat also, and when that gets too far, California and the Rockies will be absolutely nothing compared to the wildfire that’ll happen on the East coast. Australia in North America, but 30 meter trees that burn famously long instead of dry grasses.

Hypolite	yup, being from a small island and witnessing the steady change in the intensity and impact of hurricanes, along with our parents, grandparents, and great grandparents, really makes you realize that the only people who really care about climate change are those directly and immediately affected by it. These people won't care until it affects them but the thing is due to their positions it most likely won't during their lifetimes so they're fine and have nothing to worry about.

In the case of the movie, trufula trees (wildlife/forests) were just a means to an end, which was the thneed. If you're focused on your product and its sales, how far you look into the consequences is encouraged to decrease. The character made the thneeds without thinking about replenishment of the forests. Simple mistake, because it's a movie. In real life we grow wheat, corn, and cattle; and we make sure to keep planting seeds and breeding calves. We are however horrible at collectively realizing that we aren't paying attention to the deforestation (amongst tons of other problems) caused by mass agriculture. This is the point of the movie. Business blinds us. Capitalism/ market economics is not sensible in a world that has the capacity to ruin the lives of ourselves and the wildlife around us. Because that capacity is the trajectory, because those are the rules we follow. Make sense? AMA.

Furthermore there is not just energy, where diversity is - probably- key, but also food....everybody becoming vegetarian or even vegan, wouldn't -as far as I understood it- be better in the end, but cause new (sometime similar) problems.

Ignoring the climate change argument entirely, shouldn&#39;t we be integrating other alternative energy sources to power our society anyway? Once fossil fuels run dry, how will we provide our booming global society with 24/7 energy?	UCnSn3GECUGkqZ7z2qwXacIg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnSn3GECUGkqZ7z2qwXacIg	0

It's funny how idiots rely on crowds and band wagon, instead of arguments. "Duur... an engineer thinks global warming is real... so it is!" So, if I find a Liberal Climate Scientist who doesn't think it's worth pursuing, but that you'd be better off feeding starving children, and he is harassed for his views... surely that debunks your idea. He is Swedish, check out his documentary Cool It where he interviews impoverished Africans who think you should be getting them education and medicine instead of paying people to not have electricity.

Society will change, and if you don't willing to accept a variety of possibilities, you'll be at a loss. People should consider asking themselves should I think about the chance, that might be a slim chance but still a chance? The point is I want to show you how to get people to be mentally ready for the nurture of a healthy environment; if we sitting here thinking this or that doesn't matter, our action will follow. It's easy to forget things that we don't see as a matter to us but matter to others. I just wish that people think it differently, they don't even need to act on that thinking, but it better than "they don't matter".

I think the ideal direction is for developed nations to move towards nuclear energy, with the addition of more green energy and using fossil fuels as necessary. Developing nations are often lacking proper energy infrastructure in the first place, so the goal should be to make green energy more efficient and affordable, or find ways to clean up some of the mess that fossil fuels create.

But going from the Bible, God made the earth and made us to live on his creation and yes we need to protect it. But I also think we as humans can only control so much, we are only capable of so much because we are not Gods ourselves nor do we have the potential to truly stop ice caps and global warming ourselves. I think its going to take a lot more than quitting fossil fuels and getting rid of plastic straws to protect our climate. I'm not saying we shouldn't do anything to help but we as humans can only help so much when we're not in control.

For the temp, maybe it was more warmer in the U.S in the 30s. But were are talking about a small area, in a short period of time. Now, when we talk about climate change, we are talking about a long period of time in a larger area (earth). For Venice, it was probably the same (we can also add the technologic aspect of the prevision). For the Artic and Antarctic, the data said that when is coming to the winter, the ice that melt during the summer have increase a lot, but while in coming in the winter, because the ice who was on the surface have melt a more that the one under the water, the water is lesser salty which made the water a lot more easy the freeze. So in the end, the surface of the antarctic didnt change a lot. But for the artic, its an other story, 50% of the total *surface* have melt. For the other sentence, its an other misintepretation between the climate and the meteo.

A self proclaimed alarmist, Roger Pelke Jr, testified before congress that natural disasters are not getting worse. There are historical records that show the total land area of fires is down in the US and Australia. Historical data shows Venice being dry before in the 40’s and 50’s. The actual, un-tampered data show temps were much warmer in the 30’s in the U.S. Ice cover in both the arctic and Antarctic is slightly above the 1980-2010 average. There was a devastating tornado this week in Nashville. That has killed close to 30 people. There was also a tornado this very same week in 1953 in Texas that killed over 130 people. Have you seen how many trees must be cut down to accommodate even a small solar farm?

We should invest in renewable sources while keeping fossil fuels. Eventually with our investment, renewables will get to a point where we can reduce fossil fuels without much harm, but that is many years away. Just invest in it now, keep fossil fuels, Lower their pollution levels via technology, then when renewables become more efficient, replace.

I do not agree with the green new deal simply because it cost to much when you could get the same affect cheaper if you use newer methods and different strategy that have worked in the pass in other nations. also we can keep pumping oil.. it just should use carbon neutral methods (yes they do excised it is just relatively costly to install... not really because you can use the wast in many different ways and create even more profit but you just got to get it off the ground). <br /><br /><br />Like would you want to go to the doctor and then they say &quot;hey you are likely to get diabetes later in life but you are good now. You could spend $ much to never get it and prevent it by just changing your diet and exercising a little.

Also that gas prices can be influenced by a supply that will run out and our relationship with countries that we dont always get along with. <br />This episode just made me mad.

Regardless of what these people think about &#39;climate change&#39;, I have to imagine that they recognize the reality of pollution (that negatively harms the health of humans), extinction of animals, and many other very real problems that are discussed in relation.

For example, if you in an area vulnerable to hurricanes, you could show warming trends in the atmosphere/ocean that make hurricanes last for longer periods of time at greater magnitudes and the damage they cause to humans/infrastructure. (*Also, make sure to be clear about the distinction between weather and climate.) If someone is arguing with you about the importance of having our polar ice caps, you could talk about permafrost, sea-level rise, and the implications of a wobbly jet stream with a warming Earth. (*Make sure to show the warming trends present-day in comparison with how Earth was way back in the geologic record, especially with how long it used to take to warm and cool compared to the warming now.) When you approach this topic with the argument that the Earth is a series of systems that are all connected (and that climate change does not discriminate!!), I think people are more open to listening.

We should be open to all info and make our decisions based on the research. If there was legitimate abundance of research that says climate change caused by humans is not a thing, then I would believe that. However, that&#39;s not the case and humans have had a massive effect on both local and global environment. There are alternatives to fossil fuels and we need to move away from using them as they&#39;re not an infinite source. The chemical industry is trying to move towards renewable sources and there are plenty of technologies in research currently. My uni degree is always discussing these topics.

Hypolite	@Jeffrey Smith There should be a free public option, and a private option for those able and willing to pay more money for higher quality health care. When i say free healthcare I dont mean the paid option is removed. Just that the person who literally cannot afford it should be able to still get at the very leas the basic care they need to not suffer, die, or go broke/homeless from debt. I don't think college being free takes away its value. I see that as a misconception. I think an educated population gives value to communities, and that there would be less crime, drug use, violence, etc when people are educated. With college the way it is, it's telling people that you either have to be from a well off family, or smart enough to get a scholarship, to be worthy of having a degree, getting higher level education, and bettering your life. The same people we complain about being detriments to society, who knows what they could have done if they had a chance to be educated?

Variable output of large-scale solar energy structures can be minimized a lot just by picking the right locations for solar farms. States like California and Arizona, where weather conditions are pretty optimal for collecting solar energy dont really have too much of a variable collection. As for the money, the US currently subsidizes 20% of coal production and 80% of natural gas, and still, prices for fuel are rising everyday. If we switch tracks and divert a little to solar, the US can become far more energy-efficient.

In fact, Solar Panels are 300 more times more Toxic than Nuclear Waist. So having Solar Panels is the equivalent of having a Giant Tank of Mustard Gas made of Glass, while Wind is a bird blender as it kills thousands of birds each month and even killing important animals like Eagles and Hawks. Even if we take it to consider about the dangers of nuclear it wouldn't be catastrophic as we like to depict Chernobyl as the example of failed Nuclear Energy made by Human Error. The only danger about it's effect is mostly towards humans and not the environment. As you look into it Chernobyl is actually gaining Wild Life than killing it.

Noone is forcing you to reduce your impact. It's an ethical question/restriction after all. Have you thought about where the resources for the TV/car/computer come from? Where does the energy come from? Are they hurting something or someone just so I can have a higher quality of live? What are the consequences of me using these luxuries? Based on questions like these you should find a balance in the impact you make to the Environment. Maybe I don't need meat in every meal. Maybe I don't need the car to go to work every day. Maybe I don't need to go on a trip this Holiday. And if I absolutely need to do all these things i schould search where else i could improve. But changing your lifestyle like that is not easy. It's against human nature. Especially because a LOT of people have to do these changes to make dent in climate change. And the problem probably still wouldn't be fixed. So why should *I* do it? My effort is not going to change anything. This feeling/thought is strengthened by people like you, by basically saying everything you're trying is meaningless. And people like you probably have this feeling aswell. But what if everyone thought like that? Then nothing would change. Which would *NOT* be good. We as individuals can't escape this "Prisoners Dilemma", but we can make other people and especially businesses and politicians (who can make big changes) uncomfortable by protesting, creating negative brand appropriation and things like that. Especially young people who have to live with these consequences in the future should not be ignored or told that they can't change anything. And that's excluding how egotistical it is to say: "We should continue to burn fossil fuels, because it has served us well so far." But *us* is not everyone and everything. Not even Humanity in general. A poor farmer in a small village on the coast in Ghana won't get any benefits from burning fossil fuel. But he will get hit hardest by climate change, while having the smallest impact on the environment. The poor farmer is just an obvious example. In reality the majority of humanity will suffer. And a lot of beautiful nature will be destroyed IRREVERSIBLY.	UCDr6gV7LXUb58G4l4wGTNIQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDr6gV7LXUb58G4l4wGTNIQ	1	UgxWRxUOb5ecJv_aW2d4AaABAg	Payton Jayde

You don't have to implement all of these at once, but if you're genuinely interested in lessening your environmental impact, maybe just try one thing every month: - Bring a reusable bag for groceries. - When choosing a reusable bag, see if you can find a second hand reusable bag, or one that you already have around the house. You can also make one out of extra pillow cases you might have around the house. - Try a meatless day once per week. - Purchase your produce from nearby and local farms. - Buy in season produce. - Use a reusable coffee mug and water bottle. - Carpool, take public transit, cycle, or walk to work a couple times a week if you're driving as a single person in a vehicle. - Plant native species in your garden to support biodiversity in your neighbourhood. - Opt for glass instead of plastic. - Say no to single use plastics. There are a ton more ideas online.	UCX7nInVaiztTv5olfbR38ZA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX7nInVaiztTv5olfbR38ZA	1	UgxWRxUOb5ecJv_aW2d4AaABAg	Payton Jayde

However, since I care about a healthy and sustainable ecosystem, I try to look at all of the negative ways that humans are having a poor impact on the environment and choose to reduce my impact as far as is practicable. I'm not perfect, but that's not the point. It would make a big difference if everyone just started paying more attention to the relationship they have with the environment and ways that they could try to do better. You can start small.

Although we absolutley do track sealife and examine it regularly the operations cant be compared directly. It would almost be like comparing cows to deer and saying we can control cow population thus we can control deer for the same reason, the comparisons arent fully valid but I get the assumption. In some aspect yes, but not to the same extent as deer. And the whole topic is climate and sustainable development thus using an argument that only befalls one species within the sea life category its quite redundant from that perspective, and I get that was sort of the topic in the question but the implication of why the polar bears are going extinct is the root issue. I also have a hard time seeing there would be commercial interest in hunting seals with such regulated boarders. I just dont see there being such a good solution to it. But as I mentioned I think the situation around polar bears does not deserve as much focus as it gets. Common agreements on the topic all indicate melting icecaps are more dangerous for the ecosystem as a whole	UCfBrL-KqlSLJmS_C-JBJLvg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfBrL-KqlSLJmS_C-JBJLvg	1	UgwtFIcuc0M3m-h_NgF4AaABAg	adhochero

Another point is that it is in no way the natural reponse to a change in the foodchain which will have chaining effects on the biosphere. What I did agree on was that just the case of polar bears is exaggerated yes and the dangers of melting the ice caps isnt really from the sea levels rising its more about how it affects the salt levels andnutrition levels in the water and controlling whatever bacteria or microorganisms that lays dormant in the ice. It is completely unknown to us what havoc they might cause on echosystems once released into a new biosphere without any possability for regulation	UCfBrL-KqlSLJmS_C-JBJLvg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfBrL-KqlSLJmS_C-JBJLvg	1	UgwtFIcuc0M3m-h_NgF4AaABAg	adhochero

The problematic part tho is that the extinction of the species is not due to some more apex predator or shortage of food which would be the natural causes for evolution. In this case the effects of climate change has incredible effect on the whole ecosystem in the natural habitance of polar bears. This means that instead of other animals replacing them in the foodchain, the whole foodchain will defacto get radically changed in an extremly small timespan, even 100 years in terms of evolution is extremly fast historicaly looking and we dont know how that will affect the global environment as a whole.

The fires were bad for 2 reasons. 1) Bad legislation: No back burning/controlled fires by local or state government and local councils not removing things that add fuel to the fires such as dead leaves. 2) The fires were largely caused by people (accidental or on purpose) or by nature (lightning). These were why the fires were so severe but i fully agree it was made worse by the temperature being pretty high (in the 40s). If councils did their job we would have saw a major reduction in the fires.	UC1qfarZ3R4lPYgplrak7djA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1qfarZ3R4lPYgplrak7djA	1	UgwtFIcuc0M3m-h_NgF4AaABAg	adhochero

Are you talking about the pollination cycles of bees, for instance? Because we solved that "crisis" ages ago, and often it involves technological means like breeding more and better bees.

Obviously one species becoming extinct from an area won't change the entire planet, but populations of many top level predators and other keystone species in ecosystems all over the world are dwindling fast. With this can come mass destabilization of ecosystems. It's not alarmist, it's a real problem that's relevant to everyone.

The Flu's mortality rate is about 0.1%, whereas Covid19 has a 2 to 5 % fatality rate according to the WHO, and a 0.2% fatality rate specifically for the young and healthy. Also, it is MANY times more infectious than regular flu. So, close to 100,000 deaths in the US alone, from the flu, multiplied by 2, then multiplied by the fact you can get this disease more than once, then multiplied by the greater infection rate.... well, you do the math. It might save your life.	UCvn-M6lYMIT5pV2lIGksshw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvn-M6lYMIT5pV2lIGksshw	1	Ugy6O0FXfunU8v64J6p4AaABAg	Respiir

We’re seeing more green house gases in our air than ever, our oceans are filled with garbage and pollutants and we have nowhere to put them all of these things that we are doing are directly impacting the environment and yes climate. Temperatures are rising. You can’t deny that. Yes one could argue that you need to take a look at history and trends, and the world will probably see another ice age before the end of the world, however, that is because of what we are doing and humans will not survive.

Many pacific islands with very flat geographic areas that sit at a very low sea level are already seeing the rise (for example the Maldives).All the melting of the ice caps would be disastrous towards coastlines, but that is not even the main reasoning to a rise in sea level from climate change. When water gets warmer, it expands. This global scale expansion would rise the sea levels at an even more drastic level, bringing up a much bigger issue.

Just because I chose not to criticize a statement of theirs, doesn’t mean I couldn’t. I just don’t have the interest to go on a lengthy breakdown of their non-arguments, since I have better things to do in my spare time. And based on my one statement alone, you somehow jumped to the conclusion that I just “couldn’t understand a single word they said?” You need to learn how to acquire some deductive reasoning skills, because clearly you don’t have any.

For starters, how could someone be more than 100% wrong? I'll grant that they got the dates wrong, but that was not their entire prediction and as I pointed out many other parts of their prediction have either come true or are clearly trending in that direction. Furthermore, the polar caps in antarctica may have reached new maximums but the NET GAIN when factoring in the north pole is in the red, and that's before you add in the mountains across the globe that have been experiencing snow melt at a rate far quicker then we have ever seen before. I've come across this misconception multiple times before, so I can understand why you think that. It is a crucial distinction. P.S. And if a scientific model is not 100% wrong, that doesn't mean you have to throw the entire model out; especially when there are things they accurately predicted.

Just because many models have been wrong on the dates does not mean that things have not clearly been trending in that direction. Venice has been trying to address the rise in water levels, Kiribati has already began evacuating its population due to sea rise, The net loss of the planets ice is dramatically down when factoring in the North Pole, Polar bears numbers are in steep decline and they are foraging further South than ever and been encroaching on human settlements looking for food because they are starving, and we do have a few gaping holes in the ozone where skin cancer rates have risen. Just because the exact dates were wrong doesn't mean the order of events they predicted wouldn't come true or at the very least move in that direction. When someone tells you the sky is falling you don't need to believe them but when the VAST majority of experts on a topic speak up you should read into the symptoms not just the dates. You can only bury your head in the sand for so long.	UCD2eyYCw-m07EdOM2IRDeVQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD2eyYCw-m07EdOM2IRDeVQ	1	UgyAfGikho659y2b4V94AaABAg	Stella T

If so, I have some good documentaries I can recommend. You should simply look at the history of Global Warming... they have been claiming the world will end for about 80 years now. They said Venice would be uninhabited in 2015, and all the coastal areas would be abandoned. They said that the ice caps would all be gone after the year 2000, Al Gore promised that. Polar Bears are meant to be extinct, and the ozone layer should have been destroyed long ago. So, I think logically we can establish that your experts have been wrong many, many, many times.

If polar bears go extinct, then there will be a rapid increase in seals, which means less fish (because they will eat them all) next minute you have no fish, which means no fish for him to eat.

However some extraordinary floods happened recently and they were also caused by rising sea level and some heavy rain and atmospherical events that can be linked to climate change. There are other "artificial" problems too, of course. But if you add a problem to another it doesn't end well. So, Venice won't sink tomorrow, but there are climate change releted problems that should be addressed with all the others.

We can't afford to lose more trees, planting one doesn't solve the problem either, the wait gap can change everything for humans, and humans can't adapt to no plants and trees, we require them to breathe, the air would be unsuitable for breathing. We would have to have gas masks that filter the little amount of oxygen left in the environment to breathe, now tell me, does that sound like something humans can adapt to? Just remember humans are no different then any other species, all it takes is one blow for all of them to go extinct.

These people should&#39;nt be where they are and it terrifies me that there are people who still believe that climat change isn&#39;t further strengthened by humans. Yes, there is climat change caused by nature but that cycle got pushed together. The last ice age was about 10k years ago and it had a rise of 5°C till today. With the last 100 years it already heated up about 1° C. That&#39;s insane in the big picture and I can&#39;t get my head to it, why they don&#39;t read about these open presented articles and statistics, but they are probably all faked (of course) to bash the bad fossil fuel industry. These poeple should just invest in newer/renewable resources or atomic energy (yes, atomic energy is really efficient and not that much more risky by todays standards, but that&#39;s another topic), but they don&#39;t want to inform themselves on newer topics or investment ideas because everything is good for now and i can get my money, &quot;why do i have to change&quot;. <br />And don&#39;t get me wrong, i don&#39;t think we should all stop to drive cars, planes, boats, etc., use plastic bags or straws. We should just invest more into alternatives, because there&#39;s also a limited amount of fossil resources. And there&#39;s a whole lot money to make in this market either. It will be kinda slow but we should push it.<br />We are humans and we are slow to change, that&#39;s in our nature, we don&#39;t like it, but right here, it&#39;s something we should get a hang on.

The environment was here before us and it will be here after us, but whether we stay long enough to make it to year 3000 I am weary. We will be the very reason for our extermination by not treating the environment in which gives us fruit and in which gives us air, with respect. Whether you are religious or aren’t religious, whether the world was created by science or by a gods hand, we were created to not beat down and pollute the very planet that we have been given because there is no known Earth 2.0, this very planet gives us all of our very needs, and is essential to us. So I do indeed think that Global Warming is an impending issue. This video makes me so very sad. I am a part of the Gen Z generation and I can tell you that this world is not the safest environment it could be. As of now so far in 2020 there has been a wildfire, an earthquake, and now the impending Corona virus and they may argue that global warming had nothing to do with any natural disaster, which no it wasn’t the very cause but it helped in those wildfires and it helped in that earthquake. The world is falling apart. So for these gluttonous adults to say that this is a safe environment for me and for my future generations it’s mockery, and insulting. My grandkids might not even know what a polar bear is. I really do wish that they were could see that fossil fuels arent bottomless and that by switching to solar energy now we would be so much happier, setting ourselves torward a better future. But it’s all about the money these days, and they all want to be in control of what they do even when it is tearing down the world around them because that is human nature. I hope that the younger generation can clean up the boomers mistakes💫 <br /><br />~no hate, only love and my opinion, if you don’t agree then this just might give you something to think about💕	UCdJZkOGgyAyLWp63VK5tmTQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdJZkOGgyAyLWp63VK5tmTQ	0

She sails across the ocean so that doesn’t take up one seat on an airplane. Meanwhile her entire crew of people that she used to sail across the ocean with, were then flown back to their home country. So instead of taking up 1 seat on an airplane she has to take up 15 for her entire crew. <br />Most of these environmental figureheads and policies are more for show than actually saving the environment.<br />Paper straws are proven to be WORSE for the environment, meanwhile Miami is forcing all restaurants to use paper straws. <br />The amount of times you would have to reuse one of those cotton tote bags is about 500,000 times before it’s equivalent to being more environmentally efficient than merely using plastic bags instead. <br />Besides for the hypocrisy of Hollywood where they fly in on there private jets and have outfits made only to be worn once and then proceed to lecture about how they are starting to not eat meat on mondays is disgustingly obnoxious. <br />I’m sure every single privileged person who responds to me in the comments who’s never even known anyone who works in some kind of industry that would be heavily affected by the sanctions that things like the “green new deal” will have a major effect on will say how I’m a climate denier. <br />I repeat I think climate change is real. But 99% of the things we do to stop it don’t actually have a major impact on it. <br />And 99% of people who preach it are buying exclusively organic avacadoes that are being shipped thousands of miles and then driven a couple of hundred more miles. Your organic avacado leaves an environmental footprint hundreds of times larger than my plastic straw. <br />Most of the pollution comes from China and India. Yes America contributes, I agree with that. BUT the impact that we can have on the environment as a whole is so subtle compared to the atrocities created by China and India, it isn’t worth destroying our economy for. <br />Sorry for this long message I just wanted to be clear. <br />If you want to help the environment just buy less stuff. Don’t ever buy a new car, only used ones. Your brand new Tesla is infinitely worse for the environment than and old gas guzzler. If you use plastic, reuse them, even if it’s only 2 or 3 times. <br />If you are bent set on eating only organic. Switch to locally farmed food (and if u live in a big city don’t even bother with organic). Actually do some research on whether or not GMO or organic or vegan is actually having the effect on the environment that u assume it is. In fact GMO technology can one day lead to crops that will be virtually invincible to climate change, but instead we shun the entire group of science with knowing little about it and halt innovation. <br />Don’t buy new clothes. <br />Don’t buy the new iPhone. <br />Don’t take baths.<br />Don’t watch Netflix (yes streaming uses a lot of energy which leads to climate change) <br />Don’t drive (yes talking to you in LA that Uber everywhere but then complain about our warming planet).

The median value of the human contribution to the rise in global average surface temperature is at least 90%. The three major greenhouse gases from human origin contribute to over 100% (median) to the temperature rise (humans are also emitting short lived aerosols which reflect sunlight in the atmosphere and counteract greenhouse gases).

UgxvHN5IYLkYUpscT-94AaABAg	0	1	2020-03-04 23:10:15	TheDoctors Whovian	Climate change is negatively impacting the environment. This is destroying thousands of animals&#39; habitats, leading to their decline in numbers. If numbers get too low then populations struggle to reproduce leading to extinction. Should a species go extinct this can lead to catastrophic effects on the balance of an environment. For instance, the loss of a top predator may lead to a surge in its prey species numbers as there&#39;s no predator to eat them essentially. This increase in prey species numbers leads to them taking over that environment, depriving it of resources that other species also require. Meaning other species decline in numbers as they can&#39;t compete, this results in the extinction of other species all because of the loss of one animal. <br /><br />These people are uniformed about the impact this is having on our environment. This planet does not just belong to humans (which is what their mindset appears to be), there are millions of other species that also inhabit this planet and we have the responsibility to protect the balance of nature as we are the ones that are destroying it. The rate of this destruction occurs so fast animals and plants cannot adapt fast enough to these changes to the climate. Which is why they are suffering...unfortunately.

Let me clarify I'm not suggesting solar power is the best solution or most sustainable etc. of course there's better solutiong like nuclear power which is the way to go right now. Her point was that its impossible for it to replace fossil fuels with solar/wind, and adding context, due to lack of land when we could just continue with fossil fuels. I was countering that yes, theoretically, it is possible, there is land and there's plenty of research attempting to make it a practicality whereas fossil fuels are finite. Doesn't mean I'm advocating solar power solves everything, just pointing some things out.

The dilemma is, countries and regions that can afford to build green energy infrastructures cannot benefit from it on a consistent basis, but those that can, could not afford it. Nuclear power is the best source of power we can harness, it is incredibly dangerous but that's exactly why we need to work on it and improve it.

Even then though all you need is a battery to store excess energy from daylight and they can power 24/7. And even ignoring that, there's already been several innovations in solar tech, like bacteria-powered and graphene-coated panels that still work during fog or downpour. I don't see how this is less sustainable than finite resources, some like oil/natural gas set to run out in about 53 years	UCxX0S6yER7_G995gayIH2Lw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxX0S6yER7_G995gayIH2Lw	1	Ugztjscokbpdh611TF54AaABAg	N/A

On the topic of polar ice caps, our oceans have a continuous system of moving water generated by external forces such as the Coriolis effect, wind, water density, etc.. Ocean circulation is vital in its ability to act as a temperature regulatory system in which ice caps maintain our oceans and atmospheric temperatures to a cooler climate. Although, at today&#39;s rate of Green House Gas emissions, it is becoming increasingly difficult for these caps to continue its regulatory purpose, causing a chain of events typically called &quot;Positive Feedback Loop.&quot;	UCa4bTl9eNMwZBAyBehi6cxA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa4bTl9eNMwZBAyBehi6cxA	0

Of course climate change is an issue but it really isn’t the biggest issue and yes it’s important but shouldn’t be on top of governments lists of things to do. The worst thing is people protesting against things like climate change but not having any kind of solution themselves, they think oh I don’t like it so can you fix it and that hasn’t ever helped anyone. The main issue I think is that we just aren’t using the worlds resources properly I guess.	UCVQi_IQOD0B79hJbcp1w7jQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVQi_IQOD0B79hJbcp1w7jQ	0

If you call out their lies then you are attacked for being a climate change denier. For example, in the U.S., you have politicians that completely disregard nuclear power as a sound transitional technology to climate change, when Europe has implemented it successfully. U.S. politicians are anti-science and use climate as a weapon to benefit themselves and their cohorts financially.	UCSAoSU5tFIynKOqz8IYq6pA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSAoSU5tFIynKOqz8IYq6pA	0

When someone refers to “the earth,” they are usually referring to the plants, animals, bacteria, etc. that also live here. The idea is that humans cannot be so selfish as to ignore the existence of anything other than humans; we have to acknowledge that other things exist. Also, even if we decide that we don’t care about flora or fauna, that would still be condemning the human race into extinction, which seems contradictory to the point that humans are the only thing that matters; that outlook would also harm humans.

This is very harmful to give conspiracy theorists a giant platform to shout from.	UC46kEW7wWTzu4Ldz8z9-szQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC46kEW7wWTzu4Ldz8z9-szQ	0

And what impacts nature eventually impacts us. And the thing with the fossil fuels- those aren’t renewable resources. And yes, while they have led to advancement in society, they have taken a toll on the environment. And to say that we’d end up like some third world country by getting rid of fossil fuels and having more environmental laws?... aren’t many third world countries struggling partly due to an unhealthy environment? And I also hate the argument that some of the climate issues we’ve had are “natural.” While yes, the earth has a history of periods of heating and cooling, humans have accelerated it! And I recall reading that the first fires in Australia were more intense than usual due to climate change. Sigh.	UCgL9wTGy29gVsmEZSgKvIIg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgL9wTGy29gVsmEZSgKvIIg	0

And yet the same humans they’re talking about have populations that are living in garbage chutes, on islands that are getting smaller every year, and forced to leave their homes due to drought or flooding. Not even just impoverished countries are suffering. China, a country with over a billion human beings they claim to love so much, has some of the most toxic air ever. People are forced to inhale smog, and drink contaminated water, but because their suburban homes are air conditioned, and their lawn is green, they don’t care to think about what’s going on past that pretty white picket fence.

There is a difference between being empathetic to a point of view vs. being empathetic to a very harmful point of view.

You cant reuse nuclear energy after you use the energy you have to put the nuclear power source so deep in the ground so it wont affects living creatures.

And yet the same humans they’re talking about have populations that are living in garbage chutes, on islands that are getting smaller every year, and forced to leave their homes due to drought or flooding. Not even just impoverished countries are suffering. China, a country with over a billion human beings they claim to love so much, has some of the most toxic air ever. People are dying because of this, but because their suburban homes are air conditioned, and their lawn is green, they don’t care to think about what’s going on past that pretty white picket fence.

Also, if you think that the ice caps melting doesn’t matter and that islands won’t sink, go to Venice. And lastly, they kept saying they were “pro-human” and that “humans come before the environment” remember that humans are animals. We are part of the environment.

We are the smartest and the most self aware. What separates us from other animals and makes us human, is our humanity. We feel empathy for others, and if we don’t use that empathy to help others, especially animals, who cannot help themselves, then we’re no different from any of the others. Yes it is normal for creatures to die out over time, however the rate and the causes at which they are dying is far from natural, and it is in fact a huge problem.

Change doesn&#39;t happen in a day. <br /><br /><br />This is just like the 2nd Amendment activists saying &quot;They want to take all our guns!&quot; <br />NO... We want better regulations and background checks and firearms to be not as readily available so people who hurt others can&#39;t get them. <br />Also, you should have proper training in a firearm, not just because you feel &quot;unsafe&quot; .<br />BTW the 2nd amendment talks about citizens using firearms to uprising against a tyrannical government, not self defense.

He stated that yes climate changes over time, but what we are seeing today is happening in the span of a few years when it should occur in a span of thousands of years. This sudden change in the environment only occurred since the commencement of the industrial era and the global temperature has continued to increase drastically since then. Try again.

Just because someone is a scientist doesn’t mean their research is automatically valid, nor does it mean they’ve done any research on the matter. As I’ve already stated, look into someone’s facts and research don’t just go with their ideas because they have the title of “scientist”. Not everyone who calls themself a scientist is the unbiased purely fact driven researcher that we believe them to be.

I also believe it&#39;s something that happens naturally - look at past climate changes (small ice ages and warmings). Our weather fluctuates and changes and creates patterns but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s something that should cause panic. <br />I also think we should take care of the world we live in. God told us to. We should be concerned about species of animals going extinct, how much pollution we&#39;re causing, etc. It&#39;s all about balance. Going too far either direction is wrong unless we can prove it. And not even science can prove anything 100%.	UCCGPbUvRaNkckJ8tWT-L6cg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCGPbUvRaNkckJ8tWT-L6cg	0

In the aftermath of Fukushima, people in a 20km radius had to be evacuated. It's perfectly normal for people to not want a nuclear reactor in their city. Nuclear is a good option but it has to be isolated. Nobody wants to take risks. People who support it and think it is irrational to fear it can live near there if they want.

We were created in nature, we weren&#39;t created in the concrete blocks we like to call home. We like to create artificial environments and call these &quot;developed&quot; (all while the mass production tears apart the environment.)<br />The key to helping our environment is to actually have a relationship with it, instead of detaching yourself from it and calling such actions &quot;third world&quot; or &quot;backwards&quot;. And its not that hard to do this. I mean, have you ever wondered why nature walks are so satisfying, or why we have pets, or why farmers market food tastes more wholesome than Walmart food? Because we&#39;ve been built as a part of the environment. Lets act like it.	UCl1GT1P7hYrqtrjIaCy-oBw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl1GT1P7hYrqtrjIaCy-oBw	0

Another one defined himself as skeptic of a lot of things (I get it, you&#39;re probably anti-vaxer and flat-earther).

UgxKh23Ose1l4B_kznp4AaABAg	1	1	2020-03-04 22:17:29	Nadia Alhassani	There have been 5 mass extinction events on Earth, dating way back before humans were alive. These mass extinctions were due to Carbon Dioxide levels (either being to high or too low). Our world revolves around how much greenhouse gases are in the atmosphere because without them, we would freeze, and with to much, we would burn. The mass extinctions have been due to natural disasters (such as a meteor catapulting into the earth and cause volcanos to release tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.) When there is too much carbon dioxide, the ozone layer (which is our protective layer from the outside) begins to decay (as seen by the holes of ozone layer in the Arctic) and a noxious cloud covers the Earth which blocks the Earth from cooling down. When the earth can’t cool down, we are launched into a mass extinction where 99% of the biodiversity of Earth dies and the world becomes a lava pit for many many years until the carbon dioxide levels decrease enough for the Earth to cool. Now to my point... Earth has lived through 5 mass extinctions... humans HAVE NOT, nor will we. We are launching billions of tons of CO2 into the air unlike ever before and have expedited the process of global warming. We are also cutting down so many trees- which suck CO2 out of the air and produce precious O2 (our best solution for global warming)- so now the trees cannot help reduce the CO2 levels. If we continue on this path without making radicle changes to how we live... HUMANS... yes us... we will die. I believe fully that the Earth will survive, but humans will not. If this “humanist” wants to do things for human survival- taking care of the ENVIRONMENT AND THE PLANET is the only way we will be able to survive.

Yes, our weather system can only be measured in terms of hundreds of thousands of years, not in centuries or decades. Checked it out to record there have been 5 Ice Ages has followed by 5 periods of Global Warming which have caused five mass extinction events the killed over 90% of all plant and animal species that have ever existed in Earth&#39;s history. And all of this happened before humans were even evolved enough to migrate Out of Africa into Europe and Asia. <br /><br />Our actual weather cycle a pendulum of extremes. Should we clean our water, soil, and air, yes... but don&#39;t pretend that human activity is contributing to weather extremes that have existed since the formation of Earth.

Since we're able I think we should do what we can here and there, but I would by no means ever tell someone in poverty to stress about trying to go green or anything. It is a shame though how there seems to be a correlation between poverty and negative impact on the environment such as seen with China, since it's much harder to make changes to help the environment in the future when their own people alive today are suffering.

However, most of the people in this video were on the complete opposite end of the spectrum and believe that the environment doesn't matter and all that matters is the economy, whereas I believe there needs to be a balance between allowing economic growth as well as sustaining our environment, since without a stable environment we won't have the resources needed to sustain us.

Food doesn't come from wildlife. The environment is more important than the economy and investing in the envirenment creates jobs and benefits the economy. Hunting for sport should be illegal.

Climate change will prove to be a massive issue in the future. Just because the effects of it have been slow in the past, it does it mean it’ll continue with that pattern.

Renewables aren't yet at a point where they can handle storing energy on mass scales with fluctuating sunlight and wind conditions. So a system based on renewables would have to have something else like fossil fuels as a backup for inconsistent energy production. That's why clean energy in the form of nuclear energy is so important for climate change. That's why fossil fuel companies have been starting to push to integrate themselves with renewables more while diverting attention away from nuclear.

We can Co-exist with nature without destroying it, the MSM can be alarmist but they at least say we should take action, the ice caps matter because of they melt billions will lose their homes even just a couple foot rise in sea levels. All animals are worst saving including the polar bears. There is enough room for renewables and we can live with them. And global warming will lead to problems. Granted the world won’t end in twelve years but we will see more droughts, floods, extreme storms, heat waves, and more.

If you look back a couple of million years to the Permian era. At the end of this era we as a planet have experienced one of the biggest extinction waves in the history of its existance, an approximate 96% of all living things died. The cause? Sea water temperatures rising a few degrees<br /><br />Furthermore while its true the temperature has been fluctuating all across the history in a perfect sine wave, the fact that this sine wave started to deform after the industrial revolution, which shows that we as humankind are disrupting the balance if mother nature.<br /><br />&quot;As long as the earth endures, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night will never cease.&quot; Genesis <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH__Fa2yqnE&amp;t=8m22s">8:22</a> <br /><br /><br />The fact that we in Europe are starting to fail to distinguish the seasons cause spring is starting to feel like summer and winter as autumn. Because we&#39;ve had flowers starting to bloom mid winter because it was springtime temperatures. Points in the direction that Earth isnt going to endure much longer.

The name of Jesus Christ is and if Christ wants me to make sure to include his name you better believe I am going to. The main point is to say it correctly so people actually know what the name is and so they can understand that YES we DO believe in Jesus, and that Mormon is just a nickname that we acquired. So many people think that the two are different religions. I can understand why people wouldn't want to. It is a mouthful for sure but if a person of another religion told me that they wanted me to call their religion by it's full name, I would.

I have many Mormon friends and still I don’t use it and they don’t object. We don’t say United States of America but United States, USA or even US most of the time and out countries name is still shorter. If you want some official version to be mainstream, you have to have a shorter official one. People won’t say a sentence of a name if a word will do. It’s not discrimination or bias against your religion, just psychology and linguistics...

She hardly knew anything about our church and when I told her the official name she said, "That is so interesting! I hope I haven't offended anyone by calling it the Mormon Church." I was so touched by that and assured her that she most likely hadn't offended anyone but that we do prefer to be called by the official name. Yes, saying Mormon is so much easier! I admit that wholeheartedly. But, I have been encouraged by the Prophet to use the full name because I should never leave out Christ's name. If someone is willing to call us by the full name that's great, if not that's fine too. I just want to make sure that a large company like Jubilee would be presenting correct information so that people can be better educated. Oh also forgot to note that several years ago, using the full name was not emphasized as much because everyone was familiar with Mormon but now we are being highly encouraged to do so. So that may have something to do with why your friends didn't mind it however long ago that was.

If forest fires started and massive tornadoes everywhere happened, we are the ones that are screwed. The earth would be damaged for a bit but eventually in hundreds of thousands of years it will regrow and replenish. Humans are unnecessary for the survival of the planet, what we really are fighting for is the survival of humans ON the planet. Like the meteor shower than hit the earth millions of years ago, the earth will recover but will we? The fight is to make sure the earth stays inhabitable for humans. Sorry guys and girls but the planet will not disappear if humans aren&#39;t here and that&#39;s what I don&#39;t think these skeptics get. Yes the earth will be fine, but it will be fine without us on it.	UCaKxfhIeA_9lBnClUfO9kaQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaKxfhIeA_9lBnClUfO9kaQ	0

I don’t think it’s helpful and I worry that’s one of the issues with the internet is everyone gets to say their opinions as facts. It’s like anti vax people - if you let them speak as if their scientist your putting dangerous info out there that kills people. Please be carful about who your listening too. I appreciate the effort and the idea of listening to everyone but keep in mind your uplifting people who have been proven to be scientifically wrong. It’s dangerous.

I do not believe that we must be radical like some environmentalists like Greta believe, but this is exactly the other side of the spectrum. You dont believe in anything. So how you believe the scientific community is wrong if you dont believe in anything. How can you believe that there is no global warming, if you dont believe in any researches since scientists are wrong, how can you be sure your not wrong, where is your evidence that your right and everybody else is wrong. I can be open minded and tell that scientists aren't 100% right, but you firmly believe that your theory is the truth and all the other ones are wrong.

Imagine that scientific minds, who study these things, find out that the Earth goes through temperature cycles. They then discover that this is just an uptrend that naturally occurs. All scientists agree and come to a consensus and apologize for getting everyone all riled up. There are ugly windmills and ugly solar panels, where nature flourished at one time. The country is so far in debt that generations will never recover. The rest if the third world nation's have been burning fuel excessively in hopes of reaching the first world status, so emissions haven't changed much.

It's not that climate change doesn't exist, only the absolute certainty with which people speak. It is still guesswork and spending trillions is short sighted. Near my house there was a great fishing lake, that suddenly grew a bunch of weeds. The government put grass carp in, and they ate all the grass. The carp starved, the small fish lost their cover and died and then the big fish starved. It was a hunch and it failed. There is no proof, one way or another, that climate change is man made.

I just don't understand why you call a hunch thousands of researches while 97% of the scientific community who actually investigates or at least try to investigate the reasons behind these phenomena a hunch. I would be more inclined to believe in that "hunch" than in believing in the opposite which isn't backed by the specialists on that theme. Imagine this, why do you go to a hospital. Because you believe that the doctors, the specialists, know more than you about that disease. That doesn't mean they're right, but they are most likely more right about the causes of your disease than yourself, since you aren't an expert on that field. That also happens here, speculation is not believing that climate change is real, like believing that vaccines aren't supposed to help us or the big bang didn't exist.

Greenhouse gases caused by pollution and excess carbon retention cause heat from the sun to get trapped in our atmosphere at a higher rate than can be recycled by nature. This causes drought, higher global temperatures, erratic weather fluctuations and changes to polar ice caps. These all have varied effects on our environment. Extended drought has led to more forest fires. The change of hot and cool currents clashing have led to more natural disasters like tornados and stronger hurricanes. Ecosystems are dying because key species are going extinct or their environment is being compromised by human behavior. The melted icecaps are decreasing the salinity of the oceans and changing the biodiversity of the ocean and their ecosystems. There are many parts to the issue, not just one.

In this time atmospheric carbon dioxide has increased 260%, as has seawater acidity by 30%, all in strong correlation with each other with proven causal links. The evidence of climate change is undeniable. Yes, we may disagree on how to solve this issue, but scientific consensus is that this is a real, man-made issue with massive consequences if not properly addressed. Many common surgeries have a higher degree of uncertainty over their efficacy and yet the intelligent choice in that circumstance is to choose the surgery with a more promising outcome than no treatment, balancing risks and benefits. This has been done with climate change and it is clear that risks of inaction far outweigh risks of action.

CO2 levels are currently over 400 ppm (parts per million) and that had been 280 ppm or less for the past 2.6 million years ever since the northern hemisphere had glaciation. Glaciation in the northern hemisphere can only happen under 280 ppm of CO2, it will all slowly melt and Greenland alone will cause global sea levels to rise by 6m. If Antarctica melts (which means CO2 exceeds 700 ppm) sea levels will rise by 60m. This creates a positive feedback loop because ice is the best at cooling the planet, it reflects most of the energy from the sun back up out of the planet; melt the snow and ice, you get more water, water absorbs 94% of the sunlight incident on it (sea ice only absorbs 30-50%), therefore the planet heats up, so more ice melts... until you have no ice. The conditions being exacerbated by man-made climate change will make the planet inhospitable for human life	UCOVhotTxY0jJgDhNBkMZN5g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOVhotTxY0jJgDhNBkMZN5g	1	UgzVBa-mjOXTOkmPnTx4AaABAg	Ash Liu

It is the intensity over this short time frame. All but one previous mass extinction events have been associated with quick changes in the climate, however we can explain all those changes in the climate with non human actions, unlike the current events. Fundamentally climate change is a human problem. Biodiversity continues to reestablish after extinction events from a small population of organisms of limited species. The earth will be fine and nature will be fine once humans are extinct (by climate change or not) however humans will not be OK. The climate justice movement is about ensuring quality of life for humans. We could be wrong about this, but would you step on a plane with a 98% chance of crashing (give or take a few %) in the hope that you will be in the 2%?

Now whether these problems stem from climate change or other causes, i think we can all agree that they are too impactful to be ignored.. In my experience people couldn&#39;t care less about these issues unless it affects them directly, and here&#39;s the thing, in the long-term it WILL affect ALL of us. Unless we start dealing with these problems soon they will soon spiral outt of control, affecting us and the generations to come, so get your sh*t together, skeptic or not.

You are right in that the climate is changing and that humans have a effect on it. That said you are wrong about how much we effect it and climate change has been going since before humans even walked the earth for the most part it is a natural cycle affected by everything from the sun to the moon and many things we dont understand and may never understand. There has been a lot of propaganda that says man causes climate change but one thing about propaganda is they will take something truthful on a small scale and twist it to the big scale and leave out anything that dont agree with what they say to the point that any truth it could stand on is crushed under the lies.

Hopefully this year we can implement some other preventative measures that can be performed more frequently.

Even if they didn’t support backburning, they’ve never been a position to implement those supposed policies as they’ve never been in power. Instead, we should start looking at the party that is currently in power and what part they played in the severity of these fires, for example, did you know that the LNP cut 75% (35 million dollars) from the NSW fire services last year?

They are not scientist, they contradict themselves, they say they only care about humans... When all animals go extinct because of climate change (wether caused by humans or by natural climate change), what do they think humans are going to do? Do they really think people made up the stuff about climate change just to gain money, somehow? Seriously, we’re seeing species going extinct every year but all they care about is “humans”. I’m sorry, Jubilee, I don’t think everybody should be given a platform to talk about stuff they heard in “sceptics conventions”. This is a serious topic we’re talking about and I don’t think you want your channel to become a platform for conspiracy theories.

Clean energy is becoming a better investment which I'm very happy about, but a lot of that development has come from research funded by tax dollars. Without that investment, the cost of clean energy wouldn't have dropped so much and we would probably have just carried on with business as usual with fossil fuels for a much longer time before the technology caught up. Because at the end of the day, fossil fuels are profitable, despite how they affect the environment. That's why I think some level of investment at the government level is needed because profits don't always lead to the best outcomes.

Nuclear energy is an incredibly viable option for energy production as an alternative to fossil fuels. However, I dont believe government interference in energy production means is a good idea. The market should decide what is best. The shift to renewables and other cleaner sources of energy is already happening on it's own. Fossil fuels are slowly becoming a worse investment and will die out in due time. But until then we shouldn't take any drastic action as this could cause whole economies to collapse.

The only thing that I could think of that possibly could’ve helped was the replacement of the Clean Power Plan. But he has not really helped the environment. I’m not saying he has! I’m saying CONGRESSIONAL Republicans are trying to do stuff and convince Trump to let them. That’s not hypothetical because they are actually doing those things and if you don’t believe me, go ahead and look them up like I did. And I didn’t say he gave solar panel credits, those were implemented well before today and I think we should expand them. And I don’t think we should give more tax cuts to companies as they already received them. It should be tax breaks for the Middle Class ( and I know that Trump didn’t do a good job with that, but I know a Middle Class family who pays 2,000 dollars less in taxes now ).

But why would you want to regulate the drugs being made, wouldn’t that just prevent future drugs from being worked on.

But I don’t know if you knew this but House Republicans have actually put together a bunch of environmental bills that are going to be introduced in the Spring and they don’t deal with regulation, but advancing renewables and such.

Investing money in the R&D of renewables and pollution lowering tech is one. Providing tax breaks/tax incentives is one too. Regulation can go both ways (there are a lot of bad ones out there, but some are fine). We really don’t need to sacrifice the economy for the environment because we can have both if we implement the right rational/smart policies. And comfort I don’t care about.

In just six hours, the world’s deserts receive more energy from the sun than humankind consumes in a year. Desertec is a project aimed at creating a global renewable energy plan based on the concept of harnessing sustainable power from sites where renewable sources of energy are more abundant. A major part of the project is the construction of a giant solar farm in North Africa which could power the world. Unfortunately, the project has stalled due to political and economic problems, nevertheless the technology exists.	UCLiecS9se0_rvQLg7lguZOA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLiecS9se0_rvQLg7lguZOA	0

God wants to tell you how much He loves you and He wants to help you. He wants you to follow Him and follow the plans that He has for you. He knows what you’re going through and He has the solutions to fix any problems you have. Most importantly Jesus wants to and will save and forgive you of your sins, as well as have a relationship with you. He loves you so very much. “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on him should not perish, but have eternal life.” John <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH__Fa2yqnE&amp;t=3m16s">3:16</a>. God loves us and He has a plan for our lives. He knows everything about us, all our struggles and hurt. “Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations.” - Jeremiah 1:5 You are NOT seeing this message by accident. You are NOT a mistake no matter what anyone tells you. You were born for a reason. God has a purpose for your life even if your life seems like it’s falling apart. God loves you and wants you to be a part of His kingdom. “Therefore repent and be converted, that your sins may be wiped away, that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord.” Acts‬ ‭<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH__Fa2yqnE&amp;t=3m19s">3:19</a>‬ ‭<br /> If you would like to get saved and go to Heaven after you die, all you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ is Lord, that Jesus died on the cross for your sins and that God rose Him up from the dead on the third day. Jesus makes it that easy! He is very forgiving and ONLY wants the best for you now and for eternity. You NEED to turn away from you sinful life and become born again by having a life with Christ and sin no more.<br /> “That if you confess with your mouth, &quot;Jesus is Lord,&quot; and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.” Romans 10: 9-10<br /><br />Please pray the prayer bellow out loud:<br /><br />Dear Heavenly Father,<br /><br />Thank you for awakening me to realize that I need you in my life. Father, I believe that you sent Jesus Christ to earth to preach your word and to be an example for us. I believe that Jesus is Lord. I believe that you loved us (the world) so much that you sent your only begotten son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for our sins so that we may not perish, but have eternal life. I believe that you rose Jesus Christ from the dead on the third day. I believe that Jesus Christ is risen and is seated at the right hand side of God in Heaven. I acknowledge that I am a sinner and I repent of my sins. I forgive those that have done me wrong. I believe that I am forgiven of my sins and have had the price of sin payed for me through Jesus’s death. I believe that Jesus Christ is the ONLY way to Heaven. Thank you for allowing me to understand this. Thank you for loving me. I ask that you come into my life and take control of every single thing. I put my life in your hands and I trust your process. I surrender it all to You. I surrender every part of my life to you. I thank you for saving me and I ask that you come love inside of me and guide me. I ask that You come into my heart and I invite you to be my Lord and Savior. I love you and ask that you allow me to have a strong relationship with You. I ask that You give me a spirit of faith, patience, forgiveness, happiness, and self control. Cover me in your blood, cleanse me of all unrighteousness, and protect me from the devil and his lies. I believe and receive everything that I have prayed for in the precious name of Jesus Christ, Amen.<br /><br /> I believe that you ARE saved. Yes, you are saved the instant you believe that Jesus Christ is Lord and that He died on the cross for your sins and that God rose Him up from the dead on the third day. God loves you so so so much. The angels of the Lord and God are rejoicing that you are saved and have repented of your sins. “In the same way, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.” Luke <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH__Fa2yqnE&amp;t=15m10s">15:10</a>. God bless and God loves you and I love you too❤️. Welcome to the Family of God!❤️ The devil will try to tempt you and lead you far from God. But nevertheless, trust in God. “Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or terrified because of them, for the Lord your God goes with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you.” Deuteronomy 31:6. God will never leave you nor forsake you. The devil knows that God is powerful and loving. But, he doesn’t want you to know that. Regardless, stay strong and tell your self, “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.” Philippians <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH__Fa2yqnE&amp;t=4m13s">4:13</a>. If you have any questions feel free to ask.😊<br /> <br />Repent of your sins daily:<br /> Everyday we sin because we are not perfect. So always repent of your sins by asking Jesus to forgive you of your sins. Also, ask Jesus to come into your life and to help you turn from your sins. Trust God and put him first. Always pray, read the Bible, fast, worship, and believe Jesus died on the Cross for your sins and that He rose on the third day to pay the price for you so that you can live in Eternal Heaven and not perish in hell.<br /><br />Reading the BIBLE:<br /> We should all read the Bible because it is the Word of God and it will be a way to hear God’s voice and direction over everything. I suggest the King James Version Bible. I suggest reading the Gospel of John and the rest of the gospels. Also, I suggest that you download the Bible Youversion app (the brown bible app). They have devotions that you can read everyday on pretty much any topic. I find these helpful as they bring me closer to God and have a lot of amazing lessons that you can learn from. God bless your journey! He is always with you, just pray to Him! God loves you!❤️	UCxt-V0qNi7XvZ2BpHOEPZqg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxt-V0qNi7XvZ2BpHOEPZqg	0

For him to change his mind about that means he would now need to address the moral, religious, and political claims being made that are now false to his foundation of what is true- continuing all the way back to the claims of religion and how we use it as a shroud to disregard things that push our cognitive dissonance. <br /><br />We have the knowledge, understanding, and resources to create an incredibly ecologically diverse and abundant world that ensures everything we need to be happy and thrive as humans on this planet.<br /><br />Look up permaculture or food forests for example.

Not to mention the reason that the ice caps have melted so much recently is because the sudden increase in the global average temperature. This is going to be a problem for many ecosystems and humans, it means that the way of living now is going to change. We should all be worried about this at least for future generations, because the climate is going to change and we have even started to change how we act to try to counter the increase in global temperature and the global destruction of ecosystems.

If polar bears go instinct, so what?&quot; Have you ever heard about the importance of biodiversity? Listen to me quickly. Biodiversity is very important in many aspects (those that have an utilitarian value for humans and those thant don&#39;t have an utilitarian value but are also important) and the most important are the intrinsic aspect which means that if a species goes instinct or a ecosystem disappears we are loosing a very important and valuable thing, the heritable aspect which means that the future generations have the right to enjoy the same biodiversity that we are enjoying now and the potential aspect which means that there are some species, like the Taxus brevifola which is a tree from which is extracted a very important anticancer substance, that are very important for the preservation of human race and that if one of this species went instinct it could cause a masive number of human deaths.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Edit: sorry if there is some grammatical mistake, English is not my mother tongue	UC8ViTDMy7sNyE07G_iGtc2Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8ViTDMy7sNyE07G_iGtc2Q	0

What I what to say is that if a specie becomes extinct due to humans (it can be directly, for example by poaching, or inderectly, for example by the climate change and global warming whish it is scientifically demonstated that it is caused by us humans beings) it is very bad but if it is due to natural conditions is very normal.

The us government has given more tax subsidies to traditional power company in the last 10 year compared to renewable energy sources. I do agree that we are in massive debt right and don't think our obsession with "taxing the rich" is health. We should use a voture system where green companies get votures that then they could sell to non green companies to operate. This will insensitivities companies to go green and also supercharger already green companies so they can Rd more efficient methods. This is a proven method and many countries including the US (look up Tesla's early funding 2007-2013). This is still used in the automotive industry and gave Tesla a extra bump it needed for early development. I also have reservations on our current tax plans and how to tackle it in a efficient and effective way so that it is not regressive in the tax code and does not burn out the population by offering insensitive to the population because traditionally you tax more in good times and then tax less in bad times also providing stimulus to boost the economy.... This has not happened in 30... Oh it is 2020... 40 years. So I think cutting spending and taxing more would not fly in the USA right now. If you want to know my tax idea just shoot a message at me... I gotta go to work and don't have time to explain it right now.	UC5ipnEm4lucS3_IS-JdQqGw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5ipnEm4lucS3_IS-JdQqGw	1	Ugy8MzcIuUVoHy9W-al4AaABAg	Lewis Bricknell

TerraPower maybe with their travelling wave reactors? Still in development, still much more expensive and the same problems mentioned before are still a topic. Especially if you consider that you need thousands of reactors to meet the world demand...now we have 450 worldwide with a lifetime of 20-30 years, we would need 15000 reactors and they all need nuclear fuel which is not endlessly available.

On a side note you also have the added benefit of using the waste (fossil fuel waste) in other industrial capacities. But i do agree that currently containing nuclear waste is easier, just wish we used a different material for nuclear fission with a shorter half life... i know there is one that has a half life around 100 years and is more energy efficient but i am forgetting the name atm. Like your comments and can tell you are well versed in the energy subject. Every time i see something wrong you correct them or hear them out. Keep doing you!!!!

Nuclear fission is mostly done with a rare isotope of uranium so its abundance is rather low. If we would increase the uranium use to a portion that would provide a substantial part of the energy needed in the world the uranium would be mined in mere years. There are other ways to get uranium like seawater processing, but this process is even more expensive and nuclear energy is even now the most expensive form of energy production. Fast breeders could be an answer because these can use more abundant unranium isotopes or even thorium. But the technology is still in development, rather dangerous and one thing is clear...it gets more expensive. Renewable is the way with additional nuclear plants as safety measures.

Solar energy can be used in conjunction with fossil fuels, which is what we're doing here since we have a lot of sunlight in our deserts. So no, it can't replace it.

The existence of it is no longer debatable. Giving people with absolutely no scientific qualifications a platform to spread misinformation is dangerous. Like..... since when was a martial arts teacher qualified to discredit decades of scientific research ..... come on now. Instead of debating whether it’s real or not we should be discussing how we are going to solve the issue. The clock is ticking and we are wasting it arguing about whether climate change is a hoax or not	UCFSDYGqwyimwIp2X8gtA2kg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFSDYGqwyimwIp2X8gtA2kg	0

How do you think we'd fare if you suddenly cut the global energy and polymer production by over 80%? Being a climate nut, whether it be pro-climate change or anti-climate change, will never lead you anywhere. A good first step in the foreseeable future would be to cut down on consumerist culture. Where do you think the Zirconium or the Gold or the countless other natural resources that are used in making your iphone come from? Or what about the 715 gallons of water that go into making your Gucci shirt? Abolishing the use of the largest source of energy and polymer production would cause deaths on a catastrophic scale, cutting down on consumerist tendencies, would not. So a better start to "protesting" climate change is not to go out in front of the US capitol and complain about big energy companies (not to mention the protests themselves create pollution), but to not buy useless things on Black Friday, to mitigate the mindless consumerist culture that plagues society.

Rising sea levels deeming thousands homeless is one thing, but there are many side affects which aren’t looked at, such as the affect it will have on politics when food shortages and refugees increase in numbers. Along with the amount of non-renewable fossil fuels rapidly running out, it is very possible that there will be many more wars to come.

Polar bears mostly live in remote areas with extremely harsh cold weather such as the arctic tundra and do not impact the worlds ecosystem as a whole. The area that polar bears live in is a small fraction of the entire world. How do you suppose that polar bears going extinct would impact the African prairies or the Australian outback thousands of miles away from where any of them inhabit?

It has reached a scientific consensus, that means it should be her really accepted as fact and isn’t up for dispute within the scientific community. Consensus is so strong since scientists spend countless thousands of hours gathering evidence to understand the world around us. There would be such a big reward for overcoming the majority of climate science and publishing a peer-review paper in a trustworthy journal, that is why if scientific consensus is so hard to get because people are literally trying to be the breakout paper that saves the day. So no, there is no room for discussion. The only discussion on the issue should be in how to fix it.

But don&#39;t worry, like the room, the earth will survive. the things living on the earth will have a much harder time. And no, those people don&#39;t need to worry about it, they&#39;re only going to be around for what 15-40years? I&#39;m sure their grandkids feel very differently about their views.<br />On the energy situation, you can of course use green energy alone. The evidence of the environment changing is all over world, and people keep forgetting, the environment changing is bad only for the things on it, the earth couldn&#39;t care less if it&#39;s a wasteland.

Keith is so annoying though saying that fires in Northern California were getting blamed on climate change but in reality it was PG&amp;E (correct me if I’m wrong) but everyone up here knows that. This whole video just made me say OK BOOMER. <b>Also, I will acknowledge the fact that our climate will always be changing.

They don't think the polar ice caps could cause flooding. This is most likely thanks to the Eurocentric world map that makes Antarctica look like a little slither compared to the rest of the world. Antarctica is bigger than North America.

If you wanna measure things objectively to see what's right or wrong and resort to science for instance, I'm afraid most of the battles you think you are fighting for the right side, you are in fact fighting on the opposite side.

Talk to me like I’m an equal and maybe we can have a reasonable debate or you can be rude and never have your ideas challenged and live in your bubble. Your call bro. Makes no difference to me. Citing 2 very small countries that use renewable does not counter my point that solar, wind and hydro are too expensive for what they do compared to nuclear or fossil fuels. Explain to me how the entirety of the world could use renewable energy right now to keep afloat ?? You can’t. I’m not anti renewable energy but right now the only “green” energy that is effective is nuclear. Your point about electricity changing prices by the hour again dosent dispute my point that it’s economically broken.

Iceland runs 100% on renewable energy. Germany runs at almost 40% on renewable energy Solar, Wind, Hydro all make money after some time, and it's getting better and better every year "Canada has to sell their hydropower to the USA at far less then it costs them to make it" Well I don't know if you know this, but the price of electricity fluctuates by the hour, and because hydro also runs at night it will inevitable have to sell at night for a lot less does this mean that it is not viable? no "solar is far too expensive for how well it works" No, solar panels have an average payback time of about 8 years (getting lower every year), and an average life expectancy of 25 years Now I know you clearly are no mathematician, but 25 years is a lot more than 8 years	UCjHU88HRdLBiwkEl1-5gsVQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjHU88HRdLBiwkEl1-5gsVQ	1	Ugyh3uyw4riQPF6-26l4AaABAg	Gregory Schaefer

We could stop harvesting fossil fuels today and we would still have enough for hundreds of years just from what we've already got sitting in barrels.

Im all for expanding research and funding of renewables (especially nuclear) but its ridiculous to attempt to phase out fossil fuels, which is by far the most efficient energy source in the modern era, in the next 10 years (like the Green New Deal wants) if the only substitutes that are being implemented are going to be solar/wind/etc. which are far less efficient (at this point, they continue to advance though). The only energy source that is mildly competitive with fossil fuels is nuclear and, with the progress of research into nuclear fusion (I work in a fusion lab), we could create a worldwide network of energy production with the only byproduct being water. This can only be done if nuclear research gets more funding and support rather than being shouted down by uneducated people that watched Chernobyl and got scared (not saying youre doing this at all).

In case of several prey species, when there is no predator, it leads to interspecific competition and extinction of several prey species. If a prey species goes extinct, then the predator will not have any food and will either evolve or most likely go extinct. And it's not just predator-prey interactions, there's also mutualism- many species are interdependent and sometimes even need each other to complete their life cycles. So yes, it IS a big deal if a species goes extinct. There was a very low extinction rate, which as Aaron lalala has already pointed out, humans have increased it several fold. And that's not good news at all. P.S. - I'm no expert in this subject but most of what I've said is what I learnt in school so🤷	UCCX456dmDZtRc8haMRpjSCA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCX456dmDZtRc8haMRpjSCA	1	UgyxujfexE13oatXwYt4AaABAg	carolyn greenway

While this has happened time to time in the past and everything is ok, it's just naive to think that it would also be ok this time. None of previous animals were as dominant as us, none changed the landscape as heavily as us. While previous species surviving mass extinction could live and thrive in a no man's land today's species would have to somehow challenge us in their environment.

Increasing temperatures caused 1 billion animals to burn in Australia. Polluting our water supply has affected marine line as well as make waters acidic.

It has nothing to do with that. What they’re saying is that they want to continue living in the highest level of comfort that they’ve come to expect. Screw the environment and subsequently, screw future generations. Regardless of whether fossil fuel use will ruin the planet, there will be future generations that will suffer once they run out if we haven’t figured out a better way. So, I must reiterate, they’re being less “human centric” as they put it and more I don’t know, generationally selfish? I’m not sure exactly how one would word it. But I’m getting a real screw everyone but me vibe. Loving that many these people are close to death (60’s/70’s) and have the audacity to act like the opinions those who will inherit the planet don’t matter. 🤦‍♀️ Selfish selfish selfish!

Almost all of the people in the video are true denials they firmly don't believe that climate change is real nor it is happening faster due to human involvement. So i guess the title is right. And i think that it also dismissive when the more skeptical side of the topic, says that all people believing in climate change want that every car and every plane stopped working now. There is stereotypes in both groups..	UCzk6Sap0rzQtF61amDCLJVQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzk6Sap0rzQtF61amDCLJVQ	1	UgxN3P7WqlhCa6wHYmJ4AaABAg	Gregory Schaefer

The current level of CO2 is a bit over 400 ppm, the glaciation in the northern hemisphere can only remain in a stable state when CO2 is below 280 ppm. The Earth had a CO2 level of below 280 ppm from when northern hemisphere glaciation occurred 2.6 million years ago, up to just before the industrial revolution. Human interference puts more CO2 into the atmosphere than can be removed by natural processes.

Sun cycles does have an effect on our climate but the rapid changes we are seeing currently are way to rapid to be linked to solar cycles and too large to be caused by solar activity. At the same time albedo also has a big impact on our planet and since white surfaces reflect more light our melting icecaps can make our climate warmer by not existing and instead being dark blue oceans (which absorbs a lot of light). There have always been changes in our climate yes, but if you look at the climate records changes have never been this fast. And that can be contributed to a raise in co2 emitted. I’m not a scientist so of course be skeptical of what I say that’s what a good science person does but sometimes skepticism steps over the settles science and you shouldn’t be skeptic just for being skeptical .

Sun cycles, movement in earth's magnetic epicenters, reflectivity of the earth's atmosphere are all major factors that cause our climate to change. All those have been confirmed by scientists, yet the media never speaks about them, instead, they cling onto human interference as if that was the only major factor. The terms 'climate change deniers/skeptics' are dismissive terms invented by the media to portray all those who do not fall into their favoured mainstream mindset as insane science-deniers. In reality, nobody is a 'climate denier', and every person with primary education agrees that our climate is gradually changing. What those 'climate deniers' actually deny, are the radical policies pushed forward by the media and people like Thunberg that would be detrimental to global economics. The media keeps screeching about the climate crisis, but have they considered the economic catastrophe their policies such as ban on fossil fuels would lead to? Everybody in that video agrees that pollution is bad and must be combated, they just don't buy into the over-inflated media coverage that is only designed to scare people into consuming more of their services. Examples of dangerous media exaggeration are everywhere, just look at the new Coronavirus outbreak, which many news outlets called the 'plague to end humanity', even though medical professionals unanimously agree that it less dangerous than the common flu. You'd be naive to take any news report at phase value, because no matter what outlet it is, whether its Fox News, CNN, BBC, MSNBC, they all have an agenda to push. The term 'climate deniers' is just a clever way of them painting those with non-radical views as madmen.

Just over a century ago, there were more than 200,000 wild lions living in Africa. Today, there are only about 20,000; lions are extinct in 26 African countries and have vanished from over 95 percent of their historic range. And their p0pulation continues to decrease as the human p0pulation increases. ~ India also has lost vast swathes of forests due to growing p0pulation and urbanisation in recent decades, as a result- Endangered elephants and tigers are killing one person a day in India as humans continue to enroach on the little habitat that these animals have left.

Having more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere means that when the suns energy reflects of the earths surface, when some should reflect back and some should leave the atmosphere, a lot more is retained compared to how it was before the Industrial Revolution. This means that the oceans begin to warm so the the watecycle is disrupted and entire ecosystems like reefs are destroyed, there is an obvious difference between these changes and previous changes and the icecaps melt. Just because you haven't seen the effects of climate change first hand doesn't mean they aren't real. Climate NASA said that there is a higher then 95% chance that climate change is man made however some climate scientists argue its 100%	UCsTtnDAFDBkwqhf1xvgFBGw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsTtnDAFDBkwqhf1xvgFBGw	1	Ugx2Cn0zUqGOnT1ioY14AaABAg	An Egg Salad Sandwich

Most of these guys in the video are basing of their argument on ignorance or lack morality. Dont get me wrong the scientific argument that doubts we can do enough to counteract what is happening without majorly hurting human society is valid, however in this case the debate should be to what extent we should be at least slowing climate change; not whether it's real.

Are you a climate change denier? A neutral scientist? Did you write that just to test how much knowledge I possess? Are you using a scientific approach that tries to find reason in everything by contemplating multiple points of view on a subject? Because I think that the human race has overall increased the velocity of this natural process at an unsustainable pace, and even though we might not be able to stop it, plenty of individuals still make many choices that are unnecessarily harmful to the environment and/or many animal species so we should put some effort into reducing our waste and impact.

These are just immeduate solutions. There likely are way more. But since there are no true short-term effects, people are only starting to care about plastic after 50 years of climate change protests from most countries in the world.

And I guess technically the argument can be made if you look at it from the point of view of FOST (First Order Set Theory), but even then it's not accurate. Also, to add to your point, there aren't an infinite number of planets (at least not in the observable universe). The number may be astronomical (no pun intended), but it's far from infinite.

There are mountains of reliable data that has been building up for decades now showing it. Even in the 50s we were starting to understand that as we pour tons and tons of greenhouse gases into the environment, it holds heat in our atmosphere and can change the world around us. It doesn't matter your religion, political party, or what you heard your grandma say one time, the truth has been out there for too long now for us to pretend it doesn't exist.

I was trying to understand your situation, but you have no point, no data, whatsoever so I can't argue with you. The only argument you have is that this situation is so obvious that i should have known, but I have never heard in my entire life something like immigration is the lead cause of deforestation. Maybe agriculture, mining or housing should be really good answers.	UCzk6Sap0rzQtF61amDCLJVQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzk6Sap0rzQtF61amDCLJVQ	1	UgyB7o97pdzK3WG-hcl4AaABAg	Pavle Ljiljak

Do you think I'm Australian, do I sound Australian to you and therefore I needed to know this about your forests? Because i can assure that where I live, nothing you are saying happens, and I work in the field of conservation of the flora. So, yes of course i want to know but i need a source even a local newspaper if you'd like, because if this is so alarming someone must have written something with some data with that correlation. I'm honestly intrigued and I really want to know more about that. But you need to give me some data, because obviously I don't live in the same country as you.

Do you not pocess eyes? Our media who is complicit in our property bubble needs to publish a piece on this for you to believe what is actually happening here? It really doesn't require much critical thought to realise that when you cut down the habitat of the native animals, that they either die or are displaced. The last bushfires resulted in our remaining local kangaroo mobs being pushed out to the main arterial road to combat the peak hour traffic rather than being burnt, because their habitat is surrounded by and built over by these new housing estates. Unlike you, I don't need a paper to inform me of what is so evident in fromt of me. I will always choose our native animals and environment over immigration. The levels we have in Sydney and Melbourne are unsustainable. You clearly are just an alarmist who, like most alarmists doesn't care about the environment.

Can you give me sources so I can look up this correlation between mass imigration and damage of environment, because I can't talk about what I don't know. That's why I focused on the other point you made, and about that, if you want I can sure give you thousands of articles that prove that the speed of climate change today is a problem, and 97% of the scientific community actually agrees with this. Btw no one is saying that climate didn't change before, you are right, climate has always changed. But the problem is how fast it is changing, environments need to adapt, animals need to adapt, this process takes millions of years. The temperature does not increase this fast without an external cause, like human activity, a mega volcano or a meteorite.

The climate has and always will change. If you can't see how mass immigration and destroying forests effects the environment in a negative way and destroys the habitat for our wildlife, then you are clearly clueless.

Overall the world is getting warmer faster than ever before. There is still cold places in Earth, and there were a lot of hotter years in a lot of places than today. But overall, the average, Earth is warmer than 50 years ago, as it's increasing faster than ever before in this planet history. Btw i don't know why mass imigration needs to be a focus point here.

You talk about the temperatures changing over the last 50 years. I disagree. The temperatures were hotter in the 80's where I live.

Never said that this year is rained less or more than the year before. That is weather. What you are talking about is weather. Climate, in the other hand, is more precise, and it is long term. The temperature in the world is increasing very quickly in the last 50 years, period. Something like this doesn't occurs naturally, only happens thanks to large meteors, mega volcanos and human activities. This leads to the sea rising and the submersion of several islands and archipelagos across the world. That is climate.

I remember hotter days when I was younger. The biggest difference in our city is mass immigration which has resulted in cutting down many of our "supposed to be protected" forests for masses of houses; with no backyards to plant trees and units. These are not compatible with the Australian climate, and are making the suburbs much hotter. Simple solution though. But since the greenies along with our 2 major parties want mass immigration, against the wishes of The People, the environment and our fauna suffers. Governmnent and corporate made problem? Yes. How does giving more money and power to them solve it? Quite simply.. it doesn't, and we will just lose more of our environment due to their policies. Sydney is unrecognisable to what it was even a decade ago.	UCgC2IWeHxDGawXQwZYBui9Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgC2IWeHxDGawXQwZYBui9Q	1	UgyB7o97pdzK3WG-hcl4AaABAg	Pavle Ljiljak

The climate is always changing, but not as quickly and rapidly as today, and you can see that by the simple rise of the temperature globally. This increase is being made at a much higher speed than would be usual on the planet, which means that ecosystems do not have time to evolve.

I think we can all agree that the earth is round, but with your statement and mine, you need to first accept the premise for it to make sense, and here the premise is the basic divergence in ideology, so, again your argument is flawed. Math exists that's a fact, is climate change influenced by humans that's where the controversy is, so you can't just compare a fact with a subject where people disagree.

However I hope to see a development of something even safer but as efficient. The risks are small with nuclear, especially with new technology. However if an accident do occur it’s a huge mess to clean up and it damages all factors of sustainable development. But hey, one thing at the time. I do understand that people find nuclear scary because of the previous accidents. But fact is, it might my one of the most efficient ways to reduce our contribution to global warming. Imagine the difference it would make if both China and the US (as two of the biggest contributors to carbon emissions) completely relied on nuclear. Damn, that would be an amazing step in the right direction.	UCP0pSsMQxqtySMPjct8DCUQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP0pSsMQxqtySMPjct8DCUQ	1	Ugx4TeHJXDFxOvzJvb14AaABAg	S

I agree on everything, but I do however think that the waste might be a bit problematic if hypothetically everyone (the whole world) were to rely on nuclear. However, the development of generation 4 (what ever it is called, my first language isn’t English) is aiming to recycle the waste which would reduce its radioactivity massively. And new ways of storing the waste is also in development which will eventually make it much safer.

This is why I think things like a carbon tax seems smart, and maybe encouraging companies to start developing new electric vehicles, I am a bit biased here, but I do want more funding in scientific research on things like carbon capture and such. But overall, I see your point, climate activists are very now now now, which I don't totally disagree with, but it is unrealistic in some measures.

I also agree that eventually technology will catch up and allow all of these things to be implemented. I just don’t agree that the government should throw the US into horrible debt. We can make changes over time and all people can make individual choices to help it along the way like cut down on plastic/water use, carpool, anything in our individual power. The issue is climate alarmists want to force all of this in a short amount of time under the guise of the climate collapsing in just a couple of decades. This has been what they’ve been saying since the 60s and the day there is a horrible collapse has yet to even come close.

But the global temperatures didn’t just sky rocket over the past years for no reason. If someone have proof of natures carbon emissions suddenly just change naturally by itself and cause this sudden increase of carbon emisiones, feel free to share that. There are a lot of other factors contributing to climate change other than humankind, but humankind do indeed contribute and we shouldn’t look past that. Fact is that we become more and more reliable on energy, and relying on fossil fuels without trying to come up with more environmental friendly options isn’t sustainable.

We need almost every government involved to cut down on fossil fuel usage, meat production (maybe, I'm a bit iffy on that one), plane use, also we need more research and development done for fusion and other climate saving technologies. It'll be hard, but eventually it will happen.	UCf3Zi-OKKzN9PdcwHtWK0Ig	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf3Zi-OKKzN9PdcwHtWK0Ig	1	Ugx4TeHJXDFxOvzJvb14AaABAg	S

The younger generations are just the ones they are targeting with their latest propaganda. And as long as you do not have open debates or discussions with those who oppose or question the latest fear mongering campaign, you will not be aware how this story has been changed over the years or how the people are manipulated to blame other generations who had as little say as your generation in what policies are implemented. If you want to know the truth on any policy being pushed, ask yourself who is it that has the most to gain? Both in power and/or money And by the way... they are not skeptical on climate change. The climate always changes. But whether climate is controlled by the sun or if carbon, which all plants needs for survival, is changing the climate. Pollution is also a very seperate topic.

So it's not just farting cows releasing carbon it is also our burning wildlife? Peehaps you mean flora, I really don't believe our dying animals played a part in what you are saying. You do realise that many of our fires here are as I stated previously, started via lightning strikes. Just like earthquakes, the fires have always occured, well before any Idustrialised period of mankind, therefore cannot be blamed for "man made climate change". It is a myth. Our Native people knew well how to do burns that helped to propagate out flora whilst allowing time for our fauna to escape. But like our local people, our local fire brigades, our Native people have also been ignored. If you want to see why some areas have warmed and others have cooled research tge Pole shift. The poles have shifted, it is well known by anyone who is a gardener or farmer who has seen the changes. The holes in people's theories on climate change on here is alarming. Do we have problems with pollution that we could fix? Yes we do. Screaming for more government and corporate control over the people will not help the Environment, instead it will make it worse. Please wake up to the propaganda that you are being fed, and stop spreading this nonsense. If you want to help the world, start by planting a tree. When you grow gardens and help with fauna, you learn alot about nature. Maybe then you might start to see through the lies being taught to you.

But hey they believe the entire country of Australia was on fire, they clearly will believe and spread any lies. I am an Aussie by the way, and it is green and lush here. We have several varieties of possums in our yard, along with many variety of frogs and reptiles that live in the habitat that we created for them. I wonder what these alarmists do for their local flora and fauna? Screaming lies doesn't help our Environment, only our actions will.

Just like the ones we have here in Southern Europe every summer. The violent earthquakes have existed even before humans were a thing. One I remember well way before pollution was a thing was in my hometown back in 1755, it was pretty devastating and I could give you countless other examples. The ice has been melting for at least over 20,000 years, Europe was completely made of ice and thus inhabitable. Now the same thing is happening to Antarctica. Yes the climate change is real HOWEVER, it's not humanity's fault and the world isn't going to end in 50 years or anytime soon for that matter. What we can do is improve the air quality of our cities so future generations won't have any chronic pulmonary diseases and keep the oceans clean. Because everything else is up to nature to decide.

So your overdramatic alarming statement just shows how much nonsense you believe and spread. We live in a country of drought, fire and flood. Which is worsened by government policies and mass immigration. Local people have been ignored for decades here by our governments imposing green policies on us. We are not allowed to remove highly flammable eucalyptus trees from near our homes to reduce the threat. We cannot even replace them with a safer native tree. Our governnents locked up our National Parks and have allowed the fuel levels to build to these lhigh levels, ignoring advice from tradiotional land owners who have used fire to help the Australian bush thrive for thousands of years. The more fuel, the higher and more intense the fires burnt, which is why it burnt through the canopy. Which is why it was so destructive to our fauna. Our State government also reduced funding to our RFS. But let's not let the real facts get in the way of blaming it on climate change.

The reason it got bad is because they where not prepared enough. Australia did not have control fire burns, cut fire lanes, and let debris pile up over the years. This is why it spread. They also have a lack of man power which is why Americans where sent to help. Also check your spelling and educate yourself.
