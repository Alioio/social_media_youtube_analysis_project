Ugxs3FewHSa54kzlhD14AaABAg	4	105	2019-03-09 18:58:07	Hey_Its_Jo	I&#39;ve been following your work for years now - I believe it&#39;s been about six - and you&#39;re one of the most inspiring people I know. You&#39;re using your platform not only to raise awareness, but also as a way to change the world, to make it better, even a little, and you inspire me, and a ton of others I believe, to take action as well. You make me want to make the world a better place, not only for me, but for the world itself. I want the world to be better so that it can be better. I think that I&#39;d want that nevertheless, with or without having been following your platform, but I think it&#39;d just be wishful thinking, that I wouldn&#39;t have the courage to try and make change if it hadn&#39;t been for you. So I want to thank you for that and also for never giving up on the world and stop fighting for it. We need more people with your mentality and your way of thinking.

Ugy8hAyv-syVXnpyNht4AaABAg	1	20	2019-03-09 23:42:11	xEverlore	This is a really well thought out presentation and was personally eye opening for me. Whenever I bring up the topic of climate change to people (especially of older generations) they push me aside when I say it‚Äôs one of the biggest issues we as humans face today. They‚Äôre more concerned with putting food on the table, or the economy, or their kids. I think what people lack go understand is that those things won‚Äôt matter nearly as much anymore when we‚Äôre globally in a state of crisis the way these smaller countries are already. And people still flat out deny climate change as an issue even with physical proof. I‚Äôm going to direct people to this video now whenever they deny climate change. Thank you!

All I need to do now is find an alternative to yoghurt that I like (soy - yuck!) and an alternative to milk chocolate. I was pleasantly surprised to find the rest of my family are happy to do the same. I think that's the most gratifying part, since they are usually quite stubborn when it comes to change. It might help if you found a tree-planting volunteer group as well sometime. I know it says here on this video that the effect of tree-planting has 'little' effect on the amount of carbon dioxide intake - and that is true, but as trees do have a significant cooling effect locally, so it is still very worthwhile doing.

UgySw9FtN1-VeWKIgpV4AaABAg	7	16	2019-03-09 22:30:13	Darren Bourke	Hey @jackharries , one question. My father is a Dairy farmer in Ireland. His only education is in agriculture and isn‚Äôt in a position to re-educated himself. Often I have heard about questions thrown to him of ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you change to crop agricultural?‚Äù The simple act for him is our land is not viable for any other form of agri. We could plan coniferous trees but that will only earn a few grand a year so not enough to live on. <br />My father has treated animals with respect and they enjoy a long life of an average 15 years on our farm in many cases longer. <br /><br />So what does a guy like my father do? Is there a point where we are placing the importance of animals over the importance of humans? <br />Genuinely would love to hear your point of view. <br /><br />Been a follower for a long time and one thing I‚Äôve always valued from your content is your willingness to tackle real issues like climate change etc. I think it‚Äôs class that you are using your platform so well. <br />Cheers man,<br />Darren	UCQVee5-YaftNGt6mvWh5MHg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQVee5-YaftNGt6mvWh5MHg	0

I believe there will always be a demand for animal products albeit lower than today. A local farm can act as an educational resource and diversify as well as supplying the demand for dairy and meat.

I&#39;ve been a vegan for a couple of years and have always knew of the environmental impacts that animal agriculture had on the planet, but I never searched further in to what state our planet is actually in. I resonated with the point you made regarding why people turn a blind eye, and that&#39;s because it&#39;s easier to not do anything than to actually face the reality. No longer will I be doing that though, I&#39;m intrigued and want to get more involved. <br /><br />Thanks for reaching out to your audience. I&#39;ve been subscribed for around 5/6 years since I was a young teenager and honestly I haven&#39;t watched a video of yours in a long time (I didn&#39;t even realise I was still subscribed), but it&#39;s great of you to share this on your platform.

They just push aside one problem and replace it with a new one as thay use batteries with rare metals that are extracted in terrible conditions, we don&#39;t know how to recycle them which makes them very polluting and the electricity they use is unfortunately not from renewable sources and comes from nuclear or coal exploitation, which is another environmental and human problem seeing how it is extracted. And self-driving cars would be a total environmental disaster because of all the issues above plus the HUGE amount of data it would need - again very bad for the environment because the processing and storage of these data requires A LOT of physical space and energy.<br /><br /><br />I know it is easy to see electric and self-driving cars as a solution to all the issues that come along with oil and petrol but it is not a good one. This doesn&#39;t take away from the quality of your work, I just wanted to point it out because the rest of your speech and action is amazing and will be seen by many people so I just think it would be a shame to spread this idea more. There are a lot of good articles on the subject that will explain it way better than I just did!<br /><br /><br />Anyways sorry for the rant and keep up the good content I have watched your videos and loved them since the very beginning of your channel :)	UCs0K-N5AO6eWU43hVmCjEyQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs0K-N5AO6eWU43hVmCjEyQ	0

Ugx_desJBzBwXx1HfPp4AaABAg	0	16	2019-03-09 21:31:54	Nigel Gresswell	Jack, thank you for calling attention to the issue of global warming and how it may affect us all in the future. You have a great opportunity to reach many other young people of your generation to take action. Just one thing I would say. If your purpose is to promote veganism then promote that. If your purpose is to promote awareness of global warming then do that. But don‚Äôt confuse the two issues. The problem of global warming doesn‚Äôt require everyone on the planet to become vegan! It requires, along with many other measures, for us to reduce our intake of meat and dairy, especially beef. Many vegans may choose not to eat meat or dairy because of what they perceive to be animal rights issues or that eating meat and dairy is immoral. That is an argument which has nothing to do with global warming. So it‚Äôs important in my view not to push veganism (humans have always eaten meat and dairy since humans were humans) as a way to promote it through the backdoor. I think you would also be more successful that way.	UCRnMyvKWoPszLscF4K7pXFg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRnMyvKWoPszLscF4K7pXFg	0

I think it&#39;s very important that this reaches a bigger audience and it could also be used by some teachers who teach English as a foreign language, which is my case. I usually show these videos to my students , so it would be great if we could add subtitles in other languages, like TED talks. Thank you so much for your work!!

The fact that it‚Äôs gotten to this situation and we can still fix it but only for this short moment means legally stopping companies from continuing is the only viable way to approach this.

There&#39;s more cows than people on this island. Maybe this is the main factor of existing more cancers here than in the rest of the country, even the rarest types of cancer. I already cut red meats and dairy from my diet but the majority of the population only eats red meat here and the main source of income of this island is the famous cheese of S√£o Jorge.

No mention of the study on 100 companies being responsible for 71% of global emissions either.... also do you realise the impact of your 3 flights to Greenland, Somalia and Kiribati on the planet üò¨üòï	UCsvEb9Ybdp5_YVdf34ivvdg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsvEb9Ybdp5_YVdf34ivvdg	0

There is problems with polution sure but the real reason will never be discussed because no one wants to hear it.	UCJF5jHj-BH5VCp6B4Nnlq9Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJF5jHj-BH5VCp6B4Nnlq9Q	0

The fact is the earth has been warming and cooling for as long as it&#39;s been here way before man ever arrived! Just check earths history that you were never taught in school!! So if you feel brain washed ? Go with the feeling it is the right one!!	UCL83JjwSCKnH2FtJqeavLBw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL83JjwSCKnH2FtJqeavLBw	0
