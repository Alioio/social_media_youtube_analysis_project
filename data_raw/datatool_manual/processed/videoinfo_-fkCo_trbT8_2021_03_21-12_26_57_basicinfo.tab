title	Did scientists get climate change wrong?
description	Interview with Prof Tim Palmer from the University of Oxford. A recent opinion piece in the New York Times argued that scientists got climate change wrong https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/08/opinion/sunday/science-climate-change.html But did they really? In this video we speak about the uncertainty of climate predictions, tipping points, what we know, what we do not know about the trends, and what policy consequences to draw from that. The mentioned article in the Guardian is here: https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/25/the-real-reason-some-scientists-downplay-the-risks-of-climate-change
