title	Why beef is the worst food for the climate
description	Avoiding high-emission foods can have a bigger climate impact than any other consumption change. Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab Our consumption habits emit billions of tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Our diets account for one-fourth of those emissions. The food we eat emits so many greenhouse emissions because of the land it takes to grow it, but it also has something to do with biology. This video explains why the production of some foods emit more than others, and which foods to avoid to be a more climate-conscious consumer. This video was based on this chart, created by the University of Oxford’s Our World in Data: https://ourworldindata.org/food-choice-vs-eating-local Sources: For more Vox.com coverage of food emissions: https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/2/20/21144017/local-food-carbon-footprint-climate-environment For more of Our World in Data’s data on the emissions related to food production: https://ourworldindata.org/environmental-impacts-of-food A lecture given by Joseph Poore, co-author of the study this chart was based on: https://youtu.be/8miQs3mPGu8 Cow and sheep burping footage: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDjEqYR6CGE https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNrFdrxIToo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgGSqJDzN6o https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9yRdVAmAag https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLJqZknei9I https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPmweCJgvIM https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fHjmPQl8FU Vox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.
