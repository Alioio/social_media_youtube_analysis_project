That&#39;s one day a week that i don&#39;t have to go to work and its a little over 55 miles round trip that I don&#39;t drive my car. I don&#39;t understand why more businesses don&#39;t move to this model. I drive less, still put in 40 hours and I&#39;m happier because I get 3 days off instead of 2. I am already at work so what is another 2 hours to get a day off.	UC3szYlxShEfU74mB-olIGHw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3szYlxShEfU74mB-olIGHw	0

In the country of my boyfriend it&#39;s even worse: there the people don&#39;t even know how bad the situation is, and that there even is such a thing as global warming. If there is one thing that scares me more than the effects of climate change itself it is that: The fact that we hear nearly nothing about it in mainstream media.

Read the animal agriculture white paper by Dr Sailesh Rao . Animal agriculture is responsible for 51℅of global warming on a ten year basis and a whopping 87℅ on an annual basis. This facts have full references and haven't been successfully disputed. Of course we need to do more than go vegan you are correct but unless most of those who can go vegan we are all going extinct sooner rather than later.

If nobody takes self responsibility nothing will ever get better. They could say the same (until country X changes I'm not lifting a finger to save our planet or children) . China has made a policy to reduce their meat consumption by 50% and India has many many vegetarians already because of religious reasons. They have been living with less for a very long time and are following trends in food becoming more like western nations . People who care don't make BS excuses putting the onus on someone else ,they show self responsibility and moral leadership.

If you want to help, stop driving cars, they cause pollution, recycle more... there are tons of stuff that will ACTUALLY help. It’s unhealthy for a lot of people to be vegan/vegetarian. A lot of people have serious health problems where they HAVE to eat meat. Especially if you have Chrons disease, or some other illness that affects your vitamins.

Climate impact is worsening those conditions. It'd be different if these disasters continued as they normally do, but what we're seeing is that their frequency, category/elevation, and radius is increasing. There's also correlative evidence that proves this over decades. You can see that the line that reflects increasing consumptive patterns of resources correspond with their consequential environmental impacts. When there's a huge jump in population or consumption due to industry expansions, we find measurement of greenhouse gases and their negative feedback loops also jump. It's not a coincidence, bc we'd see variations in some of these variables at some point. But their consistent correlation is damning.

Real adults see this and roll the eyes not because they don’t care but because it’s coming out of kids mouths. No one wants to hear gibberish from young humans who haven’t even moved out of their moms house and contribute to society. Sorry but most older folks don’t respect the opinions of babies. Respect is not given it’s earned. Don’t hate the messenger for explaining that life isn’t a Disney movie. Adult issues are adult issues. Sorry we can’t free Willy so easily.

The Green New Deal addresses directly the transition of fossil fuel jobs to clean energy jobs.

Ask any of these climate change activists, simple basic questions about our planets climate and they have no idea. Here are some of the questions I ask them, when they get all high and mighty about it. Try it, it is fun. <br /> <br />1.What greenhouse gas is largest in volume in Earths atmosphere? I have not had 1 person actually be able to answer this question correctly, it is hilarious. <br />Answer = Water Vapor / Clouds (Approx. 95% of all greenhouse gas present in Earths Atmosphere) <br /> <br />2. What is the Milankovitch cycle and how does that effect the Earths climate? <br /> Answer = Eccentricity, Obliquity &amp; Precession effect the average temperature on Earth over long periods of time. Based on real scientific data with accuracy measures in place, this can actually affect Earths temperature by plus or minus 10°C over long periods. <br /> <br /> We are so small us humans, we think we are so big, that is the real climate change issue. If you look up national geographic videos from the 70s &amp; 80s, they were also very concerned with climate change, this was when they had recently confirmed that the Earth had been frozen over multiple times in the past, going back millions of years. They were worried that the Earth would become frozen again. Wouldn&#39;t it be really funny if we actually have to save the planet from being frozen over by pumping millions of tonnes of carbon into the air. The plants would love that....... Not many people know but most plants are actually CO2 deprived and use 3 to 4 times more water in this deprived state. The real issue is pollution and not climate change. Climate change has been occurring for millions of years and will continue to occur for millions of years.	UCMXropKyJHzzaUQIjANRUVQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMXropKyJHzzaUQIjANRUVQ	0
