title	Climate Change: Simple, Serious, Solvable | James Rae | TEDxUniversityofStAndrews
description	In James Rae's dynamic talk he explores climate change, primarily considering how its science is simple, its impacts are serious and the problem itself is solvable. Consequently, encouraging human ingenuity and individual action in order to protect our world. Dr James Rae is a climate scientist in the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University of St Andrews. His research uses the chemistry of sediments, ice, and fossils to reconstruct past climate change. Heâ€™s particularly interested in the drivers of the ice ages, the climates of the dinosaurs, and reconstructing CO2 over geological time. Before coming to St Andrews, James held a prestigious NOAA Climate and Global Change fellowship at Caltech, and studied at the Universities of Bristol and Oxford. In 2015, James won the European Geosciences Union Outstanding Young Scientist Award in Biogeochemistry, for his contributions to understanding past climate change and its causes. When not in his lab in the Purdie Building, you can find him running, surfing, or biking in the Scottish great outdoors, and occasionally playing the bagpipes. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx
