title	Climate change in 60 seconds
description	Climate science explained in 60 seconds by the Royal Society and the US National Academy of Sciences. During the last 200 years, human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels have increased concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere by 40%. If unchecked, continuing emissions will warm up the planet by 2.6°C to 4.8°C by the end of this century. This would have serious implications for human societies and the natural world. This 60-second animation from the world's two leading science academies brings you the science behind climate change.
