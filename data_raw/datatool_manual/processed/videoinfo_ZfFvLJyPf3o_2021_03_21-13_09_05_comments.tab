In a warmer world, the atmosphere will contains lots more water vapor, which at some point will be rain, and will fall on land partially. Some areas might even turn into rain forest, but hard to predict how weather patterns will develop.<br /><br /><br />Oh, Russia and Canada will of course first have to deal will large scale melting of permafrost which will greatly upset geology and ecology in the northern reaches.

Are people from country X who permanently move to country Y still &#39;country X-ian&#39;, or are they &#39;country Y-ian&#39;? I imagine in this type of scenario the UN or relevant organisation will come up with a way that will ensure all of us displaced people will still keep our identity besides personal choice.

Whoops!<br /><br />40 years ago the panic of the day was &quot;acid rain&quot; and that would doom us and dissolve our concrete civilization. Whoops.<br /><br />Al Gore said the polar bears were disappearing... their numbers have been increasing for nearly 5 decades and continue to do so. Whoops!<br /><br />Global Warming is &quot;unprecedented&quot; - Uh, the Vikings farmed in Greenland, Iceland and Nova Scotia until they were driven out by &quot;global cooling and the 500 years of the &quot;Little Ice Age&quot;, which, in 1875, was followed by our current era of warming. Whoops!<br /><br />Hysterical scientists screamed &quot;Antarctic Ice Shelves are Collapsing!&quot; Yup, they always have, it&#39;s a cycle. Lately, Antarctic ice has been expanding. Whoops!<br /><br />The infamous &quot;hockey stick graph&quot; has been shown to be pure nonsense - starting its baseline at the end of 300+ years of Global Cooling!. Whoops!<br /><br />“Current CO2 levels are man caused and higher than ever!” Nope, CO2 levels have been higher than now for the majority of Earth&#39;s past. Whoops!<br /><br />96% of &quot;modern&quot; sea level rise took place before the Crusades.

Think of the dinosaurs era. The sahara desert for example was a forest when the world was hotter, that's because a hotter planet leads to more condensation, rain, and around around the middle areas of the planet.

When we regain the loss of life on an entire continent we will be back to normal. Antarctica use to be alive, not totally frozen. This is our &quot;normal&quot; temperature range. Don&#39;t buy this crap. Temps use to be 80-90 degrees many times throughout history. Worrying if temps will reach 62 degrees seems like a waste of time, resources and thought.

Advancements in solar and wind energy are constantly being made and lots of money is being invested into it. It looks promising! But also theres hydro, geothermal, nuclear etc these options are also attractive alternatives. Ngl, im not the educated one on this topic but u really should look at simon clarks video on emissions visualised he can inform u better than i can and he is a scientist and knows what hes talking about.

Also if we chamge our diet options, to say veganism it can greatly help too. Our usage of technology is small compared to travelling. Electric cars and cycling and car sharing (buses etc) can dramaticaly decrease our emissions. The most we can do at an individual level is spread awareness, pressure governments and hold them accountable and recycle, veganism etc. Dont lose hope! To know better u should watch a guy called simon clark and his video on emissions visualised. Hes an actual climate researcher and provides useful information. Good luck brother!

We had multiple ice ages over thousands years ago and even not that long ago also. There shouldn&#39;t be this much ice and snow on Earth, it&#39;s still leftover from a former ice age. The Earth is getting a little warmer again (it&#39;s always shifting) what is normal. When a volcano erupts there is a million times more polution than millions of car polution. Sinds millions of years ago there have been much more volcano&#39;s and eruptions and the earth has been 10 degrees and even more warmer. All this polution and warmth has went in all these millions of years up through the ozon layer into the universum. We as humans with cars and factories cannot warm up the Earth that much and our polution just escapes through the ozon layer. That we are doing this now in 100 years is complete nonsense.

It&#39;d be nice to know someone could actually predict anything about the future of climate, which does not sound realistic. But this map looks like it&#39;s done by a second grader who thinks that latitudes ONLY are responsible for temperatures.

If the earth actually warmed by 4 degrees, the air would be able to contain much more water, meaning equatorial tropical regions would increase, temperate desserts would also increase, taiga forests would move further north into tundra regions, subtropical regions would become more like monsoon climates, etc.	UC-U01opeePmj44C9v3fvmVw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-U01opeePmj44C9v3fvmVw	0

Plants and ecosystems use the sugar both as an energy source and as the basic building block for growth. carbon free means plant free @t The global average atmospheric carbon dioxide in 2019 was 409.8 parts per million (ppm for short), with a range of uncertainty of plus or minus 0.1 ppm.

If we suddenly started blasting oxygen into the atmosphere, humans wouldn't suddenly become more productive, (obviously not comparable bc we don't go through photosynthesis) but the same concept.

But 4°C on global average temperature level is extreme. It will not happen. The global average temperature has risen 1°C and that alone was already huge. You could also do a video about 10°C more in 50 years. It will just not be real. It&#39;s just a panic story.	UCFEpU8ziAla_iuWupW6unhw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFEpU8ziAla_iuWupW6unhw	0

If we "want" to see the 4°C increase at the end of the century we have to double the warming rate and we have to make up for the smaller rate at the beginning of the century. 4°C is just way to high. We don't have to exaggerate to make a clear statement. Exaggerations only make the real problems become implausible and dilute.

Venus example is not correct, since temperature there us driven by the atmosphere pressure, not by CO2 percentage. What I claim is to give humanity time to develop proper technology. With wind generators and solar panels we do not help the planet and ourselves. I do not close my eyes before the disaster. Though CO2 is one parameter only. Of course we need to control the emissions, but the reasoning may differ. We should not act in panic. This could result to more disaster.

Water cloud is by far more critical for this process. CO2 plays direct role, and we know this direct contribution when doubling. However it is more critical how the whole system responds, mainly driven by HO2. As the new factor due to human activities is CO2 emissions, the rest as called as feedback. It is impossible to calculate this feedback theoretically, unless you enter empirical observation, which differs per area or temperature range in a chaotic way. We are not out of range in terms of absolute values. However we are out of range in terms of how quickly CO2 is added in atmosphere. Biosphere needs to adapt fast, and this is the problem. However this is not the only problem about human activities. Humans we need more and more resources from biosphere. This has a tremendous effect especially in oceans. Fossil fuels helped us increase our population minimizing resources from biosphere. Overall, fossil fuel, considering stable population, help humanity to live in parallel with wild. But the big problem is that fossil fuels helps people to increase population beyond the limits	UCWzIWkwrtc2_omyUyXChQDA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWzIWkwrtc2_omyUyXChQDA	1	Ugz2Ao-ikrz1d-arGiZ4AaABAg	Panagiotis Papa

But only in situations where there is an abundance of other essential nutrients. However, it can be different in the long term. If the extra plant growth causes soil degradation it can cause problems in the long term. When discussing the desertification this is not relevant. For example, there is enough CO2 for plants to grow in the Sahara. All the other things they need are lacking. Increasing temperatures can cause droughts and thus cause desertification.

The more CO2, the easier to preserve moisture, favoring chances for survival. What is critical though, is the severity of change, since this breaks local balance between species. However, as far as I understand overall plant life is favored by increased CO2. Maybe this approach is wrong, and too simplistic. But what I see in my area, is plant life growth, not desertification.

I don&#39;t know if we will do enough to stay below 1.5°C but it&#39;s likely we will do enough to stay below 2°C and certainly enough to stay below 2.5°C. I know 2.5°C is absolutely horrible and I hope we do more to prevent that but I am absolutely certain we will do enough to prevent going above 2.5°C. More and more people are becoming aware of the climate crisis faster and faster, because the more people there are aware the faster the awareness will spread. Environmentalism is almost doubling every year and we only need to have 3.5% of the population doing civil disobedience protests to force governments to tackle the climate crisis effectively. If Extinction Rebellion continues to rise at the current rate (About 0.2% of the population are part of them), they will reach 3.5% in the next 5 years which is just about barely enough to stay below 1.5°C. The temperature I think we are most likely to stay below is 1.7°C or 1.8°C, which is not as good as 1.5°C but good enough that our planet will still be livable - it&#39;s still much better than 2.5°C	UCV4aBBMIKSuMHl_KY-rluiA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV4aBBMIKSuMHl_KY-rluiA	0

Variety is nice - but according tonGates the world will end in 50 to 100 years if we do not reduce green house gases.<br /><br />2: Budget airlines for the last 30 years.Low paid working class people are flying 3 to 5 times a year - and the wealthy are flying 5 to 10 times a year. Business travellers 10 plus times a year for many non essential trips for an expenses paid jolly - for a meeting that could have been held online. <br /><br />3: Powerful 4 litre - 4 wheel drive cars are now the norm. If global warming was real then these cars would be banned full stop / ‘period’ as the Americans say. The green taxes applied do not even prevent a low paid worker having a big flash jeep.Small electric cars would have been subsidised so much we would all have had them. <br /><br />4: Instead the Governments around the world had solar panels subsidies and substantial cash back reward schemes for electricity generated. The rewards were good that the rich filled their farm land with thousands of solar panels and drained the so called green subsidy kitty dry within 2 years - so the schemes were scrapped before the average home owner could install 8 panels on his roof and use some green solar electricity. For 8 panels / 4 kWatts you would get £2000 cash back every year. So a rich person who had 1000 thousand panels installed on land was receiving £2 million for a 25 year scheme.<br /><br />It was free money for the rich. There should have been a limit on the amount of panels someone could install based on their electricity usage. They are not even using the green solar electrify being generated every day. It is a lie that it is fed back in to the national grid. What a scam!! <br /><br />So it is clear that Bill Gates and his UN gang do not believe that global warming is a serious threat within 50 years or they would have changed the above and done even more to influence our individual lifestyle, purchases and carbon emissions.

Permanent hurricanes will form around the tropics. Carbon from the long gone rainforests will accumulate on the ocean and atmosphere, together with unimaginable amounts of methane from melted permafrost and ocean clathrates. Close to the polar regions the lack of sunlight during winter will prevent plant life, as no known species are adapted to live in a warm climate with such long periods of low light. Most probably all boreal forests will be consumed by invasive insect species. The planet will rot and oceans will turn dark brown because of the billion tons of sargassum fed by the dust from the new deserts, as well as from the minerals washed out from the naked soils.<br />Beyond a tipping point temperatures would rise even further, in a positive feedback that could turn our planet 100% uninhabitable. Oceans would evaporate and rocks melt.<br />Don&#39;t believe? Ask a scientist.	UCKFuZ_pRQkNTzNCvc0_YVIA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKFuZ_pRQkNTzNCvc0_YVIA	0

If the majority of ice on the planet melts it will just run to the ocean which will then become rain and it will still fall where it does now. I think a lot of these desert places will just become more tropical. This whole desert scenario is saying that rainfall will decrease which makes no sense.

I know it&#39;s for fun and all but still, it massively wrong on every level.<br />With 4 deg or however hot it becomes, there will be more rain and most of the earth will suffer heavy torrential rain not desertification. Floods and storms will be be worst problem not the deserts. Sure there will be deserts and some land will become deserts, but overwhelming majority of land including present day deserts will experience flooding risk.<br /><br />The problem with climate chage is not desertification but rather unpredictable weather and floods and storms. The simple fact is, hot ocean evaporates faster, and hot atmosphere holds more vapour. So tue future more likely than not is going to be wet and moist.

I know it&#39;s for fun and all but still, it massively wrong on every level.<br />With 4 deg or however hot it becomes, there will be more rain and most of the earth will suffer heavy torrential rain not desertification. Floods and storms will be be worst problem not the deserts. Sure there will be deserts and some land will become deserts, but overwhelming majority of land including present day deserts will experience flooding risk.<br /><br />The problem with climate chage is not desertification but rather unpredictable weather and floods and storms. The simple fact is, hot ocean evaporates faster, and hot atmosphere holds more vapour. So tue future more likely than not is going to be wet and moist.

The humidity on earth would be extremely high and warm moist air would rise from the equator and fall probably farther away than it does today. The rain forests wouldn&#39;t turn to deserts...they&#39;d expand up a bit... lol I do agree that areas like china and middle east and Africa and the US would be mostly screwed without the jet stream, but it&#39;s really hard to tell what that warm ocean water would do near equatorial areas that could get that moisture without geographical boundaries blocking it. <br /><br />Edit: <br />Source: they don&#39;t call it a greenhouse gas because it will suddenly make everything dry...stupid video. These people have obviously never lived in a climate that is extremely humid, e.g. tropical/sub-tropical like Florida or Houston, where it doesn&#39;t require cold fronts to cause rain. Do these people not know what dew points are and how they work with humidity? Do they not understand that the extra moisture rising from the extra hot temps and water would cause massive monsoons and rising moisture columns that cool and fall back to earth near the equator. I am so angry at this misinfo	UC_Ge1PxCB1ScdgICvWmUZMw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_Ge1PxCB1ScdgICvWmUZMw	0

Given aquifer recharge and sensible water restrictions, it will still be inhabitable because of the Great Artesian Basin. <br /><br />Quite literally the largest source of underground freshwater in the world. <br /><br />The guy who drew up this map is not a scientist.

But TBH this is kinda based on strong assumptions, a warmer climate in the northern areas doesn&#39;t automatically open them to agriculture and development. If the available arable land decreased that much, it wouldn&#39;t be appropriate to develop those areas into cities or for agriculture, moreover further development of those areas would only increasingly stress the global climate system--the world won&#39;t just stop warming at 4 degrees, esp if development increases in areas that are currently undeveloped.

But lets say it doesnt, if places like canada and northern europe gets warmer does mean that they will increase that much in farmland, most of sweden and norway is shitty stroney mountains that you cant farm on, canada and greenland are also mostly bare ground where you cant farm so that doesnt help. Millions are going to starve because we cant produce enough food, but of course the amount of refugees are going to collapse countries and our civilisation will have most likely collapsed before we hit 4C which might happen in the end of the century.

Take all those factors into account and no place on earth would be habitable.

It&#39;s about the people in it getting rich off of an ever-expanding, growing, controlling government. It&#39;s all about expanding the government and government control over people. It&#39;s about creating victims. When you successfully turn somebody into a victim, you have automatically made them a dependent on you. You are essentially telling them they have lost the power necessary to solve their own problems. And you create within them a mentality that they can&#39;t overcome their own problem because they&#39;re victims.	UC0gztQzyAwhvjFk63-brXUg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0gztQzyAwhvjFk63-brXUg	0

Do you really think the people of the world, e.g., the USA or China or lower Europe, could care less what Denmark has to say about immigration. There will be the greatest physical migration of people in world history, literally millions of people will migrate or die! To think that this will somehow all honor current national boundaries and current governments in green areas is very absurd. This would be the flight of millions, if not billions of people to green land, and Denmark or Russia or Canada would not be asked to open up its immigration policies. Desperate people would take what they want like locusts. And the USA has enough weapons to destroy any government power that might try to stand in the way. This may be the most bloody period in human history. I am glad I won&#39;t live to see it.	UCUYVebZHB473WODQgocJTJQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUYVebZHB473WODQgocJTJQ	0

This behavior has been repeated for thousands of years, and will continue to repeat itself, this means that it is cyclical, it does not depend on the action of man, emission of carbon, carbon oxide, cows, etc. the action of this component is insignificant.

Much of Norway will be land even after 50meter ocean rise, Denmark will be flooded, though, except for some small islands. But the modern way of living is city-living, and those could (or would) be built on the new shorelines. Much cultural value would be saved, and another lot be lost. The worst danger, as far as I can see, is panics.<br /><br />In South America The Andes will be over sea-level and will still attract rain. Amazonas will disappear or rather, some of it move upwards into the Andes-areas. So the map of this video is perhaps a little wrong here and there.

Deserts mainly exist due to a lack of water! Temperature may play a role but access to water is much more important. The idea that a higher temperature causes the size of desert to increase is fallacious. There will be more circulating water in a world with higher temperature (melting poles, more water vaporizes). More water will reach the central parts of northern africa and australia! The size of the sahara desert will shrink due to an increase in vegetation at the cost areas.<br />2. Global warming means that the average (!) temperature will rise, not that the temperature at every single point of the world will rise. The greenhouse effect will have little to no effect on areas where the sun already shines perpendicularly.	UC-tLhyKDv8PrYwsslP9NTuw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-tLhyKDv8PrYwsslP9NTuw	0

Maybe just maybe if we acted right and rebuilt society and industry sustainably and let nature heal itself we could return when earth&#39;s climate shifted again. If civilization is going to last another 10000 years I&#39;m positive we are going to have to shift population densities several times across the globe.

You can move it around, you can make spring floods and summer drought an area&#39;s new norm, you can really mess things up. But &quot;sweeping deserts across the world&quot; is a biased and simplistic &quot;conclusion&quot;. As if dinosaurs lived in continent-spanning deserts.<br /><br />And all that &quot;farmland&quot; opening up? Sure, the Canadian Shield will warm up, but you&#39;ll need dynamite to prepare your field for planting. Of course, you could truck a few feet of Nebraska north (good luck with that).<br /><br /><br />Take a look at pictures of ice-free areas of Antarctica. Rock and rocks, with some gravel. Warm it up and how many farmers will clamor for the field? Lots, but only after hundreds or thousands of years as nature builds up some soil.<br /><br />Siberia? Maybe. Bogs and mosquitos and Putin&#39;s legacy, which surely won&#39;t be fun. But there will be excitement, what with the random explosions as permafrost melts and microbes make methane, building a pressure bubble underground until things go BOOM. Of course, unstable land that&#39;s shifting as its underlying permafrost melts over decades to centuries is a bugger to build on. Alaskan roads, buildings, pipelines, and even trees are destabilizing. Look up &quot;Drunken forest&quot;	UCh_glujen8ADGvFmSdnjR3w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh_glujen8ADGvFmSdnjR3w	0

The exception would be Europe which would be colder and drier due to the Gulf stream slowing down.	UCMXJLI2JrC60UH_ObZyZxzg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMXJLI2JrC60UH_ObZyZxzg	0

Did you know here in wisconsin we found tropical fish fossils? and that some places are still today getting record cold temperatures. did you think that maybe the Earth&#39;s axis changes in time, in hundreds or even thousands of years. there is no global warming. Some places are getting hotter snd some places are getting colder. the earth shifts and changes through time. animals leave their places and go somewhere colder. until the earth changes back again. then they go back. as the world turns slowly it changes and it might take hundreds or thousands of years, but it does. if global warning was real, places wouldn&#39;t be getting colder while others are getting warmer. florida i&#39;m sure will be full of snow and cold temperatures while alaska is tropical again in time. The DNA is proof that sometime between 450,000 and 800,000 years ago, much of Greenland was especially green and covered in a boreal forest that was home to alder, spruce and pine trees, as well as insects such as butterflies and beetles.

Deserts expand during Ice Ages; the warmer the planet, the wetter it is, as warm air can hold more moisture and more moisture is evaporated from the seas (duh hurricanes). Just because it gets hotter doesn’t mean that deserts start forming, this is the most basic historical meteorology that shows that the guy who wrote this book did hardly any research.

What this also means is that where rain is more likely to fall it will absolutely 'bucket down'! causing massive flooding, coastal erosion and landslides. And then there IS that problem of Hurricanes, globally the likely hood of them has already increased as has their severity @ only 1 degree at present, I suspect that if we get to 4 degree warming we might see them forming not only at the Equatorial line but possibly at the Tropics of Capricorn and Cancer as well. Maybe that would bring some rain to desert lands who knows. I'm no scientist but I don't think much of your logic either!

Does oil and coal pollute you bet. It is way too expensive, we need a technology that gives us a Car that costs one dollar to go 500 miles, and is 5 minutes to charge back up. Problem One is that batteries will never do it. We need super capacitors. It can only happen with room temperature super conduction, Graphene doped with silver and boron. Then you need nuclear LFTRs to provide the 70% increase demand load on the grid. More than enough Thorium to last 5000 years until you perfect fusion, which the Ocean has a 1000000 year supply but look to the comets for more. Science people did you know that the CO2 levels were 10000 parts per million and the Earth was a big Ice Ball frozen at the Equator! What do you think the Limestone and marble is made out off? 4000 years ago how many grass eaters just in North America were putting out methane? Try 4.5billion, one herd of buffalo covered an entire state alone not to mention the deer, wild Rams etc. Number one polluter in the world is big agro. 50% of diesel goes into growing are food. Not to mention the energy that it takes to transport and refrigerate. We need 100 times more power clean and safe at 1/30 the cost. Yup we are almost there but the Elites of the world do not want that. 80% of the taxes paid all over the world are energy related. Governments make more money on oil than the oil companies do, and have no liabilities, that the oil companies do. Cheap clean energy is freedom. 23% of the cost of any product is energy, more or less. Solar and wind are energy transfers. Never get the power back that went into making them for solar unless used in space. I want that energy transfer on a boat, RV in the middle of no where, but will never generate the energy it cost to create(the glass,aluminum,silicon, silver, and then the wind Turbine with getting the rare Earths for the generator noise and bird kills) Energy is the real money! Science people not junk science, would love to have a debate with the fact that nuclear power has a million times more energy than a chemical bond. It is 24/7 cheap clean , not the water based reactors of today a LFTR look it up. Not enough rare Earths to create enough batteries to do 1/10th of what you are saying and would increase the cost of power by 200%. Nice for the governments to tax and make more money, no we need 100 times the power at 1/30th the cost. Solar can never be more than 50% efficient and again never make back the watts that go into making them, same with wind, also these systems have to be replaced every 25 years the pollution then trying to recycle them is catastrophic for the environment..

Kurt Dobson	For thinking people; ah, the great debate on climate change. <br /><br />One way to test whether this is an honest exchange of facts and ideas is to to seed these sites with facts and ideas that either support the narrative, or contest it. I have done this over the last week on at least forty of the major taking one side or the other. <br /><br />What I found is that usually within 48 hours, anything I say that doesn&#39;t support global warming as a crisis is removed, or edited down to only language that is supportive, while anything post that would support the argument stays. Makes one wonder where the money is coming from...<br /><br />From NASA:  Based on orbital variations, Milankovitch predicted that the ice age would peak every 100,000 and 41,000 years, with additional “blips” every 19,000 to 23,000 years. Three variables of the Earth&#39;s orbit—eccentricity, obliquity, and —affect global climate. But it&#39;s a lot more complicated than that. <br /><br />And, the last ice age was about 30,000 years ago. Interestingly humans didn&#39;t do so well because it&#39;s hard to migrate and one can show that there were less than 30,000 humans that survived through mitochondrial DNA analysis. Whales, insects and such do much better and have been doing so for 100&#39;s of millions of years.<br /><br />So, I totally believe in climate change... It&#39;s been going on for 100&#39;s of millions of years, since planet formation.  Long before humans arrived; and yep, the ice caps melt, ocean levels change and humanity gets huge disruptions, then everything freezes up and people must move south to survive.<br /><br /><br /><br />And, finally any huge heroic effort by humanity to change things one way or another would take another 100k years (one cycle) to measure the effect. <br /><br />I&#39;ll wait a few days and see which if any of my comments survive whoever has time and access to edit or eliminate my input.<br /><br />It&#39;s pretty easy to get the impression that the narrative is being used as a political tool to try and get vast groups of people behind yet another &#39;crisis&#39;, then steer them to support a politician who puts himself up as a though-leader on the subject. The game is to capture votes.	UChiv0vaRdmkIXijxkj47TKQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UChiv0vaRdmkIXijxkj47TKQ	0

Yet, global warming is a theory at best; bad science in reality. A large # of world’s weather science experts disagree with global warming b/c the global warming data is being manipulated to support their warming theory &amp; maintain their significant funding; &amp; b/c the biggest impact on the globe’s temperatures is the sun not co2 emissions, cows, etc. In the 1980’s, 90’s, 2000’s we have been told the end will come in a matter of years...then those dates are passed &amp; what they predicted has not occurred. So, they ‘adjusted’ their data &amp; theory i.e. we went from a new ice age to global warming to finally climate change to cover their failed theories.

The effects of climate change are already extremely visible in our world, pacific nations like Tuvalu and Micronesia had begun to be swallowed up by the ocean, within a decade or two they'll be entirely gone. Permafrost in Siberia has melted for the first time in history releasing prehistoric carcasses and tonnes of methane. Norwegian glaciers are nearly gone entirely, Antarctica has green for the first time. Bird migration patterns are being interrupted due to warmer seas, Australia has had the hottest year on record for several years in a row. Freak weather events are getting more and more common, areas of China have flooded entirely. There's so much more. Wake up man.

I don&#39;t know about Canada they could probably become closer allies or even possibly just form into one nation which probably would give the United States more influence in this new nation then actually Canada due to their population size, even if 60% of the U.S. population dies they would still have more influence in this new nation then actual Canada would have.<br /><br /><br />Its just my crazy idea I was thinking.

Governments should act now. Musk is right in that we need Mars to give humanity a bigger chance of surviving. Another important thing to take in mind is that, apart from the rising temperature and sea levels, the frequency of natural disaster will increase drastically. With the rainforests disappearing, air quality will probably drop as well. Big challenges lie ahead of us.	UCnBjtmg5zaEuNUGbb4tig5w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnBjtmg5zaEuNUGbb4tig5w	0

At the moment we are reaching a more normal tempreture since there were a ”small ice age” between like 1300s and mid 1800s. <br />The reason why we keep beating ”records” every year is that the readings started late 1800s... and if you want to share propaganda for something you will win in... it’s very easy to just leave the info about the time before that out... well it would probably not hurt the earth to be more ”green” but we are still far from any catastrophy if we look longer than just 100-150 years back in time. <br /><br />We need a lot more sience around this subject before saying ”official” things about it... <br />often it’s said that almost all scientists are united in this... well... yes most % of what the UN choose of ”serious” science says so... however they only choose a very few % of all science they got... who says what’s serious science and not... hmm... who has the intrest and what is the intrest.. oh well... now i see... treat all science equal until other science says the opposite and later that perhaps gets proven wrong so we get back. <br />Science is only the truth until someone desides it’s not	UCBAV1Gr4_zfe8Yj3EmdqgBw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBAV1Gr4_zfe8Yj3EmdqgBw	0

More specifically, the carbon dioxide that is emitted when ~biofuels~ are burned merely returns to the atmospheric carbon dioxide that was taken into plants from the atmosphere by photosynthesis. Therefore, ~biofuels~ seem to be a very effective means for reducing these emissions”. <br /> <br />With exactly that same argument we have the following: <br /> <br />“The consumption of ~biofuels~ is one of the main causes of climate change. <b>Fossil fuels</b> can reduce ~biofuel~ consumption and thus reduce carbon dioxide emissions, because <b>fossil fuels</b> are carbon neutral. More specifically, the carbon dioxide that is emitted when <b>fossil fuels</b> are burned simply returns to the atmospheric carbon dioxide that was photosynthesized from the atmosphere by plants and marine biotic debris. Therefore, <b>fossil fuels</b> appear to be a very effective means of reducing these emissions.” <br /> <br />Remaining: <br />Fossil, remnant, impression, or trace of an <b>animal or plant</b> of a past geologic age that has been preserved in Earth&#39;s crust. <br /> <br />Have you or anybody you may or may NOT know EVER extracted OIL from a FOSSIL???? <br /> <br />Have you? Will you? Do you? Could you? <br /> …. Nop? <br /> <br />Then Fu97%ck you!	UCMICD7vL2dXCNc_BUiES5AA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMICD7vL2dXCNc_BUiES5AA	0

If the Earth&#39;s temperature hits 95 degrees F, there&#39;ll be literally nowhere to settle on Earth. If the temperature reaches 115 degrees, the oceans would start to rapidly evaporate. It&#39;s at this point that all life would die on Earth- you need oceans to survive.	UCWto-do9rrLguiw4NbZDxFg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWto-do9rrLguiw4NbZDxFg	0

It will take centuries to build up. That will prevent much farming from happening in Antarctica, as well as northern Canada, northern Russia, the northern part of the Nordic countries, Greenland, Alaska, and so fort.<br /><br />+4C is an extinction level event.

Praying for God&#39;s mercy on all! Jeremiah <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfFvLJyPf3o&amp;t=10m12s">10:12</a>–13, &quot;He hath made the earth by His power, He hath established the world by His wisdom, And hath stretched out the heavens by His discretion. When He uttereth His voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens, And He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; He maketh lightnings with rain, And bringeth forth the wind out of His treasures.&quot; Nahum 1:3, &quot;The LORD is slow to anger, and great in power, And will not at all acquit the wicked: The LORD hath His way in the whirlwind and in the storm, And the clouds are the dust of His feet.&quot; Psalm 148:8, &quot; Fire, and hail; snow, and vapour; stormy wind fulfilling His word:&quot; Matthew 24:7, &quot;For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.&quot; 2 Thessalonians 1:7-9, &quot; And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with His mighty angels, In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of His power; Malachi 4:1,2, &quot; For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch. But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in His wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall.&quot; Isaiah 13:9-13, &quot;Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, cruel both with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land desolate: and He shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it. For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light: the sun shall be darkened in His going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine. And I will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked for their iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible. I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir. Therefore I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall remove out of her place, in the wrath of the LORD of hosts, and in the day of His fierce anger.&quot; Revelation 14:7, &quot;Fear God and give glory to Him for the hour of His judgment has come!&quot;	UCCDeXATZbrIA2KvO5jGRG0g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCDeXATZbrIA2KvO5jGRG0g	0

A 4°C rise in temperatures will take many centuries to melt the polar ice caps and desertification of entire continents will be a very long process. It&#39;s not accurate to project today&#39;s geopolitical landscape directly onto a world that won&#39;t exist until the 23rd century at the absolute earliest. Global events will impact the world order several times over before the drastic climate change you describe will.	UCpJys27GhbGcpEMNN-pQprw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpJys27GhbGcpEMNN-pQprw	0

Earth would not be more dry everywhere, at least at first it would be wetter in the tropics, drier and colder in the poles. At first, with more heat, there would be more evaporation and humidity in the air, there would be more rain and stronger winds, the area afected by hurricanes and monsoons would become wider and they would be stronger. Also, with more fresh water in the sea the currents would become weaker, even stopping, it would mean less warm water getting to the poles, making it in fact colder and the ice would start to grow again. Also we must remember that for most of Earth's history there was no permanent ice on the poles, most of those periods had forests in the polar circles, for example, from 260 up to 30 million years ago Earth was ice free.

Canada would be invaded/absorbed/annexed by the U.S. (and I&#39;m Canadian, so this isn&#39;t something I&#39;m hoping for!). Russia would be invaded by literally billions of people from southern Asia, first militarily and later as refugees (no matter who wins the war). Desperate times call for desperate measures, and if the world really started changing this drastically then the first issue would be global war.

Where will these hundreds of millions live? I guess huge areas of the remaining forests would have to be chopped down in order to create the necessary space for mega cities?? And while most of the planet&#39;s surface are deserts, where - as we all know, nothing really grows - where will the Earth&#39;s oxygen be produced so that these allegedly still hundreds of millions of people in number are able to BREATHE? Or will breathing have become out of fashion? Truth rather is: in a world scenario like this the planet&#39;s population will have been wiped out almost completely, because of natural disasters such as fires and floods, wars over water, resources, land and food and global pandemics. One may assume that in the process of a rapidly increasing global temp, due to the release of mega-tons of methane from the nordic permafrosts, civilization will collapse entirely, mega famines will decimate the human race and wars and general chaos will make the remaining survivors wish they were also dead. This whole &#39;super power-thinking&#39; as featured here is so lame and obsolete, letting one assume that the folks behind this vid have actually understood nothing about a planet that is 4 degrees warmer.

I haven&#39;t watched the rest yet but it sounds like he&#39;s on the verge of hysterically laughing as he talks about rivers drying up and everything turning into a desert.<br /><br />Edit: Also, we could&#39;ve used a key to explain what we were looking at on that map. What is the brownish gray areas compared to the yellow which is sand? I thought it may be mountainous areas considering it went over the Himalayas but it&#39;s also over areas that are covered in forests right now, and wouldn&#39;t some of those mountains start having forests grown on them or become more suitable for agriculture higher up where the reason stuff can&#39;t grow right now is because of the cold? Too many questions for you to have never explained what the different colors of that map mean. It&#39;s just yellow=bad and green=good? It&#39;s not that simple. Plus, if there really are so few agriculturally stable areas left, is that map showing &quot;habitability&quot; or the potential to grow crops in those areas? Because if the green just means they could grow crops there then with better methods of supply it&#39;s still completely possible for people to live in the yellow areas, if only the yellow areas closest to the green and areas on coastal lands or near rivers that could get easy access to trade. I&#39;m just too confused by your confident conclusions in this video of how people will have to migrate, entire populations getting up and leaving rather than the possibility that flooding would be prevented the same way Louisiana avoids flooding despite all of New Orleans being below sea level. If your title was how it &quot;Could Change&quot; rather than how it &quot;Will Change&quot; I would&#39;ve given you some more leeway here. But not only aren&#39;t you describing geography in too much of this as you discuss human responses and movements, you&#39;ve made broad claims about rivers drying up and forests being destroyed without backing that up with anything. Will a 4 degree difference cause all those trees to die, or is it the lack of water from drying rivers which causes them to dry? Either way, Brazil has one of the biggest stores of water resources in the world, like Canada and Russia which are still in the green on your map. Brazil would have to deal with much hotter temperatures but I&#39;m not sure what the reason the entire Amazon would be destroyed is in your explanation. Are you saying the forests will die, then at what average temperature will they? It&#39;s weird to me that you think this would happen. <br /><br />It seems more likely that trees and vegetation that are more heat resistant will wind up surviving and dropping more seeds that grow trees like them, while other trees that couldn&#39;t handle the Gradual rise in temperatures would not reproduce as much and would die out. As any mean rise in global temperatures would be Gradual, vegetation would have some time for natural selection as it always has in the past. Forests don&#39;t just die from temperature changes. Humans have cut them down for space for farming and in the Amazon that continues to be a problem, but if the Amazon is destroyed it&#39;s not going to be from temperature change like you suggested. I don&#39;t understand where the reasoning behind it comes from, and if Brazil manages to get a leader in charge who cares more about protecting the forests than expanding agricultural businesses and logging, I can see Brazil saving the rainforest. If, and only if it is saved from being cut down much more, then Brazil&#39;s expansive water reserves should keep it alive. Cool temperatures under tree canopies in the shade should keep younger trees alive more too, making the rise in temperatures even more gradual, potentially. There are a lot of factors that go in to how vegetation survives and thrives other than just the temperature it&#39;s in. After all, forests grow in all parts of the world. Though with different trees and vegetation, that vegetation has mainly sprouted in those areas naturally and has changed on its own without our involvement for millions of years. When the temperature goes up, yes some species of plants will die, but the whole world isn&#39;t going to become a desert because of a 4 degree increase in temperature. The much more likely result will be shifts in the kinds of vegetation that thrive in different areas. Maybe forests will be lower to the ground, not grow as tall, or they will have half as many leaves and be thinner to need less water- Whatever happens, at this moment there are hundreds of ways that the world could go. And this video doesn&#39;t make me think that the future you&#39;re describing is the actual future of the Earth&#39;s geography. Not when you say some things with certainty that we really don&#39;t know. Not when you describe human migrations as if modern technology, global trade, and the information age as a whole won&#39;t alter those kinds of migrations and the need for them at all. If you were going to say such confident stuff about the desertification of forests you shouldn&#39;t have mentioned anything about the necessity for humanity to move into &quot;habitable&quot; zones like people don&#39;t already live in deserts. I&#39;m only three and a half minutes into the video but it&#39;s a shame the way this one&#39;s turning out compared to many of the other geography videos on your channel. I get that the other videos are easier to make factual because it&#39;s current geography and how it has been utilized by humans in the past, but when talking about the future in an educational video there should be both explanations and mention of your own room for error as it is not possible to Know what really will happen. You are making inferences that you treat as certainties. And I just kind of kept writing all my problems with this when I really only came down at first because the lack of a key had frustrated me.

Nation states would collapse under the influx of refugees and the chaos that would ensue, dictatorships would probably rise promising to quell the chaos. Ethnic and racial tensions would likely ensue. Remember we are talking about Billions of people dying here, it wouldn&#39;t be pretty. Or at this point maybe I should say it won&#39;t be. Remember that many of the nations that will be hardest hit (as well as some that will be least hit) have nukes as well. I can almost guarantee that China would try to conquer eastern Russia for example but would Russia let that happen without a nuclear exchange? <br /><br />Chances are also that the US would try to conquer Canada. <br /><br />And nothing short of soldiers at the border with machine gun nests would make it possible for the richer countries to prevent a massive influx of refugees. And that&#39;s assuming that they can find enough soldiers prepared to fire on unarmed and desperate civilians which wouldn&#39;t be possible without severe dehumanisation of said people. The future is looking bleak if this happens.	UCyEaY8b83JeiiVDftMnExNg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyEaY8b83JeiiVDftMnExNg	0

This means that since there is more water vapor in the air this may overall increase amount of rain which possibly less deserts.<br />Also back about 1000 years ago grapes could be grown in Southern England this is one fact that is rarely mentioned by so called climate change experts.

That forces the elder powers that be to be eliminated from ruling positions again when the over Powers need to step in through compassion &amp; in the interest of Prosperity &amp; Endless Prosperities, with Mercy for our Souls because we have no place to go &amp; can’t stay here. This would put an assured certain end to the Tyrannical way of ruling and give Choice to not choose it again when this entire evil empire ecosystem is completely destroyed because this planet is no longer inhabitable. I for one am done with joining the Tyrannical way, it was Never my intent &amp; Never will be with me, quite the opposite is necessary to have anything in the end &amp; Forevermore, Endlessly. At least most of the Planetary ice caps &amp; permafrost melting in large regions cannot be stopped by us at this point. It would take a major intervention by Planetary Makers at this point, but we can help to correct the mistakes &amp; mal calculations &amp; careless of the others who put this doomed cycle in Operations &amp; motion, and reduce the amount of Global Warming &amp; Heating that is now set to occur for quicker recoveries. By eliminating all of the factors that are actually causing Global Warming. Then we can also have the knowledge, Enablements &amp; experiences of what to do to correct large disbalances, &amp; Create &amp; keep healthy, worthy &amp; enriching Planetary Operating Balances &amp; Growths into Our Futures, wherever that may be...

In reality this green energy is just the opposite using up all earth&#39;s rare resources and destructing the environment by doing so in a rate never seen before.

In 1902 the glaciers were &quot;disappearing.&quot; In 1912 they were back to another coming &quot;Ice Age.&quot; 1923 The &quot;Ice will wipe out Canada.&quot; 1929 the scientists were back to the &quot;world is growing warmer.&quot; 1932 back to the &quot;Ice Age&quot; BS again. 1933 &quot;America in longest warm spell since 1776.&quot; What happened to the 1895 prediction of the world freezing over? 1938 &quot;Global warming.&quot; And everybody thinks this is a new phrase! LOL In 1954 &quot;The heat may be off.&quot; I guess the planet was cooling again. Then in 1969 they were back to the global warming and claimed the &quot;North Pole may become an open sea within a decade or two&quot; and that &quot;England will not exist in the year 2000.&quot; Has anybody seen England lately? How about the North Poll? I&#39;m pretty certain Canada is still around too as I keep hearing about some dick head named Trudeau who hates Trump and guns. Also in 1969 these same alarmists were worried about overpopulation and thus starvation for the world. 1970 the cold weather is back; &quot;no relief in sight&quot; said the Washington post. 1974, &quot;Global cooling for the past 40 years&quot; Said time magazine. Did they sleep through the global warming of the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s? Also in 1974 &quot;harbinger of another ice age&quot; Washington Post; &quot;experts would assign near certainty to major crop failure and mass deaths by starvation&quot; the New York Times. 1975  &quot;the threat of a new ice age must now stand alongside nuclear war as a likely source of wholesale death and misery for mankind” Nigel Calder, editor, New Scientist magazine.  1981 &quot;Global warming of an almost unprecedented magnitude&quot; New York Times.   ANYONE BEGINNING TO SEE THE BACK AND FORTH Bull S**T YET? Scientists have claimed gloom and doom by weather, famine, massive earth quakes, tornados, hurricanes, volcanos and every other scare tactic they could think of that would put them in the lime light for their 15 minutes of fame. Climate has a natural cycle of warming and cooling and mankind doesn&#39;t control it nor can mankind change it!!!

Alaska and Greenland would likely become their own nations. Most of North and South America would likely move to Canada and Alaska. Oceania would likely move to the habitable parts of Australia and New Zealand. Africa would move to the habitable parts on the western part of the continent. The Middle East and Asia would be forced to move to Russia, along with most of Europe.	UCVLY1uNesxMp5MwwKsS2tMw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVLY1uNesxMp5MwwKsS2tMw	0

Much of the melting permafrost is infested with known and unknown deadly germs and diseases.<br />2. No one will take care on hundreds of nuclear facilities and highly radioactive nuclear fuel storages.<br />3. Remaining land around polar regions cant be turn into fertile ground in such a short time, and certainly isn&#39;t enough to feed several billions of people.<br />4. Temperatures will rise by at least six - not four degrees Celsius.<br />5. Global civilization requires strong global industry also. That means energy, mining, economy, trade, environmental impacts... too complicate system which certainly won&#39;t survive in such turbulent conditions.<br />5. Knowing humans, there will be WW3 before any settle about land or migration.<br />6. It will came much, much faster than most of us expecting.

UgwWuevQTRWXTG2swHF4AaABAg	1	1	2020-07-24 01:02:56	Sapioit	The biggest factor for making that map a reality is air humidity and how to harvest it. Fog harvesting has been done, and floating some black materials with many holes right below the water would cause evaporation, which would increase precipitations. From there, we only need to bioengineer and/or selectively breed plants to live in hotter climates, and better manage the water, and all this can be avoided. Pair that with selective/cyclical grazing to improve the soil quality, for better results.<br /><br />Even something as simple as using greenhoused ponds to evaporate seawater and leave behind salt or very concentrated brine, funnels to concentrate the vapors, large pipes to move the vapors, and then using solar chimneys to both generate electricity and to cool down the water vapors into liquid water (due to the vaccum effect caused at the ground level effectively dropping the temperature, and air currents getting more high speed air into contact with the cooling pipes and radiators, and due to solar chimneys effectively moving heat higher up into the atmosphere, where the surface area it occupies is larger and above much of the atmosphere, which makes irradiating the heat into space easier), and using shades instead of greenhouses for growing crops (for reducing the amount of sunlight and the temperatures, which would also reduce the evaporation of the water from the soil).

UgwWuevQTRWXTG2swHF4AaABAg.9BTs7rbWMFn9BTs8Ji-Gic		1	2020-07-24 01:02:59	Sapioit	And the same processes could be used today to turn today's existing deserts into farmland and forests. Trees for holding the structural integrity of the soil so you don't flood with mud, and since you can use the shade they provide to grow other crops which otherwise would not grow there due to too much sunlight or too high temperatures. Add to that tethered hot air baloons which to hold shades above the ground, especially useful for shading cities, and you have a recipe for success. And this is not even taking into account the usage of active-support space-towers to move a lot of the heat from the ground to outside the atmosphere, effectively getting a county-sized to planet-sized air conditioning unit (depending on the specifications). And if you export heat to space anyway, you could also move some of that heat into the arctic circle to permanently melt the ice while cooling other parts of the world, and use the active-support space-towers to import electricity and to hold mirrors to light the arctic circle, to effectively turn the whole land mass of the planet green.

The amount of money and time and effort that could even hope to make a dent in anything wouldn&#39;t even be worth it, and most countries won&#39;t try it. The earth is eventually going to chew us up and spit us back out, and frankly, humans trying to do anything to stop or slow that process is honestly laughable.

For example, shading the land, getting water vapors from the sea to inland in sunlight and then releasing them into the shaded areas to condense into mist and dew and maybe even rain, and making the shades reflective and focusing them onto power-generating towers (like they currently do with solar collector-concentrators, but with the reflective shading material), bioengineering and/or selectively breeding plants to do well in higher temperatures, using solar chimneys to cause local cooling and to condense the mist into liquid water with by running it through a large-enough radiator, and a whole lot more.

Refugee camps in Greece are burning to the ground and nobody cares, thousands drown in the mediterranean and nobody cares and all the western world is inching towards fascism just because of an influx of a few million refugees and migrants from different cultures seeking better opportunities. Add in entire continents becoming unliveable and basic resources lile water and food getting scarce to the point of warranting wars, causing nations to collapse and the premise of an orderly resettlement of the world's poorest and most downtrodden people to wealthy nations that can't even be bothered to fix the less extreme problems of our time becomes too absurd to seriously consider.

We well see less and less stars at night, and eventually sunlight will also be reflected away from the Earth due to higher humidity in our upper atmosphere, and at some point Darkness will spread across the Earth.

Perhaps the sudden rise will disrupt, but I think you need at least 4c temp rise to start such disbalance. And I do reckon the reality of us having to check on carbon emissions is sinking in. Besides the role of the Amazon and all rainforests in oxygen and carbon cycles is way over rated. The oceans' algae plankton are the dominant source of global oxygen. Oceans contain about 60 times the CO2 amount of the 1880 's atmosphere, or 16 times the total terrestrial biosphere, including soils. Most of that carbon is out of reach in lower layers of the oceans, yet those upper layers are dominant. Oceans also have taken up about 90% of the heat and +40% of carbon emissions so far. We rally oughta spend more on oceanography, but oddly, the world's smartest and richest seems more obsessed of getting people to the Moon and on Mars. Oh well...

I'll just give you one simple example: if the Amazon rain forest was desert, the earth's oxygen level would be cut in half, meaning mass extinctions. It's become beyond comprehension just how misinformed citizens are. The current rate of change on earth is 10kX faster than all past extinction events. What's that mean? I don't have those answer's, but its the equivalent of walking across a thousand Mile desert with no food or water, it's not if you will die, but when you'll die. I'm 100% confident, not many people understand the current peer reviewed science that clearly shows we have no chance of changing direction and our time is now measured in decades, not centuries. I'll close with one more mistake in this outrageous video, when the earth's average temp exceeds 3 to 4 deg C, the feedback loops will move us into the 10 to 12deg C neighborhood. The END!!

Earth "could" become Venus like . I know this is a 'doomsday' scenario and we may be able to stop it, but we ARE running out of time, the tundra Siberia are already releasing gas to the point where the Russians cannot tap the resources fast enough and are desperate to sell it to Europe.

I dont think these cooling effects are going to see-saw climate change as some are predicting. Thats kinda.......what the world has already been doing for millions of years remember?

It's no joke when the IPCC. warns that we must prevent 2degree warming before 2030 to have any real chance to prevent a 4 degree rise by 2050, the permafrost thaw would result in the seas heating up and at that point the greenhouse effect could go 'runaway'! meaning we cant stop it and were heading for a planet like Venus.

When ice melts those currents slow down. theses slowing currents stop the water from circulating and heat moving around. While the earth will initially heat up there is a possibility that the slowing ocean currents due to ice melt, would cause global cooling and possibly another ice age.

Any old plastic roofing should be disposed of at the bottom of old mine&#39;s deep underground, far away from water table&#39;s and far away from ocean&#39;s.<br />If done this way, yes in the long term if normal houses were coated in a reflective (NON TOXIC) material it could in theory lower the Earths temp over time, without having to use plastics.<br />But just dumping this greenhouse plastics like Spain are doing atm, is BAD big time.

And it wasn't even one ice age but many cycles of interglacial ages and ice ages, the last one ending at the end of the Pleistocene when the Holocene epoch begins (the current one). No arguments about that in the scientists community, it's just a fact. So keep telling clowns like me to check Google and not doing so yourself, you're very smart.

CO2 rises follow climate change. Do the homework!!! That’s not to say we don’t need to take action to stabilise our planet’s climate. But we are talking about far more difficult things than man-made CO2, we are talking about sunspots, our trip around the Milky Way and the cosmic dust we encounter enroute, volcanic eruptions, natural variability in climate, which has always happened, and at the same time, trying to prevent the next mini-ice age, which is an overdue Earth event.

Same with northern Siberia and most of northern Canada. There is another problem......... understatement........ as you move to higher latitudes, the intensity of the sunlight diminishes over a given area and the seasons shift. Pollinators will have to adjust, and most won&#39;t make it. So, garden vegetables will have to be grown in greenhouses to exclude pests and people will have to hand pollinate, which produces less robust and healthy plants, fruits and seeds. No more &quot;amber waves of grain&quot;, either.<br />As the rivers dry up in the south, the nuclear plants and the numerous spent fuel cooling ponds will not have sufficient water, or power, to pump over the fuel bundles to keep them from going Fukushima. Thousands of tons of nuclear material will be released as gas, smoke, and chunks as the pools dry out and experience &quot;prompt nuclear events&quot;....... like unit 3 at Fukushima Daiichi. Then, there will be a LOT of warfare and some of it will eventually be nuclear. Pakistan vs. India. India vs China. US vs Russia. The EMPs will finish off the grid in most places. No power at the plug, no internet, no phones, no petroleum being pumped OR refined, no water at the taps, no fuel or radar for planes, no nat. gas pumped or processed, no diesel for trucks or trains....so no food brought to stores, no harvesting machinery operating, no controlling dams&#39; spillways, and the list goes on and on. Sea level rise will take out almost all seaports, so no moving food or material by sea, even IF fuel was available. <br />There is nothing to stop the GAST increase once it gets a good head of steam... it will blow right past 4C. increase and sail past 6C. and may not stop until 12 or 13C., if it stops at all. Think of Venus. Yes, that could be the inevitable destination.	UCE68XGYvjmnxRnBsMOT87hA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE68XGYvjmnxRnBsMOT87hA	0

To make a difference would take 100 Sq. km. coverage I think. If you imagine covering the oceans around a coastal area you would need to cover 100s of Sq. km. with some kind of plastic? it degrades in the sun and would need replacing yearly ultra violet inhibitors in it would help but only slightly. Who's gonna pay? and then you still have to hope or install fans to blow it where you want it. In cities like Bagdad they do have houses you know but if it's 50C outside it warms up very fast, not everyone can afford aircon or has the money to run them. There's no easy solution, water is a problem so growing trees in parched infertile soils is not gonna happen. I would suggest they invest in desalination plants run on solar/wind energy also in AU. we have lots of coastline and a lot of vacant sun scorched land, vast solar panel farms would even help to lower the soil temp and if they were raised and watered by the desal plants might even be productive, but at scale it takes a LOT of money. Mid/Est countries spend a lot of money to control/suppress their ppl. and probably wouldn't spend for the ppl.s' sake anyway!

Honestly, Russia right now could use Fresnal Mirror Walls to be able to have a port with direct access to the oceans on their eastern coast. The downside is that it would still have to be outside of the arctic circle, to work the whole year, but the advantage is that with floating structures, they would get a channel/canal. Just reflect a bit part of the sunlight onto a thin strip thick enough for ships to pass through, and maybe even have some floating docks somewhere in the open seas, like the oil platforms, and you've got a more threatening Russia. And if you're at it, why not use similar fresnel mirror walls to green most of Russia in the process. I mean, the only countries in which such decisions can lead ot immediate change are China and Russia, and China is a lot more threatening right now, and Russia seems to have learned from the ongoing downfall of USA.

For example, partially shading the land to reduce temperatures and to reduce water evaporation, getting water vapors from the sea to inland in sunlight and then releasing them into the shaded areas to condense into mist and dew and maybe even rain, and making the shades reflective and focusing them onto power-generating towers (like they currently do with solar collector-concentrators, but with the reflective shading material), bioengineering and/or selectively breeding plants to do well in higher temperatures, using solar chimneys to cause local cooling and to condense the mist into liquid water with by running it through a large-enough radiator, and a whole lot more. My point is that even today, we could turn the deserts into lush-green farmlands and forests, if people really wanted it bad enough to research it and get it done. But they don't.

They are talking about and predict things like they would never seen Earth&#39;s climate in action.<br />You can&#39;t have more water vapor and the same time more deserts. And global temperature doesn&#39;t rise all over the globe equally. If Earth average temperature would go up by 4°C id doesn&#39;t mean that all today temperature would just go everywhere up by 4°C, but it would be the different, mainly depending on latitude. Equator would have the same temperatures as today but poles might have 10°C higher average temperatures. So, Earth would not turn to &#39;&#39;Arrakis&#39;&#39; but climate zones would change. Ask yourself what would change to this specific climate zone, if you add more water vapor and temperature. Deserts are deserts because of geographical features, fore some reasons they don&#39;t get enough water vapor to sustain plants. And places with low amount of water vapor are the hottest places on Earth. If earth would be warmer for 4°C it would become green AF. Yeah, sea level would rise but there would be less deserts and more areas with rain forests and subtropic forests.	UCd2S11GWVCNb6dRRo5bz_WA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd2S11GWVCNb6dRRo5bz_WA	0

The permafrost will melt, leading to many houses falling apart (this happens already today). Temperatures in Siberia and near the poles will also increase more than the global average, and add to that an inland climate which can lead to extremely hot summers. Extremely hot summers, in a place filled with millions of square kilometres of forest - I'm sure you can guess what that will lead to.

Bro, did you see the scene in &quot;Our Planet&quot; where all the walruses were falling off the cliffs to their deaths because there was no ice already, due to climate change? This video is such BS. I am not a climate scientist but I have apparently taken more time to educate myself on the topic than you did to make this video. Climate change patterns are more complicated that just being based on lattitude as you seem to think in this video. The earth is not warming uniformly. For example right now the arctic is warming much faster than the rest of the planet. Also, climate is influenced in no small part by ocean currents which will be disrupted by climate change, and things like changes in ocean temperatures and salinity. Another things this video ignores is the devastating effect climate change will have on ecosystems even in the milder parts of the planet, ecosystems that we are a part of. Another way climate change may already be effecting us is that many scientists believe that disease epidemics like the current one will become more common as the earth warms. This video just seems so speculative and uninformed, I think you would have been better off not making it. I usually like your videos, too.

Canada&#39;s new huge population would be good because Canada is geographically enormously large. Specially Russia because of Siberia&#39;s size and natural resources. Russia would be able to control an even bigger navy. Plus since Japan is now deserted, natural disasters wouldn&#39;t be really a problem at all.

Climate Change is has and will always be caused by the changes in the tilt of the earths axis north star and proximity to the SUN. The source of all energy in our solar system. Global warming is happening because as the Earth's axis continues to tilt towards the sun. More DIRECT sunlight reaches the higher latitudes poles. Warming the southern hemisphere heat sink oceans and thawing the northern hemisphere frozen co2 continents. Which is why temperature rises first and co2 follows. Cause and effect. The inconvenient truth about the MILANKOVITCH cycles causing ClimateChange is that every 13 k years when the Precession of the north star aligns the equator with the solar orbital plane the gravitational pull of the SUN pulls tsunami's around the planet East to west because the planet spins west to east. The climate cycles of our water planet are continental glaciers with lower sea levels brought on by Global tsunami's every 13 k years. The one off about the slow rise of sea levels as the continental glaciers thaw is the Zanclean flood of the Mediterranean. Earth is a closed loop that self regulates co2 with LIFE.

Things do not suddenly become dry when they get hot, nor become lush and green when they go from cool to temperate. Some places will get drier, it&#39;s true. But many places will get wetter as well as higher rates of ocean evaporation fuel larger and stronger storm systems.<br /><br />I couldn&#39;t make an accurate map without a lot of data, but figuring out that &quot;The tropics basically become one vast desert besides a narrow band in west Africa&quot; is incorrect just takes some basic knowledge.

Countries with heavier rain don't spike in temperature too much, so it's likely that rain would rather fall in more northern areas, even though saying that the world would be a desert is a bit inaccurate.

UgzCSyEJZWe1ni-yDgV4AaABAg	3	22	2020-06-08 07:45:37	Mz RW	“Forget the past, don’t worry about the future, and live in the present.” This popular quote in society seems reasonable at first, but it is incorrect. Why should we forget the past, when it is one of the best sources to learn from our mistakes and become a better world?<br /><br /><br />The Homo Sapien species has been around for 200, 000 (two hundred thousand years) years, but humans didn’t become civilised until 130,000 years ago. Over these years humans created extinctions, and disasters that affected the world and the creatures that lived in the Earth, but mostly, humans affected themselves. We cannot cover up every war, every destroyer of  civilisation, every disturbance in the entire history. Events such as global warming, animal extinction, global wars, destruction of trees, interruptions of peaceful and innocent races, famines and every other dark event were all created by humans, and some events, not included in the list, are even denied existence. Instead of trying to cover these errors, we should try and learn from them, and never repeat them.<br /><br /><br />Our past experiences are composed of 2 key things: success, and failure. Either way, we can learn from them and correct ourselves to become better people. For success, we think why it was successful, and how it was successful. If we succeed in winning an award, we would think back how we achieved this prize and the road we took to achieve it. For failure, we think why it was unsuccessful and we’ll try to prevent it from happening. If suddenly your economy collapsed, you would think what did you do incorrectly that led you to failure. The past is a way to learn, and whether the events were successful or unsuccessful, we can still pursue our journey to a better life.<br /><br /><br />Your experiences are precious, but what about others? Everyone has and will experience the world differently, and their experiences are just as valuable as your own experiences. Picture an elder, who walked the earth for a hundred years, who tells you their knowledge and view of the world. Imagine how much more knowledge you can share with your friends now! Or you can even use this knowledge and branch it off even further. But no matter what you do with this information, you would have learnt something you would have never known and become more aware of the world.<br /><br /><br />Learning from others is a great source of information, but what about our parents? Your parents may have put a few rules around the house or even warnings, such as “don’t watch TV too long!” Although it is annoying, there could be entire stories that created these rules. Your parents could have experienced failure in the past, and some of them can never be changed. Like any parent, they would want the next generation to avoid the mistakes they made, which if followed could become the golden child of perfection. <br /><br /><br />The past is full of secrets and wonders and the experiences they give are valuable and meaningful. Society’s quote of forgetting the past is incorrect and gives a wrong idea to the world and its happenings. Whether it&#39;s from history, your family’s, or yours, it will give you wisdom about the world and how we live.	UCd54QjuLUvwRHMpR5V4wX1g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd54QjuLUvwRHMpR5V4wX1g	0

Personally I doubt that 3/4ths of the Earth would become desert because, as the Earth warms up, the atmosphere can hold more suspended moisture. We would definitely see an initial dieback of Forrest as soil moisture evaporates rapidly, drying out world soils. After that, rain patterns would drastically change. As a result regional jungles and forrests would pop up in places not seen before like you mentioned in the video. I imagine more that drought stricken farmland would revert into new variations of savanna ecosystems. As a result of Sea level rise,. Many swamps and lagoons might actually grow. Still a really well done video RLL!	UCYNgtHHwuko7wEisoJPkSBg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYNgtHHwuko7wEisoJPkSBg	0

You can solve it with permanently shade large areas, to lower the temperatures and reduce evaporation. This would also work to get water vapors from the sea through a funnel-and-pipes system to those shaded areas, where it would condense into mist and/or rain. But current desertic countries don't want bad enough to solve their heat problem, or they are actively stopped by other countries from even attempting it. If the shades were also reflective, that heat would radiate away into space, or it could be focused on a wall and used for solar power, and the excess heat from that and from industry could pumped into radiator-towers or radiator-wall-skyscrappers located outside of cities and high above the farmlands, to have air currents take the excess heat away. This would also allow for large-scale refrigeration, and I mean even city-sized or bigger.

I mean, if I remember correctly, arabs import most of their food. So if something happened which made them unable to import that food (like war, for example, or economic sanctions, or a trade ban caused by a second more dangerous coronaplague wave, or even just natural disasters causing the exporting countries to not have enough food to export), then they would be screwed. Plus that turning the desert areas into farmland would severely increase the living conditions of the people there and the GDP of every nation in the world (thanks to trade). At the very least, it would allow the people who already own land and have infrastructure in areas which recently turned into desert, to claim back farmland from the desert and increase the land value of the land they own. And depending on how much they are willing to pay and the conditions in the area at that time, it would be significantly cheaper than moving somewhere else by selling their land before making it productive again. And don't worry about FBI, it probably already knows my location but I'm not a threat to them. The Almighty AI is almighty indeed.

The original title of this video was &quot;What if the world got 4 degrees warmer&quot;, but I guess that wouldn&#39;t fly. Here&#39;s the real version: this is probably maybe what would happen if the earth got that much warmer and continued to maintain a similar or warmer temperature... For centuries. Nothing noticeable to us humans is even predicted to happen until 2100 at our current pace, and it does not include deserts, acid rains, the atmosphere spontaneously combusting, or whatever else the whining about us going extinct due to climate change includes. It&#39;s amusing to watch how these people flail about without realizing the timescale of these things. We&#39;re more likely to either blow ourselves up or have colonies on extraterrestrial bodies by the time any of this would actually impact us to any meaningful degree. Unless it&#39;s Africa.

Even renewable energy has its drawbacks- especially battery and solar power because both solar panels and many rechargable batteries require rare earth metals and other very hard-to-find materials. Rare earth metals in specific have to be extracted in tiny amounts from a massive quantity of rock via strip mining, which fucks up the land, and also creates toxic sludge as a byproduct of extracting the metals from the rock. You have to process MIND BOGGLING amounts of rock to get just a MINUSCULE amount of these metals, and on top of that, over 90% of the Earth's entire reserve of them is in China, and China has ENTIRE LAKES filled with said sludge. Nuclear power (Fission at least) is very bad because the power plants can belch up huge clouds of highly radioactive, toxic and carcinogenic gasses that spread across the entire planet, and radiation leaks from this can render large amounts of land uninhabitable for more than TWENTY THOUSAND YEARS. Not only that, but fission produces spent fuel that stays radioactive for hundreds of THOUSANDS of years, and you have to store it in such a secure way that we really CAN'T completely eliminate the risk of the waste being discovered or freed from its storage by a natural disaster. FUSION, however, is the best possible source of power in my opinion, at least it WILL be, once our tech for it gets reliable enough.

People like you said we couldn’t get the solar micro-grid system in Bangladesh working. You are probably too much of a religious dumbass to even know what that is, look it up, you’ll realise you were wrong. Keep doubting the technology, you will be proven wrong. Every. Single. Time. Given enough time people will wake up and realise that your conservative religious beliefs are stupid and will fix things against your wishes, as they always have historically, my only fear is that for the first time in history, people don’t have like 50 years to finally open their eyes, I am not optimistic, people like you have always resisted change but you’ve always lost in the end (even if it takes a very long time), but I fear you guys may finally win, I think this may finally be the end...

When ice sheets melt, it would just expose bare rock, not arable land, right? Also, let&#39;s say that in 100 years the Southern US &amp; Mexico become as hot as the Amazon is today. Why then would the US and Mexico become a desert and not a humid tropical climate? If the world has more liquid water and more tropical temperatures, why would so many new deserts form? Once again, I&#39;m no scientist or researcher, but this video is really counterintuitive.	UCps0Bw0WdA7XTljfwxpaWzg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCps0Bw0WdA7XTljfwxpaWzg	0

If the earth warms then the trade winds would likely strengthen giving stronger monsoons and cyclones and greater uplift where the monsoonal trough is located. this chart highly dubious at best. Luckily it’s just a wild stab in the dark that 4 degrees increase in the global average mean temperature.	UC1H9xQMSHGoOzDg6dVGJX_Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1H9xQMSHGoOzDg6dVGJX_Q	0

Its getting wetter and at risk of flooding due to climate change. You don&#39;t get deserts on small islands surrounded by waters, but in the middle of the continents. Same for India, as the Monsoon weather will only inensify and Himalayan Mountains stop moisture, and only northern India will have lack of rain. Regarding other statements they are just so vague, as if pulled out from the ass: Here will be desert, here will be inhabitable, New Zealand will be only one true habitable...blablbalbalblablablabla.

It was 4 above today and everything was OK. Maybe we as humans are not prepared for such changes, but nature will adjust even to 18-20 Celsius dregrees.

As of now we already deal with problems caused by climate change since us states closer to the poles are the msot affected right now. The change of weather patterns is keeping our farming industry in a dangerous position, with dry periods so long that it can kill several crops and the increasingly more common storm floods which are strong enough to drown the crops, therefore also killing them. You can&#39;t count on us buddy, just saying. <br />Also Greenland is slowly seeking independence so...	UCKv1PVUZYtnNn9E-vZDpapg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKv1PVUZYtnNn9E-vZDpapg	0

Earth has been several times hotter, take Mesozoic era for example. During the Late Cretaceous it was around 27-37 degrees Celsius. That’s way hotter than today. But guess what, there were a lot of forest areas around the world. Heck even places that no longer have them today. So what’s more likely is rising sea levels, stronger storms, and of course melting of ice. So yeah the Amazon might be gone by then, in fact, there’s evidence to support that, since it’s getting drier. We can’t forget about diseases as well. Tropics diseases now can expand their range thx to this warming climate. So yes, soon we can see the Yellow Fever happening in places like Russia. Also the glaciers are important, because they contain some unknown virus. And not to mention wildfires, they will be more common. Just imagine the Australian fire, but at a much bigger scale. So the world will be a messed up place. And it’s highly unlikely for us to survive.	UCm25sO_OhgoovfzZyeOmXmw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm25sO_OhgoovfzZyeOmXmw	0

It may be more chaotic and in many other ways bad for human society and the speed may be bad for many animals and plants to adapt to quickly, but ultimately a slightly warmer world wouldn&#39;t be one of massive desserts, at least not much more than today. Just like it wasn&#39;t at all the other times it was that much hotter.<br />Not saying we shouldn&#39;t stop worsening climate change asap, but this map is just ridiculous.

Somewhere like Japan will see higher rainfall/stronger typhoons/longer rainy seasons as the sea of Japan between Japan and Korea warms. They&#39;ll get typhoons on all coasts instead of mostly on the Pacific coasts. <br /><br />Cyclones will happen further and further south on the east and west coasts of Australia for a longer season and with more intensity. We&#39;re already seeing this happen. It will be less inhabitable, but not because it&#39;s a &quot;desert&quot;, because of weather events. <br /><br />This is just another thought experiment though: fun to think about but I&#39;m not a climate scientist. They&#39;re the ones we should listen to when we make policy decisions in the real world.	UC7vbXx_51-SGrvXTvLjYtUQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7vbXx_51-SGrvXTvLjYtUQ	0

And that currently is the main thing that keeps the British Isles from looking like Denmark or Sweden. So before they become desert, they become really cold.<br />2. The civilisational success of countries is less determined by their geography than by their social structure and their beliefs and how that fits within the state of the world around them. For example, the biggest thing keeping Russia behind is not geography, it&#39;s the Russians. Same goes for many other nations. Those things take a long time to form and to change. Historically civilisations rose and fell not due to climate change.	UCFBKNnYH_d6n5NkwJf-qbrQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFBKNnYH_d6n5NkwJf-qbrQ	0

So it is RIDICULOUS to talk about what human governments or people will be doing at that point: if there are any left, they will be hiding from each other and scavenging for food and shelter.<br />Another BIG problem with this video is the assumption that heat is the only problem... that food supplies won&#39;t be broken by heat, erratic weather (floods, etc.), pollution, war... that tundra and permafrost can rapidly become farmland when today&#39;s arable lands are deserts... that there will be unpolluted fresh water supplies... that the oceans will not have been overfished or polluted into barrenness by that time... that there will not have been nuclear weapons exchanges as resource wars intensify... that the world&#39;s nuclear power facilities won&#39;t all (or almost all) be in meltdown as a result of these upheavals...<br />So, again, it is RIDICULOUS to talk about what human governments or people will be doing at that point: if there are any left, they will be hiding from each other and scavenging for food and shelter.<br />As it stands, this video is a huge disservice.<br />I&#39;d like to ask that you take it down, do your homework, put a little more actual thought into what you represent about the future, and then decide whether or not to post again on this topic.<br /><br />Thanks.

Weather patterns will definitely change but the overall effect would be more tropical zones. If you dont believe me, take a look back in history. In the Mesozoic era, Global temps and CO2 levels were higher than today, the resulting climate included tropical rainforests across most of the equator and even at mid latitudes, where drier conditions did exist, they were savannas and not full deserts<br /><br />2) There will be no mass relocation/migrant crisis because of climate change<br />-The very definition of &quot;climate&quot; is the overall weather conditions over a long of time. In the odd chance climate change does make conditions worse, it will not all happen in 1 year, rather, it will be spread out over time (maybe 20, 50 or 1000 years). Humans do not adapt to change in one generation but they certainly do over many generations as seen with culture, language, population centers. Given it may take many generations to feel the effects, Humans will naturally move, relocate, whatever t suit their needs. It will be done naturally as individuals decide to buy a new home and companies relocate factories. Ask yourself this question: 100 years ago, did the population centers look the same as they are today? No, look at the most populated areas and you&#39;ll see how humans have slowly moved for whatever reason (economic, climate, productivity) There was no sudden movement every time there was a drought or flood so why should we expect the same later?<br /><br />3) Humans don&#39;t need perfect conditions to live (at least in the 21st century)<br />-10,000 years ago, if a river dried up, the people around it died. In 2020 however if a river dries up, the people do not simply die, rather they build pipelines, wells, etc to bring the water to them. Imperial valley in California is technically a desert yet it has one of the most fertile farmland in all of California, why is that? They have a canal that supplies all the water they need. Look at Phoenix, temps are sometimes 100F yet its population grows everyday. A/C has eliminated our dependence on good weather and humans will live wherever they can. A change in outside climate will not adversely affect the living conditions of the average home. To add onto this, relocation costs would be too much and cities will find a way to live with what they have. They may build desalination plants, install check valves, use renewables, etc, but they will certainly not move like our ancestors did in the past. We are smarter than that	UC7kiIVD-hfeg8ZJ5hnqcKYg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7kiIVD-hfeg8ZJ5hnqcKYg	0

You only need to permanently shade large areas, to lower the temperatures and reduce evaporation. This would also work to get water vapors from the sea through a funnel-and-pipes system to those shaded areas, where it would condense into mist and/or rain. But the arabs don't want bad enough to solve their heat problem to actually test those things. If the shades were also reflective, that heat would radiate away into space, or it could be focused on a wall and used for solar power, and the excess heat pumped into radiator-towers to have air currents take the excess heat away. This would also allow for large-scale refrigeration, and I mean even city-sized or bigger.

The reason most of Antarctica and Greenland both remain icey is because of how even more mountainous they are. Western Canada and Alaska are also largely mountainous. Even in the most extreme scenario like shown, many people will still remain in their country because of how little importance arable land is for agriculture in a world is vertical farming, air conditioning, desalination plants etc. In a world this extreme, climate change is less of a concern to move to green energy as it will be the potential running out of oil.

The Earth is absolutely warming up, but when the Earth heats up, it doesn't automatically mean deserts form. The Earth will become crazy humid and tropical rainforests would form everywhere. More water+more heat=more precipitation and humidity. A lack of precipitation creates deserts, and there will still be rain in this warm world. Hell there would be more rain because of how much ice would melt and evaporate into the atmosphere.

Also, it&#39;s not like pluvial forests (extremely rich in both flora and fauna) can&#39;t exist near the Equator or at fairly high temperatures. Let&#39;s clarify it, I think climate change is a main issue and we should do our best to protect our current ecosystems, but the scenario of Khanna&#39;s map just seems too far-fetched to me.

UgzPlvqWfwfLRIVD_s94AaABAg.98wLn7j4n1-9D4WmbpN8Yn		4	2020-09-01 21:49:26	Jouret Goulven	20 000 years ago Earth was actually 4 degrees celsius cooler (we're talking average temperature) and half of north America and northen Europe were just big glaciers. My country (France) looked like Greenlands, and the sea level was 130 meters below what it is today. The climate took 10 000 years to change, now imagine what another 4 degrees up but in only 100 years will do. And you can add to that the hundreds of millions of people who will migrate just to try to stay alive and you get an idea of what's coming. But yeah, let's keep business as usual, extracting and using oil, coal etc till we burn it all and we'll build a bright future for ourselves and for the ones coming next.

Starting right now would be even smarter.<br />By the way, some ice covered zones and permafrost may hide dangerous old diseases (like the anthrax outbreak in Russia a few years ago) that could delay the migration process. Also without the cold currents that come from the poles, places like Chile would become even warmer.<br />Things can always turn worse. Let&#39;s try to avoid it.

With a colder climate and less growt. It will be less co2 . Less co2 = less plants food . So whats still grows will grow slower. <br />Today we have only about 350 ppm of co2 . If we get under 180 ppm. All Green life on earth will die. <br />Do you still want less co2 and a colder earth ? Yes ? Then you also are willing to see billions of people die to starvation.

UgxllmcL3kO7xI6e9CR4AaABAg	0	0	2020-05-21 18:13:48	Nicky Liu	Couple of points:<br />+ If the atmosphere became 4°C warmer, that would mean that the air becomes much more moist (hot air can hold more water and oceans evaporating faster), which would result in more rain. Why would there be so much desert?<br />+ The fact that there is more heat energy in the air, would likely change the planetary wind system, which could bless many spots with favourable climate, just like the British Isles today. Again, why so many deserts?<br />+ The closer you get to the poles the less solar energy you get, which reduces traditional and greenhouse farming to only the few months around summer. Crop production would not be able to keep up with global demand without vertical farming and farming in the sunnier regions.<br />+ Siberia/Central Asia is far far away from the sea latitudewise. That kind of continental weather is usually very dry, hardly appropriate for farming.<br /><br />Way before our history Earth already had several phases of very hot world climates, hotter than just 4°C from now. And during these ages Earth was a tropical world, with gigantic plants, pushing the oxygen level to 30%, supporting titanic lifeforms. Was that possible, if everything was desert?

Some calculations suggest about 2-4 metres depending on the amount of ice accounted for and the expansion of the warmer ocean water. This does not sound like much, but is enough to flood most coastal cities like New York. It is also enough to flood non vulcanic islands and land in river deltas like Bangladesh, the Amazon and the Netherlands. If anything is wrong with the amount of flooding in this video, it is that there is not nearly enough of it.

Climate change has more ramifications than the world becoming a desert. Obviously sea levels would rise, but weather patterns would change as well.

However in a warmer world, the air will have more ability to retain moisture, therefore more rain on the western side of mountain chains etc. If anything there will be more and larger rain events than we have at the moment. <br />I certainly can&#39;t see all the rivers drying out that this video thinks will.

For example, shading the land, getting water vapors from the sea to inland in sunlight and then releasing them into the shaded areas to condense into mist and dew and maybe even rain, and making the shades reflective and focusing them onto power-generating towers (like they currently do with solar collector-concentrators, but with the reflective shading material), bioengineering and/or selectively breeding plants to do well in higher temperatures, using solar chimneys to cause local cooling and to condense the mist into liquid water with by running it through a large-enough radiator, and a whole lot more.

The earth also slowly regains its ability to become greener due to the rise in the much needed gas of life which co2 is. Nature organises itself to keep the system going, so while the atmospheric co2 levels needed to sustain all life on earth were continuously dropping throughout history threatening plant life worldwide nature created a new animal homo sapiens who was smart enough to excavate the captured co2 from millions of years of fotosynthese which was building up in the groundlayers in the form of oil , natural gas and coal. By using these fossil fuels as energy source they release the building blocks of life in the form of co2 molecules. 200 years ago the atmospheric co2 levels reached a dangerously low point when they were at 300 ppm, now we ar slowly repleting the depleted volumes and are now at around 400 ppm, far away still from the 10 times higher volumes that were present when the earth was on its greenest with the highest biodiversity ever seen but it's a start. Unfortunately enough some species of homo sapiens have found a way to scandalously enrich themselves by labeling co2 as a pollutant creating a new but very ecological destructive industrial branch namely "green" energy. In reality this green energy is just the opposite using up all earth's rare resources and destructing the environment by doing so in a rate never seen before.

I’m sure there’ll be more intense weather events and more intense droughts but the whole world becoming a desert? Probably not. Greenland, Scandinavia, Siberia, Canada, Alaska becoming arable? Definitely not. Siberia and the Canadian Shield are currently cold, dry wastelands. Just because the cold goes away doesn’t take away from the fact that they’d still be dry wastelands. This is the only RLL video I have ever disliked because of how far-fetched and inaccurate it is. I’m not an expert but there are so many flaws with the basis of this video. It doesn’t seem like much research was done either. Btw, I’m not denying climate change or anything like that, I’m just saying it’s much more complex than “75% of the world is now desert, the other 25% is suddenly habitable and arable!”	UCMhWPH_uTivJKzL2FoecUjg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMhWPH_uTivJKzL2FoecUjg	0

Added to the melting glaciers, the oceans will warm and this is detrimental as cyclones will be MASSIVE (as seen in India LITERALLY right now). Also, the ocean currents will be completely remapped because of the warming ocean... This is why Geography is important!!

No Khanna did not make this map, and even if he did, he&#39;s not a climate scientist and not qualified to do so anyway. He says he got the map from a 2009 article in New Scientist. That article is blocked part way through by pay wall, but it looks like it was created by an environmental journalist. Without reading the article, I don&#39;t know the full context for the map, but the way this video presents it is very misleading. Anyone who studies climate knows it is extremely complex, and you can&#39;t just paint the whole map as desert. If the earth warmed by 4° C by 2100, we won&#39;t just turn into a desert instantly, there will be a sizeable lag and massive swings in climate over each region of Earth. It would be better presented as a reality far into the future, if we warm that much by 2100 and remain at the temperature or higher. On top of that, I have serious doubts that 2/3 of the world will become a desert, and it&#39;s extremely difficult to predict this. Instead of labeling places as a desert, instead low, medium, and high risk for unsuitable climate would be more appropriate. This video is infuriating that it presents something so serious without using a credible source and misleading folks. Maybe reach out to a climate scientist next time before talking about something you&#39;re not well informed on.	UCi11jaMTCPLQWlnnTEY6DhA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi11jaMTCPLQWlnnTEY6DhA	0

If it was less than 10°, the difference wouldn&#39;t be that widespreas. Plus we aren&#39;t going into global warming or climate change at the moment, we are going through a solar minimum so temperatures will decrease very minimally around ~0.3-0.5° lower. Most of climate change is a hoax since it won&#39;t happen until well into the 2100 or 2200&#39;s.	UCvIhi0KTD5NYdz3yOtEb6lg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvIhi0KTD5NYdz3yOtEb6lg	0

Even those better off weather-wise will still have to deal with massive amounts of people flooding into livable areas from the many places on earth that WOULD become uninhabitable. That much is still true at 4° change, even if the change is different than shown. Mostly a difference in moisture, and if you've ever dealt with serious humidity you'll know how awful it can be at higher temps.

You know, it&#39;s not like massive and great farmlands are lying beneath the ice, it&#39;s rock. You can&#39;t farm on rock. Arable soil is a product of thousands of years of dying organisms, not something that just shows up beneath melting ice.

No, I don&#39;t think that parts of Western and Northwestern Pacific ( East and Southeastern China, Japan, Taiwan, Philippines and Vietnam), Eastern U.S and Eastern India would be a dessert just like what the video claimed. These countries are within the typhoon belt and in case you don&#39;t know, typhoons (hurricanes in Atlantic Ocean and Cyclones in Indian Ocean) are formed because of warm and moist water. The hotter the water the more energy it has to fuel a typhoon. These places will see more typhoons than usual and when there&#39;s a typhoon, there&#39;s a rain and surely in this scenario there&#39;s plentiful amounts of it. So, these places won&#39;t surely be desserts. <br /><br />Just my 2cents.	UC2pyh2BNQAhmvK2MDZUhWfQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2pyh2BNQAhmvK2MDZUhWfQ	0

In facts in 2018, Indonesia should experienced the weirdest and yet the most devastated tsunami in the decade 2010-2019 (besides japan). one tsunami in September, struck the city of Palu which only took 10 minutes to reach the city (even 4 minutes in some parts of villages). Another one in December, the tsunami was not generated by earthquake, so it was not detected by our early detection system. And you know it, everything was gone. When more posts were popped up in social media, the government did not respond until 2 hours after the scene, un-aware that that was a tsunami.

It wont affect much of anything in nature. 4* cant turn a 75* norm into a desert. 79f is not desert temps. If you want to turn normal land into a desert youd need to gain 30*<br />It more. God damn i hate these fear mongering videos, all the morons fall for it and think its factual. So moral of the story is that a gain of 4c wont change our world at all.

Even with Corona it was the same, predicting doom then acting all surprised when Africa fared better than most other continents. I live in East Africa and let me tell all the region has been experiencing higher than usual rainfall for the last 10 years, and it is still rising. The only regions in Africa that are drying up are the Sahel and parts of Southern Africa, regions that have historical been dry. Even there mitigating solutions are being implemented like the Great Green Wall of the Sahel. So stop predicting doom and worrying about Africa, we are doing just fine and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future, instead worry about sea rise because you build all your cities on low lying costal zones.

Overall rainfall is likely to climb for this reason, although areas that rely on cyclical weather patterns (like Mediterranean climates) could see far more severe droughts until the climate reaches a new equilibrium. Modern desertification is primarily caused by deforestation and overgrazing (plant cover retains water, which then evaporates from the plant rather than flowing away as runoff), and while these things aren&#39;t fully independent from climate change, they are not an inevitable consequence of 4C of temperature rise in many areas.

The first thing first is when glaciers melt, those water must go somewhere, which obviously the ocean. Adding water to the ocean will result rising sea level which would push seas more inland than what&#39;s today (basically I&#39;m saying map would be different). The second one is more important, with different ocean shape and current, it&#39;s probably very likely those water evaporation from flooding sea would affect nearby climate to be more moderate, for example because of sea, Spain or is not as hot as deserts of Nevada/Utah because it&#39;s surrounded by sea even though it has same latitude, this become more apparent if you compare the latter with Japan or Korea.

Second: if this scenario were to be real, none of these countries would survive in their current form because of the massive migrations. And finally: the chaos the world would be would probably negate any attempt by any possible political entities to become super or even great powers, witch requires a great deal of resources and organization to manage, meaning the north pole, patagonia, new zealand and other small arable regios would probably form their own civilizations independently, similiarly as the americas and afroeurasian worlds were separated before colonization	UCsiGbi91sRPUAMfXkyT_6xw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsiGbi91sRPUAMfXkyT_6xw	0

The rising temperatures will create more, a lot more rain. the Yangtze and Yellow rivers won&#39;t dry up completely, but will probably become narrow strips of a liveable area similar to the Nile. the same with the Colorado and amazon river. unless the Coriolus effect stops being a thing or the Himalaya and Rockies disappear (I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m not sure what that Latin American mountain range is called.) the effect of the rains will lessen, sure, but not stop. it&#39;s the same around the Mediterranean. that sea creates a fuck ton of rain each year and will rain around its coasts. inland the rules change, of course. but around the massive body of water vegetation will remain.

It is, as the name says, developed. That means that they have infrastructure in place to effectively handle distribution of resources and goods. That&#39;s why deserts are still lived in and thriving in places like the US or oil rich Arab countries, but they aren&#39;t lived in very much in places like the Sahara. The balance of power will absolutely shift as countries like the US and China lose their arable land and need to import food from Russia and Canada, but they won&#39;t become completely abandoned.

Most Young inuits already want independence, and the country already govern itself. If the World heats up this much, they no longer need money from Denmark, so there is no reason for Them not to become independent. Furthermore, if Denmark tried to prevent their independence, Russia or the US would probably support Greenland inorder to get better control of arctic waters.

It will take hundreds if not thousands of years for it to grow crops. As well Russia, Alaska and Canada are not much better.When the permafrost melts you get muskeg. Water logged land with nutrient poor soil. Decades will be needed to make the soil able to yield good crops. On top of that the 4°C rise does nothing to make the growing year as long as further south. You still have the same number of hours of daylight as now. On top of that, in the winter, so instead of -50C you get -46C. Big deal. It is still damn cold, It will not turn onto the abundant mid-west overnight. <br /><br />As well, there is no need to relocate people. Cities of millions of people operate fine in deserts as long as transportation stays available. Over a million people live in Las Vegas and a similar number in Phoenix. a 4C temperature rise is still within what people can live in comfortably. <br />With solar and wind energy water can be brought in and once you have water and energy you can do anything. It would be easier to but a cover over much of the cities and leave people where they are. Like Fremont street in Las Vegas. <br /><br />As well such spread of deserts will be a slow process. It ill not occur suddenly.	UCZedpFV-ka3WDqLYk1zRpJQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZedpFV-ka3WDqLYk1zRpJQ	0

I also think that the U.S. government would be too stuborn too move out of Washington D.C. despite being a desert (because of history, Russia and Canada). The &quot;Green Place&quot; though is more plentiful maybe there would be massive underwater cities and eventually water world will become reality. Maybe the moon could be colonized; the rich will leave and live on Mars. Despite most of the world being desert in this scenario the United States could get a massive amount of energy from wind/ solar but this time from co2 capture, nuclear/ fusion power, and using other cleaner fuel methods. Despite all the hopes and dreams in this new world greed got too us thank those in power that didn&#39;t act for good and for the people but rather for money and power dooming future generations and the human race. Also lets not forget nukes would the superpowers of old be reluctant and unwilling too give up being the superpowers and launch nukes taking the whole world down with them over resources probably, or... maybe not, maybe we&#39;ll pull thru and prevail becoming a smarter species and learning from past mistakes. Despite this being a scenario and &quot;fiction&quot; it&#39;s possible we&#39;re headed for something similar though we&#39;re adaptable it&#39;s just that it won&#39;t be easy coming back though afterall we made it this far haven&#39;t We? It&#39;s just if we don&#39;t act now then what&#39;s too say humanity is doomed we&#39;re just too reliant on things that aren&#39;t sustainable and yes I&#39;m a hypocrite but still burning dinosaurs would eventually have catched up too us eventually. We must be careful, We can do it but... only 1 planet which is Earth and Earth has done us a good job keeping us alive so ya have a slow switch too cleaner methods of energy production, waste management and civilization.

I&#39;m speaking as someone with a Meteorology undergrad, who did climate-related grad-school research, and who is personally very concerned about climate change and it&#39;s impacts, and this map you&#39;re basing everything on seems pretty bogus. Would be nice if you based something like this off of a synthesis of actual research in the field rather than the crystal-gazing of a guy whose expertise lies in international relations, rather than the science driving the title of this topic. The authoritative voice you&#39;ve used in this video makes it appear that these are things the experts are actually claiming will definitively happen with a 4 degree increase, which is definitely not the case.

These area are and would be uninhabitable for more than just &quot;It real cold&quot;. Siberia especially eastern Siberia has some of the lowest rainfall records in the world resulting in Siberia being less like the great plains or the Russian steppe, and more like the Canadian Shield is today, a dry, desolate wasteland that just so happens to be temperate, due mainly to the prevailing westerlies pushing all the Pacific moisture East towards Alaska and not over Siberia. On the other hand most of North America would fair much better than today. Why? Thank the ice age. When the glaciers came down they removed all the topsoil in that area leaving only bare rock, which is not good for developing civilization. It would take thousands of years of erosion by both plants and rainfall to pulverize the surface rock into usable soil. Greenland would suffer the same problem. Only the parts of Russia West of the Ural mountains and Scandinavia would truly fit this fertile land of a superpower idea. Not trying to say your wrong, the base assumptions are right but geography is a lot more complex and my main point is that no one would really gain anything out of climate change in any way. That not even considering the intermediate political situation...	UCdXshdtyyn5V4Ojus7uSUIg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdXshdtyyn5V4Ojus7uSUIg	0

Antarctica has snow layers of 4000 meters thick, although it is a cold desert. The ice just never melts there and deep snow is almost a million years old. Precipitation is sometimes less than 1 mm snow per year. Extra snow just moves with the wind. (NOT FROM THE COAST HERE, since Antarctica in terms of height is like a dome with wind blowing down from the center to the ocean. These are called katabatic winds. The Siberian situation is different, with cold air coming from the North Pole. All other directions are shielded by mountains there. )	UC07rf3tS3pnZea1BtEkueUQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC07rf3tS3pnZea1BtEkueUQ	1	UgxXG8zoHNf6rwIbKtd4AaABAg	CJ Knoll

So there's a good chance it will end up that vast, dry, sparsely populated tundra. There's also a good chance that significant portions of the region will see slowly(on a human timescale) increasing rates of precipitation, leading to a climate that more resembles the northern US and southern Canada's plains and surrounding regions.

And in places where it's cold enough that most of that will come in the form of snow, it's also generally cold enough for that snow not to have a chance to melt. Especially in areas of permafrost, where the ground itself is completely frozen a decent way down. Even just a few centimeters of snow over the course of the year, year after year, will eventually build up until you get that snowy tundra terrain you're picturing in your head.

And as a comment above said, there is a huge difference between of gradual warming of the planet through thousands of years and warming of the planet within basically some 250 years. In the one scenario you have time to adapt, in the second one you don't have any time. Just imagine the floods of people, the relocation of most of Africa and India in a more lenient scenario, and I don't want to even imagine if the scenario where the only liveable area are some patches in the Sahel or the far north and south. Relocation of billions of people.	UCV3S7w3j9s8Z6Z7RzirZlXw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV3S7w3j9s8Z6Z7RzirZlXw	1	UgzHn5vrpTg549aN-1J4AaABAg	birdtower

Some years we get water shortages in the summer from lack of mountain snowfall in the winter before <br /><br />Most of the farmland in Washington is from the central and east side of the state. Central Washington is a desert, and the east end of Washington is semi desert. Summer temperatures in central WA average in the 90s F that often spike above 100F. The only reasons there is farmland here now is because of massive irrigation projects and the Columbia River that runs through central Washington. If the world got 8C hotter I can&#39;t see how any of that land could stay arable for long. <br /><br />Seattle would easily cripple under this scenario. Not to mention sea level rise that would likely put parts of the Puget sound lowlands underwater<br /><br />Alaska is looking pretty good though.

I don&#39;t see how in that scenario WW3 doesn&#39;t break out, and potentially leave nothing inhabitable. Best case scenario is an evolution in technology that makes current inhospitable areas livable. Would have to happen before Mars would ever be a plausible option.

The guy who wrote the book isn&#39;t a scientist/climatologist as far as I can tell (as others in the comments have already stated), so he really isn&#39;t a reliable source to begin with.<br />2. If the world warms up by 4 degrees, it won&#39;t &quot;just make everything a desert.&quot; Some areas will get less rainfall, but many other areas will get a lot more rainfall.<br />3. If the Earth warms by 4 degrees, climates will become more drastic and differentiated, not just all desert.<br />4. With a massive amount of cold water entering the oceans from melting ice caps, the ocean&#39;s currents will stop moving, which means many places, such as Canada and Northern Euopre, will actually get colder due to the lack of an ocean current bringing warm water and air south and taking cold water and air north.<br />5. This is definately the 100% worst case scenario, even if it could happen.<br /><br />If this video is based on the book, it isn&#39;t scientifically accurate, and even if it was, this would be a worst case scenario. This is based on the assumption that the Earth will warm 4 degrees, which is higher than the predicted average if we stay on track in terms of how fast we&#39;re transitioning to renewable energy. Some of the events in the video might happen to a small degree, but nothing near what is in the video. This is an interesting situation, but likely belongs in the realm of alternate history rather than &quot;this is definately going to happen.&quot;<br /><br />(By no means is this me saying this isn&#39;t an issue. This is an issue that we need to solve, and is probably the most important one long-term, but this video will scare people away from this topic and is probably doing more harm than good. We need to be reasonable with people, not scare them, and base our conversations in science and not &quot;oh my god we&#39;re all going to die.&quot;	UC4CJ9WBcOjQ-5CLdznVa2eQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4CJ9WBcOjQ-5CLdznVa2eQ	0

South America will likely see a rainforest collapse, but that is for multiple reasons, leaving the continent mostly Steppes, like in Argentina. Central America receives too much rainfall to ever become anything less than a tropic forest. North America’s Great Plains will likely become deserts, but anything past the Appalachians (ignoring flooding) will likely remain deciduous forest and plains. Canada and Russia will see their temperate zones expanded, one of the few parts of this map that are right, and Europe may actually become colder as ocean salinity decreases and the Gulf Stream becomes endangered, leaving the fate of Europe almost entirely contingent on that of the Gulf Stream. Sorry to talk all this shit, but man did this map fuck it up, if you want some better climatology I can suggest watching Atlas Pro’s video on the climate of Pangea.

The rocky, granite soil is poor for farming and also for construction of roads and infrastructure. Even if the temperature rises, the Canadian Shield would most definitely be uninhabitable due to the inhospitable geology.

A volcano or meteor can change the climate overnight in either direction. They start a lot of graphs in the little ice age. Because they want to show how hot we're making the earth. But that was the coldest the earth had been in 50,000 years so yes it's warmer than that.

Canada joining the union wouldn’t be that unlikely. Our cultures aren’t much different so it wouldn’t be too hard. Also it would just make more sense for the US to admit Canada. Anyway that map isn’t actually accurate. There was a time earth was a lot warmer and studies showed the earth was just entirely covered by Forests. So there probably won’t be large deserts where there are none. The amazon would probably become more of a grassland than a desert. The map is highly simplified and no one really understands how climate works and less predicting a hundred years in the future.

That&#39;s not what climate change has done in the past with 4 C of warming abruptly, or at that specific temperature. And some of those areas that you say will dry up their rivers should only lose their glaciers, not the rainfall feeding them. That means water will be erratic, not absent.

According to the International Desalination Association, 300 million people now get their water from desalination plants. It is completely possible for humankind to transition to desalination for its water supply. Yes, getting water from desalination is more costly than conventional means but it is not prohibitive.

Warmer oceans mean more frequent, more powerful hurricanes.<br />You&#39;d need to quadruple the increase, but you could also get hypercanes, with nice wind speeds &gt;800kmh (&gt;500mph). That&#39;s more than twice the worst hurricane ever recorded. And that&#39;s probably the cutest of the apocalyptic natural disaster we&#39;ll be dealing with frequently.<br />The good news is that we&#39;re not anywhere close to that. The bad news is that you don&#39;t need things to get this bad to cause immense damage to the entire world. spoiler: we&#39;re not going in the right direction.

Read from a climatologist next time please!<br /><br />Not even sure where to begin with this map, so much is wrong. For starters, Antarctica has been ice for 40 million years. The earth has been 8 degrees C warmer than today, on average, at least 4 times in that period with no ice melt. Also, lets talk deserts. Heat has almost nothing to do with desert formation, it is ALL about the precipitation. During ice ages, when less heat is around, MORE and LARGER deserts exist on average. During hotter times the Earth gets very humid, creating rain forests and jungles not deserts. Still not ideal for human life but a far cry from a sandbox like this seems to assume. It makes a lot of sense, more water + more heat = more evaporation. There also seems to be a massive amount of ignorance of ocean currents involved in this map. Not to beat a dead horse but Spain, France, and morocco will all basically become a rainforest due to the insane amount of moisture hitting the region. Greenland will actually become green, so not sure why there is only a small strip of green on it. Finally, trade. What the hell? You can go straight if there is no ice, no need to skirt Russia and Canada to trade, just draw a line and go.	UCYsRD_OxK0ac82nRBh1Mctw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYsRD_OxK0ac82nRBh1Mctw	0

The last time the temperature spiked by 5° to 8° C was during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, which peaked 55 million years ago. Until the beginning of the industrial age, we've been cooling ever since.

What if communities of tens or hundreds of millions form of say Chinese - and they declare independence in a South eastern part of Russia. The new China is founded inside Russian territory. I don&#39;t think Russia would allow for this to happen by implementing measures in advance - limiting how many people can come from any specific country and also spreading them throughout the country to minimise their unity and chance at sparking a war. Hence securing a Russian dominated Russia. Other countries could very much do the same.	UC3Uba097USpqgUJeRJDvodA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3Uba097USpqgUJeRJDvodA	0

So, who knows, perhaps they'll actually be able to beat them by then.	UCpAXmYdOnQoIQDxNBPSzDUA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpAXmYdOnQoIQDxNBPSzDUA	1	UgzSGBREWQl-LmrJ_t54AaABAg	Pimpmata

Our military is smaller, we have a smaller population, we have fewer resources. A large majority of our population lives close to the border. The problem is, if the US was to invade a country, other countries would use that as an excuse to invade aswell. Besides the map used in the video isnt accurate to what the planet will look like if it kept warming. Our military works best when we work with other NATO countries, we cant really do any large operation overseas like the US on our own.

I understand that people can believe that especially if they never feel the affects of it, but unfortunately there is countless scientific studies proving the prevalence of climate change and global warming. People like to argue that the 1-2 degrees Celsius increase in temperature from the 1800’s could be the cause of the technology giving people in the 21st century the ability to more accurately take temperature readings compared to the 1800’s, but then you can look at studies of the ozone layer diminishing at a significant rate from just the 1970’s where we’ve had the ability to spectrograph the atmosphere and take accurate readings of the O3 levels and see that they are reducing. You can even look towards the ocean levels which never really needed advanced equipment to gather data to see that they have risen at an exponential rate over the past 200 years. What do you think will happen these next 100 years if it continues on this exponential path? Entire cities, islands, even countries could be lost leaving people homeless and it’s your type of ignorance that leads to their lives being ruined. The only people that benefit off the belief that global warming isn’t real is billionaires that made their money through oil and fossil fuels and don’t want to waste the time to repurpose their stocks and finances into other long term business opportunities because they won’t be around much longer to deal with the repercussions.

Australia can be a major player, with New Zealand. You just looked at it and assumed &#39;not that big, it is tiny&#39; when that is literally the size of the West Coast in America. with The Pilbara, North Northern Territory and the Gulf of Carpentaria and Tasmania, you should not underestimate the sheer size that is that will house 25million people and a lot more refugees.<br /><br />tl;dr you underestimated the size of australia and australia can sure as hell still be a superpower	UCNfN_QuX3A9lMYYFSv4ZwBQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNfN_QuX3A9lMYYFSv4ZwBQ	0

If anything most Scandinavians are very much against such methods. There's a reason why many, especially in recent years have started to despise the United States here, and part of it is that "Pay to win" mentality. I mean remember when Trump wanted to straight up buy Greenland? A constituent country that's already working towards total independence! That was an embarassment to say the least.

And then simultaneously starry-eyed optimism with regard to human nature and immigration, integration of hundreds of millions/billions of people with a massive polyglot of languages and ethnicities... Yeah, there will be wars and new nations carved out. Greenland would likely NOT remain in Danish possession since there's an ocean in between and Denmark really doesn't have the military power projection to be able to hold it. USA probably would merge with Canada, largely peacefully but there'd probably be quite a bit of "localized strife" with that, plus hundreds of millions to billions of people clamoring to immigrate, and how would they be integrated? And so on. Yeah, this vid really only skips along some possible basic 1st order effects of the proposed scenario and ignores 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc order effects completely. Extremely naive. But a fun little thought experiment, all the same.	UCyD8VBdePWexljcOOiyLi2A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyD8VBdePWexljcOOiyLi2A	1	Ugy01QsHEyS7VSHAapZ4AaABAg	I Am Not a Catfish

They will assist nations like Canada, Denmark and Russia with resources and technologies in exchange for political influence, and even if they do not end up controlling every major issue on Earth, they will still be the main great power on the board. Furthermore, to ensure their dominance, they may limit all the interplanetary transport from Earth, effectively trapping the rest of mankind on the deserted and impoverished planet. Meanwhile, they will keep evolving and expanding, not only cutting the rest of the cultural bonds to Earth, but also using the bioengineering to transform their body and mind, becoming other species. The bloody war between Earth and the former colonies will probably ensue, and given the technological difference and the low value of human life on the planet (since global crises always destabilize government and lead to authoritarianism) , this way will culminate in hundreds of billions earthlings killed.

Claiming that the rainforests near equator will become desserts is not happening. Id you know the global wind system you’d know this is imposaible. It will aleays rain in the ITC-zone no matter how hot. It wil even rain more in the rainforests thanks to the higher temperatures which result in more evapuration in the subtropics leading to more rainfall in the rainforests. Again - not a climate sceptic - just know the truth of the global weather system - some og these desertification claims are simply untrue and misleading.

When the air gets to the equator it warms and go up in the atmosphere, at the same time the air in the poles become colder and goes down, this flow of air in the equator and in the poles is what makes the entire atmosphere flow. It works like a pump, pumping hot air to the higher and forcing it to go to the poles and cold air in low altitude to the equator. With the air water vapor is carried in clouds and that is why the equator is wetter, because both pumps find one another there and water, being heavier, becomes trapped, condenses and fall in the form of rain. It is a basic principle and it doesn't change, the Equator will always be the place on Earth with most precipitation, the only way to change it would be changing the angle of Earth's Rotation.

In the last ten years, the growth is still many, many orders of magnitude greater than all renewables put together. In order to merely stay under the +2°C mark between 1850 and 2100, we basically need to cut our emissions by 5% each year for the next 20 years - i.e. they need to start _decreasing_ yesterday, not increase slightly less quickly. We're doing exactly the opposite and renewable energy is quite literally nothing in comparison. They'll slow it down like I'd slow a train going at full speed by standing in its way.

Having more C02 readily available might seem handy in the short term, but it won't mean much if the same plants keep catching fire. It means crops we grow in certain regions will no longer be possible and so so so much more. Unfortunately nothing happens in a bubble, changes to the climate have like a domino effect that affects everything that interacts with it. Sure the fact C02 is more readily available for plants won't directly cause plant life to die off but the changes increased levels of C02 have on ecosystems will.

All he did was to describe that simple map and not much else and don't get me wrong, I really like this channel. Still, there are some misconceptions. First, that simple map it's not taking into account many geographic phenomenon that would change it big, but I guess it's to be expected, as it's difficult to predict... You pointed out many points so I won't do it... Just a minor fact that RLL didn't say. Russia has a port with navigable waters all year round in Murmansk.

To assume that it is as easy as Just move these People to a complitly New location and exspecting No social issues is naive. The reason why this type of mass immigration partialy worked in the New world was because most of the immegrants to the US and south Americas were White at that point. Getting different People, nationalities, religions and ideologies from All over the world and cramming them in to land that has never been farmed is not a good idea as i see it. Not to mention that most People of our generation dont even know how to farm. The best solution would Just be to take action now to avoid Getting in to All these problems in the first place.

Desertification will only occur in some equatorial regions in the instance of complete deforestation, which in some places is actually somewhat likely, but only some. And others, even in the event of total(or nearly total) deforestation will see more of a savannah/grassland sort of biome take over. Deforestation absolutely causes decreased rainfall due to loss of evapotranspiration in those regions, but oftentimes that rainfall reduction is in other regions that count on those forested areas evaporation to feed their precipitation each year. Long story short, the climate is complicated, the factors are complicated, and the effects of direct man-made change to different regions are complicated. Different biomes could see transformation(or just plain expansion instead) in one of a few different types of biomes depending on all of the other factors that coincide with the increase in temperature. This is why we use climate models to map the different possible outcomes based off of different starting conditions. There's no single possible resulting effect on any region on the planet and we need to know the best course of action to take to help each region of the planet remain what it was prior to the onset of anthropogenic climate change.

Although tropical deforestation meets some human needs, it also has profound, sometimes devastating, consequences, including social conflict and human rights abuses, extinction of plants and animals, and climate change—challenges that affect the whole world" It doesn't matter that places like the United States are replanting trees when A) a lot of those trees are going to take a long time to mature into the carbon sinks we need them to be and B) it's the rainforests that are actually the largest carbon sinks and what are actually what people talk about when they about deforestation and concern about tree loss and those are proven to being destroyed. Nevermind the fact that usually when people plant a bunch of trees it's usually all one species of tree which is terrible for a specific ecosystem.

Also note that significant anthropogenic deforestation efforts were already taking place over 4000y ago (along with the desertification/degradation of grasslands and the exploitation of many of the keystone creatures that stabilized these ecosystems), so while a comparison to 35 years ago may seem positive at first blush it misses an important portion of the trend. The larger picture is that we've stabilized at a far lower vegetative biomass than existed pre-civilization, that these temporary increases are only seen as plant populations drift poleward, and that this increase is nominal and shouldn't excuse more deforestation. Third, global reforesting efforts are woefully under-diverse, and are (generally) mono-crops developed by lumber industries to meet regulatory reforestation quotas and to feed future logging. These forests are pretty pitiful at fostering the ecological functions typical of endemic forests, far more susceptible to climatic and biological catastrophes, necessitate huge chemical and energy inputs for installation and maintenance and because of all this, they're (generally) not considered to confer any net economic, social or ecological benefit.

I believe that we should eliminate pollution or reduce it instead of 2 degrees why not make it 1 or .5 degrees. It would be safer for the planet. Also it will wreak havoc. I wish we can all reduce or eliminate climate change. We need to change the way we treat the earth rather than the opposite.

UgwgDsgI7k1QbJNYjaV4AaABAg	5	22	2020-05-19 20:47:39	Cadde	There&#39;s a whole slew of flaws in this video.<br />1) Rising temperatures doesn&#39;t automatically turn most of the world into a desert. It will mainly affect weather patterns to where what once was desert may very well become arable land because there&#39;s this thing called rainfall. And rainfall will ALWAYS happen somewhere. The reason we have deserts in some places isn&#39;t the inability for rain to fall there, it&#39;s because the way winds blow means these areas rarely get any moist air flowing over it and it&#39;s constantly locked into a high pressure zone.<br />If the jetstream shifts just ever so slightly, it&#39;s going to mean rain will fall on current deserts.<br /><br />2) Rising temperatures (in such small degrees) doesn&#39;t change the moisture level in the air for the worse. Dry climates exist exactly because most of the planet&#39;s water is locked into the oceans. With higher temperatures, more water will evaporate into the air. In other words, air will have a higher capacity to hold water the hotter it is and is the sole reason you get clouds. Warm and moist air rises into colder layers which condenses and falls back as raindrops.<br />A hotter climate means this happens more frequently across the globe. Again, what makes deserts deserts is the fact the winds that carry moist air around literally avoid the desert regions of the world.<br />Look at Norway, more specifically Bergen. They are pummeled year round by moist air from the atlantic ocean which is forced up against the mountains and so there&#39;s heavy precipitation on the western coast of Norway.<br /><br />3) The assumption that Greenland would still be mostly of arctic climate is laughable at best. In a scenario where average temperatures would rise by 4 degrees, all of Greenland would actually become green in short time. And so would most of the north pole.<br />Antarctica might still have some arctic climate though.<br /><br />4) &quot;Denmark would become a new superpower because they own greenland&quot;<br />That is even more laughable. They would lose their claim over Greenland in a heartbeat by other nations.<br />Simply focusing on Antarctica as a hotbed for conflict is quite weak. In a scenario where temperatures have risen by 4 degrees, such weak forces like the UN will cease to function completely.<br />Greenland will be invaded by whomever decides to start WW III first, which is inevitable in such a scenario.<br />5) If there&#39;s a demand, there&#39;s a supply. Ever heard of the movie Waterworld?<br />In short, people that have nowhere else to go will learn to live on the water. The Netherlands will build their cities Venice style. Floating on the water and their farms will be in large bags that also float on top of the water.<br /><br />6) You are of course also assuming mankind will even exists as it does today in 80 years from now. I am pretty sure we will have eradicated each other by then.	UCtekmeOTT4YFgR585seBQWg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtekmeOTT4YFgR585seBQWg	0

It’s true that the planet as a whole will be less habitable, but warmer temperature, thus higher evaporation, will not only make land dry faster and create desserts. All the evaporated water, especially from the seas must fall somewhere. And not all of it can fall in the far north or south, that is highly unlikely. <br /><br />Subsequently, there will be regions also closer to the equator with plenty of rain. Moreover, the higher levels of CO2 in the atmosphere will actually decrease the plants need for water (look it up).<br /><br />However, it is important to remember that the extra rain has the potential to fall in less pleasant patterns, with some regions drying up and others getting flooded. But with good geoengineering, maybe we could solve that problem somehow. What do I know? In a way it will actually be exciting to see how the world solves it all...

Basically, heat doesn&#39;t lead to deserts, it leads to jungles. 4 Kelvin increase is higher than most projections for the 21st century, and would likely see the elimination of the Sahara. Land has lower thermal inertia than sea, so during the day, wet breezes blow from the sea to the land, making things wetter.<br /><br />TL;DR: This is trash that makes people stop taking climate change seriously.

Desert countries will have a lot of sun and wind to desalinate ocean water and build vertical farms. But yeah, there wouldn&#39;t be a lot of the world where it&#39;s actually easy to live. I have little hope that our descendents will as comfortable as we are, and I think most of us, when we&#39;re older, will be reminiscing about simpler problems like COVID-19.

Last year, there was a heat wave that devasted North-west Europe and broke a record for the hottest temperature ever recorded in the UK. Probably also in the Netherlands and Belgium judging by their proximity. As well as that, in January Antarctica broke a record for the hottest temperature ever recorded on the planet and in the same month Norway broke a record for the hottest temperature reached during winter. I have just started doing research into weather and climate but all I'm saying is that the results I've found throughout this past year have been significantly higher than usual. It's weird how no one's talking about this spike yet so many people all over Europe have pointed out to me that they have felt it themselves. I don't know if this is the new trend for global warming or not but if it is we're screwed because I've never experienced such heat by a milestone. Anyway, just be aware that North America has a very unstable climate. Europe is always temperate because of the gulf stream so you will feel the mild changes whereas in let's say Wisconsin, it can be 5°C one day, the day after there could be a snow storm at let's say -3°C on average and the day after that, it's a sunny day at -15°C. This is why I prefer to study weather patterns around Europe. I just really hope this spike in temperature is only temporary. Only time will tell. To determine the climate of an area you need if I've not mistaken 30 years of research so that's gonna take quite a bit of time	UCkSJCkytTxIUvKc_oYakb8w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkSJCkytTxIUvKc_oYakb8w	1	UgzaK-hVxt_FjI_4NGl4AaABAg	HisMajestyAli

Last summer was extremely hot and dry, the autumn and winter rather mild and wet, with the coldest period taking place between mid/late November and early December. The rain stopped abruptly around the 11th of March, with extreme dryness until the end of April. With the way it's going, we should expect another year of record-breaking warmth this year...

I know a few Germans who have told me that Bavaria has gotten very little snow compared to last year. As well as that, Northern Germany only got snow on the 30th March, which is quite a weird date tbh considering it hadn't snowed before then at all. I grew up in London but I currently live in Italy because of family reasons. We have obviously had no snow here as Rome has quite a warm climate but I asked 3 friends from London if they had had any snow and they told me that they only got sleet towards the end of February. I know a Youtuber from Helsinki who said that the weather in Finland has been hotter than usual and they barely had snow. Some guy from Southern Norway also described this winter as hot and another one said it literally felt like autumn. A Youtuber from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania went to Upper Michigan to do an experiment by shooting snow and he said he couldn't do it this year in Pittsburgh because over there they had only had 8 inches of snow (this was January btw). He acted like it was nothing but I knew what was really going on. In my spare time, I also search up the weather in places around the world just for curiosity. Tbh, I wish I had plotted the statistics for different places throughout last winter. It would have been really interesting to check my results and compare them to the annual/monthly average. I should probably talk about how unbearable last Summer was but I won't because otherwise my comment would be way too long.

Being under massive ice sheets for so long, the ground is just gravel, no soil, so definitely no agriculture.<br />The UK and Danemark could also be greatly reduced depending on how much the sea would rise.<br />And I can only imagine what would previously permafrost-covered land (good part of Canada, Alaska and Russia) would look like, but again I doubt you could do agriculture there.<br />Basically you just focused on the temperatures and not on any other factors. You didn&#39;t even explain what&#39;s the brown on your map, is it desert or something else ? If it deserts, why a different color ?<br />I hope it&#39;s only a one-time drop in video quality...

Increased temperatures would cause faster and faster evaporation of oceans this would result in weather patterns like El Niño turning into a massive rain system like we&#39;ve never seen. At the same time its important to know that the last time we where warmer places like Canada supported massive forests but the rest of the world saw way more rain and therefore more rainforests. The world will turn green not yellow because the natural response to excess CO2 is to have increased plant consumption and a greening of the earth.

They did it with the Manifest Destiny when they stole all the land the USA currently occupys from Native peoples. They&#39;ll do it again with Canada and there&#39;s nothing Canada can do to stop it. <br /><br />As for Russia they can stop anyone from trying to take there land. Russia today is very strong and is more than capable of defending its territory. Russia would become a world power. Russia&#39;s power base would remain in tact. And they would only grow in power.<br /><br />After the USA annex&#39;s Canada the USA would remain a world power but would be weakened with relocating all its people to Canada/Alaska. Including its military assets and building new cities, bases and infrastructure.	UCYznJAjLAtqXdlX4lLT65DA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYznJAjLAtqXdlX4lLT65DA	0

It&#39;s too complicated to guarantee. This scenario makes no sense unless you think rain will just stop for some reason. History shows us deserts expand as the earth cools rather than gets warmer as the ocean stops evaporating as much.<br /><br /><b>edit</b> I can&#39;t believe you actually made such a flawed video non-ironically. For instance, parts of coastal Antarctica will be &quot;suitable for agriculture&quot; if it gets 4 degrees Celcius warmer. Maybe very very small parts of the antarctica peninsula will become barren tundra instead of ice caps... thats about it. And also you assume borders will remain as they are, laughable given the extreme scenario. Any weak country with good land would be obliterated as a political force with literally no doubt to that.

Rising temperature results in more evaporation, more capacity for the clouds to hold water and will not result in a complete desertification like this. The sea levels will rise, which means more water which can evaporate, which means more rain. Also, countries which have a coast line will lose land, but the land a little far from the current coast line will receive more rain. This video, again, is absolute bullshit.

UgwnBoEdbkXWMu0_mg94AaABAg	1	1	2020-05-19 19:00:49	Angelo Villones	I&#39;m no climatologist, but based on my basic understanding of climate science, most of the world is not gonna turn into a desert as a result of 4 degrees of warming. Sure there will be more deserts in the world with more intensive droughts, but those areas will probably stay around the areas that have high pressure atmospheric conditions already. As for the currently tropical regions, they&#39;ll receive more rainfall and more storms unless if the rainforests were chopped down. My overall point is that most of Earth won&#39;t become desert, but instead, the areas that have dry climates will become even dryer while the wet climates will be even more wet, either by rainfall or the ocean. It&#39;s just some constructive criticism that I want to give because, normally, the information from a RealLifeLore video is believable. But in this case, I have a hard time believing a lot of the data from his source, especially since it&#39;s not a well known source to me.

It is also factually accurate to say the period on record and before accurate record keeping the tree ring and Icecap records show a period of time we refer to the mid-evil warming period which more then likely led to the rise of the Vikings era, But thats neither here nor now I guess as thats almost ancient history. You can argue and be correct that CO2 is higher then in anytime in human history but to know how big of an impact the a miniscule amount of raise actually has as an effect on the climate is the argument that the skeptical people have especially when there is literally potentially hundreds of billions of tax payer money up for grabs. When you're talking about 100 parts per million of CO2 level raise it is a tiny amoint. Think about that for a moment in terms of money thats like having a million bucks and loosing a dollar or gaining a buck you're still pretty much at a million regardless of the direction. When we see things like inaccurate predictions such as sea level rise or time limits on how long we have left ( I remember Al Gore lieing to me back in 1987 how we would be under water and I definitely remember AOC telling me the end is in 12 yeara over a year ago. Then when these so called activist community that wants to close a scientific debate by calling rhose who don't believe a climate change denier that isn't science.

Also, the sahel would most definitely desertify and become a part of the Sahara desert. This map does not take into consideration all of the coasts that would become submerged under water. True, countries like Bangladesh would be submerged, however places like Florida and parts of California would also be submerged. Also, you greatly overestimate the sized if Russia as well as Canada, true they are huge, however, a flat map gives the illusion of larger landmasses near the poles. So meh...

Ask yourself, how can the amazon rainforest, with it's great river system and rain become a desert, while the sahel in africa that is already desertificating still be green? Nah, I find the map to be weak but still, climate change is a huge threat that will cause great suffering to humans and other living creatures.

All the evaporated water, especially from the seas must fall somewhere. And not all of it can fall in the far north or south, that is highly unlikely. Subsequently, there will be regions also closer to the equator with plenty of rain. Moreover, the higher levels of CO2 in the atmosphere will actually decrease the plants need for water (look it up). However, it is important to remember that the extra rain has the potential to fall in less pleasant patterns, with some regions drying up and others getting flooded. But with good geoengineering, maybe we could solve that problem somehow. What do I know? In a way it will actually be exciting to see how the world solves it all...

Canada, for example is massively underpopulated, but the majority of Canada is the Shield and very poor farmland. People have to eat, and this isn&#39;t even taking into consideration where the animals would go, and where the food to feed them would be grown.<br /><br />I haven&#39;t even touched on the extreme energy demands placed on these countries. The scenario presented here is the Hollywood scenario, where some people would be inconvenienced, but the human species will not only survive but thrive.<br /><br />This isn&#39;t at all what will happen.

The Vikings(now the Danish, Norwegians, Icelandic people) discovered Greenland(the south) first, back then the Inuit were only in the north or northern Canada. But I can only hope that Denmark is not going to give up the island of Greenland, it would be a great loss of land, ressources and just a gigantic mistake. Trump knows how valuable Greenland is... the US is trying hard via money to get more influence in Greenland RIGHT NOW.

Also I think much of what is said is just false. <br /><br />The Video makes it sound like after 3/4 of the world containing around 98% of its population becoming a desert is just something that will happen and is going to work out fine. The consequences that would have are barely mentioned. Just think about the wars that would be fought just for access to water and the billions of refugees dying at the borders of the last few remaining spots on earth left habitable. To think they would all just be able to relocate in Russia, Scandinavia or NZ is naive. Just think about how fast Europe shut its borders after just 2 million people trying to get in! <br /><br />What I think is falsely portrayed in the video is agriculture. I&#39;m not a specialist but I learned a lot about the effects of climate change and a huge part of that was the smashing of the dream of huge farms in Greenland or Siberia. Plants need more than just ok weather. To grow plants take nutritions and organic waste that is buried in the ground. That&#39;s actually what the soil is made up of. Anyway, the soil in Scandinavia, Siberia or Antarctica has been extremely frozen for thousands of years. The plants will simply not be able to grow there. The consequence? With most of the current farmlands being deserts and a huge displaced population we will have mass starving. <br /><br />Overall this video paints some kind of semi-optimistic picture that has given up upon trying to change that future. A focus on how we can prevent such a heating is truly lacking.	UCxnSECrQE7obYQE1TVFDT9Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxnSECrQE7obYQE1TVFDT9Q	0

What ani body with a remote nowlodge about raining patents could tell is very unlikly. Plus would sutch an increast heat not also increase the evaporation of the oceans especialy since the surface mase of the oceans have also grown? Shouldnt this than in turn lead to even more rain Fall and the creation of more rivers, waht would that in turn act against desertification!<br /><br />Ahhhhhhh and Greenland melts and finally gets Green! Just like the in the warm periot where the vikings settelt it. Awwww Man could we just know how the temperature was back that wenn they settelt it. Hmm taking in to consideration that today the southan Part is frozen and it wasnt back than? Maybe 4 degres more that today?<br />I dont know if this Video was a joke from the maker or some think?<br />But i really have the feeling that peopel se sutch scary maps were the hole World is a Dessert and they just stop thinking logicaly?<br />Soo peopel i implore you think more critical!

When the dinosaurs reigned Earth had no glaciers anywhere and was a supercontinent known as Pangea, and the bigger the continent the drier the inland regions. And while deserts were more plentiful than today it was far from a desert everywhere south of Canada. Those dinos had to have lived somewhere after all ;)<br />This is not to say it would be great, I am sure Climate Change will bring little good, especially the more dire projections but it would not be that terrible and there is no need to scare the people with outlandish scenarios. They will likely just reject it entirely while measured, realistic analysis might make them listen.	UCPPVnpL0V48iNRM3_0f6gcA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPPVnpL0V48iNRM3_0f6gcA	0

From what I&#39;ve read deserts probably won&#39;t spread that much, thought the effect on agriculture will be pretty much the same.<br /><br />The problem is that the scenario is completely unrealistic. There&#39;s no way any of the major powers will accept the new situation, so a global nuclear war is pretty much guaranteed. So with pretty much all of humanity gone much of the world will likely be covered in rain forests after the nuclear winter wears off.

Superpowers like China and India won&#39;t just do nothing while their country is falling apart from global warming. China would probably try to conquer parts of Russia so they they can basicly just move their entire country north. Meanwhile, US or other countries might be tempted to take over greenland, or even Canada. So even if some regions are theoreticly habitable...who knows after the large scale wars caused by them, which if the existence of a contry(like China would be) is at stake, have a chance of going nuclear.

First, countries that are currently very strong will annex large chunks of less populated northern countries in all likelihood. But on the climate notes, the Greenland Ice Sheet would certainly be on its way to a runaway melt, too small to be maintained. This would probably happen before Antarctica Western Ice Sheet thaws. However, both of these have issues that isn&#39;t addressed in this map. The land under the ice sheets of Greenland and West Antarctica are actually below sea level. This is why both are actually so unstable. Most on inland Greenland would become a large sea outlined by coastal mountains. Western Antarctica would be an archipelago.

Are you trying to make climate change look like a joke? This alarmism is exactly how deniers will be able to call actual science alarmist because of how unrealistic proposals like this are. This will never happen, and you’re only trivializing the serious issue of climate change by showing off a scenario that would never happen. The author of this book, by the way, is an economist, not a scientist. It is complete fiction and has no basis in reality. If you are using this as simply an alternate reality that won’t happen, that’s fine, but don’t present it as the inevitable future when all logic contradicts it. Come on. You can do better.

A +4°C change over JUST land results in a desert, but 70% of the surface is water! That water evaporates at crazy rates! More humidity, more rainfall! You look at the historical record and some of the most dense and widespread rainforests are from the hottest periods on Earth. Of course, we would not be able to survive this increase, as we have awful heat dissipation in hot and humid environments. This change would still be bad for us. But to say that the Earth would become a desert is misleading. It may be for a few hundred years while extinctions occur, but rainforest plants can and will colonize wet environments that suit them. We have to remember that coal and oil are formed from extremely dense vegetation. All that carbon was sequestered when the earth was a lot hotter than today.

Canada, New Zealand, and the Noridc countries are on these lists because they have low populations and progressive laws. I bet they will be able to cooperate to become a shared superpower because their similarities far outweigh their differences.<br />The rest of the world would be screwed unless they give in to any demands this new collective superpower wants. They will not want their land to be destroyed. They will not tolerate people who hurt or kill others over religious and political differences. So, be ready to play by their rules or die.<br />Russia? I have no clue what they would do.	UC6VaKFDZ-xgdfHBRB0UunFg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6VaKFDZ-xgdfHBRB0UunFg	0

UgxvuZ8H5JL-2q_2dmN4AaABAg	1	13	2020-05-19 17:24:00	John Smith	One thing to consider regarding farmland is that climate isn&#39;t the only factor in productivity. The amount of sunlight per square meter that a piece of ground receives is significantly lower in those upper latitudes due to the angle of the sun (this is a different than the issue of day/night cycles having larger swings which may or may not impact growth generally, I don&#39;t know). So just because things warm up in an area, that doesn&#39;t mean the production from arable land will be able to be used as a 1:1 productivity swap.

The amount of days this occurs depends on how far up north you are over the Arctic circle, and once you reach the north pole you find that the sun doesn't set at all for 6 months...

The developed world understands that cattle needs to be rotated, and a lot of the underdeveloped world is starting to rotate cattle too. Maybe the world will heat up a bit, but to believe that 4 degrees will turn the world into a desert is a bit shortsighted.

We aren&#39;t just going to up and die out of nowhere, and this map is terribly inaccurate. There will still be a lot of rainforest regions of the world and some new ones, and desertified regions will remain largely the same. The Congo Rainforest will most likely expand and become even larger, and same for the amazon, as increased ocean temperatures = more rain. Humanity has a near guaranteed chance of becoming a hyper-advanced civilization, and, with artificial intelligence, who&#39;s to say we won&#39;t find a material that has incredible carbon-capture technology that will reverse all effects of climate change?

UgyEYaRvKWJXA6bl9VR4AaABAg	0	0	2020-05-19 17:08:40	Kekero	I think this scenario ignores the fact that when the climate warms the water cycle becomes bigger. When the water cycle becomes bigger global temperatures actually will approach average not just straight up increase by 4 degrees. So storms and and hurricanes will become absolutely massive in comparison to today but on the bright side rainfall will most likely increase on average. <br />It’s just that it’s going to fuck over most developing countries.<br />Also take any predictions too exact with a grain of sand. Because we really do not have the tools necessary to predict what the world will be like. The only thing we know is that the oceans are going to get fucked hard. Ocean acidification is scary and warm water holds less oxygen so ocean life is likely to go through a mass extinction.

Global warming is very dangerous to Russia because a major part of it is built on permafrost which also contains a lot of methane. That melting down would be a catastrophe and while it might be a better place to live in the distant future, they would have to rebuild half of the country from scratch.

Reality of course would be much, much more violent and downright apocalyptic. It would be likely that Fascist regimes would spring up almost everywhere, either pledging to use their military force to keep starving people out or countries invading their neighbours to secure lush and habitable &#39;Lebensraum&#39; or living space for there populations to move to. Countries like the UK, Island, New Zealand and Australia would be in the best position to withstand the shocks to come. Mainly because they are island nations that are far easier to defend against than countries like Canada who is almost certainly going to be staring down another US invasion or Russia who has the prospect to keep out billions of starving Chinese refugees across thousands of kilometres of borders. Particularly with New Zealand and Australia is that they both reside in the southern hemisphere where only a tenth of the world&#39;s population lives and have thousands of kilometres of ocean between them and most of the world, they would be in the best position to survive into the end of the century.<br /><br />Another thing is that all that warmed tundra wouldn&#39;t be available immediately for agriculture. Arctic soils are acidic, poor in nutrients and are very thin. It might take thousands of years for a soil to form that could support crops. India and Pakistan would almost certainly go to regional nuclear war over the vanishing Himalayan river systems. But no matter how I say it, the world that is four degrees warmer wouldn&#39;t be able to support more than a small fraction of the human population that we have now.<br /><br />You read about Climate Change and few books and documentaries go to a four degree world or if they do, it is only lightly touched on to avoid turning off its viewers/readers. This is why.	UCqfjAfiH9z1fd-Xey4GIsBg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqfjAfiH9z1fd-Xey4GIsBg	0

Greenland DOES NOT hide alot of land under its ice, but just some mountain chains. Even in a 4° scenario Greenland would take over a thousand years to melt, revealing little to no farmable land.<br />3. If Africa would indeed move alot of people into the sahel zone, it would soon experience desertification aswell, cause it cant maintain the forest it needs while giving home to massive amounts of people. <br />4. It would be a bit naive to assume that all the migrants would be welcomed with open arms. More likely will there be fights for water and territory, protectionism and war.<br />5. Alaskas Oil wouldnt be worth shit, do you really think that in such an apocalyptic world the people of alaska would be like &quot;hey lets burn some more fossil ressources, has not hurt us in the past at all...&quot;<br />certainly more to critic, still thanks for informing about this important topic!

When you use them to try and predict past climates thousands of years ago they give crazy numbers that would end all life on earth. What if I told you we &quot;don&#39;t know&quot; magical little words. Most of what we do know relies on what we call &quot;settled science&quot; which is just a bunch of assumptions we have built are whole understanding of the world on layer after layer up guess work we don&#39;t even know what the sun is... Its most certainly not a nuclear camp fire in space no nuclear model even comes close to explaining everything we observe. Keep that in mind as we enter solar cycle 25 don&#39;t you just love how are sun is basically a clock.	UCG_QBMJmhej2gJOvzde3GeA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG_QBMJmhej2gJOvzde3GeA	0

A warmer Antarctica, Greenland, Russia, Canada, Alaska, and Nordic Peninsula would have improved crop yields from a longer growing season but new soil would take centuries to form.<br />Greenland and Antarctica at the end of the century may have open planes of rocks covered in lichens doing their best to form new soil but nothing approaching farm land. Likewise, the vast amount of frozen organic materials under the permafrost in the arctic will take decades to be converted to soil by natural decay alone.<br />Everything above could be sped up by human intervention but dollar for dollar we&#39;re better off simply trying to minimize climate change.

With the decreased sunlight, combined with the lack of river glacial melt and aquifer run-down, plus the fact that many of these regions have unsuited soils means billions would die-off if these extreme warming scenarios are allowed.

Poland would have to do a mass relocation to their North Coast, but I bet they&#39;d be alright. Australia would have to do a mass relocation/migration to the outback. Russia would be completely fine. I think if this happened, it would completely eliminate China as a world power, severely weaken the US, which would have to mass migrate to Alaska, and bring the boom of Canada, Russia, and the Nordics, and possibly Argentina down south, where I&#39;m assuming most South Americans would go.

UgyMN9O4bk3Io7IjvxB4AaABAg	0	1	2020-05-19 16:25:20	DM Reid	It&#39;s worth remembering that the vast disruption to the worlds eco systems will severely limit the amount of farming we will be able to do in the new habitable areas. Fishing will also be impossible as warmer oceans make species extinct if they haven&#39;t already been over fished. There may also be a drinking water shortage as glaciers in the Himalayas and other mountain ranges will disappear. These glaciers support billions of people today so it&#39;s difficult to think how a small bit of rain in northern Canada and Russia will be able to support 11 billion people. This video makes it seem almost okay especially if, like me, you live somewhere which will still be liveable then, but we mustn&#39;t get fooled by the happy little green farming icons because it won&#39;t be like that.

Ugz1WcBVncOF6_y5jj54AaABAg	2	1	2020-05-19 16:20:49	NightHunter571	If the world did get warmer then more water would evaporate leading to more cloud lowering the temperature and bringing rain. While deserts will increase I think most regions would see increases in humidity meaning plenty of vegetation. How do you think rainforests form, heat + humidity. End result less snow more sand, less temperate forest more rainforest. Also the whole Greenland and Antarctica thing is wrong there’s not much land under the ice and what is there is bare rock not arable dirt. All up I don’t think this video was properly researched and was instead the result of someone who got caught up in a line of thought and didn’t do any fact checking.

"ooh i found a flaw in his never-meant-to-be-taken-literally logic! now upvote me!" geez. obviously most of the video is oversimplification, guy never even bothered to explain how a "4C rise globally" would result in very different temperature gradients all over. in fact, pretty much zero meteorology/climatology was mentioned other than "this is gonna desert, that is gonna desert". one of you smug kids should just make a rebuttal video 20x as long and pedantically point out every little thing you disagree with - including how RLL basically used brown for submerged land lol.

Yes, all the things described in the video will happen to some degree. Desertification will increase and mass migrations will happen. But the nitty gritty is way more piecemeal than this broad-strokes map dreamed up by a dude whose expertise lies in foreign relations, not the science of climatology, and it was bad of @RealLifeLore to definitively claim all of the things in this video will absolutely happen based on a 4 degree increase like he has.

Islands are surrounded by water, thus have a temperate climate always. The fact that he says Japan will become a desert is laughably false. Japan will have a nice forest like Britain always! Oh by the way, rising sea levels aren't a huge deal because most of our land is above 100m. Old cities will drown, but new cities will be constructed on new coasts.

In Earth, the jet streams cause the equator to become humid, but in tern causes the surrounding area to be come arid (arabia, north africa, and the namib desert) This means that unless temperatures go up significantly (around 10 degrees, which would negate these effects and cause the whole world to be a jungle), the deserts would still increase in size.

This video seems to be looking for an extreme outcome of 4 degrees of warming, not a likely one. Temperatures increasing tends to actually make deserts smaller, unlike some people think, as the jungles/rainforests grow. Really, the concern with climate change is that animals and plants won't be able to adapt fast enough, not that most of the Earth will become an inhospitable desert.

You will see things about Lend-Lease, oil problems and stuff like that. U.S is now the biggest oil producer, but back then it was by far the biggest oil producer. U.S needed to help Germany and communism should have been defeated. It would have been better for Russia if Germany won.

The reason Germany lost is because of bombings the begun in 1940 and massbombings begun in 1943. Soviet-Union din't bomb Germany but the Western-powers. Germans never saw the U.S and Great Britain as their enemy. The difference was that Germany had Hungary and Italy (the most useless countries) as their ally and the Soviet-Union had the United-States and the UK as their ally. I think that's a huge diffirence	UC4ZYkFVEw2JEAGqrtUoUatA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4ZYkFVEw2JEAGqrtUoUatA	1	UgyWhwTVHbyscuFSDNZ4AaABAg	The Articulate Tree

It really doesn’t seem to take into account that rainfall generally increases as the climate warms as well. Yes, some places will desertify, but deserts won’t take over like this. The planet has gotten this warm before without deserts taking over. For example, look at the climate models for the Eocene. True deserts as we know them are in fact almost entirely gone, replaced by grassland, and tropical forests expand greatly, with temperate forests stretching all the way from the mid-latitudes to the poles	UCyUC-1KlRWEABBQ9UgUvqFg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyUC-1KlRWEABBQ9UgUvqFg	0

The energy yield is much higher & the perks are greater. They generate no waste at all besides water vapor & helium (both useful things), the fuel they use is hydrogen (the most abundant thing in the universe & with vast stores of the deuterium & tritium isotopes on the moon), they cannot melt down under any circumstance, etc. etc. Fusion is the perfect energy source, which is why we've been working on it for so long. It will also not be our solution to climate change, but as a long term energy solution, it is the absolute ideal & superior to thorium in every way. In the mean time, it will be solar, wind, hydro power, geothermal, conventional fission, & other clean energy sources that will get us off of fossil fuels & bridge the gap to fusion power.

And there's another even better energy source that's also being researched & is showing very promising progress: fusion energy. As far as the long-term is concerned, fusion is essentially our magic bullet for energy production, & once we perfect it there will be no other power source that's even close until we start doing truly crazy scifi stuff like using black holes to generate power.

UgzZ2ELwpHNjCHCyB7Z4AaABAg	1	2	2020-05-19 15:57:51	Tristian Capozzi	I&#39;m a bit skeptical of this map&#39;s predictions. I haven&#39;t read the book it was taken from, but it seems that all the author did was take the existing climate zones and shift them a number of degrees of latitude towards the poles. This seems overly simplistic and differs from other models of climate change I have seen. Does this model account, for instance, the disruption to ocean currents caused by a decrease in ocean salinity due to ice melt, or for the increase in atmospheric water content in a warmer, wetter world. Additionally, I don&#39;t believe that sub-polar regions would suddenly become hospitable for agriculture even if they were warmer, because they would still receive relatively little sunlight year-round, so it would be a challenge to farm there. I&#39;d love to know what methodology was used to make this map.	UCYk3UUQm0dA6ZdwPeNwN30w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYk3UUQm0dA6ZdwPeNwN30w	0

Warmer climate would likely lead to longer, wetter monsoons in India and the Amazon&#39;s, which would make both habitable. Also, the author has completely forgotten about the way the world looked like in the PETM. Most people forget, but Humans have been living in one of the coolest eras of geological time. The early palaeolithic had temperatures 4 °c warmer than today, and that created the green Sahara. The PETM was 14° warmer than today, and it was filled with tropical rainforests. The point is, the warmer the world, the wetter it gets. Which will mean huge rain fed rivers all over the place.	UCzt2erKowrR1T6iffqw9lrA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzt2erKowrR1T6iffqw9lrA	0

In reality, NASA has found the earth to be GREENING with the increase of temperatures and carbon emissions. This makes sense, as carbon dioxide helps to sustain plant life and warmer temperatures help to sustain rainforests. More warmth doesn&#39;t mean more deserts.

The desert line right on the US/Canada border is hilarious. <br />The idea that climate change would suddenly transform Siberia into a highly habitable land is also ridiculous, climate there has little to do with global average temperatures and more with it being a huge plain piece of land, climate change is not going to change that. Make it warmer? Sure. Fertile for agriculture? No. <br />All in all have to wonder why use this outrageous map as a reference, when there are far more detailed and accurate predictions floating around in thrives.

UgzdnTQaiVztI4uVPcJ4AaABAg	0	1	2020-05-19 15:42:02	-	Your analysis is flawed. You talk about northern countries becoming super-powers due to their ownership of currently-frozen, later-habitable land, but that&#39;s specious. In this doomsday sceenario, those countries would not become super-powers, rather, they would be attacked and invaded by the rest of the world. Obviously the US would invade and conquer Canada and China would invade and conquer Russia. Scandinavia would probably get taken by Russia as a backup from China&#39;s attack. The biggest problem however is nuclear war between Russia and China…<br /><br />For anyone thinking that everyone would simply move to the currently-frozen areas and no big deal, that&#39;s not true. A 4° increase in global temperature wouldn&#39;t just cause ice to melt and sea-level to rise, it would also cause a tremendous amount of bad weather that would ravage everywhere. (Besides, what good is moving if 90% of the planet is wasteland? ¬_¬ You don&#39;t see post-apocalypse movies about people being fine with things the way they are, they&#39;re always hoping to restore the planet to the way it used to be.)

During this period the earth exploded in speciation and new lifeforms. Tropics extended into the Alps. The polar caps melted and water and consequent rainfall was substantial. The seas warmed up to 10 degrees and hurricanes were prevalent. But noooooooooo. Modern psuedo-scientists don&#39;t think raising the temp 4 degrees will have the same effect it already had once before and instead want you to believe the earth will turn into a desert, ignoring the fact that all that melted water from the polar caps has to go somewhere. Use your god-given brains for once and ignore these progressive idiots. Fake news, people. Fake news trying to get you to ignore history so they can tax you to death.

Siberia&#39;s soil is thin, acidic and largely unsuitable for agriculture, the same goes for the Canadian and Scandinavian arctic. Efforts to farm Iceland resulted in most of the country&#39;s soil eroding away in the middle ages. Antarctica and Greenland have no soil at all under their ice-sheets. It takes at least 200 years for enough soil to form to support lage-scale agriculture. Any effort to farm these areas before topsoil can properly form would have the same result as Nikita Khruschev&#39;s virgin lands scheme.<br />There is also the fact that there is absolutley no way states could survive and be organised enough to carry out a programme of resetlement and colonisation in this scenario. Consider the political chaos that has ensued as a reuslt of a few million Syrians being displaced (the Syrian civil war was partly triggered by cliamte change BTW) now imagine what sort of chaos would reuslt from the entire population of China, most of India, all of Bangladesh nearly all of Latin America and most of the United Sates having to up sticks and move. We are looking at perhaps five or six billion people being relocated. Consider how our society has ground to a halt when faced by a pandemic that, compared to most plagues throughout history, is extremely minor. There is absolutely no way human civilisation is surviving in a four degree world.	UCszZLYAdCHnVW9Op2J4Lh2g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCszZLYAdCHnVW9Op2J4Lh2g	0

I could see China doing the same to Russia. I wonder if the Europeans would invade northern Africa and the north west Middle East to build fortresses and bases to prevent a super bad migrant crisis from overwhelming Europe and setting up ships to ship trespassers to Western Antarctica in mass. I also wonder if they would officially merge into one or more nations instead of the 45+ they have now.	UCtpfFBbKp6btpE4OB3108GA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtpfFBbKp6btpE4OB3108GA	0

It takes much more than temperature to create a desert, the biggest factors are constant high air pressure (due to trade winds) and high mountain ranges. I&#39;m not even gonna try to explain why this is wrong on so many levels, 4 degrees warmer temp. rise won&#39;t make most of the world a desert, and it definitely won&#39;t make -20 degrees areas habitable.

Kilometers , Liters and patrol vs Miles , Gallons and Gasoline !<br />The old great game may play out itself again between the British empire vs Russia in which all those 4 Nordic countries will simply fall in line for the Queen/King due to Russia&#39;s intention to swallow them and USA will be gradually reduced to 2nd in command in global affairs due to fall in productivity ! <br />On what side will Germany chose , will mean some more leg room and head space for any of the bloc it may choose to go !<br />UK as a historical and traditional country have all the necessary experience and skills required for successfully running an Empire on a truly global scale unlike others !

Canada is lucky if it avoids suffering the fate it did in the "Fallout" games. I mean how can ANYONE say with a straight face that the UNITED NATIONS could intervene ANYWHERE in such a situation? They would be the FIRST institution to go. What is going to happen is that the current powers will fight the potential future powers. Canada will either be brutally annexed or merge with the US. Then they might take Greenland too, or Europe will cut a deal and backed by the French Nukes they will take Greenland China and Russia will get into a massive war. Because everyone will want what Russia has. There might be civil war in Europe around the resettlements of the muslims of the middle east. A religious war, leading to widescale genocidal extermination of whoever loses is quite probable. Out of pure convenience it is actually not impossible for white supremacy to become the dominant ideology, as it unites those having the good land against the desparate and taken to its brutal conclusion still "only" requires the nations to exterminate (because let´s face it expulsion equals death) parts of their populations that they could theoretically live without. YES, it can get THAT bad and it still gets worse. Russia might pursue a pan slavic state, taking in much of eastern Europe. That could actually go smoothly enough. Japan will invade Russia again and try to claim a piece. Possibly, Russia might straight up first strike nuke China or make some deal with Japan and south Korea to give them parts of eastern siberia instead. Or they might ally with China instead, that could be a viable option too, which would now lead to Japan dying off. The point in the end is, there will be no peaceful resettlement in this scenario, no humanitarianism, there will only be land and those with the power to take or defend is. The strong will take what they can get, the weak will suffer and die. Humanity would likely still go on, but the world would never be the same and calling the conflicts "world war 3" would give one a false reference for the few tens of millions dying in the last world wars. BILLIONS will die.	UCQXbTRcUBWTXRJeklqZypJg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQXbTRcUBWTXRJeklqZypJg	1	UgxyiaPPtEYRq5GuN9d4AaABAg	Stefano C.

Making the global north which would then be the most fertile region look way bigger than it is kinda downplays the severity of that scenario. Also I don&#39;t really get why the tropical and subtropical regions would become so dry. The evaporation of the tropical ocean would be extremly high with a 4 degree increase, where should all this moisture go instead of the inner tropic convergence (I hope that&#39;s the word in english :D).

There&#39;s already plenty of idiots involved in the climate debate, there doesn&#39;t need to be more people running around claiming with certainty that &quot;this and this!&quot; will happen because that not only misinforms and discredits the movement as a whole, it&#39;s misrepresenting the fact that we have no wholly or accurate models of what is going to happen, a fact that in of itself is terrifying and should be reason enough to get active about these issues without needing to blatantly make shit up.

Most of the territories that are mentioned as &quot;becoming green&quot; here have neither – under the ice there is just rubble or permafrost-ground that will need centuries to become fertile. And half a year of darkness in some of the mentioned areas do not help. <br />So, no, even the areas that benefit will not become the breadbaskets of tomorrow.

Pangea was hot, but it was also really humid causing the supercontinent to be mostly jungle, with the interior being a desert due to lack of rainfall.

If this actually happened today, all that will really change are coasts getting flooded, a comparatively small disaster compared to the chaos talked about in this video. Also, keep in mind that earth a few million years ago was several degrees warmer and only the center of Pangea was a desert. So yes, the book and video here are a joke.

Ugzzrop9McvZ3PSybpl4AaABAg	0	2	2020-05-19 15:08:08	KK	I have to admit this video is very poorly researched:<br /><br />1.If the world heats up by 4 degrees then sea level rise would alter the coasts of every continent so there would be much less land available(rendering your map inaccurate)<br /><br />2.Antartica is also really just a lot of islands, not a continuous landmass. This means your final point is also wrong(or at least wrongly animated) as not all of the ice shelf will be land in that scenario.<br /><br />3.Great powers would just annex new territories if their homeland becomes uninhabitable(Eg America annexing Canada) but this is hard to predict so I understand why you pretended it wouldn’t happen(but you should have mentioned these possibilities)<br /><br />I hope you can take my advice and make better videos in the future	UCLuxGhtMWH5ZPcHMAG3DoHA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLuxGhtMWH5ZPcHMAG3DoHA	0

Europe will actually become about 4 degrees colder if the effects of climate change continue. Right now the North atlantic current transports warm water from the caribbean to europe, which is why europe is a lot warmer than north America on the same latitudes. This current has shut down in the past, and is showing signs of doing so again. The culprit: melting ice. So if if keeps getting warmer, more ice melts, and europe will become 4 degress colder instead of warmer. Not the only thing the video gets wrong. The sahara will actually become green again if the temperatures increase instead of growing into the rest of Africa and Europe.

When the earth gets warmer, it translates to more condensation, which creates more rain. expanding the tropical rainforests and savanna up north and down south.<br />2. The wind patterns/currents. The reason there’s the Saharan desert in the first place is because East Asia blocked the rain from passing into the Middle East and Northern Africa. <br /><br />Which means that the desert will not expand to encompass the entire world. But it will move more north or more south depending on its hemisphere. Which means that the Sahara will be more habitable in the south and Europe will get even dryer.<br /><br />And there’s a couple more things I want to mention.<br />- Why is there a rainforest in the middle of the deserts with no savanna as barriers?<br />- Why is there a desert divide along a perfectly straight line.( like the US Canada border)?<br /><br />fyi I’m not an expert in this and I’m not native English speaker, so...sorry for some grammar mistakes but it feels like this whole video is weirdly more wrong than normal. I really hope this isn’t some sort of r/wooosh thing that I don’t get.	UCp5UoXhHLN2TTlnHJNUtp6w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp5UoXhHLN2TTlnHJNUtp6w	0

Plus the U.S will probably just end up forming a union with Canada in this scenario so Canada can have access to various old American resources. So Canada becomes a dominant military power while a large portion of Americans move northward. Though assuming no borders or new states are popping up in this scenario, here's the probable ranking: 1. Russia 2. Canada 3. Denmark 4. New Zealand 5.

I can clearly see the rise of British empire once again while USA's power will be reduced to 3rd best just behind RUSSIA and it will be playing the same secondary role just like Australia , Canada or NZ performs for the USA against China or any other adversary but now on reverse order ! Now why UK will becomes the most powerful country in the world again ?! Good question you ask ! Remember all those country like Australia or NZ or Canada or Ireland including UK itself turns into a green habitable zones , turns out to be that the Queen of England , is still the Queen of all those three countries I mentioned above (not USA and Russia obviously !) and they are more culturally and systematically close to England than the USA itself ! Ex. Kilometers , Liters and patrol vs Miles , Gallons and Gasoline ! The old great game may play out itself again between the British empire vs Russia in which all those 4 Nordic countries will simply fall in line for the Queen/King due to Russia's intention to swallow them and USA will be gradually reduced to 2nd in command in global affairs due to fall in productivity ! On what side will Germany chose , will mean some more leg room and head space for any of the bloc it may choose to go ! UK as a historical and traditional country have all the necessary experience and skills required for successfully running an Empire on a truly global scale unlike others !

It means the average annual temperature for every place on Earth rises by x°.<br /><br />I know that sounds confusing so here’s an example: The average annual temperature of London is only a few degrees less than the average annual temperature of Istanbul, even though Istanbul’s daily temperatures are much higher than London’s by more than just a few degrees<br /><br />It’s only when you look at averages across a geological scale where a few degrees makes a big difference	UCjbUWc7nqdCss1UmRQkvUcQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjbUWc7nqdCss1UmRQkvUcQ	0

You based it on one single map, which is not only very imprecise but also seems to ignore the effects of things like mountain ranges, ocean currents and other things. Also, the areas marked as submerged by the sea seem arbitrarily chosen. A lot of land that would be underwater isn&#39;t marked and some areas in red will probably not be submerged. I don&#39;t know where this map&#39;s creator got it&#39;s sources from, but they seem pretty bad. It&#39;s really no wonder if you look at the author of the book - he has absolutely zero background in science. Of course, this channel is meant for entertainment, but a video about such an important scientific topic should rely on more than that one book from that one politician. I think he has absolutely no idea what he&#39;s writing about. Sorry for the harsh criticism - but this is the internet afterall ;)	UC-ezlLecu-A7UyqYrcf07tg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-ezlLecu-A7UyqYrcf07tg	0

No, an increase in temperature don't make the earth drier. It increases evaporation, thus rain. Our water come from the sea, not the continent.

In addition, the policies of climate activities such as not burning fire breaks exasperated the issue, making them much worse(more CO2 doesn’t make a fire bigger; perhaps the plants were drier, but fire breaks would have helped tremendously).

Not saying this wouldn't be terrible. Most of the world would be subject to tropical diseases like Malaria and massive flooding would happen. But heat doesn't make desert... Not at all, as long as there is humidity you can have plant life. And the humidity doesn't just disappear because the climate warms up.

Because all the moisture is trapped in the poles. So I'm pretty sure when the world gets hotter, the climate would technically get wetter. I'm just basing this one what I know about the history of Earth's climate. Dunno whether cities existing may change that.

Surprisingly plants need more than just CO2 to survive (I know, crazy right). They need water, nutrients, sunlight, iron, zinc stuff like that. It is true that right now some biomes are having a positive effect from the CO2 eutrophication but these will turn into a CO2 source in a few years because of a rise in forest fires and such. Once an area hits the limit of one of those limiting resources (Just 1!) they wont gain any more benefit from the added CO2.

UgwNGT01Rz9cm6boFNp4AaABAg	0	2	2020-05-19 14:47:10	SuperThunderGoodGuy	Global Warming is real and needs to be addressed. We have warmed the planet by 1.1°C so far yet we have seen terrible effects already from extreme storms, heat waves, and droughts. A 4° to 5°C rise would be terrible. Sea levels will rise by 2-4 meters, we will sea mass extinctions and more. The current Holoence Interglacial climate is what gage rise to civilization, coupled degrees warmer, humans can’t survive. A good way to look at the current warming is by looking at the PETM 56 million years ago, Earths temperature rose 5-8°C in 20,000 years. Tropical Rainforests covered the Arctic while extreme desserts covered the equator, life even than was hard for life recovery from the extinction that wiped out the dinosaurs. Than CO2 was being put in the air at 0.1 ppmv per year, now humans are pumping CO2 at 3 ppmv per year. Current CO2 levels are around 415 ppmv by 2100 that could be 1,000 ppmv similar to the PETM. <br />The debate wether humans are causing global warming is over. We know it’s real, we know humans are causing it and as a student studying the science in school now and sickens me that people deny science. The Anthropocene is here, it’s time to take care of it. Science is real, denial can’t happen. <br />I live in the New York Metro Area and we are seeing more extreme coastal flooding, extreme heat waves and more hurricanes. I’m the future, rising seas could wipe out my area and millions will have to relocate.	UCNrXngTy7SQf0tDWQ88qefQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNrXngTy7SQf0tDWQ88qefQ	0

On the point of the Chinese military, under this scenario there is no reason to not just nuke the whole place. With Russia's massive army and the USA's massive military combined, I'd think they would stomp anyone to the tune of 6,000+ nukes. After all, Russia would be fighting for its survival as everyone would want its land; while the USA would be fighting to take land for itself (Canada). Any alliance would be solely for preventing MAD as both waged their own wars for survival.

Since we are doing next to nothing right now, any little but helps. I know more than just this would have to take place if we wanted to do something.

Their combined might would work to subdue the rest of the world. This balance is dependent on how aggressive Russia and USA are though. US would need to annex Canada and Russia would like the US's might to repel the crap tons of refugees. USA would wage an offensive war and Russia would wage a defensive one.

I can clearly see the rise of British empire once again while USA's power will be reduced to 3rd best just behind RUSSIA and it will be playing the same secondary role just like Australia , Canada or NZ performs for the USA against China or any other adversary but now on reverse order ! Now why UK will becomes the most powerful country in the world again ?! Good question you ask ! Remember all those country like Australia or NZ or Canada or Ireland including UK itself turns into a green habitable zones , turns out to be that the Queen of England , is still the Queen of all those three countries I mentioned above (not USA and Russia obviously !) and they are more culturally and systematically close to England than the USA itself ! Ex. Kilometers , Liters and patrol vs Miles , Gallons and Gasoline ! The old great game may play out itself again between the British empire vs Russia in which all those 4 Nordic countries will simply fall in line for the Queen/King due to Russia's intention to swallow them and USA will be gradually reduced to 2nd in command in global affairs due to fall in productivity ! On what side will Germany chose , will mean some more leg room and head space for any of the bloc it may choose to go ! UK as a historical and traditional country have all the necessary experience and skills required for successfully running an Empire on a truly global scale unlike others !

UgzMZpcMxB0yDEHMQWN4AaABAg	1	1	2020-05-19 14:40:57	DiMack	I find this supposition odd, as with warming temperatures we see an overall average increase in rainfall. Desertification is a process largely caused by global cooling since more water gets sequestered in the icecaps and glaciers. In global warming, those glaciers melt, the seas rise, cloud cover expands and rainfall increases. Some deserts would expand, but most deserts would actually shrink since that higher rainfall and more active evaporation over larger oceans would result in a hot, humid earth and many areas would find relief from high temperatures through cloud cover.<br />Edit: This map also largely ignores changing ocean currents (bringing humid air to vast regions) and rain capture and rain shadow effects caused by mountains.

It comes from fossil fuels, since energy can not be created nor destroyed it has to come from some place else. So electric cars actually have the same carbon footprint as regular cars and are slightly more expensive. It is a shameful scam. If you like electric cars, fine I also think they are really cool.

Look at the Ice Ages for a reverse of this. There were points in our history where the Earth was a snowball, and there were points where there was no ice at all. Humans only had the power to affect the climate in the last 200-300 years, so who put all the greenhouse gases in the air millions of years ago? Again, we can affect the Earth, but Mother Nature can do a hell of a lot more then us.

UgxNzs4tHULCgpLRsjp4AaABAg	1	2	2020-05-19 14:36:09	Cindy Rose	I hope this blesses someone...<br /><br />What ever hardship you are going through, please know God has not forgotten you, He loves you and is there for you. Just turn to Him. <br /><br />Did you know that God loves you very much? You are His precious creation. He knows everyhing about you, the good and the bad. God desires you to come and talk to Him and for you to find rest and peace in Him. God created you to love and for you to love him. He wants you to spend eternity in Heaven with Him. That is why he sent His Son Jesus Christ to save you. Jesus paid your sin debt by willingly dying in our place. Now that is true love! Jesus is alive...He conquered death and he is coming back very soon. Please receive Jesus Christ as your Savior today...He is the one &amp; only Way to Heaven.<br /><br />WHAT TO DO:<br />Just go to Jesus Christ with a humble heart, repent and put your trust in Jesus as your Lord and Savior, committing your life to Jesus.<br /><br />AN EXAMPLE PRAYER:<br />Jesus Christ, I come to you a sinner, I repent of living my life away from you and ask for your forgiveness. I believe you are the Son of God, that you went to the cross, died in my place, paying my sin debt and that you were buried &amp; rose on the 3rd day to everlasting life. Jesus, right now, I choose to receive you as my Lord and my Savior, trusting in you alone for my salvation. I surrender my life to you and ask for your will to be done. I invite your Holy Spirit to come into my heart to make me more like you. Thank you for your forgiveness. Thank you for filling me with the Holy Spirit and for your gift of eternal life in Heaven. Amen!<br /><br />NOW WHAT:<br />Being a Christian is all about relationship. You grow in your relationship with God as you spend time with Him, in your Bible, in prayer, in time of worship and praise. I suggest reading the gospel of John first, and then read the books that apostle Paul wrote, Romans through Philemon.

I can clearly see the rise of British empire once again while USA's power will be reduced to 3rd best just behind RUSSIA and it will be playing the same secondary role just like Australia , Canada or NZ performs for the USA against China or any other adversary but now on reverse order ! Now why UK will becomes the most powerful country in the world again ?! Good question you ask ! Remember all those country like Australia or NZ or Canada or Ireland including UK itself turns into a green habitable zones , turns out to be that the Queen of England , is still the Queen of all those three countries I mentioned above (not USA and Russia obviously !) and they are more culturally and systematically close to England than the USA itself ! Ex. Kilometers , Liters and patrol vs Miles , Gallons and Gasoline ! The old great game may play out itself again between the British empire vs Russia in which all those 4 Nordic countries will simply fall in line for the Queen/King due to Russia's intention to swallow them and USA will be gradually reduced to 2nd in command in global affairs due to fall in productivity ! On what side will Germany chose , will mean some more leg room and head space for any of the bloc it may choose to go ! UK as a historical and traditional country have all the necessary experience and skills required for successfully running an Empire on a truly global scale unlike others !
