If you plant more trees then there will be even less CO2 for the plants needs and global growth will slow again. The Vostok ice core data clearly shows that CO2 levels were much higher in the past and life as a consequence was much more diverse and plentiful.

You start with a premise that climate change Activism is just fear mongering and Hoax. When Climate change activists explain their concern in a detailed article, instead of challenging their evidence you simply denounce them because they are presented by climate change activists to prove your point that climate change activism is hoax. Your Premise and Conclusion are same. With this moon logic it‚Äôs impossible to have a rational discussion because everyone who agrees climate change is real is an activist and therefore shouldn‚Äôt be listened to. That only leaves people who say climate change is a hoax. In other words, you are saying you‚Äôll only change your mind if a climate change denier says climate change is real. That‚Äôs a logical contradiction. If he says it‚Äôs real he becomes an activist.

Molecules respond to certain wavelength of electromagnetic radiation. They absorb it and then re-emit it. Earth receives low wavelength radiation from sun which supports producers in food-chain and they release high wavelength radiations back in space. The difference between the energy of low wavelength light and high wavelength light is what‚Äôs stored in plant cells. The emitted radiation has to travel through atmosphere before escaping into space. The greenhouse gases in the atmosphere act like hurdles for these radiations by constantly absorbing and re-emitting them thus making it longer for them to leave Earth. If more amount of greenhouse gas is present in the atmosphere it will take longer for infrared radiations to leave Earth and Hotter our atmosphere will be.

Climate is an equilibrium between various natural process. A sudden addition or elimination of a variable will completely alter the equilibrium. Human civilisation is directly dependent on the better predictability and early warnings of climatic events. What is causing Climate Change? Global Warming. Climate has changed slowly and gradually for as long as there is Earth. For 200,000 years that humans have existed, the globe has become slightly warmer. But since the Industrial Revolution, a sudden increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration has accelerated the process to an unmanageable degree. As a result we are observing extreme weather events around the globe which will only get worse if it‚Äôs not controlled now. This sudden change in Climate also leaves very less time for species to adapt and evolve into new habitat. Consequence is that species are disappearing at 1000 times faster rate than they were in previous 5 Mass extinctions. Hope this clarified your confusion with the terms. https://climate.nasa.gov/resources/global-warming-vs-climate-change/ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_extinction https://www.un.org/en/sections/issues-depth/climate-change/	UC10bf6jivR9FfxNrQ9RZx-w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC10bf6jivR9FfxNrQ9RZx-w	1	UgyPFmO-1Bk3m1rOVEd4AaABAg	Victor Garcia

I am not funded by the fossil fuel industry, although if they want to give me a free gas card, I'll take it. Here is an article that all alarmists should read. It isn't from some right wing fossil fuel funded conspiracy site, just a history of bush fires in Australia and how they start and why. romseyaustralia.com/fireall.html The 2019-2020 bushfire is bad, 16 million acres. It doesn't come close to the 1974-1975 season when 290 million acres, 15% of the entire country was burned. That one was caused by lightning, this one was arson. As far as this heat wave goes, don't you suppose that 1,000 degree fires just might contribute to the temperature readings? During the Black Thursday fires of 1851, the temperatures were 117 degrees F. Well I do hope they get a handle on this one soon.

I am intrigued about where are you getting your information from? Currently there is not a shred of conclusive scientific evidence in support. This is why CO2 theory remains a theory to this day and why the IPCC exists. The spectral analysis studies undertaken by physicists clearly demonstrate that CO2 is not the driver of any documented variation noted since 1979.

Why was not one scientist promoted at the U.N. instead of the indoctrinated child Greta? Because there is no verifiable evidence that fossil fuel CO2 has any effect on climate.

The parties are both in their eighties and Dr. Ball is in poor health. He has had this action hanging over his head like the sword of Damocles for eight years and he will need to wait until January 2021 before the matter proceeds to trial. That is a ten year delay from the original alleged defamatory statement. Other witnesses are also elderly or in poor health. The memories of all parties and witnesses will have faded by the time the matter goes to trial. [16] I find that, because of the delay, it will be difficult, if not impossible, for there to be a fair trial for the defendant. This is a relatively straightforward defamation action and should have been resolved long before now. That it has not been resolved is because the plaintiff has not given it the priority that he should have. In the circumstances, justice requires that the action be dismissed and, accordingly, I do hereby dismiss the action for delay.

American weathermen like to play the climate change card but in Australia they know it is not an easy question to answer: &quot;We find it very difficult in general to attribute climate change impacts to a specific event, particularly while the event is running,&quot; said Dr Richard Thornton, chief executive of the Bushfires &amp; Natural Hazards Co-operative Research Centre.

She needs our help and we‚Äôve ignored her cry for help. For what man, money. Money man. Is it really worth it. Humanity is at the very verge of Extinction <br />And we wanna worry about money. Idk man that just shows our greedy and evil a lot of people are. But maybe there not evil they just can‚Äôt see what there doing man. We need to show them man that what there doing is wrong and that there is a way out. We just need to care and see the whole picture. We need to save earth man and we could do it together as one.

The fire services confirm that only a TINY fraction of fires are started by arsonists and site extreme climate conditions as the number one cause. There has been NO campaign by the greens to stop controlled burning. The greens have NEVER been in power in Australia at state or federal level to stop burning. You have probably been reading Newscorp papers like " The Australian" who deny climate change is happening and support the Australian government which is in the pockets of the Coal lobby.
