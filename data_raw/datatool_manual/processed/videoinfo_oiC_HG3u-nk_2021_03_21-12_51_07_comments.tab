This is how bears die (unless they e been shot). They have no predators so they just suffer with disease until they finally die. This is nature.

No one has examined the bear to determine that anything is in fact wrong with it, they just filmed it until it went away. That being said, if it is sick, that is no reason that it should be exploited, without being helped.

Most atmospheric molecules do NOT reflect light (like oxygen) but CO2 DOES causing what is called the greenhouse gas effect.<br />3) There is natural, balanced system of the carbon exchange system. <br /><br />Humans breathing out CO2 and plants &quot;breathing&quot; it in to make it O2 (Photosynthesis and Repiration) <br />AND carbon on the surface of earth (carbon atoms in animals, plants, etc.) sedimenting onto the ground to later become rock shot out by a volcano or eroded into our atmosphere (sedementation-volcano,weathering). We have set of the imbalance in favor of increase of CO2 in atmosphere.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: There is more CO2 in the atmosphere reflecting light onto earth which heats up the earth resulting in......

The WEATHER has been a bit warmer lately (past couple of decades) and you can rest assured that most of the rest of your life you will be faced with much colder conditions starting in the next few years. The global warming argument is dead. There are only a few zombies still holding that line. I suggest you do some proper research instead of continuing with your wide eyed attitude of swallowing everything coming out of the¬† global warming church. Oh, and invest in a warm coat.

No, this polar bear isn't like this because of global warming, it's probably just old and sick etc. But yes the ice cap is melting more and more every year and global warming is real and is an issue and can be a potential threat for certain species. Who knows, maybe the polar bear might adapt and survive, but who knows, tbh the seal population is suffering more from consequences from global warming, but the seal population is one of the main food sources for polar bears so they might be indirectly severly endangered by the consequences of global warming.

It is quite normal for them to venture down past Hudson&#39;s Bay into Northern Ontario or Quebec, and they live all throughout Northern Canada, a lot of these areas are certainly not the endless ice that polar bears live on, in the Arctic. <br /><br />TL;DR It&#39;s normal for polar bears to be nowhere near ice, it doesn&#39;t mean global warming per se, it means they traveled south.

You think they go to a comfy retirement home and live their last few years under care? Deer in PA die of starvation all the time during the winter months. Not all bears make it folks. Nature is insanely brutal. Thats why bears are most dangerous right before hibernation. Those bears that couldnt get enough to eat will eat anything...including humans. This isnt anything new. This is absolutely a fluff piece. And this is coming from someone who does believe in climate change...but this has nothing to the polar ice caps melting.

The earth goes through phases of being warmer and colder and now we are entering a warmer phase.

But according to most people the factories and cars are why the earth is heating. So your telling me when the ice age happened the factories were warming the atmosphere. Well, the earth had been heating up forever, even before factories and vehicles. Yes we may contribute a tiny bit, but I believe it‚Äôs the course of the earth.

The wild, no matter the planet&#39;s climate, is all about survival and in nature, only the strongest will live, which goes for every creature on Earth. Say what you will about &quot;climate change&quot; but the facts prove that their are far more polar bears in existence today than in the 20th century. They are also marine animals that can swim for over 40 miles, and most of them live on land anyway. Btw camera crew! Why don&#39;t you help the poor bear?! They could have called wildlife services for medical assistance, or at least fed Al Gore to it!	UCESO5NV2bvBPGHddaf5K3bw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCESO5NV2bvBPGHddaf5K3bw	0

The reason it‚Äôs starving may be due to the fact that it isn‚Äôt able to hunt seals, fish, or sea birds because it‚Äôs inland? They never showed what the rest of it‚Äôs surroundings looked like. Also, why is it green? Shouldn‚Äôt this be covered in snow since well, it is winter? It may be simply that it wandered off and couldn‚Äôt find or hunt food easily inland because of its color. I don‚Äôt think this is a direct impact of climate change and more of a correlation not equaling causation situation.

"Of course, that crossed my mind," said Nicklen. "But it's not like I walk around with a tranquilizer gun or 400 pounds of seal meat." And even if he did, said Nicklen, he only would have been prolonging the bear's misery. Plus, feeding wild polar bears is illegal in Canada. The wildlife photographer says he filmed the bear's slow, beleaguered death because he didn't want it to die in vain. "When scientists say bears are going extinct, I want people to realize what it looks like. Bears are going to starve to death," said Nicklen. "This is what a starving bear looks like.""_ I think they could have done something anyway, like to try to get assistance from the government. There's no excuse for not doing nothing.

The point of this video is to open peoples eyes of what impact people are having on this earth, and evidence clearly shows its bad!

Even if only they paid more in taxes - which they aren't - they would need to up the price of their product or service. Which means, we get to spend more.

Everyday citizens like you and I have little power over the petrochemicals put on our crops or the greenhouse gas producing animals lining feedlots worldwide. Carbon taxes are always leveled at large companies rather than average folks, as far as I'm aware.

But, since I'm a nice guy, I'll throw you a bone... They're selling that it's your fault and mine that this bear is living the way he is, that he looks the way he does. That you need to pay them huge amounts of money in taxes in order to stop the climate from changing, which is ridiculous. They're selling you that we all need a global taxing authority, and the main push behind it is climate change. Fearmongering is all it is. Also, I hate things out of context. If this video was trying to prove the opposite point, I'd call them out on their BS. Be skeptical, people.

In other words, I would like to see where you got your info, because I saw an article were a polar bear scientist said we have triple the amount of polar bears than we did in 1970, but global warming started just 5 years later. You keep hearing people using these numbers, yet they won't give an exact source for these numbers. These numbers are undocumented (Are polar bear populations increasing: in fact, booming?, Dr. Steven C. Amstrup, chief scientist with Polar Bears International and USGS polar bear project leader for 30 years). Dr. Steven Amstrup states again, "One Russian extrapolation presented in 1956 suggested a number of 5,000 to 8,000, but that figure was never accepted by scientists." I don't get why nobody fact checks anymore. Please don't hesitate to respond to me, I'm ready ;)	UClp-3niNo4XlbnottUzMDew	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UClp-3niNo4XlbnottUzMDew	1	UgwHL9IH_hGwvOoo1qp4AaABAg	Four Queue

The Slow Mo and the sad music definitely are there too distort perception. But more than that we have so many more polar bears alive today than we used to that it's easier to find that one that is suffering from old age or maybe rabies.

Climate isn&#39;t really a bad thing for the earth because the balance of survival is based of surrounding organisms and environment. This is basically another way of saying the survival of the fittest. Then again this polar could be &quot;dying&quot; of many thing whether it&#39;s disease or age. Polar bears usually die because of starvation because there environment is so scarce of food. They literally eat anything. Vegetation doesn&#39;t cut there needs.

The people who were filming this were filming for several days I believe. They saw the bear try and eat a tire and were trying to explain to people that they couldn&#39;t help it if they wanted to, due to the polar bears diet and how much they actually need to survive. This is due they said to the melting of the ice caps, there is not just one starving bear. Very very heartbreaking ..

So one starving polar bear means that climate change is going to destroy the whole population? Mmm well considering that the polar bear population has INCREASED from around 22000 to around 27000 since the 1980s maybe more information is needed to determine whether climate change has a negative effect on polar bears than a sad video.<br />Side note: warmer weather= longer time frame to gather food and polar bears can swim quite far so ice melting isn&#39;t as bad as you think.

Your implication that it is is a complete straw man. As it happens, polar bears' main food source is seals which they catch in their ice caves. So no, more warm weather does not mean more time for hunting, it means less opportunity for hunting. Polar bear global population is extremely difficult to estimate, and I've certainly never heard anyone claim their population is going up, except people doing what you're doing, pulling numbers out of nowhere, thinking regurgitating some rumour makes them a scientist.

Antarctica warmed about 11 degrees Celsius, nearly 20 degrees Fahrenheit, between about 20,000 and 10,000 years ago, while the average¬†temperature¬†worldwide rose only about 4 degrees Celsius, or 7 degrees. Polar bears have been around for at least 150k years so clearly they have the ability to adapt. What alot of people don't understand is that this has happened across earths history and has been far more drastic then what is going on right now. I encourage you to do your own research and stay away from the information you hear and read on social media and thr main stream media. Sorry for the long response.

All I am saying is that if/when the ice melts the seals will more than likely continue to migrate to the Arctic and simply rest and reproduce on dry land. Besides we are getting off topic of my main point which was a video of a starving polar bear dos not mean that climate change caused that specific bear to starve. The mainstream media does this regularly and it is very disingenuous.	UCvT0vDAIs7Q-Iv1aVauMsqA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvT0vDAIs7Q-Iv1aVauMsqA	1	UgwfAU8bztLF-RiM0Lh4AaABAg	david web

It doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s suffering from climate-related woes. Shooting film of a sickly animal and slapping the term &quot;climate change&quot; in the title is no way to present a case. Show at least a tiny shred of evidence to support what is being stated. Why do you think so many are refusing to buy the whole climate change agenda? They are refusing because of the incredible amount of alarmism, a severe lack of evidence, and more and more evidence that presents a contradictory story.<br />You want people to buy the BS, you need to show evidence.

If companies find out they can profit from doing good for the environment, and most importantly, politicians can get rich from it, then the world will change their opinion. The truth is, no matter how much data and extensive research there is that supports global climate change, people with the power to do something about it won't acknowledge anything that doesn't make them $$. The undeniable fact is, we live on a finite planet with finite resources. It doesn't take a genius to know if you use up resources faster than they can replenish themselves, they're going to run out. Humans rely on the environment just as much if not more as all the other species out there. We're not just hurting "poor polar bears." We're hurting our future generations. Anyways, it's not like I can expect to change your opinion. My advice to you is to check your sources, and your sources' sources. It's easy to find data that supports your opinion, but that doesn't mean it's reliable, or that it makes a good argument to begin with.

So he will just keep interpreting and believing in sources that go the same way. Another example, he said the bear is diseased as if he could not be because of low immunity because of being starving for a while since his habitat has been decreasing, and it means less food. Of course it cannot be a possibility for him because it goes against his belief. Because it can be understood as an effect of global warming which he wants to deny. And it is ironic as well how he only consider there is interest behind for more taxation, while he does not consider that there are a lot of interest of big companies on the anti-global warming speech, which is much more perceptible. It is more sad that he is not alone, he got many likes from such superficial and biased arguments enough to be a top comment.

In this day and age, individual people have elevated themselves to a status that their opinion means something simply because they want to believe something. They don't care about actually learning the science etc. because it's likely too hard; however, they feel entitled to an opinion and feel that individuals must prove themselves every time due to their inability to read all the established science/publications. I remember in one of my environmental health classes, we were told that we would automatically get an A on our final if we could 1 peer-reviewed paper refuting climate change. It goes without saying that we all had to take the final.	UCND8W8M4YLgFdB4EvnLFKDg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCND8W8M4YLgFdB4EvnLFKDg	1	Ugxc4P3zwaBBd1FMrnp4AaABAg	Dani was invented

"Since the 1970s, the Arctic has lost an average of 20,800 square miles of sea ice per year, while the Antarctic has gained an annual average of 7,300 square miles..." that is one fact of truth to that. However, a number of other contributors, such as the increase in moisture due to warming global temps resulting in increased precipitation in Antartica. The erosion of land ice into the sea causing an expansion of the wall like old sea ice in the outer ring of the antarctic sea ice. Furthermore, this is documenting the shrinking of the arctic sea ice, not the antarctic. That by itself, although it is coupled to the rapid melting of glaciers, etc, ¬†is more than sufficient to cause significant damage to the convection currents that create our climate.

Their populations have more or less remained stable, but that isn't the real argument of this video. This video is simply trying to help people see some immediate effects of climate change, namely the loss of sea ice and the inability of these animals to get their normal source of food. If you did some reading, you would find that the food situation is a rather big one with polar bears and has forced them to change their diet from seals to other animals and plants. They are after all bears and like coyotes, raccoons, and American bears (brown and black) are extremely adaptable. Lastly, given the condition of the bear the foaming at the mouth is likely a symptom of overexertion and general stress response. You will see it in starving and overheating dogs...I say all of this to help redirect your focus. Climate change is a real problem, the sea ice is melting. Animals are dying from it in the short term, but that is not the primary fear of climate change. This video is simply to demonstrate the effects of melting sea ice and to show that the sea ice is in fact melting. Sorry for the lecture.

Dani, it's still unclear for the scientists to know whether the polar bear population has increased or if it's because they're more visible now. For MOST areas, the populations are now stable, not increasing. Ice bear hunting has also been banned in some countries that do have a significant influence, also due to improved conservation. When scientists say they are 'threatened', it is not of a food scarcity issue (because they're not restricted to a specific arctic diet fyi), but it's the ECOLOGICAL changes to their habitat itself, the melting ice, that affect them and the rest of the ecosystems in northern arctic areas. So to correlate your anti-climate change views with the increase of the bear population is STILL pure idiocy and scientific ignorance. Do not sell what little critical thinking you have left to the big oil of corrupt america. Nice try, though.

But why has the weather seemingly so off? Lack of rain. Very hot summers. Etc. Back about 50 or so years ago gasoline had lead. In which put alot of lead in the atmosphere which people were inhaling. It goes to show that since lead was removed from the gasoline the amount of lead in a persons blood dropped. That is a example of how humans can affect the environment.

Notice that before it grabs the foam from the trash it has no foam around it&#39;s mouth. And as to why it&#39;s alone, polar bears are not group animals. As some have pointed out, it is Augest when the taken. While it is true that the bear should be mated at the time, not all bears mate. And, even if it was mated, it makes sense for them to have split up to hunt. Or for one to stay behind while the other hunted. And my final point, global warming is real. It is not a left vs right situation. The only reason why it is political, is because predominately one party favors science over profit.

IT&#39;S ALMOST AS IF CLIMATE CHANGE IS ONLY HAPPENING IN THE PAST 30 YEARS, AND NEVER HAPPENED IN THE LAST 4.5 BILLION YEARS OF EARTH&#39;S LIFE.<br />Laughing at the idiots in the comments &quot;this breaks my heart, im crying, I want to feed it&quot; Are you that stupid? Did you cry when a monster asteroid came crashing and wiped entire species? Did you cry when ice ages thousands of years ago killed millions of animals? Earth has been having climate change out of our control for billions of years. It&#39;s the CO2 thermostat, sure, is man-made greenhouse emissions affecting this?

Let us now, by the wise use of periodicals and books, preach the word with determined energy, that the world may understand the message that Christ gave to John on the Isle of Patmos. Let every human intelligence who professes the name of Christ testify, The end of all things is at hand; prepare to meet thy God.‚ÄîThe Review and Herald, July 30, 1908.

The world is to receive the light of truth through an evangelizing ministry of the word in our books and periodicals. Our publications are to show that the end of all things is at hand. I am bidden to say to our publishing houses, Lift up the standard; lift it up higher. Proclaim the third angel&#39;s message, that it may be heard by all the world.

Young bears (2 years or so) being pushed away from their mother is at even higher risk since they are not so experienced and is still learning to hunt. At this time they are the most dangerous and if you get attacked by a polar bear it is much likely a younger bear. How horrible this is to watch, this is not uncommon and the way most polar bears die. The are on top of the food chain and no one that can kill them, except other bears or humans. So when a bear die it is usually from starvation due to old age or factors as described above. I would have called the police or who ever give permission to end it&#39;s suffering. This time it was documented but most of this is never caught on film.	UCEgSUIEUsS7CJNivpn53TSg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEgSUIEUsS7CJNivpn53TSg	0

The east Baffin coast is ice free in summer. It&#39;s far more likely that it is starving due to health issue	UCgpoTN3P3OQ_ac5OrA4XwNQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgpoTN3P3OQ_ac5OrA4XwNQ	0

It&#39;s just the way nature works. This is just a sick animal near it&#39;s inevitable demise. Without any specific information on the condition of the sick bear the video could be evidence of just the opposite condition of what they are trying to imply with the video title.<br />Without any relating evidence the title could just as well read<br /><br /> &quot;Sick polar bear video exposes impact of polar bear population explosion. Due to favorable breading conditions the polar bear population has grown to an unsustainable number.&quot;<br /><br />In fact this video brings back tough memories of my much loved and well cared for best friend of 10+ years. My pup looked very similar to this polar bear after battling a cancer that eventually took him.	UCA579oHvRpgJcQHA8ek4ghw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCA579oHvRpgJcQHA8ek4ghw	0

Try considering what are some small things we can do in our daily lives to make a positive change. For the pessimistic people who think that it&#39;s too late and any small change is futile, you are what is wrong with this generation. Make a difference big or small. Open your mind beyond all the pop star media or politics or entertainment media that is not doing anything to make your life better. Incorporate more plant-based meals, recycle, reduce waste, carpool, basic things like that add up to a big difference. You may not think you can contribute much to life but you are valuable because you have a mind that can lead you do do big things. We can&#39;t live for ourselves anymore. Everything we do affects someone or something else.	UC6WUv693HsuXHRwQn7QRlzg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6WUv693HsuXHRwQn7QRlzg	0

SUMMER. The poster stated as much in the description. Ice melts down during the summer, last I checked. A polar bear finding itself too far south in summer may be sick or stupid. I‚Äôm not an expert in their habits but there is some common sense that must come to play here. Heart breaking, absolutely. Implying ‚Äúfacts‚Äù about climate change? Hardly.

I&#39;m all for reducing pollution but to show a starving bear and simply claim it&#39;s climate change is lazy. What if the bear got injured and that has prevented it from being able to hunt? Sloppy. <br /><br />Edit: the crew that filmed the bear seems to have just stumbled upon the bear and jumped to the conclusion he&#39;s being killed by climate change.

As far as the video goes. That&#39;s an old bear. The younger Bears tend to get the food before the older bears. Therefore, the older bears starve when food is scarce.

Maybe it could‚Äôve been because of an injury or disease,‚Äù Mittermeier said.<br /><br />Research done by polar bear specialsts that work in the field shows that the most common natural cause of death for polar bears is starvation, resulting from one cause or another (too young, too old, injured, sick) (Amstrup 2003):<br /><br />‚ÄúStarvation of independent young as well as very old animals must account for much of the natural mortality among polar bears‚Ä¶ Also, age structure data show that subadults aged 2-5years survive at lower rates than adults (Amstrup 1995), probably because they are still learning hunting and survival skills.‚Äù<br /><br />‚ÄúI once observed a 3-year-old subadult that weighed only 70 kg in November. This was near the end of the autumn period in which Beaufort Sea bears reach their peak weights (Durner and Amstrup 1996), and his cohorts at that time weighed in excess of 200 kg. This young animal apparently had not learned the skills needed to survive and was starving to death.‚Äù	UCqxe6-xx86o48gVB2vs5MzQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqxe6-xx86o48gVB2vs5MzQ	0

Yet there&#39;s no evidence as such and the bears health conditions aren&#39;t even being considered. Do you think that all animals are healthy until death? That things like cancer, or other diseases don&#39;t affect animals also? More so since this was taken in an area with a large bear population and almost all of the others, stated at 95%, are rated healthy. So take your dumb ideas, fake science, and political BS elsewhere.

And like that&#39;s not bad enough in the Atlantic ocean there is an area where plastic trash has gathered and it&#39;s as big as the state of Texas ,we have destroyed our beautiful planet !

Your argument is rooted in an appeal to authority fallacy. You should have just come right out and admitted it, you're quoting Bill Nye. The Nobel Prize winner for his ground breaking work in climate science and all things sciency.

The economic issue being that developing nations cannot afford "green" technology and are heavily reliant on fossil fuels to survive. Of course, when I say they need it to survive, I'm not saying, "If they can't burn fossil fuels, they won't be able to charge their iPhones." No, I'm saying, they won't be able to eat, or drink clean water. Second, the science. Something people like you never think about and should because it validates both your bad arguments and my argument can be found in Step 5. "Global Greening" as it is called is a process by which increased green house gases actually benefits plant life and allows it to grow successfully in more places than it otherwise would have. I don't know if you know this or not, but farmers who use greenhouses to grow some of their crops during colder months add something like 50-60% more CO2 in order to help the plants grow better... Also, humans are a "tropical" species, meaning we tend to live easier lives in tropical climates. Climate change, which is real, (the man made, catastrophic, and fixable without bankrupting the entire world parts are what I struggle with) but it is also opening up huge portions of the world to potential human habitation, like the top half of Canada for instance, or the bottom 1/4 of the Sahara. As a person who puts human flourishing above all else, (which includes having a livable planet!!!) climate change might not be the worst thing that could happen to us... Scenario B has flaws in logic too, I just think this has gone on long enough...

They are currently categorized as &quot;vulnerable&quot;. I am no expert on animals, but it look to me that the bear in this footage is likely suffering from an unrelated (to climate change) disease, or may have been incapacitated by injury for some time. As this is just one bear, without more info, there are just too many possibilities. Now as the next few years creep up, it could be a totally different story.

For all of you rich or poor. Knowing or not kiss your kids tonight go to work in the mourning. Because you or your children or your children children will suffer this same fate. Oil will run low. Seafood will no longer exist in the next 30 years. Human population continues to grow more and more. Food companies can not meet demand. You will look to the God&#39;s up above that you never knew or never care for until it&#39;s all to late. Don&#39;t be to upset this will be all of us one day. God save us all.

Dropping out of the Paris Climate Accord which purpose is to help the environment against global warming so that we don't die as a species. 2. Gives a million acres of federal protected land "back to the people" to be sold to the highest bidder and open the way for mining which will destory that ecosystem. 3. Cuts funding to national parks and then gives his "check" to donate to the national parks which is barely 5% of what he cut. The list goes on.

Obviously it has, but the rate of change of earths temperature is far greater than normal. If you can understand basic statistical data, you can understand that point. And videos like this are greatly misinterpreted. Obviously you&#39;ll never know why the polar bear died, just like you cant make the judgments about any one hurricane, flood, heat wave etc. But statistically they are all increasing, along with species extinction way faster than previously. I know &quot;statistically&quot; is way overused, but seriously challenge yourself to understand data, and make your decision, not solely off how things used to be or one example.

Pls then explain why are humans much fatter than ever? more like global hoax. Since the dawn of time animals have always been starving. More than likely 100% the bear was sick and couldn&#39;t find food thus, being skin. Or maybe he doesn&#39;t want to be like the other fat ugly bears.

The only photos that come up are either obscure right wing political blogs referencing the images of this video, or other photos of generic polar bears, or one picture of a starving polar bear. There is also a study that comes up talking about how ONE CASE of rabies in a polar bear caused posterior paralysis. So maybe explain what you wanted us to find with your search terms, because they clearly didn't lead me to the conclusion that this bear isn't starving vs rabies.

A lot of people here don't seem to understand the situation. *The goal of this short film was not to prove climate change and it was not say that every polar bear are in this situation right now too.* This short film tells the story of the future (in few decades) for every individual polar bear if we continue to act like we are. Right now the populations are stable on the whole since 1 or 2 years. It doesn‚Äôt change the fact that they are a lot less than a decade ago. But the climate is warming and so the ice is melting, particularly there in the North Pole. Because of that in the next decades the habitat of the polar bear wills disappears. *And as their habitat will disappear every polar bear will starve to death like the one this film!* It will be a slow, horrible and unstoppable death/extinction. *We cannot feed them.* Feeding will only make it worse and cause aggression near villages. So there is only one way to save them and it‚Äôs by stopping the climate change. And for the ones that though it was an old bear, it is not. *This bear is young, or I should say was because it's dead now.*	UCJgEpD6ZhiTfhY86_ElfJiQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJgEpD6ZhiTfhY86_ElfJiQ	1	UgwQWAtyIeBmC9738lF4AaABAg	MrYorkieLover Fitness Entertainment

The saddest part is the ignorance and misinformation people spread and tell themselves to feel better about their indifference, selfishness, and lack of empathy for others. Global warming, habitat destruction, pollution, human overpopulation, etc are all interconnected. We can&#39;t reverse what&#39;s been done but we can at least acknowledge the scientific facts and learn from them. This video does not need to spell out the correlation with global warming. Anyone who has seen present day images of the artic can very clearly visualize the prolific impact it has on our ecosystems. Sad.

UgxEbukggqLm8Fsl2Kt4AaABAg	0	0	2017-12-11 06:31:29	Von Mueller	This is one side of the story. Let&#39;s see a video of a kid in China who has a belly with some food in it because his parents went and worked at a factory all day. A factory that contributes to the 25.93% percent of the world&#39;s greenhouse gasses produced in China. Polar bears and other cute animals are simply that, cute animals. They, much like us, will go extinct someday. In fact, I&#39;m pretty sure that polar bears probably have a negligible effect on the world. However, we humans have a huge role in the outcome. I don&#39;t think we should slow our progression but instead guide it to find ways to fix the problem. Just because we add some greenhouse gases to the air today, doesn&#39;t mean that we won&#39;t be able to undo it some other time.<br />Going back to the kids in a third world country. It is easy for us to say that we all need to stop polluting the world, but that is how countries grow. We did it during the industrial revolution, now these countries are trying to catch up. Who are we to complain! You tell me if you had to choose between some far off animal or your child starving to death, what would you do. I know that I would be willing to kill that bear personally to protect my future family.	UCZHmluWKEh5DpkAUH6TEtlg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZHmluWKEh5DpkAUH6TEtlg	0

Please read the video description. Let me explain if that wasn&#39;t clear enough. Due to global warming seals and fishes (primary food of polar bears) have mostly swam somewhere else when the ice and water melted away on that land. The bears unable to swim long distances like amphibians, are stuck on the island and so they starve to death. And there&#39;s one or two because it&#39;s most likely that the other bears died from killing and eating each other.

You see one and all of a sudden it must prove the worst possible reason as to why this bear is like this? You&#39;re It could be climate change sure, or just a bear with a disease or it has been out competed by other healthy bears, which in that case since there aren&#39;t any other carcasses around I&#39;m gonna assume the natural selection is the more likely cause for this bear.

The bears eat the seals and the seals are on beaches when theres no ice. And sea ice was never year round before. Bears have successfully hunted seal on land before and have also failed at hunting seals on the ocean in sea ice. There might be other factors at play here.

It'd be dumb to make an assumption that climate change is in fact affecting an entire ecosystem, and that there are probably hundreds or thousands more polar bears in the same condition or worse. Kinda like how they say we pollute the ocean but ive only seen maybe 4 sea turtles with trash in their stomachs and maybe one whale caught in a ghost net. Those are the only cases of those events, and absolutely do not provide evidence that these assumptions are happening on a much larger scale.

Not bogus stories. It was said on news TV shows. Massively in schools and in numerous text books and science magazines.. Same as today.. Yet..... Non of it happened.. In fact.. It's about the same as it was 30 years ago.. Which was about the same as it was 30 years before that.. I fact it was a bit hotter them.. Never forget.. NOAA decided randomly to complete ignore a long time source of data.. Why? Because it didn't agree with their theories.. But did adjust the baseline created with that data... That's not science..

A lot of people here don't seem to understand the situation. *The goal of this short film was not to prove climate change and it was not say that every polar bear are in this situation right now too.* This short film tells the story of the future (in few decades) for every individual polar bear if we continue to act like we are. Right now the populations are stable on the whole since 1 or 2 years. It doesn‚Äôt change the fact that they are a lot less than a decade ago. But the climate is warming and so the ice is melting, particularly there in the North Pole. Because of that in the next decades the habitat of the polar bear wills disappears. *And as their habitat will disappear every polar bear will starve to death like the one this film!* It will be a slow, horrible and unstoppable death/extinction. *We cannot feed them.* Feeding will only make it worse and cause aggression near villages. So there is only one way to save them and it‚Äôs by stopping the climate change. And for the ones that though it was an old bear, it is not. *This bear is young, or I should say was because it's dead now.*	UCJgEpD6ZhiTfhY86_ElfJiQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJgEpD6ZhiTfhY86_ElfJiQ	1	UgzBTjK02wVEdzsWB3d4AaABAg	YoloMcSwagton

This is what you would call half truths.<br /><br />Point is, the main reason is climate change.<br />Any person with half a brain can agree.

The polar bear population is doing great. Antartica HAS begun freezing again. "Global Warming/Climate Change" is caused by the shifting of the poles that happens every so often (Roughly every 100-200 years). This animal is nowhere near any form of water, therefore it was led here through humanities progressive era's trash. The Guardian is aiming to shame people who are conservative in order to achieve their political agenda (Otherwise they would link us a site or video of how to prevent this from happening again). Liberals approve of mass genocide (reminds me of the Nazis). And lastly, SUICIDE IS NOT OKAY!

Two, so what if they had fed it? You can&#39;t make a starving bear full again with pounds of meat all of a sudden. In fact that most definitely would&#39;ve killed the animal anyway. Adding to that I doubt they would have had substantial food for the animal. Another thing, &quot;This wasn&#39;t caused by global warming.&quot; Well it is if you look at it from a difference light. Of course it isn&#39;t JUST global warming. It&#39;s little things that in turn go to global warming. Polar Bears weren&#39;t made for this environment so them starving isn&#39;t the only thing happening to them nor is global warming the only thing doing this to them.

I am ephemeral, a fleeting light in a cosmos mostly unexplored and yet my conciousness is simply a means for the universe to under stand itself. We are in this universe. We are part of this universe. But the most important of these two facts is that the universe is in us. I know that when many look towards the stars they feel miniscule, I however, do not. I feel big. The knowledge that we are so connected to everything in existence is so powerful, and that&#39;s really what you want in life, you want to feel connected. To be part of the action, and that is precisely what we accomplish by being alive. That fact, that we are part of existence itself, is the most beautiful thing imaginable	UCaD8TBVLB4SHDeOf6An649A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaD8TBVLB4SHDeOf6An649A	0

If we are going to manage the world‚Äôs resources for our own uses, the least that is required of us is to be good stewards and respect the ecosystems that sustain our societies. Any neglect to do so is failure on everyone‚Äôs part to turn away or shrug it off. If it‚Äôs not enough that these animals are suffering and dying in ways nature never intended, it‚Äôs also a reflection of what is to come for our own race when reach a tipping point of unsustainable yield on a resource depleted planet. Don‚Äôt play politics, don‚Äôt point fingers, just do your damn part by speaking up and going green in whatever ways you can manage on an individual basis.<br /><br />This is very hard but necessary for people to watch.

Animals starve all the time, it‚Äôs part of nature. But to starve as a result of climate induced environmental destruction is not what nature intended. It suggests the ecosystems are becoming unbalanced and we are going to lose these species entirely, and eventually the species which we directly rely on for our own survival.

Cause what&#39;s worse, leaving it there to starve and suffer, or saving it. Think about, sometimes it&#39;s better this way.

Animals die and starve all the time and we don&#39;t blame climate change for that.. so I&#39;m confused at the mention of it. It honestly makes me question climate change more than it makes me believe it, because someone clearly is trying to make an emotional video, when there doesn&#39;t seem to be a correlation.

If the bear was infected with rabies we'd see other symptoms like an altered mental status and seizures. Also the "1 million children each year die from hunger." Is a red herring, a logical fallacy, and does nothing to refute the point that polar bears are starving because the melting of the ice that helps them hunt.

I get your point, but 2 things: 1) Statistically, another rabid bear was bound to be filmed. It's actually interesting that it may have taken this long. 2) There is no doubt climate change is affecting the bears. What is yet to be answered is how effectively they will adapt. Still, to insinuate that all polar bears are suffering similar to the one in this video, is fundamentally wrong, and counter-productive to mitigating the problem.

We're talking about bears which are less susceptible to the virus, particularly polar bears, of which there has only been one reported case. If you are correct and this bear has rabies, then it would be the second, somehow unreported, but recorded case. That is stupid.

That rabid polar bear from back in 1989 you googled was the first and probably the only one ever observed. It would be pretty interesting if someone with a camera just happened to catch another rabid polar bear on film after almost 30 years, and the footage was used to lie about climate change. Or the simpler answer would be that the bear was emaciated from lack of food, and foaming at the mouth due to stress.

Perhaps it&#39;s a mix of both because the same people commenting to feed animal, also do not understand the real reasons behind such treasuries.

This bear was filmed on Somerset Island near Baffin Island, Nunavut in August when the bear would have only recently been off the sea ice. That is the reason there is no snow on the land. Bears routinely go without sea ice for up to four to five months, and pregnant females will stay on land for up to eight months. If this bear dying was actually a result of climate change we would have seen bear carcasses everywhere. One bear dying from reasons unknown and it's death being blamed on climate change is complete and utter nonsense.

Animals all over the planet, including humans, have to adapt to changing surroundings. Those animals that adapt and change survive, those that don&#39;t? well, you know what happens to them. Polar bear in the Arctic or a dumb human in Houston, it doesn&#39;t matter. Change or suffer the fate. Mother nature has ways to work this thing out and sometimes we can help. But most of the time animals need to learn just like people.. Mankind is very destructive and for the most part horriable caretakers of the planet. For that we will pay. But that too will be mothers natures way of fixing the problem. Less humans, would not be a bad thing.	UCCaWtQSB7jnO8XmM95A9Enw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCaWtQSB7jnO8XmM95A9Enw	0

The few articles in the 1970s that talked speculated about it was based on the stipulation that aerosol rate in the atmosphere would be larger than CO2. So that's more nonsense you're parroting from the Koch brothers. I can't believe this stupid claim gets used. We hear it all the time -- it's a favorite of claim change deniers. And no, this is not a "semi-recent trend." This is 150 years worth of statistically significant increasing beyond historic global averages. We ARE indeed climbing at a rate faster than we ever have -- except for maybe the dinosaurs and the asteroid. But I assume you think the Earth is 6,000 years old because the Bible told you, huh?

The earth has been in a warming period since the last ice age and human activities intensify the warming. The position of the sun relative to the earth has an insignificant impact the planet since it hasn't changed much. The biggest impact on the planet warming is the composition of the atmosphere that's why in the engineering field we design systems to reduce the amount of pollutants entering the atmosphere for major sources of pollution. The catalytic converter on a car is a good example of this.	UCfLmGNhVjDMfV8MrQ1rZMCg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfLmGNhVjDMfV8MrQ1rZMCg	1	UgyqdeD87ZEHng5NOZd4AaABAg	Sam Hooton

However, we greatly speed up the process of it because of our factories and so on. What couldve taken 10+ yrs to change is now changing yearly because of humans. We are a huge part of the problem.

Repeating an old, refuted, stupid claim from the 1910s when there was still some doubt. Good job. No, it isn't the sun or a natural cycle. It's CO2 caused by burning fossil fuels, like 99.8 percent of people who actually study it say. Read up and learn or shut up.

You can&#39;t routinely feed wild animals because then they just dependant on human support and they can&#39;t develop the lifestyle necessary to live alone in the wild. Second, even if you wanted to feed a wild polar bear, you&#39;d need hundreds of pounds of meat. It&#39;s not like throwing a steak there and that&#39;s it. Bears need seals, not a couple of tuna cans.	UCXfoHE4IVnOXB64H7ljih3g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXfoHE4IVnOXB64H7ljih3g	0

That is true but this really breaks my heart. <br /><br />But for some reason, it clicks to my mind that the area the bear lives in is rocky and there is dried grass. Maybe this polar bear was transferred or maybe took a different route?<br /><br />I think, his could be fake. Although, I could be true at the same time. Every time I see something like this, I just break down. <br /><br />Please give love to animals, animals matter just as much as your family. ‚ù§Ô∏è	UCMlZEsHlTWbLu_yLVqzLV8g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMlZEsHlTWbLu_yLVqzLV8g	0

Or do you just see a sad video and get triggered?<br /><br />Interestingly enough, Sea Legacy co-founder Cristina Mittermeier admitted the actual cause of death was ‚Äúirrelevant‚Äù ‚Äî the point of all of this, like past starving polar bear videos, is to sound the alarm on global warming.<br /><br />‚ÄúIt is impossible to tell why he was in this state. Maybe it could‚Äôve been because of an injury or disease,‚Äù Mittermeier told CBC News.<br /><br />‚ÄúThe point is that it was starving,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúas we lose sea ice in the Arctic, polar bears will starve.‚Äù<br /><br />Polar bear experts, however, have cautioned that such photos don‚Äôt constitute evidence of global warming-induced starvation.<br /><br />‚ÄúIn August, this bear would have been only recently off the sea ice: since most bears are at their fattest at this time of year, something unusual had to have affected his ability to hunt or feed on the kills he made when other bears around him did not starve and die,‚Äù Zoologist Susan Crockford wrote on her blog.<br /><br />‚ÄúIt could have been something as simple as being out-competed for food in the spring by older animals,‚Äù Crockford wrote. ‚ÄúBut if sea ice loss due to man-made global warming had been the culprit, this bear would not have been the only one starving: the landscape would have been littered with carcasses.‚Äù*	UCnUN6Q8EvXMpi6WS9kM_8wQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnUN6Q8EvXMpi6WS9kM_8wQ	0

I know you should not interfere with nature, but Humans have already fucked up so much that, giving them food will actually do atleast one good thing!<br />I wish Trump especially not only agree the to Horrors of Global warming, but atleast do something about it. USA and China are major contributors to pollution! DO something while there is a chance. Its not just animals , HUmans are dying like crazy too. WHy do you think cancer rate is increasing ??

But the fact that polar bears normally live on ice, and there's no ice, points to the fact that the bear is either lost, or all the ice where it used to live has melted. Which is pretty compelling proof of climate warming. Dispute the reasons for the warning and go against the 97% consensus of scientists all you want. But you might as well be arguing that smoking is healthy for you, because that's the equivalent in regards to scientific consensus on an issue.

It&#39;s not the lack of ice or lack of cold that has killed this animal. If it was a lack of the climate, you wouldn&#39;t see this bear in North American zoos all over the place in the dead of summer. What you are seeing here is a polar bear that is old or has suffered from some injury at some point. I would like to see the unedited video in regular speed rather than slo mode. The bear at one point seems to have a very serious limp as if it has a damaged back left leg. If this animal sustained an injury, then it won&#39;t be able to chase down prey, or move to where the prey has gone. I&#39;m not going to deny that the environment has changed, but the environment (or lack thereof) did not cause that bear to die. If the food moved, the bear could move with it. Happens all the time during migrations. This video is being used to mislead/manipulate.	UCQ9_pOsndwdoHu2uDXN5Ciw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ9_pOsndwdoHu2uDXN5Ciw	0

If it is caused from environmental reasons , then it stands to reason that all of the polar bears in that area would be in the same condition . Are they ? Anyone can take a photo of a sick animal , and make all sorts of claims as to the reason for it&#39;s illness . According to NASA photos , the Polar ice cap has grown in the past several years !

You people don&#39;t think wild animals get old, or sick? Do you think that they live forever in the wild? Film of one sick or elderly bear is hardly &quot;proof&quot; of anything. The only thing this proves is that &quot;common sense&quot; is anything but common.<br />While I&#39;m looking at this video in the sidebar a video is listed; &quot;Polar Bear vs Walrus - Planet Earth - BBC Earth&quot;. It shows a healthy looking polar bear attacking a half-ton walrus. It must have been the lack of snow on the ground that allowed the walrus to get away from the bear in that video...

If the first couple of groups of people start feeding the bear, it will start thinking that that&#39;s what all humans do. Now, what would happen if somebody without food come across it? The bear would get angry and it would get it&#39;s food. So, in the end, it&#39;s a choice between a dead bear or a group of dead humans and a dead bear.

Somehow its the &quot;large populations&quot; that hurt the environment. People are contantly bombarded with restrictions and rhetoric, &quot;buy green, buy eletric, recycle, state emissions regulation&quot;. But somehow its ok for the military to constantly test nukes (over hundreds of tests since the 50s US alone), large companies freely destroy forests, seas, etc with little to no restrictions at all. Sad truth is, the ones to blame have the power to change but never do, instead others are made to compensate for their destructive practices so they may continue.

But I'm not talking about some major chicken farm operation. They raise 6-18 chickens at a time, gathering the chicken eggs for their family, other families around their farm, and for donations to their local charities. When the chicken is mature enough and has lived a good life, they butcher it. The chicken dies in less than a second. A humane kill. Tell me which is better: an animal sitting there and dying of old age (meaning its organs shut down and it slowly dies) AND all of the meat goes to waste, or an animal that is humanely harvested do that we may honor the animal that sustains our families?

However, as an avid hunter, fisher, and outdoorsman in general, I firmly believe that there are "humane" practices of obtaining meat. Any true outdoorsman who has any kind of ethics will agree. Some animals eat others. Some don't. Some people, well, MOST people, est meat of some kind (poultry, beef, fish, whatever). That's just the way of life. I don't expect everyone to eat meat just because I do, but the fact is that there certainly IS humane meat.

I believe that is what‚Äôs being conveyed here.	UCobyvfHlRftQQbwYkBKsjSQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCobyvfHlRftQQbwYkBKsjSQ	1	UgySHAnQEzqw9rlSglV4AaABAg	Kenneth Lee

Since the ice is melting faster that causes seals to return to the ocean so the bears are unable to properly hunt them on the ice. Seals are the main food source for polar bears so without them they starve or resort to raiding human settlements for trash	UC2K5ovcOR6-mDa9UpdGj9bA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2K5ovcOR6-mDa9UpdGj9bA	1	UgySHAnQEzqw9rlSglV4AaABAg	Kenneth Lee

Electricity in outlets is provided by power plants. Power plants burn coal and oil. We spend the same amount of energy either way.

That stat only says humans are &quot;likely&quot; a significant factor. It doesn&#39;t say if we are 10%, 50%, or 90%. Conservatives know the climate changes, they know we have an impact on it, they don&#39;t know how much and their questions about such things aren&#39;t taken seriously. Additionally conservatives ask what is the result if we do something and the cost and what is the cost if we don&#39;t. Unfortunately since the most famous Climate change figures like Al Gore and other &quot;climate scientist&quot; have been Massively wrong on their predictions they have very little credibility.

I do not believe what the government is selling us of what is causing climate change, I do not believe carbon dioxide is the cause NASA says Al the planets are showing signs of climate change so if this is true ,climate change is universe wide there has to be more than carbon dioxide! NASA says the sun is doing unusual things, there is even a hole in the sun or what appears to be a hole? Plus there is some evidence that the government and some companies who are experienmenting with weather control, what a weapon that would make for the military, if not our many other militaries would like that!

Their are lions in Africa that starve to death and it&#39;s not do to climate change. It&#39;s nature&#39;s way of killing the weak, and no the camera crew should not feed it. This animal should die as nature intends, because if this bear has Cubs those Cubs will not learn how to get food which causes more starving and more death.

Ugzbsgd5Iog0eleue814AaABAg.8a-yB5KRHLl8a0IhafRehs		0	2017-12-11 01:33:41	Zach ary	G Benci I‚Äôm an environmental science major and even if this particular bear starved for an alternate reason, I can promise you the spike in starvation in their species isn‚Äôt coincidental. An ecosystem is fragile. We literally know that their food source is becoming harder to obtain for them, thus why there‚Äôs a spike in starvation. Their environment depends on the season, when waters get warmer the seals and fish they depend on will move to colder waters. We know this also as a fact. Their food source is moving to colder waters. We know this is a fact as well. The average temperature in their environment is getting warmer. This too, is a factual scientific phenomena. So, understand that just because you can‚Äôt answer your own question doesn‚Äôt mean everyone else is as reluctant to find a reasoning for things we can physically prove with data. Don‚Äôt mean to come off disrespectful either, but I‚Äôm also tired of the idea of a harmful change in climate being debunked solely because it‚Äôs hard to understand and not because there‚Äôs any other reasoning to support the scientific data we can collect.

China and other countries must pay for the pollution they have caused 8.( My favorite) you state it takes basic critical thinking skills to see the truth.

If you see an animal eating out of a rusted trash can, what can that tell you about that animal? 3. How many types of global warming are theorized? How are they classified? 4. What is the total number of scientists that have a background in... science (LOL) are there in the world? 5. How many of that number of scientists agree that global warming has been scientifically proven? 6. Where and when were these scientists asked, and what were their names? 7. How in the 21st and 22nd centuries do scientists theorize that the earth will be ruined, and how many scientists agree with the same theory (out of the total population of scientists)? 8. How many companies(politicians) benefit from non-green policy compared to green policy? 9. Which agreement decreased the amount of coal used in the U.S. by 20% while increasing the amount of fracking by 40% by 2020? What percent increase of coal was to be shipped to china in the same amount of time? Who established this agreement? 10. Who directly benefits from carbon credits? What was his party?

To clear things up I went to a conservative, private Catholic school. Not public. And I've read scientific articles on the subject. It takes basic critical thinking to see the truth here. Look at any credible graph, and you will see a direct correlation between the rise in C02 emissions and the rise in temperature. AKA climate change is indeed caused by man. Ask yourself - who benefits from the denial of manmade climate change? Companies that like to mass produce, but can't because of limits on their C02 emissions. Also, who are you willing to believe?

Ryan Gagnet probably hasn't read any opposing viewpoint, doesn't know that our top 20 most pollution ridden cities combined don't equal the #10 of China's, hasn't read a single scientific journal on anything (ever) and is a good boy to parrot his owner's words. Seriously do you even think? Who made it easier to expatriate jobs? Who made it easier to shift corporate holdings overseas? Who makes it more profitable for these things to occur? Who gets the bulk of their campaign donations from Wall Street investors? No, you don't think. You just act like Pavlov's dog and whenever a bell rings you blame the Republicans. Why don't you wake up. By the way dingus. 99% of scientists agree that climate change occurs because only a damned idiot thinks that it doesn't. Republicans aren't saying that the climate doesn't change. They are saying humans don't have as much of a part in it as alarmists say we do. And we REALLY don't. Think that's a stupid position to have? Well so is taking someone at their word who has every incentive to over or under exaggerate the results of their findings. Would you believe the scientists hired by the tobacco companies when they told you that cigarettes were safe? Then why in gods name would you believe scientists hired by the government with the mandate to AND I'M ACTUALLY QUOTING HERE...

Interestingly enough, Sea Legacy co-founder Cristina Mittermeier admitted the actual cause of death was ‚Äúirrelevant‚Äù ‚Äî the point of all of this, like past starving polar bear videos, is to sound the alarm on global warming. ‚ÄúIt is impossible to tell why he was in this state. Maybe it could‚Äôve been because of an injury or disease,‚Äù Mittermeier told CBC News. ‚ÄúThe point is that it was starving,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúas we lose sea ice in the Arctic, polar bears will starve.‚Äù Polar bear experts, however, have cautioned that such photos don‚Äôt constitute evidence of global warming-induced starvation. ‚ÄúIn August, this bear would have been only recently off the sea ice: since most bears are at their fattest at this time of year, something unusual had to have affected his ability to hunt or feed on the kills he made when other bears around him did not starve and die,‚Äù Zoologist Susan Crockford wrote on her blog. ‚ÄúIt could have been something as simple as being out-competed for food in the spring by older animals,‚Äù Crockford wrote. ‚ÄúBut if sea ice loss due to man-made global warming had been the culprit, this bear would not have been the only one starving: the landscape would have been littered with carcasses.‚Äù	UCRWniQ2oVfBAFTgH-pJTnng	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRWniQ2oVfBAFTgH-pJTnng	1	UgwP_THO8AGPyUmY6ul4AaABAg	Ryan Gagnet

We were absolutely, without a doubt heading toward another Ice Age. I can remember reading an article about it in Popular Science magazine back then. Fast-forward thirty years. Oops, the scientists have to make a minor adjustment to the theory; it's really Global *Warming* that will destroy the planet. Not just Global Warming, it's man-made Global Warming. Why, if things don't radically change within a decade (or less) the poles will melt and coastal cities will flood. All it will take is an average world-wide increase of 1degree (give or take) to push things to the point of no return. Think Water World. That was the mantra like ten years ago. Well, are folks in New York City all treading water? Are the ice caps gone? No? So what gives? I thought all these famous "Climate Experts" like Bill Nye the Climate Guy were on top of this? So maybe the hundreds private jets all these concerned Climatologists take to this or that Climate Conference several times a year spew out a special anti-global-climate-changing exhaust? See, if all this were real, do you think Al Gore and the rest would be taking private jets all over the planet to one Conference or Symposium after another? It would be like you claiming to be concerned for the welfare of endangered animals then heating your home by burning pandas in the fireplace. Actions speak louder than words, and the actions of those pushing the agenda don't match their words.

I also don't agree with how the left skews it and pretends they have no hand in industries that help ruin the environment as well over the decades. These agencies are pretty in efficient at what they do for our tax dollars, I don't think they should be outright removed but reformed, of course thats not how our government likes to do things though.

Second of all, science is not democratic. Just because 98 percent of people believe something doesnt make it true. 98 percent of scientists thought the earth was flat and only 1 man thought different. We aren't experiencing a catastrophic climate warming...the fluctuations have been relatively stable for the past 10,000 years, actually, and continue to be so...also....another point...every time the globe warmed it was a time of enormous human growth and flowering. Every time the globe warmed it was a renaissance, such as the 5th century cathredal building explosion, or the actual renaissance. Every time the globe cooled, it opened up the doors to famine and disease, like the 1300s black plague....coincided with a global climate cooling. So global warming isnt necessarily a bad thing.

Animals starve everyday in every part of the country, showing one animal "starving" isnt proving anything, It's been proven that the polar bear population has actually been imcreasing too, the temperatures are still the same as they were 75 years ago. Humans can grow their own food and hunt for it, clearly the area he's in is one of the few areas in the world where temperatures are too cold for most plant or wildlife to survive.

Whether global warming/climate change contributed to the melting of the Arctic or not is a moot debate. The region is melted and polar bears will be starved to extinction without habitats to live in within our lifetimes. I wish I could be around to watch the videos of the great grandkids of these bickering factions starve to death. It would feel like karmic justice.

Yes, the ice melts and it can&#39;t hunt to same creatures, but if the bear is in the right area it&#39;s fine.

And it should definitely not be speculated that this is the reasoning. Nor should it be alright for the video to lie about something and be justified because it spreads awareness!

We do it all of the time for animal and plant conservation. Bears also can evolve and adapt. They just need a new food source. We could relocate them to an artificial habitat or we could start relocating a food source to the area that can replace their current diet. We have already been relocating them since 2015 into the Smoky Mountains. Scientists have also suggested moving them to the arctic.

The lucky animals will find a way to adapt and live on. If you think about it, the polar bears ancestors had to adapt to live in the harsh cold environment to begin with considering the earth was once majority tropical. That being said, I can‚Äôt help but wonder why this polar bear was out in a barren area like that. Usually they follow the water since aquatic animals are a huge part of its diet. It looks more like it is old and sickly than suffering climate change issues. It‚Äôs location seems way to strange.

It isn't the same as saying we may as well eat McDonalds. You can take steps in your own life to make sure you aren't buying products or supporting systems or industries and institutions who support the exploitation of resources or of human rights. We don't need a pact, treaty, taxes or solar panel farms or AI and a increased dependency on technology to solve our problems. Those solutions exacerbate the problem. If you want to do your part then do your part, but my point is that with or without a carbon tax, AI, increasing our dependency on technology, oil, etc. the changes will still happen. No matter what we do there will be fires, tornadoes, hurricanes and other extreme weather occurrences. No matter what we do the ice will melt and the sea level will rise. We can move, we can adapt, we can try to help save lives, but we shouldn't waste time and resources trying to sustain the infrastructure we know is collapsing or the industries and systems or institutions that are corrupt, collapsing and unsustainable. Places like Puerto Rico, should just be abandoned and the people relocated. We don't have to keep developing, keep building new roads and highways and keep exploiting resources, but nobody is willing to sacrifice their luxury or convenience and live simpler more humble lifestyles. They want to maintain the status quo and think they can somehow manipulate nature enough to continue this unsustainable behavior and not create more problems. There's a difference between doing nothing and not doing the same thing we have been doing.

Also, feeding him once will not really solve the problem. Also, the amount of food would need to be significant.

At the time of filming that bear should have been fat and happy, having eaten it's fill BEFORE the sea ice melted for the season. That it did not would seem to indicate something may have prevented that, like competing bears, or an injury or disease. But, naturally, it is easier and more beneficial for this group to claim "Climate Change" as the cause, regardless of whether it's true or not. Now, I am not saying it is not a factor, but to claim it is the sole cause, without actually autopsying this particular bear is just speculation rather than science.

As humans encroached on wolf territory the ones to survive were those who were more docile and more friendly towards humans(the humans would give the friendly ones food scraps). Gradually the genes that made them docile and friendly towards humans got passed on because those who received food were the ones to survive, and thus we have the dog.

A lot of people here don&#39;t seem to understand the situation. <b>The goal of this short film was not to prove climate change and it was not say that every polar bear are in this situation right now too.</b> This short film tells the story of the future (in few decades) for every individual polar bear if we continue to act like we are.<br /><br />Right now the populations are stable on the whole since 1 or 2 years. It doesn‚Äôt change the fact that they are a lot less than a decade ago.<br />But the climate is warming and so the ice is melting, particularly there in the North Pole. Because of that in the next decades the habitat of the polar bear wills disappear. <b>And as their habitat will disappear every polar bear will starve to death like the one this film!</b> It will be a slow, horrible and unstoppable death/extinction.<br /><br /><b>We cannot feed them.</b> Feeding will only make it worse and cause aggression near villages. So there is only one way to save them and it‚Äôs by stopping the climate change.	UCJgEpD6ZhiTfhY86_ElfJiQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJgEpD6ZhiTfhY86_ElfJiQ	0

Thus leading many of the Seals, migrate to another place, and because of that Polar Bears can't find any food in their habitat, eventually starves and dies.

They only captured what was going to happen anyway. Would you rather they not capture this & not shed light to this problem? And if they did feed it? That's one meal. That's not going to miraculously fatten and save the bear. It will only tide him over for a few hours and then what?

The new population estimates from the 2016 Scientific Working Group are somewhere between 22,633 to 32,257 bears, which is a net increase from the 2015 number of 22,000 to 31,000. The current population numbers are a sharp increase from 2005‚Äôs, which stated only 20,000 to 25,000 bears remained ‚Äî those numbers were a major increase from estimates that only 8,000 to 10,000 bears remained in the late 1960s. Scientists are increasingly realizing that polar bears are much more resilient to changing levels of sea ice than environmentalists previously believed, and numerous healthy populations are thriving. ‚ÄìAndrew Follett, The Daily Caller, 16 February 2017	UC0mXLx4fKxjnxpUuuJaGmSA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0mXLx4fKxjnxpUuuJaGmSA	0

Arctic ice reached a record level of increase this year and the ice is increasing not decreasing. Temperatures haven‚Äôt changed in more than 10 years so filming one polar bear starving and claiming its global warming is dishonest to the extreme. This is called anecdotal evidence. Are you saying there are never cases of animals starving in the wild under natural circumstances? Percentages of animals of all species starve. It‚Äôs been a fact of nature long before human were ever around. Filming one case of this on a planet of Billions and billions of animal life and claiming it‚Äôs due to the agenda you‚Äôre trying to push is a scam.

Honestly, how can you ignore the fact that there is such thing as global warming. In fact the only reasons the population grew for a short period of time isbecuase they banned the hunting of polar bears in some countries but it is still true that global warming is affecting polar bears in the Antarctic region because of the amount of glaciers that receding. Polar bears heavily depend on the ice to be stable enough for them to catch prey. But now many polar bears have to go up to 60 miles away from shore, this makes them risk getting tired and possible drowning	UCWqLeQglgXNVzPtesBBdNAg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWqLeQglgXNVzPtesBBdNAg	1	Ugyp0tXQtseRmhEZ4ER4AaABAg	Jim C

You're on the wrong side of history, if the world survives long enough to write history about our times you'll be in it. The people who protested against a cleaner environment. Do you realize how ridiculous that sounds? To be a pawn to a dying coal industry. You're opinion is just a copy of so many bad lessons in history books.

Studies show that sea ice has only increased in Antarctica, and that's because of the effects of climate change (Such as the lack of ozone in the stratosphere which cools that area more) and the melting of land ice. Last I checked, though, polar bears live around the Arctic, where ice loss has been a common problem. No need to use your conspiracy theories yet, my friend.

Under the Kyoto Protocol, the 'caps' or quotas for Greenhouse gases for the developed Annex 1 countries are known as Assigned Amounts and are listed in Annex B. The quantity of the initial assigned amount is denominated in individual units, called Assigned amount units (AAUs), each of which represents an allowance to emit one metric tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent, and these are entered into the country's national registry. In turn, these countries set quotas on the emissions of installations run by local business and other organizations, generically termed 'operators'. Countries manage this through their national registries, which are required to be validated and monitored for compliance by the UNFCCC. Each operator has an allowance of credits, where each unit gives the owner the right to emit one metric tonne of carbon dioxide or other equivalent greenhouse gas. Operators that have not used up their quotas can sell their unused allowances as carbon credits, while businesses that are about to exceed their quotas can buy the extra allowances as credits, privately or on the open market. As demand for energy grows over time, the total emissions must still stay within the cap, but it allows industry some flexibility and predictability in its planning to accommodate this. By permitting allowances to be bought and sold, an operator can seek out the most cost-effective way of reducing its emissions, either by investing in 'cleaner' machinery and practices or by purchasing emissions from another operator who already has excess 'capacity'. Since 2005, the Kyoto mechanism has been adopted for CO2 trading by all the countries within the European Union under its European Trading Scheme (EU ETS) with the European Commission as its validating authority. From 2008, EU participants must link with the other developed countries who ratified Annex I of the protocol, and trade the six most significant anthropogenic greenhouse gases. In the United States, which has not ratified Kyoto, and Australia, whose ratification came into force in March 2008, similar schemes are being considered.

Maybe it could‚Äôve been because of an injury or disease,‚Äù Mittermeier¬†told¬†CBC News.<br /><br />‚ÄúThe point is that it was starving,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúas we lose sea ice in the Arctic, polar bears will starve.‚Äù<br /><br />Polar bear experts, however, have cautioned that such photos don‚Äôt constitute evidence of global warming-induced starvation.<br /><br />‚ÄúIn August, this bear would have been only recently off the sea ice: since most bears are at their fattest at this time of year, something unusual had to have affected his ability to hunt or feed on the kills he made when other bears around him did not starve and die,‚Äù Zoologist Susan Crockford¬†wrote¬†on her blog.<br /><br />‚ÄúIt could have been something as simple as being out-competed for food in the spring by older animals,‚Äù Crockford wrote. ‚ÄúBut if sea ice loss due to man-made global warming had been the culprit, this bear would not have been the only one starving: the landscape would have been littered with carcasses.‚Äù	UCejz7l_z4DNIwcrY5Bvb7Xw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCejz7l_z4DNIwcrY5Bvb7Xw	0

As climate change increases and the sea ice melts, polar bears have to swim longer distances from iceberg to iceberg, which leaves them exhausted for when they need to hunt for food, such as a seal. A seal however, is not going to be affected by the loss of sea ice in any way, so your argument is stupid	UCecssk9gnlNN0ZcxSxyzIdw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCecssk9gnlNN0ZcxSxyzIdw	1	UgwfwMkku7Z8ogKWLlZ4AaABAg	Jinx Winters

Meanwhile, california is on fire in winter and it's snowing in texas. BUT THE BEAR IS JUST A LOSER BEAR, RIGHT??? Oh by the way, the polar bear's habitat is the ice sheets, that"s how they hunt. They are WHITE. no ice, no hunt. There are facts to back up the dangers faced by the polar bear species, but you smartass assholes just enjoy telling each other how smart you are for thinking the opposite of everyone. You are nothing but a bunch of idiots with a snake oil peddler for president. Enjoy your hipster circle jerk.

To dumb that down for you a bit, the climate has always changed. I can remember back in the 80‚Äôs when the scientists were sounding the alarms and saying we were heading for the next ice age at a rapid pace. They predicted global famine by the year 2000 and we would suffer a great food shortage in the US. Now they‚Äôre saying he earth is getting warmer.... he one thing that is a well known fact that everybody can agree on is 1) the climate has always changed 2) over the last 10 years the US has made huge cuts in carbon emissions. Cars are far cleaner burning now than they used to be and they get far better fuel mileage than 10 years ago and industrial pollution is at the lowest levels that it‚Äôs been since the industrial revolution. 3) if man is responsible for climate change then why aren‚Äôt we hearing about a slowing of global warming due to the great reductions in our carbon footprint? Instead, all we hear about is that we are increasing the rate at which the earth is warming. Something doesn‚Äôt quite add up there. Also, what‚Äôs wrong with a few degree increase in temperature? Yeah yeah, hurricanes blah blah. I live on the gulf coast in the Florida panhandle and in my 43 years I have been through a few hurricanes but think of the benefits. Farmers could grow more food, have longer growing seasons, grow citrus farther north, fewer deaths from blizzards and people freezing to death, fewer lost work days to snow, fewer accidents from ice. My point is that if the temp ticks up a degree or two, whether it‚Äôs from pollution or natural, we will all be fine. Humans have been adapting to climate change since the beginning of time.

I mean I understand that animals going extinct is extremely bad, but not bad enough for me to want humans to lower our standards of living. Yeah polar bears used to be thriving way back then, but look at how far humans have come. I mean, we can split the atom and reduce a particle&#39;s temperature to absolute zero! Seeing that humans were living in absolute disease and filth a few hundred years ago, I don&#39;t see how people can be ashamed of how far we&#39;ve come...<br /><br />P.S.

For me, this seems to just support all the warnings I was taught as a child if we didn&#39;t do something about the environment stuff like this may happen and that was 30 years ago. It&#39;s odd how hard it is to change someone&#39;s mind about something, yet these crazy conspiracies seem to be able to do that to anyone. Although mainly religious. Most of my friends who aren&#39;t don&#39;t believe in any of those consipracies, but the religious people I know think the thousand year thing and the world is actually flat and etc.. I even had to explain a lens flair to my friend&#39;s mom because she was certain she caught the planet nibiru on her camera taking a picture of the eclipse and she thinks it&#39;s that planet that&#39;s controlling all of us. I once brought up that since this planet is responsible for what everyone thinks is true today. since there&#39;s so many religious people they must have lied about that too, even more so than the others if it&#39;s that kind of control they want. She didn&#39;t like that thought. But she wasn&#39;t like this 3 years ago, she wasn&#39;t as religious or full of hate either. I don&#39;t know what changed. I feel like it&#39;s my fault because I hooked up her computer to her TV for her, then a month later stopped by to see her youtube playing and her suggestion list was full of lizard people, secret tunnels all around the world, and any conspiracy you can throw a stick act. I asked her if she ever saw any Vsauce or maybe scishow but she just says science is a lie to control people... :( It&#39;s heart breaking.

God created us in his image, for his glory and to have a loving relationship with Him. God loves us, he gives us free will to follow him, or to not follow him. All of us have sinned against God, we have all like sheep, gone our own way. We have chose something else meaningful to us, in our life to replace God. God is holy, he must punish sin otherwise he's not a holy God. It's no different than a judge, sentencing someone to prison. Even if the person being judged, would bring up all the good deeds he has done. It still doesn't pay for his crimes. So if God were to judge us, we would all be guilty. But God is rich in mercy, he sent his only begotten Son Jesus. To die on the cross for our sins, Jesus took the punishment you and I deserve. All you have to do, to receive salvation is by repenting of your sins. And believe in the gospel, that Jesus died on the cross for you. And God rose Him on the third day, I encourage you to read the gospel of Matthew God bless you!

They die. Every single living thing dies. A few bears will die every single day regardless of who is president. Question: How much do humans add to the natural phenomenon of climate change? Pro tip, nobody knows. Climate change is natural so even if human were not on this earth it would still change and sumbass bears will still die everyday.

UgzdVD-sJGJkvZZwkk54AaABAg.8a-TwRbvxOs8a06MDsCOhN		1	2017-12-10 23:45:46	Master Chief	My thoughts on this is that animals should be retained. They should be kept in Zoo or sold at a good price, To be killed or not is an option of owners choice I know it doesn‚Äôt sound right but it‚Äôs the only way possible. Animals that were killed by human to extinction were not owned by people it‚Äôs what killed them off since people secretly killed animals that are under protection, meaning just because the government say that it‚Äôs illegal to do, doesn‚Äôt necessarily means everyone will take orders from that even though we should. Imagine if we own animals that were going extinct more of them will be alive because the population would be controlled meaning that the owners who sold them wouldn‚Äôt use all of them completely because if he killed them all then he won‚Äôt have anything to sell or make money out of, a smart man would breed more and sell more to make more money, also it‚Äôs more easy to know an exact number instead of an estimated. We will be able to know exactly how many animals we have if they live in a farm or controlled areas. Less trophy hunting on animals due to owners potentially shooting trespassing hunters.

Besides we don‚Äôt know the situation... the person who made this could‚Äôve been easily titled this to get view it was probably caused by something else. No sources or anything honestly you guys feel sorrow for just about anything I bet if I showed you a skinny guy who was starving you be sad and I get millions of views, but in reality he‚Äôs a mass killer. Don‚Äôt be blaming climate change or anything because you obviously don‚Äôt know the situation. I was once told that to know something you have to see it yourself or else people will guide your world for you and son you‚Äôre going to die slow.

Just think of the 80 years of resources that person will use at the expense of Mother Earth.<br /><br />If you are angry about these impossible choices they will be forced upon us. The evidence is unmistakable, denial is not an option. <br /><br />Or, -- be irresponsible -- eat, drink and be merry because it&#39;s already too late.

This is not ths first polar bear to die of starvation (who knows, he may even be sick) and it wont be the last. There are videos of emaciated lions and other animals and also humans. Should all those also be tied to &quot;manmade&quot; climate change? Its about time more of us start using our brains rather than pandering to someone else&#39;s agenda.

We would all die of asphyxiation because the ocean is not our natural habitat and we would not be able to breathe. Just like how these polar bears are dying from hunger at young ages because they are not living in THEIR natural habitat thus not being able to find food to sustain themselves. Back when the Bible was written we did not have such machines and technology that we do today. Please don&#39;t base your argument off of something that has no correlation with the Modern Era.

This carbon dioxide rises into the atmosphere, spreads out and begins to trap in heat which would otherwise radiate out into space. Together with other gasses, this creates a greenhouse effect. More heat is trapped, and this causes ice to melt. When ice melts, polar bears have less safe habitat in which to hunt. None of this is difficult to understand. I've understood it¬†clearly since I was eleven.	UCSfEXwQFYW8QAGg4LXG47hA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSfEXwQFYW8QAGg4LXG47hA	1	UgyXxeuRdSLa5PD9Zm94AaABAg	Glen Smitter

You see we humans do enjoy mass breeding cows for our consumption. Cows produce methane and I'll have you know that methane(as a greenhouse gas) is 30 times stronger than co2, not to mention that we need to breed more livestock to supply the demand of a growing population of people. In fact livestock produce more greenhouse gases than vehicles do. "Who is to blame for that?" You may ask yourself... An idiot would answer the cow, but anyone with a substantial amount of braincells would answer humans, for breeding the cows in the first place, but the majority of people won't stop eating meat, so we have to regulate co2. Since it is all we can do for now... Or at least what is most plausible at the moment. We are a major part of the process, the earth doesn't (naturally) change in the span of decades, at least not this quickly. Centuries is closer to how fast it changes, and even that is too fast.

If not, oh well.<br /><br />I don&#39;t really cry over species going extinct or endangered. It&#39;s sad, for sure, but it&#39;s not my job to feed them and teach them to adapt to the state of the world. Adapt or die, that&#39;s nature, going extinct is natural.<br /><br />The only tragic thing I see is that the bear must have seen living humans in the distance and even starving didn&#39;t have the sense to recognize them as fresh food and give it&#39;s dying breaths trying to eat and live on.

An invasive species, a plague, you either find a way to compete or die out. That's nature. Humans aren't the only ones out competing other species... Pharoah ants off the top of my head. And I didn't say I could care less, it is sad, but it's nothing new or strange. This is being treated as shocking news or a wake up call. Humans are starving too, and so are countless other species.

Now try telling that to his Mother and the rest of his family!! There really is no argument here!! Everything on this planet needs each other to coexist whether you call it adapting or coexisting we need each other to live!! So in other words yes we learn to adapt but it's a way we learn how to coexist don't you think! Maybe we as humans should be the ones that go extinct and give the animals back their planet so they can coexist together because apparently humans cannot!!

Plenty are important but nature isn't some entity where if a deer dies it's part of some balance. It died because something was hungry or it died of natural causes. Either way its body became a resource for bacteria and insects or got picked clean. It's note a force, it's many creatures doing what they gotta do to survive. A predator just eats when hungry. Nothing more, nothing less, it doesn't ask if it's eating too much.	UCkxL0gGDvaekRRqR2YzLX3A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkxL0gGDvaekRRqR2YzLX3A	1	Ugy0nKozqYGp4f4MRDF4AaABAg	Miriromi13

To the people saying that humans should feed the polar bear... that won‚Äôt solve anything other than prolonging it‚Äôs life a couple more days for it‚Äôs eventually inevitable death. Feeding wild animals is out of our control. However, the fact that we would make the choice between putting some nasty concrete building vs letting wildlife actually HAVE a life there is what pisses me off. We are the downfall of our own planet. So when we get killed off because of nuclear war or some biological or chemical apocalypse... it‚Äôll be our own damn fault. We are the nastiest creatures on Earth. Not physically, but psychologically. We‚Äôd rather kill ourselves off for scientific development rather than live and let NATURE LIVE. Damn...

Even tho he did pull-out of the recent Climate Change Conference in France. And denies Climate Change is man made. Further more the delegations he does send are for the proliferation of fossil fuels like "clean coal". AND.....just to educate you about Trumps tax bill that is currently being tossed around in the House and in the Senate. If you are a person whom earns less than $100K per year. Well than Trumps purposed tax bill will have you pay more in taxes than you do now. I hope you earn more than $100K a year. The way you run to his defense.

Why do most people hate the topic of climate change? Because the common people are constantly bombareded with the rhetoric of climate change when the ones who really need to hear the message are the giant industries destroying the earth. The guilty try to rub their guilt on the innocent so when destruction weighs down on them somehow its every ones fault.

Also, both China and India are significantly less developed, have a larger population, and more manufacturing plants than the us. Their environment will obviously be a lot worse than our. Ours was horrible until the government and EPA started to hold businesses accountable but we're going back now.

We don&#39;t know how many there are, how many there are supposed to be, or whether or not they are fluctuating in numbers. Until we have actual data we cannot make an assessment as to whether or not their lives have improved or have gotten worse.<br />I do like the idea of selling cattle to green peace, or whomever is interested in taking care of these bears. They can then send the cows up into the Arctic region for the Bears. That would be far less expensive than paying someone to make charts and graphs.

They then invade areas where humans live to feed. Which means dead animals pile up in close proximity to humans. Then decaying bodies fester with bacteria and disease. Sooner or later a human gets infected the disease mutates, and guess who now in danger of extinction?	UCKhLElZbSIydkVL73GWbNAQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKhLElZbSIydkVL73GWbNAQ	0

They&#39;re too slow and cannot catch the fast moving seal. Hence they invariably starve to death. It should be noted that during the medieval warming period that lasted about 500 years much more of the Arctic was ice free than today....and the bear survived. However there is a problem., and that&#39;s human encroachment on wild habitats in the polar region due to oil and gas exploration.

To make this video and maybe sway some votes towards climate control, when that&#39;s what they are doing already. Good try. We will be seeing the same thing with penguins too. Cause what they are saying is that atmospheric nuclear detonations are in no way, or couldn&#39;t be in any way, responsible? Well the earth has been around for a long long time without us and it will continue to be I would imagine. But realistically, how can they say they have no part in it and how can they say doing more things to change the weather is a good thing when, in my opinion, that is what this is from...?

You also just contradicted your belief in dangerous global warming, but seem too ignorant to notice. If polar bears need ice and freezing water to thrive, why are their numbers out of control? Does that mean there is plenty of ice and AGW is a hoax, or does it mean polar bears don't require such a nasty cold environment to thrive? It's actually both.

The only difference is that we are rapidly worsening the effects like sea level rise and have sped up the process by at least a few 100 years. I agree with your statement that it was here before us, but wanted to make sure you were clear on the fact that we have turned it into an irreversible disaster. First the polar bears, then maybe us. Humans first showed up when the temperatures started to equalize and they have been in the same range since, we are changing the temperatures that sustain us and our food supplies, so.

(No diseases, health problems, disabilities, etc.) So now that we know that it's the starvation that killed him, there are only a limited amount of options as to how he became so thin. The MOST LIKELY (not saying definitively) option is that it's from a result of climate change, due to the drastic decrease of ice sheets the polar bear most likely ran out of any significant area to hunt for prey (such as seals) that are very important to their diet to maintain their health. Thus, casuign the bear to starve. Now, that might not be the complete reason as to why the bear is starving, it's just the most likely scenario.

(No diseases, health problems, disabilities, etc.) So now that we know that it's the starvation that killed him, there are only a limited amount of options as to how he became so thin. The MOST LIKELY (not saying definitively) option is that it's from a result of climate change, due to the drastic decrease of ice sheets the polar bear most likely ran out of any significant area to hunt for prey (such as seals) that are very important to their diet to maintain their health. Thus, casuign the bear to starve. Now, that might not be the complete reason as to why the bear is starving, it's just the most likely scenario.

(No diseases, health problems, disabilities, etc.) So now that we know that it's the starvation that killed him, there are only a limited amount of options as to how he became so thin. The MOST LIKELY (not saying definitively) option is that it's from a result of climate change, due to the drastic decrease of ice sheets the polar bear most likely ran out of any significant area to hunt for prey (such as seals) that are very important to their diet to maintain their health. Thus, casuign the bear to starve. Now, that might not be the complete reason as to why the bear is starving, it's just the most likely scenario.

I chose to be kind because even if it just a tiny contribution it still is a contribution to change this world to a better one. I understand the illegality of the situation just don't agree.

Not unless you have a plan to reintroduce them unto suitable habitat. And this is the rub; the polar bear's habitat is declining. Polar bears rely on ice, ice that seals use to make breathing holes. Its makes the bear's hunting easier and unlike most animals, summer is a lean time for polar bears. The other problem is that who'll fund looking after your genetically viable population of polar bears in perpetuity?

That this bear somehow didn't get the memo to migrate further north before the summer season melted everthing? If not those, then that maybe that the bear was already sickly, old and dying and so didn't make it a point to migrate this time? Or that maybe this footage was purposly posted on the internet over 6 months after filming it for dramatic effect when the northern hemisphere was experiencing its wintertime (North America, Europe, Russia)? So to maybe tug at the heartstrings of both normal people and global warming bleeding hearts alike so the population would believe this happened af few days ago as opposed to half a year ? Did anybody bother to notice how green the atric tundra was for this time of year? Or maybe that the white artic cotton grass and poppy blooms that only grow in the spring and summer months are somehow growing it what's supposedly the dead of winter for that location?

(No diseases, health problems, disabilities, etc.) So now that we know that it's the starvation that killed him, there are only a limited amount of options as to how he became so thin. The MOST LIKELY (not saying definitively) option is that it's from a result of climate change, due to the drastic decrease of ice sheets the polar bear most likely ran out of any significant area to hunt for prey (such as seals) that are very important to their diet to maintain their health. Thus, casuign the bear to starve. Now, that might not be the complete reason as to why the bear is starving, it's just the most likely scenario.

That this bear somehow didn't get the memo to migrate further north before the summer season melted everthing? If not those, then that maybe that the bear was already sickly, old and dying and so didn't make it a point to migrate this time? Or that maybe this footage was purposly posted on the internet over 6 months after filming it for dramatic effect when the northern hemisphere was experiencing its wintertime (North America, Europe, Russia)? So to maybe tug at the heartstrings of both normal people and global warming bleeding hearts alike so the population would believe this happened af few days ago as opposed to half a year ? Did anybody bother to notice how green the atric tundra was for this time of year? Or maybe that the white artic cotton grass and poppy blooms that only grow in the spring and summer months are somehow growing it what's supposedly the dead of winter for that location?

There are countless ecosystems in all areas of the world being thrown totally out of whack (especially in our oceans). You missed the point of using paper bags vs plastic bags lol, it's not in the production of it but what you can do with it AFTER. Plastic will take hundreds to thousands of years to degrade. Paper you can RECYCLE. It is biodegradable. I understand having opinions, but you should really eductae yourself on theese issues if you're going to be spreading misinformation as fact on the internet. Im not sure what kind of papers youre looking at, but I recommend ones that have high numbers of peer reviews, that way you know the information has been checked, reviewed and is sound. The internet is a great tool for knowledge if you don't go to school for this stuff.

Paper bags are better because they can DECOMPOSE and not last for thousands of years like plastic. 3. Spreading misinformation like this worsens the problem and Mother Nature had mass extinctions because of things that were out of organism control, they were unpreventable. Currently, this mass extinction is being caused by US HUMANS, therefore it is preventable. Stop spreading lies and maybe we'll actually get somewhere.

If you have an IQ above room temperature you know global warming is a scam. When a scientist says, &quot;most scientists agree that....(insert lie here)&quot;. Fact: there are more polar bears today than there have been in the past. If temperature has increased , and are killing them, why are there more? Polar bears are fine, this one is sick. 3/4 of a degree in 20 years....pfft.	UCcSMCHKh1Y-TDeFJmloPFng	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcSMCHKh1Y-TDeFJmloPFng	0

I think that question would be difficult to answer, but to rule out that man's impact on earth over the last century hasn't been devastating would be naive. Many of us have grown up with chemical wars (and threats of more!), oil spillage, wildfires, plastic pollution, air pollution, aerosols, methane, over-hunting, etc etc etc These (and much more) affect the homeostasis and ecosystems of the planet. People who feed into climate change conspiracies are extraordinarily naive.

(No diseases, health problems, disabilities, etc.) So now that we know that it's the starvation that killed him, there are only a limited amount of options as to how he became so thin. The MOST LIKELY (not saying definitively) option is that it's from a result of climate change, due to the drastic decrease of ice sheets the polar bear most likely ran out of any significant area to hunt for prey (such as seals) that are very important to their diet to maintain their health. Thus, casuign the bear to starve. Now, that might not be the complete reason as to why the bear is starving, it's just the most likely scenario.

This bear could have been sick, old, or had suffered an injury. This summer I flew over northern Ontario (southern limit of polar bears) and saw over 35 polar bears in 10 min, all very healthy looking. It is more complicated than finding a sick bear and saying climate change is affecting all polar bears. Where are the stats, surveys, proof of evidence?!

The drum contains old seal parts with no flesh, garbage, like bones and cartilage. That's why he didn't eat that, it's a skull. The bear was hoping it had even a pound of edible mass on it. A bear that close to death should be fed a good 250 lbs of meat to get closer to normal.

The rate of rising has nearly doubled in the last two decades. (for example, it use to take 20 years to the sea level to rise 1 inch, now it takes 10) 16: Number of record-breaking hottest years since 2000. 2016 was the hottest year yet. 1.5 degrees: The average worldwide temperature increase in Fahrenheit compared to a century ago. (remember this is in relation to worldwide CLIMATE and temperature, not country based or continent-based) 400 parts per million: Average concentration since 2016 of CO2 in the atmosphere, compared to 275 PPM for past 400,000 years. 9: The 9 most explosive fires in America's history have all occurred since 2000, with 2015 having the biggest fire (10.1 million acres burned) in American history. 19th century: When the heat-trapping nature of CO2 was first demonstrated. 30 percent: The increase in acidity of the world's oceans. $180 billion: Estimated economic losses to the United States by end of the century if no action is taken on climate change.

UgwL1dvg2pughoFXOMx4AaABAg	28	614	2017-12-09 19:18:17	Sebastian Sahrakar	To everyone that hasn&#39;t read the article, the reason this polar bear is dying is because the polar bear&#39;s main hunting place is on the ice sheets waiting for seals. There is currently diminishing ice sheets and in turn no place to hunt, and considering that polar bears need an incredible amount of fat and protein to maintain their massive size (i.e. a seal), unfortunately this guy will die very soon. <br /><br />Please stop saying they should have fed the bear, humans should never feed wildlife like this. It creates an unnatural environment where animals learn to rely on human interaction for their source of food. Would have simply prolonged the slow death of the bear for another couple of days.

My point was that THIS particular one would not successfully hunt down ANY animal with or without snow/ice. And yes I do agree now if few months back there was more ice (+seals) he wouldn't be so weak.

You can also see that in the structure and fur it's not a very old bear at all. What might look like 'old age' at first glance is actually muscular atrophy due to starvation. You can see by the way that the skin clings to the bone and the muscles are worn down heavily. In an older animal these things will happen but not as much as we're seeing in the video and not in the same ways. The ribs, for instance, wouldn't be as pronounced as they are and the muscle around the torso would still be quite dense in an elder bear. Hope that clears some things up. I'm no expert, but I do know some about muscle deterioration and fur discolouration aging (dilution) genes. This bear is a young one.

That this bear somehow didn't get the memo to migrate further north before the summer season melted everthing? If not those, then that maybe that the bear was already sickly, old and dying and so didn't make it a point to migrate this time? Or that maybe this footage was purposly posted on the internet over 6 months after filming it for dramatic effect when the northern hemisphere was experiencing its wintertime (North America, Europe, Russia)? So to maybe tug at the heartstrings of both normal people and global warming bleeding hearts alike so the population would believe this happened af few days ago as opposed to half a year ? Did anybody bother to notice how green the atric tundra was for this time of year? Or maybe that the white artic cotton grass and poppy blooms that only grow in the spring and summer months are somehow growing it what's supposedly the dead of winter?

But bear in mind this is not an honest depiction, that bear is sick not just "starving" and I'll wager c"climate change" had nothing to do with this animal's situation. Judging by the video itself, the animal looks old and close to death due to natural causes not starvation. We have to be extremely careful how we react to thing, and be wary of anyone who is using emotional appeals to try and persuade people over verifiable data and statistics. Emotional appeals are meant to make you react in an irrational manner, which can cause you to act in haste and without realizing you're being manipulated. It's what con men do all the time, it's the exact same tactic.	UCFCZ0ECWGWTrNaIfI1vH3OA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFCZ0ECWGWTrNaIfI1vH3OA	1	UgxbGhORuvUJiqBYyj54AaABAg	El Swift

That this bear somehow didn't get the memo to migrate further north before the summer season melted everthing? If not those, then that maybe that the bear was already sickly, old and dying and so didn't make it a point to migrate this time? Or that maybe this footage was purposly posted on the internet over 6 months after filming it for dramatic effect when the northern hemisphere was experiencing its wintertime (North America, Europe, Russia)? So to maybe tug at the heartstrings of both normal people and global warming bleeding hearts alike so the population would believe this happened af few days ago as opposed to half a year ? Did anybody bother to notice how green the atric tundra was for this time of year? Or maybe that the white artic cotton grass and poppy blooms that only grow in the spring and summer months are somehow growing it what's supposedly the dead of winter for that location?

If you can't change global warming at least start small. Besides, don't you think feeding this polar bear, then being arrested would have created a much more global uprising than just sitting 100 ft away and filming it. I guarantee the person who would have feed it would have made an impact and difference in policy.

Do you know how hard it is to hit a shot like that, and do you have any idea how long it would take the bear to get unconscious? And how do you expect it would react, when it's shot with a dart like that? Run away, when it's that hungry? In case you missed the points: 1. They didn't have darts, the gun to use it or the expertise 2. They didn't have any means of transportation for one of the largest, most dangerous predators on land 3. Attempting to do so even with the transportation and tranquilizer dart is extremely dangerous, and the bear probably wouldn't have survived the journey. It was dying. It's quite clear from the pictures.	UCNjW1i-rZ9l4Efvv23u3esQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNjW1i-rZ9l4Efvv23u3esQ	1	Ugzmcn7mkAkJ4kLq2Qp4AaABAg	Big time AL

Humans annually release 60X more carbon then volcanoes do in the same year, so we are a force Beyond what the natural environment can produce.

The point is to inform people that polar bears are starving because it‚Äôs too hot. This video is clear evidence of that fact. Sure, this one sick bear does not mean the world is ending... but I hope you understand that the polar bear is the tundra‚Äôs king of the food chain. If the polar bear population decreases dramatically, then we could see a proliferation of the polar bears prey which can likely cause a chain reaction of endangered species and prolific species. The polar bear eats the seal, no polar bears, more seals. The seals eat squid, crustaceans, Molluscs and other fish. More seals, less calamari, lobster, crab, and other delicious seafood. Which is huge market in tourism and hospitality. So the extinction of the polar bear could lead to the extinction of your favorite seafoods....

This isn't their fault, or the medias fault. They are trying to make people aware of the situation so we can do something on a larger scale. Feel good puff pieces just make people think that someone else is taking care of the situation so why should I do anything, while footage showing the actual suffering is more likely to set people in motion.

Growing up in Phoenix, yes it always got hot, but back in the 80s, we saw tons more thunderstorms during the summer, and it would cool down to the 70s, and now it just hovers around a hundred every night. And it was beyond rare to get temperatures over 108. Come to Phoenix and experience the lovely heat! Not! Plus you've gone a hundred plus days without rain. And look at the fires in California.

If you really are that broke up because some animal in nature dies every now and again the only way to prevent it is to kill them all so they can't die anymore. With tens of thousands of polar bears alive you're constantly going to have polar bears dying from this that and the other because nothing lives forever. No amount of power or money given to government will stop the climate from inevitably changing like it always has. And no amount of money or power given to government will stop creatures on planet Earth from being mortal.

Higdon‚Äè @jeffwhigdon Dec 9 More Osteosarcoma, a type of bone cancer, has been recorded in PB (griz too). Source is "Zoobiquity: What Animals Can Teach Us About Being Human", a 2012 book by Dr. B.N.

But it's fairly common in dogs (leading cause of death in golden retrievers, according to that book) and many of the symptoms described are being shown by that PB. 3 replies 11 retweets 79 likes Reply 3 Retweet 11 Like 79 Direct message Jeff W.

The problems in that places are created by their own fellow country men. Isn't it? Most of these kind of problems are only in a specific religion" dominating countries. If their fellow countries who also have this specific religion, don"t even have the attitude to help them, who need to save them? The world is doing enough to support them and also suffer because of this "help". I am talking about animals who are not fighting for religion, but for food and an environment to live.

And they didn't want to go within the area of no snow which is his home, his land that he stays on. So there aren't animals in the SNOW area for the polar bear to eat, which means that the animals would be there but because there is NO SNOW the animals aren't there he will starve.

The main problem here is that big industry has such a vice grip on economics and politics that they're able to pollute and abuse the planet because it puts more money into their pocket. If we can stop said industries and actions, there can and will be an eventual change. It may not happen overnight, but the Earth can heal.

Most likely sending cattle and "agriculture" would further displace wildlife and make polar bears more inept at hunting. Also that doesn't help the actual climate and geography of the arctic. Stopping climate change is the ONLY way we can save this.	UCEdeyUmDCr5W_E0oRtjIdQg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEdeyUmDCr5W_E0oRtjIdQg	1	UgxB1SWBI4BjOofOinB4AaABAg	Raven Rose
