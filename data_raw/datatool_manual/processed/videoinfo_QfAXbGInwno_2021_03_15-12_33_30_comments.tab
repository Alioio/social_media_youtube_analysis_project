Everyone wanted to go outside, everyone knew the best option was to just be quite for ten minutes, but we couldn&#39;t do it. there would always be someone who tried to be funny and get attention at the expense of everyone else&#39;s fun.

We have individuals (countries) acting in their own self-interests (money and power) that does not produce the optimal outcome compared to cooperating (climate change damages will in long term exceed short term costs). - Their best interests - Everyone has an interest in there being a future that won't inculde massive problems with nature; storms, floods, rising oceans, fires and related damages, relocations etc. These damages will, in the long term, be much higher than the cost of "going green" by changes to infrastructure, politically financial policies; greenhouse gas taxes/new techologies subsidies etc. - Why they might not cooperate - It demands actions today that require planning, (re)education, money and related challenges economically and to current power structures. It's hard to agree on a common agreement with all countries, as even the same rules for everyone would still shift money and power around, which the injured party refuses and changing the agreement to one side would likely make the other party disagree. Add that to low costs of keeping fossil fuels, financial barrier of entry to infrastructure utilizing new technologies, and you then get countries which have something to gain in the short term by not switching to more environmentally friendly systems. And political parties are usually for rather limited durations and puts pressure on to show results today, not in 10 years, so they have less of an incentive to push far future thinking policies into effect unless citizens vote for and demand it.

They are made for us, bought by us, used by us, but all the CO2 is produced elsewhere. It's easily about the same size as the in-country emissions. And what most people don't want to hear - methane is also a greenhouse gas. Gas drilling, pipelines all leak methane, and not even in small quantities. And then there's the part noone wants to hear: industrial meat production, with beef being the biggest contributor.

Those energy sources will always be unreliable. How can a manufacturing plant, that will help bring people out of poverty with employment, be built if they don‚Äôt have reliable energy? Not everywhere has hydroelectric capabilities. Nuclear and LNG is the answer right now. Solar and wind also have the battery problem. Batteries technology is not capable at the moment. Even if we can make large enough batteries to store power. How long do the batteries last and how do we dispose of them and how do we get the amount of rare earth materials to supply the demand of all the batteries needed? Solar and wind are a pipe dream that only makes sense on individual supplemental scale to lower your energy bill.

And why is it relevant that EU and US are allies?! It's like you have answered 70% in the wrong conversation.

The US could invest in a proper public transit system for example. You need fewer planes if you can hop on a decently priced high-speed train to at least every major city in the US. For example, in the Netherlands, the entire railway system is powered by wind energy and has been for years. A decent railway network could also reduce the reliance on trucks. Next to that, just think of the amount of emissions and toxic chemicals required to make the batteries.	UC9eZvunwQSVQCdXLGPtClvQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9eZvunwQSVQCdXLGPtClvQ	0

Regardless though, nuclear is only good as a baseline power source and needs a flexible power source to supplement it. Today, it is supplemented with coal, but this is where solar can shine (pun intended). Eventually, solar can even supply 100% of electricity needs, as it can be setup to be extremely flexible AND consistent, though that will only be economically possible once space launch costs fall significantly further.

You see it in the attitude towards masks - "If they only REDUCE the virus and don't cure it then what is the point in them?". Other countries also suffer from these same issues but America is a particularly extreme example. Increasing efficiency and reducing usage where possible might not be as helpful as switching energy sources, but it still helps. Electric trains are admittedly not best suited to hauling freight, but that doesn't mean that they can't or shouldn't be used to haul passengers, and an electrified rail network can transport thousands of people an hour at significantly faster speeds than by car, particularly given the traffic problems in America's mega cities. Given that most people in America commuting by car travel alone, if just 1000 people chose to commute into LA by a new high-speed train for example, that would be almost 1000 cars off the road from both an emissions standpoint AND a congestion standpoint - and with regular services the numbers would likely be a lot higher. Add in a well designed metro service and more comprehensive bus routes and you clear tens of thousands more, as a lot of LA traffic is from people within the city having to hop on and off the interstates for short distances to get anywhere. Yes, it would be extremely expensive in the short term, and it would take some time to set up, but it would benefit ALL LA citizens - not just those who use it. Less cars means less traffic, so people who want/need to drive can get to places faster. Less cars also means less emissions, which both benefits the climate and improves local air quality, improving the health of residents - particularly those with asthma. The cost of a train ticket is also generally equal to the cost of driving the same distance once you take into account fuel, insurance, maintenance, etc. and in most European countries with nationalised/government-run rail systems trains are SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper. Also, in reducing the time spent commuting (read: stuck in traffic), it means that workers can get to work on time easier, can leave home later and get home earlier, and arrive at work happier, more well-rested, and more productive, which ultimately will help the local economy. As for how to pay for it: increase taxes on the 1% i.e. the people that own 20% of the wealth in America and some of whom have enough money to buy a small to medium sized country. Simple.

TL;DR the more money is put into them the less profitable they become, and the same is true if you take money away. It was talking about how there's this American mentality that public transportation is not ideal, and you only use it if necessary. Not for convenience. It's looked down upon. Ok, easy enough. Make public transportation higher quality and use policy incentives to make people use it more. The issue there is that a lot of American politicians have ties to car/vehicle companies or represent districts that rely partially on those industries, so they refuse to make any policy to change the current system. It's a whole mess.	UCS6FJJYpIQwKONxb9o-jKGQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS6FJJYpIQwKONxb9o-jKGQ	1	UgyQA39cT9CrHQtZ17F4AaABAg	Pascal Smit

Nuclear fuels, as with petroleum/gas/coal, will run out eventually, the switch to solar will have to be made at some point. I‚Äôve noticed another comment of yours regarding battery technology. Large scale battery storage is becoming more and more viable, and will continue to do so as the necessity of increases. Nuclear power is only viable as a short term stop gap in the transition to renewable energy. The quicker that transition is made, the longer nuclear power can be held in reserve for emergencies. Solar power is almost certainly the only long term viable option.	UC5vx3BoGu3TqByJUSarmDmQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5vx3BoGu3TqByJUSarmDmQ	1	UgyQA39cT9CrHQtZ17F4AaABAg	Pascal Smit

The series 0 can go 177 MPH now (but we are using an average speed of 145 MPH), so it would roughly take 2 hours and 40 minutes, give or take. But since we have bullet trains that can go 300 MPH, that could take around an hour. An average (modern) freight train can go... ‚ÄúFreight trains must go at least 10 miles per hour below the speed limit, but not less than 30 miles per hour.‚Äù So let‚Äôs say 10 MPH for holding max capacity, (60 cars holding 125.5 tons each) 17,160,000 LB It would take 30 hours give or take to make a shipment that large. If a bullet train takes 1 hour to haul around 90,000 LBs (300 MPH ones) it can‚Äôt even compare to the ones that can haul the 17 million LBs that takes 30 hours.

Almost all nuclear and fossil-fuel energy created is stored in water and kinetic storage, because a consistent, even supply is significantly more important to the stability of the energy grid. Energy _storage_ is a much harder, and much more necessary challenge to battle right now than energy production. The solutions we need for renewable energy sources is to find efficient storage means for these. Then they can begin to properly compete with the fossil fuels. And no, orbital solar power plants are a not a good idea. They're a terrible idea in fact. To capture enough energy to be able to send it down to the ground in a usable fashion, it would need to be large enough that it would prevent significant portions of the ground below from receiving _any_ solar energy, killing flora and fauna on drastic scales, and then being incredibly inconsistent with having to orbit, and the storage solution not being solved, it would cause significantly more harm than it could ever possibly help.

I don't think that is a good idea, period. No matter what that storage device is. Batteries, water, kinetic storage, doesn't matter. It is always better to produce exactly what you need at any given time, and neither wind nor solar do fulfill that criterium. Basing your entire civilization on that is simply not a good idea, when you have other forms of energy production available. Only good place for solar on earth is a few hundred miles above it, where the sun is always shining. But there, it will be spectacular.

If anything, we will want to continue to increase our energy usage as we advance technologically, and that is a good thing. As technology advances, we discover more options of dealing with the problems of today. The only part I disagree with you on is that solar isn't the way to produce more energy (I do agree with you about wind energy. It's too volatile and doesn't scale well). I think there is a lot of room for growth for solar power, including efficiency, scale, and location.

There is a very small amount of energy you can save by optimizing the system, but making sure the door of your fridge is always closed will not even remotely impact the incredible amount of power needed to produce steel or ceramics, to create ammonia or pharmaceutics or to pasteurize a gazillion liters of milk every day. Those are expenditures that will always be there, and need to be there to uphold civilization. You do not save the world by consuming less energy. You save it by finding a way to produce more. Nuclear might be that way. Solar and wind are almost certainly not.	UCrCyIKhdovAkLPK78dBW6Ng	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrCyIKhdovAkLPK78dBW6Ng	1	UgyQA39cT9CrHQtZ17F4AaABAg	Pascal Smit

It's doable, but renewable and more efficient energy sources are likely more easy to achieve (less red tape to work around, less inter-government bodies needed to collaborate etc.). Outside the major cities, North America lacks the density needed to make anything beyond inner city public transit a viable option and most of those cities have options. They could be better mind you, but they're there. Inter-city travel is another ballgame altogether. The United States alone has almost twice the landmass of the entire European Union, but "only" 330M people inside it (compared to 500M+ in EU). How do you convince everyone that there is a viable high speed train solution that can connect so few people (relatively speaking) across such large distances?

Unlike the carbon dioxide released by burning fossil fuels, which just gets emitted as a gas into the atmosphere and can do all sorts of damage, spent nuclear fuel is solid and can be stored. You'd need to build a long-term waste storage facility underground, but it's entirely doable.

Ohh hey, yeah, tritium is the thing anti nukes complain the most about current plants "leaking" into water sources, and you want a reactor which intentionally produces it? What about the metals which absorb neurons during operation which become radioactive? There is plenty of waste in fusion that will need storage, just like fission. Given fusion's perpetual "a decade away", fission represents an easy way to decarbonize the grid and fast. France did it in about 15 years by using a standardized plant design. The US could probably do it quicker given our construction prowess.	UCxCRnJcVb_CGvKHAOsHNd2g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxCRnJcVb_CGvKHAOsHNd2g	1	UgyOEtcBsp5aBMbcxvN4AaABAg	Nomad624

The carbon from those are much more "loose", let's say. It's already in the carbon cycle and has been actively circulating, unlike fossil fuels, which have long been isolated underground. Burning wood is not entirely green (especially not very old, very large trees; those are a great repository of atmospheric carbon), but its a lot better than fossil fuels.

It would be interesting to see how that is being calculated as the intensity of climatic events hasn‚Äôt declined, while the quantity has largely increased. In my opinion a lower death rate would be more akin to the increase in structural design for buildings to prevent human loss of life than any real indication that climatic events and severity of climatic events have decreased.

The argument is a fallacy, or at least some perverted, defeatist form of the prisoners dilemma. The truth is that without the US commiting it will be virtually impossible.

Those are conveniently put out on their own column in their analysis. Interestingly enough, they happen to be the two most expensive ways to get electricity (gas peaking and battery based storage). When you factor those in, and they are requirements to renewable heavy areas due to intermittent generation (capacity factors in the 30% range for the high end of both) and grid instability. When you put them together, as is required, the total LCOE is eye wateringly expensive. That's a partial explanation as to why France, ~70% nuclear, has nearly half the electrical cost of Germany (about 30% renewables and subsidized expansion). France also has significantly less CO2 per capita too...	UCxCRnJcVb_CGvKHAOsHNd2g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxCRnJcVb_CGvKHAOsHNd2g	1	UgzLIQfFSQ6eNXLo8v94AaABAg	Midgard Eagle

You would have a few, and that's all. The proof is that after the end of the cold war the construction of new ones dropped drastically, and after a small spike in 2009-20213 they bombed again. In economical terms this is like the coal industry: despite a lot of plants keep working, the operative cost aren't just competitive vs filling some desertic area with PV or building an offshore wind farms. and about "There is a precedent for nuclear being extremely effective in France and Japan", well, Japan plans to reduce their nuclear electric production from the 30% to the 20%, and in France, well, in 2017 Areva crumbled and all his business and reactores were buyed by EDF, with at the current moment is on the verge to achieve the same status. Let me displan an extract from the Wikipedia page: "EDF's net debt at the end of 2018 was ‚Ç¨33 billion, but with future obligations such as pension liabilities and costs for managing nuclear waste allowed for, adjusted net debt was ‚Ç¨70 billion. In order to improve EDF's finances, as of 2019 EDF has sold ‚Ç¨10 billion of assets, with plans to sell a further ‚Ç¨2 to ‚Ç¨3 billion of assets by 2021, and shareholders have been allocated new shares rather than a cash dividend. Bonds have been issued in Asian currencies to expand sources of funding." So, DESPITE being almost a full electric monopoly in France, and operating currently 58 nuclear reactors just in that country, EDF is UNABLE to assume its debts, and faces a precarious future (its Hinkley Point C power plant in construction in UK in tandem with China General Nuclear is flopping had in terms of economics). Also, Flamanville 3 has been an utter disaster (x4 the original budget, three times delayed, etc.). If the most expert, well versed companies in the market of the civilian nuclear energy are struggling so hard, why should we put money in new reactors? As I said: the main goal was never to have a sustaineable bussiness, but to get an amazing stockpiles of (now rusting) nukes. Once you ditch of the equation the money from Uncle Sam, nuclear reactors just don't make sense, in terms of finances. Because people didn't saw the forest: making energy was never the reason this heavily subsidized industry was pushed. I'm not demanding the cease of use of current reactors in operation (they should remain until they reach their projected life time or untill they are unable to complain with the increasing requirements in the laws), but I'm opposed to waste money in new ones (aside the ITER and similar research facilities). That's my stance.	UC3rRjSPT2ADF8Bx3SFTUn_g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3rRjSPT2ADF8Bx3SFTUn_g	1	UgzLIQfFSQ6eNXLo8v94AaABAg	Midgard Eagle

Because believe it or not the field does know when to give up on dead ends. Such as when they figured out that plasma bottles wouldn't be a productive way to confine plasma in a fusion reactor. Once they saw it was too innefective to be plausible, they stopped pursuing it. If fission didn't have a basis, people wouldn't still being pursued.

I was pointing out that is blatantly untrue. Yes the means of mining the uranium is the same. Yes both have to be enriched ( bombs needing much more highly enriched). But No, there was no scientist using a power plant to solve the mystery about making bombs. Just like they weren't exploring nuclear medicine to make bombs.

That doesn't mean it should be given up on. It obviously does have a basis as a reliable power source, otherwise there wouldn't be at least one commercial power plant in a majority of states. There is a moral victory to be had with using nuclear. If you want to talk about the size of alternative power then we should talk about the acres of land needed for wind turbines, or the massive infrastructure needed to produce hydroelectric power. Trust me I would love for nuclear power to be just fusion but that's not in the picture yet (that doesn't mean it shouldn't be funded), but might as well take this hugely efficient form of power generation by the horns to produce sustainable carbon free energy. I will have to agree with you though that too many new reactors are too quickly abandoned because of outdated technology or the private company isn't getting a buck out of it. But it's not because fission can't work, it just doesn't work well in the US. There is a precedent for nuclear being extremely effective in France and Japan. The problem for America is putting too small of a bridle on the figurative horse that is Fission Reactors to effectively pull this figurative plough that is energy production. I'd also like to note that Nuclear is one of the newest forms of energy productions. It's a field where extremely intelligent people still don't have all the answers. As is true with everything, with time and resources come more understanding and innovations. The difficulties put forth are real but being worked on every day. Fission should not be so easily brushed aside.	UCSpZoDklAo6BYNgb4RDkJrw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSpZoDklAo6BYNgb4RDkJrw	1	UgzLIQfFSQ6eNXLo8v94AaABAg	Midgard Eagle

First: the process to produce fissible material to either fuel type II reactors incivilian power plants with uranium or plutonium or to make nuclear-grade weapons is the same, is only matter of purity. Once you have the tech for one you can make the other, that‚Äôs why the UN becames so nervous when third countries as Iran try to develop one in their own. Second: is safe to say that the proliferation of civilian reactors in countries as USA, Russia, China or France absolutely was pushed by the military goals: making all the fuel for weapins in a single facility is risky and slower than having a lot of the, Also, there were strategic implications: the best way to deliver nuclear weapons isn‚Äôt using silos, which are known and static, neither bombers, which are slow and easier to intercept than ICBMs, but from strategic nuclear submarines, which can operate underwater for years withour emerging or refuelling, and which have unpredictable locations. Currently USA has in operation 15 of those, working in cycles: 5 of them being refuelling, five on maintenance and 5 fully operative in the sea. To keep those working they need a lot of civilian engineeers running a lot of power plants, because those ships play critical role in the balance of power and you need all kind of experts to keep them functional. And third: is obvious why the civilian nuclear industry is always begging money: because is a non profitably activity. In any country, at any power plant, the founds for the huge upfront costs of the building and reasearch is always a goverment, a statal effort; then the plant is oftenly ruled by a private company until it becomes impossible to keep the opreative cost/retirement cost and then that company either enters in bankrupcy or pleads to the goverment the funds to dismantle it. A subsidized mess. If were profitable companies would be building their own facilities whitout begging funds as currently happens with renewables: wind farms and solar farms are built currently everywere oftenly without the need of any subsidy or external support. I do support the ITER due scientific research: is a hughely complex tech which has to prove if can run consistently, if can deliver more energy that it spents and if could be viable commecially, but would be good even it if fails because requires huge cooperation and pushes our tech. It will be useless in the first half of this century but anyway only cost a few cents compered to what we are spending in the spread of renewables. But for conventional fission reactors you don‚Äôt have my support: they are too expensive to build, too hard to scale down, too centralized and mostly because they aren‚Äôt cost effective. And also because if we would chose to built 500 new reactors starting today they wouldn‚Äôt be ready before 2030 and by that time if renewables + storage + changes in our productivity model didn‚Äôt happened they would arrive too late. The only argument weakly wielded against renewables by the pro nuclear is the intermitency, but guess that: just in Europe alone the EU recently estimated that by 2025 there will be over 10 millions of electric cars in their roads (and I think that is a conservative estimation). That alone would be 100 times more Kwh storage than Austalia‚Äôs Hornsdale Power Reserve. Combined with the European supergrid and also hydrogen storage I don‚Äôt think we would have any problem with our base power load. Pro-nuclear are trying to sell Blackberrys in a iPhone world. Just won‚Äôt happen.	UC3rRjSPT2ADF8Bx3SFTUn_g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3rRjSPT2ADF8Bx3SFTUn_g	1	UgzLIQfFSQ6eNXLo8v94AaABAg	Midgard Eagle

No amount of nuclear power production was necessary in devising nuclear bombs. nuclear bombs are much more simple then power plants. Split an atom, wait for the boom. Power plants require moderation and oversight to produce an environment that can adequately chain together a bunch of reactions without going overboard and creating to much energy to overload your reactors. Operating cost isn't why Nuclear fields ask for so much money. Reactors run for at least a year on one fuel cycle. The reason they ask for so much money is because the infrastructure to expand, research, and fund the complicated process of splitting atoms is really difficult and expensive. It is an investment that will pay off big. It is a new-ish field with so much potential, but that potential comes with a price tag. Fusion is another super big and expensive aspect of nuclear that could change the renewable fuel game. It should not be underestimated.

It is the same cost being paid for in the infrastructure for fossil fuels. The differentiating point is that nuclear uses a fraction of fuel used for fossil fuels to produce massively more amounts of energy. That in itself should be enough, but I understand that there is still skepticism. The waste seems to be of some issue to people, but the waste is relatively harmless to the environment. It doesn't emit any carbon, it only emits heavy charged particles that, if stored properly, can do no harm. It is also worth mentioning that the current nuclear waste on the planet could be easily stacked into a football field speaks to just how little waste is produced in the grand scheme of things.

After a fission reactor depletes all of its uranium and fully goes through its decay chain, which takes years and produces massive amounts of energy compared to its mass, the depleted uranium can be re-enriched and mixed with plutonium byproduct from the reactor to make mox fuel or mixed-oxide fuel. it is done in france and serves as a good secondary fuel cycle. However the bigger point you are alluding to is that nuclear waste is for the most part unusuable. However, as previously commented on there is a lot of research that uses depleted uranium and when stored properly whether by encasing it in concrete or burying it underground is harmless to the environment. Remember its not just depleted uranium that is radioactive, unmined uranium is radioactive too and its been underground for millions of years. It is actually quite a powerful stigma to say something is radioactive, but in reality it depends on what type of radiation. The radiation emitted from the used fuel is a very slow decay rate, meaning that not a lot of energized particles are being expelled from the material. Also, the particles being spit out are big alpha particles that have very small ranges that can be blocked by a couple feet of earth. I hope this is informative for you, the Nuclear stigma is alive and kicking but it is important to overcome that for a brighter more energy efficient future.

Nuclear power plants are extremely carbon demanding with building materials, as they need a LOT of concrete and steel. They also aren‚Äôt exactly net zero emissions because the waste from the plants have to go somewhere.

As we've see with these disasters, when things go wrong they go badly wrong, so we need to be very careful and judicious about where we can put nuclear plants, but each technology has its + and - points mainly depending on location, so we shouldn't leave out any option that can help deliver a solution.

The energy grid would need to be overhauled to account for the various inconsistencies solar would bring, not to mention the math involved to insure the harmonic frequencies involved don't blow your transformers. Not to mention if you wanted to go 100% solar you would need enough batteries to store more than a day's worth of energy to survive the night and times with little sun. The true cost of a pure solar grid are astronomically higher than coal one you start accounting for more than just what generates power.

With more and more people coming into the world and wanting comforts that's a fools dream. We haven't even seen the real big hits yet. That's why China and India are ramping up power with more coal plants because people are demanding more. While they have a lack of infrastructure it would be perfect to utilize newer "cleaner" energy sources but they have found that it would cost them far too much which is why they are going with coal.

And that's not even mentioning the damage he has done to the earth physically by supporting the fossil fuel industry, or how about how he canceled Obamacare, the stepping stone for a great health care program!

Corporation blame consumers for the use of plastic and encourage people to switch to paper based product but here's the thing. Corporations produce the most plastic waste and paper isn't the best alternative because it costs more to make and less durable. I won't deny the bad effect of plastic to the environment but I need people to understand the waste of the whole population is just a fraction compare to the waste of corporations dumping out every year.

The point is your (well not you personally) biggest contribution against climate change was leaving an inspirational/woke quote on a video. And considering the quote's message, it's pretty hypocritical do literally be the person you are talking about. Yes billionaire stipulated the use of fossil fuel, but was it you that decided "you know, I'm actually going to make an impact." Yes billionaire in the end produce more carbon dioxide that most of us, and yes they own companies that do so, but it's us that sit silently as they do it. Yes the system is rigid against us, but what stops you from organizing an actual protest, or start lobbying, and instead you chose to do nothing, like a comment making fun of people you despise, without realizing that you also fall into that category. I know I am doing almost the same thing, and you can never change anyone's opinion, especially on the internet, but I have a good excuse. I can't vote. Period. I have school work I need to do, which at this point is a bigger priority for me and the world, as it will hopefully make me a net positive later. Sorta rant over.

It will create thousands of jobs, it will benefit people who live on land that has strong wind, people who have access to rivers, and companies that are able to build these new plants to create energy. Yes there will be jobs lost in the oil industry, but they can transfer to clean energy. Also, I‚Äôm okay with having a few people lose their jobs if it means we all don‚Äôt live in the after math of global climate change ...

It would also affect my family because we have land with mineral rights and I have family members whose jobs are in the oil and gas industry.

We can't give them the fault, that they didn't go to school, because back then the climate change wasn't recognised by many humans and back then they were children, who had problems, a depression , unmotivation or the parents didn't worried about the child's future and let their to a position, which harmed the future of their child by doing damages to the enviroment. My conclusion is, that it is very hard to answer the question:"Who is the fault", because it has many perspectives, opinions and even more parameters. It is unresponsible to blame it on the generations before us and should blame ourselves for not doing something against the climate change, because we have now the power to decide. I thank everyone, that makes something against the climate change and i wish to all people a good day. I hope nobody is offended by this text.

Coal production increased 3.3% in 2018, 4 of the 6 worlds largest producers increased their output, with 3 of them Russia, India and Indonesia producing their largest outputs ever. 40% of the worlds electricity is generated by coal. Its not going anywhere soon. The reason fossil fuel companies and big banks invest in renewables is because they know they require a reliable backup source due to their intermittency, primarily a natural gas or coal powered plant. There are no examples of C02 neutral mining or of any proceses involving the production of energy being C02 neutral, including renewables.

That's why to win their votes, one has to cater to their anxieties and take those angles. The other side of the spectrum sees thing in more progressive terms, which isn't always as good as it may inherently sound. There's spending to consider and like he said in the video, many of the ideas are ambitious and quite frankly idealistic. I'd say we need steady but gradual transition that would put us on pace to at least slow down the rise in global temp. It's palatable for both sides but at least it gets us moving in the right direction rather than a step forward and two steps back.

So it would be transferring workers and jobs instead of destroying. Of course then the fossil fuel companies would go down, but if they were incentivized to put their millions of dollars into developing renewable energy instead, just imagine how it could be advanced. Fossil fuels now don‚Äôt have a lot of room for growth, but renewable energy is still developing. Makes sense for companies to switch too ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø already renewable energy jobs outnumber fossil fuel jobs 3-1.

I think that the jobs lost from the fossil fuel companies that already exist is considered to be worse than the creation of jobs in a new industry is considered good. Not to say I support this logic, but I think that people are less likely to recognise the opportunity when it would disadvantage the system that's already in place. Another argument that comes up is that to completely change the direction of the energy industry costs A LOT of money. (just getting solar panels is more expensive than other systems). The overall cost over many years is smaller but the initial cost is demoralising for some and debilitating for others.

Our infrastructure has become substandard. Rural areas need internet. There's plenty of work to do, just doesn't have to do with fossil fuels anymore. Energy companies might be the losers, but I have trouble feeling bad for them when they should have been leading the charge instead of clinging to their old way of doing things. They tell us we can recycle plastic, but about 90% of it ends up in landfills and the ocean. Can't go on like that.

Their electricity is one of the most expensive in the EU. For instance, in my country, it's 10 times cheaper. Though it's better to be compared to France, which generates most of its electricity from nuclear, while Germany reduced its nuclear input down to 11-12%. It's also important to mention that they had major changes in electric efficiency and consumption, which required a lot of funding but were beneficial. I can't even imagine how to do it for large countries like the US, Russia or China. By the way, Germany's wind power turbines haven't been created in a 'green' way.

Solar and wind are intermittent and cant even replace electricity production which is only a fraction of overall energy use. There are no viable cost effective solutions for replacing fossil fuels when it comes to heating, transport and agriculture. Eliminating the use of fossil fuels would mean returning to a agrarian based society full of manual labour, lower life expectancy, the demise of modern medicine which relies heavily on petroleum byproducts and reliable energy sources. Agriculture would be decimated without diesel fuel and natural gas fertilizer which would eventually lead to mass starvation.

You can't just have the dude that just checks a dial for 20k a year manage an entire solar farm, can you? It will create a lot of jobs but a lot of untrained people would be pushed out, the thing is you can't just say that you're going to give jobs then give the wrong job, unless the government for example adopts a new law or something that manages the unemployed better and tries to train them by giving them cheaper student loans for school, etc. I am very much on the side for drastic change to combat climate change but politicians just aren't going to risk it especially for the leadership of the greatest economies to exist.

It's unclear how many temporary and permanent jobs would be gained from it, but especially in the transport sector with autonomous driving around the corner, mass unemployment will happen with a green package unless the government will stimulate overproduction.

Most Democrats and a majority of Republicans think something needs to be done to address climate change. Not to mention the youth whose lives are literally at stake here. Myself included.¬† The impetus is on current and future leaders from both parties to kickstart the energy revolution. People who don't feel the need to fight climate change need to wake up and realize we have so much to gain (jobs, tech, clean air) and everything to lose.

FDR's mobilization for war was not without controversy - some companies actually sued over being repurposed this way - and you'd see an even greater pushback today. FDR presided over a communitarian decade and had an extremely friendly Congress as well as the very real, literal enemies of the Axis powers. We have none of these factors at work. Mobilizing a federal effort that will fundamentally change the fabric of American life without those factors will be next to impossible.

Might have something to do with the need for gas peaking plants to deal with power generation when the wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine. Don't even bring up batteries. Batteries will never provide long term reliable energy in the midwest summers when the wind farms nearly completely shut off and there isn't enough land and water to make pumped storage viable.

You could make your own biodiesel and use that in a combustion engine. The curator of a museum should not have too much trouble ordering octane fuel and getting it delivered to the museum by electric truck. People who have classic car collections will keep their collections. Those types of things do not happen on a large enough scale to seriously effect climate.

Even we are just slowly scuffing and mostly still pretending to please those citizens that demand more action. Yes it's true, we do more, wind power, solar power. But that's stagnating now that the easy things are done. We might look good in relation to others, but that's only due to the sad fact that most of the world is doing even worse. But as a motivation: Many people in Germany have the opinion "Even if we go to 0% alone, it won't have the impact to the planet." So, if the USA decides to join in, it will motivate many in the whole world. You have to think: Yes, the world is looking at the USA, and yes, if you do something, many in the world will follow you.

Opponents of carbon reform have been saying that for years, but if we had started back in 2000 we wouldn't have had to implement them tomorrow. It's true that it's not feasible to switch to electric overnight, but we need to start and we need to start right now - not tomorrow - because the longer we wait the harder the transition will be. We've already made that transition period harder on ourselves.	UCyV40yWjTTx6gbgKWWB3uDA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyV40yWjTTx6gbgKWWB3uDA	1	UgxnIHRWenKHeCRXkmZ4AaABAg	Antonio E

Even the most ambitious countries (China, Germany) have 30-year plans to reduce carbon emissions, not bring them to zero. There has never been a period of history (even pre-human) where there were zero emissions. We need a carbon tax, particularly on non-electric vehicles, and we need to make more nuclear plants immediately. In the meantime, solar panels can start creating micro-grids that change the landscape of our energy production. BTW, wind is a scam, look it up. The technology simply hasn't gone anywhere; it's always paired with solar but the two are nothing alike in practicality.

What it does offer is the ability to extract carbon to better take control of global carbon levels since there is no plausible way for renewables to fill that goal seeing as the energy load that released that carbon was millions of years worth of solar radiation at least without it coming at the expense of an even greater cost to the planet. Getting off the horse of inaction is the most important thing for sure. Drastic action is needed or else humanity is hard broiled (i.e global temperatures and humidity will render outdoor environments to be unsurvivable for us due to our method of thermoregulation no longer working.

If small ones with a pully system connecting them use iron weights to store power, and share one generator to make electric, we dramaticly cut the copper and completely removed lithium.

You either accept the laws of nature or you don't. Laws of nature do not care about your beliefs or if you accept them. The gravity will affect in the same way a person who beliefs in it or the one who doesn't. Majority of politicians are not revolving about "believing in science". They are revolving around ridiculous scientific illiteracy. According to data, the majority of politicians come from a financial or legal background (education, career, etc), not scientific or engineering. It means that they have no training to be problem solvers. Scientists and engineers are trained to be problem solvers.

However to act like this isn‚Äôt an issue is just complete lunacy. At the end of the day the industry and the part of government that actually understands what is going on in the climate and the industry recognize that this is a problem, and they have solutions. Unfortunately media is either too uneducated, completely ignorant or just is unaware of the literal thousands published plans to deal with this issue. The easy part is recognizing there are solutions - the hard part is determining what is the best solution for the US and how that solution may change over time to reduce the impact of climate change	UCPhElDls_CdDcKtnsKMgqoA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPhElDls_CdDcKtnsKMgqoA	1	UgydLJG_z_rfPki5sBF4AaABAg	Financial Shinanigan

Some people claim that the increase is due to solar activity, however we happened to have these things callled satellites which have monitored solar activity for the last 50 years. This data combined with preliminary navigation and astrology reports on the sun (specifically on temp and sunspots) has shown over the last 100+ years the suns activity is relatively constant . Other people claim it‚Äôs due to cosmic rays and the solar systems position in our galaxy. However these changes occur over million year cycles and have never been replicated in a documented period of any other recorded time due to this claim. Other arguments are for the magnaclean periods which associate the relative tilt of the earth compared with periods of warming and cooling. However we are seeing significant increase in temperature rates at a time when our tilt is moving away from the sun. Other arguments claim that it‚Äôs GHGs but it can‚Äôt be anthropological. Problem is the we have seen a significant rise in carbon 13 specifically its concentration in the atmosphere which is industrial created not naturally created. Together all of these factors combined with the evidence fro anthropogenic climate change point to the issue described in the video. It‚Äôs very difficult to make a plausible argument against the current conclusion given the amount of data and same conclusive findings from multiple areas of science.

Most scientific energy transition plans are based on 30 year timeframes. However that means rates of production that are several magnitudes greater than today sustained every year for 30 years. It doesn‚Äôt mean we can put it off for 30 years. The greatest challenges are going to be in electricity and energy (heating, feedstock, fuels). Houses there are several ways to decarbonize. In fact the USA has one of the best programs in the world for building decarbonization called LEED, which is accepted by ACI, AIA, NEC, and ASTM.

Trump has dragged the Republican party to more extreme positions than we've seen before. Just think about how he's attacked Republicans like John McCain. Whereas other politicians like John McCain and Barack Obama have put country before party, Trump has put party before country and regarded people not of his party and even people of his party who he doesn't like as what I can only describe as his enemies.

Surely it‚Äôs better than having a president that not only doesn‚Äôt care about anything but that actively destroy any environmental protection put in place in the last decade, see the dakota pipeline or the oil excavations that trump authorized to be made in reserves in alaska.

Even if you manage to stabilize it, the cores will always corrode and be contamined. They need to be deposit. All atomic energy source has one major problem. It uses the second-strongest physical force, and the strongest we can actually use to produce energy. If something goes wrong, it's impossible to control anymore, because all other sources of force we can control are at least 10,000 times weaker. Ten-thousand times. So it's like you take a kitchen knife trying to force out Godzilla from your foregarden. We humans always think and try to control everything. Sometimes we just have to accept, that there are indeed some things, we just can't control completely. That's also the purpose why we in germany close the reactors. Merkel asked her experts just this: "Can we completely control this force in the reactors?" And they just truly answered: "No, we can't." So Merkel did , against her own will, what she must. She protected the people their care for she is responsible. Though fusion in general is actually less dangerous because you can effectively use it on lower scales, the main Problem stays. Also, as fas as i remember they build the first fusion cores like 20 years ago and weren't even able to build up a continuous self-containing fusion process yet. How you can even talk about the security of an energy source, you're not even able to set up? I doubt we'll get the first commercial fusion reactor before 2050, were we need to be carbon-free. But all the other truly renewable powers are actually already available, they are even commercial, they make profit. It just needs governmental funding to make their use accessable for all purposes and all people, so they can buy the machines needed to use them. And this is, what Biden is proposing to do. I doubt he would even consider closing reactors but he is willing to use all the energy sources which are indeed available now to do the change we need. And he isn't talking about fusion, because fusion isn't even available. Nobody can say when we could actually get the first commercial fusion reactor. 30 Years ago they said it could be now.They now say in 2050, IF they solve the issues they have... I doubt it.

The RBMK reactor has its flaws, but when operated correctly, the chances of another "Chernobyl" are very low. Chernobyl was a text book example of what happens when you blatantly ignore safety protocols and then put the reactor into an unstable configuration. Chernobyl also lacks a containment system like most modern reactors do. Three Mile Island and Fukushima are more representative of what modern nuclear reactor is like in "worst case scenarios" and they are far, far, far, far, far, far, far, far, far, far, far less damaging to the surrounding area... Fukushima lost three reactors and people are moving back into their homes inside the former exclusion zone.

I simply wanted to offer a little more information on the treatment of nuclear waste itself, which is a major problem. I read a little about fission, would reduce waste and its treatment, which I think that is very important and it may be the energy of the future. Thanks for sharing the info on solar and wind. I knew about solar limitation, that 35% efficiency I understand cannot be increased, it's a permanent limitation, so solar nor wind are possible to supply the world with energy.

The good news: it's all doable, so just get on with it. All the tech is mature enough, with plenty of room still for improvement. The bad news -- sort of -- it ***CAN'T BE DONE*** within the constraints of the current Neoliberal Economic Model. ***HOWEVER***, recently developed blockchain technology can eliminate this bottleneck, and provide the means to move past the Neoliberal Model. And I'm working on just such a program, so be on the lookout for some good news soon, when Pathfinder Energy International comes out of stealth mode.

NuScale's authorized in the US, Moltex is likely to open its waste-burner MSRs in Britain and Canada, ThorCon's working on their 2.2GW barge reactor for Indonesia. China's new coal power plants are designed modular so they can be converted to Thorium-fueled MSRs when they get their version ready. They're unrealized because not all of them are ready, but once they are, it's off to the races. What you need to consider is these companies haven't had much permission to innovate since the Nixon administration botched the U.S. nuclear program, and the Obama administration fell short of their promises to invest in advanced nuclear. True forward development has only really happened in the past 3 years, and both parties in congress had to back each other into a corner to agree on going for gen 4 nuclear. This is work that's been on hold since around 1972; research has gone missing, data needs to be re-collected and re-evaluated. It's going to take a while, but considering the pace of things so far, it should still begin happening within the next 5-10 years.

There are probably two dozen independent studies which confirm this. Off shore wind is like the third lowest in the list with nuclear just barely more life cycle co2. One aspect of mining left out is rare earth mining produces thorium which is a fertile nuclear fuel source which is more energy dense than just raw uranium and requires no enrichment to use in Molten Salt Reactors. I suggest you do some research on them. Older design but one which provides significantly higher levels of safety compared to the already really safe reactors in use today.

SC utility customers are paying extra on their bills for nuclear plants that will never generate a nanowatt. The Vogtle nukes in Georgia were started in 2013 and supposed to both be on-line in 2018. Those two are still under construction, with the original $14 billion in estimated costs now at $27 billion and expected to come on line in late 2021 and early 2022.

To others it's a non-renewable source pulled from the ground. Nuclear power is non-renewable. That doesn't mean it is bad from a climate change viewpoint, and it doesn't mean we need to cut back now, but it does mean it has a limited timescale and is not a complete solution and in fact will need to be a shrinking portion of the energy production budget within our lifetimes, unless the rate of uranium discovery unexpectedly starts increasing.

We are all trying to prevent warming and that means all options are on the table. I am a fan of nuclear but but we can't ignore that is has some drawbacks, as do all energy sources, nuclear being time for construction and cost of deconstruction. Wind and solar are increasingly becoming cheaper and the construction time can take 1 - 2 years in comparison to 5 - 10 year.

Fossil fuel doesn't mean anything mined from the ground used as fuel, it means chemical fuel mined from the ground. The difference is, fossil fuels release carbon as a waste product. Nuclear doesn't. That's the argument for nuclear- it's as consistent to run as coal, but as clean as or even cleaner than wind and solar (if you factor in manufacturing).

They're part of the Gen 4 nuclear program, and they just got authorized to enter production this year. They'll have a reactor power station running in Ohio by '23. Terrapower's not far behind, and they're using a molten salt heat reservoir attached to their reactor as a grid battery, they can boost their 300 MW reactor to 500 peak for demand spikes. Once they blaze the path, MSRs should start moving along fast. We're on the edge of glory, folks!

Ugwqjl84VUQFSDBlN814AaABAg	2	13	2020-09-22 07:24:04	Graham X	This will take a carrot and stick approach. For the stick the US needs to:<br />- Implement a carbon tax that scales quickly over the next decade or so<br />- Add a tax to gas/diesel vehicles based on CO2 efficiency as well as drastically increase taxes on the gas/diesel. It&#39;s important to do both to encourage more efficient vehicles for the future while also disincentivizing consumption for existing vehicles<br /><br />For the carrot these taxes should be pumped into subsidies. Making the taxes revenue neutral could help to sell the idea to the public (e.g. the federal carbon tax in Canada).<br />- Subsidies for non-CO2 energy production and/or consumption (solar, wind, nuclear, etc)<br />- Subsidies for non-CO2 emitting vehicles<br />- Subsidies for residential/commercial heating<br /><br />Basically the idea is to disincentivize the CO2 producing activities while using those funds to incentivize the corresponding non-CO2 producing activities. It&#39;s not even that difficult to do. Most wealthier countries around the world have been implementing these solutions (and others) for 10+ years now. There is even an economic incentive to do this as the countries that can be the leaders in the new industries will certainly have massive benefits.

They say we have caused warming, but we do not know to wich degree that has affected the local weather we see every day. We have absolutely no idea if those fires would have happened without human influence as well, no idea if they had been less or even more severe. To name another example, in Germany farmers are worrying about a drought that has been going on for a few yeas, but in Europe overall, there is no rain deficit. In other words, some regions of Europe are experiencing excess rainfall right now. This excess, and the increased agricultural production, must then also be caused by global warming, must it not? If you point at any given weather event and ask yourself, "to what percentage was this particular thing caused by humans", you will not find anyone who can give you a definite answer. If you search for any such numbers, you will find zilch. There is no visible link between extreme weather event and manmade global warming. Mostly because extreme weather events are not showing a clear trend, and neither are droughts. But deny that all you want.

There is no global trend in droughts currently. There is no global trend in extreme weather events either. The west coast is on fire rght now. It has been on fire in the past.

Some forms of democratic socialism advocate for communal or local planning, and some even advocate for a market economy. The last idea applies to me. I'm a market socialist. I want the economy to be built around democratic worker-co-ops, which are companies owned collectively by all its workers, rather than private companies. This model has had many successful instances across the world. I don't want a central state to run everything, in fact I don't want them to exist in their current form. I would move a lot of power from federal to local and communal governments if it were up to me.

That's an odd take, if so. Also, the government isn't some singular sentient being. It's a collection of systems put in place by people & their ideas. One of those ideas is Capitalism. A system that requires scarcity when there is none & a hierarchy that keeps a lot of people without their needs being met in order to make the rich richer. It's a system that prioritize profit above all else. There's a reason we have child labor laws & environmental protections. Capitalists have proven without disincentive to their bottom-line, they will put children in deadly work conditions & poison people. In my opinion, that's a form of evil.

Totalitarian isn't specific to socialism my guy. And even then, when a state provides a service that doesn't make it socialism. Socialism is when workers own the means of production, and if you can't tell, workers do not own the means of production in most societies today. Government services are run by bureaucracies instead. Now that we have semantics of of the way, we can't expect the same economic system to get us out of this mess that it has ignored for the longest time. We need radical solutions to climate change as the video showed and as of right now, our economic system prioritizes fossil fuel industries. Capitalism prioritizes short term profit over sustainability, and we can't expect capitalism to suddenly prioritize sustainability. Just eliminating consumption of fossil fuels doesn't fix the fact that we're going through the 6th mass extinction or the deforestation of the Amazon or the loss of farmable land or massive human rights abuses bc capitalism does not care about what doesn't maximize profits	UCq2GxMv3qhjdBoZS6Tqs3eg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq2GxMv3qhjdBoZS6Tqs3eg	1	UgxEWFATqL2CChX2SaF4AaABAg	Alonso S√°nchez Jimenez

AC is what we use in transmission lines. Otherwise your points stand. Renewable energy like solar generates DC power, which then needs to be converted to AC for transmission. Which would cause a loss of power. If you used DC for transmission you wouldn't even get 500 ft before the pole caught fire because DC generates too much heat when being pushed down a wire. Thomas Edison learned that the hard way when he discredited Nikola Tesla's AC way back when.

But the US currently spends more than something like the next dozen countries _combined._ They're spending over 3 times as much as their nearest competitor (China.) Slashing the US military budget by 30% would still leave them _far and away_ ahead of anyone else in the world. They'd still beat out the big three "enemies" combined (China, Russia, Iran.) Slashing it by 50% would still leave them on par with the combined total of those three countries. And most of that money is just wasted on maintaining bases the US hasn't actually occupied for decades, buying equipment they don't need just so that they can give a contract to their buddy at Lockheed-Martin or Northrop-Grumman or Halliburton. Apparently (at least according to Trump) the only thing the US military doesn't spend money on is ammunition for their troops. You know, the things they're supposed to be paying for. Its funny how all the "small government!" mouth breathers have no problem jacking up the military budget year after year after year. The DoD is the epitome of government overspending and wastefulness. And that has little to do with their actual martial capabilities.

One of the things that tires me (and I suspect other nuclear grads) is repeatedly trying to explain to people why climate change isn't an A Vs. B issue, sadly the international debate has got bogged down on one type of technology and this is making the debate very toxic and dangerously increasingly off-putting. It's time we all except people have differences and resolve the bigger issues of the day.

Logically there is no reason not to use both. Also while it is a sort of a tangent before anyone asks the "nuclear waste" is itself a source of power with investment since it can be used to make radiogenic batteries.

Nuclear plants take too long to build so renewables have to be the main expansion to buy time to build Nuclear Power plants where they're needed for the added system stability. So a lot of renewables now and built nuclear where the network will need it, along with the Internet of Things to optimize energy management.

There's no reason to view it as a fight between these. 2 - Nuclear power is also a fossil fuel. If you transition a majority of electricity production to nuclear power, you will hit peak extraction of uranium in about 15-20 years. It's important now, but long term it will need to be replaced.

I have lived in a city run by hydro-power and have compared it to a city run by coal. The electric bill is actually cheaper. The only time renewable power sources are not viable is in areas of high population density. In that case, those cities should consider using nuclear power plants.

However, I'd like to say that, if you want to know what you can do about all that situation, the first step is to change how you act. Basically, that means changing some habits, like going everywhere by car (if you have one) or using heaters fueled by fossil fuels. Then, the second step is making "good" political choices. If you are really worried about global warming, just pick a politician that leans more towards the "green agenda". If most of the population start doing those simple things (at least to some degree), the situation will probably change. And change way faster than doing nothing.

Do you think that your audience, a group of people on a single youtube thread, can provide you with a legislative policy good enough to be adopted by the US for this issue? Do you think that if nobody can answer you here, in this miniscule splinter of people, that professionals tasked by a federal government won't have an answer for you? Surely you'd agree that even if we didn't have a perfect solution available, taking action now and pooling our resources to tackle these problems will be better than rendering the planet far less habitable for, conceivably, the remainder of humanity. And if you do agree we should take action, and are just genuinely curious, take your curiosity and learn what the experts are saying, not youtube commenters. You're asking a good question, but you're not being productive.	UCGGHbtahjXaUnnXBkc0fziA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGGHbtahjXaUnnXBkc0fziA	1	UgxouIv6PC3WRRpT9-l4AaABAg	Jamie Lipper

Are you saying our 21 trillion dollar economy can't solve a $3bn problem? California wildfires in 2018 cost $400bn. Both presidential candidates, combined, may approach $2bn spent on campaign related expenses. I don't think the coal miners' salaries are the problem...

Now there is blue collar job's, but that would also take quite a chunk of money to retrain them to those job's. However yes I do agree with, a change needs to happen.

Getting uranium 235 is a pain, specifically extracting from earth and enriching it. It's a lot of work and energy and can't be used continuously. You gotta let reactors cool and nuclear waste is a huge issue. What you're proposing would require us to build THOUSANDS of nuclear power plants faster than ever before. Do I need to point out how that could be dangerous? All of these power plants will need to have a supply of uranium purified/extracted and enriched on scales that are not feasible. It is clear that people who think that scientists have just forgotten about nuclear don't understand the situation. If the only downside to nuclear power that you name is "it might blow up" then you don't understand that it isn't scalable.

But wind and solar are waiting for a magical battery to show up to make them scalable solutions and I'm critical that the technology necessary to make wind and solar a primary source in the grid will be here in our life time. Nuclear is the only carbon free base load power we have. Nuclear does have its weakness tho, like ramping up and down with demand. That's where I see the future of renewables.

A lot of Americans live on a tight budget and that makes the renewable energy improvements out of reach. The more we make renewable energy more economical, the more Americans will take the initiative to switch. Where I live solar panels are going up all the time and I know people who need a new roof and a solar roof has been an active interest.

Even small-medium sized towns (for example Erie, PA or Roanoke, VA) should have a viable public transit system to allow for people to get around without a car. They are also small enough to get anywhere by bike in under 30 mins. We spend massive amounts of money building, maintaining and expanding highways in this country, and only a tiny fraction of that cost is paid for by gas taxes and vehicle registrations. Diverting that money into public transit would make so much more possible. Another option, for people that insist on needing a private weather proof vehicle, should be neighborhood electric vehicles (NEVs). Basically a tiny EV that can only go 25mph. Sometimes compared to golf carts, they are very affordable and much more efficient, given the small size and low weight. 25mph is also as fast as anyone should ever need to go in an urban area. Trains and buses should be able to cover any travel between cities.	UCDPLvyHlONuHt6nbDEX3qNQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDPLvyHlONuHt6nbDEX3qNQ	1	UgzxYioc53heVtpnRsN4AaABAg	Kevin Cui

Imagine if your personal transportation was simplified so that you didn't need to own a car. Get things delivered from shops. Use an electric or hybrid bike. Have a local car club with electric cars and just pay for what you need. Without car taxes, insurance, tolls, fuel etc you would be richer. Everyone in urban areas at least should have the opportunity to consider getting into a car as a last resort.

Sure, misinformation, pride, and for some corporations that will be greed, but without addressing the issues of people like coal miners in the Rust Belt, for example, you will just alienate those who feel betrayed because no security to their livelihoods was ensured when the transition to a green economy started under Obama. Not to say, of course, that this means we shouldn&#39;t transition. It&#39;s just that I have not seen Democrats address this demographic, and I&#39;m worried this might increase the chance of Trump getting re-elected this year. (This wouldn&#39;t be the only cause necessarily, but it is a huge opportunity that the Dems seem to just have forgotten about or simply not considered) :/	UCirtcut2_oWfch-eOHnwUAw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCirtcut2_oWfch-eOHnwUAw	0

America is at its best when there's a material building task, and the goal is worth any cost. Both sets of my grandparents were the WWII generation, one was a Soldier/Nurse couple and the other was a Soldier/Spanish Civil War Survivor. One family was rich and one was not, but they both supported 6+ children and lived with a degree of dignity that none of the following generations have. It comes from knowing you did exactly what the country needed exactly when the moment called for it. My grandpa's age is still wrong in Navy records--he lied about it so he could join a year early.

However, think about where that energy in the cities comes from. Fuel and thus energy is a finite resource. Burning fuel doesn't create energy, rather it releases it from the intramolecular bonds between molecules that are broken when liquid fuel transitions to a gas. Therefore it follows that, in burning fuel, we are simply moving energy around in the "system" of the earth. The problem then arises when we introduce extra energy into said system, by trapping the suns light. Burning fuel is certainly a problem but it is erroneous to say that it is because it produces heat, the greenhouse effect is a much bigger problem. I'd recommend watching Dr. Simon Clark, he's a climate expert and is far more entertaining and informed than I am on the subject.

What if a bigger factor in climate change is actually the fact that heat escapes out building when we heat then? This is also a factor with cooling. So instead of the gas heating the earth, it may be the actual heat we produce adding up.

You‚Äôre absolutely right that the average American lacks the means to decarbonize on a personal basis. That‚Äôs exactly why we need policies and practices that will scale up clean energy sources on an industrial level, making them affordable for the masses (e.g., ending fossil fuel subsidies and providing economic incentives for renewables). So in that sense, it really is a matter of political will; clean technology is available, but we need to allocate our collective resources in a way that actually utilizes it.

But I want you to know we can do this. This history isn't written yet and lots is possible. Most climate activists really believe we can do this, it'll just take everyone's talents and hard work. If this is something giving you bad anxiety I heartily suggest getting into activism. It can give you some control and you're actually being part of the solution. It sounds hard but it's a lot simpler than it sounds and there's definitely something in it you'll enjoy. I hope this helped you!

Total recovery time for energy sunk into wind turbine manufacturing and installation is 5-8 months with a lifespan of 20 years (Comparative life cycle assessment of 2.0 MW wind turbines; Karl R. Haapala; Preedanood Prempreeda). For PV installations it is 1-2 years, with a 30 year lifespan (How Long Does it Take for Photovoltaics To Produce the Energy Used?; V Fthenakis). Renewables have seen huge improvements even since these sources were published.

It‚Äôs pointless to blame others because they are a bigger problem when we ourselves are also a big contributor to this multiple source problem. The US is responsible for ~13% annual emissions and the EU is responsible for ~10% while having a bigger population. Of course the US has a bigger rate/inhabitant. But my point is that regardless of how bad the US is doing we are also responsible for 10% of the problem. You should also keep in mind that higher population typically corresponds to lower emissions per person so the EU is at slight advantage if you ably take into account emissions per person	UC6B-rjO925l4YFgfVo2PdWQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6B-rjO925l4YFgfVo2PdWQ	1	UgxTsanuNTeGBOXIqyF4AaABAg	Keith Walker

Yes, I agree they don't contribute much greenhouse gas emissions NOW, but as they become more developed, they will have to use more fossil fuels in order to industrialize their economy and may eventually become as big emitters as the more industrialized countries. So essentially, we'd have to restrict them from becoming more wealthy by not allowing them to use fossil fuels (which i do not agree is possible or moral). I believe that the best way to avoid natural disasters is by having developed infrastructures rather than expecting the entire world to revolutionize their entire energy sector. I do believe that we should keep trying to move to more sustainable energy, but that we also need to consider other aspects of what that means as well and what's truly going to save more life.

Climate related deaths have reduced 98% in the last 100 years (EM-DAT). The projections of temperature and sea level rise are being highly exaggerated by the media and politicians, anyone willing to actually read the IPCCs reports will come to the same conclusion. Adaptation is a much more feasible solution then transformation.	UCUcyFTT0QJjV7I2vAP0F37A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUcyFTT0QJjV7I2vAP0F37A	1	UgxeCSjSua2dtFnLwDZ4AaABAg	Eloisa Baez Jones

And I think it is absolutely the moral thing to do to stop the world from trying to warm 1 more degree. People in the global south, which are largely developing countries, will be disproportionately affected by this warming even though they have contributed the least to climate change. The overconsumption and greenhouse gas emissions of wealthy countries will hurt people in developing more. I personally also think we should share any technology or advancements we make globally as we are all in this fight together but I do not think it's necessary to force developing countries to change anything about their current systems at this time as wealthy countries have the biggest impact.

So the question is, is it moral for developed countries to halt the growth of developing countries so that we can maybe reduce the increase in temperature by < 1 C ? My current opinion is that technology advancements have made us safer and safer each year from the natural effects of the climate. Thats why when a hurricane hits the US its relatively easy to fix the damages compared to if one hits a place like Haiti. Point being, i think investing in technologies that shield us from the effects of climate change and also help bring people out of poverty will save more lives than reducing the increase of global temperatures.

Nuclear plants and coal/gas plants operate the exact same way. How the heat is produced is the only difference. It's not that we can't store power in batteries, it's that we don't have the technology yet. Tesla is investing tons of money into this area currently, and we're making good headway, but we just aren't there yet. Just the scale of electricity that you would need to store, and then release on demand, on a grid sized level is massive. Having a battery that won't wear out under these conditions is going to require a lot of clever engineering and some new technologies or applications of materials that haven't been discovered yet. Take your cell phone for example. How long does your cell phone battery last you before it quits holding a charge? It wears out due to constant charging/discharging of the battery (as well as other factors like temperature, etc.). That battery holds such a miniscule amount of energy compared to what we would need for the power grid, but no matter the battery size, all batteries have this problem currently. I am hopeful that battery / electrical storage technology makes some big improvements in the near future. If we can solve this problem, I guarantee you every company in the world will be jumping ship to renewable energy	UCzhgrNorjKVULgX-_-syPdg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzhgrNorjKVULgX-_-syPdg	1	UgxeCSjSua2dtFnLwDZ4AaABAg	Eloisa Baez Jones

We do not have the technology to properly store power in batteries or some other form when generating it. The crux of the energy industry is that you MUST use electricity when it's generated. You cannot generate electricity at a cheaper time (say the middle of the night in the US), then use it later when everyone needs it. We are working on making this possible, but we are not even close to having a grid level solution to this problem yet. California is a great example. California switched to a lot of renewable energy (solar and wind). When the wind isn't blowing on extremely hot days, and at night, California resorts to buying power from states that use fossil fuels, due to renewable energy not being consistent in generation. We need to get there, but we don't have the technology to support it yet.

It doesn't need solar cells that are more efficient than physics tells us they can possibly be either. Solar PV and a global grid is an inexpensive all in one solution that could be deployed in a time frame where it could do some good. Investment in the same order of magnitude as current fossil fuel subsidies would pay for it in a few years. 5 trillion would cover the global grid. The next 5 trillion would install about 20 TW of PV. Do that for 5 years and you've got 100 TW of PV. So 6 years of the current subsidies would pay for the whole transition in terms of energy supply and provide free energy at the point it enters the local grid.

And improve on what we already know. Solar cells in the 80 compared to today is a whole step further on efficiency. Nuclear fusion is at least by the most optimist estimate about 5 decades until it becomes practical. There is a cons on each options and we need to strike a good balance to get our power grid up	UCs8KslNLW35voDaYnGagO6A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs8KslNLW35voDaYnGagO6A	1	UgwPTBUvwZSkrla5cdR4AaABAg	Alexandre Leclerc

Like mass manufacturing and technology improvements may make nuclear competitive with renewables. Well firstly, the steam turbines used in nuclear and coal power plants are basically the same. It's a mature tech and no real improvement can be expected there. They're already close to the theoretical maximum. That leaves the heating section. Coal is already twice the cost of renewables. For nuclear to be competitive it would have to be much much cheaper to build a nuclear reactor than a coal fire. I think you must agree that's completely ridiculous. It's never going to be cheaper to build a reactor than a big box that you dump coal into. You mention the unreliable nature of renewables, but I think you mean intermittent nature. Renewables are much more reliable. The estimate i gave for nuclear assumes a global grid to maximise the efficient use of the nuclear output. If nuclear is only connected locally, most of its output is wasted as it must be sized for peak demand. I only calculated costs based on average demand. Without a global grid, you'd need about 12000 reactors rather than 4000. (360 trillion dollars and fuel exhausted in under 5 years). Obviously a global grid must be a part of any solution. Of course the same global grid makes the issue of intermittent supply from renewables go away. It's always sunny somewhere and it's always windy somewhere. No need for storage. No need for additional dams.	UCaXdo8msuwPLzRsdE60YnwA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaXdo8msuwPLzRsdE60YnwA	1	UgwPTBUvwZSkrla5cdR4AaABAg	Alexandre Leclerc

Thus leaves with the most championed source the renewables, which has its own cost and disadvantages, dams are ecologically dangerous and costly to built as well, renewables are not as green or beautiful as we want them to be. And there are risks on using them just a different one compared to burning co2 and monoxides to the atmosphere	UCs8KslNLW35voDaYnGagO6A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs8KslNLW35voDaYnGagO6A	1	UgwPTBUvwZSkrla5cdR4AaABAg	Alexandre Leclerc

A cost no object government project. After 80 years of research, the commercial reactor, which went out to a competitive bidding process, Hinkley Point C, is projected to cost 28.5 billion USD. Some things cost what they cost. I don't think a crash program is going to lower costs. Fast, Cheap, Safe. More of one, less of the others. We need to build thousands of reactors, and we need them to be running in a decade or less. So fast isn't negotiable. It has to be fast. That means an existing design, for existing costs. We probably need in the order of 4000 additional reactors. That's about 120 trillion dollars. That's about the entire global economy for 2 years. All nuclear is, is a con by the fossil fuel industry designed to delay the build out of renewables. 2 minutes with Google and a calculator and it's obviously never going to be of any use. I'm a huge fan of nuclear. I think it's incredible tech. Like formula one. But it makes exactly as much sense for global energy as it would to replace public transport with formula one cars.

At about 10 times the cost of renewables, it's going to be expensive. B) we had unlimited time. Wind and solar takes about 1/10th to 1/20th of the construction time. C) we had unlimited uranium. The world nuclear association who exist to promote nuclear say "the current world‚Äôs power reactors, with combined capacity of about 400 GWe, require some 67,500 tonnes of uranium from mines or elsewhere each year." They also say world reserves of uranium are about 6,142,600 tonnes. So that's 91 years at current usage. (they say that themselves) That provides 400 GW of electricity according to the association. That's 3500 TWh power year. Current electricity consumption world wide is about 22000 TWh so if all electricity came from nuclear, current reserves would be exhausted in 15 years. But we're taking about replacing all energy, not just electricity. So under 15 years. (before you say "seawater" look up how much U there is in a cubic metre of sea water, then figure out how much energy it takes to pump a cubic metre of seawater say 10 metres up into a separation plant. Uranium from seawater is completely ridiculous) So apart from those issues, nuclear is great! I'm all for it.

Not because of range or charging issues, but because we don't have enough lithium in the world to do it. We need a dramatic, revolutionary shift in battery technology OR we could simply try driving less. And driving less would have any other benefits for society, and would be cheaper for everyone. We should all walk, bike and take public transit more. Metros/subways can run on electricity, but they dont need a battery. Trolleybuses can run on electricity without a battery. Or we should try to replace as much driving "around town" with low speed electric vehicles (25mph street legal golf carts, basically). The batteries are much smaller, but the range is still enough to go do a day's errands.

UgwDJtLsfunN3SZrvAV4AaABAg.9DTPNfGwWIM9DdLFmFhWCX		5	2020-09-15 19:41:21	Julie M	after 4 years as an environmental science undergrad, now a couple months into my masters, nothing is more depressing than climate change professors who had kids in ~2010-2015 thinking things would get better by now. I'm glad that my growing up happened to align well with this moment. I have the luxury of being able to wait until the late 2020s-early 2030s until I really have to decide on that one, and by then we'll know if there's any point. It's heartbreaking to watch old-guard climate scientists talk about their children. They almost never do. They rarely seem joyful about their kids, and what joy they have is tinged with a deep-seated angst about the future. If things are still bad by the 30s I'm planning to adopt from somewhere of high-impact like the US Gulf Coast or SE Asia, where at least I can tell my kid "You and I might not have chosen to alive at this moment in history, but we're both on this world together, and I'm working on it, and I'm going to give you the best life you can have." Then you avoid the baggage of having caused someone to exist at this time, while still sharing the world with a young person and passing on your love and knowledge. In the same way that you and I might lose our desire to have biological children because of the real dangers of climate change, there are children who are going to be displaced or whose parents won't be able to care for them because of it. There needs to be someone raising the next generation of environmentalists. Young people like us and our descendants will be working on this for the lifetime of carbon emissions: ten thousand years.

Imagine if all countries focused to have 100% green electricity and heating. Airplanes, a few cars etc could be future goals. Break it into realistic, achievable parts and do those achievable parts asap instead of delaying and focusing on the parts we can&#39;t yet achieve.

It can run on a natural gas power plant in the intern but also be powered by renewable resources in the future. A natural gas furnace has no option to be run on anything but natural gas directly. One day we will have to replace all of these so why not start now? So if the day were to come that we could harness renewable energy at scale, all the infrastructure would already be in place by providing gov. incentives to do so NOW, not when that energy is ready to be used. (this is a side tangent about furnaces but the same theory has to be applied to other aspects of life) I understand the current limitations of these renewable sources but i don't think you comprehend the exponential curve that R&D in these fields can yield. That is the point of "the green new deal". To ween us into a new era and help us develop these systems. Don't be naive to think that the way we do things now has to be the way we do it in the future in terms of manufacturing, mining, material science etc but that can not be determined until we dedicate endless resources to it. We have invented materials and machines before that revolutionized industries and I still believe in american innovation and think we can do it again.

Just like you can power an electric car with power generated by coal. You realize all this green infrastructure makes us use natural gas inefficiently because you need gas for days that solar and wind don't meet the demand and these resources you need to fight climate change don't come out of thin are. They consume a wide variety of rare minerals for turbines, panels, and batteries some of which we don't have a supply to make these plans feasible. The consequences to the environment are tremendous from the mining and manufacturing needed for all this "green" infastructure that will need to constantly be replaced. The problem on this planet isn't the carbon it's the infestation of humans.	UC8B3NsT17FFEXQn841vDnhw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8B3NsT17FFEXQn841vDnhw	1	Ugzvn7RgIacYOd2rIQh4AaABAg	Scott Tulpin

Any step towards a solution is better than talking about it. Electric furnaces can run on the proposed renewable energy sources, natural gas ones cannot. Same goes for other machines. If we are already making these things, lets at least make them all run on electric motors so that if the day comes when we have renewable energy sources we don't have to back track and replace all these appliances in peoples homes. I agree there are more issues than carbon emissions but we have enough resources to attack on multiple fronts and like the saying goes; you eat an elephant one bite at a time.

Literally half of it was spent explaining weening off consumer level fossil fuel consumption by continuing to use industrial level manufacturing with fossil fuels as a way to eliminate the lowest hanging fruit of carbon emissions. From there we would address the large scale industrial emissions which simultaneously would benefit from in advanced in technology during the first step.

It's an interconnected world, countries like China rely on trade, sanctions and other punishments like this have worked in the past. Hit their money, the oligarchs will force the government to agree. We're already seeing it though, even China has agreed to decarbonize. Likely because they know fossil fuels aren't the future, renewables are. Something like 20-30% of vehicles in China are electric. The less they have to rely on oil, the better position they'll be, so electric is a great solution. Now if only US politicians would stop accepting millions from oil companies long enough to admit the future is electric...

Solar and wind efficiency is directly affected by where you are, and their energy output varies a lot during the day (day/night cycle) and the year (seasons). You cant run a grid only on them. Hydro and geothermal you need to specific conditions to be met, and specially hydro is not nearly as safe as you think. It is also not so clean (here in Brazil we use it a lot, but comes at a price of huge forested areas getting flooded to make the resevoir. It also damages the fauna) The new generation nuclear reactors are indeed the safest, most reliable and stable power source that there is. And you can build those almost anywhere you like	UC0KysxAfujXQ7BRMgV84tHA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0KysxAfujXQ7BRMgV84tHA	1	UgyBauW6HevU9z3Jpz54AaABAg	Yanir Ohana

And that is with just the first 10 to 100 years of nuclear waste handling included in the price. Include millions of years of waste handling and even electricity from human powered treadmills would be cheaper. It is also not sustainable since we have already run out of high-concentration Uranium sources.

According to geologists and paleontologists, climate change has been happening cyclically ad infinitum since the dawn of creation. The Earth has gone through multiple cycles of warming and cooling over the past millennia and will continue to do so until the sun burns out. The current climate change rhetoric being pushed by politicians is mostly alarmist hype about something that was going to happen with or without humans. Human use of fossil fuels is a contributing factor but it is not the cause.	UCbp_5DZdj1Bd2Suojqd0D4A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbp_5DZdj1Bd2Suojqd0D4A	1	UgwoMKURDj8z14t5bSF4AaABAg	Wall Froster

Cutting out transportation energy consumption. And we want to force law makers to put it into law sensitizing manufacturer to build these news machines in bulk. But you know, as a consumer, nothings stop you and your friends of going out with a bike(except maybe a lot of unsafe roads, but ya). Heck, doing a bit of entrepreneurship and making the next Uber Bus/Train? I think the solution to the video was a bit simplistic and nature and focused too much on how to change the source? instead of looking what can be cut reduced or changed in the use graph in part #3. I&#39;m all for green energy, but cutting out natural gas, fossil fuel, and petroleum for clean energy and electricity in 1 fell sweep is impossible in a 5,10,20 year period. It&#39;s much more realistic to tackle the problem by both end and cut out the bad energy source progressively.	UCFu9U3XWv1x6OC18NLQNHeA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFu9U3XWv1x6OC18NLQNHeA	0

You know what really would help against global warming? Technology. As it stands, solar, wind, and such are not very efficient. They are very costly and don't produce as much energy as you would think. It would take *600 windmills to replace 1 coal plant.* We need to get green energy as close to fossil fuels in terms of efficiency and costs.

The US, with currently one of the most carbon emissions per capita and highest cumulative historical emissions, is a key country for driving the resolution of carbon emissions.

Take the example of Germany spending billions on renewable emissions skyrocketed and utility cost went up. Plus solar requires 16x more material 450x more land than Nuclear also it's produces about 300x more waste something known as e-waste in the process highly toxic stuff, produces more emissions creating them than nuclear and even deaths. Not to mention the rare minerals that require to be used to build it that still needs facking and mining to extract them. Wind kills 1.2 million insects per year in germany not to mention birds, bats many that are highly endangered or close to extinction at least here in California.

Here in Europe there's plenty of pledges to move to net zero (which will require a lot of sequestration as it's near impossible for us to emit no CO2 at all) but plans are often a bit shaky at best, every so often someone comes up with one and it gets picked apart until someone else comes up with another. Technology is changing rapidly in this area due to many billions in R&D investment. As such it's hard to forecast an optimal path to net zero, or what hard choices would have to be made to lifestyles and standards of living.

Also lets use common sense solar and wind does use more land and comes indirect contact with the environment.The IRENA estimated that at the end of 2016, there were around 250,000 metric tonnes of solar panel waste globally. The solar panels contain lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd) and many other harmful chemicals that could not be removed if the entire panel is cracked Let me ask you this why are you so against nuclear power? just wondering.

UgxZaWyxgNweUMJ_CTV4AaABAg	0	0	2020-10-02 05:57:26	007sephiroth1	Vox and viewers, I have a plea to all of you. It is my fervent belief and wish that nuclear energy will become the primary utility for electricity generation and consumption. I want all to consider not so much the ecological impact, but the economic model and innovative technological advancement potential through its usage. I want people to focus less on the emotional plays of saving the world climate, which has not been agreed upon by data and statistical modeling, but the economic boons that using nuclear energy would bring. Consider what it would mean for the USA if we not only produced enough electricity for our own country, but produced so much we would sell it to all of North America and South American continental nations. Consider for a moment the monumental shift in technologies when we produce automobiles fully electric and autonomous. Consider all the millions of jobs that could be created in manufacturing for building nuclear power facilities, using coal as a medium for the creation of synthetic diamonds and tools using those diamonds, using petroleum for the advancement of polymers for a variety of utilities such as improved ballistic protection, improved shielding for spacecraft, etc. Consider the rise of all these products in our markets and how much cheaper some of these technologies would become through the acceleration of all these fields of research and development! We could be on a path to a completely new level of manufacturing, production, energy profile consumption, and technological breakthroughs, if only we stopped fearing nuclear energy and harness its true power! We have so much to look forward to in these regards! Stop pushing the fear based narratives that I, as well as so many other conservative, libertarian, and independently minded people are so sick of. Start recognizing the profound impact that nuclear energy can and should have in our world if we but acknowledge it.<br /><br />I beg you environmentalists, progressives, democrats, and all others who find yourselves frustrated at our seemingly callousness toward the climate change narrative, PLEASE recognize the common ground we can have on all these things. Focus on the positives, and simply mention side benefits in the risks we avoid as a result. Let&#39;s move toward the future together.<br /><br />By the way, I am a Trump supporter. I am one of those who so disagree with the climate change narrative. Yet in the same breath I also will tell you it is my life dream and goal to push nuclear energy forward and therefore unleash our countries passions once again for new innovation in electrical applications and space exploration. We can do this.	UC7y7BmQy-ZUZwDnA79LBnYw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7y7BmQy-ZUZwDnA79LBnYw	0

There is also range anxiety in more rural areas and a high dependence on diesel cars and long commutes because of high rents in our cities. Bike and walking infrastructure is shambolically bad and poorly maintained, we are only at the starting blocks compared to our European neighbours. Encouraging starts are being made in working from home and reducing commutes due to the c19 crisis. The effects of this change may carry over into continuing working from home for climate reasons even if the c19 crisis is eventually solved. Big difficulties are mass flying and mass distribution of heavy goods by truck and ship, hard to see these being electrified.

I think that's the bigger challenge than changing existing machines to work on electricity instead of fossil fuels (which you see we have already done). In that sense I get hopeful that green elctricity is starting to get cheaper than coal and gas. I hope technology will keep developing at this pace so in ten years or so, the transition will be easier.

UgxVJ7n1zIarwCDjfuF4AaABAg.9DRVmnyoSXR9DUmYK53xqO		1	2020-09-12 02:36:09	Brian	I mean this video while one of the better videos I‚Äôve seen on the subject, simplifies the problems at an astronomical level. Energy alone is one of the most complicated industries on earth, and how you manipulate the sources that you use can have considerable impacts on other industries. For example solar and wind while effective in the sense that they are relatively easy to construct and are relatively cheap in generative capital, as you increase their concentration in the market you grow demand for supplemental grid infrastructure at an extremely rapid rate due to the intermittency of these sources. If you can‚Äôt manufacture these additional grid technologies fast enough then you may cause catastrophic problems. However on the flip side if you keep using energy sources with primarily baseload supply then you can encounter significant negative supply waste or unutilized base sources which operate at losses throughout the year. As much as viewers may like a simple cookie cutter solution - that‚Äôs not in reality. We need to develop a plan with input from scientists and engineers that recognize the complexity and scale of the problems presented for decarbonization and we also need the media to be able to explain these complexities to the general public so that they can encourage our political leaders to agree to a plan produced by science to reduce the impacts of climate change.

Why do you think it took this long to get going, well thats because the left use it as a platform to get votes, so my belief is when the left goes, green energy takes off.

Most of the clean energy sources are free, in the sense that the sun, the wind and the seas/rivers won't send us bills to use their ressources, unlike oil and coal companies. You also don't run into the problem of these ressources becoming increasingly rare and increasingly expensive. So while they are a big initial investment, I would argue that the farther in time you go, the *longer* the term, the more they will have paid for themselves (over the oil/coal alternative).

Solar and wind only generate energy when the sun is shining or the wind is blowing when we need energy all the time regardless of the weather and battery technology is no were near good enough to do anything about that. Nuclear fusion is always 30 years away and Nuclear fission derived energy worldwide poses the risk of nuclear weapons ploriferation and it already has too bad of a reputation for people to accept a nuclear power plant on their doorsteps. As for renewable energy tech advancements i hope it goes well but it just isnt good enough yet but i would of course commend investment in it. I am not saying we have to stick with fossil fuels but i am saying we shouldnt paint the issue as a simple one were everything is ready and we just need to press a button and everything is going to be ok. Finally, with regards to your last statement ill just say this; i believe there is no future were humans dont destroy earth. Even if we were to go renewable we would be destroying forests and replacing them with solar panels or something else. I would like that to not be the case but i am a realist and thats just the way it is. Nothing in this universe is eternal. The world will come to an end one day.

UgzRKEPfLxs_hBQ_Mop4AaABAg.9E0sEfY9EJv9E64PeiSXT1		0	2020-09-27 08:51:22	Comrade of the Balance	a y The dominance can be explained contextually. Chemical energy is the easiest form of energy we can obtained. But as we have learnt, it costs the environment, the health of the people and that it is difficult to replicate (non-renewable). The most viable will be anything that can be obtained with what nature already gives us. Sunlight, fission and fusion power, the waves, wind etc. These are attainable and we do not need to change or add ongoing long term effects. Sure they still have problems but in the long term, they are just economically viable because they are permanent and long lasting. Now a personal question, do you not read the incredible advances of renewable technology enough to convince you they can be more efficient and viable as long as we encourage innovation and implementation? And a somewhat objective statement: Our Planet will face catastrophic changes at 2050 but we had hopes by 2030 we could have moved away from using fossil fuel. If we do not do hard and quick implementation, it will be too late. And many will still live long enough to see the temperature charts and regions change significantly. Thus there should be no reason for delay unless incompetence is leading the blockade.	UCbIobR4zOpIBNbYOqPDb_OA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbIobR4zOpIBNbYOqPDb_OA	1	UgzRKEPfLxs_hBQ_Mop4AaABAg	a y

And even if you could replace all current energy consumption with renewables there would still be a massive increase in electricity usage. The total amount of needed energy only goes up when switching to electricity and so far we only have ONE source of electricity capable of delivering this extra demand and that&#39;s nuclear. So taking into account that the construction of a nuclear power plant takes around 10 years ... well good luck with the wildfires I&#39;d say	UCseWsSxbs5vZaTlJI4Ar5XA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCseWsSxbs5vZaTlJI4Ar5XA	0

Zero emission air travel doesn&#39;t need to be postponed to battery perfection. Steel can be made without any fossil fuel and a lot less energy (Mitsubishi microwave technology and H2 reduction process) although a lot of usages for steel can also be substituted by carbon fiber which in large scale would be comparable in price and can be made fossil fuel free as well. Concrete has much less carbon intensive alternatives such geopolymer, however the use of steel and concrete for construction can also be replaced with other alternatives such as wood and carbon fiber.

Biomass for the longest time has actually mostly been trees that have been cut down and while trees do replenish themselves it takes more than one year for a tree to grow to the height it would need to be to be cut down. The documentary Planet of the Humans shows that the solutions that are being touted are not ones which are sustainable we need to change how we live and how many children we have.

All of that decarbonization infrastructure will still rely, in part, on climate-damaging resource extraction and industrial processes which can be minimized by also using less energy to begin with. For example, it&#39;s far better to eliminate vehicle trips or cut down on the total number of vehicles produced than just switching to a decarbonized electric energy source because of the fossil fuel energy involved in the manufacture process.

The existing nuclear plants will have to do some heavy lifting in the transition to a low carbon future. Hydro can act as a battery if you use surplus renewable energy to pump water back up to the reservoir. There isn't time to build a lot of nuclear plants and the world wide supply of uranium is also limited. Everyone will have to live a simpler, better life and the govt needs to facilitate this.

We all have the power to make a difference right now and in every single moment. We all can and must reduce our consumption now. We use far more than we need and are beyond wasteful. We can grow our own food or at least support local farmers, since industrial agriculture and transporting food uses so much energy and is destructive. We have to work to heal the soil and plant trees. We certainly must stop destroying forests and other natural places. We need to learn the appropriate use of technology. Yes, other changes are needed too, but we can&#39;t ignore the fact that our habits must change, not just how &quot;green&quot; our technology is. We have to step up and be leaders, not rely solely on politicians to do it for us.	UCosrJOh0JsRPnpFrY7lVI6Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCosrJOh0JsRPnpFrY7lVI6Q	0

Right now, solar and wind power are terribly inefficient, and most people don&#39;t realize that the closest thing that we have to electric semi-trucks are Elon Musk&#39;s proposed models which according to Carnegie Mellon&#39;s researchers would have a 300 mile range (which is bad), limited cargo capacity, and the batteries alone would cost around 2-3 times more than a diesel rig.<br /><br />Also, I&#39;d just like to point out that the Paris Climate Agreement allowed each country to create their own goals that wouldn&#39;t even necessarily be met. The problem with that is some countries made more ambitious goals than others. For instance, the US&#39;s goal was to reduce emissions by 26-28% by 2025, whereas China, who is arguably equally responsible for climate change as the US, submitted a goal that said reach peak emissions by 2030. Not a very ambitious goal coming from the supposed &quot;world leaders in green energy&quot; right now <br /><br />personally i&#39;m a fan of Terrapower&#39;s travelling wave reactors and other nuclear power	UCR5AY_wbW962QjmLuPE-Sig	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR5AY_wbW962QjmLuPE-Sig	0

In the earth's orbit, there already is a lot of waste (eg. broken satellites). If you want to dispose of your waste, you would have to come up with a lot of energy to send it into orbit and even more to send it out of earths gravitational reach...

If you say: A) we should consume wayy less energy and do not drive cars in the first place, then YES, (additional) solar panels and EVs are not that good of a solution. But if you say: B) We want to be able to consume at least about the levels we do now and still be able to drive cars, then NO, additional Solar panels and EVs (as a substitution for yet-to-sell-ICE-cars) are not bad in the long term. Depending on the placement, solar panels produce the energy they needed to be manufactured, transported, installed, maintained, deconstructed and recycled within 3,5 years in the worst cases down to under a year in good cases, while having a life expectancy of about 25 years. If an EV is used properly ( -> not thrown away after 40000 km) it also consumes way less energy than an ICE car. But, as mentioned befor, concerning cars the actual question has to be: do we really need that many cars?

Also America might be the olderest country to keep using Fossil fuels but it is short sighted to think that doing something about America will solve a global problem. Key word global, every country needs change and I don&#39;t know if everyone can comprehend the degree of change needed for that.

It's the same in the building end of the equation. If you let plants live to the end of their projected life (80 years) and you value the energy they produce, they'll have fully funded decommissioning funds. To do that, you need to address natural gas pricing since the gas glut is what is driving nuclear plants offline. Not renewables.

Being an european, I still fear for Trumps re-election, in part because of the climate actions. In 2018 the US accounted for 13.9% of CO2 emissions (2nd after China) but only accounts for 4% of earths population. Being one of the richest nations and one of the biggest economies on earth, this situation is quite irritating....

Not even if you count the EU as a single entity. Still almost twice the size of China. USA: 20.5 T, EU: 18.3 T, China: 13.6T. I think the Vox writer was confused about GDP on purchasing power parity level, in which case China is considered larger because you can get more for your money there.

However, when we think of it in terms of consumption, this seems like a total bailout for people who consume the most. If the government is going to buyback someone&#39;s Lexus LX (coincidentally a very expensive vehicle) as it is one of the highest emitters of CO2, then that money could not have bought 5 to 10 solar arrays.

People usually get emotional about Global warning but the problem is way more sophisticated. Coal and natural gas is so much versatile and economical to use. That‚Äôs why people use it. Private sector needs to step up and make green energy more economical. I don‚Äôt think writing an executive order will solve the economics of the situation. Carbon tax is a band aid for a broken leg!

The good thing that Tesla are doing however is extensive research and development in batteries and electric specific technologies to then reduce the price of entry for people to join in on a global shift to an electric economy. (when I say 'electric economy', I mean global infrastructure that is based around using electricity rather than gas or oil) Tesla's are expensive, but they are the catalyst for driving change.

They&#39;re so expensive and very new that the average person either can&#39;t afford them or don&#39;t want/trust them/know anything about them. This especially goes for younger people like myself who can only afford an old car. Good luck with converting America to electric cars in any time span less than 50 years. As well, our public transportation is abysmal in this country so it&#39;s not like you could convince people to take the bus.

The biggest thing people miss when it comes to electric over gas is that a large chunk of our electricity is made from coal and gas. <b>Statistically</b> electricity is cleaner, but depending on where you live an electric car might just be an indirect way of burning fossil fuels.

The problem that remains, particularly with electric cars and windfarms, is the fossil fuel and resource cost it takes to construct them. Modern windfarms require many tonnes of steel, concrete and rare earth metals and they are difficult to recycle. Similar issues with electric cars. An system based on these technologies should really be called &#39;Fossil Fuel+&#39; rather than truly renewable.

As the Alabama born biologist Stephen Jay Gould said &quot;the median is not the message&quot; (nor the average! --- me).<br /><br />We&#39;ll go back to education here ... how to explain instability to a high school graduate (average student not honors roll)?

Ever wondered how we make batteries and other electronic devices? By literally digging craters in the landscape in order to extract precious resources. We also hire labor which is working in the same conditions as coal miners if not worse and the industrial process literally gives cancer to locals and workers. Replacing fossil energies by electricity is literally changing the place where we have to dig and pollute. there is no such thing as 100% clean economies. This is delusional. Btw China manipulates their market monopoly on these materials with negative gearing tactics, which is a problem for other countries jobs and economical success. They also use slaves to produce very famous goods you use in your everyday life. Science never made a solid consensus about what we should do on this topic for a good reason. Becoming an engineer or physics scientist is not for everyone and the solution is not simple at all. Electrical energy, okay, but how? We need finite resources to produce and manipulate it with specific tools.	UCvOfBd14RKkTp7GDP3vIHog	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvOfBd14RKkTp7GDP3vIHog	1	UgyofcbPX3PRwxq-JiZ4AaABAg	Michael Xie

However, I believe it misses a critical point on how this change will be possible in the current electric utility sector. Right now, the problem with solar and wind is there intermittency. Meaning that during a power shortfall that occurs for example when solar power plants enter night time, or a period of excessive cloud cover the power they output gets reduced. So you‚Äôll see a PP go from producing 100 MW electricity to producing 20 MW in a matter of minutes. This shortfall needs to be met by another, fast ramp rate source to ensure that there aren‚Äôt blackouts (assuming no demand response programs are in place, and customer demand remains steady). Right now the two options we have for this (as reliable and dispatch able energy) and storage tech and gas turbines. The storage tech available as batteries works well for very short term needs, but does not have the energy storage capacity needed to replace gas turbines as peaker units. If you want to know more about this, please read into the California duck curve. These industrial solar and wind projects work but cause a lot of reliability problems with the electric grid - especially if you take offline gas power plants. In short, you have to play a balancing game right now with adding renewables, retiring old fossil fuel generating stations, and maintaining reliable grid operations without blackouts. In my personal opinion, gen. IV nuclear is a good baseload alternative, but the lack of public support for nuclear power will leave us stuck with fossil fuel plants for decades if nothing changes- even with adoption of solar and wind.

Additionally by cutting fossil fuels from electricity you are reducing that output by about a 1/3. I feel like we glazed over the major issue here which isn‚Äôt converting the machines.

UgyZQ94kx2I_rswydKx4AaABAg	2	4	2020-09-10 12:03:24	Jesse Torres	I once saw this political cartoon where there was¬†a map of the United States of America. In the image,¬†all of the landlocked states were¬†in red with¬†one big word bubble that said &quot;climate change is a myth.&quot; Meanwhile,¬†all of the coastal/southern border states were blue with multiple word bubbles that said &quot;we beg to differ&quot; since those landlocked states don&#39;t experience the impacts of climate change that the coastal states do. Also, you&#39;d figure that more Conservative Evangelicals would actually care about climate change and it&#39;s impacts on society. Keep in mind, The Bible does say that the Earth is God&#39;s gift to man, and it&#39;s our duty to take care of it and everyone and everything on it. But, even if they found a way around this, you&#39;d figure that they would at least want to prevent millions of migrants from countries that are no longer habitable from wanting to come to America in the future.

UgymukkTm7AMNeVa-H54AaABAg	0	3	2020-09-14 02:50:44	Malachi Marko	A big problem with transportation is the cars factor with how expensive they are compared to old cars that run really well. People in lower wage brackets cannot afford electric cars and won&#39;t for a while and electric cars are expensive to repair and the 20-30 y/o cars are inexpensive to buy and most of the time you can easily fix a problem yourself Saving money which isn&#39;t all that possible with new gas cars let alone electric. Gas cars are going to be around for a long time unless we somehow get them cheap enough to buy and as easy to fix on your own because a lot of people such as myself don&#39;t have enough income to pay for specialist to work on my car I have enough money for me to work on my car but not to pay someone to do it with more expensive oem parts also the amount of people who love to tune their cars don&#39;t get the same amount of freedom with an electric car you can&#39;t do as much to it gas card are here to stay for a while I&#39;m convinced well after I&#39;m dead if I&#39;m wrong well I&#39;ll have the future to show me that but if we want to lower co2 we need to also recycle carbon like we&#39;ve shown we can yes it&#39;s expensive but just like solar it&#39;ll most likely go down in price a lot as more people know how to work on them and more know how they work we can&#39;t just stop producing carbon and call it good we need to take carbon in we have the technology to do so. So we should do it make companies do it it&#39;s not hard I believe you guys made a video about taking in carbon from the atmosphere. We don&#39;t need to get rid of carbon emissions all together and create a big hassle when we can fund carbon recycling yes we need to use renewable energy as much as we can but also reduce the amount of co2 that is currently in our atmosphere just getting rid of fossil fuels all together is illogical for the foreseeable future we need to have carbon recycling more mainstream and easier to access and at the same time switch to renewable energy for electricity and easily convertible transportation such as busses trains and taxis, also to be able to heat our homes and water we have small heaters it can&#39;t be hard to have large scale heaters, also there are electric hot water heaters we need to push them with an incentive and same goes for renewable electricity. Being fully decarbonized on 30 years is a dream there are factors such as wealth and people set on what they like you can&#39;t just change how much someone gets paid on a whim and you can&#39;t change how people feel about what they own since they worked for it and are familiar with it and don&#39;t need to pay someone 5x as much to work on an electric car compared to what they pay to fix their gas car themselves it&#39;s not gonna be in 2050 it&#39;s gonna be far later but we have technology to reduce the amount of carbon in our atmosphere not the amount we produce but to lower the current amount in it we just need to pair it with logical placement of renewable energy that is all thanks for reading	UCM7kDrmfzniGcoD0JeZvKAw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCM7kDrmfzniGcoD0JeZvKAw	0

Think of the batteries that will be needed to store renewable energy when it is not windy or sunny, as well as the batteries in electric vehicles. The production of these batteries are not without their own forms of pollution. Consider these batteries all require materials like lithium, cobalt and nickel, which are often extracted in poorer countries under terrible working conditions that also harm the local ecosystems. <br /><br />We should not forget to include and consider additional options. For example in the transportation sector, consider cars that use hydrogen fuel cells, or an increased focus on public transportation or even largely disbanding the frequent commuting to work altogether. As can be seen during the covid pandemic, working at home is also an option.	UCZvrgrAbcVD8qc1tk5yMz-w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZvrgrAbcVD8qc1tk5yMz-w	0

So I ask seriously: clean energy technologies will require a massive increase in toxic waste production and mining to name just a few problems with &quot;clean&quot; energy. Battery technology requires the use of toxic material, as does the production of solar cells. As this technology is scaled up to meet global energy needs, what happens to the waste caused by mining the raw materials, producing the products, and then disposing of them once their service life is up? Early generation solar panels are reaching that point and I&#39;m reading about the challenges of managing the waste properly.

We, as people, have also a big impact on the environment.<br />Our way of life have destroyed the environment and caused climate disruption. So, instead of blindly pointing fingers at the fossil fuel industry, we should think about what we as individuals can do for the environment.<br />We should stop eating meat and dairy products, they are responsible for 17% of all CO2 emissions.<br /><b>Being vegan is the single most important thing an individual can do for the environment.</b>	UCA4BLO4ZD2jUhuRcBP8nk1g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCA4BLO4ZD2jUhuRcBP8nk1g	0

There is no analysis about the overall economic effects of everyone buying electric cars, swapping out their appliances that rely on gas, and stopping to work at industrial locations that supply/manufacture this type of energy. I would like to see some evidence based argument that would alleviate the fears of everyone who simply cannot afford to do this. The reality is that the vast majority of people who are directly involved and supporting the use of fossil fuels are not physicists, they aren&#39;t engineers, and they most certainly aren&#39;t rich.

UgwA735OVnMkMGfrded4AaABAg	0	0	2020-09-16 22:06:19	Cody Craddock	The problem with many carbon taxe plans is they incentivize overconsumption in the short run. Since producers know that a higher carbon tax is coming in the future they actually over produce fossil fuels in the short run and drive the price down in the short run by seeking profits. The excess oil on the market is used for lower value purposes and causes more pollution. In the end there is usually more carbon emitted from this market intervention than would have come from no market intervention at all. <br /><br />Many economists actually propose a carbon tax that starts out high in the short run and slopes off in the future. This way, energy producers have more incentive to make the transition to clean(er) energy because of the cheaper costs associated with ‚Äúgoing green‚Äù. Put another way, an energy producer could save more money in the long run by switching now.	UCdxgZS7sM6pR57Jgb0xanhQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdxgZS7sM6pR57Jgb0xanhQ	0

Ugx_jxqk8rYze1zHk_94AaABAg	0	0	2020-09-10 21:36:33	Robert Mech	I think this is an oversimplified approach to resolving the issues of Fossil fuels. Switching everything to Electric would cost most consumers considerably more month to month. Just compare your gas bill in the winter to your AC bill in the summer. Electricity costs considerably more. Switching everything to electric would also tax the power grid more causing costs to rise even further as companies beef up the power grid to compensate. There would be some cost shifting that would offset the electric switch but this video doesn&#39;t address any of that. What about jobs in those sectors? Economic impact? While I agree and believe we need to reduce carbon emissions this oversimplified view of the solution is dangerous. With so many people in the US living in poverty, the wealth gap and now unemployed with COVID a switch like this could turn the lights out for a lot of people.

Seriously. Think about that. <br />Imagine your life right now if someone turns off your electricity. And then approach this solution with a healthy concern that such electricity is controlled in ways that are decentralised, democratic and not fiscally burdensome to people who can barely afford the costs of living as things stand now. <br />I champion progressive thinking about natural resources, but I also realise such must be done with tremendous care, else we trade one sorry situation for another.

Cause they are the only ones that can be switched on quickly in case of a drop due to unfavorable weather.<br /><br />But what seems to be often missed, is that the heat pumps intoduction on the mass scale can decrease the atmospheric temperatures directly - if used to help the AC systems (and many heat pumps can also do the cooling in summer) they can pump the heat from the atmosphere into soil. This way we would make the +2C less problematic, as this would be lowering the maximal and increasing the minimal temperatures every year, by using earth as a heat sink to store the excess heat in summer and draw from in winter.<br /><br />This is not going to make a huge impact, but it will be helping at least slightly.

It was probably implied by the graphic but I just wanted to ask for clarification.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfAXbGInwno&amp;t=7m02s">7:02</a> If we made everything electric, wouldn&#39;t the e-waste caused by all of these electronic things be still very damaging to the environment? I think one of the only ways to solve this would be to win the right to repair our electronics, and for the public to have a better understanding of them, but we aren&#39;t anywhere near that. I think we would need to tackle that issue before making everything electronic, which would be super cool don&#39;t get me wrong, but I&#39;m cautious.

The problem with Vox is they believe that the American liberal &quot;democratic&quot; system, and American neoliberal economics, are fundamentally sound. Thus, Vox portrays the solution as simply being one of public will. This perspective is so out of touch with reality, it&#39;s astounding. I have no doubt that majority of the American public would support aggressive climate mitigation policies, if given the choice. But, it&#39;s not our choice, is it. Moneyed interests have all the power, and they will choose what America does, or does not do, to combat climate change. I have no doubt those moneyed interests will do only that which is best for their personal net worth. I guess we just have to hope that what&#39;s best for the 1%&#39;s bottom line is also what&#39;s best for the climate...<br /><br />...god help us all.

It&#39;s not just about decarbonising our energy sources, we also need to actually change the way we do stuff. For example, prioritising rail transport over short haul flights, reducing the use of concrete to the bare minimum and start using wood based alternatives, etc. Great video though. That chart looks amazing.	UCCJ3nphtrYvukxeS3pFP0tA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCJ3nphtrYvukxeS3pFP0tA	0

Paired with carbon capture could this actually reduce carbon levels? <br />Further, I am curious why this video suggests de-carbonizing all sectors other than industry when industrial build up is so vital to their strategy to combating climate change for all other sectors. Why would the future de-carbonized economy be built with an antiquated carbon producing method?	UCCPWYrKYGCFFa1guBf7KtLA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCPWYrKYGCFFa1guBf7KtLA	0

It doesn&#39;t have to be an economy vs. environment situation, they can actually go hand in hand really well. As they mentioned in the video, we&#39;d need a mobilization only seen during wartime. Right there lies perhaps millions of jobs and mostly untapped industry potential that could cause a boom in our economy. Instead, other countries are surpassing us, and we&#39;re ceding the market advantage.	UCzlJa4yTNC2KHgdTU2cr3Xg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzlJa4yTNC2KHgdTU2cr3Xg	0

For the people supporting &quot;carbon free&quot;, I suggest the majority, if not all, of them live either in a highly suburban or urban areas. Furthermore, the majority, if not all, of them live in states that are highly urbanized. The difference is that services are highly localized and accessible for urban dwellers. Transportation to and from those locations are easily served by mass transit or by short range electric vehicles. For those states that are not highly urbanized, it is a totally different story. Distances are vast, for instance, most villages in Alaska is only accessible by small plane or a Tribal reservation in North Dakota is 70 miles to buy groceries. Nothing exists in those locations that make electric vehicles better replacement than what they have. Furthermore, the agriculture that produces cheap food for the USA is located in rural areas. The rural portion of the equation is the biggest hurtle &quot;carbon free&quot; has to overcome to be feasible as a national policy. Perhaps it is a better used an urban core policy, like Amsterdam, which only allows private electric vehicles in the city.

If you jsut look at the abstract of Shaun A. Marcott&#39;s Research he says: Current global temperatures of the past decade have not yet exceeded peak interglacial values but are warmer than during ~75% of the Holocene temperature history.¬†In contrast, the decade 1900-1909 was cooler than~95% of the Holocene. Therefore, we conclude that global temperature has risen from near the coldest to the warmest levels of the Holocene in the past century. Further, we compare the Holocene paleotemperature distribution with published temperature projections for 2100 CE, and find that these projections exceed the range of Holocene global average temperatures under all plausible emissions scenarios.¬†That basically mean that there were ups and down but all within the limit of what has been recorded during the last 10,000 years. WE ARE CURRENTLY NOT ABOVE THE HIGHEST TEMPERATURE EVER RECORDED within 10,000 years.

Well it is wrong in the sense that it gives you one path and says that this is the way to fix it. We can achieve the same end goal and not do everything that was said in this video. Tying the presidential race to this is where I get mad. This is a government of the people and we need to talk with our politicians at the city, county, state, and federal level. This needs to start from the people and move up. One president will not change this. You also can&#39;t ruin one person and benefit someone else. A shift in policy will hurt many people who don&#39;t deserve to be hurt. That is why it needs to be a whole country effort starting with the people. We the people force change, not the government forcing us to change.	UC5tkUMA7oMGSiYOSmxfR9VQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5tkUMA7oMGSiYOSmxfR9VQ	0

Protecting domestic manufacturing but doing so in a way that begins to capture the cost to the planet. Ideally this would be setup to encourage investment in renewables-powered shipping, ground transport, and air travel. To my knowledge, free trade agreements like USMCA and the TPP have been tied to everything but the climate. Anyone have additional reading on these issues?

The best of the worst solution is fossil fuel hate to break it. But how do you make electricity anyway? Wind,water, geothermal or solar.. those thing are not enough for we know that we consume more electricity than these environmental powerplants can provide and, also we use more resources and lots of lands to keep it operational. It seems to never work on practice only in paper. For example just compare Germany&#39;s power consumption vs France&#39;s let&#39;s just say in 2019. Just see it for yourself. The best way is Nuclear and the best of the worst is fossil fuels. But i do believe we don&#39;t have the solution yet... But i also believe that we can overcome this problem in the near future.

Of course that may have meant a couple more Fukushima level accidents in the last 50 years, but I guess compared to the teratonnes of CO2 emissions saved over that period, it may have been a price worth paying. And it&#39;s likely the reactors we would be building today would be cheaper, more efficient and safer than the enormously expensive monsters we&#39;re still considering.

Batteries, for instance, would need to be recycled and properly disposed of, and those aren‚Äôt things we can easily deal with. We would also have to slash a massive amount of jobs or retrain thousands to millions of employees. People working in the fossil fuel sector would lose their jobs and whole nations would lose their incomes. <br />Further upgrades on infrastructure would be massive.<br />Nuclear is our best option for power. It is the most efficient and takes up less space, not to mention cheaper.
