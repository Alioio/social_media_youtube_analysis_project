And that we should do our best too keep politics out of the sciences. There are a great many discoveries that are made through finding the mistakes. I am not saying any of these scientists are wrong. All i am saying is some articles are not considering all there is too be considered. Most people know that we are complete idiots to understanding all the cycles and things that effect the earth. There is proof that places have been hotter and colder, greener and drier than they are right now. So many things come into play. I watched an amazing video last week ( that i barely understood) about how they are watching 45 different millisecond pulsars to get an exact position on the earth and have noticed that gravitational waves are moving and squeezing the earth. Sometimes up too 100 ft ( and this is not a complete range of what we can measure) and they ‚Äúcould‚Äù be responsible for volcanic activity on the planet. I wonder what those gravitational waves could do too the environment or animals?

Also it‚Äôs incredibly hard to get the whole world to come together to solve an issue. So the fact they did that for the Paris climate accord shows you that everyone is taking this very seriously.

There needs to be a stop to the corporate housing grab happening all across middle class America now. Corporations are buying up all the affordable homes all cash leaving little to no options for working class people. they take these homes and charge extremely high rent therefore driving the home affordable crises in America. Something needs to be done about the source of the crises not just throwing good money at bad. we also need to teach personal finance in schools. I was so shocked at how little people now about personal finance when they go out into the world as young people.	UC_OI6DX5qNqY84BQ3suX_oQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_OI6DX5qNqY84BQ3suX_oQ	0

We're each state maybe different, not sure what they require now or what is alective, but at one time, home economics, book keeping, typing, wood working are just few classes that was provided. Vocational in higher grades, building trade, electronics, auto body, florist, forestry, cored on blues, child care, nursing, plumbing, the list could go on.
