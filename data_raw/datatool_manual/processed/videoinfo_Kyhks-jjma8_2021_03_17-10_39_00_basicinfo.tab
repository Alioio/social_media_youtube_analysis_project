title	Why Scientific Truth Is Not Working for Climate Change | Kenneth Van den Bergh | TEDxKULeuven
description	Many ideas, fueled by science, have already been pulled out of 'the urn of invention' to reduce our negative impact on the environment. But is this power of scientific truth working for climate change? Kenneth Van den Bergh, owner of a non-profit dedicated to climate change and a researcher at the KU Leuven in the Energy & Environment group, will explore this question with you. Kenneth Van den Bergh is a co-founder of Carbon+Alt+Delete. Carbon+Alt+Delete is a non-profit organization with the mission to mitigate climate change by informing and activating people. Carbon+Alt+Delete offers a user-friendly tool to calculate carbon emissions. Besides, people can compensate their carbon emissions by supporting renewable energy projects. Kenneth holds a PhD in Mechanical Engineering, a MSc in Energy Engineering and a MSc in Management, all from the KU Leuven. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx
