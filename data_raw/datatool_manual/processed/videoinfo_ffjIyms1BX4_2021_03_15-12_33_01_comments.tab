And where can I confirm this? Thanks."* It means that measures of solar activity (such as sunspot numbers and TSI [total solar irradiance]) have not correlated well with post-1970s global warming. Here are some sources on this: "One of the “smoking guns” that tells us the sun is not causing global warming comes from looking at the amount of the sun’s energy that hits the top of the atmosphere. Since 1978, scientists have been tracking this using sensors on satellites and what they tell us is that there has been no upward trend in the amount of the sun’s energy reaching Earth." http://climate.nasa.gov/faq/?

UgiK-g4YyPBFMXgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-CNQY8SRFkhy_7eF		1	2017-05-11 20:04:50	W. Hoffman	+Never going straight Many people confuse the idea of anthropogenic global warming with thoughtless pollution. They are not the same at all, and my best way to say it is that your exhaled breath in a day contributes more CO2 than all your cell phone usage, and probably more in a year even counting the additional CO2 to manufacture the cell phone. [..and I say that even while stating that CO2 does not make the Earth warm, nor does more CO2 make it still warmer]. You are in balance simply because your biology as a human is that *of* the Earth, and even to the extent you ski, you do more to the snow by skiing on it than you do by breathing. Just don't go burning forests down (and even that is not "irreversible"). "Polluting" by careless release of wastes other than carbon, on the other hand leads to different issues, including spoiling views, making others clean up after them, and things that interfere with others enjoying their lives, but I frankly don't see how a 14-year old can be negatively active in that area, and yet showing the concern you have for our environment. So be of good cheer and be confident that in your person there is no harm created to the environment, and if there is any sort of influence, it is of a type the Earth has handled for millions of years.

It's true that the environmental impact of manufacturing green'energy often goes overlooked by green energy advocates, and this is definitely a problem that deserves more scrutiny. Really, it's the same deal with your second question, just in a different domain, although it seems by the way you phrased your question that you already have a good start on answering it yourself. I will say though that my intuition tells me that unless some electric vehicle manufacturer was being *excessively* dirty in their process, EVs are probably guaranteed to be cleaner in the long run than their gas burning counterparts - but I don't know how to quantify this. Regarding your third question: can we ever stop man-made climate change? Yes, I think it's possible, but only if we all collectively leave the planet behind and go find a new environment to live in - and then we'll just start changing that climate, simply because we're active agents in a (somewhat) closed system. Every action we take as a species has consequences for ourselves and everyone sharing our space. Beyond that, I think it will be possible to *modify* our contribution to the changes our climate is undergoing, but I don't think it'll ever be possible to stop contributing altogether. However, I think 'doomed' is probably an overreaction. Change is inevitable, regardless of whether it's human-caused or not, but change doesn't necessarily mean chaos, turmoil, or suffering. I also think some of the hype regarding the consequences of climate change are overly dramatic at best and downright misleading at worst, depending on who you're listening to for your apocalypse forecast. My advice, if you're anxious about such dire predictions, is to consider that the human species has survived very dramatic climate shifts during its short existence, and while things might get difficult for us for a while, it very likely won't be *anywhere near* as bad as the media is saying it's going to be. Lastly: You're 14 and you're asking questions that adults three times your age don't bother asking. The fact that you're actively seeking answers to those questions (instead of just passively hoping someone else will come along to hand them to you) is just incredible, and the fact that you're actually allowing new information to *change your mind* - well it's people like you that give me hope for my species. Hold on to that skill - it will serve you very, very well in life. +W. Hoffman - I am also curious to see your answers to these questions, especially since I wasn't really able to give any decent answers. =)	UCe6F8U2ItahzcJQMiQZbS9A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe6F8U2ItahzcJQMiQZbS9A	1	UgiK-g4YyPBFMXgCoAEC	Erik

Damn right. That kind of behavior harms not only the people who are deceived by it, but the entire scientific enterprise by turning what is supposed to be a tool for discovery and enlightenment into a malicious weapon that serves only greed. If you have some evidence that the current state of the AGW hypothesis is informed by this kind of thinking, then I *absolutely* want to see that. "not meant to suggest you or anyone else is a moron." That was kind of a knee-jerk reaction and I apologize; a lot of people like to be rude on the internet, but that doesn't give me license to assume. I understand what you mean now - although I'll remind you that "1+1=2" is only axiomatically true, and thus only as solid as the axioms upon which it is laid. =P I'm not a climate scientist, so I don't know really know whether the AGW hypothesis is flawed or not. I tend to outsource the knowledge-gathering to field experts, and I tend to trust those experts regarding their findings. I think that most people do this, whether they profess a distrust of science in general or not. I'm aware of bias and deception, but I think that most professionals are decent, honest people who are as interested in understanding reality as I am. Optimistic, perhaps, but that's just where I'm at with all this. When I do find evidence of bias or deception, naturally I adjust my internal models appropriately - but I'm not going to preemptively distrust scientists or their findings. I'd be stuck in the dark ages if I did that consistently. As far as the details regarding the experiment my science teacher had us perform - alas, no, I don't remember very much at all aside from the results I personally gathered. I'd like to be able to describe the setup in detail, but I only have very vague visual memories from then. It was a long time ago and those memories have been stepped on a lot in the intervening years - but that's what I get for trying to record data into meat and fats. =P I'll do some research into the experiments you mentioned and see if any bells ring. "what it was about it that convinced you that "anthropogenic global warming" was well modeled by it?" - Eh, I wouldn't say that. The purpose of the experiment was only to demonstrate and quantify the greenhouse effect on a small scale, not to model climate change. If you're asking me why I'm convinced that AGW is well modeled in general, well I wouldn't say that either. I would say that my level of certainty here is maybe 70%. If I was more directly informed on the topic, I could revise that probability estimate, but alas, there are only so many hours in a day, and I don't really find climate science to be very fulfilling of a field, personally. I'm more into astronomy, chemistry, and physics although I'm not a professional in any of these fields. As far as *why* I think AGW is more likely than not a factor in climate change - well I think I covered that in my previous reply, but I'll restate: nothing lives in a vacuum, and the things we do as a species affect our environment on a global scale. Specifically, the carbon in the fuels we burn at gigaton levels annually has to go somewhere, and since there's none left behind after combustion (ideally), that 'somewhere' can only be the atmosphere. It isn't a very big leap to go from 'CO2 is demonstrated to be a greenhouse gas' to 'increasing the amount of global CO2 in the atmosphere will result in a commensurate increase in the global greenhouse effect.' To be clear, I don't think that humans are the *only* causal factor - far from it - and I'm still unsure just how much impact we really have in the grand scheme of things. Complex systems are difficult to model and predict, and I am pretty much entirely out of my depth when it comes to climate models. But I do trust the experts who we rely on to investigate these things. "I ask because sometimes we get shown things, and even by good teachers, the things are wrong..." - If you're implying that my teacher used this experiment as a comment on climate change, I could be wrong but I don't think this was the case. My memory is pretty foggy here but I don't think climate change was even discussed, or if it was it was more hypothetical than anything else. You are correct, however, in that sometimes well-meaning authorities allow ideological biases to impact their work. We are all human, and nobody is immune to bias. All we can do is correct for our biases when we spot them, as best we can. "Do you know why there are high tides on both sides of the earth at the same time?" - If this was covered in any of my science classes (and it's likely that it was), I don't remember. However, I have seen several differing pop-sci explanations, none of which I can recall the details for at the moment - but this is the kind of factoid that I tend to outsource to google for remembering. I haven't been interested enough in the question to really dig into any of the explanations I've heard to suss out what's true, though. You've got me curious though; where are you going with this? =) "Life goes on." That it does, that it does. Thank you, by the way, for the conversation so far - it's rare to hold an intellectual discussion in youtube comments on a hot-button issue without it devolving into ad hominems and general asshattery. =P	UCe6F8U2ItahzcJQMiQZbS9A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe6F8U2ItahzcJQMiQZbS9A	1	UgiK-g4YyPBFMXgCoAEC	Erik
UgiK-g4YyPBFMXgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-CNQY8SE3KmVJEje		0	2017-05-06 17:06:10	W. Hoffman	+Erik On the basis of what you wrote in the post starting with (E:): "Yes, I read your entire post.", I don't see all that much to disagree on. Mostly, you are talking about choices we humans may make, and truth be known, I'd rather see o&g reserves used for medicine, building materials, plastics, adhesives and the whole panoply of constructive products they make possible, than simply burning them up. I also favor moving to a nuclear energy production system, and eventually a fusion-based economy (with hydrogen for transportation). What I won't put up with (and the entire thrust of all my posts on the topic, both here and on my own channel, is based on this) is being bullied by people selling a fear, cloaked in scientific terms. Not only is it fundamentally dishonest, but if we can be sold scientific error in the name of the "greater good", we can be sold anything. I don't see you doing this, but it is behind most of the AGW anxiety, so I made myself clear. WH: "1+1=2; therefore AGW is true" is *not* meant to suggest you or anyone else is a moron. It is only to suggest that if you consider the foundation of the AGW theory, and find it flawed (which 1+1=2 is not), then everything built on it is fragile, suspect. Your comment that you did an experiment in 3d grade that showed warming suggests you had some version of Fourier's experiments recreated by your teacher. Since this brings the discussion back to science, I'd like to pursue it. Realizing it was now 28 years ago, I don't suppose you recall the details, but can I ask what it was about it that convinced you that "anthropogenic global warming" was well modeled by it? Have you reexamined it, now knowing what you have learned in the intervening years, or do you regard it as bedrock, on which all else is built? I ask because sometimes we get shown things, and even by good teachers, the things are wrong...no intention to misguide implied...simply error. I will use a concrete example that ultimately has relevance to the whole climate, and if you don't mind, I'll do it with a question related to 3d grade science class. *Do you know why there are high tides on **_both_** sides of the earth at the same time?* BTW, I don't think YT marks anything as "spam". Someone who didn't like my comments was trying to game the YT system. Life goes on.	UCr5JhGiDxlQ9vJTRGN8kh0w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr5JhGiDxlQ9vJTRGN8kh0w	1	UgiK-g4YyPBFMXgCoAEC	Erik

Firstly, as science and reality are not determined by consensus, the existence of lack thereof of "the 97%" is and irrelevant red herring. Secondly, while I know I didn't specifically ask you for your source: When you make a claim and are asked for the source material, "just google" is not sufficient. You can "just google" and come up with ample nonsense to back up literally any claim you'd like to make. The point of asking for sources is so that I can evaluate *your source* to determine whether I think it's credible.

Sorry, I was in a hurry and wasn't prepared to precisely qualify my position on AGW, especially as I've already done so a few times in this 200-comment-long thread. Alas, no, I don't expect anyone to read through this entire monstrosity, but repeating myself gets tiring, I still don't understand what you were trying to say with the '2+2 = 4 therefore AGW' thing. It's pretty clear by your tone that you think I'm a moron. Are you suggesting that I'm simply taking the claims I hear at face value without doing some fact checking? As for 'keeping the faith' - I don't keep faith. I threw that out a long time ago along with dogma and superstition. Further, I try very hard not to tie my identity to my beliefs, and so generally don't have as difficult a time changing beliefs as others might. This was a difficult skill to acquire, and while I still haven't quite mastered it (I'm only human) I think I do pretty well these not to get upset when my erroneous beliefs are corrected. I try to be open to all the evidence, not just that which comports with my already established views. (Key word: try. It's *hard work* and echo chambers are just so easy to belong to.) If you've got something to share that add to the discussion, then please share it. The science on greenhouse gasses is, as I mentioned earlier in this thread, elementary-school-level. A 3rd grade child could demonstrate the greenhouse effect with a variety of gasses as well as quantify each one's specific contribution - in fact, I along with the rest of my 3rd grade science class back in 1989 did exactly that. (Our control was vacuum - needless to say, the teacher handled that apparatus for us.) CO2 is not the only greenhouse gas, nor is it (by unit) the most potent. Methane is a *really* bad one, and water vapor (the most abundant greenhouse gas in our atmosphere) is up there too. I think the reason CO2 is discussed so much is because our contribution to worldwide CO2 levels is *massive* and easy to notice on a graph. Quantifying global CO2 isn't exactly grade-school science, but it's straightforward and easily understood by your average educated layman. I don't really see any reason to doubt the measurements that have been taken, by multiple independent parties - error bars notwithstanding. The thing about climate change is that there is no *one cause*. Humans play a role, as well as a myriad of other systems in our lovely biosphere. Nothing exists in a vacuum, and everything we do has consequences of some sort. As far as the specific consequences of our involvement in mucking with global climate; I'm taking all predictions with the appropriate amount of salt. We are notoriously bad at predicting the behavior of complex systems, and climate is a *beast* to model with any sort of accuracy. I will say that the general theme - bad times ahead - is probably accurate, although to what degree is anyone's guess. Personally, I've been on-board with reducing humanity's carbon footprint long before climate change became a hot-button issue. Fossil fuels are so 19th century. Oh, and - I don't know why, but Youtube flagged your two most recent replies as spam, and is not allowing me to undo that. Dunno what's up.

Hoffman	DM584 As a former member of a consensus-based standards organization, I found much of your commentary this time "non-persuasive". In most cases, you simply restated your original arguments, and I remain unimpressed with the 97% number. Nor are the respondents "lying"; the very harshness of the assertion rhetorically designed (yet again) to deflect. Most are honestly saying what they believe, but it is the presentation of such a survey that is dishonest: intended to be _argumentum ad vericundiam_ and implying that only "experts" (priest class folk) are qualified to speak _ex cathedra_ . Bunk! (that's a rhetorical term). And just so you know, Jesuits are not just priests who have faith. Jesuit studies take 12 years and are as tough as many military academies, and then some go on to earn Ph.D.s. They are as expert in what the Bible says as any climate scientist is in what the AGW catechism says. Doesn't make either group right, that "expertise". But I don't care what the Bible says, and my interest in the subject area of climate is based on my interest in science, not belief in an outcome, but in the process by which outcomes can be deduced. Your item 7 has this: "That doesn't mean that climate science has no basis in physics." I'm sure. What is it, do you know? You asked about my background. Ph.D.? Yeah I've got one of those. You?

UgiK-g4YyPBFMXgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-CNQY8S7kNHK9QM0		0	2017-05-04 06:16:19	Atomsk's Sanakan	+W. Hoffman *"1. Do you think there's no way a poll could yield such results without bias?"* Yup. Just like a poll could yield a 99% consensus on human evolution among PhD, research biomedical scientists. For example: http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/07/23/an-elaboration-of-aaas-scientists-views/ This is because experts in a scientific field are more likely to know about evidence in that field, how to reason in that field, etc. So if there's solid evidence in that field, a consensus will usually form among the experts. This consensus might not extend to non-experts, since the non-experts are more likely to be ignorant of the science, not understand how to reason about that scientific field, etc. That point applies to evolutionary biology just as it applies to climate science. *"2. If it were truly 97%, could you not imagine the questions were framed to leave no chance?"* The results have been replicated by independent research groups, using different questions framings. You'd know this if you bothered to read any of the sources I've been citing to you for months. This is shown in: "Consensus on consensus: a synthesis of consensus estimates on human-caused global warming" Figures 88 (v043) and 2 (v007) of "The Bray and von Storch 5th International Survey of Climate Scientists 2015/2016" https://www.hzg.de/imperia/md/content/hzg/zentrale_einrichtungen/bibliothek/berichte/hzg_reports_2016/hzg_report_2016_2.pdf The ~90% consensus attributing recent global warming to humans, as shown on page 49 of: "Model, manifestation and attribution of climate change" *"3. Aren't you the least bit suspicious of a survey of "climate scientists" whose livelihood depends on their beliefs?"* No, because that's just a silly, paranoid conspiracy theory you have. Scientists don't just en masse make up conclusions to match their funding sources. Otherwise, most scientists would have stopped citing evidence of AGW under AGW denialist, politically conservative administrations; yet that didn't happen. And if AGW research was just a money-motivated conspiracy, then you would not expect such as broad scientific consensus to hold across scientists from different political/governmental systems; yet such a consensus did arise: "Consensus on consensus: a synthesis of consensus estimates on human-caused global warming" Nor would you expect the scientific consensus to be supported by multiple lines of evidence, including from evidence from non-government-funded studies, studies that were done before there was much of a political rationale for funding climate science research, and studies that lack a politically-motivated funding rationale; yet we do have such lines of evidence. It also makes no sense to claim that these scientists are just lying for the sake of funding, or because their field depends on it. After all, climate science is an old field (dating back to the 1800s) that includes more than anthropogenic climate change, just like oncology/cancer is a field that includes more than smoking-induced cancer. So scientists can get funding to study non-anthropogenic climate change, just like oncologists can get funding to explore cancer that isn't caused by smoking. Thus, it makes little sense to claim that climate scientists are all lying to prop up their field, just like it makes little sense to claim that doctors are all lying (to prop up their field) when they claim that smoking causes cancer. To claim otherwise, is to show that you ignorantly believe that climate science is just about anthropogenic climate change. Furthermore, you seem to have little understanding of how grant funding is awarded. It isn't awarded based on researchers guaranteeing that their research will support an accepted, pre-determined consensus conclusion. In fact, the research that gets the most attention, prestigious prizes (ex: Nobel prizes), etc. is research that overturns accepted conclusions or breaks new ground, as opposed to just supporting the consensus position. Grant proposals may offer hypotheses to test, but the proposals typically leave open the possibility that the hypotheses will not be confirmed and instead a novel conclusion may be supported. For example, they might propose testing one of the predictions of AGW theory. Those sorts of studies are often funded. And they often end up getting evidence that supports the predictions of AGW, even though it wasn't it was always possible for them to have disconfirmed the predictions. Anyway, grant funding is awarded based on things such as the proposal writers previously publication record (to show that you can do published research, when given money), preliminary data presented in the proposal, how well the proposal writers know the field (as displayed in their grant proposal), whether the proposal writers have access to the equipment/tools needed for their proposed project, etc. You'd know this if you'd ever bothered to apply for a research grant, spoken with scientists who'd applied for such grants, looked up the grant proposal guidelines (which are freely available on the NIH website, NASA website, etc.), or spoken with grant reviewers. I've done all four of these. Trying doing those 4 things some time. *"4 [...]"* Your questions 4 - 6 are silly red herrings based on you not grasping the difference between an evidence-based scientific consensus vs. topics like politics, business, etc. *"7. Of the 97%, what part is involved in the fundamental physics of AGW, do you think?"* The 97% consensus includes the following claims: A1) There has been global warming since the mid-20th century. A2) Humans (largely via anthropogenic greenhouse gases) caused most of this recent warming. A3) Most of the recent (or near future) climate change is (or will be) caused by humans.

One way of clarifying it, although it will not succeed to the satisfaction of everyone, is that it does not make sense to poll the Jesuit community on the Bible. 97% will agree it's correct. So what? 3. Among the deflections is DM:"The climate scientists wouldn't have derived any direct benefit from answering the poll either way." Really? No *direct benefit*? Someone who has made a career out of studying climate change? It's absurd to contend that merely by having "no direct benefit", they would answer that they had been working uselessly.

The entire study topic would revert to making TV travelogs, with Ubangis and their neck rings. There might even be some good science done then without the pressure to prove that CO2 and industry was killing the world. 7. WH (previous comment): "Of the 97%, what part is involved in the fundamental physics of AGW, do you think?" and DM deflects again " Well, none of them are strictly physicists - they're climate scientists. However, almost all of them would collaborate with physicists when necessary for help with interpreting their findings." In case the point is too obscure, the answer is *none*. The physics and science for "climate scientists" is not a part of the study, and they will "collaborate with physicists when necessary..." There can be nothing of AGW theory more necessary than establishing its roots in physics, and the "scientists" you refer to are collecting specimens and claiming they're affected by AGW, not establishing AGW as solid physics, nor CO2 as a primary cause. Do you know that the CO2 Forcing equation is nothing more than a curve-fitting expression that has no foundation in heat capacity, or such basic physics as PV=nRT? What the heck good is it to poll the nuns in the choir about the catchism? Pong!	UCr5JhGiDxlQ9vJTRGN8kh0w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr5JhGiDxlQ9vJTRGN8kh0w	1	UgiK-g4YyPBFMXgCoAEC	Erik

I didn't mean to deny that climate change is occuring and I don't deny global warming is happening as well, but it could very likely be part of a normal climate cycle. My argument I was trying to make, which I admit that I did a poor job explaining, is that it is not true 97% of the Scientists agree on what it is that is causing this global warming (which is why on the NASA link it says it is 'likely' to be human activity) and if it is directly correlated to human activity. Taking it a step further, I am nervous about handing over more authority to a centralized power (American Government) to be able to manipulate the private market and to allow them to unfairly discriminate against companies who have helped build this industrialized world using fossil fuels. And the dumb ass sheep comment was just a troll comment ;) but I completely understand your point. Thanks for not being a dueche.

If you saw 97% in an article about Kim Jong Un's election to lead Korea, would you believe the election was free? 5.

The biological mechanisms which actually alter the DNA and bring about evolutionary change are not understood well enough to be predictive. Imagine if we made a computer model based on past evolutionary changes and tried to use that to predict future evolutionary changes. I'm not asserting this is equivalent, it's just a thought. With the climate, people seem to be walking back human extinction predictions related to climate change, at least that's what I'm getting from some quarters. That is my main beef, we are being provoked through fear to make radical societal changes based on science which is very young (The Satellite data starts in the 70's)and which apparently is no longer predicting a climate apocalypse. I reminds me of the eugenics movement. I believe science, but I don't trust people.	UCXu3sQgVxR31DUebSwh5OAg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXu3sQgVxR31DUebSwh5OAg	1	UgiK-g4YyPBFMXgCoAEC	Erik

As other people replying to my comments will tell you, I have not read all the peer-reviewed scientific literature. I'm not a strong believer in climate change, but I definitely lean in that direction. I think all our burning stuff is going to impact the climate. The thing that drives me nuts is that I all I ever hear about climate science is second hand, it's people telling me this or that about climate change. Now, I don't really get into climate conversations often, I think this video is my first. This is not my subject. But we are being asked to make major changes to essentially avert a disaster. This consensus demands action. This is not like the consensus over evolution. Outside of science and education, the consensus over evolution does not make demands of society. The consensus over climate makes demands. And it makes threats. And if people outside climate science start to question climate science, one can hardly be surprised, they are not merely asking us to take their findings as authoritative. They are asking us to act on their predictions. And whatever one wants to say about climate science, the predictions are still non-specific enough to cause me to believe they really don't know what the effect of climate change will be, and that their science is still quite primitive.

That is a legitimate criticism. A Physicist may not know much about the climate, but he may know how science is done. So such an expert is completely fit to judge and criticize the science being done by climate scientists. When I was a kid, 100% of paleontology books agreed that dinosaurs lumbered along dragging their tails behind them. At some point someone suggested that the anatomy was wrong and he was instantly in the minority. Majority opinion at any moment in time is not a scientific result.

It's a manufactured controversy, where people pretend that there's more scientific debate occurring then there actually is. This is a typical tactic of denialists, whether they be AIDS denialists, creationists, or anthropogenic global warming (AGW) denialists: "This article examines three cases that have been identified by scholars as “manufactured” scientific controversies, in which rhetors seek to promote or delay public policy by announcing that there is an ongoing scientific debate about a matter for which there is actually an overwhelming scientific consensus. The comparative study of argumentative dynamics in the cases of AIDS dissent, global warming skepticism, and intelligent design reveals the deployment of rhetorical traps that take advantage of balancing norms and appeals to democratic values." https://muse.jhu.edu/article/440840 "The opponents of evolution and global warming face a formidable challenge: to convince the public and decision-makers that there is significant dissent among scientists in two fields where in reality a strong consensus exists.

If 3% are not agreeing with a vast majority, that is one of the the hottest kinds of debate. When there is a 50-50 divide it is usually recognized that there is some question and the debate is more or less for fun, since there is a large diversity of opinion. But when you question the seemingly unquestionable, that is indeed one hot debate. So yes, a debate in which 97% of scientists agree can be a very hot debate.

With any bold claim (such as AGW), the first response must be "Prove it". Proof is not "we know all these fancy things, trust us". That is statistically invalid, with confirmation bias being primary. Proof is "I have this equally bold prediction - do you agree how different this is from the null hypothesis?" Then everyone tests said prediction and is forced to accept the result as strong evidence. This has not happened (the major predictions have all been way off the mark), which to me is strong evidence that these leading "scientists" have NFI. Then you factor in things like unannounced revisions of raw data - see https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/feb/08/no-climate-conspiracy-noaa-temperature-adjustments-bring-data-closer-to-pristine - this is what I consider to be a Data Science Crime. There is no excuse for altering *raw* data - but you are very welcome to publish an additional "improved" series. It all looks much the same as Economic "Science", whose predictive power is best demonstrated by the whole "no-one saw this coming" of the GFC. But don't worry, both Climate Scientists and Economists will continue making bold predictions! One day I'll have a bucket of funds from my endeavours, and I'll ensure that actual science is performed on a bunch of important subjects. I like science and scientists, and I strongly dislike salesmen in labcoats who call themselves scientists. My ideal team would have a believer, a denier and several who don't know but really want to discover the truth.

This is well within natural variability. I think the issue with where I am sitting is that I am submerged in research. I am aware of the uncertainties in research. For many people who aren't scientists or haven't conducted research, they often look at scientists and their papers as factual. The thing is, it isn't and that is my whole point. I don't believe in the factual basis that is being thrown around right now. You either believe that our industrial by-products are the leading cause of the current climate variability or you are a baboon. This case is absurd. I don't even know where to begin because it is extremely hard for me to believe data. You can link me a heavily cited ice core record paper and I will at it and see -70/+70y variability with spill over (that can't be accounted for in data variability analysis). You can link me a geochemical analysis of surface water levels in Australia and I will see concentration bias via secondary factors that were not looked at (because of funding publication e.g. deep sea gas expulsion). You can link me a chart on carbon ratio concentrations in lower atmosphere which points to an archaic atmosphere and I won't even care. Because a) so what? b) this proves nothing & c) what is the chemistry of a notch higher atmosphere and why wasn't this accounted for? Heck you could link me a paper on glacial melt and I will ask a) why is glaciers growing (on average) b) why would their breaking have to do with temperature vs surface area pressure & c) if they are breaking because of temperature i) how do you know this ii) show me your experiment iii) how do you know the heating was due to human activity? My point being, as a skeptic and as an objective scientist I don't like interpretation.Singularities are my game. So when I see climatologists who smooth graphs and make strong conclusions based on their data..I have to do a face palm. But it is even stupider as they win awards, get more grant money and policy is built on their research. Let me tell you, geometric secular variation in ionosphere storm nucleation..not as pretty sounding as "humans are fucking up the earth, eh." But anyways, my point is..I am skeptical and when you ask me for "evidence" of human activity not causing the currently climate well......my evidence is my skeptical opinion based on issues with conclusions of the scientists own lab data	UCq_IBy6lIaXusi1Y_UEhOyg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq_IBy6lIaXusi1Y_UEhOyg	1	UgiK-g4YyPBFMXgCoAEC	Erik

Oh, look - he wrote a book called "The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels", which "champions the use of fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas." Interesting. He's a 'former fellow' of the Ayn Rand institute - also interesting, considering Rand's general philosophical position that there's no such thing as 'bad for the environment'. Oh, and look - he's an 'adjunct scholar' of the Cato Institute, which just happens to have been founded by Charles Koch, CEO of Koch Industries, which *just happens to be* a major carbon fuel producer in the form of ethanol, and which made all its original vast fortune refining oil. It's amazing what you can find using Google these days. Yes, I'm sure Mr. Epstein is completely above-board and not in any way biased to maintain the industry he and his friends are currently profiting from at our great expense.

The main fears that humans will cause the earth to dry up and most life to die is far fetched to say the least. We are still more likely to be hit lighting,meteor or nuclear bomb, die from leaded bacterial water and so on- screw climate change- I still have a over loaded plate when it comes to aborting apocalypses and if your think your gonna take the gas out of me, you need an alternative fuel first so blame apple and google for not spending a dime to help humanity not busy ants trying to survive.

The 'greenhouse effect' science is dead-simple to understand - I learned about it in my 3rd grade science class back in the late 80s. What isn't so clear is what the long-term effects will be, and honestly I think the apocalyptic predictions are just as much about marketing and scare-mongering as religious apocalypses are. It seems very obvious and easy to understand, to me, how an increase in greenhouse gasses leads to an increase in trapped heat on a global scale. CO2, water vapor, methane - it is trivial to verify, *personally*, that these are indeed greenhouse gasses - so trivial a child could put together an experiment that proves it. It is also trivial to understand how our use of fossil fuels correlates to an increase in atmospheric CO2 when you come to understand combustion products - another 3rd grade science topic. When you burn something containing carbon, you oxidize it - and that carbon has to go somewhere. Since there's none left in the remaining ash, it *must* have escaped in the form of gas. *This is trivial*. I don't understand how people don't get it.

UgiK-g4YyPBFMXgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-CNQY8BVlGVmcA-q		1	2016-03-17 01:12:12	Red Baron Farm	The proof that man-made CO2 is causing global warming is like the chain of evidence in a court case. CO2 keeps the Earth warmer than it would be without it. Humans are adding CO2 to the atmosphere, mainly by burning fossil fuels. But maybe as importantly, by degrading the ecosystems responsible for returning that CO2 back into the earth/soil. And there is empirical evidence that the rising temperatures are being caused by the increased CO2.  One way of measuring the effect of CO2 is by using satellites to compare how much energy is arriving from the sun, and how much is leaving the Earth. What scientists have seen over the last few decades is a gradual decrease in the amount of energy being re-radiated back into space. In the same period, the amount of energy arriving from the sun has not changed very much at all. This is the first piece of evidence: more energy is remaining in the atmosphere and/or being reflected back.. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2011GL048794/abstract http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v410/n6826/abs/410355a0.html https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WGIAR5_SPM_brochure_en.pdf For our next piece of evidence, we must look at the amount of CO2 in the air. We know from bubbles of air trapped in ice cores that before the industrial revolution, the amount of CO2 in the air was approximately 280 parts per million (ppm). In June 2013, the NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory in Hawaii announced that, for the first time in thousands of years, the amount of CO2 in the air had gone up to 400ppm. http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/gr.html http://www.climatecentral.org/news/co2-400-ppm-global-17485 Now that is pretty secure, because it is directly measurable. CO2 is rising, and the Earth is retaining more heat from the sun than emitting. However, while the basics are secure, there is some room for debate as to why. Obviously CO2 emissions are coming from fossil fuel emissions and a few other things.But that's happened before. Why wouldn't the plants just suck it right back out. After all increasing CO2 generally makes plants grow a bit faster. That's more complicated. See about 40% of the planet land surface is affected by agriculture. Most the "prime agricultural" land is already in production. So to understand why the ecosystems that typically would have sucked that CO2 right back out, we really need to study agriculture. For example, we know the great tallgrass prairie of North America no longer exists at all. ~98% destroyed, mostly to grow corn and soy. Similar situations can be found all over the globe. So how does this effect climate? Well, the answer is, it depends really. First you lose the natural ecosystem function, then you add the artificial agricultural ecosystem that replaces it, and compare. In some cases certain agricultural practises might improve carbon sequestration over the natural ecosystems they replaced, but as a general rule MOST agriculture has been done in such a way as to reduce the carbon sequestration potential of the land. Even cutting emissions to 0 wouldn't work because the sinks are damaged. http://blogs.uoregon.edu/gregr/files/2013/07/grasslandscooling-nhslkh.pdf http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/12/1209_051209_crops_map.html http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/only-60-years-of-farming-left-if-soil-degradation-continues/ http://www.grazingbestprac.com.au/research/grazing/AGEE3851%20Grazing%20management%20impacts%20in%20north%20Texas%20v12011.pdf http://sri.cals.cornell.edu/conferences/IRC2014/booth/SRI_climate_smart_rice_production_%20handout_2014.pdf http://www.thesolutionsjournal.com/node/1261 So while the issue really is a complex one, a few things are immediately obvious. 1) We are burning fossil fuels which adds to atmospheric CO2. 2) We have largely destroyed the most productive ecosystems on the land surface which are carbon sinks, and replaced them with artificial agricultural ecosystems that function much differently, usually reducing the carbon sink potential. 3)There are alternative artificial agricultural system that can function as sinks, even bigger sinks than natural ecosystems. So if currently we are adding CO2, and reducing the amount of the CO2 sink, but we know how to increase the sink, why aren't we doing that? Why the ultra leftist campaign against fossil fuels when we have a solution to the extra fossil fuel emissions already? (change agriculture to a bigger sink than even the natural ecosystems they replaced) Denialism gets you nowhere but planet earth on slow boil. But you don't have to submit to the extreme leftists either. Impossible for their solutions to work anyway. The only real solution that saves civilization is change agriculture.

UgiK-g4YyPBFMXgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-CNQY8BVkjhs7Boe		3	2016-03-17 01:07:35	TheChemist	@Erik Hi, I am a geocosmochemist graduate student. I study meteorite geochemistry and cosmodust. I have researched core samples oxygen isotope records on both poles and seen the frequencies of 18oxygen isotope to 16base oxygen. I have assisted with paleoclimate analysis of hard shell calcium carbonate temperature sensitive marine organisms. I have reviewed probably over a hundred papers on various proxy climate records. For my undergraduate thesis I analyzed tree rings and C14 analysis in sedimentation of vast bodies of preserved prehistoric organisms. On top of that I have looked at micromarine sediments in peatlands on elevated regions; heavy igneous rocky mountains. I have a plethora of experience in this field although I am not working in it (my work is far more complex) I can understand it. Unfortunately in any good science paper you will hear the OTHER story. That is, if you aren't trying to disprove what you are trying to prove, you are just trying to prove something. This holds ZERO countability and reliability in the science realm. I also don't care what other scientists do, what I care about is the science and if you would like to talk about that, I would love to share my passion. Those articles discuss hottest on record but don't talk about El Nino; post RRR atmospheric activity deflecting westerly winds. They don't talk about axil tilt or solar cycles. They don't discuss flaws in ground system thermometers or how we analyzing a system so complex that we can't even monitor reliability through our mounts of ignorance. As well..where is the discussion of 200 of years of data (roughly 70 yrs of good data accumulation) on a 4.56 billion year rock? How on earth can we conclude anything? NASA talks about acidifying oceans? We are talking about a .03/1.0 trace gas that is going to make a 8.1 (+1/-1) alkaline hydrosphere go basic? I am going to look into the math but I don't think we have enough CO2 molecules in our UNIVERSE to do this, let alone our atmosphere. NASA talks about shrinking poles? I have NEVER heard this, every paper I have read says the opposite beside one small part of Antarctica which has been breaking off due to glacial expansion and harsh solar linear activity (dating preindustrial revolution).   I am currently quite busy on a paper I am writing but tomorrow after 6 if you actually want to discuss this, I will sit down and cite papers as well as discuss my work and my findings.  	UCq_IBy6lIaXusi1Y_UEhOyg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq_IBy6lIaXusi1Y_UEhOyg	1	UgiK-g4YyPBFMXgCoAEC	Erik

Nor does what people eat have anything to do with AGW. You are displaying a complete ignorance of the biological cycles, of which carbon cycle is a small part. What you eat and what you breathe is simply cycling carbon. Cycling carbon doesn't cause AGW. What causes AGW is throwing that carbon cycle out of balance by disrupting the leg of the carbon cycle back into the soil. See you are confusing the very real effect agricultural production models have on climate with what the consumer eats. Production models that lead to soil degradation are the problem, not the consumer eating the food. Change the production model and restore the soil carbon and you can actually eat your way to mitigating AGW. In fact since it is scientifically proven that increasing soil organic matter increases agricultural productivity, you could even support more people eating even more food. The key though is changing the production model to one that maximises the carbon cycle back into the soil. In fact do it on enough land and it will even offset fossil fuel emissions.

Every single model is wrong. According to the models, the world should be 4° hotter and just simply is not yhe case. Over the last 20 years the temp has risen 3/14 of 1% of 1°. How is that a problem? Answer me this. During the "roman warm period" (you can Google that) it was at least 5° warmer than it is now. What was "mans fingerprint" then? After the dark ages when it again started to warm, how did humans force that? Climate fluctuation is a NATURAL EARTH CYCLE and NOTHING humans dobcan change that. Now the ACTUALLY climate scientists that I have researched are saying that we are in a Co2 famine right now. And since we have been pumping Co2 into the air the Polar sea ice MUCH higher that it has been. The earth is getting greener! Remember Co2 is PLANT FOOD and a natural gas. Did you know water vapor and clouds have much more to do with global warming than Co2 does. Alot of alarmists say "the science says" well where is this science? I have seen nothing but models THAT HAVE ALL BEEN WRONG. Can you show me a single climate model that has been correct? If you can show me 1 I will change my toon, but none of them have been correct. The science of climate change is not science. The business of climate change is a BUSINESS and a religion. All the real science shows that climate change is not an issue.

Regardless, no one's asking you to fear climate change. You asked about why you should care, and I think we answered that - you should care because you are part of a society that will be harmed by the near inevitability of it. People will suffer and die as a result of these changes. Maybe not you, maybe not anyone you care about, but people will die - are dying and suffering. If you don't care about that - if the only things that you care about are the things that affect you directly - then you really must be as selfish and insensitive as you seem, and I feel sorry for you.

I have wind and solar power on my homestead, but i know how to survive without electricity altogether, just like people used to in th 19th and early 20th centuries. I have a science degree majoring in biology and minor in botany. Before I did my degree I was in the army and also worked in construction with my two brothers who are carpenters. My wife is a nurse and my son is studying medicine. I live far from the coast, I have 300 acres of fertile soil (70 pasture, 230 wooded), high annual rainfall, a permanent river flowing through my land.... So why should I fear climate change? I never said that there are no repercussions for anthropogenic climate change. lots of people will undoubtedly die from it. but not me (unless there is some kind of societal collapse and i become the target of marauders, but I'm not overly concerned about that either.) People will not go extinct from climate change. the world will not end from climate change. It can not be stopped. this world will change and the weak will die. That is the harsh unavoidable truth.

Don't kill each other is ranked at number 6 behind 5 things that boil down to "do what we tell you to do". Which, by any decent moral code, is a bit screwed up. Then as Kagutsuchi said you have the pope telling people condoms help spread HIV rather than prevent it....that alone has killed thousands, plus the other things he mentions. Then you have the fact that the christian religion changes quite major things. They were fine with abortion till after the black death wiped out a big chunk of their tithing income in the 1300's. Thats when that got added in. Then there is JC's birthday being set as 25th december to match the major festival of the pagans they were trying to convert....which happened around 350AD. That is despite the fact that it doesn't match historical records of when the census was done. The entire religion is based on control of the masses and if you look at it with an unbiased view it's easy to see that. Before you say i'm looking at it biased the other way I was raised RC but when I was taught how to examine things and look for patterns and correlations it made me take a second look at religion. Now i'm firmly atheist.	UCBmhjvGY0H6NygPa2B8ExLw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBmhjvGY0H6NygPa2B8ExLw	1	UgiK-g4YyPBFMXgCoAEC	Erik

I notice you use a no true Scotsman fallacy, by saying some people who cause trouble are corrupt. In case you don't remember the vatican was against condoms, as to waste the opportunity to reproduce, according to the desert book, is a sin worthy of severe punishment. I think it's ridiculous, but killing witches, adulterers, homosexuals and sabbath workers are direct teachings of said book. Most of the warm and fuzzy stuff seems to center around the jewish people specifically, like not killing or taking slaves, but these are often condoned as long as those being killed or enslaved are not hebrew. Be honest here, have you ever really read the thing from beginning to end?	UCodTaSDenhKrwcBvFZteqoA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCodTaSDenhKrwcBvFZteqoA	1	UgiK-g4YyPBFMXgCoAEC	Erik

I support gay marriage, sex education, condoms, birth control, etc. I support vaccinations.  If there is some thing that is so true about people is that they corrupt. Them not being true believers but having one goal in mind can, has, and will again... to manipulate others to do the dirty work for you. Muslims and Christians have worked together many times. Being in the military, I also know the absence of or a difference of religion does not matter when what truly matters is that everyone works together. What I'm trying to say is that just because they claimed to be from a religion doesn't mean they were.They simply corrupted those who were ignorant of that religion and did not have a chance to learn the true concept of that religion. IF THEY DID - however - trust me; the abundance of peace, love, and trust would be more abundant, because even as a Catholic we are supposed to spread the word of God, but we are also supposed to love thy neighbor (This one of which is in the Ten Commandments) and that is what I do. They all have one main aspect (except certain "dark" cults/religions) which is to love and understand one another.  Which is why I understand two ways that the end will come. By the death of every being killing each other, or by the world coming to a complete and honest peace.

Look at america, constant pressure to teach your (assuming your christian of one flavour or another) religion alongside science. Continual lobbying against gay marriage, abortion, sex education (leading to greater teen pregnancy & STI transmission), contraception etc. Religion tries to shove it's beliefs down every bodies throats. Then there are things like the leader of the biggest single christian "faction" telling uneducated Africans that condoms help spread HIV not prevent it's spread....that alone has lead to hundreds of thousands of people contracting it who wouldn't have done if they hadn't been lied too in the name of religion. While we do need to address climate change religion is another topic that needs addressing. Funnily enough those who deny climate change are more common in the bible belt areas....co-incidence?

I have no reason to defend them. I just wanted to make a rational argument and discuss your statement, explain why there is a correlation and why correlation doesn't necessarily equal cause in this case. Don't mistake me bringing forth arguments to discuss a point as being emotionally attached to that point we're discussing, because I'm not and I wasn't. It also wasn't obvious whether you are joking or prejudging so I wanted to get that out of the way. But since you now agree that being religious and denying climate change are if at all only loosely connected, I think we're good here.

Whether it's aliens, the illuminati, planet x, the history channel, ghosts, mass scientist conspiracy or religion. Keep in mind that I say 'belief', for all of these there is a lack of evidence, for some there is contradictory evidence and some are plain silly, but that doesn't mean all of the unfounded beliefs are, by definition, not true. We just shouldn't act upon them like we do have evidence. And I think that's partly the problem. There are verses in the bible that do give the intention that we cannot do wrong with the planet. God gave us the planet to use as we please, so trust god to make sure that we can use it as we please. This is me paraphrasing the people who do use their religion to state that climate change cannot be happening. 'God' wouldn't allow it. I'll admit that, thankfully, this group is getting smaller by the year. But they are there and, alas, some of them are powerful and rich. 	UC1bunA0la2iObskhCOQQF0Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1bunA0la2iObskhCOQQF0Q	1	UgiK-g4YyPBFMXgCoAEC	Erik

Many GOP politicians and Right wing media in general has been supporting climate change denialism for years. So it's not wonder that those voters affected by it were politically on the conservative spectrum to begin with. That being said – believe it or not – there is a concerning number of non-conservative voters (libertarians, democrats, independents, what-have-you) who are also buying into the conspiracy theories now and they are oftentimes atheists. I know this because I talked to a couple of them already. So I would be very careful when making hasty judgement calls.

These were typically associated with some major stress like a mass extinction, notes Dana Royer, a climatologist at Wesleyan University. During the end-Triassic extinction 200 million years ago, for example, CO2 values jumped from about 1,300 ppm to 3,500 ppm thanks to massive volcanic eruptions in what is now the central Atlantic. That took somewhere between 1,000 to 20,000 years. Today we could conceivably change our atmosphere by thousands of parts per million in just a couple of hundred years. There’s nothing anywhere near that in the ice core records, says Keeling." https://e360.yale.edu/features/how-the-world-passed-a-carbon-threshold-400ppm-and-why-it-matters#:~:text=THE%20LONG%20VIEW,7%2C000%20ppm%20of%20carbon%20dioxide.

We don't need an ''engineering feat'' to improve our environment lol We have solar power, wind power, ethanol, one of the biggest ones *nuclear power.* There's also many things we could be doing to help as individuals as well. It's pretty ignorant to say that we don't have a ''chance'' at affecting climate change and I believe you have a sort of dogmatic way of thinking too. You want an example of how we actually reduced a large amount of CO2 in the atmosphere recently? Quarantine. People rarely going out and not driving as much has been proven to have reduced emissions dramatically and it only proves that we are well capable of affecting climate if we all are on board. Pretty bold of you to assume anything about me too, that was quite rude. To say that ''oh well there is no solutions what can you even do?'' is just optimism bias where you clearly don't care about future generations so we're just going to do nothing about it. Cheers.

Science is not "consensus", the idea that all scientists believe that there is a global climate emergency is just fanciful, the statement that 97% of climate scientists agree there is is plain wrong and a lie and finally climate science relies on physicists, chemists, atmospheric physicists, solar physicists, oceanographers, geologists, data scientists and astrophysicists and this is not comprehensive list. To say that there is agreement in all these fields is wrong. So the appeal to authority argument just doesn't work. Climate science is currently in a very prostate thanks to it's politicisation. Do what this NPC in the clip says and be curious. Ask yourself why is the historical temperature record so controversial. Why is there such discrepancy between satellite and terrestrial temperature observation and why is one chosen in preference to the other? Why is solar particle forcing and galactic cosmic particle discounted by the climate modellers despite constantly emerging evidence as to it's relevance. Scratch the surface and you'll see how much it stinks.	UCzRhvi_7tTNXxqGpILKmixg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzRhvi_7tTNXxqGpILKmixg	1	Ugxuc1ny3Ey2t7-1cHt4AaABAg	Iane Zappa

The extremes in weather and also natural disasters like tornados, fire and so on will cause that there'll be not enough food. This can cause other extremes in civilisation, everything is possible. Btw obviously other possibilities which could cause climate change have been tested as well. E.g. the sun became even colder since the measurements. Climate change, especially caused by emissions caused by humanity, has been predicted since centuries and they were always proven right when s.o. tried to falsify it. It is therefore even one of the safest theories that exist. The only thing which is practically impossible to calculate is HOW FAST EXACTLY till it's too late and most life on earth will be dead. This is obviously too complex to calculate. So it's a scientific fact that we must do something as fast as possible, cause it might be soon/already too late. For too long the oil/and other industries could prevent the USA to do something against it. And it is of course possible to live without oil/or only use it very rarely for some plastic things which really can't be replaced by something else for now. Mercedes has shown how cars should be like, with even eco friendly battery(project AVTR in Las Vegas yesterday). We must have more trains, cause this is the most eco-friendly way to travel.

The greenhouse effect is the key element in climate change, and it's of course real. It's how we use greenhouses, and even though the real world is obviously more complex and therefore harder to predict with extreme precision how fast climate will change because of it, but it is of course clear/safe THAT it changes. So far a lot of predictions were too optimistic and changes happened even faster than most experts calculated cause of all the snowball effects. All the additional natural disasters had especially much worse impacts than calculated back then. But climate experts learned from those catastrophies and calculated it again. It's impossible to calculate exactly for each year which impact it will have, but anyway we must act now must had done much much more already. Instead of calculating how fast our 'house' of nature will burn down and kills humans, we should rather act against it and try to safe it at all cost.

It's the fact that people do make it political and don't try to convince people outside of their circle of believers. Instead of paying attention to activists and politicians start reading some papers. Theres also websites like reddit that can help explain things in a a short paragraph. Theres even a "change my view" section of reddit if you're interested. If anyone has called you names or have treated you wrongly because of your beliefs then I apologize. I had to find out information on climate change myself without listening to talking points and activists who dont really know what they're talking about. Had to find the facts on my own. Took me a sec to believe in climate change. Maybe you can change your mind too.

But in the past 20 years, I have seen that average climb all the way up until November, with the snow falling less, having far more melting cycles through winter, and having spring start nearly a month earlier than it did when I was a kid. Yet people here, who have lived here and witnessed this, STILL believe it&#39;s not happening.

The CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is thus irrelevant to the greenhouse effect, because its concentration in the atmosphere doesn't affect the intensity of such effect. Here's the DOI code of such scientific paper: *10.4172/2573-458X.1000112* In a nutshell: it's not that global warming doesn't exist, but stating that it's caused (or mostly caused) by anthropic (i.e. human emissions of) CO2 is the actual flaw. Also, Nature is responsible for about 200 billion tons of CO2 that circulate in the atmosphere every year, while humans are responsible for only 9 billion tons of CO2 in the same period.

Co2 is necessary for our digestion and breath cycle. The current warming trend started at the beginning of our century, before humans started using hydrocarbons in any meaningful amount. The trend has remained the same, regardless of our contribution. Humans produce a trace of this trace gas, that is already less than 1 percent of the atmosphere and is an insignificant part of climate mechanics.

Climate alarmists claimed: - the heat was going into the deep ocean, but this theory was falsified solar variations had something to do with it… convenient aerosols (cause warming, not cooling) IPCC 2014 report “ there remains significant errors on the model simulations of clouds. It is very likely that these errors contributed significantly to the uncertainties in estimates in cloud feedback, and consequently in the climate change projections.” “These projections were not intended to be predictions over the short time scales for which observations are available to date.”	UCcbUr9ZoiufVV6am8uEFA0Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcbUr9ZoiufVV6am8uEFA0Q	1	UghOOWYuQInlrXgCoAEC	Mellanie Mellbourne

In developing countries, ( like India and Bangladesh) more rainfall can bring dangerous flooding and destruction. Some parts of India like Gujarat & Rajasthan are like fire pit in summer!

Only here it seems summer is getting more summery _and_ winter is getting more wintery--and you can notice differences just by looking around you. I have literally seen flowers that grow near me bloom in the wrong months because spring held onto frosts for too long, or be "fooled" into blooming by a sudden warm snap in early March and then BANG!--killed off by an April snowstorm. And I think: "Dude, if this is happening to the lilacs down the block from me...what is it doing to the CROPS?!"

Our Modern Warm Period is wholly natural, showing up right on schedule as one of the Holocene's 10 major warm periods on a 1,000-year cycle. Ironically, it is the coldest of the Holocene's 10, and part of a 3,000-year massive cooling trend reminiscent of the tail end of the Eemian interglacial of the current Ice Age -- just before Alaska got hit with 90,000 years of brutal cold and zero summers.

DDT is banned internationally for use in agriculture, but its use in malaria control remains permitted under the regulations of the Stockholm Convention. The production of DDT and its use in malaria control have never been discontinued. 2. While DDT is cheaper than most other insecticides, cost of manufacture has risen in proportion to that of petroleum, the major required raw material. Moreover, like other insecticides, DDT selects for resistance in the targeted insect vectors. Rising cost and widespread resistance, not regulation, are the key reasons for the limited and declining worldwide use of DDT. 3. Most malaria fatalities occur in Africa. On this continent, no comprehensive effort has ever been made to control or eradicate malaria; instead, all such projects occurred only on a local or regional scale, and many were abandoned after only a few years. 4. In the most severely affected parts of the world, only a small fraction of malaria cases are actually seen by health care workers or recorded by health authorities. Regardless of the tools employed, effective malaria control is impossible with such inadequate levels of organization and preparedness. taken from this well-sourced and well-written treatise: http://www.science.uwaterloo.ca/~mpalmer/stuff/DDT-myth.pdf	UCTDtXCngdE0mb5VTrkoNLZw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTDtXCngdE0mb5VTrkoNLZw	1	UghOOWYuQInlrXgCoAEC	Mellanie Mellbourne

[rachelwaswrong.org] As it turns out, Rachel was not wrong, and the dangers of DDT are recognized by the EPA, the World Health Organization, and various other health and environment organizations. [https://www.epa.gov/ingredients-used-pesticide-products/ddt-brief-history-and-status] Additionally, DDT was not banned indoors in areas affected by malaria, and many insect populations actually started to show resistance to it.

Malaria primarily strikes in poor tropical countries because they are warm and have pools of still water while not sanitized, not in the middle of Siberia, in the middle of nowhere (aka Russia), even though that place is not sanitized. How did you even get that info for malaria? Anyways, the Catastrophic in CAGW lets skeptics say "Oh, just a couple hundred thousand need to be removed in Pacific Islands, not catastrophic." Things like that. Also if we continue on the path of burning fossil fuels, we will get much more than just .5C to 1.0C. It's still increasing to date, and faster than any other global warming. Just look at the medival warm period. While good for much farming, some unfortunate side effects occurred because of increased chance for hurricanes, storms and flooding (looking at you, Saint Marcellus' flood). And that took many centuries. Just compare the spike we have to the spike the Medival Warm Period has and you know either something very bad happened (like asteroids, even though they actually cool the atmosphere), or something is very wrong.

CO2 levels have gone up and down for millions of years, not just since fossil fuels became popular. When CO2 levels are high the result is lush green plant growth. We have seen the emails we have seen minuscule increases in temperature over the last 100 years, less then 2 degrees C. It takes huge arrogance on the part of mankind to believe mankind can control or influence the climate, when the causes of climate change is not even known or understand. Scientist have no idea of all the variables that determine climate control. Liberal politicians are constantly lying about climate ( Al Gore & many others).

The WORST malaria outbreak occurred in origin SIBERIA. Where do you get this rubbish! No, the proper terms is CAGW. The stupid CAGW hypothesis projected doubling CO2 would cause 3C~5C of catastrophic global warming. This is now known to be 100.0000000000% impossible.

With the spread of warmth is the spread of tropical diseases (like malaria) to countries that never had that problem before, especially poor countries that don't have that problem. Plus, if AGW (notice it's called AGW, not CAGW, that's used by most of the scientific community) is correct, which 75% of scientists agree and almost none do not (the rest take a neutral stance or do not directly say it), we are going to experience much more, contributing to sea level rise, since more temp. means expanding water and melting ice. (sidenote: the Antarctic Sea Ice is currently in recovery, so it is improving, but with the trend that it has been for decades, that improvement will likely be overshadowed by more melting.) Yeah, you're right the 97% thing is complete bs, but even so in a UCSD study with 928 scientific papers made by climate scientists on Climate change found that 75% of scientists explicitly/implicitly agreed on the "consensus view", which is that global warming is real, is man-made, and is harmful to the environment and society. 25% of them said nothing on anthropogenic climate change and instead focused on paleoclimate (climate back then), and none of them disagreed with global warming. Then again, I do have a mental disorder and should totally be ignored. <------------------- *not sarcasm there*	UCJgUSBQrJIJhWjsO4r3corg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJgUSBQrJIJhWjsO4r3corg	1	UghOOWYuQInlrXgCoAEC	Mellanie Mellbourne

For example, in many Ice Ages (big or small), nature takes many centuries, but for the Little Ice Age *just so happened to reset the normal temperature and then some more in 1 century when it usually takes 4 to 5 times that*, and is increasing exponentially?

According to the silly CAGW hypothesis, the SIX datasets measuring lower troposphere global temps should be increasing FASTER than surface temp datasets because that's where the downwelling LWIR originates, but alas.... The terribly manipulated surface datasets show MUCH faster warming trends and anomalies than the SIX independent lower troposphere datasets, which should be impossible... ALLLLL scientists are well aware of the HUGE amount of heat added to surface RAW TEMP data, which is why the HUGE disparity exists... CAGW is dead, dead, dead...

Read this page and you'll see that the method they used to graph it is... not accurate to say the least. 99.84%, it says for the scientists supporting climate change. Then the editor skewed the graph to include negatives (really?) down to -500 to 100 to make the bars look very close together, but on further inspection it says "99.84% supporting climate change" and "0.16% denying climate change", then writing it off as nearly equal.

So I ask climate change deniers this question: If you truly believe climate change is a hoax, what is the incentive for these scientists to falsify their studies in order to try and prove it's real? What do they gain out of it? What's far more likely is that any research trying to disprove climate change has been falsified or funded by oil companies or even agricultural companies; powerful, influential entities that rely on the production of something shown to contribute to climate change. I'm sorry, but this just makes far more sense to me. It's got Occam's Razor written all over it.

During prolonged periods of low solar activity, oceans will eventually start COOLING. It's likely oceans AND global land temps will start to fall for the next 100 years, as the sun is quickly approaching another Grand Solar Minimum event starting from 2032... The current solar cycle is the weakest since 1906 and the next one starting from 2021 will the weakest since 1790..... The CAGW hoax is soooooooooooooo screwed....

UghOOWYuQInlrXgCoAEC.8KM1Gwpu34o8M50FwZnJtu		29	2016-12-05 01:37:46	Mellanie Mellbourne	Something as simple as remembering what month snow usually fell is not something I'm going to forget in a mere 20 or so years. What I ate for Christmas dinner in 1996? No idea. Whether it snowed in September, October, or November that same year? Easy. All of that said, scientific proof cannot rely on mere anecdote such as mine. What matters are the data and trends, and sorting through to find if the correlating data are due to causation. I am simply stating that all of the evidence makes sense to me personally, and I don't see how so many people, especially where I live, are adamant that climate change isn't real.

Over the past 4 years a rare pool of warm water (called "The Blob") surrounded Alaska, which generated inordinately warm weather around Alaska. There were also 2 El Nino events (2009/10 and 2014/16) which made Alaska's weather mild. We're just entering a La Nina event, The PDO is in its 30-yr cool cycle and "The Blob" anomaly will soon be gone. From 2017, Alaska's winters will become brutally cold, especially with the weakest solar cycle in 200 years starting from 2022....

Yes plants absorb CO2, and if they die and fossilize, they’re compacted into fossil fuels. Since we use those broken down fossil fuels as a source of energy to power vehicles, Its released into the atmosphere. When the suns energy comes in through the atmosphere, most is able to escape back into space once it reaches the earths surface, but some of that heat is held in by CO2 and other greenhouse gases (which has and is slowly heating up the atmosphere). So yes it does contribute to climate change, it’s just not too noticeable because 90% of that heat is absorbed by the ocean, and water expands when heated, plus the additional melting ice from the poles. It’s a threat, and a very real one, if we don’t find a way to slow the process it’s going to have some devastating impact.

Many people use it to join groups for and against and politicians use it to boost their campaign. Whenever something is being pushed as political propaganda it automatically turns on a skepticism in some people.<br /><br />B. Most people talking about Climate Change are only talking to themselves or other believers. Explanations are usually worded in a way to make the non believers seem like stupid cavemen or devolves into name calling. People being called names and made fun of instantly become defensive and dig deeper in their beliefs. This video here is another example. See how the cartoon character of the guy that was questioning the facts was made to be a complete moron. Also he was characterized to be an extreme conspiracy crazy instead of just a person searching for answers. Stop making fun of people if you want to ACTUALLY try and get them to see your side of things.	UClCLQLHzljhnXztbBs5lk9g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UClCLQLHzljhnXztbBs5lk9g	0

Last time I checked animal agriculture was the leading cause of green-house gas emissions, even more than the entire transportation system combined. And plant-based diets have been proven healthy for all stages of life, from pregnancy through adulthood. Also even eating plant-based I eat pizza and cookies and doughnuts and burgers, just plant-based versions of the same food I've always loved. Literally just eating plants instead of animal products is the single biggest thin an individual can do for this problem. But definitely doing more than one thing is great!

The Greenhouse effect is a misnomer it relies on darker noxious fumes to work, CO2 by itself does nothing. You should call it the shroud of doom theory but I don't want to give you ideas. The CO2 is heavy gas and fall into the sea for absorption. The atmosphere is only 0.004% CO2 (insignificant) but beneficial to plants. Venus' atmospheric problems come from high pressure and an over-active core, the opposite is true of Mars. This was not discovered by the indoctrinated NASA types but an independent boy genius, the core is leaking hydrogen and that is observable. Perhaps the next volcanic eruption will bake the earth but I doubt it.	UCrG5KQg4VztMLERT417MpGQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrG5KQg4VztMLERT417MpGQ	1	Ugghj0Gy-xqbyXgCoAEC	Mctittles

As a matter of fact I studied geography myself and did some work on this subjekt. So I found out myself, which is a huge part of teaching science. Knowlegde is not just fed like in churches, its constantly proven and reresearched. An easier way of finding out would be looking at Venus. Its very obvious what venus´s atmosphere is made of (much more CO2 than our) and the effects are that it is way hotter on its surfice than on mercury, which is way closer to the sun. The probability I talked about was the counterpart of the probability that nearly all scientist are wrong about this. There is not much calculation beeing done here. So based on your comments, I can clearly see that you are not a person of scientific background. This conversation ends here for me and I recommend you reading a propper book or something.

Humanity's effect on Climate can not be certain there is no proof at all for this. This is a clear attempt to centralise capital and slow 1st world development. As you know and ignore, Chaos theory means even a small change can have an enormous effect, a large change will usually have an immediate effect, the climate is no that erratic so it could be self-regulating, the likelihood of anything is not knowable in a chaotic system.

How can you calculate probability in a chaotic system? There is no method of doing this. The margin of error in approximations can mean catastrophic or insignifigant very easily. These core samples record periods of freezing or growth and not age. They are agin approximations. The models discount the medieval and roman warm periods as well as viking.

But this prediction is a matter of probability. Geologists studied ice shelfs, very old trees and segments to know pretty well what was going on. And given the recent development in our climate, we can predict with a very strong certainty (>99%), where our climate is going within the next century. I´m talking about the direction here. The magnitute of the climate change has a range in that prediction, but 2 things are certain. It is getting warmer, and we humans are the main factor causing it. There is no reasonable doubt about that in the scientific community, so to doubt it is just a matter of ignorance or intellectual dishonesty.

One simple solution I can come up with is genocide. The avarage temperature was increasing in the same pace as we humans multiplied. More people, more households, more garbage, more co2. Start a world war and the numbers will drop drastically. Unless you start selling your pc, car, phone, everything and start eating grass there won't be a better solution.

I studied philosophy.<br />As such, I don&#39;t feel qualified to personally understand what the causes of climate change are.<br />I do however have a decent amount of friends who are engineers, and I have seen the types of alternative energies there are available.<br />My opinion is; regardless of whether or not the use of fossil fuel and coal are causing the climate problems we see today; we should be using cleaner, safer, cheaper energy, even if our irresponsible use of resources has nothing to do with our environment changing.<br />Arguing about the cause of climate change makes no difference.

UgheNH_YH9Dz_ngCoAEC.87MLi07CHSl8TGmzM5zLu6		1	2017-06-01 15:03:41	mens sana	+Facey Neck I beg to differ, arguing about the cause of climate change is very important. That climate change happens, and that it is caused by humans, are two different things that have been proven separately. Yet the latter needs to be discussed as much as the former. Because it is our doing, it reflects our sense of accountability (or lack thereof). The question isn't only : "how to resolve the current situation ?" But more generally : "how do we learn from this and make sure that our actions, current and future, don't generate similar situations ?" In short, the deeper problem is the incapacity of our production system to think on the bigger scale. For example... When evaluating the benefits of fossil fuel exploitation, if the cost of its consequences over the next centuries was added, we would stop it immediately. It is not even profitable in the long run. Yet we won't stop because we ignore this kind of cost. That's why a green revolution can't happen merely by changing energy sources. Of course it needs to be encouraged. But as long as our industry doesn't include a larger and more scientific way of evaluating what a benefit is, we can reasonably doubt that future solutions won't create bigger problems.

It's true I'm not an expert in "climate science," as you phrased it. It's also true that fossil fuels are antiquated. Nothing odd about that.

That is true, but once again I don't see why you're pointing these things out. You've essentially agreed with what I said in my original comment, but in a very negative tone.

You as a person of science should know more than anyone that analysing different points of view for solving a problem may be the key to find a solution. And the problem may not be your idea but maybe your communication skills, did you ever considered that? Those politicians are just a burden for the society. Some serious accountability is needed to limit the power of those in charge. Also we need problem solving minds like the ones found in mathematicians or engineers, just like Sergio Fajardo, you should google him, he is a mathematician that became mayor of the city of Medellin in Colombia. He truly turned the system upside down and solve many issues in that city. Problem solving minds, that's what we need.

Obama was charismatic and all the doors were open to him. Trump is a very charismatic guy, but quite rude, and is getting lots of support. You might be rude but you certainly lack charisma, that social skill I'm talking about, and you certainly need some friendly-ness. Overall you sound pretty upset with the world.

I stated I already went to the Venture Capital boot camps and talked with people all with a nice tie and suit and very sweet and proper.  The fact is certain agendas only need apply.  My solution allows Carbon fuels to be used and phased out over time to about 80-95% of the time.  The religion is zero carbon and they are extremist "con men" who want only electric solutions.  These extremists include Bill Gates, Google's Eric Schmidt, the EPA, Department of Energy, NSF, DARPA, NASA and a laundry list of thugs who ain't got a clue.  They steal from tax payers and give it to their agenda driven friends.  Theft is what they do.  I even have a brother-in-law who works in DC who gives approval of NSF grants.  Nope, my solution is not allowed, even though it is the best and can be phased in very quickly and without trillions of investments, most of which come from slave labor camps in China. Which brings me to my point.  If what I am saying were true, you would be a fool not to call me on it, if of course, you are not a con-man yourself.  What I say is just physics and good engineering.  I put the interested party under contract and we step into it with penalty.  I am protected and so are they.  No can-man would do this you idiot.

Science is not assumption as fact.  You must prove it.  5.25 lnC/Co is assumed.  0.6 C per 100 PPm is assumed.  All just fraud and has nothing to do with science.   The hair on the tail of the dog does not wag the dog. 5% of the CO2 is assumed to control the entire climate.  Such stupidity is amazing beyond belief.  Anything for more taxes. Water concentrations go up and down by 400% all the time.  It the greenhouse effect is 33 C, with water 99%, then why don't we see 4 times 33 degrees effect when it goes from 1% to 4% water concentrations?  Simple, because all that happens is the height to extinction decreases. Not hard to understand.  Once it is saturated, more does nothing.  That height for water is 1-4 ft.   No more heating is possible. Where did they get the 33C in the first place? You guessed it, another assumption.  Do you know why glowball cooling was in vogue in the 1970's?  Because it depends on the assumptions and the data set.  This is NOT science.  They assume the conclusion they want.  Anybody can choose another data period and get cooling, no change, or warming, which shows the theory is wrong,.  Such is just fraud. As for giving a paper, why?  This is basic stuff.  It was proven 100 years ago.  Look it up yourself.  If such a paper as you cited were to be published, do you think I have any confidence in the views of other idiots?  NO!  There is little to no science in this field.  Science is not consensus.  Politics is.  Even the "deniers" get it wrong.  Why do you think there are 1.5 billion Muslims?  Do the numbers of idiots prove Allah and Mo are true?  No!  It just proves that a sword is a powerful persuader.  Believe or die.  The same with Climate change fraud.  Want money to do research?  You better prove it true or you are out of a job.

More CO2 doesn't absorb more energy from space as most is already trapped by the CO2 in the greenhouse effect. But it does prevent the same energy from reflecting back out to space. Aslong as the flow of heat is the same into our atmospher as it is out, the atmosphere doesn't warm. But when it is prevented from escaping, then we end up with similar conditions as Venus (not nearly as drastic, but same concept). A planet 2nd from the sun but much warmer than Mercury, which is closest to the sun. However the higher pressure of gases and sulfuric acid clouds also contributes to Venus's temperature, as it prevents heat from venting back out from the atmosphere. The upper atmospher absorbs most of the solar radiation, while the lower atmospher holds radiation that reflects off the surface of a planet allowing it to build up. And i'm glad to have a reasonable conversation with someone on youtube. Allthough we might not agree with eachother. You seem very knowledgable and we havn't resorted to calling eachother names. I never knew about any lagging effect on the temperature due to CO2 before, i've heard about it with Ozone. I'm still pretty set in my way that CO2 directly and indirectly causes the heating of the atmosphere. I've read allot about the effects of CO2 and Methane on the atmosphere, but my knowledge is limited when dealing with Ozone, water vapour and CFC's(I know they effect the Ozone layer, but don't know about their greenhouse effect). I was just wondering what you think has causes such a change in Global average temperatures and climate, if its not CO2 or Methane? I understant there could be hundreds of factors, probibly mostly human driven, but always understood Carbon and molecules associated with it was the main driving force.

Not much point in trying to tax clouds, not just because they can't pay, but because they play a neccisary roll in the climate. Just like how animals + fungi fart/breath out methane and CO2, and plants and bacteria convert said gasses back into Oxygen while making monosaccharides with the influence of UV radiation from the sun. This constantly occuring reaction (aka, photosynthesis) sustains life and climate on our planet. If plants + Bacteria can't keep up with Carbon(because of an increase of emmisions and/or a lack of plants), it accumulates in the atmosphere, heating the planet, to eventually be absorbed by the ocean, causeing an increase in acidity partly responsible (next to dumping waste into Oceans) for high pH loving algal plums exploding in population, and dissolving crustacians shells because they are made of Calcium Carbonate, which readily dissolves in an acidic enviernment. The opposite would likely cool the planet down. Even if there was no warming effects(which there is), it would be worth going "green" to improve our air quality(Beijing) and save our oceans, and even with no warming effect, we know that drastically changing the atmospheric composition destableizes the planets climate, whether warm or cold.  I would agree that in the western world we are over taxed for our services, and that E-testing is a huge money grab when a hummer can pass but a seddan can't based purely off of what come out of the tail pipe and not mileage. Proper management of resources is important. To suspect that people who invest in green energy are part of a huge conspiracy is idiodic(maybe they do pay to exagerate some statistics, but they wouldn't need to alter them much). Especially when Oil companies have been busted covering up the harmful effects of lead, contaminating local ground waters with fracking, and the fact that Exxon was just in the supreme court for covering up climate data. BP and Chevron themselves awknowleges the existence of man made climate change. Why the heck would clouds cause a long lasting trend of climate change and warming. Did you know that warmer air holds more water than colder air. So there couldn't even be an increase of water vapour in the atmosphere without an increase in temperature or atleast Carbon, as it can form 4 bonds with other atoms and Oxygen can only form 2. Could you please explain the cause and effect of you claims? You may be an amazing engineer, and great at Physics (my weak subject) but I think your knowlege is lacking in Chemistry and Biology. Maybe going off of hearsay or opinion more than evidence, data, observations, and cause and effect. I don't often hear Chemists or Meteorologists lecture about Engineering matters, so I don't know why the opposite is happening. The cause, effect and reasons of climate change and even Ozone depleation are covered usually in introduction to grade 10 chemistry classes (at least in Canada). Its because its not hard for a kid to understand and can be shown through small scale expiriments and large scale examples in life. Example, have you ever driven into a city to see a low hanging cloud of smog covering the place, to find the city is much more warmer than the surrounding areas, regardless of if they're more north or south? Or lived near the city to see said cloud blow in and cause a temperature increase at midnight? (yes warm airfronts exist, but had you been in the wind prior to it passing through the city, you would find a less drastic increase in temp, and less stinky air). Researchers in Antarctica have to apply sun screen while wareing winter cloathers, because the amount of harmful UV rays reaching the surface can cause sunburn to exposed skin. Gas Law PV=nRT Pressure(P) and volume(V) is equal to the number of moles of a gas(n), multiplied by a constant(R=), and the temperature(T) Last year texas got snow, year before Egypt got snow for the 1st time in over 100 years. this year Ontario didn't get snow until after christmas. Same time last year it was -25'C. And for a while there, Alaska was warmer than here. Might not be an easy answer of heating up or cooling down for some people. In reality, its unstability thats the concern. "I have studied very well into my subject of Biochemistry, and it is in my opinion, therefore fact, that combstion doesn't cause a cars tires to move, gravety and wind does. Everyone else is just arrogent. My weather man can support these claims too. People just need to wake up and stop ignoring my unprovable facts"	UCIzIEQGkDsbVKR6YeTXIolw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIzIEQGkDsbVKR6YeTXIolw	1	UgheNH_YH9Dz_ngCoAEC	Facey Neck

No, it is not like that because I put oil in my car and understand why.  I think, therefore you analogy is silly. Majority of Scientists?  Sorry that 97% is really 1% who are well connected. God in a cloud?  No, straw-men are not valid in science. Pope is not a scientist, nor the vicar of Christ. Can they get more heat in a green house when they supplement?   The height to extinction of CO2 at 380 ppm is about 10 meters or 32 ft.  So adding more CO2 in a greenhouse with a roof below 32ft will allow for saturation and increase the warming a little. But the atmosphere is NOT a greenhouse.  Adding more water does nothing because the height is 1-4 ft and is saturated. Any honest scientist will admit we know next to nothing about climate and how it works.  All we do know is that CO2 is not the cause.  Even Gore's graph he used a ladder with shows you this.  CO2 lags temperature and therefore cannot be the cause.  Wake up. I am an engineer.  My have studied is well.  Your arrogance is only exceeded by your ignorance.  Stop ignoring the truth that CO2 is not the driver of climate and has zero to do with it.  Clouds do have a big part, yet we don't want to tax clouds do we?  Are we going to tax water vapor?  Why not?  Because people would finally wake up and toss the bums out.

But what qualifies you to go against the entire respected scientific community by claiming AGW is false. That's like me going against my mechanic for saying if I don't put oil in my car engine it will seize up. It's like denying what he says until I can see it for myself, then blaming it on my car battery. But you claiming a vast majority of science as a religion makes me suspect that you think god is on a cloud smiling down at you at all times because he put oil in the ground for you to burn in your car and would never let anything he didn't want happen. But everything he didn't want to happen is caused by a devil who corrupts scientists into studying gene splicing and stem cells. By the way, the pope acknowledges climate change and evolution now(not saying he's not corrupt). ONE QUESTION I HAVE, IF CO2 DOESN'T EFFECT TEMPERATURE, HOW COME PEOPLE CAN GET MORE HEAT IN A GREEN HOUSE WHEN THEY SUPPLEMENT CO2 INTO GREEN HOUSES? Is god making every greenhouse with more CO2 warmer while hiding dinosaur bones in the ground? Or can you just look on a periodic table of elements to see that the heat and radiation retention of Carbon is higher than that of Oxygen, test it for your self, find there's no exceptions, and move on?  Science is never conclusive, but the only thing being debated in the scientific community now is if climate change is caused all by humans, or just mostly. The only debate happening is in politics, and we know those people are usually the last to be honest and the 1st to accept bribes. It doesn't take allot of thought to study both sides, find what is and isn't a good source of information, and to study how these massive systems (Climate, Ozone Layer, El Nino, Arctic Cyclone, Atmosphere) and things work, to understand how they can be affected. Even though there still being studied we know allot about how they work. Anyways, I don't see a point in arguing this nor do I have the time. So I will not be responding. But I encourage you to talk to anyone who has studied Chemistry, Physics, Biology, Statistics, the natural history of Earth, Find out their standing with the rest of the world's scientific community, and hear what they have to say about the AGW theory.

UgheNH_YH9Dz_ngCoAEC.87MLi07CHSl898ylLx-GlN		3	2016-01-18 11:44:49	Rusty Shackleford	+Facey Neck In my experience, electric vehicles work great in construction and resource gathering because the engines and air intake won't get plugged with dust and debris. They also start better than diesels in the cold weather and some can be charged with solar panel when your not working. They won't explode or overheat as much either. I think we'll see a jump to Biofuel before we go completely electric though. Due to how quick it would be to convert some cars, and their abundance and efficiency. We're almost there though. Batteries just need to become better. I imagine in my life I'll see a day where each household gathers enough electricity to meet their needs and even grow enough food as well. That will be great for the planet, the infrastructure and for self-reliance. Imagine a day where you don't need a home connected to roads because you can fly out there with a personal vehicle, and that the same place was completely off the grid. There could be a nuclear war and you wouldn't be affected. Cleaner burning emissions has made modern cars less efficient in their fuel consumption. Seems like it's a trade that doesn't really do much in the end. Electric machinery, a shrinking population, and the ability to grow meat in a factory is what's going to save our planet.

If we had traffic rule in cell phone where you could not download past a certain speed even though you were safe, how long do you think Apple would be in business?  Not long.  But do you idiots think of what laws do?  NEVER!!!! Who says what projects are right?  The government thug?  They have government jobs because they are stupid.  Do you think private enterprise will decided?   Most money from that fraud tax will be giving to more thugs who live in palaces, like Gore.  If you want to solve the problem, then solve the problem.  Get some knowledge like I have.  Stop trying to extort money out of people with the CO2 fraud.  Just solve the problem. Ok???  Can you get your arrogant pea brain around that?  Gore has NO clue, yet people listen to this idiot.  Why?  Because the government is about thuggery and they might get a piece of the booty (theft tax).  Like a bunch of thug Muslims out for sex slaves and theft. Worked for Mohammad, who not the NWO.  Yah sure, just rob me.  Go right ahead.  Screw my rear while you are at it... Try creating and stop taking that which is not yours.  Got ii?  Good.

And yes, this is quite easy to solve with a little capital... Look, for the small amount of 4-5 people helping me I can get this done.  That is less than the salary of the "dead wood" in a department in any Air Force base. If they (4-5 people) could all work without salary it would cost less than $100,000-$200,000 to get parts made in 1-10 part quantities.  There is no new materials needed.  I just need to speed it up.  I have the cash to get it done, but it would take me 10-15 years all by myself.  Can't you see what I am saying???  For a drop in a swimming pool of savings (1.5-2 trillion per year when fully implemented)  we could solve this problem, yet people like you complain, call me stupid, and whine for more taxes to give to your ignorant friends (solyndra....remember that fraud???) )who don't have a clue....  For the cash in Hillary Clinton's campaign account, or what Jeb Bush has wasted,  I could deliver a 300 mpg car with that engine in it ready to produce....that can FLY, for crying out loud...  Can you think?  Can't you just shut up until you put up your OWN MONEY where you big fat AGW mouth is and realize that until you risk your OWN cash, like I am, you will never sober up to the right solutions.  We spend billions on battery nonsense and my system can recover energy without that stupid battery.  What a waste....  Just look at the GM Volt...  I don't have the life cycle issue that all known batteries have, yet you won't listen, and I am the stupid one.  You deserve to have your rear taxed into poverty and your life controlled by some dictator via this fraud CO2 tax.  Just leave me out of it. OK?  Wake up. Again, put your own money up or shut up... Go out and solve the problem yourself if you don't like my solution.

They show proof of funds and ability to help.  We give a general outline of what is needed, with various parts to the system, but again, not exactly how it is done.  They accept or reject.  3) We then set up the proper entity to make the investments and terms of the use of funds, along with times, goals, etc.  4) Investments are funded, purchased, turned around and cash flow achieved. 5)  Money is returned  when the bank refinances the underlying money invested out.  Investor has no money in the project and is paid an amount for the loan as negotiated. 6) Money goes to entity (not my pocket) and employees are found to accelerate the R&D of the systems, which includes designers, Mech engineers, sub contractors, machinists and general help.  Independent accountants controls the cash flow from the investments to the entity. We locate a small place to work and then get it done.  Again, the original investor has all their money back.  What they hold is a negotiated right to the technology at a price. 7)  Engine is run, tested, and installed in a house for several months, then apartments and then later commercial.  All the disconnects are UL listed so it is a stand alone box with disconnects so as to avoid UL listing (very costly) at this phase.  Since we own the properties, UL listing can be avoided.  UL listing is needed when offered to the public...we avoid this process until much later when cash flow is easy.  7) Test, iterate, solve problems and improve.  Validate.  Test for 40,000 hrs.  Etc. 8)  Install in various vehicles .... 9)  Acquire more investments, turn around, install in buildings and grow ASAP.  Take on new investors and partners with limited rights. 10) Get the product ready for general sale 11) Go into various markets, such as cars, boats, and sell to commercial and apartments.... $billions. I already have a valid concept for a new car and roadable airplane that the DOT of my State has approved for operation on the roads as described.  That engine goes into that vehicle.  It has the needed crash protection. So, Clearly what I am saying is very valid and doable.  It is based on classical thermodynamic and Mechanical engineering found in any text book. So, again, put up or shut up.

(Wells Fargo already agrees to this and will back money out if the engine makes money and increases NOI).  I keep it a "black box" that nobody knows how it works. I get the data needed to prove it. Once it works and makes money, I buy more real estate and put the engine in those assets and back out the money via banks. The bank becomes the source of funding, not venture capital.  I don't need venture capital, unlike Apple or some Computer company because my technology can increase the value of a building by 60% in CA and 30% in low utility states.  A 100 billion dollar business can be made without anybody knowing anything about it openly, all funded by low interest rate bank loans and not expensive 50% interest rate venture capital. Once it is proven we file for patents.  This then saves 7-10 years on the use of the patents vs option 1 where the clock is ticking and industry just black ball me.  No company like GM, Ford or Toyota or GE will want to pay royalties.  Once it is know to work they will figure out a way around the patents or outright copy it.  This is very "disruptive" technology and will not be taken lightly. So, stupid people take option 1.  Smart people can see that option 2 is the way to go. So far I have not met people who can see the massive superiority of option 2.   All they think about is making quick money.  They can't see the big picture.  This is 10 times cell phones, not some latest app to watch your favorite slut with. As far as what people think of me?  Don't care.  I deal in facts, not beliefs.  If you can't see what I am after then I take it you are not someone I want to work with.  Like I said, put up or shut up. 	UC74BjyNQbPtNFF52U5EvIdg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC74BjyNQbPtNFF52U5EvIdg	1	UgheNH_YH9Dz_ngCoAEC	Facey Neck

I use my cash for fix ups. We do it all in contract.  They get first position on real estate I find at 25-50% of value as security.  I use the $5 mil over 2-3 years to get the needed residual cash flow (400K/year) to hire additional help.  All the income from the real estate goes to the development and nothing to me.  I fund myself like I have been doing since 1995.  I then give them back the $5 million via loans from major banks with some interest for their trouble. Wells Fargo is already good to go... I use the cash flow to hire people, pay for prototypes and to do the engineering of the systems.  No money goes to me.  I work for free.  I install the engines in apartments and commercial buildings and in a few cars.  Test for 40,000 hrs, and work out bugs.  What they get is rights to production in one line of product,  as negotiated, or some portion of the real estate appreciation, as negotiated.  Each engine is worth about $60,000-140,000 depending on Utility rates. Cost should be around $10,000 or less. They don't own the company. Only a right to production.  It is like a right to Windows for a certain area.   Sorry.  What I get is an engine that can go into most cars, airplanes, trucks, houses, and commercial building.  I have the key to the auto and light aircraft industry where cars can get 300 mpg and fly as well as hit the wall at 75 mpg under 1000 HIC.  (yes I have done crash tests before....).  This solves your problem of CO2.   Little need for Oil...  I get an airplane/car that I want.  No carbon tax needed.  No more need for $2 billion/year in research on CO2 Greenhouse nonsense. As I said, put up or shut up. 	UC74BjyNQbPtNFF52U5EvIdg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC74BjyNQbPtNFF52U5EvIdg	1	UgheNH_YH9Dz_ngCoAEC	Facey Neck
UgheNH_YH9Dz_ngCoAEC.87MLi07CHSl88VJVkTQ_l_		1	2016-01-02 07:26:41	seaplaneguy	@Facey Neck   Did I say electrical motor need to be 100%?  No.  But you just claimed I did.  Off grid?  Proof of concept?  Hardly.  They just transferred carbon use, they did not lower it.  Spending a lot of energy to make panels and then claiming you are zero carbon is foolish.  A Prius uses 3 times as much carbon as a Jeep Wrangler, mine to recycle.  A Jeep for cry out loud! Total carbon use is the measure, not some "off grid" nonsense that costs more to generate than had you used coal. I simply stated my system could get 80-90% of the fuel gone. You don't know anything about what I have, yet you make claim about something it without any facts. Need I say more? I'm sure you think you know a lot, if not all.  I really don't care if you or I know a lot.  I only need to know what I want to do and how to find out what I don't know. Implement ideas on You tube?  Was I doing that?  Am I after a "revolution" of technology?  No, I am after technology that I think will work.  Maybe other people might find my work useful when it is shown to work.  League?  Not doing sports.  I am doing engineering.  I can care less what others are doing if mine works.  I can use it in my investments and make 110-220% / year returns based on current prices.  I don't need to sell it to anybody as the value is had via real estate. You can't do this with current solar panels as the cost is much too high and the returns are zero or negative. This technology can go from 0 to 100's of billion of dollars without direct external funding or venture capital.  I just need to get some help to speed up the process.  That means doing more real estate investments that fund the R&D, that can use the technology.  It will take around 5-7 years to complete a full cycle to demonstrate life cycle. So, again, but up or shut up...  	UC74BjyNQbPtNFF52U5EvIdg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC74BjyNQbPtNFF52U5EvIdg	1	UgheNH_YH9Dz_ngCoAEC	Facey Neck

Your pompous attitude, and hubristic assumption as me being an uneducated idiot is all I need to know about what kind of person you are. I said nothing that merited the smart-assed comment you initially made to mine. Nothing whatever. Then you start off our exchange assuming that I don't know what I'm talking about. Which is patently false, but I have no need to prove what I know to you just because you don't believe me. You lack proper 'hard core' logic and intelligence. I grazed over your last comment. Fucking pathetic man. Electric vehicles don't need to be 100% efficient to change the world. It's called 'gradual implementation' for a reason, and it's a starting point. Politics is #1 hurdle in anything, requiring gradual transformation of technology, which should be so fucking tacit and obvious it wouldn't merit me typing it out to you. This line of thinking is part of "Things Obivous to Anyone of High Intelligence 101," but you can't teach intelligence. There are 100% off-the-grid homes. That's proof of concept. You can work everything else out in reverse from there, you know, if you're like, smart and stuff. (...but you aren't.) If you were really as intelligent as you seem to THINK you are, you'd know that your fed-up interlocutor is as smart as they come, just by the screed you see before you. INSTEAD, you just assume I couldn't possibly know anything, because it seems to contradict what you're sure you know. You can't implement your ideas clearly in a YouTube post. Why would anyone think that you could actually implement a technological revolution? Too much "LOL" here for one person to take, dude. You're out of your league.

An electric car is designed with 200 mile range because the stinking battery weights 400-600 lbs per gallon equiv..  Natural Gas weighs 12 lbs/gallon with the tank. Do the math.  Electric motors are really only 60% efficient.  My new engine will be that with the conversion on board, meaning I get climate control for free via the cycle. Your piece of junk e car needs to run another cycle to cool the car.  Try running that Tesla junk in Alaska or anywhere where it is cold or hot.  Forget it.  My technology will be twice as good in range when it is hot or cold.  Fact....  Make work causes CO2.  It does not help your religion.  Your smart engineer friends have no clue.  Find one.  Get him on here and I will debate it. As for CO2, the AGW theory is false, absurd and shows how stupid the smart guys are.	UC74BjyNQbPtNFF52U5EvIdg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC74BjyNQbPtNFF52U5EvIdg	1	UgheNH_YH9Dz_ngCoAEC	Facey Neck

Otherwise keep the clapper shut..." ...now you're saying: "Not scared of spread of true information.  Just get the facts right before you open your mouth, that's all." Do you see how you're changing your words? You EXPLICITLY, in NO uncertain terms, told me to stop talking about cleaner sources of energy. Now, you're saying, 'Well uh... I mean, just make sure your facts are in order.' Shut up dude! I'm not gonna get into a debate with someone who changes their stance on something as simple as 'shut-the-fuck-up' in one fucking post. If you know how to revolutionize the world with clean energy; great. Go do that. At the moment you're trying to argue with me about what constitutes viable energy sources, and stroking your own ego. Neither of which is going to do anything good. The point of my original post should be obvious: whether or not the climate is changing due to human activity, the primitive energy sources we're using are outdated and there are much better options. I will leave you with this though: No, you cannot currently drive over 600 miles on one single electric charge. So fucking what? EV's were never intended for long-distance travel. Doesn't matter in the slightest though, because electric vehicles could be implemented and altered in most people's cars, as the overwhelming majority of people do not need to drive more than 200 miles in a given day. Leave the fossil fuels to the large transportation vehicles that need to do that. That's one of a countless other number of safe, easy, JOB-CREATING solutions that you're trying to not look at. And I know you're trying to be a dick about it, because you suggested that I didn't know what I was talking about, and then you suggest that I don't know the limitations of electric transportation, which I am very well aware of. Once again; I have a lot of smart engineer friends. Move along sir.	UC-7tLqiCdUkyPZrzMIU7bKQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-7tLqiCdUkyPZrzMIU7bKQ	1	UgheNH_YH9Dz_ngCoAEC	Facey Neck

Actually, there are no viable "alternative fuels" that works in current systems.  Wake up.  A fuel is only good with a certain piece of equipment.  For example, NG takes too much space to be viable for current cars with the limited stations.  If you triple the range you can get to the needed range per volume if there were enough stations.  Normally you need more range for alternative fuel, not less.  This is why electric cars don't work.  The range needs to be 2 x just to compete.  Try getting 600-1000 miles on an electric car..  But you knew that, right?

You seem to be _explicitly_ saying that unless I have the means, time AND education to put into use sources of energy that will improve the globe, I should censor myself from speaking about them? Why are you so insecure about the spread of information? Could it be because what you propose is preposterous and you fear competition? Your proposal is extraordinary. Extraordinary claims require greater than or equal to extraordinary evidence for them to have weight. Your comment was essentially a lot of huffing-and-puffing without substance of any sort. Literally a blow-hard. The alternatives to fossil fuel are well known and proven. If you really are educated on the matter to a point where your claim could be implemented, you would know this. Holy fuck. Regardless of what I type on YouTube, there will always be simpletons trying to look like the next Messiah.

The fact is you can improve the efficiency of cars, houses and such, but not with the solar panels, windmills and nonsense Al your pal Gore has. Want to get 80-90-% of the CO2 out of your life. Write me, let's have a chat. I have a plan. Send me $5 million and I will do the R&D to get the first prototype done. That is cheap...Bill Gates is up to $200 million with ecomotors.com and nothing to show for it.... It will lead to 300 mpg cars that can hit a wall at 70 mph. That same car can power your house.

For me its always been simple to argue we all want clean water air yada yada. But i live in the country where the neighboring lands holds a golf course and gmo farm fields. Both i know will use heavy nitrates, clear more land, and spray pesticides. what should i do? On the one hand i dont want them to spray or to clear cut too close to the river but on the other if their fields fail or the grass goes brown we lose a valuable asset to the community that boost my property value. The long vision says screw them as what do they matter if they earth is a fiery hell whole. The short says screw me. Screw them. Screw us all. We need to learn to live differently or else. Problem is. We believe and rightly so that others wont say screw me for the future. They willl say screw you and keep plugin. So i will get screwed on the short and the long and screw that. If you can create a system that economically bubbles those making the right long vision choice so that the others done screw them, then and only then will a fair choice be present.

The reason they picked C02 for their platform is that there are so few scientist that can disprove it. Sulphur dioxide and nitrous oxide to name a couple from fossil fuels but can be overcome with technology and cost, Plastic in the oceans, Land clearing and we could go on. I am all for renewables though we will need nuclear or fossils for base loads or when a volcano like Tambora erupts again cause that will cut out the 2 Billion acres of solar panels for power for 3 years.

Heed this, when at the end of an interglacial and the earth is cooling by moving away from the sun C02 is still rising (ppm) for 1000 years but the earth still cools, your experts have no answer for this either. Try and listen to unfunded atmospheric physicists (the next step up from a climatologists) and if you read the IPCC report instead of listening to the alarmist media you will find out that there is not much other than the POSSIBILITY of C02 warming.

UgjTaFXoTY7XyHgCoAEC.8H2WwFYWSFT8tyao16dZK3		0	2019-04-21 02:50:44	Rod Martin, Jr.	@Mr Phwibbs From our current levels of CO2 and warmth, massive increases in both are indicated as desirable. Let me take your points, one-by-one. *_RATE OF INCREASE_* You said, "The rate at which CO2 and temperature has been rising has never been seen before in earths climate..." For CO2, and the planet as a whole, you would be right. To my knowledge, at no time in Earth's long history has CO2 jumped as quickly as it has in the last 70 years. But anyone entering a submarine or a crowded meeting hall after an hour or two of conference, will have experienced extreme rates of increase that make the worldwide increase look like a turtle swimming through cold molasses. One video I watched recently of climate skeptics included a crusty old curmudgeon on-stage holding a CO2 meter registering 8900 ppm. Anyone walking into that room would go from 400 to 8900 in the time it takes to gulp in another breath of air. No ill effects! Farmers are forever filling their greenhouses with CO2 to make their plants grow bigger and produce plumper. That's increases to 1200 ppm within minutes or hours, instead of centuries. Only positive effects. Warming rates _have_ been far faster in the past with wonderful effects, overall. Not all locations experience the same benefits, but more locations have benefits than do not. 20th century Warming: +0.9C/century (21st century has slowed down from this rate, almost flat) 1817-1818 AD Warming: +50C/century for 2 years after 1816 year without a summer (approximation) 9620-9610 BC Warming: +100C/century for 10 years after end of Younger Dryas "Big Freeze" (est. by some scientists) Read my book *_Climate Basics: Nothing to Fear_* for more information and sources. *_DESERTS AND DROUGHTS_* You said, "Although it isn't wrong that plants will benefit from more CO2, they won't from desertification and droughts caused by global warming." On this point, you have things completely backwards. You have to ask yourself how land ever gets water in the first place. If you cool the planet, you get far, far less rain -- and more deserts! In fact, during the last glacial period, as much as 70% of all land surface was either desert or semi-desert. All that ice covering North America and Europe was desert! If you study paleoclimate, you find in the literature (even in rinkydink Wikipedia) references to massive amounts of drying out or desiccation during the 50 million years of cooling to our current Ice Age. Earth was far, far wetter during the Eocene -- a veritable garden from pole to pole, and deserts far smaller, but also drier in their interiors. Read my book *_Deserts & Droughts_* for more information and sources. *_OCEAN ACIDIFICATION_* Did you know that some unscrupulous scientists used a different acid to determine that pH changes from CO2 would destroy life in the oceans? Did you know that CO2 does *_not_* produce the same effects? Did you know that shellfish shells are *_not_* in any danger from an alkaline ocean or even a neutral ocean? And did you know that when shellfish first evolved those wonderful shells that atmospheric CO2 was in the range of 4,500-7,000 ppm? Read my book *_Red Line - Carbon Dioxide_* for more information and sources. *_NASA SMAC and CO2_* You must have looked at an earlier version. NASA SMAC vol.5, p.119, "RATIONALE FOR AN INCREASE IN THE 1-HOUR SMAC," says, "Mild headache and hyperventilation would be easily tolerated for 1 h, thus the 1-h SMAC is increased to 2%." And 2% = 20,000 ppm. If you don't already know, NASA is, of necessity, a conservative government agency. People there do not like to take big risks. So, the spacecraft maximums are very conservative and the difficulties are minor. If you look at their table 7.2, you'll see that other agencies are even more lenient than NASA. The most lenient is NIOSH (IDLH) with a brief maximum of 40,000 ppm. National Research Council (NRC) allows 25,000 for up to 24 hours! One plant study showed that rice and wheat grown under 20,000 ppm CO2 had roughly the same produce output as 400 ppm. So, it's relatively safe for crops, too. It would take us a very long time to reach that level. *_GLOBAL WARMING_* Your fear of warming is unwarranted. Climate changes all the time. We've had far faster warming in the past, as I've already discussed. And life does *_not_* wilt from even 11C of warming in a 24-hour period. That much happens in mild Los Angeles every day. The feard +3C is nothing by comparison. That leaves ecological changes to contend with. Every species on Earth can quickly adapt to far greater warming in minutes!!! I dare you to find any species that dies from warming of +5C from the daily ambient minimum. There are *_always_* changes to the environment. If we get +3C over the next century, a turtle could walk the 200 km to an equivalent temperature. That would take a few weeks, and the turtle could relax the remainder of that "scary" century, waiting for climate change to catch up with it. Read my book *_Thermophobia: Shining a Light on Global Warming_* for more information and sources. Hope this helps.

UgjTaFXoTY7XyHgCoAEC.8H2WwFYWSFT8txSd6JiOYW		1	2019-04-20 16:11:22	Mr Phwibbs	@Rod Martin, Jr. so what you're stuck up on is that more heat and CO2 isn't bad? Because that would be wrong. The rate at which CO2 and temperature has been rising has never been seen before in earths climate, this is because of human activity and the greenhouse effect. Although it isn't wrong that plants will benefit from more CO2, they won't from desertification and droughts caused by global warming. The reason why it all worked out in the past was because the changes took the time to let species adapt and evolve, that's not the case here. If we saw those levels of CO2 in the next 100 years there'd be immeasurable damage to pretty much all life. In addition, ocean acidification is pretty shitty and will kill off our phytoplankton responsible for the majority of photosynthesis of earth and we'll be on a downwards spiral of positive feedback loops. Also I looked into that NASA SMAC thing and your 20 000 ppm is actually 20 000 mg/m^3. Its more around 13 000 ppm, and they also specify at this concentration only an hour long exposure to this is safe before various symptoms kick in (hyperventilation, blurry vision). The longest exposure they considered was of around 180 days and the absolute maximum was of 7 000 ppm. A lifetime exposure would be even lower.

Climate has done nothing but change throughout the last 4.5 billion years. And the supposed problem: Catastrophic Anthropogenic (manmade) Global Warming (CAGW) doesn't exist. First of all, the tiny amount of warming we've experienced is NOT catastrophic, any more than sipping hot cocoa after freezing your butt off is dangerous. It's not manmade, because this is a natural, 1,000-year cycle warm period that showed up right on schedule and had nothing to do with CO2. So, there's nothing to "fix." We should celebrate the warming, because we currently live in an Ice Age.	UCuhhX9p8cfLJTP5m5lm6z6Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuhhX9p8cfLJTP5m5lm6z6Q	1	UgjTaFXoTY7XyHgCoAEC	Tardigrades

The warming of the 18th, 19th, 20th and 21st centuries has been a natural part of the 1,000-year cycle of warming and cooling that gave us the Modern Warm Period, right on schedule, and the most prosperous era in human history. *_And you guys are going ape-shxt complaining about it?_* We poison our environment with Monsanto glyphosate, Syngenta atrazine and other petrochemical toxins. CO2 is a vital gas of life at dangerously low levels. Check out my 99c book for the *_Climate Basics: Nothing to Fear._* The real danger is the speeding up of the Holocene cool down by idiots at Harvard and the United Nations. Dumb! Cold kills. Cold is why humanity couldn't start agriculture and civilization for the 90,000 years since the last, far warmer interglacial of *_the current Ice Age._*	UCuhhX9p8cfLJTP5m5lm6z6Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuhhX9p8cfLJTP5m5lm6z6Q	1	UgjTaFXoTY7XyHgCoAEC	Tardigrades

It will eventually go into another ice age, if not later than usual due to our actions; the concern is how we impact our current environment- will we be able to survive?

They wouldn't set it that high if 20,000 were dangerous. That's the start of minor difficulties. CO2 is a clean, clear odorless gas. All life on Earth would die without it.

UgjTaFXoTY7XyHgCoAEC.8H2WwFYWSFT8rH01_8woiZ		1	2019-02-13 02:11:19	neofilm	@Rod Martin, Jr. the only "utter nonsense" I see is your numbers. How about we try this without being rude. You say humans can take upwards of 20,000 ppm? Wouldn't you kill someone many times over with those levels? When CO2 reaches levels of "1000 to 2000 ppm, the air quality is low. From 2000 to 5000 ppm, CO2 concentration starts to cause problems (headaches, insomnia, nausea). It is a dirty air. From 5000 ppm, the presence of other gases in air is altered, arising a toxic atmosphere or poor in oxygen with fatal effects as the concentration increases." CO2 was at its highest before modern humans even existed, the highest I've seen are 4,000 ppm. "The last time there was this much (today's level of 400 ppm) carbon dioxide (CO2) in the Earth's atmosphere, modern humans didn't exist." You're safety level is a whopping 50 times that! Our current co2 levels are "the highest in the last 800,000 and possibly even the last 20 million years.” Modern human has only been around at best 315,000 years. So, current levels are something we've never experienced. At best i can only find that maybe, and this is maybe, the highest ppm C02 levels have been are about 4,000 ppm and this was 500 million years ago before perhaps evidence of terrestrial life even beginning to emerge. But in the most recent hundreds of thousands to millions of years CO2 has been as low as 180 ppm. Also, we are exponentially pushing more into the atmosphere everyday on top of every molecule already there that CAN LAST HUNDREDS OF YEARS. "When CO2 levels were higher in the past, solar levels were also lower. " CO2 emissions we're talking about in this day and time are not occurring in balance with nature. Sciencing says it nice stating in the natural state of things "a delicate balance exists between carbon dioxide and other gases. The concern over carbon dioxide is the significant change over a relatively short period of time." According to a recent article in sciencing "Carbon dioxide emissions impact human health by displacing oxygen in the atmosphere. Breathing becomes more difficult as carbon dioxide levels rise. In closed areas, high levels of carbon dioxide can lead to health complaints such as headaches. Carbon dioxide levels may indicate high levels of other harmful air pollutants such as volatile organic compounds which contribute to indoor air pollution." Then there's this: "A Stanford scientist has spelled out for the first time the direct links between increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and increases in human mortality" "the new study details how for each increase of 1 degree Celsius caused by carbon dioxide, the resulting air pollution would lead annually to about a thousand additional deaths and many more cases of respiratory illness and asthma in the United States" "The study is the first specifically to isolate carbon dioxide's effect from that of other global-warming agents and to find quantitatively that chemical and meteorological changes due to carbon dioxide itself increase mortality due to increased ozone, particles and carcinogens in the air."

Humans can take up to about 20,000 ppm and it only takes seconds to go from 400 to 20,000! We're adding CO2 to the atmosphere far too slowly to be a problem if 400 to 20,000 in seconds is *_not_* a problem. So your "adapt" argument is utter nonsense. CO2 in ocean isn't a problem, either. The shellfish alarmists complain might be damaged by 400 ppm don't tell you that shellfish evolved under skies with 4,500 to 7,000 ppm CO2. Other toxins? You're changing the subject.

When we pump so much CO2 in the atmosphere so fast we don't give life a chance to adapt. At least that's my take on it... Plus other toxins we pump into the environment. As a general rule why should we be so nasty if we don't have to be? And with CO2 as high as you make out the threshold to potentially be exactly how would we fare, sure plants might do well but what about other life forms?

The amount of warming from this one trace (tiny, tiny amount) is so small that it cannot be measured! And the amount of water vapor released from that immeasurable CO2 warming is vanishingly small -- perhaps enough to fill a bucket, but for a planet the size of Earth, that's nothing. So, no. I did address your point. Nothing + nothing = nothing! When CO2 can continue going up, as it has on numerous occasions for hundreds of years, while temperatures go down, it shows that CO2 is a very, very weak green house gas. When you look at Al Gore's graph in his "inconveniently wrong" film, you see a monstrous spike in CO2, but we've had no commensurate spike in temperature. Compared to the ups and downs over the last 650,000 years, the spike in temperature should've been +10C of warming, but we've barely had +1C, and that meager warming had already been planned by nature as part of the 1,000-year cycle of warming periods throughout the Holocene interglacial of the current Ice Age. Now, do you see why CO2 is a non-issue with warming? But worse for the warming alarmist side of the argument (and I used to be on that side), global warming is far, far, far better than global cooling at our current stage near the bottom of Earth's livable temperature range. History proves this, if you care to study it.	UCuhhX9p8cfLJTP5m5lm6z6Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuhhX9p8cfLJTP5m5lm6z6Q	1	UgjTaFXoTY7XyHgCoAEC	Tardigrades

We're damaging the environment with garbage, pesticides, herbicides, etc., but not with CO2. Our output of carbon dioxide is refreshing a deadly starvation level of the gas. Without CO2, all life on Earth dies. And at our current levels, plant life struggles. In fact, when CO2 levels got down to 800 ppm (2x today's level), plants worldwide freaked out enough to evolve C4 species. And warming in an Ice Age is a good thing. You certainly don't want those 2 "little" white things at the poles to get any bigger.

First of all, CO2, by empirical (observed) evidence, provides close to zero correlation with temperature. So, the greenhouse effect is either extremely wimpy or nonexistent. I'd vote for wimpy. If Al Gore was right in his Inconvenient video, then that sharp spike in CO2 should've generated a near-immediate sharp spike in temperature, but it didn't!!! No correlation; no possibility for causation. There are feedback loops in nature, but CO2 is such a tiny one (if it exists at all), it'd be like spitting in the ocean and expecting to measure sea level rise from your added saliva.

So, unprecedented it is *_not._* We stand now at the coldest of the 10 major warm periods of the Holocene. The 2nd coldest was the Medieval Warm Period, and it was warm enough for the Vikings to grow crops in Greenland for hundreds of years.

To claim that we should stop the climate from changing one bit is indeed ludicrous. To claim that when people say/write 'stop climate change' they mean precisely that, however, misrepresents the issue in a way that at best makes a joke of the view you're advancing, and at worst misleads others. As I've gathered, it seems that the issue is not that warming is itself bad- any geologist might happily point out that warming is not of itself a bad thing or a good thing. The issue is that we are having a clear and unprecedented impact on the rate of climate change, and that hastening toward a climate more like the one seen in the Eocene would cause unnecessary (or at the very least deferrable) world-wide suffering.

Everything the mainstream media says about "climate change" shows that it's bad; nothing ever good. If there were a good climate to have, we'd likely have to *_change_* to get there. And that makes the entire "climate change" is bad idea illogical and anti-science. What is the best climate for humanity and life? I'm sure there would be a great deal of disagreement on this. Before "climate change" became the big topic, it was "global warming is bad." But is it really? We live in an ongoing Ice Age, our Holocene is already overdue to end, based on average interglacial durations (Ref: W.S. Broecker, 1998). And history shows that civilizations have prospered during far warmer climates, but fell apart with famine during cooler climates. CO2 is a vital gas of life. We've been in short supply for millions of years. Nature is slowly sequestering CO2 toward Total Extinction. But humans interrupted that death spiral by burning fossil fuels. *_150 ppm_* -- CO2 Mass Extinction *_400 ppm_* -- CO2 today *_800 ppm_* -- CO2 starvation trigger which forced plants worldwide to evolve C4 species *_1,600 ppm_* -- CO2 Normal *_4,000 ppm_* -- CO2 abundance *_8,000 ppm_* -- Rich CO2 levels, the kind which allowed so many plants that it gave us our fossil fuels *_10,000 ppm_* -- Nominal CO2 on naval submarines *_20,000 ppm_* -- Maximum recommended CO2 on NASA spacecraft *_210,000 ppm_* -- The level of oxygen in our atmosphere, and possibly the level of CO2 when Earth had zero oxygen (before photosynthesis). *_965,000 ppm_* -- CO2 level on Venus (for those who think Earth might ever be like our sister planet); but add to this the fact that its atmosphere is 92x thicker than that on Earth. This gives Venus more than 220,000 times as much CO2 in its atmosphere as we have in ours.

Zero CO2 means the death of all plant and animal life. 150 ppm CO2 means the beginning of Mass Extinction for all C3 species (85% of all plant species, and nearly 99% of all food crop species). 400 ppm = today. 800 ppm was the approximate threshold which led to the evolution of C4 species to cope with CO2 starvation. 1,200 ppm CO2 is the level at which wheat and rice yield +30 to +40% over 400 ppm. Somewhere between 1,600 to 2,300 ppm is the average CO2 level for the last 600 Myrs. At 2,000 ppm, wheat and rice yields are still +5 to +15% above those at 400 ppm. 20,000 ppm produces yields that are roughly equivalent to those at 400 ppm, and it's NASA's maximum recommended CO2 level for astronauts for up to 1 hour. Climate change is the only constant in climate. It has changed for nearly 4.5 billion years. This notion of stopping climate change is nonsense. It's like saying -- stop the wind or stop the ocean currents.	UCuhhX9p8cfLJTP5m5lm6z6Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuhhX9p8cfLJTP5m5lm6z6Q	1	UgjTaFXoTY7XyHgCoAEC	Tardigrades

Is the climate changing? Yes. Are we emitting gasses that expedite climate change? Yes. Is this bad? Possibly. We know that several thousand years ago the Sahara was a jungle. Why isn't it? Global weather changes. We also know that 65 million years ago California was a tropical forest/swamp. The climate does and always has changed. The main thing to consider is that ocean levels will rise as temperatures increase and the majority of the population is costal. That is bad. So we simply pick up and move. With current statistics I understand that converting our consumption of fossil fuels will only mitigate the time frame for which this occurs. In order to reverse what we've done we need to replant millions of acres of forest and grassland and reduce the rate at which gasses enter the atmosphere and oceans. It's sad to me that people assume this is a One way road. To know climate change is real is synonymous with thinking the Paris Climate Accords were a good idea, assuming we can and should try to reduce our carbon footprints, and that somehow we can accurately predict what the changes will look like. Personally I know the American corn belt is the biggest carbon eater globally. Better than the Amazon Rainforest and better than he swaths of plankton and algae in our oceans. But it also needs nitrogen in its soil and so is demanding. What we really need is to replant forests and work on giving land back to wildlife and wilderness. Without large amounts of plant life we cannot change the climate effectively. So this is a nonissue because it's not economical to give land back to Mother Nature. The real question facing us is how to make it economical, niece people realize they can make money reversing clumsy change they will believe the science. I for one think we should let it run its course, after all it's not necessarily bad especially when you consider Earth was at the period of most biodiversity that we can measure and as such it's likely to reduce certain populations and favor others as environments change. We as humans have the unique ability to witness, know beforehand, react, and successfully understand, all of the changes we face and as such will survive whether we do anything to stop climate change or not. Up to you really, I just don't have enough information to suggest we need to stop the climate change or enough evidence to say climate change is bad. I do still stand by its existence.

A final paper authored by a group of very renowned climate scientist concluded once and for all that: "1) Depending on exactly how you measure the expert consensus, it’s somewhere between 90% and 100% that agree humans are responsible for climate change, with most of our studies finding 97% consensus among publishing climate scientists. 2) The greater the climate expertise among those surveyed, the higher the consensus on human-caused global warming." From skepticalscience(dot)com/global-warming-scientific-consensus-intermediate.html, Consensus on Consensus - Cook et al. (2016) Why not let the experts who studied those issues their entire life talk about it instaed of thinking that us, uneducated brats, can say anything about their conclusions without even having strong evidence?

Remember when flat earther's would be right at home with those quacks that didn't believe in plate tectonics? Yeah that was only 60 years ago and the quacks were genuine scientists too... Remember how no one talks about there being more bacteria than cells in your body now when it was such a huge deal less than 4 years ago??? Remember that science isn't right or wrong and scientists do not have the answer because science is a process (a tool) and scientists that actually use science the way it's supposed to be used don't rely on any consensus at all. They rely on facts or in the case of climate a level of certainty. Today we know anthropogenic climate change is garbage. I personally have already lived through several climate apocalypses my parents have lived through even more. The reason any of us survived is because they never came to pass. People who wish we died are not following scientists or science they're following a religion.

Hoffman	+polic72andDrD3ath 6 months ago I feel like most arguments against the existence of climate change are very very VERY confirmation bias heavy It's possible most of the arguments you've paid attention to were, though that speaks perhaps more to your existing confirmation bias, and yet, suppose they were as you say, but there was just *one* argument against the existence of [anthropogenic; no one doubts climate change] that was correct. You do understand that that would mean AGW theory was *disproved*. I'd like to tell you that that has already happened, but the AGW folks have a moving target, a slick process by which they ad hoc adjust something so predictions (actually retrospective, and not proper prospective) become closer and closer to actual temperatures for a time, and they say this is simply how science works...trial, error, adjustment, and so on, but all their work is based on a computer program, a set of algorithms (do this, then do that, then do another thing) that is like a black box that they ask us to "believe in". Sorry, GIGO is and always will be true. A famous map coloring problem called the 4-color hypothesis has resisted all attempts to solve by reasoning, but was solved about 20 years ago, by having a computer create all possible planar maps and try to color all of them with 4 colors. They succeeded, though some purists were dissatisfied with the Monte Carlo method...the point being that any attempt to do the same thing with climate would require more time in calculation than the change in the climate itself would take, and any less time would involve assumptions that have to be made by individuals, many of whom have shown a vested interest.

It goes like this: Climate scientists conduct studies of the factors that contribute to climate change. Some other scientists come in and conduct a study OF THOSE STUDIES. That's the study that gives you your 97% figure. Something else to note: The scientific definition of "theory" does not mean the same thing as *your* definition of the word "theory."

Cutting our CO2 would affect maybe a -30% change. That's about 0.4%. Does anyone think changing 0.4% of the Greenhouse Effect would DO ANYTHING? That's why NASA says the Paris Accord would slow AGW by a PROJECTED -0.5 degrees! And COST 2 TRILLION! SUCH A DEAL! MOSTLY USELESS!!!!! CONSIDER: The SUN is the CAUSE of Global Warming! And, OF COURSE we can do something about it! Like THIS: When I go out in California, I usually carry an umbrella. Why not create a Space Umbrella to shield the Earth from sunlight, THE Major CAUSE of Global Warming?

"seems" is just not good enough to impose changes in a free society. For many years, it "seemed" to make sense that people could be chosen to bear children according to genetics laws, possibly leading to superior intellects/athletes/soldiers/ceo's. The theory was widely applauded by many now called Progressives. The theory itself is called Eugenics, and for multiple reasons is now discredited, disavowed, disallowed, especially as a government policy. Perhaps you know one of the governments that attempted to enact it as a basis for creating a "pure Aryan race". That is why "seems" is just not enough. The evidence for human caused global warming is completely inadequate and no basis for governmental policy.

When you know who he and his family are and what they do, you'll start to understand the lies that are spread quite frequently. Understanding what they control and how they do it, you can then think for yourself. I get tired of talking facts to people who don't understand the most basic stuff, and it all always stems from the person not knowing who the Rothschilds are. I'm tired of discussing global warming to people who believe it when it takes a few seconds to find out the polar ice caps are actually getting thicker. The Polar Bear population is increasing. Those aren't signs of global warming and they have been lying about the ice caps melting for the past few years. If you really want to know the truth, look into the Rothschilds family first. What they do, what they control, and how they have so much power. When you do that, you'll start to understand every single problem going on in the world. Every thing wrong with the Earth that you could possibly think of, from poor people, to war, it stems originally from the Rothschilds.

I don't live in the US, so you can stop thinking i am biased by some opinion. And sorry if me asking for evidence is literally opressing you lol. Co2 is not bad, excessive greenhouse effect is. Before you think i'm saying "greenhouse effect is bad" no, i just mean too much of it and the Earth's atmosphere will become too hot in certain places for certain species and certain ecosistems. Also, the natural cycle of the climate is not over thousands of years, but tens of hundreds of thousands, or even millions. Sure, you could argue that 3800 million years ago the Earth was so hot it could not host any life. Was it humans' fault? No, lol. Does it have any relevance in the argument, then? No. The natural temperature cycle of the Earth does not shift so intensely in periods of years, or decades (as much as 1-3 degrees) naturally. Now, I'm not gonna ask you to blindly trust what I'm telling you, so you can check NASA's climate stats if you would like. http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp Lastly, my type? WutFace I live in a country where the politics of scientific and technological development is a pile of shit. I have learned to not trust any corporation's bullshit, thank you. I trust the ones where I can check by myself the data they recolected, how, and in what area or period of time, etc. Don't think you know me. I study what I say before I say it.

So I'm not going to give evidence, you have to find it. However I will lead you in the right direction. The video is flat out lying, how is CO2 bad? Plants breath CO2. In fact, with all of the "pollution" humans have been doing, the Earth is greener than it has ever been. CO2 is good for the Earth, not bad. They just want you to believe it's bad. Then you find out that they are just saying it's bad so the UN can restrict other countries. They are focusing hard on China, they do not want China to advance as a country. Secondly, the Earth goes through climate change naturally. Before the Ice age there was a time when the Earth didn't even have polar ice caps. That's right, in Earth's time when it's teeming with life, it was hotter than it is now. We are still in an Ice Age and it's coming to a natural end. You need to find this evidence yourself. Look into it, don't let people spoon feed you information and then choose to ignore it. I don't understand your type at all. You eat up the garbage that big corporations and government spew out, but the moment an objective scientists presents facts with out being corrupted by money, you think they are the lying ones. Where is the logic in that? The one to gain the most money from their research is likely to be the false one.

Years ago there were studies that said cigarettes were good for you. That sounds fishy so people looked into it and saw that the scientists who did the research got their money from the tobacco companies. So of course they will change the data so they can get more money. Just because a "scientists" says something doesn't mean you should listen. This world runs on money, so the only way to find out the truth is to follow the money. So what do governments get out of this falsified data? As of right now, countries are putting restrictions on other countries to keep their CO2 commissions down, thus causing a bottle neck effect on the growth of that country. This false data is keeping nations from technologically growing so that the countries already at the top won't have competition in the future. Money, money, and more money. Just think how peaceful and unified the human race would be with out money.	UCjKoEupeJVUqrgtGbNsYC6A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjKoEupeJVUqrgtGbNsYC6A	1	UggsuGS-QcBxcngCoAEC	FireEmeralds76

They effectively wasted their lives trying to fix a problem that did not exist. when you take the actual true scientific data you will see that all the models that they put forth are not true. They modified the specifics of the models to try to make their point real and no matter how much you put lipstick on a pig it's still a pig and no matter how much you lie about global warming it is still a lie. do yourself a favor not just you everybody but look up how they got the 97% of scientists number and then you might start realizing that everything else is bullshit period three numbers you need to look at that they keep pressing 1 is the 97% of scientists say to real which is blatantly false. they talk about the ice melting when the exact opposite is true. We have more sleep now than we did 10 years ago. And they're saying that the polar bear numbers are dwindling and they're turning to cannibalism and they're about to die off and they are now on the endangered species list when the exact opposite is true if you look over the last 50 years the polar bear numbers have increased 500%. not just three number you can look at the see how bogus this whole global warming nonsense is and if you want to get a real life look at all the models and see what the temperature and everything else is supposed to be like today in comparison to what it actually is and you'll see that with the models as for Office they are who can honestly believe any of this when nothing that they predicted to come true has come true. Let me restate that fact nothing that the climate alarmist have said that was going to come true has come true every single model is wrong and wrong by a wide wide margin	UCuthoRIgZgcCLsyHRB7zFdw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuthoRIgZgcCLsyHRB7zFdw	1	UggsuGS-QcBxcngCoAEC	FireEmeralds76

That's like saying you're a god desire. Not a skeptic but a denier. and the reason people deny that climate change is real is because climate change is a natural earth cycle man made global warming is a myth. there is literally zero science to prove that man-made global warming is a real thing. Every model they came out with to say what was going to happen if we kept up the way we were going turned out to be absolutely 100% false. seriously look at every model they've come out with in the last 20 years or so what's going to happen to the earth if we keep up the way we're going and you will see that literally every single model they put out has turned out to be wrong yet they're still pushing this phony agenda that man made global warming is going to destroy the world and all this co2 will putting in the air is going to kill everything when the exact opposite is true it's actually probably good for us to have more co2 in the air because throughout a lifetime we are at record lows of co2 in the atmosphere and now that were pumping more in the air plant life around the globe starting to explode. co2 is a natural gas and the way the earth deals with it is by plants eating it cuz its plant food	UCuthoRIgZgcCLsyHRB7zFdw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuthoRIgZgcCLsyHRB7zFdw	1	UggsuGS-QcBxcngCoAEC	FireEmeralds76

But the problem is the global warming alarmists forget to look at one thing, and that is the total history of earth. It is true that we are having climate change, but that has been going on literally forever. And throughout history, we RIGHT NOW have one of the LOWEST amounts of Co2 in the environment EVER. Historically, we have thousands of times more then we do now. Now, some of the actual climate scientists I have been reading up on say that we are in the middle of a Co2 famine. Ok, so the 3/14 of a degree that we warmed up, does not concern me. We have have a "pause" for the last 20 years. But we don't count that. ALL of the models are DRASTICALLY wrong, look at what it is supposed to be like according to "the models" and they are not even close. The "science" of climate change is not science. All of the real science shows that "man made" climate change just does not exist. The business of climate change is real, but the science is not. And this 97% of scientists is the most overblown inaccurate number. 	UCuthoRIgZgcCLsyHRB7zFdw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuthoRIgZgcCLsyHRB7zFdw	1	UggsuGS-QcBxcngCoAEC	FireEmeralds76

Though the only industry that would benifit from it is new energy, otherwise everyone with wealth wants to suppress it. There's literally no reason to use coal beyond it's abundant and we know how to get it. Which... if you're not the one getting it, I can see why you'd like it. In any case, the weather's been consistently getting weirder and weirder the past two decades just by looking at it. So it's hard to think that it's normal. Not only that, but if we shift focus to solar, nuclear and wind and the whole "Man is creating climate change is bullshit" because that IS a possibility, science has been wrong in the past, we are human... What negativity would that cause? Well, apart from nuclear, though I assume any new plants would use Thorium, unless it's still too expensive, because realistically people will chose dangerous over expensive.

There is ZERO scientific evidence to prove anything of what he just said. But there is scientific evidence to prove that the global temperatures have not changed even a tiny bit in the last 20 years. so everything he just said is not true. the global ice levels are higher than they were a few years ago the polar bear population has exploded in the last 50 years there is no climate change it is a climate change that there is is a natural earth cycle. in the Roman times there was a temperature spike which it was hotter than it is now and they were fine in the 1700 there was a climate spike where the temperature is hotter than it is now and nothing bad happened. Actually the opposite happen when became more fertile in the population of the earth exploded so all this climate change nonsense is exactly that nonsense global warming is a lie it is an industry more than it is science	UCuthoRIgZgcCLsyHRB7zFdw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuthoRIgZgcCLsyHRB7zFdw	1	UggsuGS-QcBxcngCoAEC	FireEmeralds76

If you accept that we're killing our world, then that means we have to work to save it. Not only that, but it's not making easy money or life easier like other innovations. Like everyone who can do something about it, either is making money from not caring, or is too underdeveloped to switch to nuclear, wind or solar. Otherwise I think a lot of it is that when you try to convince someone of something, you often come off as talking down or just plain rude. Which makes the subject a stand-offish one... I think realistically the only way we could really work towards green energy is to have a revolution, but if people don't give a shit about getting shot dead by cops or random jerks, slave labor used to make phones or being poisoned... ehhh I don't think people are ever going to care about anything until it's far too late. Like, it's probably more likely science finds a way to reverse climate change than it is that humanity works to prevent it. I just don't think we got what it takes to become a better society... right now anyways. Like, if congress all got zapped to death by Martians or something, then sure new minds can pave a better tomorrow, but otherwise we have to wait for the old minds to die first, and by then we'll prolly have an ice age or something.

In fact if you look at the climate model prediction the increase in temperature is a simple multiple of modelled CO2 increase - this is trivial.

You may also have as much difficulty as I did trying to figure out exactly why and how some of the adjusted and unadjusted data are so distant from each other. Anyway this is one of those things you can prove by being alive for a while and tracking temperature, precipitation and other meteorological factors. Some regions are seeing warming not all most actually aren't and the only nations with any good weather records show the climate is more of the same with extra boring sameness to come for the next century at least.

Relying on the press for scientific information on climate science is as silly as relying on the press for medical advice. Anyway, the 97% consensus has been shown again and again, as discussed in table 1 of: "Consensus on consensus: a synthesis of consensus estimates on human-caused global warming [...] The consensus that humans are causing recent global warming is shared by 90%–100% of publishing climate scientists according to six independent studies by co-authors of this paper. Those results are consistent with the 97% consensus reported by Cook et al (Environ. Res. Lett. 8 024024) based on 11 944 abstracts of research papers, of which 4014 took a position on the cause of recent global warming. [...] We examine the available studies and conclude that the finding of 97% consensus in published climate research is robust and consistent with other surveys of climate scientists and peer-reviewed studies." http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/4/048002/meta In table 1 of that paper, you'll find at least five studies that get the 97% figure: 1) Oreskes (2004) 2) Doran and Zimmerman (2009) 3) Anderegg et. al. (2010) 4) Cook et. al (2013) 5) Carlton et. al. (2015) *"This just serves to show how little you guys actually fact check where these statistics come from."* Says the person who did so little homework that they think the 97% figure comes from just 1 study...

UggbNGiVRR3DB3gCoAEC.8C77Uz0xitH8CsZX0iKKKZ		3	2016-04-20 03:34:01	Matthew Robbins	+10thyoung I'll give you that, insults are never the way to go in an educated conversation. John Cook is a fellow at the University of Queensland. His website is a collection of peer reviewed studies and won the Australian Museum Eureka prize, he has co-authored college textbooks, he has work published in "the Best Australian Science Writing 2014". His work is revered by scientific experts and professionals, so the fact that he used to be a cartoonist really means nothing, it's a red herring. With that being said, there are a handful of peer reviewed articles which point out flaws in his study, I won't argue with that. Most of these, however, are more because the idea of consensus is so ambiguous in a this kind of discussion. Take the most famous of rebukes, for instance, which is likely Richard Tol's criticism. Tol, himself, has no doubt that there is major scientific agreement, he just had issue with how the study was conducted and its ideas of what qualifies as consensus.

Use Fourier, but all of his thinking, not just the part he rejected &quot;greenhouse effect&quot;, and explain how a glass covered building that does not allow wet air expansion to rise (doing work) can be considered a model for anything but another greenhouse.

The actual physics is that these gases like carbon dioxide, methane absorb the infrared radiations from the sun and convert them into their vibrational energy. Later on as they absorb more infrared radiation i.e. Heat.. they start losing this vibrational energy again in the form of heat because it is the easiest and simplest mode of loss of energy. That's why we see that most losses of energy in our nature and even in the industrial sector are into heat like friction and air resistance	UCtjXrT05__XAH-vIxpFuMfg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtjXrT05__XAH-vIxpFuMfg	1	UgjZEQ0Zjl8k7XgCoAEC	W.

Do you think ExonMobil cares for green energy more than money? I'd say government research, at least non US and other countries heavily reliable on oil, are the most trust worthy. Hydrogen is actually more efficient (NASA used it for the space shuttles, when they still did those). The only real downside of it is compared to gasonline is that it's less fuel eficient than most post mid-90's cars per liter. Currently they are trying to get them in some places, but only iceland (being a island with small population) has hydrogen tanking spots as common as gas. I'd hardly call government action immoral. How I see it it's more is saving people from themselves if need be by disincentivising certain actions. Most places already have such a system in place to a certain extend.

Maybe it could improve, and I'm all for researching into new technologies to get there, both privately for business and through crowdsourcing. I don't believe in government funded research., People shouldn't be forced into supporting research they disagree with. Moreover, why should we let stuffy, dusty old politicians decide what gets funded? At least we can agree they are idiots for blocking nuclear energy. Hydrogen cars? I don't know much about that. You can make an engine based on this that is as energy dense or more than gasoline? What about the cost? I guess we won't agree on government action. I am all for moving towards a greener world, I just don't believe in using force to get there. If I am unable to convince people, it is my own failure.

Great for, what they would call local, in america.  BTW what a bloody idiots they are for blocking nuclear. It's like they still live in the 70's... But Hydrogen is a good alternative even for transport, granted expensive to implement. And fabrication of such cars is also polluting, but most of that can be solved by making the power grid cleaner. And I agree that climate change isn't a doomsday scenario in the near future. But at the end of the day I trust nature to keep itself in balance for more than I do people, even if there wouldn't be a consensus. And I'm not saying everybody should be forced to go green or some shit like that. I'm saying that the government should make the green alternative more attractive than the more polluting actions. And of course take steps to make the green alternative more available.	UC9alC0hdOjXy0alq60m00cQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9alC0hdOjXy0alq60m00cQ	1	UghgqfkHHnKmaHgCoAEC	Thijmen

It's not economical at all yet. Nuclear is great, and here in the USA it's the government that is blocking more of them. That's hilarious. Instead of them forcing a green agenda on us, they're preventing people from freely choosing to go that way. Was the government that shut down their prototype liquid thorium reactor.  It doesn't solve portable energy though.  Electric cars draw their power from the grid, which isn't very clean right now because of the government. They also pollute a lot purely in their fabrication. They are also not practical for larger transport and shipping vehicles/boats/planes.  Portable energy is the real issue, and moving away to greener energies is not wrong or bad, as long as it is gradual and done without force. It's not possible in poorer countries. They need the cheapest energy possible to get work done, to get energy available.  The main point of the article to is to demonstrate that climate change is not a doomsday end of the world catastrophic nightmare that demands we give up all of our freedom to fight it, as the media would portray it. It's a minor concern, possibly a minor benefit for the next few decades (there is no scientific consensus on this part) and something that should be thought of carefully, not recklessly. 	UCNe-2bQv3BWT0TIns5edqbA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNe-2bQv3BWT0TIns5edqbA	1	UghgqfkHHnKmaHgCoAEC	Thijmen

Green energy is quite efficient. I live for a goo 50% of windmills and the other largely on nuclear (which is also extremely clean, at least when done in modern facilities). So I can safely say it's really efficient. Not to mention in most places you can build hydroelectric dams. And considering how most people use their cars, using electric would be still be quite functional. Not to mention hydrogen would be a full replacement without much, if any, loss. And of course their are positives. But they don't outway the negatives. Polar bears can fish more in winter but malaria (and other tropical diseases) also spread more and of course other species hurt more. Then we have rising of sea levels which comes hand in hand with flooding. The acidity is getting more off which hurts ocean life not to mention more oxygen starved areas (which is already suffering due to overfishing). Because that article you shown only uses almost anecdotal points to show his view, but it isn't remotely hard to think of any flip side of the thing he names in other locations.

Proper diagnosis of the problem before could prevent your crashing but that means you have to look at the problem and recognize it and you can't let your biases or shortcuts influences you (watch some of the "why Planes crash" on the Science Channel sometimes). Sometimes the truth doesn't fit what you want it to fit. So just demeaning people who disagree with you isn't going to solve the problem and more than blind faith in your biases will.

The people who refuse to accept the facts (and those vested interests pulling their strings!) make it harder for those who can to put forth the needed efforts. It's a lot like flying a plane. You end up in a situation where you won't make it back to the airport. You make the best effort to at least affect a survivable crash landing even if you know you'll wreck your aircraft.

Stability is key, if a nation isn't stable it dies out and is replaced by one that is. Government isn't (though you may like to imagine) a single dictator controlling everything, especially not in most democratic or socialist system. The people in charge can't just decide one day to screw us over, they are dependent on us as much as we are on them. You can't bite the hand that feeds you. That's the theory anyway, in reality democracy in vulnerable to corruption and lobby groups so that doesn't actually happen too often. That's why interconnection between nations is mandatory; it minimizes corruption because cooperation is forced. Putting governments, elected by the people, in charge of this distribution reduces this even further because unlike a CEO a president isn't (supposed) to make a profit from an exchange.

Dependence on other nations for resources increases the need for strong ties between nations and reduces the chance of conflict. It's why Saudi Arabia and America or China and Australia are so close when they differ so greatly politically. Saudi Arabia needs American money and America needs foreign oil, Australia needs Chinese money and China needs foreign coal. I know Americans (and a lot of other countries) tend to be kind of xenophobic and don't like the idea of asking for help, but in this case you don't really have a reasonable choice. It's get flooded or pay two cents for clean energy from Africa. This is even better because it benefits the environment and isn't a short term thing like trading a few barrels of oil. You can always switch suppliers when you're dealing with raw product, but you can't do that so easily when they own both the product and means of production.

Some behavioral economics studies looked at how high would gas prices need to go before it affected consumption. Various studies find that it'd have to be $6 to $12 a gallon before anyone changed their spending habbits. So Europe is probably on the right track at least on gas prices.

'Big' government, as the scared americans call it, is the most efficient way to get things done on a large scale within a country. Sure, you have to keep them in check, but we do have ways to do this. I also don't believe that it's the power the government has that these people are scared about. They are scared they will have to give more of their own money for social constructs. That they have to help others gain equal opportunity that they have, instead of them helping themselves. It's a selfish display that, quite frankly, sickens me. Not to mention that europe shows it just works. Eh, yeah, I'm one of those european socialist nazi asshole pigs things. sigh..

Even Adam Smith believed the governments ought to intervene in market failures. When the private cost of production does not reflect the total (social) cost of production, the market tends to over produce, causing a market failure. This is precisely the case with pollution from production today. When you buy a gallon of gas, a portion of the cost is paid by you (about $3 where I am) and another portion is paid in environmental damages that negatively affect others. Because I do not incur the total cost of that gallon of gas, I will purchase more gasoline than is socially optimal. Governments have a role here is correcting prices. This scenario could use a per unit tax on CO2 emissions that will correct the price of gasoline to reflect the total social cost of production (private costs+environmental costs+health costs= social costs). In the case of taxes that serve to change consumer behavior it is important for governments to provide alternative options so that consumers do not lose utility from the tax. In this case, the government could reduce income tax by the same rate that they will increase the CO2 tax rate such that tax revenue remains the same if consumers do nothing to change their behavior. This will both increase the cost of gasoline, but then give consumers enough money to afford cheaper or equivalent alternatives such as "green" vehicles and maybe a really nice bicycle. This does not give the government more power. It is a fair and intended use of government power. This is the most capitalistic method to reduce pollution: getting the prices right.

By almost overnight then, I mean a year or two. Nuclear energy is really the way forward. All the horror stories are false dramatizations of it. But it shouldnt be the only one. It should be added by hydro, geo, solar and wind energy on a more localized scale. If we have an abundance of energy, the development would also help stimulate electric cars and bio-oils for plastics.

UghgqfkHHnKmaHgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-AYUY7-H3zEodedP		2	2014-12-08 22:56:44	Grimm	@relo999 Don''t forget waste incineration. It has the same energy conversion efficiency as oil (33%), recycles waste materials, and is a waste disposal method. They are also creating ways to reduce waste to energy incinerators CO2 emissions (which are already lower than coal and oil and some natural gas power plants). My problem with what you said is that, if the government paid 25% of a "green" car, my taxes would go way up. I think CO2 taxes would work better. A subsidy on a car would only benefit me if I then went and bought that car, otherwise it would just increase my taxes even if I sold my car and bought a bike (which is even more favorable than any kind of car). A tax on the pollutant allows the consumer to make the choice of what they buy while also providing the government with more funding for additional programs. Individuals may even be indifferent to the tax if policy changes included a reduction in taxes elsewhere. If we reduced income tax and raised carbon taxes such that people were paying the same amount of taxes if they continued their current consumption habits, people would be indifferent to the tax increase because we would have effectively given them more money to spend. However, because they now saw the price of gas go up and their wallets grow and slowly drain as they continued driving their big car, they may be more inclined to change their spending habits. There are other policy options that exist beyond these mentioned that cost very little from the government but still change consumer behavior.

UghgqfkHHnKmaHgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-AYUY7-H2sS5sFTl		10	2014-12-08 22:47:04	Grimm	There are solutions, the trouble is implementation. Implementation is a problem because much of the world is a democracy and therefore policies that are good for the people but do not have the consent of the people are hard to pass. This is why it is important for people to understand and acknowledge climate change. There are, of course, other problems with policy solutions. These policies often, at least in the short run, curb economic growth by taxing or limiting pollution. Because pollution is a result of physical capital production, reducing the pollution allowances temporarily reduce the economy's ability to produce physical goods. That reduces the number of jobs, especially in poorer areas that rely on the production of physical goods. So policies need to also exist that aid those that will be negatively affected by the temporary economic downturn. In short, environmental policies are expensive and unpopular, but are (at least eventually) necessary. We can only reduce the cost of the policies by enacting them sooner rather than later, and we can make them less unpopular by educating the public.

UghgqfkHHnKmaHgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-AYUY7-H1tyjAgQf		18	2014-12-08 22:38:33	Relo	Actually, we can. Theoretically. If governments would pay say 25% of a "green" car it would help a lot with downing the gasoline use in the automobile industry. Not to mention modern, state of the art, radioactive plants have little waste compared to the common, mid/early 80's, ones in use now. (If I remember correctly the waste would be 1% of material used, of which all would have a half time of 24 years to regular lead, which is nothing compared to the common ones) And wind/sun power is unreliable for all energy, if you don't want to split the atom you'll always need fossil fuels for a steady supply of power. So I think fear of nuclear energy is a far worse offender than not believing. Because, unless you are some kind of car fanatic, you don't really car where your energy comes from as long as it's there. And of course economic issues.

The light heats up the earth. The warm earth radiates energy back into space, cooling it. The energy radiated back out is primarily infrared light. CO2 and methane are opaque to infrared light, so they prevent that energy from going back into space. A greenhouse gas is any gas that is transparent to visible to light and opaque to infrared light. "Stronger" greenhouse gasses are more opaque to infrared than weaker greenhouse gasses." Best way to sum it all up. Not everything is a conspiracy by the way.

Lobbyists attempted to discredit the scientific research by creating doubt and manipulating debate. They worked to discredit the scientists involved, to dispute their findings, and to create and maintain an apparent controversy by promoting claims that contradicted scientific research. The tobacco industry has historically relied on a dismissal of correlational evidence to reject a link between tobacco and lung cancer. For example, the tobacco industry abused this fallacy to argue that simply because smoking correlates with lung cancer that does not mean that smoking causes lung cancer. The simple correlation is not enough to arrive at a conclusion of causation. Today however, nobody in their right mind would deny smoking causes cancer.

Other planets are also getting warmer, that’s normal. About 70 years ago scientists were talking about ”global cooling” then ”global warming” and now mostly: ”climate change” they said all the scientists were agreed that we made the climate cooler, but now it’s the opposite. Why should we beleve it now, A few years ago (like 20) ”scientists” said that there would be a global disaster 10 years later, now it’s 20 years later and nothing big has happend. The co2 in the atmosphere doesn’t match the temprature of earth either, there are videos from 1900 that showed the glaciers had already started melting.

Even if the world were incontrovertibly warmer 1,000 years ago, it would not change the fact that the recent rapid rise in CO2 explains the current episode of warming more credibly than any natural factor does—and that no natural factor seems poised to offset further warming in the years ahead.

The 1930’s were very hot years in the United States. However, global warming takes into account temperatures over the entire planet, including the oceans. The land area of the U.S. accounts for only 2% of Earth's total surface area. Despite the U.S. sweltering in the 30’s, those years were not especially hot over the rest of the planet.

Natural CO2 is not static, however. It is generated by natural processes, and absorbed by others. But consider what happens when more CO2 is released from outside of the natural carbon cycle – by burning fossil fuels. Although our output of 29 gigatons of CO2 is tiny compared to the 750 gigatons moving through the carbon cycle each year, it adds up because the land and ocean cannot absorb all of the extra CO2. About 40% of this additional CO2 is absorbed. The rest remains in the atmosphere, and as a consequence, atmospheric CO2 is at its highest level in millions of years.

Whether or not the climate change that I'm experiencing is spurred by global warming is another matter, but it's undeniably a change in the climate. Also, back to my original point, from the research that I've looked at, the average global temperature has risen by 2 degrees celsius in the past century. The ozone layer has been depleting. The great barrier reef is not quite as great as it used to be. The Arctic ice has been slowly but undeniably melting. Sure, I've never been to antarctica and I don't have my own personal satellite, but if it makes me narrow-minded to believe the statistics that I've seen as opposed to assuming that climate change is some sort of hoax cooked up by the government for god-knows-what reason, then doesn't that make you a conspiracy theorist?

So in other words I coould survive in that room, because the amount of oxygen stays the same, because I am exhaling CO2, and the tree is producing oxygen. Either way I'd be fine. I mean plants do not respirate anyway, or else they would lliterally be wasting all the energy they got, and they would die. Pretty simple logic, I don't get howw it can be that hard to understand.

The process of photosynthesis is a process in which plants take in sunlight and convert it to energy. The equation is 6CO2 + 6H20 -->(light) C6H12O6 + 6O2. Although photosynthesis is performed differently by different species, the process always begins when energy from light is absorbed by proteins called reaction centres that contain green chlorophyll pigments. Carbon dioxide is converted to glucose through carbon fixation in the chloroplasts of plants. TL;DR: You have absolutely no idea what you are talking about.

I implore you to be more honest in the future + 2 address your bias so that you can have a more open mind. I too am a college professor. I was like you for a while and assumed my position. But as I was working day and night on a series of patents to address global warming I looked at the data more closely. I can tell you I hate being lied to. The first thing I discovered was there is no empirical data showing that CO2 has increased temperatures. There is however significant data showing that increasing temperatures have generated a significant positive correlation With CO2 levels. That my friend it&#39;s just the tip of the iceberg. You either know the truth and don&#39;t care or you don&#39;t know the truth and don&#39;t care. Because, if you did care you would begin pointing out the large number of inconsistencies and inaccuracies not to mention the huge number of lies and fraud. Such as the fact that ocean levels are not accelerating, there is no increase in extreme weather according to virtually every reputable scientist, glaciers have been melting since the mid-1800s, NASA manipulation of surface temperatures, etc etc etc! You seem to be very good at YouTube so I implore you to address your biases and be more comprehensive in certain areas. God bless you and I wish you and yours well.

And again, having an "expert" status doesn't mean what you say is true. And no, 97% of climate scientists do NOT say anthropogenic "greenhouse gas" emissions are the driver behind climate change. You have been mislead. Why I assume the IPCC needs models? Because nearly all their "research" is based on them. Why you shouldn't base your opinion on short videos?

You arent special. Stop pretending to be. And another one of your stupid points is "Lmao you get your information off 5-10 minute youtube videos?" Yes. I do. What is wrong with that?

The 1st claim is that atmospheric CO2 concentration is the dominant variable behind climate change and that the small share of it that is man-made is crucial. The long periods in earth history where atm. CO2 concentration was several magnitudes higher than todays (e.g. 5x, Jurassic) and average surface temperature was only moderately above (+2°C, Jurassic) or even comparable to todays does not fit with this.

Here are the holes I noticed in this video. <br /><br />1)you said &quot;Right now, earths global temperatures are increasing faster than at the end of an ice age&quot;<br /><br />So? Why is that significant? Which ice age? Isn&#39;t the end of an Ice Age a very slow and cold process to begin with? Aren&#39;t those comparisons apples and oranges? Why does that fact mean anything?<br /><br />2) &quot;more carbon dioxide MEANS average temperatures across the globe are increasing, and fast.&quot;<br /><br />You never established that rising CO2 is causing a rise global temperature. Just asserted that without giving us any evidence. You owe us that. <br /><br />Also, you didn&#39;t Establish that global temperature was increasing quickly recently or that it was a significant departure from the last thousand or so years. You said hotter than when we began measuring in 1850. But it wasn&#39;t by much. A few degrees? That is hardly evidence of a continuing or earth threading trend. <br /><br />3) recent years have seen a stoppage of rising global average temperature. Why isn&#39;t that addressed? It&#39;s like it was intentionally ignored. <br /><br />4) you didn&#39;t mention ice sheets not deviating form average size. Overall. You mentioned summer but didn&#39;t mention winter sea ice evening that out. <br /><br />Need these answered before moving forward.

Although it should be an imperative to save our planet, but veganism is just a bandaid solution. The rainforests as you've brought up will still be in danger. We don't just destroy resources, at the very least we utilize them for better or worse. So what we need is a cheaper alternative to the rainforests resources. The same goes for factory farming, we really just need to come up with a way that would incentivize free range ranches. I don't know of one, but veganism would be too impractical, given that the main reason it's advocated for is on moral grounds. I will admit that getting more veggies into your diet and cutting out processed food would largely improve our health, but it comes down to the fact that most people like pizza more than broccoli.

Animals raised in the usual mass production we have dont get b12 anymore, because it comes from natural soils. These animals get fed with B12 pills, so you dont have too. Its a less known fact though. Iam eating meat for health issues btw. ANd yes for taste and all the other stuff. My body stores energy very very badly, so I have to consume at least 3k calories every day to hold a normal weight. And iam of average size. This is not only very time consuming and exhausting, it can also be expensive if you dont want to consume 3 liters of milk or coke a day. When I measure price/calories/taste/health/time a meat/wheatproduct combination is just the best option.

For example, only 10% of all energy in the fish that eagles consume ends up stored in the eagles' flesh. And as far as I've read, there's nothing inherently harmful about digesting a more plant-based diet. After all, we did evolve from hunter _gatherers_, and the hunting was much less often than the gathering. If anything, the amount of meat we Americans eat, especially red meat, is less than healthy.

Veganism is totally unsustainable. A field of beautiful natural grasses being browsed by creatures eating foods that come naturally to them, efficiently converting cellulose into protein.

Convenience 3. Tradition 4. Habit For me it was just a habit. Judging from your comment you eat animal products mostly for convenience and taste. Anyway, your next point was that it's unnatural and somehow "hard" to take a B12 supplement, yes? I don't see how it's hard, as my B12 supplementen tastes like vanilla and takes less than 10 seconds to consume. So unless you also have trouble consuming Mentos, you won't have a "hard time" consuming a B12 supplement. And if you are, for whatever reason, against taking supplements, you can just eat vegan foods fortified with B12. There, problem solved. I just take B12 supplements because it is a reliable and cheap option. Oh and you can't just say "meat has 4x more proteins" and then not mention which plant food you compare it to. That's un-scientific. But I'm judging from that comment you are concerned about protein, yes? Fear not because all plant foods have all 9 essential animo acids. michaelbluejay.com On this website you can find more information. I urge you to read this article if you want to know more. And lastly, thank you for answering my question with intellectual honesty. Most people would avoid the question or simply lie because they don't want to be honest with themselves.

Either way, the answer is that not just taste pleasure comes into the equation here, one can acquire many things from animals that sometimes are very hard to get from plants (B12 I'm looking at you), and is much easier and simpler to just consume animals. For pure taste pleasure, maybe not, but when there are multiple choices involved, humans naturally take the simplest and least suspicious option available, like eating meat, a natural custom, instead of taking "weird" vitamin pills every day, or eating meat, which has more proteins (around 4 times as much.) So if you are making a comment purely on taste, I would probably not eat meat. But normally, because it is much simpler and easier, then I would eat meat, and taste pleasure is an added but welcome benefit. (Some people disagree and say that it doesn't taste good, and I say that they can eat whatever they want.)

It&#39;s just upset to see that most of the people care about the EU and Brexit and politics, and yet people are blind just to see that climate change and plastic pollution is a bigger threat towards wildlife and the future generation. I wish that people over all the world can hopefully open their eyes from the darkness and see that this problem can be resolved. Climate change cant be stopped, it&#39;s got to a point where it will cause the wildlife and our population extinction just because we didn&#39;t understand the effects of our mess with CO². just because we &quot;can&#39;t stop climate change &quot;it doesn&#39;t mean that we should keep going with our ways. We all should take on the main problem and change it to make the whole planet a better place for both humans and the wildlife.<br />Thanks for reading :D	UC7MjQpOUEmmqxTks909rKbg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7MjQpOUEmmqxTks909rKbg	0

We watched your video to learn about climate change and we answered your question in class, as a paper. Here are the students opinions: <br /> <br />Francesc: <br />Nothing changes suddenly on people’s lifes, so if they can’t see it they don’t believe it. <br /> <br />Marc: They don’t believe in climate change, because some politicians, say that it’s fake, or it’s the normal cycle of the Earth. <br /> <br />Noé: Because they suppose that this won’t change their lifes, or it is too difficult to this could happen... <br /><br /><br />I hope you like their comments!

When you fill in data you don't have, you can make the average anything you want. I don't think you really grasp the concept of any "average" at all, do you? What they are doing is analogous to saying the increase in average income of the US is the same as the average increase in income of a small state like Vermont. Except it's worse because they at least have that data and income is pretty easy to track. Weather station are subject to many variables that make their data unreliable.

Not to mention you can't make any conclusion based on one year, which wasn't even *globally* very hot but hey, details. *"They fill in data with what they don't have to make it fit their conclusion."* Have you actually looked what they do, or are you assuming here? *"trace gas"* So is ozone, yet nobody says that isn't important. There's 0,04% of CO2, yet there's 0,000007% of ozone to protect us from lethal solar radiation. There's 78% nitrogen and it's worthless as a greenhouse gas. *"which has been much higher in the past"* So what? They don't contradict with anything. Why would they? *"Ice is starting to grow again in the arctic"* You mean one year fluctuation? Try 3 decade long down trend. *"what if"* What if spiderman fought batman? *"solar physicist are saying the next 10 years will be colder"* No, they say the sun will be colder. The Earth's climate is affected by multible things, not just sun. Temperatures might not even drop. Still, citation needed. *"Some are even predicting a little ice age"* Peer reviewed scientific paper published in respected scientific journal is needed to verify your claims.

That's why looking at the data for the US is more accurate. They fill in data with what they don't have to make it fit their conclusion. It is absurd on it's face to think a trace gas like CO2, which has been much higher in the past according to ice cores, is controlling our climate like these alarmist are trying to say it does. Ice is starting to grow again in the arctic and what if we start having very severe winters and short summers in the Northern Hemisphere?

Less heat coming from the sun. Come on, you're the one who said he studied sunspots. You know that in the past few decades Earth has received less solar irradiation. Less sun. Less heat. So why are you pretending that less heat means a warming planet? That's silly. & what did you mean by "Did you seriously think that a planet in equilibrium would continue to warm forever because of a heat source? " I mean just that. Less sun means cooling if no other conditions change. But conditions are changing. I wonder if those changes include... CO2?

That is the major cause of all warming.CO2 doesnt have the potential to FORCE a warming trend predicted by IPCC,which willfully ignores watervapour which causes +90% of GW effect. Even past atmospheric conditions which prevailed on this planet indicate raise of CO2 as an aftereffect of temperature increase,but never a forcing agent which causes temperature to increase. *Cambrian The Cambrian lasted 55.6 million years from the end of the preceding Ediacaran Period 541 million years ago (mya) to the beginning of the Ordovician Period 485.4 mya. Mean atmospheric CO2 content over period duration-> 4500 ppm (16 times pre-industrial level) Mean surface temperature over period duration 21 °C (7 °C above modern level) *Devonian 60 million years from the end of the Silurian, 419.2 million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Carboniferous, 358.9 Mya. Mean atmospheric CO2 content over period duration ->2200 ppm (8 times pre-industrial level) Mean surface temperature over period duration 20 °C (6 °C above modern level) *Carboniferous The Carboniferous is a geologic period and system that spans 60 million years from the end of the Devonian Period 358.9 million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Permian Period, 298.9 Mya. Mean atmospheric CO2 content over period duration-> 800 ppm (3 times pre-industrial level) Mean surface temperature over period duration 14 °C (0 °C above modern level) *Permian which spans 47 million years from the end of the Carboniferous Period 298.9 million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Triassic period 251.902 Mya. Mean atmospheric CO2 content over period duration-> 900 ppm (3 times pre-industrial level) Mean surface temperature over period duration 16 °C (2 °C above modern level) *Triassic which spanned 50.6 million years from the end of the Permian Period 251.9 million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Jurassic Period 201.3 Mya. Mean atmospheric CO2 content over period duration-> 1750 ppm (6 times pre-industrial level) Mean surface temperature over period duration ->17 °C (3 °C above modern level) *Jurassic which spanned 56 million years from the end of the Triassic Period 201.3 million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Cretaceous Period 145 Mya. Mean atmospheric CO2 content over period duration ->1950 ppm (7 times pre-industrial level) Mean surface temperature over period duration ->16.5 °C (3 °C above modern level) *Cretaceous which spanned 79 million years from the end of the Jurassic Period 145 million years ago (mya) to the beginning of the Paleogene Period 66 mya. Mean atmospheric CO2 content over period duration ->1700 ppm (6 times pre-industrial level) Mean surface temperature over period duration ->18 °C (4 °C above modern level) *Paleogene which spanned 43 million years from the end of the Cretaceous Period 66 million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Neogene Period 23.03 Mya. Mean atmospheric CO2 content over period duration ->500 ppm (2 times pre-industrial level) Mean surface temperature over period duration ->18 °C (4 °C above modern level) I am sure CO2 is not driving GW effect as IPCC thinks it does.it might contribute some which is negligible in grand scale of our climate system. with all data i went through till date,I think Sun spot activity bears a close relation to warming trends of last century.

The scientific database is FILLED with conflicting data, and even things that were considered “facts” (because science said so) have been proven wrong sooo many times before. Science isn’t perfect and has many downfalls. Just because a scientific study said something doesn’t mean it’s the ultimate and absolute truth. The tendency to stop all questioning as soon as a piece of evidence is reportedly “scientific” is the silliest thing I see non-scientists do. Because any good scientist will then consider, well how was the study designed, what were the variables, what was measured, is that measured outcome a proper one to consider to support the hypothesis, etc. This is especially important when the claim is something as extreme as omggg mass extinction incoming!!!

I was making a general comment on how the public tends to view and interpret scientific data. And specifically in regards to climate change, this is causing a state of panic and mob-mentality. This has led people to blindly assume, in the name of science, that humans will go extinct. Considering such drastic consequences, based on so little we know about climate science, a field already riddled with so many unknown unknown variables, warrants additional skepticism. Again, I'm not saying climate scientists are wrong (in fact, they're more likely to be right than anyone else on this world), but I would be much more hesitant before jumping to extreme conclusions as to what and to what degree those effects will be.As for my personal opinion on climate change, I'm still trying to find a stance, which is why I was watching this video. I do believe that there is a good chance that climate change is real and that humans influenced it, but the outcome of these events (extinction, or other extreme consequences), to me, seem way over exaggerated. I do, however, full heartedly support making changes to have a cleaner environment, for health reasons and to stay on the cautious side. I'm pretty new to this topic and in the process of learning more. Maybe you could enlighten me.

And at one point there were no land masses, only water... at one point it rained for millions of years... at one point bugs were the size of cars when those CO2 levels were at that 3000X level... at one point there were only single celled amoebas before that. At one point the earth was a boiling ball of lava bombarded by meteorites before that... What's the reliance today in CO2 being 3000 times higher to this discussion in the video? Disinformation from Big Oil to the uninformed? Or do you mean a current life apocalypse will be survived by the fittest life forms who remain, yet again? Like all the other ones? The point here is to try and survive, not let humankind's stupidity run unabated until the last profits of Big Oil are realized. It was also the case that NOTHING could eat the trunks of the TREES when CO2 levels were 3000 times higher than today, trees were a new thing, from plants. This lasted for over a million years, then finally the bugs could digest the bark and the ecosystem and the atmosphere completely changed. That's the part you left out and also that then the car sized bugs died off.

The temperature is circa 18c.<br /><br /><br />in<br />the Jurassic period the co2 concentration was 2000ppm, [5 times<br />greater than today] the temperature was 22c.<br /><br /><br />in<br />the Triassic period the co2 concentration was 2500ppm [ 6 times<br />greater than today] the temperature was 22c. <br /><br /><br />in<br />the Ordovician period the co2 concentration was 3000ppm [7.5 times<br />greater than today] the temperature was 17c <br /><br /><br />in<br />the Cambrian period the co2 concentration was 6000ppm [15 times<br />greater than today] the temperature was 22c <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />For<br />most of the time the planet was thriving not frying, the data shows<br />that temperature is independent of co2 concentration <br /><br /><br />Look<br />at the data for the Cambrian. The co2 concentration is 15 times what<br />it is today but the temperatures is about the same as it is today.<br />Look at the Ordovician , the CO2 concentration was 7.5 greater<br />than it is today and yet the temperature was 2 degrees lower<br />than it is today.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Some<br />people who have read this data seem to  get upset about it. They<br />describe these simple data sets above as &#39;bullshit&#39; etc etc.<br /><br /><br />the<br />data I have given above is standard information that can be easily<br />verified by checking its validity on the many websites that cover<br />this subject. These data sets have been around for many years, there<br />is nothing controversial about them.	UCLvzsok5MqSHBeV4e7qpA5g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLvzsok5MqSHBeV4e7qpA5g	0

The CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is thus irrelevant to the greenhouse effect, because its concentration in the atmosphere doesn't affect the intensity of such effect.

All I&#39;m going to say here is this...<br /><br />When it&#39;s too late and everything happens at once, you&#39;ll learn the hard way. If you refuse to believe the warning signs nature and Earth are sending now, then you&#39;ll have to learn the hard way. People always have to learn the hard way before they finally wake up and realize there&#39;s a real problem. That&#39;s the way it has to be, I guess. You can provide all evidence and tell a denier all you want, but you can&#39;t make him believe it. It must be human nature to deny everything until it&#39;s too late. Luckily, some people (including yours truly) have chosen to believe these things and not rely on human nature.<br /><br />Call me anything you want and insult me until you&#39;re blue in the face for all I care, deniers.

Man's CO2 emissions have PERHAPS added 0.2C of beneficial warming recovery since the end of the LITTLE ICE AGE in 1850, and because CO2 forcing is logarithmic (each incremental increase has less and less of an effect) we'll enjoy another 0.3C of beneficial CO2 induced warming between now and 2100, which is a good thing.... Unfortunately, the sun is approaching a Grand Solar Minimum event from 2035 and will last 50~100 years, which will cause significant global cooling. The stupid CAGW hypothesis projected 3C~5C of catastrophic manmade global warming by 2100.... Global temps will actually be COOLER by 2100 than they are now.... Grow up and stop believing government propaganda.... CAGW is ALREADY a disconfirmed hypothesis given the HUGE disparity and duration of disparity between CAGW projections vs. reality: https://drinkingwateradvisor.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/pages-from-christyjr_epa_2014_publiccomment.jpg The HUGE disparity only increases quickly in the years and decades ahead.

UgyMoFex6fTLg0j6Mm94AaABAg	1	0	2019-10-29 22:54:23	Kiku Futaba	One of the most common misconceptions concerns the so-called “scientific proofs.” Contrary to popular belief, there is no such thing as scientific proof.<br />Proofs exist only in mathematics and logic, not in science. Mathematics and logic are both closed, self-contained systems of propositions, whereas science is empirical and deals with nature as it exists. The primary criterion and standard of evaluation of scientific theory is evidence, not proof. All else equal (such as internal logical consistency and parsimony), scientists prefer theories for which there is more and better evidence to theories for which there is less and worse evidence. Proofs are not the currency of science.<br /><br />Proofs have two features that do not exist in science: They are final, and they are binary. Once a theorem is proven, it will forever be true and there will be nothing in the future that will threaten its status as a proven theorem (unless a flaw is discovered in the proof). Apart from the discovery of an error, a proven theorem will forever and always be a proven theorem.<br /><br />In contrast, all scientific knowledge is tentative and provisional, and nothing is final. There is no such thing as final proven knowledge in science. The currently accepted theory of a phenomenon is simply the best explanation for it among all available alternatives. Its status as the accepted theory is contingent on what other theories are available and might suddenly change tomorrow if there appears a better theory or new evidence that might challenge the accepted theory. No knowledge or theory (which embodies scientific knowledge) is final. Your entire assertion it is settled is in fact not scientific and just a belief system.

Foil fuels make up the vast majority of the energy we use, including when you are driving your electric car (that produces more CO2 in production than conventional cars). Solar and wind are too diffuse and inconsistent, hydro is completely tapped, and geothermal produces more nuclear waste than nuclear reactors, watt-for-watt. the only option besides fossil fuels is literally nuclear and environmentalists won&#39;t touch it with a 10-mile pole. taxing carbon just increases the cost of living, which could literally kill people in less developed countries who need every bit of energy they can get their hands on.

You dont have to spend long at a University to see, this is a theological school, with facts determined as being supported by literature which in turn is supported by literature in a cycle. No hard evidence, no facts. It's cultural Marxism. If Climatology is correct, then the World can not be saved. And since the facts are not certain, Game Theory would suggest to do nothing about it. Most Climatologist dont agree, this was falsified evidence by a researcher (the old fashioned word for a Scientist) named Cook. A real Scientist can not bring guesstimation into the equation, so the facts are unknown. What ever money big oil has, UN has more. There are ex-oil execs at the UN who decide how much oil each country can produce. Its a bigger paycheck. This is a Fabian socialist marriage between business and government to drive the price of oil high. That tax money goes back to oil companies to develop renewables, badly. You must apply critical thinking here. The only buyer in town for Scientists is government grants. You seem to have fallen for the head count fallacy (something is not a fact if a majority say it is, the fact that it can not be proven makes it not a fact). If your still convinced by bad Science then I have land to sell you 1km in from sea, in 12 years it will be beach front and worth a fortune - right?

With climate change, you have evidence and reasoning for unfortunate situations that may arise. With belief in a deity, I believe you have neither evidence against its presence, nor a rationale that promotes the 'good' in lacking faith. I would like to understand any arguments against my case if you wouldn't mind making them.

Radiative forcing from CO2 has continued, as it did during earlier periods of global warming: Atmospheric warming (tropospheric warming ans stratospheric cooling): "Comparing tropospheric warming in climate models and satellite data" "Sensitivity of Satellite-Derived Tropospheric Temperature Trends to the Diurnal Cycle Adjustment" "Evidence for an earlier greenhouse cooling effect in the stratosphere before 1980 over the Northern Hemisphere" "Assessing atmospheric temperature data sets for climate studies" Surface warming: "Global Temperature in 2015" http://mahb.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/20160120_Temperature2015.pdf "On the definition and identifiability of the alleged “hiatus” in global warming" Surface warming / ocean warming: "Possible artifacts of data biases in the recent global surface warming hiatus" Ocean warming: “Assessing recent warming using instrumentally homogeneous sea surface temperature records” "A review of global ocean temperature observations: Implications for ocean heat content estimates and climate change" http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf ["Ocean warming dominates the increase in energy stored in the climate system, accounting for more than 90% of the energy accumulated between 1971 and 2010 (high confidence).[...] On a global scale, the ocean warming is largest near the surface, and the upper 75 m warmed by 0.11 [0.09 to 0.13] °C per decade over the period 1971 to 2010."] Energy balance: "The Earth's energy balance" [ http://lecuyer.aos.wisc.edu/publications/2015_stephens_lecuyer_EEB_ar.pdf ] "Anthropogenic and natural warming inferred from changes in Earth’s energy balance" "An update on Earth’s energy balance in light of the latest global observations" CO2 Radiative forcing: "Observational determination of surface radiative forcing by CO2 from 2000 to 2010" "Increases in greenhouse forcing inferred from the outgoing longwave radiation spectra of the Earth in 1970 and 1997" This has led to many scientists saying that there's been no "pause" or "hiatus" in global warming: "Has there been a hiatus?" "Debunking the climate hiatus" "Change points of global temperature" Michael Mann himself feels uncomfortable with the term "pause", since it leads to denialists pretending AGW has stopped, when it actually hasn't. Mann also admits that global warming has continued: "The rate at which the earth’s temperature has been rising eased slightly in the past decade, but temperature is still increasing; calling the slowdown a “pause” is false." http://www.meteo.psu.edu/holocene/public_html/Mann/articles/articles/MannSciAmApr14.pdf "Making sense of the early-2000s warming slowdown [...] We do not believe that warming has ceased [...] A point of agreement we have with Lewandowsky et al. 26 concerns the unfortunate way in which the recent changes have been framed in terms of GMST having “'stalled', 'stopped', 'paused', or entered a 'hiatus'”. Just exactly how such changes should be referred to is open to debate. Possible choices include 'reduced rate of warming', 'decadal fluctuation' or 'temporary slowdown' — all try to convey the primary mechanism involved, which in the recent example is likely to be internal decadal variability." https://courses.eas.ualberta.ca/eas570/warming_slowdown.pdf	UCWZGVxHPDNenYs5mkxjUwhA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWZGVxHPDNenYs5mkxjUwhA	1	Uggve9lva9zupHgCoAEC	Robert Johnson

I see nothing from him but gross generalizations, fundamental misunderstandings of science and logic, and insults, lots and *lots* insults. My first comment towards his childishness elicited a response that was, well, childish. And I feel kind of dumb in retrospect for only having pointed out the obvious. I'm just dealing in speculation but, I think he likes to mock and insult people on the internet as an outlet for his anger, or to attract the attention and human interaction he craves in his life, or some measure of both. Can't say for sure, you can't psychoanalyze somebody you've never met, but with each comment it seems more and more to be the case. Either way, it's bizarre. It's also possible he could just be a troll trying to discredit reasonable people who don't believe in climate change. One aspect that lends credence to this idea is his avatar mocking liberals; It's not often you see somebody whose avatar expresses their hatred of something, it's almost always either of themselves, somebody they love or something they admire. however that could also support the idea that this is a very angry individual. That's the internet for ya lol, it's a bit like a funhouse, but i digress now for fear of stooping to the level of diatribe and shit throwing.

This is the conclusion of virtually the entire scientific community, as supported by evidence and observation.  This of course is all conjecture and guesswork. Today's trend is cooling, that's the evidence. The laws of physics doesn't not say that slight warming of atmospheric gases makes up for the cooling influence of the sun.

I am going to grant all your statements as true without researching them, because in the end it does not matter if they are true or not. Everybody knows the climate has changed before, and everybody knows that it will change again with or without anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. This does not alter the fact that today's warming trend is anthropogenic, and that its continuation has major repercussions for the security of human civilization. This is the conclusion of virtually the entire scientific community, as supported by evidence and observation. Even if it were true that today's warming trend is only marginally anthropogenic, and that other forcings are the major driver today (this is not the conclusion supported by the evidence), still it would be urgent for us to begin rapidly scaling back our greenhouse gas emissions. We know this is true because the laws of physics are such that more atmospheric CO2 and CH4 means greater heat retention in the lower troposphere, such that any naturally-occurring warming trends will be amplified by these and other greenhouse gases. http://scied.ucar.edu/longcontent/greenhouse-effect	UCiDooMjuWYs3nrzjZ_4zlcA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiDooMjuWYs3nrzjZ_4zlcA	1	Uggve9lva9zupHgCoAEC	Robert Johnson

Ripples in the seabed on the north shore of Greenland made by wave action proves this was once open water. Canadians digging up dinosaur bones in the Arctic prove this was once a warmer planet. If you want the links to these empirical facts, let me know. You're a child and might not have heard of Google. This is empirical evidence that this planet is in a cold interglacial period.

When the facts and the evidence do not support a given position, it becomes necessary to attack the person behind the opposing position. Personal attacks are the lowest form of debate. It is the surest sign of a failed argument. http://fablegod.com/the-pyramid-of-debate/ What's even more amusing is that he's trying to goad me into responding in kind, as though I can be dragged away from facts and evidence and into a debased exchange of silly insinuations and insults. Facts and evidence stand on their own merits, however, and do not require ad hominem or name-calling to deliver their point. I'm happy for him to continue his behaviour, because it makes climate deniers look like troglodytes, which in turn casts reasonable people appear in a more favourable light. With each personal attack, he is furnishing the contrast between those who base their views on beliefs and bias, and those who base their views on critical thinking. He is in fact working against his own cause, and I'm positively delighted by it.	UCiDooMjuWYs3nrzjZ_4zlcA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiDooMjuWYs3nrzjZ_4zlcA	1	Uggve9lva9zupHgCoAEC	Robert Johnson

So you're a teeny bopper. okay I'll have to take your young age and fascination with non-reality into account. In actual reality, is there any other reality, the 30,000 members that you mention are the sane people not on the grant gravy train. The Space and Science Research Corporation has refused to use any of the US surface station data because it is just readings of the pavement at airports. Anyone who defaults to calling a realist a denier is showing childish behaviour and his ideas are not congruent with science. Science reality of course, there is no other science.

It contained several names of deceased individuals, proponents of intelligent design, veterinarians, mining prospectors, and many other unrelated fields. 0.1% of its signatories had any background in climatology at all, and even fewer had an advanced background. The petition was organized and published by the George C. Marshall Institute, which is funded by Exxon Mobil. The formatting of its publication plagiarized that of the National Academy of Sciences in order to manufacture an appearance of credibility. Its cover letter was authored by Fred Seitz, a big-tobacco lobbyist who argued that the carcinogenic effects of tobacco were not a settled science. There are not 30,000 members of the scientific community who reject the reality of anthropogenic climate change. In actual reality, where real things and events are happening, 97% of climate scientists identify anthropogenic causes as the primary source of present day warming. This real information comes from the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the group which saw its publication formatting plagiarized by the Oregon Petition. Because your ideas are unsupported by facts and evidence, you resort to the shill gambit and ad hominem fallacies. Because your ideas are not congruent with reality, you default to accusations and insults. It is the childish behaviour of someone who does not think or perceive correctly.

There were a handful of individuals borrowing methodologies from the Greeks.  When the Catholic Church attempted to suppress Galileo's findings, they did so with zero scientific background, zero scientific literacy, and zero evidence. Do not attempt to compare yourself to Galileo again. You are the opposite of Galileo. He was a brilliant scientist. You are scientifically illiterate. The entire scientific community agrees with virtual unanimity that the climate is changing, and that anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are the primary cause. If you disagree with this, you are wrong, because to disagree with reality as it actually exists is to be wrong. If someone thinks the Earth is flat, they are open to ridicule and disdain, because the Earth is not flat, it is round, and anyone who does not understand that it is round is hopelessly confused. By the same, if someone thinks present-day Earth is cooling, they are open to ridicule and disdain, because present-day Earth is warming, and anyone who does not understand that it is warming is hopelessly confused. You are hopelessly confused, and for that reason you should expect to receive ridicule and disdain.

The pope had the entire scientific community at his behest when he called Galileo a liar. Ignore this phoney "entire scientific community". Asking someone to back up their claim that the earth is flat is like asking someone to believe in anthropogenic climate change. Earth is round and is cooling. Check with Piers Corbyn. We know that when someone disagrees with the present global cooling that they are either retarded, stupid or more likely on the gravy train that Obama is the conductor of. It's not a shame if someone believes in the scam of global warming. And not a shame when they put the big jacket on them so they don't injure themselves during those delusion episodes.

Asking someone to "back up" their acknowledgement of anthropogenic climate change is like asking someone to "back up" their claim that Earth is round. If it is your contention that the findings of the entire scientific community are not reliable, it falls upon you to prove that claim. Asking him to disprove your contention is asking him to prove a negative, and is a logical fallacy thereby. In the course of incorrectly identifying an ad hominem (no such fallacy occurred), you deployed a logical fallacy of your own. This kind of rhetorical collapse is all too common among climate deniers, and indicates a deficit in critical thinking skills. Earth is round. Anthropogenic climate change is occurring. These statements are true, and do not require further debate. We know these statements are true because the evidence indicates they are true. When somebody disagrees with the evidence, they are incorrect, because their statements are not congruent with what's true.

To see that as plausible, and to conceive a handful of massively wealthy oil & gas companies investing in a PR campaign to exploit scientific illiteracy and generate distortion in the public conversation as somehow implausible -- it's baffling. Not only is there abundant evidence indicating this has actually occurred, it also has abundant historical precedent: business interests fought against medical science over tobacco, against materials science over leaded gasoline, against atmospheric science over CFCs, and so on and so forth. It's similar to the manner in which creationists deny evolution, decrying the evidence-supported facts as implausible, and then asserting that a magic ghost creating the universe in six days somehow qualifies as a plausible and satisfactory explanation for the origins of life. The confusion required to think along these lines is just astonishing. When it comes to evolution denial, very little harm comes from that belief alone. At worst, creationists will attempt to have that nonsense taught in public schools, and a generation of children will have their development delayed until they're older. When it comes to climate denial, however, a poorly educated and unaware population has major ramifications for the whole of civilization, an invites planet-wide economic, material, and human adversity that will persist well into the coming centuries. Beliefs have consequences. When the beliefs of large numbers of people cause them to reject climate science, it has serious consequences for today, tomorrow, and for generations to come. That is why I feel it's time to pass legislation against fraudulent science denial. When somebody denies scientific evidence in the media without furnishing equal or greater evidence to support their claims, and when it can be established they are doing this in the service of financial interests, it should be deemed an act of fraud and prosecuted according to the severity of its consequences.

Oil and gas has nothing to do with the trillions, not millions, supplied to the alarmists every year. Scientists do not unanimously agree on the causes of climate change other than recognizing that nature controls most of that. The scientists that say the sky is falling and it's our fault are all funded by the government and Tides Foundation and the likes. The only contribution from the oil industry has been to David Suzuki's foundation and David shares land with Kooteney Power another of those ogres who deal in oil and gas. Ryan you are paranoid, get off the drugs, move to Hudson Bay and get back to nature. You're living in the city, the sun is baking the pavement and frying your brain. The anthropogenic part is the effect of pavement, both through absorption of heat and the sewering of the rainwater which in open land cools the earth upon evaporation. If you're not going to move to Hudson Bay, at least borrow a bulldozer and get busy plowing up the pavement which is unnatural to Gaia. Tell the Pope what you're doing and he will bless your mission.

Any decrease in pH constitutes acidification, and any increase in pH constitutes alkalinization. While environments below neutral pH are correctly described as "acidic", and those above neutral pH are correctly described as "alkaline", it is not correct to say that a decrease in alkalinity is something different from an increase in acidity or vice versa. Ocean acidification describes any adjustment of ocean pH toward the lower end of the pH scale. As the oceans absorb more and more carbon dioxide emitted from fossil fuel consumption, a process correctly described as ocean acidification (i.e., a decrease in alkalinity) occurs. This acidification encourages the formation of carbonate ions, and this subtracts from the availability of calcium carbonate to calcifying species, disrupting their biology and the food chain as a necessary consequence. Ocean acidification means more CO2−3 and HCO3–, which necessarily means less CaCO3, and fewer numbers of those species dependent on it. http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/co2/story/What+is+Ocean+Acidification%3F Of course, linking to NOAA--a credible scientific institution--is not likely to elicit either your reading or understanding of factual information, because in your world any source which doesn't align with your views is part of the so-called conspiracy. Others who read this thread will witness the robust immunity toward facts that's endemic to climate deniers, however, and this will serve to further subtract from their already diminutive credibility. As for the desert/flooding analogy, it is plainly erroneous. The pH scale precisely describes the concentration or action potential of hydrogen ions in a given solution. The term "flooding" loosely relates to the saturation state of soil. There is no analogous relationship between soil saturation and solution neutrality. That you would suggest such a thing indicates a profound scientific illiteracy.	UCiDooMjuWYs3nrzjZ_4zlcA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiDooMjuWYs3nrzjZ_4zlcA	1	Uggve9lva9zupHgCoAEC	Robert Johnson

Check the news, the northern hemisphere is cooling. Please come back to reality where real things and events happen. Now for a little fun with you idiots. Study coral islands, like the Maldives. They are building airstrips and hotels from their base knowing that the ocean will replenish. Check that out. Coral islands will never drown, that's nature, that's fact, that's reality. They will always be about 6 feet above ocean level. Now let's address the alarmists misuse of the English language. Alarmists are saying that the oceans are becoming more acidic. On the pH scale, there are 3 separations: alkaline, neutral, and acidic, in that order. The oceans are now alkaline, very much so and the buffering will ensure that. The oceans cannot become more acidic until they become acidic and neutral has to occur first. The oceans cannot become more acidic because they are not acidic. How can something become more acidic when it's not acidic to begin with? Stupid alarmists fucking with the English language. What else is new?

If there were even a slight discordance between the findings and the reality, this would manifest as an upheaval in the scientific discourse. This upheaval just doesn't exist -- except from a handful of loud-mouthed contrarians, 100% of whom just happen to be on the payroll of the oil & gas industry and its vested interest in distorting public opinion about climate change. It is correct to point out that science is not a consensus-driven process. Science is an evidence-driven process. When the evidence is overwhelming, however, scientific consensus naturally orients around it. For example, the evidence indicates that life is evolving, and that random mutation plus natural selection is the primary cause. There is an overwhelming scientific consensus around this fact, because the evidence supporting it is proportionately overwhelming. Similarly, the evidence indicates the climate is changing, and that anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are the primary cause. There is an overwhelming scientific consensus around this fact because there is an overwhelming body of evidence to support it. When a consensus is supported by evidence, both the consensus and the evidence are extremely likely to be correct. The only voices arguing against evolution by natural selection are those with something to lose: those receiving tax-free cash donations (i.e., government subsidized income) from congregations. The only voices arguing against climate change by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are those with something to lose: the corporations receiving massive government subsidies for oil & gas development, not to mention the massive profits accrued from the ongoing extraction and consumption of fossil fuels.

Most climate scientists make between $30,000 and $90,000 a year. Most oil executives draw salaries and bonuses in the tens of millions. Which of these two groups does she think has superior means and motive to manipulate popular perception about climate science? Furthermore, climate scientists would still have jobs even if anthropogenic climate change was not occurring. Understanding the climate and its many complexities is a field of study which does not require a crisis to be important. It helps us with agriculture, weather forecasting, natural disaster preparedness, efficiency in trade and travel, and so on and so forth. People would be making their living off climate science with or without abrupt climate change. If you mom is the sort of person who is addicted to conspiracy theories, ask her to evaluate which conspiracy theory is more likely: that tens of thousands of climate scientists have been wrangled into falsifying over a century of data as part of an intergenerational conspiracy to bilk the government out of a few million in grants, or that the world's fossil fuel companies--which own trillions of dollars in assets--have invested a tiny portion of their wealth over the past few years to distort public opinion about a problem which threatens the future value of their assets? Perhaps remind her that large financial interests opposed the science connecting tobacco to lung cancer, leaded gasoline to health consequences, CFCs to ozone depletion, and virtually every other scientific insight which threatened bottom lines over the past 200 years. It has enormous historical precedent. Global scientific conspiracies, on the other hand, simply do not.

So again, you take the instrumental record (e.g. GISTEMP), and look at all the 15-year trends (or 10-year, whatever you prefer). Put them in a chart. You'll see they are not random, so it's possible to draw conclusions about them and make predictions, such as "we're getting out of a short-term minimum."

Furthermore you can't possible know from looking at current data if we're "getting out of a short term minimum". To anyone who actually understands raw data collection and statistical analysis it's obvious you're either talking out of your ass or parroting someone who was. From current data trends we can only tell what has happened and the trends of previous data... you can't know for certain the future data... Despite the fact that this "25 year warming period" has been on hiatus 15 years, 5 years longer than the supposed warming trend, people still believe the world is going to end or something lol. The only thing constant about the Earth's climate is that it keeps changing.	UCzbdDW_icBVgyNsriBXtsRg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzbdDW_icBVgyNsriBXtsRg	1	Uggve9lva9zupHgCoAEC	Robert Johnson

But that's meaningless. Imagine that I said the trend in the last 3 years is not statistically significant. Of course it isn't. There's too much noise. 15 years is still not a whole lot. The right way to analyze this is to look at 10- or 15-year trends across the entire record, and see how they change. What you'll see is that they fluctuate -- they are cyclical -- but generally above zero, and we're currently getting out of a short-term minimum.

A 15 year "leveling off" (temperatures have actually gone up ever so slight) is no indication that warming has stopped. Warming could begin again as it apparently has with 2014 being the hottest year on record or cooling could start. It's just impossible to tell with such a short timeframe.

The US Navy knew for decades that the arctic ice was getting thinner because they measured it so they could figure our where to surface their nuclear subs. It was considered a national security issue so their results were not shared with scientists. If this data had been shared we would have realize decades earlier what effect climate change was causing.

". The reason they changed it was because people were expecting this meant it would warm all over the globe and people were doing the hey it's cold here what happened to climate change. They (I think it was the IPCC) actually put out a statement to this effect and it made news briefly. I'm old enough to remember when it happened. When you are this far of about a very basic fact you really need better sources of information probably on a lot of things but that's a whole other kettle of worms. I've argued with people about climate change the age of the earth etc. and people generally have a litany of false arguments. It's exhausting and not my responsibility. When you make a statement as ignorant as what you just did it's you're responsibility to admit you have some serious issues with research and actually read what the scientist say and the responses to the most common criticisms instead of just the criticisms. This it is best to start out with a basic trust in scientific consensus. Because they actually are researchers and there is literally paid lobbyist and politicians to muddy the waters almost all topics of economic interest.

Antarctic sea ice COVER is increasing, but it is formed by thinner sea ice, so the actual VOLUME of ice is decreasing - Antarctic is losing ice at 118 billion tons per year. And even in area, while the Antarctic gained about 0.5 million sq km of ice cover, the Arctic lost 3 million sq km.

My first comment on this thread pointed out that your counterargument to the original comment didn't actually contain pertenant information. My point was that information about Arctic ice decreasing (which you posted) cannot be used to negate the argument that increasing Antarctic ice disproves climate change. " you realize that the arctic and antarctic are two different things right? Antarctic ice can increase just as arctic ice can decrease." Marcello implores us to remember that "Antarctic is not the only ice sheet." Maybe saying the argument is identical was wrong, but I'm sure you see the similarities. Since you're here, why not respond to the last questions I had asked you? Unless this is you "desperately" trying to avoid it..

Overall the Earth is losing sea ice at a rate of 35,000 sq km per year (13,514 sq miles). “Not every location on the Earth is having the same responses to climate changes. The fact that ice in one part of the world is doing one thing and in another part ice is doing another is not surprising. The Earth is large and as the climate changes it is normal to see different things going on,” says Parkinson." did you even read the article?

Both the rate and underlying reasons it is changing now present a concern when you look toward the future. So "it's changed in the past" doesn't take into account why the current situation is concerning. No one disagrees that CO2 is a small part of the atmosphere, either. That doesn't forego an effect; temperature changes due to GHGs are subject to a positive feedback loop that magnifies their effect. In other words, everything you're saying is already being taken into account by those with whom you disagree.

The Antarctic is mostly land covered in ice surrounded by ocean. The Arctic has a regular freezing thawing cycle because the ice is in direct contact with the ocean. The Antarctic had a much smaller version of the thawing freezing cycle until the climate started changing at an increased rate. Fresh melt water ran into the southern ocean lowering relative salinity just a little and as you know fresher water freezes at a higher temperature than salty water. So in the Antarctic winter the less saltier surface water froze in larger area's because of the melting the previous summer. It took the scientists a little by surprise until they figured out what was happening and why. The extra Antarctic ice in no way invalidates the overwhelming evidence for CO2 driven climate change. In fact when you understand how it happens the extra ice actually reinforces the theory.

From a study looking at satellite data over Greenland since 1979 a gradual warming leading to melting is observed but in 2012 an unusual maybe El Nino type warm year sparked or fed fears and then the next year it was colder than had been in over a decade. It doesn't add up that steady dramatic emissions equal steady dramatic weather changes at this point. We didn't ever stop or slowdown economies or population but the weather is warm or cold depending on factors not being discussed or understood. I won't ask people to base they're life on carbon tax or fear induced manipulation to support this movement over "real" problems. It's back to common sense, and using our best knowledge and best practice to proceed humanity in a responsible manner in relation to respect for all life. If anything curbing consumption of certain goods will make a world of difference. Livestock and by-products, disposable goods, that sort of thing.

The problem with the passive approach that you appear to advocate is that often not much happens. Its been 25 years since Kyoto and in that time frame our actions have gotten worse, not better. Statements like "climate change is inevitable", while true or not, only serve to reinforce the belief that whatever is going to happen is going to happen. So why change what we're doing unless there's a profit in it. It reinforces the belief that human action has no effect. And that's the problem. Because its wrong. Our actions are the cause of global warming. And if we wait, then were screwed. We might already be screwed because we waited to long. This isn't something that we can all of a sudden fix. We should have been changing our behaviour years ago, but we didn't. But that shouldn't prevent us from trying to change our behaviour now. The longer we wait though, the worse the repercussions.

As it is, the reaction to climate change has been one of negativity and opportunity through inconvenience. I believe a better path forward would be to observe beneficial changes to make in adjusting to the ever changing climate in developed nations, then advocating those changes down to lesser developed countries. The problem with stopping or solving climate change is that it cannot be stopped or solved, because it is ever occurring since the beginning of  climates themselves. A motive spread in greed is greatly more powerful than fear in my opinion, and in my opinion, if marketed properly would be much more effective in achieving the kind of results the fear campaign has sought after. Climate change is inevitable. The degree to which it changes can be manipulated through greed in the right direction. Much easier to convince than fear. Especially so, when not everybody shares the same fear, as  evidenced by the fact of deniers, corporate interests, and subtle disagreement on cause variations. Even the producers of "It's Okay To Be Smart" could not mount an argument proper enough to quell dissident on climate change through the fear motive. Clearly there is a difference of viewpoint on rationale. If they would only approach the issue in a different direction, this would not be such a big issue as it is. It is not only the United States suffering from climate change denial, which is also a troublesome matter, since the USA isn't the only place being dramatically affected by it. So clearly, the message is not working through fear. But go ahead and keep believing that it is the most effective. You will be correct eventually. Just too late for it to matter...

We need to find solutions, both economically, and socially. We have to get off whatever we think is contributing, how ever severe, or slight. We have to replace it with something safer. We need to be very aware and self conscious of the people around us and how they are already going to have to deal with the effects, whether we reverse course or not. We need to consider preparing towns and cities for new types of agriculture and infrastructure to handle the changing weather. Postulating on prevention alone is a fools errand. If it is too late to stop any hand we had in it, we are better to be read to face the consequences. A good warning to serve us, should be the calamity that has befallen thus far through mudslides, floods, famines, and sea level rises of various countries around the world. We should start working on relocations, sea walls, changes to irrigation, and plans for emergency, all in addition to any attempt to curb the effects we suspect we have on the climate. Our attempts to phase out fossil fuels should be driven by passion for innovation, not fear. Fear slows things down, and even causes us to make mistakes. This is no time to be afraid. That comes later.	UC3o5bP-qQwUDVq9HzIIpVlQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3o5bP-qQwUDVq9HzIIpVlQ	1	UggmusEjA3Ik1ngCoAEC	Juan Valadez

Most of the presenters do not take a stance on what cause the westerlies except for "C02 and reduced ozone appear correlated (in some unnamed percentage) to change in winds but the article does offer one rebutle that can also not be disproved that "this is all a natural process" My thought is that I believe in the past with rampant cfc's and aerosols we had less ozone but also less warm temperatures and also had less C02 but temperatures from 1900 on rise steadily. One article from CIRES stated that "the ozone hole over Antarctica is likely to show signs of recovery within the next decade." using data from 2013.

The fact is that while the extent of the antarctic sea ice has been increasing, the total amount of antarctic sea ice and glacial ice has been decreasing. What this means is that the ice is considerably thinner. Its also forming later in the season and melting earlier, which among other things has a dramatic effect on the marine ecology that is dependent on the ice, as well as the animals dependent on the animals dependent on the ice.

Do you agree that melting sea ice does not directly affect sea level rise in the same way that melting ice cubes does not raise the water line in a glass of water? I agree that increased heat in our atmosphere expands water—I don't deny that. However, the point that I'm trying to convey is that meltwater from sea ice does not contribute directly to sea level rise because it exists by nature in the water. On the other hand, ice on land that gets added to the ocean will increase sea level.

Species will be forced to either adapt to the changes in climate and environment as they happen, or they will die off and other species will adapt to fill their niche. Your fish tank example was a fairly good demonstration of this except for one small detail; the human species is inside the proverbial fish tank. We're aren't an outside observer and changes to the fish tank directly impact us. Nature as a whole will adapt to it's new environment, but it is under no obligation to make sure humans make the cut.

Maybe we're just slightly contributing to it, or its just a normal cycle, just more extreme than usual. Regardless, we should treat as if we're the main cause, because if we really are ruining our planet the consequences are VERY high, and if its just a normal cycle and everything sorts out on its own, it wont hurt us. This bet you are making, might lead to heavy consequences, so its safer to be cautious and approach it as if the climate change is real.

No events or facts will disprove this theory as the theory will simply change to become consistent with new data and speculation. CO dissipates so that's not really going to be an issue long term as fossil fuels will run out sooner rather than later. Moreover, there is way more vegetation on this planet now than ever before as humans bend over backwards preventing forests from burning down. Plants absorb CO. This whole concept has turned into a belief system which is why I opt out of "following" the theory. There are way to many variables to actually create a theory that will be anything close to true. Perhaps if everything was observed for about 300 million years I would consider simply believing a theory on this.  For now, I just look at facts and any obvious correlations. For example, CO from emissions and CO being absorbed by the ocean is a huge deal. The video was misleading as anything above a PH of 7 is not considered acidic. However, changes in the equilibrium throws everything off. In the end it wont matter. Just like a fish tank, when something is changed it throws the balance off but then it adapts. You add a plant then the plant absorbs nitrates ammonia and CO. In this case algae may die off but fish may be more healthy. You add a bubbler, then it moves water to much at the surface causing CO to dissipate then the plant may die and nitrates and ammonia may go up causing a fish to die then a huge ammonia spike causing a bacteria bloom and you have cloudy water. If you do nothing, it sorts itself out.  Anyway, my whole point is, within this theory they have lots of neat little correlations. Like the CO type from emissions from fossil fuels from plant matter. But that's all it is. There are way to many variables to connect little correlations with other little correlations. All murderers eat plant and/or animal mater. The plants and animals have very little correlation with the actual murders. Some but very little and changing those variables probably wont change the outcome. I eat plants and animals, I never murdered. BTW, one thing that is consistent is cooling periods. Not the time between them but the pattern that lead up to them. Id buy a jacket as 2016 will be the beginning of the next cooling period. (I bet someone takes credit for this by saying they cut emissions or something supporting climate change theory). Its all a sham.	UCOEJ7nFUzlmQJYOHFhHls5Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOEJ7nFUzlmQJYOHFhHls5Q	1	UggmusEjA3Ik1ngCoAEC	Juan Valadez

"Debunking the climate hiatus" "Change points of global temperature" Michael Mann himself feels uncomfortable with the term "pause", since it leads to denialists pretending AGW has stopped, when it actually hasn't. Mann also admits that global warming has continued: "The rate at which the earth’s temperature has been rising eased slightly in the past decade, but temperature is still increasing; calling the slowdown a “pause” is false." http://www.meteo.psu.edu/holocene/public_html/Mann/articles/articles/MannSciAmApr14.pdf "Making sense of the early-2000s warming slowdown [...] We do not believe that warming has ceased [...] A point of agreement we have with Lewandowsky et al. 26 concerns the unfortunate way in which the recent changes have been framed in terms of GMST having “'stalled', 'stopped', 'paused', or entered a 'hiatus'”. Just exactly how such changes should be referred to is open to debate. Possible choices include 'reduced rate of warming', 'decadal fluctuation' or 'temporary slowdown' — all try to convey the primary mechanism involved, which in the recent example is likely to be internal decadal variability." https://courses.eas.ualberta.ca/eas570/warming_slowdown.pdf	UCWZGVxHPDNenYs5mkxjUwhA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWZGVxHPDNenYs5mkxjUwhA	1	UgiC0WS4fmqwJHgCoAEC	Calvin CS

But saying 13 of the hottest years is correct but is misleading. Its talking about a plateau. If You look at there graph you can see that around mid 1990, ti'll the data recorded on there 2010, there has been no rise, there has been no trend. Its essentially saying same thing Calvin said on being the hottest. Yes they have, but its not Rising. its a plateau, theres no trend. Notice the scale too, were talking fractions of a degree. No one can perceive Fractions of a degree, so saying far hotter would also be misleading. Nothing of this is unusual considering earths history.

Considering earth climate gets hotter and colder by natural means there's nothing to suggest man has caused this. So it can only be caused by greenhouse gases? Again non sense. Furthermore the pause in warming, and yes pause because there is not even a small discernible warming, of the last 18 years or so while CO2 continues to increase. Points that climate is not as sensitive to CO2 otherwise there would be a continued warming trend. Anything to suggest its an anomaly is just a theory, and furthermore highly, highly unlikely. You dont see 18 year anomalies while trying to pin warming on CO2 even though its rising. Its inconsistency points to a far lesser climate sensitivity, to the point if any warming at all has been induced by it. The halocene period around 7,000 years ago has seen 2+c warmer than today which would put on average 1c over the proposed limit. So the earth has experienced it naturally. As it stands now the climate isn't doing anything or showing any trends. So any alarmist position stands on just speculation and not on hard science.

And the only cause that we have observed that could account for this is the increased emissions of greenhouse gasses.

CO2 can trap heat very easily, second only to methane. So, if you claim that data supports the idea that 444ppm of CO2 won't have an affect on our climate (almost as high as the Carboniferous Period), then you're out of your damn mind. Also, your use of theory to suggest that it is unsupported tells me that you don't understand what a theory is. Climate Change is not a theory. It is a phenomenon. A theory is a scientific statement drawn from the vast majority of data that answers a wide range of scientific questions that is testable and is supported by data. An example of a theory is "Human Activity is causing a large amount of Climate change.". This is supported by the data, as we see that CO2 in the atmosphere is trapping huge quantities of heat, and we are the only ones producing enough CO2 to explain the amount in the atmosphere. It answers a lot of questions, the largest of which is "Why is the planet getting hotter" (by the way, the last 3 decades were the hottest on record. Every year for the past 10 years has been hotter than the last. Before you bring up your beloved 18 year pause, that pause doesn't mean no rise in climate, it means far less than the previous years. A small rise in temperature over 18 years is still a rise). So before you make such wild claims, do your goddamn research.

The data in the 18 years shows no trend. Meaning you cant take anything from it to back up your claims. So there is no data to back up CO2 sensitivity to being anything dire. What the data is showing is that climate sensitivity to CO2 is not what has been claimed by global warming movement. So if its happened in the past how is it only explained by what man has done? Again non sense. And you say rate... what rate? Lol. So let me get this straight. The data shows that climate is not sensitive to CO2 yet all you have is theories as to why the data doesn't show that. And again theories, because there is no data that will back up the claim of climate CO2 sensitivity.

And I'm not arguing that the world has heated more or less than 1.5. I'm saying 1.5 is a huge deal. It is within acceptable levels, but at current rates, we'll be well outside acceptable climate change within 20 years. The Earth was indeed warmer back during the Middle Ages. However, that was likely due to increased solar output. There isn't an increased solar output in modern times. In fact, the sun has been decreasing in output for the past 50 years. 1.5 degrees is definitely a big deal. Especially given that global warming is exponential, not linear, meaning that the rate at which the temperature is rising is constantly increasing. If you disagree with me, then you disagree with 97% of all scientists. You're definitely wrong.

The peak of the Ice Age was only around 5  degrees colder on average. Saying 1.5 degrees isn't a problem at all is absolutely retarded.  And as to whether or not it is caused by humans, there aren't any scientists who will claim we haven't put megatons of CO2 into the atmosphere. That much CO2 is able to trap an unbelievable amount of heat, as it is a greenhouse gas. With no other culprits available, this appears to be the cause of the catastrophic 1.5 degree rise, and I say catastrophic 1.5 degrees without any amount of sarcasm.

This is no way implies man is responsible for these changes and even so how much change do you expect? Mild? catastrophic? Insignificant? None? And your definitely wrong in saying Far higher. Its has risen .85c about 1.5 Fahrenheit average for the last 100 years. Which is equivalent to no problem at all. And there is no evidence to say man is responsible for that. Considering earth climate record shows its within natural variability. I suspect CO2 has some impact on climate, but defiantly nowhere near the catastrophe that is painted out to be. So from what I have gathered and seen so far the whole global warming movement is political more than anything.

These anomalies occur pretty frequently during any climate trend, and can be due to anything from variable solar output to a decrease in volcanic eruptions and to wind currents, and any number of factors. The fact is that human CO2 output is higher now than it has ever been, and even though the climate hasn't risen as dramatically as before for 17 years, we still have far higher temperatures now compared to 30 years ago. The pause in global warming is simply a temporary plateau that could be due to any number of reasons, and doesn't change the overall global trend.

We don&#39;t have any global temperature measurements before, at best, the 1980s. No one has any accurate global temperature measurements before that time, so any assertion to that effect is completely wrong. My proof? Well, if you can find the temperature measurements in Perth, Australia from the 1800s, let me know. <br />In addition, the video makes no mention of the &quot;Little Ice Age&quot; which occurred from the 1600s and ended in the 1900s. So, when your measurement starting point is low, then it is not surprising that you will see a general rise. <br />Even the C12 versus C13 is bogus. Why? Because almost 99% of all carbon on Earth is C12. Thus, it&#39;s not surprising that you find C12 in the atmosphere.

At the end of the last ice age CO2 came in at 180 ppm due to a combinaton of ocean absorbtion and world wide sequestration in the form of limestone due to carbonaceous sea creatures and other natural processes.. This is barely sufficient for growth in land based plants. Below 150 ppm such plants will all become extinct. CO2 is essential for life on earth. The recent increase has resulted in an overall greening of the planet (e. g., western Australia). This is a very good thing which will lead to increased speciation. Sea level rise will be 5 to 10 cm, not 1 m. Check the experts on this one. Other claims are dogma, not science.

You do not care if your scale has an ofset of 10 or 10000, as long as the measurement of change is correct, it does not matter if your scale "thinks" that 0.000g is 10kg, as long as it outputs 0.000g, and out put the right change in mass. That is how you calibrate. This would relate to thermostats also, yes to different thermostats may measure 14 and 15 degrees C, if your only interested in the change, both will be correct in measuring a 2 degree difference if the numbers are 16 and 17 degree celcius.

The evidence indicates that the climate is changing, and that anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are the primary cause. The evidence also indicates that the only points of view differing from this position are politically and financially connected to the oil & gas industry. Furthermore, there is no evidence of a global socialist conspiracy to consolidate world power under a carbon dictatorship. When we inform our views according to the best evidence, we always make the best decisions. That is, in my opinion, what needs to come across in this discussion, and all other discussions of this sort.

UgihRl2Mjir8eHgCoAEC.8-pWGjZjrPW70nuGBPlkIH		2	2015-07-08 20:41:34	Ryan M	@Brian Stuart  You should stop listening to news agencies--reputable or not--because news agencies are not peer-reviewed scientific publications. You should start listening to peer-reviewed scientific publications because that is where real information is found. The world's peer-reviewed scientific publications agree with virtual unanimity that the climate is changing, and that anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are the primary cause. That is how things are in reality. NOAA and other scientific organizations adjust their figures according to the data. As new data comes in, it is incorporated into the broader analysis, returning new figures for publication. As this scientific process carries on, our insight into climate systems increases in sophistication, and our understanding of their behaviour becomes more certain. Utilizing this data, i.e., evidence, the conclusion of NOAA and all other major scientific organizations is that the climate is changing, and that anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are the primary cause. That is how things are in reality. Arctic ice is declining. Record lows are recorded year over year, and have been for decades. The process is not linear--some years will see more ice recovery in the winter, and less ice loss in the summer--but the overall trend remains down. Because of this reality, an ice-free Arctic in the summer is not only expected, but inevitable. That is how things are in reality. Over and over again, the predictions of climatologists are proven correct, or they are proven to be underestimations as opposed to overestimations. Projections in CO2 concentration and its correspondent temperature rise have closely paralleled observations. Projections in Arctic sea ice decline fell far short of observations. Most notably, observed sea level rise between 1993 and 2007 far exceeded projections rendered by the 1995 and 2001 IPCC synthesis reports. If anything, the scientific community has been too conservative in their projections, and the climate is changing more abruptly than they anticipated. That is how things are in reality. The bottom line is this. If we fail to act on climate change, hundreds of millions of people will be displaced, and hundreds of thousands will die. Food and water security will collapse in many parts of the world, and enormous populations will suffer under it. Conflicts will erupt as a result. If we do act on climate change, and if we do implement carbon neutral technologies which already exist and can be deployed at once, we can solve our energy problems without depriving anyone of anything, instead increasing the security of people around the globe. That is how things are in reality. All of this as a response to a proven fact: anthropogenic climate change. You, in your ignorance and bias, would have us ignore the facts, to embrace industry rhetoric, and to idle on the most pressing issue of our time. It's because of your line of thinking that there is a disagreement between public opinion and scientific evidence, and it's because of this disagreement that much needed action remains idle. That is how things are in reality. Make no mistake: you are on the wrong side of history. Every time large financial interests have tried to fight scientific evidence, they have failed, and the consequences of their distortion has been human security, life and liberty. That is how things are in reality.	UCiDooMjuWYs3nrzjZ_4zlcA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiDooMjuWYs3nrzjZ_4zlcA	1	UgihRl2Mjir8eHgCoAEC	Brian Stuart
UgihRl2Mjir8eHgCoAEC.8-pWGjZjrPW70npro3xykt		3	2015-07-08 20:03:09	Zeupater	@Brian Stuart Actually, we do have long-term global data. You're right in one way; we have better instruments now than before 1979 and before we relied on ground stations. But all the new ways of measuring , including satellite data (and learning to reconcile it with ground data) and paleoclimatology show that global temperatures have steadily climbed since the Industrial Revolution, and the three warmest decades on record are, in order, the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. Don't be surprised if 2010s are a new record. The video also referenced data since well before the last major ice age (about 125,000 years ago) and indeed referenced data going back 800,000 years. This easily encompasses the Little Ice Age, also known as the 1600s. Also, yes C12 is the most abundant Carbon isotope, but that is not what the video is saying. C12 and C13 are the two most stable carbon isotopes so they are the easiest to use in earth science. They can even used to measure and identify the presence of ancient and more unstable carbon deposits, such as C3 and C4, showing the kind of environment it was created in. The amount (C12 is about 98%, C13 is a little more than 1%) is not what is in question, but the proportions in the atmosphere. And yes, C12 levels, normally stable, are rising. No single data point establishes global climate change. It's the agreement of the various models, the different ways we measure climate data from atmospheric radiation, hydrology, oceanography, paleoclimateology, organic chemistry, fluid dynamics and yes, historical meterological data.

Why would I do that?  As to the facts being uncertain, is that why NOAA is constantly "adjusts" its numbers? Because those numbers are "certain?" Sorry, that dog ain't gonna hunt.  Yes, real things have happened (or more accurately, not happened). For example, the Arctic is supposed to be free of ice. What happened? It still has ice. We weren't supposed to get snow in Washington, DC. Woops. We're supposed to have more hurricanes. Hmmm. We seem to have fewer.  Over and over again, the predictions of the climatistas fail. Yet, we keep hearing that something dire is coming. Sure, okay.  Bottom line for me on this issue is simple. If we implement all the things the climatistas want, people will die. We simply cannot produce sufficient goods to keep people healthy. Poor people will suffer the most as they won't be able to afford electricity or gas to cook food or keep food fresh.  All this for a hypothesis that has yet to be proven.

The predictions and models are coming true and most of you climatistas cannot explain things like the pause or the increase in ice in the Antarctic. Then, as I pointed out, we have the NOAA fudging the data to make things work.  Your so called "97%" has been debunked over and over, to the point that it's a punch line. The Wall Street Journal ran and expose on this and it's clear that the 97% is faked and circular.  Also, consensus isn't science. The Steady State Universe was the consensus until about 1961. Even Einstein believed in it.  Lastly, I must point out since you're making the claim, you have to prove it correct, which you cannot. I don't prove it incorrect.  Nonetheless, it is clear that you bought into the dogma and regard it as a religious truth, like the firmament of the Earth.  Good luck with that religious dogma. 	UCCRO1_-tVlEWLD-l4u3fepQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCRO1_-tVlEWLD-l4u3fepQ	1	UgihRl2Mjir8eHgCoAEC	Brian Stuart

My opinion doesn't matter. Your opinion doesn't matter. The facts and the evidence matter. The facts and the evidence indicate that the climate is changing, and that anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are the primary cause. When you disagree with the facts and the evidence, you are wrong, because the facts and the evidence are true regardless of your private perceptions. In actual reality, where real things and events happen, 97% peer-reviewed scientific publications taking a position on climate change acknowledge anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions as the primary cause. The number of publications aligned against this position has never exceeded 0.2%. If you disagree with this, you are wrong, because to disagree with what's true is to be wrong. Meteorologists are not required to take a course in climate change. Understanding climate change is not part of the NOAA/NWS certification requirements, and university programs do not require any relevant coursework. The opinion of meteorologists thereby doesn't matter. These people are weathermen; they understand cloud dynamics and pressure systems, and they predict local weather. They are not authorities on climate science. If you think they are authorities on climate science, you are confused. Claims made against the overwhelming body of meticulously gathered evidence must be substantiated by equal or greater evidence. When it comes to climate change, this evidence is not forthcoming. It is certainly not forthcoming from you. That's just how things are.	UCiDooMjuWYs3nrzjZ_4zlcA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiDooMjuWYs3nrzjZ_4zlcA	1	UgihRl2Mjir8eHgCoAEC	Brian Stuart

According to you, there is no room for disagreement. To illustrate how this is both arrogant and ignorant, let me provide an example. We have developed nuclear bombs and power plants based on Einstein's theory of special relativity. Yet, there are scientists who are right now trying to disprove it. That's how science works. Not with your blinkered view that no one should ever disagree with you.  Now, you assert that no "qualified" scientist disagrees with you. Despite the fact that the predictions based on your theory have not to pass (hey, look, there's ice in the Arctic), no one can explain the relatively lack of increase in global temperatures for the past decade, and the fact that it's been shown that supporters have repeatedly fudged data to get the results they want.  Lastly, before you start blathering about 97%, the American Meteorological Society conducted a survey of it's members. Only 39% agreed with your hypothesis. I suppose the 61% of the AMS are "unqualified."  You express a typical view of those who follow a dogma. Rather than enter a reasoned debate, anyone who disagrees with you must be a heretic.

That's how science works.  When they build nuclear power plants, they don't just "get an idea" of calibrations. They are exact. When astronomers talk about stars, they try to get as precise as possible.  Yet, you're saying that this doesn't have to be accurate? Why?

What matters is the changes from day to day, month to month. These are matched across many stations. You can get an idea of the Earth's temperature (~ 14 C) from station data, but that's not precise by any means. However, a 1C *rise* from a *reference* is quite precise. How do I know this? (I've done this, btw.) You can sample half the stations, and do the analysis, then repeat with the other half. The match will be very precise.

As I recall it's no more than -0.2C/century. The trend in the last 40 years is about 1.5C/century. What we're seeing is about an order of magnitude faster than a typical natural shift in the climate. Indeed, I could easily hypothesize that the "little" part of the little ice age is an anthropogenic result.

If there had been, then the emerging scientific theory would have demonstrable prediction and projection of future events within justifiable limits of uncertainty. Like all folks on the extreme left when there is disagreement or debate, the left resorts to labeling (e.g. deniers). Unfortunately, the pursuit of understanding the factors affecting changes in the earth&#39;s climate is hindered by the unwillingness to honestly investigate, discuss, and challenge the findings and conclusions within a framework that is free (as much as possible) of bias.

Over centuries or millenia, we observe periodic climate changes. Science is the product of detailed technical monitoring, study and analysis. Science concludes only what it proves beyond scientific challenge, and still makes errors. Science is never a matter of opinion, consensus or debate. Models project by extrapolation, which increases the error factors.	UC0nIpYV841G-IjfVNaAst7w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0nIpYV841G-IjfVNaAst7w	0

And closer together! I kid you not, two weeks ago we had an end-of-summer wildfire so close to my town we had trouble with coughing and stinging eyes for a week...and as I write this, it&#39;s been raining all night and _there is frost vapor on my window_.<br /><br />IT&#39;S NOT EVEN OCTOBER YET!<br />I mean, sure, this doesn&#39;t mean that every day from now on is just gonna get colder and colder, but c&#39;mon, frost on the windows only a WEEK after the last SUMMER wildfire finally got under control? Even in a quickly-changing-weather biome like a desert (we had an Arizona-like summer this year, too) or mountain (&quot;Greatest Snow on Earth!&quot;--don&#39;t look at me like that. It&#39;s a phrase on our license plates) doesn&#39;t normally change THAT fast.<br /><br />Summer this year contained like two weeks in a row where the high of the day didn&#39;t fall below 100 (Fahrenheit, I&#39;m an American and this is about a place in America--I&#39;m not saying it was literally BOILING! :P) and yet I feel fairly certain that winter this year will do similarly as it did last year, after a just-as-hot summer: contain entire weeks where the high of the day doesn&#39;t break into two digits. (For you metric users: That&#39;s DEFINITELY colder than 0 C.) It seems odd (and kinda unfair) to have both hot summers AND cold winters; you&#39;d think that the warmer summers would mean milder winters or the colder winters would mean cooler summers. NOPE! <br /><br />I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is that I have empirical evidence, gathered from my own real-life experience of living in the same place for decades, that SOMEthing funky is going on with the weather. And if it&#39;s not us? As many below me have said, couldn&#39;t hurt to switch to renewables as soon as comfortably and profitably possible anyway.

The CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is thus irrelevant to the greenhouse effect, because its concentration in the atmosphere doesn&#39;t affect the intensity of such effect.

In short, due to the crystal structure of the solid phase of water, the molecules arrange themselves in a rigid, ordered fashion and end up being, on average, farther apart from each other (than they are in the liquid phase), and thus less dense. Ice bergs float because of buoyancy.	UCAI3SvH-Wjn0jFs3JpjxBHg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAI3SvH-Wjn0jFs3JpjxBHg	1	UgxJ-T7G53gYgwm3oXR4AaABAg	Andrew Janssen

Many Production Companies Has To Be Stopped<br /><br />We manufacture so many products and it is creating pollution and pollution has increased to such an extent that it has become a threat to the world. So if we can minimise our products, pollution would be less.<br />We produce so many things which we do not need as a necessity, like cold drinks, leather products, potato wafers, chips, fruit juices, chocolates, biscuits, pickles, ice creams, etc. Cold drinks, fruit juices, chocolates, biscuits, pickles, ice creams, etc. should be cooked at home only. Instead of cold drinks people should drink natural drinks such as lime water, coconut water or just any fruit, not any fruit juice, just the whole fruit which can be prepared or served when a customer comes in a shop, hotel or a person selling this drinks on a street and serve it to him. If we stopped producing this things so much pollution could be reduced. Also these companies need so much water and electricity, we could give that water and electricity to places where water and electricity supply is less. As the world is facing pollution problems, we should stop producing things which is not a necessity for humans. In this way we would create less pollution. What about the companies that are going to be stopped, they would have debts to pay. The companies which cannot pay the debts just excuse them. We will think that if companies are going to be shut down then how the Industrialists and so many people who would lose their jobs, how will they survive. Well companies and people&#39;s on one side and the earth on one side, which should we save, the earth is more important.<br /><br />2. We Should Cook Foods In Its Natural Form<br /><br />We can cook rice and wheat in our homes and eat it. Rice and Wheat is produced in farms. Then it is packed and transported to big warehouses, then wholesalers buy from them and supply to retail shops. <br />But if a manufacturing company makes bread from rice and wheat, then to make bread a manufacturing company has to be set up, machines and working staffs are needed. When a company is built many other things are also needed. Then at last a plastic pack is required to pack the breads.<br />So if we start cooking eatable things in its natural form then we do not need many companies like bread manufacturing company, tomato ketchup, fruit jam, pizza, burger, etc., the things required for the company and the plastic pack, paper box pack and glass bottles. If done like this, so many companies will not be required and hence less pollution for the world.<br />This must be done. The World is researching on how to clear the earth&#39;s pollution, but if we stopped many companies like bread manufacturing company and others which are not required as a necessity, so much pollution could be reduced and maybe we won&#39;t even have to research on how to clear the earth&#39;s pollution.<br /><br />3. Pickles should not be stored<br /><br />Most of the people buy pickles to eat, while some make it at home. If pickles are bought from a store then a company has also to make glass bottles to store the pickles. If made at home then still glass bottles are required to store the pickles. <br />But if we make pickles at home and only cook how much is needed for one time then we won&#39;t need glass bottles to store the pickles. Glass bottles when manufactured it creates water pollution.<br /><br />4. We Should Stop Using Makeup Products<br /><br />Many women&#39;s all over the world do makeup. Makeup is not a necessity for humans. Instead of doing makeup to look beautiful, women&#39;s should do exercise daily. If they exercise and sweat, eat fruits daily, they would have less dead skins and be naturally beautiful. They could save so much money if they stop using makeup products. If this is done then all the makeup manufacturing companies can be shut down. In this way all the pollution resulting from the makeup manufacturing companies would also be stopped.<br /><br />5. How To Reduce Transportation In The World<br /><br />If one country invents a thing and then exports it to other countries in the world, much transportation is needed. Instead of that the invented thing should be taught to every countries in the world. If done like this transportation would<br />be less needed. Only raw materials should be imported and exported<br />from one country to another. Countries should not import and export eatable things if it can be produced in their own countries. If one country has excess agricultural food grains, fruits, then only that country should export that things to other countries. If this is done, so much pollution can be reduced because of less transportation.<br />If one country has invented a thing and they would think that if they taught other countries the method to invent that thing, then they would lose profits, but that will not be the case as other countries when they will invent a thing, they will also teach the method to invent that thing to all other countries in the world.<br />If pollution problem was not present then no problem, one country after inventing a thing could transport it to all other countries in the world, but now as pollution problem is present, then this should not be done.<br /><br />6. Electricity Pollution<br /><br />We create electricity from many types of sources like coal, water, etc., but it creates pollution. If electricity created from windmill and solar energy then no pollution occurs. But still to manufacture windmill and solar machines pollution would occur.<br />As I previously said that if we shut down many manufacturing companies which are producing things which are not a necessity for humans, then the world would not require so much electricity. Then maybe we could provide electricity to the whole world from windmill and Solar panels which are not pollutant. If we stopped producing electricity from coal, water, etc., then the pollution resulting from them won&#39;t occur. Shouldn&#39;t we take this step to protect our earth as already our earth is suffering so much from global warming and climate change. Is their any other choice, I don&#39;t think so. <br />At present the world is researching how to solve the pollution problem, it would take how many years I don&#39;t know and also would it possible or impossible, God knows. Could we wait till that time when scientists would find how to solve pollution problems and till that the earth won&#39;t have a major natural disaster, nobody knows. We must shut down many companies which are not required as a necessity for humans.<br /><br />7. Free Things To The Peoples<br /><br />As I previously said to shut down many companies which are not required as a necessity for humans, if done then many would become jobless. So to solve this problem the world has to make food, clothing, shelter, medicine, surgeries and education free to the peoples. If this step is taken then we can shut down any company we want. The government&#39;s of every country should arrange agricultural lands in new places for farming and supply water and seeds and all other things necessary for farming free to the people&#39;s who have lost their source of income, if they do not have enough money to start farming on their own. If this is done then no one would starve for food and robberies can be reduced so much in the world.<br /><br />8. Firecrackers should be banned<br /><br />Firecrackers should be banned because it is harmful for animals. Animals have different levels of hearing and when we burst crackers which have a loud noise the dogs run away from that place. The dogs may hear the noise more louder than humans. When we fire the rocket cracker up in the sky and it bursts and if any bird is near to the explosion then that birds internal organs are damaged and they die just because of that explosion sound. Also peoples who have asthma illness, they face problems during Diwali. So much papers and threads are used in manufacturing crackers. The persons working in the manufacturing companies also suffer.<br />Now when their are animals rights for not harming them, then this step of banning firecrackers must be taken.<br /><br />9. Hair cutting salons are not required<br /><br />Instead of cutting our hair and shaving our beard in a salon, if everybody learns how to cut hair, then in a family everybody can cut each other&#39;s hair. If this is done then no need of hair cutting salons. All those hair cutting places can be used for other purposes.<br />We require scissors, blades, razors, shaving brush and shaving creams for hair cut and beard shaving. What if we use a hair removing soap for our hair cut and shaving purposes. Their is a soap for hair removal and it is also cheap. For women&#39;s who need hair cut for them scissors has to be used to cut the hair, no choice for that, but for men&#39;s hair cut and beard shaving if hair removing soap is used, he would become bald, but if we do this then we won&#39;t need to manufacture blades, razors, shaving brush and creams. All those manufacturing companies can be shut down and hence less pollution for the world.<br />People use hair dye to colour their hairs. The hair dye manufacturing companies after production dumps its waste in rivers or seas which pollutes the water. So all hair dye manufacturing companies should be shut down. For the sake of our planet earth this step must be taken.<br /><br />10. We Can Stop Eating Sweets, Cakes<br /><br />We consume sweets and cakes. We make it from many things such as wheat, coconut, etc. and add sugar to it. But what we want is the sweet thing to consume which we are getting directly from fruits. The fruit is naturally sweet. So if we want to consume sweets and cakes, we do not have to prepare it, just we have to eat fruits. So all the sweet manufacturing companies can be shut down. If you shut down a sweet manufacturing company, then so many paper boxes need not be manufactured which are used to pack the sweets.

Us not dying is a good benefit, I'd say. Crocs and dinos may like 110 degree summers, but humans won't last long. We'd have massive cattle dying (more than already dead from dried up states), chickens dying and wheat dying in 120 degree summers. What good would cheap energy be, if we can't grow food? I, for one, think solar farms are better tax spending than 700 Billion dollar spent on our military. We spend more on military than half the world's population combined (China, India, Russia, Saudi, UK, France and Japan). Cut the military spending to half for 1 year, which would be still greater than China, Russia and Saudi combined, we'll have 350 Billion to build solar farms. Government doesn't have to build it on their own. Subsidy tax payers for 20%, taxpayers themselves would pay for 80%. We don't have to pay for electricity for 15 years out of 30 year longevity of solar panels after they are paid off. That's cheap energy. But of course, Koch brothers vowed to spend 10 million to convince that climate change isn't happening. Their 50 Billion dollar business is at risk, if we decided to have less CO2. Who pays for the farm subsidies for dead cattle? We do, while coal guys make 50 billion dollars.

(Australian bushfires got nothing to do with climate change, most of them were caused by arsonists, also made worse by poor land management policy)	UCEcEuEiFp1bSESpabFS0LEw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEcEuEiFp1bSESpabFS0LEw	0

In my experience, talking with &quot;deniers&quot; well, it&#39;s very challenging. They won&#39;t even pause long enough to listen to anything. Not even to the most basic science regarding CO2 and how it functions in the atmosphere. For every fact, they have a counter argument, rebuttal, and if not they just say something like &quot;whatever, like scientists can even know that&quot;. For example, they say &quot;there is no consensus&quot; which proves that the science is debatable. But when you inform them of the consensus aka 97.7% they say &quot;see I knew it was a conspiracy&quot;. It&#39;s a spiraling discussion that goes nowhere.

Sensitivity is a net positive, meaning that the warming would be more than 0.7C. *"which not only isn't "catastrophic", it's beneficial."* "Catastrophic AGW" is a strawman you denialists made up. And you're willfully ignoring the negative effects CO2-driven anthropogenic climate change (ACC) has, such as ocean acidification, increased hurricane intensity, etc. *"Since CO2 forcing is logarithmic (each incremental increase has less and less of an effect),"* Another denialist PRATT. Atmospheric CO2 is currently increasing at a roughly exponential rate. Combined with the logarithmic effect you mentioned (along with other effects, such as decreasing CO2 uptake by sinks such as the ocean), this means the temperature increase roughly linear overtime (in a ~30 year time-scale), as opposed to the decreasing over-time. *"e'll enjoy another 0.4C of beneficial CO2 warming recovery by 2100, LESS the coming COOLING from collapsing solar cycles...."* Nope. CO2 has been more than offsetting effects from the solar cycle, and will continue to do so for decades and centuries to come.

CO2's forcing effect is only 0.7C per doubling by 2100, which not only isn't "catastrophic", it's beneficial. We've ENJOYED about 0.81C of beneficial warming recovery since the end of the Little Ice Age in 1850, of which, CO2 contributed just 0.3C of the total. Since CO2 forcing is logarithmic (each incremental increase has less and less of an effect), we'll enjoy another 0.4C of beneficial CO2 warming recovery by 2100, LESS the coming COOLING from collapsing solar cycles.... Because of the Grand Solar Minimum event we'll face from 2032, which will last 50~100 years, global temps will actually be COLDER than they are now by 2100..... The tiny amount of CO2 forcing between now and 2100 will help offset some of the terrible cooling that's coming... Oh, the irony....

Most, if not all, who proclaim to know are politically motivated more than they are motivated by the data. I have worked with two highly accredited climatologists. Neither one had any confidence in any of the data or models due to the limitations of measurement (mostly inconsistent methodology). Labeling them climate deniers just puts all of your cards on the table and makes you look foolish or like some sort of media person who really is just trying to keep the fund machine going.

Swedish education is very progressive whereas in the US it is compromised by pressure groups trying to mould education to their world view. The Swedes (and Scandinavians in general), by and large, are quite collectivist in their outlook. They generally subscribe to the idea that everyone is better off when we work for collective gains. This is why Scandinavians are far more relaxed about paying high taxes than others: They are confident that well-invested taxes provide exponential results. Americans are far more individualistic. They don't take kindly to being told what to do or how to think, and the White House hates the idea of being subjugated to international bodies such as the UN, the ICC or the IPCC. Since America is so corrupt, they have no faith in their governments disbursing tax receipts constructively. Big industry, in particular big pharma, the fossil fuel industry and the military industrial cartel, are the big winners from US tax spending. You could also add that the very religious Americans are kinda gullible and prone to latching onto any viewpoints that accord with their own world view, whereas the more pragmatic Swedes place their faith in scientists.

That land area around have lot of dead animals and other biologic materials stored in permafrost that didn't melt for 500 000years. Now is started to melt. Problem is when this start to decompose it will release very potent green effect methane gas. It have 32 times higher effect than CO2. We have there temp. dependent ticking bomb. Problem is that temp. there is rising much faster then on other places on Earth and you know difference between ice and no ice is small. You have on 30°F ice and on 34°F melted thing. This is why we should limit global temp. to 1,5- 2°C (3,6°F) and that's why this 12years. Because if we continue this pace in 12years we will have point with no return. When this thing start to emit that amount of methane earth will start to heat more, than it melts even more and you get even more gas. The reason why this area from north pole is heating so fast is less and less white snow in summer that reflect sun radiation back in space. So less snow more heating and also more methane gas and more water expansion from heated oceans. If we pass that 2°C, it is unstoppable ! Temp of earth will rise more than 5°C than, you have than Antarctic melting. All ice there is on land so sea level rise rate will be higher, then you have permafrost from there.. Then you have further expansion of ocean because heated water expand and then we can talk about significant sea level rise .. That's why AOC said we will have climate disaster in 12years what is not true. I will be START of climate disaster. She was scared when she did read IPCC sr15 report.

If your cause is absent, yet your effect is present, then your causal argument is weak. <br /><br />2. Even if we accept your premises as accurate, a question of quantity is still unanswered: how do you we know that the amount of increase in global temperature caused by CO2 equals the amount of CO2 produced by humans? This quantity is especially important because your own data proves that the current CO2 level existed when humans did not exist; therefore, the same natural conditions as before could produce the same effects today.<br /><br />3. You constantly cherry pick the evidence: your timeline starts at 1770, then 1870, and then 1970. You must show the data from all years to be accurate because there could be drops in global temperature when CO2 levels were high. This video is an insult to basic statistics.

Global temps are kept in a narrow range due to cloud cover feedbacks and long-term Milankovitch cycles... When earth's orbit around the sun is elliptical and the earth is tilted away from the sun, global temps fall, when earth's orbit is circular and is tilted towards the sun, global temps are warm... CO2 has almost NOTHING to do with global warming.... perhaps 0.7C per CO2 doubling, which is a net benefit... The stupid CAGW hypothesis projected 5C of CO2 induced warming by 2100, when it will actually be only 0.7C, which explains the HUGE disparity between CAGW's hilarious projections vs. reality: https://drinkingwateradvisor.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/pages-from-christyjr_epa_2014_publiccomment.jpg	UC-ghQ8wXfPm6eOw5yMxOZLg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-ghQ8wXfPm6eOw5yMxOZLg	1	Ugit6W2zhn_FPngCoAEC	Steph Liveright

If the tree has experienced stressful conditions, such as a drought, the tree might hardly grow at all in those years.&quot;<br /><br />What happens if it&#39;s warm and dry? This would cause the ring to be thinner. What happens if it&#39;s cold and there is a drought? I would imagine that this would also cause the wring to be thinner. My thoughts is that they would probably do a correlation between ice cores too, but just wondering...<br /><br />My quote came from NASA:<br /><a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2540/tree-rings-provide-snapshots-of-earths-past-climate/">https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2540/tree-rings-provide-snapshots-of-earths-past-climate/</a>	UCsPvWZDpsFBECYkgOKMAl3Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsPvWZDpsFBECYkgOKMAl3Q	0

(it will usually warm briefly in January and then another wave of winter worse than the first half commences). This is almost every year I can remember. Some years we have northern style snows, where it will freeze or snow remains for several days, almost a two weeks, or/and then remain cold and dry. Oklahoma is known for &quot;random&quot; weather.. but the pattern is kinda similar each year, it just varies in timing of when it happens. But it&#39;s definitely... abruptly winter from mildly warm falls, remains winter with a few struggles for warmth if it&#39;s dry, but the systems nail us with the cold.

While leaves get bigger, they get unhealthier, too, and little by little the soil stops supporting plant life as CO2 goes up. In a greenhouse, where artificial fertilizers and irrigation are available, these effects can be countered, though it is costly to manage. In the wild? Plants get weedier, then the ground turns rotten. Meanwhile extreme wildfire weather, drought, aridity, polar vortex, heat dome, flood, invasive species spread due climate change amplified beyond the level of life to adapt.

He stated (at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjIyms1BX4&amp;t=3m44s">3:44</a>) that from 1900 until today that the average temperature in the world has increased 1 degree. And then concluded that within the next 100 years we will see a temperature increase from 2.4 to 4.8%, and a subsequent increase in sea level by 1 meter. Politically I’m “independent” so I don’t have a dog in the political fight - but rather I’m seeking the truth.<br /><br />Because I’m over 50 years old, I’ve been around long enough to see a lot of scientific “facts” turn out to be wrong. And while I love science, I also am enamored with the study of human behavior. That being said, I’ve seen waaaaay too many scientists start off with the conclusion, and then try and prove what they already believe to be true. I just found out that there’s actually a term for it, “confirmation bias”. (It’s when you form an opinion and then you create a theory. And then you work hard to prove it). Does anyone remember when “killer bees” were going to wipe out North America, and it was a sure thing? Or when it was determined as fact that the “walking catfish” in Florida bodies of water were going to wipe out the entire fish ecosystem throughout the U.S.? I’m not doubting some of these facts, especially the CO2 situation.......but can someone point me to a better source of information that does more than leap from the 1 degree historical temperature change, to the 2.5 - 5% that is “certainly” coming our way? (While I do have a skeptical eye, I am teachable and want to know the science of what we know and don’t know about the future climate change situation........and help is GREATLY appreciated!!).

Heat up 2 lb of copper of 5000 pounds of copper is nothing! My second point is sublimation. Co2 will not condense into a liquid. IT DOES ON VENUS BUT not ON EARTH OR MARS! <br />They point to Venus and say the co2 is responsible for its 900-degree heat. Venus has 90 times the pressure of Earth and will allow its co2 to be effective as a greenhouse gas!<br /><br /><br /> When Mars has roughly the same amount of c02 concentration and is ineffective in heating Mars. The difference is Sublimation ie Pressure allows the co2 in venus to condense into a liquid. Mars and Earth do not have enough pressure for co2 to condense. Dry ice goes from solid to gas skipping the liquid phase. It is why science and the physics on Earth does not consider Oxygen or nitrogen or Argon as a greenhouse gas. <br />The reason is you cannot blame water vapor that is the major greenhouse gas because water vapor does confidence. Water in the state of Ice will melt into a liquid then to a gas phase and it reverses the same. <br /><br /><br />Yessssssss! the earth is heating up! but co2 is not the reason. The earth has been heating up since the last Ice age.. and Yes faster right now... Reason? If you have a full glass of ice water and the ice will melt slowly.. but the last ice cube melts faster then the full glass. We are at the tail end of the melting... It is melting faster! <br />If you had a pot of stew ... the items in the stew do not add heat. Turn up the burner (the sun) and the stew will get hotter Not the Items in the stew.

Comparisons to Venus are ridiculous. Mars has a much higher concentration of CO2. It also has much less CO2 per unit volume. Also not a good comparison.

That is where our ideology fundamentally differs. To me, it is infinitely more important that I help others. If the only way into a good afterlife is by sitting idle while hundreds of thousands starve and praying to a god that allows such strife to exist, I will gladly defy that god and act of my own accord. I'm going to use every moment of my life to ensure my own happiness, the happiness of those around me, and the happiness of as many people who's lives I can touch. I reject the notion that I should accept a god that demands I put him first. I will do good things, and if there is a god and if that god is just, he won't condemn me to an absurd afterlife of fire and pain.

Further, we need to prepare for how to brace ourselves for the consequences of the damage that we aren't able to reverse with our current technology. There is no magical solution for the damage we've unwittingly caused for the past couple centuries. But we can try to mitigate further damage to try and sustain the environment our civilization is prepared for. With the current state of the world, with humanity divided into nation states and wealth and power in the hands of relatively few, we are not prepared to deal with drastic changes to our environment. If steps are not take to prevent those changes, the world will see levels of instability culturally and politically that could potentially rip apart our infant civilization.

We're objectively in the middle of the 6th mass extinction on this planet, right now, without even needing to bring Climate Change into the equation. Blaming humans isn't why that's true, and neither is the the CO2 level (tho those may be factors).

However I do have a bit of advice for you and PBS.<br /><br />If you want to change minds, avoid presenting tribal themes in the begging of your videos. ie, deniers, and skeptics of the most extreme kinds. It sets off a psychological tribal based challenge to anyone watching and as you other video wrongly pointed out, it will interrupt any possible conscious thinking going on due to the emotional response of the threat to tribal identity . <br /><br />Regardless of intention you should lead all videos with the simplest introduction, then the facts, reasoning, then conclusions.

And the data provided on this topic is just not scientific and precise enough to prove that climate change is caused by humans, or even a threat to our global health. That's why, I think, a lot of people are denying climate change. Because they mix up the terms.

During the Wolf GSM, 25% of Europe's population was wiped out from: exposure, frozen rivers (stopped transportation), short growing season, huge crop frost loss and famine... When the Black Death started in 1352 (just 2 years after the Wolf GSM ended), 50% of the remaining population was wiped out... The next solar cycle starting in 2021 will be as weak as the Dalton GSM, and the one after that from 2032 will be as weak as the Maunder GSM (1645~1715).... Brrrr.... The Mother of All Ironies is that the tiny amount of CO2 induced warming will help offset SOME of the coming cooling we're about to experience....

Therefore this video is all rubbish, apart from the old Revelle and Arrhienus thesis there is neither proof nor fact for CO2 being the main culprit. The models are continuously adjusted to follow the reality and predict nothing. Water, clouds and solar cycles are not considered in the models. The ice core data show that the CO2 lags the temperature. On the NASA website they cite the IPCC report as proof and IPCC cites NASA as proof. In the IPCC references there is also no other relevant proof for the CO2 thesis. The temperature data only comes from two US government agency sources (NASA and NOAA) so they report as required. The data are modified each year to &#39;adjust&#39; for biases. Unbiased data do not show anywhere near the warming and the manmade component is most likely minimal but exists. Supposedly 15 degrees is the optimal average temperature (which is nonsense in itself) and we are at 14.8. Worldwide FIVE BILLION dollars are paid to climate change researchers EACH YEAR by governments. Not any oil interests who anyway couldn&#39;t care less about this as it just raised the price of their product. The inventor of the statistical hokey stick joke Michael Mann gets paid millions from the EPA. Talk about scientists being paid off. Even the Arctic and Antarctic icepacks are today in the official sources within the statistical error for the average if the last 30 years. According to Al Gore the Arctic should be gone by now and all polar bears dead. We have a five fold increase in polar bears to 25000 in the last 20 years because they restricted the hunting. How much more stupid stuff can anyone believe. Finally, I am all for reducing emissions and cleaning up our air as we have done in Europe in the last 30 years where pollution in large cities dropped 70%. If anyone would REALLY believe that CO2 is the problem then the only real solution would be nuclear energy which could be up and running in a decade. Why not ? Because everyone knows it is not a real problem. Any other idea especially renewables are just nonsense. It is all about taxing the wealthy countries and distributing the money to others. The UN wants a $100 BILLION from the US alone EACH year. Now that is the only reason for the climate change scare! The UN and IPCC admits they won&#39;t change anything but they still want the money. They have to create panic, because in a few years people might notice despite the fake data that the catastrophe isn&#39;t coming.

Climate data is regularly collected independently by at least 5 agencies and 3 satellite services plus reanalyzed from original data source in peer-reviewed literature occasionally and they all agree. Even skeptical sources like BEST agree. And, of course, FIVE BILLION dollars are NOT paid to climate change researchers EACH YEAR by governments. Most climate research is performed by private institutions and it is done for free (as a requirement of teaching positions or completing doctoral degrees). At most governments toss in some grant money for hiring students or lab space. It is expressly forbidden for scientists to financially benefit from their research in a direct way, just to keep them unbiased. For the same reason, the IPCC is an all volunteer organization. At this point it should be clear to any reader that you have no knowledge about the climate topic so there's little point addressing all the the other falsehoods in your comment.

What else is there to know, he asks 😂. In your case, everything. First of all, it is "Their", not "there" (the educated start sentences with capital letters). And secondly, you clearly don’t understand Skepticalscience’s critique of Postma’s paper – if you bothered to read it at all. If you knew what you were talking about, you would understand that the model that averages total solar flux – the layer model - is not Skepticalscience’s work. It is a model that is used for educational purposes, and as SS point out, it is used in, among other publications, Dennis Hartmann’s Global Physical Climatology, David Archer’s Understanding the Forecast, Marshall and Plumb’s Atmosphere, Ocean and Climate Dynamics, and radiation books like Grant Petty’s First Course in Atmospheric Radiation. So you cannot attribute the model to SS. And even if you could, you still couldn't infer that it posits a flat Earth. While you might criticize the model for not representing the physics of the greenhouse effect very precisely – it is after all a diagram designed for undergrad study – you have to be a special kind of stupid to make the assumption that it is based on a flat Earth simply because there is no curvature in the diagram. Where Postma – and you – find yourselves getting so confused is with your inability to recognize the geometrical re-distribution factor in the equation 1370/4=342.5 W/m2 . But you are not a climate scientist, and neither is Joseph Postma. You’re both out of your depth, you’re both hopelessly unrealistic about what you know about the planet, and you will continue to make fools of yourselves until you learn a bit of humility. “You think that facts are based on some kind of journal supporting someone’s work?

That is the very definition of irrelevant. What relevance is a point nobody brings up? “Which is why no one has ever come up with such a concept?” Joe pastma brang it up and I’m sure others did as well.” If you want to cling on to what remaining credibility you have left, you at least need to bother to spell names correctly, especially when they have already been spelt correctly for you. It’s Postma (capital P) and the past tense of “bring” is “brought”. When you can’t even get simple stuff like this right, why should anyone believe you can get the complexities of the GHE right? And if you’re sure others – apart from Postma – brought it up as well, why don’t you provide a citation? That’s how research and debate is conducted. Postma’s screed is a joke. And this isn’t my opinion, or that of the scientists who compile Skepticalscience. It is the opinions of well-known climate change sceptics such as Dr Roy Spencer https://www.drroyspencer.com/2019/06/on-the-flat-earth-rants-of-joe-postma/ “skeptical science? Ha! That’s one of the most BS websites on the web!” It comes as no surprise that a website that substantiates its articles by providing citations to peer reviewed research is one you would characterize as BS. If you want to ignore Skepticalscience because they don’t tell you what you want to hear, or because they expose your hero Joe Postma for the confused belligerent he really is, like all sound science publications, they post links to the research that underpins their articles. “They make just about everything up and cherry pick everything they say on there!” Well go on then: Provide us with examples of them making stuff up, or cherry-picking. “…on nights that aren’t as cold the sky is covered with clouds which create thermal mass and humidity that keeps temperatures from cooling too much.

"That would conclude that you can spread solar energy over the entire surface of the earth at once which simply isn’t the case. Once you have a false found foundation...." Speaking of false foundations, your comical explanation thus far is based upon a very false foundation. "Also greenhouse effect doesn’t work like a real greenhouse does." At least you got this right. Greenhouses work by blocking convective heat loss, whereas the atmospheric GHE slows radiative heat loss. "The physics is based on the premise that once again you can spread sunlight over the entire surface of the earth which is simply false." The physics of the greenhouse effect is based upon no such thing. You need to be a lot more selective in the sources you read. Where did you read this crap? "You have day and night and you have means of convective transport in the mix which create the cumulonimbus clouds and such." Oh, onto clouds now... you're very very confused. "So basically to sum it up we have solar flux coming in assuming it’s the temperature radiated off a black body which then bounces back off the earths surface which is flat in There models which is then trapped by the supposed greenhouse gases which take the solar energy and convert it to heat from a much cooler body to warm a much warmer one. Kind of like trying to warm a turkey with a hair dryer in the arctic circle the physics simply don’t match up." This is just complete garbage. It bears no relation to any discursive overview of the GHE I have ever read. God knows what you've been reading. It isn't difficult to find coherent explanations. https://www.environment.gov.au/climate-change/climate-science-data/climate-science/greenhouse-effect Or try this https://climatekids.nasa.gov/greenhouse-effect "Hence I suggest we look at science a little differently before making such faulty assumptions.

You've just trotted out a long and very tedious stream of incoherent nonsense that goes against the wealth of collective understanding of how our atmosphere keeps the planet at an inhabitable temperature - and you've somehow convinced it is others who have been brainwashed with false science.

The so called greenhouse effect theory is based on the premise that you have incoming solar energy hitting the earth that energy gets bounced back off the earths surface and then gets trapped by greenhouse gases as twice the amount of thermal and Kenetic energy is readmitted downward to warm the earths surface. But there’s just one problem with that. If you look at the mathmatical models seen in that presentation he goes on to state they assume you start out with a flat surface. That would conclude that you can spread solar energy over the entire surface of the earth at once which simply isn’t the case. Once you have a false found foundation you can then build upon that foundation by saying that because the energy flux is admitted over the entire surface of the earth we can then magically take that energy bounce it off the earths surface and back to space but then because of the magic greenhouse gases we can take that heat from a cooler body of air which defines the laws of thermodynamics which states you can’t take heat and transport it form a cooler body to warm a warmer one simply doesn’t work like that so they convert sunlight over a black body to -18C which is very cold. Also greenhouse effect doesn’t work like a real greenhouse does. The physics is based on the premise that once again you can spread sunlight over the entire surface of the earth which is simply false. You have day and night and you have means of convective transport in the mix which create the cumulonimbus clouds and such. So basically to sum it up we have solar flux coming in assuming it’s the temperature radiated off a black body which then bounces back off the earths surface which is flat in There models which is then trapped by the supposed greenhouse gases which take the solar energy and convert it to heat from a much cooler body to warm a much warmer one. Kind of like trying to warm a turkey with a hair dryer in the arctic circle the physics simply don’t match up.

There are 5 main points: 1.) they are viscous, we are stuck within the object as a whole. 2.) they are non-local, an over there-ness, makes it hard to see. 3.) there is phasing involved, it&#39;s appearance is always perceived as over there. 4.) inter-objectivity, the hardest concept an other worldly out there in-the-future never here phenomena. 5.) temporal undulation, also a type of around-the-next-corner other&#39;s problem, instead of mine problem. These terms make clear why it&#39;s so hard to do or get anything done. It&#39;s here in front of all of us but we can&#39;t see it because we&#39;re stuck in, around, through, and by it-in-the-future hyperobject. That&#39;s why it&#39;s so hard to get anything done, it goes against all forms of near term alarm by being everywhere but here. Lastly, the norm now is growth it&#39;s natural, survival is negative growth and sustainability and it&#39;s probably too late to change. If we all don&#39;t change we will soon join the 97% species the have gone extinct.	UCe9q5T3gBUV6xOl0HlBIFjA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe9q5T3gBUV6xOl0HlBIFjA	0

Short cycles last for 1 decade longer cycles 3 decades. The less energy...current phase...the warmer the oceans stay. During peak energy cycles there is more thermal lift so oceans actually cool. This balance varies and necessary for biological migration. The atmosphere gases have no impact on temperature since water is the vechicle for thermal distribution.

Yet temperatures haven&#39;t budged one bit from the last twelve thousand year Holocene interglacial average. Temperatures have been naturally increasing since the Little Ice Age in the 1600s. The thermometer was invented in an uptrend one hundred years later. A natural uptrend that has only reached halfway up the natural historical pattern of the Holocene. The thermometer hasn&#39;t been around long enough to understand how much today&#39;s climate is completely normal. In our current Holocene interglacial, temperatures have risen and fallen at least four degrees C (~8 degrees F) at least a dozen times. Today we&#39;re right in the middle of that twelve thousand year range. The late twentieth century coincidental rise of CO2 with temperature is just that - coincidental. Temperatures rose just as much and just as fast during the early twentieth century before any significant CO2 rise. The temperature change is completely normal. The CO2 increase is not. (normal CO2 during our Holocene interglacial has been 180-280ppm) probably from a combination of fossil fuel use and aggressive land clearing. But since CO2 is NOT THE CONTROL KNOB OF CLIMATE, has an increase in CO2 been harmful or beneficial? The answer is COMPLETELY BENEFICIAL. A little more CO2, in the context of the 600 million year natural decline of CO2 from 7000ppm to today&#39;s natural near lethally low levels, a little more CO2 has been a Godsend.

An increase in ocean temps will slightly increase ocean evaporation, which leads to increased cloud cover, which acts as a negative feedback to global warming. Conversely, falling ocean temps decrease ocean evaporation, which decreases cloud formation leading to more solar radiation hitting the earth and warming it back up... Increasing Solar TSI/ sunspot activity increases global warming as we saw in the 20th century. The strongest 63-yr string of solar cycles in 11,400 years occurred from 1933~1996. When these string solar cycles ended, so did the global warming trend... The next solar cycle starting around 2022 will be the weakest since 1790, and the one starting 2035 is expected to be the weakest since the Munder Mimumum in 1645~1715. There is an excellent chance of another Grand Solar Minimum starting from2035 and lasting 50~100 years. If one occurs, global temps will be colder by 2100 than they are now.... Oh, the irony...

Arctic sea ice has NO effect on sea level rise, and its ice extents follow 30-year AMO and PDO warm/cool cycles. From around 2020, both the PDO and AMO will be in their respective 30-year cool cycles and Arctic sea ice extents will recover as they always do.... Greenland land ice will also increase when the AMO and PDO are both in their 30-year cool cycles... CO2 has nothing to do with it.

It was the scent that rain carries with it. I love it a lot. Suddenly the grey clouds arrived and it started raining cats and dogs. I left but thunder and lightning followed and it rained like that for almost 3 months. That was my last good memory of a proper rain pattern. It would always come on time, either the first week of April or the last week of May. Last year, I saw very little rain. It would rain for 3 days a week and then it would be dry again. I miss the scent of rain clouds. It almost never rains during the day time anymore here. Only during night. This is a literal example of climate change and people still don&#39;t believe in it.

UghqmsWl4Z3RpHgCoAEC	0	0	2017-06-28 13:02:17	Oliver Thöle	So, there was this period between 3-5 million years BC where the average world temperature was constantly, except for a few exceptions, between zero and two degrees Celsius, whereas 2016, the average temperature was only 0.99°C (which was described as &quot;hottest year in recorded history). About 300 years ago, the last &quot;Ice Age&quot; ended and since then, the temperature started going up. The Climatic Optimum (250 BC-400 AC) was a warm period (around 2°C) warmer than today&#39;s climate. The Thermal Maximum (about 55 Mio. years ago) was so hot (between 14 and 16 degrees Celsius), palm trees could grow on the poles. Climate is far too complex and has too many factors to be ascribed to just carbon oxide emissions (which still is a factor of climate). Nonetheless, if we keep burning fossil fuels, someday, there are none left and that is, in my humble opinion, the reason we should work on an alternative.

And stating, "well it is" doesn't prove your point either. I could just say, "Well it isn't," and that has just as much validity as your statement. But with a hypothetical, I'll show you why it's not the worst thing that could happen to humans. If a war were to break out that is so massive most governments stop functioning properly and crime is the norm, from torture to murder and so forth. And this lasts for generations. Would you prefer that reality or extinction? Choosing extinction means you agree extinction is not the worst possible scenario for humans. And to actually detail my point originally, it's not to diminish Climate Change's importance and our job to stop it, but that it could take quite awhile for it to actually become a critical extinction danger for humans, though of course other animals like polar bears are already affected much more and will be extinct far sooner than us, and that is definitely something worth stopping but doesn't make it such a critical danger (yet) for humans. Though also, the most significant impact any individual can have on climate change, is to have a plant-based / Vegan diet. The last time I checked (about a year or two ago) Animal Agriculture is the LEADING cause of green-house gas emissions, even more than all the world's transportation combined. Veganism is when you care for the animals and that's why you don't eat animal products, but even if you don't care about them, being plant-based (which is the same as Veganism but without you caring for animals) is beneficial to you and the world because it is the best thing any individual can do if you really want to stop or slow down climate change. And plant-based diets have been proven healthy for all stages of life, from pregnancy to adulthood.

In fact many of the issues I'd say are more important, also deal with climate change ANYWAYS. Like the purposeful burning of the rainforests that it doesn't seem anyone is doing anything to help. That's definitely terrible for climate. And if you didn't know, the BIGGEST cause of green-house gas emissions is the Animal Agriculture industry, which causes more emissions than ALL of the transportation industries of the world combined. So the SINGLE biggest thing you can do to help stop climate change is go Vegan. Are you already Vegan? If not, it is the single best thing you can do for the environment, and yes you can be PERFECTLY healthy on a Vegan diet through all stages of life, including pregnancy to adult-hood. So if you're not willing to stop eating animal products because "they taste good" you don't really care about climate change.

Climate is not weather, it is not today&#39;s weather, not an average of this week, this month, this year, not even this decade. A century mark is getting somewhat closer. Climate is based on the average temperature and climate for thousands of years. Using the period of time these guys do is akin to going fishing and just because you did not catch a single fish that day you claim the lake is completely empty of fish! The Earth has been through &quot;climate change&quot; long before we were here (and worse). As far as I can tell, the planet is still here. There are still animals and plants. They may not be what was here 65 million years ago or even 12, 000 years ago but since WE weren&#39;t here maybe... MAYBE... climate change occurs naturally. Humans are SO arrogant as to think we know what&#39;s best for this planet when we have only been here a few thousand years. Perhaps what is best for the planet is not the same as what we want, that being the best for us.	UCfYi0ttWDzJhKEzSptT-xaQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfYi0ttWDzJhKEzSptT-xaQ	0

Saying &quot;what else could it be&quot; is not an argument for it being CO2, just as not knowing how thunder works is not an argument for thor causing it by riding his chariot across the sky.<br /><br />Also, you are happy to talk about ice cores when it comes to CO2, but using ice cores to see temperature from the last 6000 years shows that the temperature has generally been a bit higher than it is now, and that we are coming up from a cooling period ending around 150-200 years ago, which also is when the water started rising, which it has done lineary, not rising faster as CO2 has risen.<br /><br />Also, you ignore that we had just as much heating from 1900 to 1945, as we had from 1975 onwards, despite the fact that we did not start using CO2 in high levels until after ww2.<br /><br />Also you just assume that its a problem that it gets hotter, depiste that humans has, according to the ice cores, and atleast in europe, thrived in just as warm, or warmer temperatures.<br /><br />These are the problems i have with the theory, i came to this video hoping you&#39;d handle them, but instead you say &quot;we are right, and if you disagree you are stupid, CO2 is causing the heating because i say so, its bad because i say so, its overall better to cut fossile fuels because i say so, and i dont have to prove any of it&quot;, and that only really convinces people who havn&#39;t really though about it.

Following the link, you get to each ..ahem, &quot;fact&quot; which gives you another link to another presentation of &quot;facts&quot; like this video. You could perpetually cite each other as sources. The claims about the rate of sea level rise, land and sea ice extent aren&#39;t true according to CSIRO, MASIE, the National Snow and Ice Data centre respectively. What piqued my interest is the claim regarding solar energy dropping (a minimum happens in cycles that should lower average temperature similar to 1941-1979) but a rise is still observed. This, as far as I&#39;m aware, is the environmentalist link suggesting the &quot;human caused,&quot; &quot;unnatural&quot; warming that is down to CO2. I&#39;ve seen a few videos that briefly mention this near the end, but don&#39;t expand on it or link to any studies regarding the data for the solar activity. Again, looking at NASA/SDO data, the drop in solar activity hasn&#39;t happened yet, so are these 11 year cycle graphs simply further projections of future climate?

I for one would prefer to live in a warm climate rather than have to bore a 1 mile deep hole to go ice fishing. I would rather Florida get a bit soggier than the agriculture plains freeze over.

This video doesn&#39;t really cover much on explaining how it is CO2&#39;s fault. It kinda goes over it but mostly it just assumes it&#39;s bc of CO2. But the problem I have is when people argue against it they say that we assume that the co2 is the significant reason for climate change. <br /><br />In short people that argue against climate change will ignore this video bc from the start it assumes an assumption that they already don&#39;t agree with (CO2 being a significant factor)	UCqIxWQ33m-H8GKLVv8lZX2A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqIxWQ33m-H8GKLVv8lZX2A	0

It kinda goes over it but mostly it just assumes it's bc of CO2. But the problem I have is when people argue against it they say that we assume that the co2 is the significant reason for climate change."* It's a well-evidenced fact that humans (largely via anthropogenic greenhouse gases) caused most of the global warming that occurred since the mid-20th century. Arguing about this point, is like arguing over whether HIV causes AIDS or whether smoking causes cancer. There are at least *50* scientific papers showing this. These papers use various techniques, including: - model-based prediction, where those models were tested against previous data, including paleoclimatological data, akin to how one can predict the generate astronomical models that explain the motion of planets/satellites and then use those models to predict the motion of other planets/satellites; the models predict how much warming would result from solar forcing, CO2 release, etc. based on how much warming resulted from these factors in the past - examining warming patterns in different layers of the atmosphere (since different forcings produce different patterns of atmospheric warming, with greenhouse gases having a particular atmospheric warming pattern). So different methods have yielded much the same conclusion. That is a hallmark of good science: *consilience* of different results on the same, accurate conclusion. That way, the strengths of one methods can compensate for the weaknesses in another method, and you know that your result is not just due to the flaws of one particular methods. Here are some of the 50+ scientific papers on this: "Causes of the Global Warming Observed since the 19th Century" "Attribution of observed historical near-surface temperature variations to anthropogenic and natural causes using CMIP5 simulations" "Anthropogenic and natural warming inferred from changes in Earth’s energy balance" "Attributing Observed SST Trends and Subcontinental Land Warming to Anthropogenic Forcing during 1979–2005" "Sensitivity of the attribution of near surface temperature warming to the choice of observational dataset" "A probabilistic quantification of the anthropogenic component of twentieth century global warming" "Identifying human influences on atmospheric temperature" "Quantifying anthropogenic influence on recent near-surface temperature change" "Evidence for external forcing on 20th-century climate from combined ocean-atmosphere warming patterns"	UCWZGVxHPDNenYs5mkxjUwhA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWZGVxHPDNenYs5mkxjUwhA	1	UggMR_z9F8z6QngCoAEC	ucsdsnsd4

Did you know that conservatives favor “conserving” by nature? Most desire energy independence, and would like alternative energy options that rival the cost efficiency of oil. Most would be willing to invest in new technologies to help us get there. What they don’t like is being dismissed as ignorant or being judged for not believing as others do.

To Make The World A Better Place<br /><br />Humans build homes to stay, while animals just live in caves, live in the open field or just dig mud and stay. We humans for making homes cut down trees of the forest and then build homes. By this trees are getting reduced. Nowadays many people do not have to eat. If humans too stopped building homes and live in the open forest, trees would grow everywhere and so many fruits would be in the trees. If this is done no living being humans or animals would starve, because at present when we cut trees, so many birds and many animals which eat the trees fruits and leaves have to find some another tree. We would have to build schools, colleges, hospitals because without that we can&#39;t help ourselves. For clothes just we should hand stitch and just use white colour, because if we colour the clothes, pollution occurs. No plastic buttons should be used, only rubber buttons should be used. If there are no homes people could go anywhere, no need for two neighbouring countries to fight for land dispute at countries boundaries. At present what we are doing it is polluting the world and one day a major earthquake, tsunami, super volcano would come and many lives would be lost. So if we too lived in the open forest there will be no pollution, also our foods would be without chemicals. The very important thing no living being would starve.<br /><br />19. We build homes to stay which is wrong<br /><br />Previously the whole world was forest. When a home is built, that much forest is destroyed, at that place there was a tree or some grass which the animals would eat. Human population is increasing year by year. New homes have to be built always. One day the whole forest, agricultural land would be homes. How would we produce food grains. Well it would take many years, maybe 50000 years or more from now on, I don&#39;t know , but then do we have to continue what is not right. We should live in the open forest as animals live and we have to survive. We have to find how to survive without harming the environment. Is there any choice, there is no other choice, we have to stop building homes. If we keep on building homes, then one day the whole lands of the world would be homes. When we build homes, we need so many things like mud, sea mud, cement, iron. They have to be transported from one place to another. For transportation we need vehicles and then for vehicles to operate we need petrol, diesel, oil. To get petrol we have to make oil rig platforms in the sea or land. For digging petrol so many machines have to be made. We need iron to make machines. We have to set up factories to make machines. But if we don&#39;t build homes to stay and live in the open forest as animals live, then we do not need the above said things. The above said things which when created and used creates pollution. If we don&#39;t use them, pollution also won&#39;t occur. Previously in the past when humans did live in open forest or caves, at that time all the animals, birds did have plenty to eat the fruits and leaves of the trees. Even humans before knowing fire, certainly they used to eat raw foods and somehow lived their life. When humans started building homes, after that forests became homes, trees were cut down and then the animals have to find some another tree for their food. The same is going to happen to humans if we keep on building homes. Simply we have to understand that this is not practicable. <br /><br />If all of the earth&#39;s land would be forest, no roads, everything muddy, not even mud roads, then for transportation we need horses, bullocks, elephants. If a person has to be taken to a hospital immediately then horses, etc. may not be able to reach us immediately. At that time we have to use small airplanes or helicopters that would reach us immediately.<br /><br />If we live in the open forest rainy season and winter season would be a problem for us. We may find shelter under the trees so that we won&#39;t get wet but if we still get wet then we may have to use raincoats which is not made from plastic as plastic is a pollutant. In summer season we could find shelter from the sun by sitting under a tree. But if we are travelling what should we do. Living in the open forest seems very hard but we have to find out to live somehow. Research should be made on this on a large scale. At present we are researching life on other planets and finding how to settle on moon and mars and even if that is possible we will one day pollute moon and mars and then we would have to go to some other planets. So much money is being spent on that. That research should be stopped till the earth is ok and that money should be used for researching on how to live in the open forest.<br /><br />20. If We Have To Live In The Open Forest<br /><br />At present if we have to live in the open forest, it is impossible. We would have to face many problems. If we demolished all our building&#39;s and homes, then all the rubble has to be cleared and what should be done with the rubble, all the rubble should be grinded till it is thin like sand and maybe if we buried the rubble in the ground, then at that place could we grow trees and plants, it may or may not be possible. This should be researched.<br />I think previously before humans were evolved, how nature was and when humans started evolving they were also going by natural means. We maybe have to do that only to save our earth. Previously humans did not know to speak and also what knowledge the world possesses now was not their before. If we started living in the open forest and face countless number of problems, we may also find a solution to the problems soon maybe, it may not take long.

If 400ppm is 1 degree C, the next degree takes an additional 800ppm, the next 1600ppm. Sea levels are not rising in fact in many places they are decreasing. World-leading sea-level expert Prof. emeritus Nils Axel Mörner presents some stark examples that show how the IPCC and climate activists are wildly exaggerating their claims of rapid sea level rise. Mörner studied the Kattegat Sea between Denmark and Sweden. In this region, sea level has not increased as announced by climate alarmists but instead decreased. Stockholm’s tide record is the second longest in Europe; the mean long-term change in sea level is a decline of 3.8 mm per year. In addition, Every temperature chart published shows CO2 lagging temperature change not driving it. Every model produced by these &quot;scientists&quot; is completely wrong and had they not faked the historical data making it colder, the change in temperatures would be even less than we have. The only model anywhere near a real reduction is the Russian atmospheric model. Every model produced by others has been proven drastically wrong. Please, No more anecdotal evidence, you are going to have to show me the hard data, not the proverbial &quot;hot air&quot; explanations. BTW, water vapor is the 90% driver of atmospheric temperature change as every cloud has a latent heat exchange warming the atmosphere. The latest NASA photos show a greening earth which will benefit mankind.	UCzh2UsBAdG27V13OYZ4xLeA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzh2UsBAdG27V13OYZ4xLeA	0

The University of Colorado, which manages the Jason satellites on contract to NASA, reported that not only had there been no acceleration of sea level rise in the satellite data there had been a deceleration in the last decade (2008-2018); so even the satellite data had not been able to detect acceleration of sea level! (Source: Thank God for Tide Gauges, Howard T Brady, Spectator Magazine) (2) The Maldives was predicted to sink underwater completely by 2018. But this DID NOT happen. Sea level expert Morner discovered not only sea level has NOT risen for the Maldives, it has fallen. (Source: Wattsupwiththat dot com) (3) Tuvalu, instead of sinking, is GROWING in size.

The video above rests entirely on hapless historic temp data graphs demonstrating the charade. Your citation demonstrating the polar opposite (see what I did there? lol) is just another example of the cretinous mentality that envelops you loons. Hardly my fault you lack the mental capacity to research your own citations. The unassailable fact is temp dropped as co2 rose, you have no case	UCGyI5Vb4RPWfeWdBtlPgRbw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGyI5Vb4RPWfeWdBtlPgRbw	1	UgxRXCIfAc5q0_gfGWB4AaABAg	Bertie Blue

Of course nobody ever said that his would lead to a temperature increase everywhere... There is always local variation... Btw did you even realize that the two argument of the blog you linked to and the blog about arrtic temperature contradict one another? He arfues that the increase in temperature is the reason for the increase in co2 forcing..... While the other guy shows that temperature did not actually increase.. I mean one of them most be wrong then... Or in this case: both are wrong. The increase in co2 in not due to a change in temperature but due to an increase in co2 in the atmosphere and the decrease in temperature is just local variation which we would expect anyway.

The whole el Nino argument does not make sense if you actually read the paper... There is a clear trend in the increase of co2 forcing in the data which does not follow the el Nino pattern... According to his argument forcing between 2002 and 2006 would have to been stable while the experiment shows that it increased.... Further more he repeats this "-80 degree can not warm earth" Bullshit showing again a total lack of understanding of basic thermodynamic...from a physical point of few co2 does reduce the net energy loss of the earth resulting in warming.... This is not the same as "a -80 degree body warms earth"... The argument is absurd. It's like saying " A mirror contradicts the second law of thermodynamic..

Similar point for showing climate change will be a disaster. Heck, 40 years is longer than the period of time in which we knew that HIV causes AIDS. Yet we still know that HIV has has disastrous effects for humans. Are you going to claim that's cherry-picking? Also, you're attacking a straw man if you think scientists are trying to claim that climate change something that the Earth hasn't seen before. Large-scale anthropogenic global warming, is something Earth has not seen before. Also, please don't wander into straw men about "catastrophic anthropogenic global warming"... "Polluted Discourse: Communication and Myths in a Climate of Denial [...] Additionally, we find that *catastrophic anthropogenic global warming* [CAGW] is essentially a term that is never used in the relevant scientific literature by mainstream sources. Furthermore, in the press it appears to be used exclusively by climate contrarians. The term is typically neither defined nor attributed to a mainstream scientific source. Our conclusion is therefore that CAGW is simply a *straw man* used by climate contrarians to criticize the mainstream position (50)." *"This makes sense only for proving that human action is to blame, not the other claims."* You mean the other claims which were straw men?

UgyJ4x5BT8FZrE1hUjx4AaABAg	1	1	2019-08-06 07:48:28	SlyGuy	I&#39;m from germany, and the problem is huge here. Naturally, our state/ government takes for ever to change things. Its just how we are as people here. The same goes for everyday life. I have countless friends who could EASILY ride the bike to work, or for gods sake, take the bus, but they just don&#39;t care. &quot;It&#39;s more convenient&quot; and &quot;I don&#39;t want to be sweaty when I arrive&quot; are just 2 out of many excuses I hear. Having a car is no problem. Use it for heavy groceries and visiting people you can&#39;t reach that easily otherwise. Speeding across the motorway with 220 km/h and driving 4km to work everyday is.<br /><br /><br />And that is just one example. I don&#39;t even want to start about the amount of energy we consumpt and how easily we could turn it down (just don&#39;t leave your charger plugged in, use reusable packagings, don&#39;t order too frequently on amazon etc.), but in my experience, people here are just too &quot;unaffected&quot; to change things. By that, I mean most of the people, not all. There are exceptions, but few.	UCQkaQe_7xM-he_Rw0-jfi_w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQkaQe_7xM-he_Rw0-jfi_w	0

Many people&#39;s should do agriculture and farming. Many people should study botany subject so that they have knowledge of plants and they should do farming and a book must be written about how much amount of food of any type a person should consume, to cook foods half or full, because if we eat too much of a thing then some problems arises due to that. The lands of the companies can be turned back to forests, trees can be planted or turned into a farm.<br /><br />12. To Stop Using Perfumes And Powders Which Is Not A Necessity<br /><br />Women&#39;s could simply keep a flower in their hair instead of using perfumes and powders. For men, it can&#39;t be helped. For bad smell in body both men and women should exercise and sweat, it would reduce the bad smell.<br />If you stop using perfumes and powders, we don&#39;t need perfume and powder manufacturing companies. So many perfume and powder bottles need not be manufactured, cartoon boxes need not be manufactured for packing them and transportations can be reduced. All of this would result in less pollution.<br /><br />13. Could We Stop Drinking Cow&#39;s and Buffalo&#39;s Milk<br /><br />Whatever vitamins and nutrients we get from milk, if we can get it from other eatable things, then we can stop drinking cow&#39;s and buffalo&#39;s milk. As milk has to be packed in glass bottles and plastic packs and then transported to places. All of this can be stopped. <br />For infants whose mother&#39;s have died or mother&#39;s who cannot breast feed their infants, only for them cow&#39;s and buffalo&#39;s milk should be given. We use milk in tea and coffee. Instead of milk we must use lime with tea and coffee. A lime should be cut into a few pieces and cooked with tea and coffee or something else can be used instead of lime.<br /><br />14. Medicines To Be Produced In A Different Way<br /><br />We manufacture tablet and syrup medicines in a manufacturing company. The tablet and syrup medicines have to be prepared in vast quantities and then tablets has to be packed in a packet and syrups in a bottle. Whatever the tablet and syrup medicines contain for any type of illness, they would have made it from some type of chemicals. Transportation is needed and many other things are also needed. The pollution and waste gases generated from these companies are so much. We should treat illness from natural foods, plants, leaves, fruits or grasses for small to medium types of illness. We should research what type of foods, plants, leaves, fruits or grasses should be given to eat to the ill person to cure their illnesses. The ill person would go to a doctor and the doctor would tell them what foods, etc., should be eaten so that their illness could get cured and how much amount of food has to be consumed. The person would buy those foods and consume it. Major or urgency types of illness for that we have to use allopathy only, as it may be risky for the patients with ayurvedic, homeopathic, and other forms of treatment. The world should research on this method and if this method works then we won&#39;t need so much medicines manufacturing companies, so much warehouses won&#39;t be needed to store the medicines, so much machines won&#39;t be needed to prepare the medicines, so much transportation won&#39;t be needed to transport the medicines to so many places and all the things related with it and so pollution could be avoided. We could turn all that places back to forests. These companies require so much boring underground water, the water when pumped out of the ground they flatten and sink the ground.<br />But we would need medicines manufacturing companies for things such as glucose bottles, syringes, injections and other things like that.<br /><br />15. A Manufacturing Company Which Is Not A Necessity For Human Beings, If It Is Stopped, Then We Have The Following Benefits<br /><br />When a manufacturing company which is not a necessity for human beings, if it is stopped, then we have the following benefits.<br />That company which is built in a place, that much land is saved, machines does not have to be manufactured, for machines to operate oil is needed and many other things, for which we have to make oil manufacturing company and all other companies for all other things like cartoon boxes, plastic ropes and plastic cans, registers, pencil, pen, stationery products. To make cartoon boxes papers are required and to stick papers gums are required. To make gums so much dough is needed and caustic soda is needed. If we don&#39;t manufacture cartoon boxes then that dough can be eaten. Transportation is needed to deliver things to all the shops. Roads have to be constructed. For transportation we need vehicles and to operate vehicles petrol is needed, to get petrol we have to set up oil rig platforms in the sea or land and to deliver petrol to a petrol pump that petrol is needed to be put in a drum, a plastic drum has to be manufactured and then many ships have to be manufactured for shipping the petrol to all the places. For all this works so much land is lost and so much pollution is created, from that pollution humans, land animals, sea animals, aerial animals and earth is suffering. Also many transportation items which requires huge trucks for transportation a driver has to drive only at night and his day life is lost. Surely at night time driving the driver would become sleepy sometimes and accidents do happen. <br />All of this can be reduced and this will be our benefits if we stopped a manufacturing company which is not a necessity for human beings. When you stop making a manufacturing company then all the problems related with it won&#39;t occur.<br /><br />16. Why We Should Manufacture Less Nutrient Foods Like Horlicks And Bournvita<br /><br />Bournvita, Horlicks should be given to only persons who cannot exercise and are too weak. For others who have deficiency and are not too weak, they should eat natural foods and exercise so that the foods would get absorbed well in their body and their deficiency would be alright. If still they cannot exercise and get tired easily, they could do some light exercises or yoga in their spare time which would take long to get tired. If this is done, we won&#39;t have to prepare so many horlicks, bournvita and other nutrients foods like that. So then we don&#39;t have to prepare the plastic, glass or paper pack bottles and hence less pollution.<br /><br />17. To Reduce Television Time<br /><br />Television programs is for 24 hours a day. A human works for 8 hours a day, 1 hour for getting ready in the morning, travelling time assume for 2 hours a day, half an hour would be spent in relaxing, talking to friend&#39;s for half an hour, talking with family for half an hour, 1 hour spent in a park and sleeping time for 6 hours. Altogether 19 and half hours are spent for weekdays. So only 4 and half hours are left. In that why television is then for 24 hours. Well non working women&#39;s and students going to schools and colleges have extra free time. As television is for 24 hours now, then many students instead of spending their time in studying watch television more and study less. Non working women’s in their free time instead of watching television could do some other activities. Television should be shown in evening from 7pm to 8pm, cartoon shows should be shown for kids at that time. From 8pm to 9pm teenagers programs should be shown. From 9pm to 11pm programs should be shown for grown-up peoples. If you watch colour television for more than 2 hours, the rays coming from television affects your health and eyes.<br /><br />At present due to problems going on in the world, 24 hours news channels are required. So we can keep news channels for 24 hours.

Why are people like you hired to give high school level explanations for one of the most complex issues of our day? If you want to know what real science looks like then start following astrophysics and cosmology. That is in fact “science.” There are many actual real scientists who trot out the equations and the hypothesis and discuss their models in detail. You sir are a very good PR expert. Not a scientist.

I had a political discussion on FB with an old high school teacher of mine(graphic design). He was a very nice man but it is easy to see he was a conservative and strong in biblical beliefs. This is what he said to me about climate change.<br />&quot;Genesis <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjIyms1BX4&amp;t=8m22s">8:22</a> is pretty black and white. Interpretation not needed. It goes on to tell us later that their will be weather occurrences and seismic activity that is predestined by the great I Am in the last days. Too me, it suspends common sense to think the replacing a heavy-weight liquid like oil with a lighter weight liquid like water is compatible. I wholly agree we contribute to Earth&#39;s physical change in that regard. He also says that He controls our weather.

As for sun spots, you do know they interact with cosmic rays which in turn affect albedo? This is well known, has been since Herschel identified a correlation between sun spot activity and wheat production, Svensmark and CERN have added more understanding to that,."* Neither TSI nor sunspots nor cosmic rays caused most of the global warming since the mid-20th centuries. Anthropogenic greenhouse gases did. Do your homework, denialist. Climate scientists know that the sun did not cause the recent global warming, while anthropogenic greenhouse gases did cause the recent warming. Here's NASA dumbing it down for you: "Is the sun causing global warming? No. The sun can influence the Earth’s climate, but it isn’t responsible for the warming trend we’ve seen over the past few decades. The sun is a giver of life; it helps keep the planet warm enough for us to survive. We know subtle changes in the Earth’s orbit around the sun are responsible for the comings and goings of the ice ages. But the warming we’ve seen over the last few decades is too rapid to be linked to changes in Earth’s orbit, and too large to be caused by solar activity. In fact, recently (2005-2010) the sun has become less active, while temperatures have marched upwards. One of the “smoking guns” that tells us the sun is not causing global warming comes from looking at the amount of the sun’s energy that hits the top of the atmosphere. Since 1978, scientists have been tracking this using sensors on satellites and what they tell us is that there has been no upward trend in the amount of the sun’s energy reaching Earth. A second smoking gun is that if the sun were responsible for global warming, we would expect to see warming throughout all layers of the atmosphere, from the surface all the way up to the upper atmosphere (stratosphere). But what we actually see is warming at the surface and cooling in the stratosphere. This is consistent with the warming being caused by a build-up of heat-trapping gases near the surface of the Earth, and not by the sun getting “hotter.”" http://climate.nasa.gov/faq/? "But several lines of evidence show that current global warming cannot be explained by changes in energy from the sun: - Since 1750, the average amount of energy coming from the sun either remained constant or increased slightly. - If the warming were caused by a more active sun, then scientists would expect to see warmer temperatures in all layers of the atmosphere. Instead, they have observed a cooling in the upper atmosphere, and a warming at the surface and in the lower parts of the atmosphere. That's because greenhouse gases are trapping heat in the lower atmosphere. - Climate models that include solar irradiance changes can’t reproduce the observed temperature trend over the past century or more without including a rise in greenhouse gases." http://climate.nasa.gov/causes/ And here are some scientific papers showing that the sun did not cause most of the recent global warming: "Causes of the Global Warming Observed since the 19th Century" "Evidence of recent causal decoupling between solar radiation and global temperature" "Solar trends and global warming" "Small influence of solar variability on climate over the past millennium" "Quantifying the role of solar radiative forcing over the 20th century" "Unusual activity of the Sun during recent decades compared to the previous 11,000 years" "Solar variability and global warming: a statistical comparison since 1850" "Can solar variability explain global warming since 1970?" Though cosmic rays likely influenced climate in the past, cosmic rays did not cause the recent global warming period, i.e. the global warming since the mid-20th century. This is discussed in scientific sources you're ignorant of, such as: "Cosmic rays, solar activity and the climate" "Dynamical evidence for causality between galactic cosmic rays and interannual variation in global temperature" "Reply to Luo et al.: Robustness of causal effects of galactic cosmic rays on interannual variation in global temperature" "Global atmospheric particle formation from CERN CLOUD measurements" *"As for what you say, the theory that WV increase at 7%/K is just a theory, and has not actually happened. If you look at all data sets there has been no SH increase associated with the recent warming."* Bertie Blue and I already corrected your fabrications on this long ago. Stop repeating your distortions. Try to address Bertie Blue's point in an intellectually honest manner: "The only claims for 7% have nothing to do with specific humidity." "Link 4 (Google book): This says that the SATURATION VAPOUR PRESSURE increases at a rate of 7% per Kelvin, NOT the specific humidity. This is NOT a claim of global warming - it is an experimentally verified fact. If you place water in a sealed container, the vapour pressure in the sealed space above the water will rise at 7% per Kelvin. It is the MAXIMUM vapour pressure - the actual vapour pressure will only equal that when the relative humidity is 100%. The saturation vapour pressure is used to calculate the RELATIVE humidity. It is the WATER HOLDING CAPACITY which increases at 7% per Kelvin, NOT the actual quantity of water in the atmosphere. Yes, if relative humidity were to remain the same under warming, then that would mean specific humidity would also increase by 7%. But the prediction is that relative humidity will DECREASE under warming. The predicted increase for SPECIFIC humidity is 1-3%." "So you refuse to learn the difference between "saturation vapour pressure" and "specific humidity". Trenbath's paper: " water holding capacity of air increases by about 7% per 1°C warming" (your 4th link uses the same teminology). As I already explained, water holding capacity is the ability of the atmosphere to hold water vapour, NOT the amount of water vapour it actually holds. As average relative humidity FALLS (as predicted), the actual quantity of water vapour in the air will rise by LESS than 7%." Anyway, the expected changes in water vapor occurred. AGW began predominantly in the mid-to-late 1970s, and was preceded by global cooling from the 1940s to the 1970s. Scientists observed the expected increase in atmospheric moisture over the relevant time-frame of 1980 - 2010, when the warming is most pronounced: "Increasing evidence from observations and climate models indicates that anthropogenic activity is increasing atmospheric moisture (Boucher et al. 2004; Willett et al. 2007; Santer et al. 2007; Min et al. 2008). [...] Most studies of global atmospheric moisture indicate that recent warming is associated with an increase in specific humidity and little change in relative humidity (Dai 2006; Trenberth et al. 2007; Willett et al. 2008). A more recent analysis suggests that reductions in relative humidity have occurred because of a lack of increase in oceanic moisture being supplied to warming land surfaces (Simmons et al. 2010). [...] Hourly temperatures in the United States have warmed since 1930, with much of this warming occurring since 1980. [...] There have been no long-term changes in dewpoint temperatures or specific humidity but rather there has been a decreasing (1947–79) and then an increasing (1980–2010) trend in both variables." http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/JAMC-D-12-035.1 *"And no, clouds are not a net +ve feedback, you are wrong"* Stop being in denialist of the evidence. Clouds can act as positive feedback or negative feddback, though on the whole they are a net positive feedback: "Evidence for climate change in the satellite cloud record [...] Our results suggest that radiative forcing by a combination of anthropogenic greenhouse gases and volcanic aerosol has produced observed cloud changes during the past several decades that exert positive feedbacks on the climate system." "A net decrease in the Earth’s cloud, aerosol, and surface 340 nm reflectivity during the past 33 yr (1979–2011) [...] The amount of the longwave offset plus changes in atmospheric absorption determine whether the cloud plus aerosol change represents a net positive or negative feedback. The correlated increase in surface temperature suggests a net positive feedback." "Thermodynamic control of anvil cloud amount [...] Compelling physical arguments, with varying degrees of observational support, suggest that cloud changes with warming constitute a net positive feedback on radiative forcing (6). Two main contributors to this positive feedback are an expected reduction of low-level cloud amount (7??–10) and a rise of high-level clouds (11, 12). Some arguments have also been advanced for negative feedbacks that would reduce the sensitivity of Earth’s temperature to perturbations, through for instance a greater preponderance of liquid in clouds at warmer temperatures (13) or, for reasons that are unclear, a reduction in the relative area of the wet, vs. dry, tropics with warming (14, 15)."

High clouds have only a small impact on the net cloud feedback because of a close cancellation between large LW and SW cloud feedbacks." "A net decrease in the Earth’s cloud, aerosol, and surface 340 nm reflectivity during the past 33 yr (1979–2011) [...] The amount of the longwave offset plus changes in atmospheric absorption determine whether the cloud plus aerosol change represents a net positive or negative feedback.

This positive feedback is discussed in sources such as: "Observational determination of albedo decrease caused by vanishing Arctic sea ice" "Estimating the global radiative impact of the sea ice–albedo feedback in the Arctic" "The central role of diminishing sea ice in recent Arctic temperature amplification" *"In summary, we do know it is getting warmer, we do know we are contributing to that, but the effect is small and therefore entirely beneficial"* Nope. Numerous scientists know the following (hence the scientific consensus these): A1) There has been global warming since the mid-20th century. A2) Humans (largely via anthropogenic greenhouse gases) caused most of this recent warming. A3) Most of the recent (or near future) climate change is (or will be) caused by humans. A4) Climate change is a serious problem and/or a danger to humanity. The consensus on A1 and A2 is discussed in: "Consensus on consensus: a synthesis of consensus estimates on human-caused global warming" The consensus on A3 and A4 is discussed in: http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/07/23/elaborating-on-the-views-of-aaas-scientists-issue-by-issue/ "The Bray and von Storch 5th International Survey of Climate Scientists 2015/2016" The following sources provide scientific evidence on A1 and A2 (there are at least *50* scientific papers providing evidence on A2): "Causes of the Global Warming Observed since the 19th Century" "Attribution of observed historical near-surface temperature variations to anthropogenic and natural causes using CMIP5 simulations" "Anthropogenic and natural warming inferred from changes in Earth’s energy balance" "Attributing Observed SST Trends and Subcontinental Land Warming to Anthropogenic Forcing during 1979–2005" "Sensitivity of the attribution of near surface temperature warming to the choice of observational dataset" "A probabilistic quantification of the anthropogenic component of twentieth century global warming" "Identifying human influences on atmospheric temperature" "Quantifying anthropogenic influence on recent near-surface temperature change" "Evidence for external forcing on 20th-century climate from combined ocean-atmosphere warming patterns" "Observed 21st century temperatures further constrain likely rates of future warming" And the reason for the consensus on A4, is that there's abundant scientific research showing that anthropogenic climate change has caused (or will cause): - increased heat-related mortality (which outweighs any decreases in cold-related mortality) - increased drought intensity - economic losses from sea level rise - increased hurricane intensity - ocean acidification (which results in things such as loss of marine crops and marine food) - reduced crop yields and so on. Here's some research on this, to get you started: "A meta-analysis of crop yield under climate change and adaptation" "Climate Change: Impact on Agriculture and Costs of Adaptation" "Ocean Acidification: The Other CO2 Problem" "Nutrition and income from molluscs today imply vulnerability to ocean acidification tomorrow" "Economic impacts of climate change in Europe: sea-level rise" "Economic losses from US hurricanes consistent with an influence from climate change" "Tropical cyclones and climate change" "Anthropogenic warming has increased drought risk in California" "Contribution of anthropogenic warming to California drought during 2012–2014" "Increasing drought under global warming in observations and models" "Global warming and changes in drought" "Climate warming will not decrease winter mortality" "Winter season mortality: will climate warming bring benefits?"

In the medieval times the temperature was about as warm(maybe even warmer) as in the times that we are living in now. Do you think that people in the medieval times used machines and all that stuff that caused CO2? There are so many factors in climate. climate change is natural. I believe that we have become a factor in climate but not the reason for climate to change like this. search on google images: &quot;ice times temperature graph&quot; you can see that it happened before.

My comment could have been better focused had I included that it is more likely that American Government and sponsored Special Interest organizations research statistics often ignore Methane impact on global climate change. Here is a quote from: onegreenplanet.org "Focusing on carbon emissions is only half the battle – or 74 percent of total emissions to be exact – but, focusing on the percentage of total emissions is extremely misleading because it ignores global warming potential altogether. We’ve seen that methane, which accounts for only 14 percent of emissions worldwide, traps up to 100 times more heat than carbon dioxide over a 5-year period. This means that even though carbon dioxide molecules outnumber methane 5 to 1, this comparatively smaller amount of methane is still 19 times greater a problem for climate change over a 5 year period, and 4 times greater over a 100 year period. To put it another way, any methane molecule released today is 100 times more heat-trapping than a molecule of carbon dioxide, or potentially even higher according to NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies. With the UN establishing various tipping points for irreversible climate change damage on the horizon, it’s time that methane enters mainstream consideration. And better yet, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that livestock production is responsible for 14.5 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, while other organizations like the Worldwatch Institute have estimated it could be as much as 51 percent – it’s time that we look beyond our gas tanks and on to our plates."

For example: 1) CO2 is more abundant in the atmosphere. 2) Bacteria break down much of the methane to form CO2. 3) CO2 has a longer atmospheric residence time than methane, since methane readily reacts with other molecules higher in the atmosphere. 4) Methane levels, and methane's impact energy balance, have begun leveling off, while CO2 levels and impact continue to increase. 5) Methane ends up being responsible for a minority of the anthropogenic impact on energy balance, with CO2 making up the majority. I cite some scientific evidence for each of these points right before figure 4 in section 2.3 of: "+Myth: Attributing Warming to CO2 Involves the Fallaciously Inferring Causation from a Mere Correlation" http://blamethenoctambulantjoycean.blogspot.ca/2018/04/myth-attributing-warming-to-co2.html Also see: *"Methane is the second most abundant GHG after carbon dioxide (CO2),* accounting for 14 percent of global emissions. Though methane is emitted into the atmosphere in smaller quantities than CO2 , its global warming potential (i.e., the ability of the gas to trap heat in the atmosphere) is 25 times greater. As a result, *methane emissions currently contribute more than one-third of today’s anthropogenic warming."* https://www.globalmethane.org/documents/analysis_fs_en.pdf "Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas, with a global warming potential that is far greater than that of carbon dioxide, particularly over the time horizon of the first few decades following emission. [...] *Methane is a far more potent GHG than is CO2, but methane also has a tenfold shorter residence time in the atmosphere, so its effect on global warming attenuates more rapidly* (IPCC 2007)." http://www.jlcny.org/site/attachments/article/561/Howarth%20Report%202.pdf	UCWZGVxHPDNenYs5mkxjUwhA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWZGVxHPDNenYs5mkxjUwhA	1	Ugws1tf0RBIJP_LVWEJ4AaABAg	1dir

(I say most likely because its not 100%.. but more like 90% proven, close enough for me, I say that because we didn't have the means to measure a lot of things back then) ok, so now we come to the heart of the problem, CO2 does not act in the way that most people believes it does, CO2 absorbs only very specific wavelengths, 2.7, 4.3, and 15 microns, once absorbed it then radiates them in every direction almost instantly (this happens in 83 femtoseconds) in completely different wavelength that fluctuates but the average is about 25 microns, meaning they are not re absorbed by other CO2 molecules, with the current amount of CO2 this all happens in about 10 meters, meaning that those 3 wavelengths never make it to the ground... then once IR reflects off the ground... those three wavelengths make it about 10M off the ground before they are all absorbed and changed into another wavelength... thus all of the suns energy absorbed during the day leaves through the atmosphere during the night. if we where to double the amount of CO2 the same process would happen in about 5M instead of 10M I can explain this mathematically if you wish. what does this really mean? CO2 does not act in the way that the media says it does, and there is nothing about global warming that is alarming, also no change we do to impact CO2 (increase or decrease) will have any real impact to global warming, (there is an exception to this... but would mean we would need to see a HUGE increase in plant life, thus increasing the water vapor that is constantly in the atmosphere) ... I can expound on anything you want ... let me know.	UCmOAzTHRkmGRCpcQs5r3JBA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmOAzTHRkmGRCpcQs5r3JBA	1	Ugw3Bd1trp7QY8wiPSx4AaABAg	Edward Hunt

The debate isn't over the planets atmosphere warning, Christy's position has been over the rate of warming claimed by the IPCC's climate models. A number of claims have been made about an increase of hurricanes, tornadoes, and now forest fires due to global warming and yet the records for the past 120 years show a decline for them all. It's the foolish hype people fall for that is amazing. Here is how stupid a number of the people in the world are. The progressives of the world now say solar energy is cheaper than fossil fuels. If that were the case companies and people would be buying solar panels as fast as they could but they are not. I'm pretty sure communist China doesn't allow the fossil fuel industry to dictate what type of energy to use. It is my understanding China is the largest producer of solar panels and yet they complete a coal fired power plant every 10-14 days. Ask yourself, why is Germany building a pipeline from Russia to Germany if solar is so cheep and reliable? One thing that is good about people, if they see the oceans rising and threatening their home, they will pick up and move. Are you paying attention to the weather events that have been impacting farmers for the past two years? Did you know weather events are associated with climate change? For the past two growing seasons, farmers are planting later and harvesting earlier due to snow storms. If the planet is warming , why the shortened growing season, shouldn't summers be growing longer? A number of scientists have predicated a change (cooling) in our climate with the new solar cycle.

BUT WHEN OTHERS, INCLUDING CARL MEARS, A SENIOR RESEARCH SCIENTIST AT THE RESEARCH COMPANY "REMOTE SENSING SYSTEMS", RE-EXAMINED CHRIST'S WORK IN THE EARLY 2000S, THEY FOUND ERRORS THAT WHEN CORRECTED REVEALED WARMING IN THE TROPOSPHERE. CHRISTY ACKNOWLEDGED THE ERROR, ACCORDING TO THE NY TIMES. AS RECENTLY AS 2017, MULTIPLE SCIENTISTS CORRECTED AND RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT HOW CHRISTY'S TEAM WAS ANALYSING DATA.... And I could go on and on. Please stop polluting with inaccuracies.	UCsYupKQPnWV7J3FUsGGwyEA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsYupKQPnWV7J3FUsGGwyEA	1	UgySLTFQc1ElbXz1HDx4AaABAg	L Pappas

There are a lot of people who don&#39;t notice that because most people can&#39;t remember yesterday let alone last season. People don&#39;t believe things they can&#39;t see... I&#39;m amazed that the average person accepts the Earth travels around the sun... which is not the way it appears to happen.

If you are as aware of all the corruption in this world and brainwashing that we are subjected to by mainstream sources, you will find your answers on the internet, many of which are right here on YouTube. Seek the truth with an open mind and you will find. Start with the fact that no one has proven scientifically, that CO2 increases cause climate warming or that climate warming causes CO2 to be released. I have read that ice core samples show that warming is a precursor to CO2 levels rising. Look for yourself. Either way, the 97% percent of scientists agree line is a fallacy created by one guy. We have too much to lose economically and a few shady individuals and entities have a lot to gain based on science that is not agreed upon. Is is the very same mentality as senator Nancy Pelosi&#39;s statement that we should &quot;sign the bill first and then read it&quot;. This asinine mentality is why I don&#39;t trust virtually any so-called leadership in this country.	UCORRT89nGtLmowlGXpkJEfw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCORRT89nGtLmowlGXpkJEfw	0

Just because you do not know, for example, how the sunspot activity could affect the climate does not mean that the correlation is not meaningful. You cannot judge in decades,these trends are only understandable in 100s or 10000s of years. &#39;Facts&#39; are not enough, you need to have theoretical constructs that make sense of observations otherwise you do not know if they are relevant...stay curious, stop evangelising and learn some science	UCMInSMvYNDokzXjErBt6oZw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMInSMvYNDokzXjErBt6oZw	0

How do I know? IT DIDN'T SNOW AT CHRISTMAS 2 TIMES IN A ROW IN NORWAY. Before it snowed in September. CO2 is known to trap heat. Everyone who have used studies to prove their point of view has always concluded with global warming being true.

Its misinformed notion that icebergs are static through out the year. They melt almost to the half the size in summer and grow back to full size in winter. There is small is net difference between the size in winter with size in winter of previous year but that difference is smll and not rapid. Rapid melt down is between winter and summer followed by rapid ice growth. The estimation on greenland is that winter ice will get to 50% of its size in winter in 12 000 years. In another words the Ice will be here longer than we will. And thats science. So if they start the video like that I dont want to see rest of it. Their respect and credibility is lost right there.

The absolute worst thing you can do is act like someone is stupid just for being wrong once. Educate, inform, but don&#39;t make people believe. If you&#39;re right, they&#39;ll believe because of the facts. If not, get over it. They just don&#39;t believe. It&#39;s not your job to determine what they believe, and doesn&#39;t really matter whether they&#39;re right or not either.

As much as I&#39;m aware of the problems we create for the environment these days, I also wondered if the change in the climate could be part of a weather cycle which began before man walked the earth.

UghGhXyvGPsGKHgCoAEC	0	0	2014-12-09 18:48:17	dbuck53	I resisted my urge to unsubscribe, and decided instead to air some of my thoughts on the matter.  I am not looking the argue the merits of global climate change as a done deal, just show why someone like me doesn&#39;t care much about it.  I pasted the following from the notepad in which I wrote it. It was not proof-read. I didn&#39;t want to find myself re-wording and re-toning what came off the top of my head:<br /><br /><br />Hmm, why do people have trouble with the facts about climate change? Let&#39;s see, since the 1970s I have heard these predictions presented as though they were a fact. To name just a few:<br /><br />1) We will be in the next ice age within 20 years (1970-72 global freezing)<br />2) The human population is now unsustainable, starvation will kill off most of our population in the next 20 years (around 1974)<br />3) &quot;The oceans will be dead in 20 years&quot; (Ted Dansen psa around 1990)<br />4) We will flat run out of oil in 10 years (around 1972 during the gas rationing crunch)<br /><br />There are many others I haven&#39;t listed. Much of it fueled by the same human drive for recognition many people yearn to have, and a driving need for the media to be the first with bad news. And credibility in the global climate area of science has suffered to an embarassing degree. Right now, it sucks.<br /><br />I love science. I enjoy reading layman&#39;s books by physicist and cosmologist, even geologist. I favorite all-time book on science is &quot;A Short History of Nearly Everything&quot; by Bill Bryson, a non-scientist but exacting author. In spite of that, I find the global weather alarmist community suspect.<br /><br />Consensus means squat. It used to be a concensus that black holes were black, emitting nothing. It was a consensus that the universal expansion was slowing due to gravitational effects.  That there were four dimensions, one universe, or that the UCLA Bruins basketball team could never lose.  Consensus changes as facts continue to accrue. Global climatologist keep jumping the gun with pronouncements that don&#39;t come true.<br /><br />Al Gore writes a book for profit on the subject, then helps design and carbon credit system to primarily make him richer.  People gripe about it from the comfort of their air-conditioned houses, on their electric-powered computers and global internet system.  They drive their cars, mow their lawns, consume whatever they want, and yelp that someone needs to do something.  The global weather science is caught on email fudging facts to keep the worry factor high (nothing to do with chasing grant money I suppose). Even the term &quot;global warming&quot; had to be replaced with climate change to give more room for error.<br /><br />Yes, climate change may be coming more rapidly than ever before, but what are you personally going do about it?  High human population is the problem, right?  Are you going to give up all your conveniences and live down on a subsistence farm?  Are you going to demand that wealthy politicians do the same?  Will you eat at a near starvation level? Never drive an internal combustion vehicle again? Give up all plastics and other oil-derived products? Or any of the endless other self-depriving solutions?<br /><br />Will you volunteer to give up your life to reduce the over-population?<br /><br />I personally won&#39;t change my ways, but I really don&#39;t care about the potential problem. My life is nearing the end and it won&#39;t really affect me.<br /><br />Is it even a solvable problem?  The human race has reach the current level of success by cleverly manipulating the evironment for it&#39;s own betterment.  At first it was a survival trait that helped make the species more persistent than it&#39;s competitors. Eventually that trait has become the drive to comfort.  Can we change to dump this behavioral trait? Is it genetically hard-wired into our behavior overall?  Maybe, just maybe, we should start considering the possibility that the human species, like all other species, has a limited life span too. Just saying.	UCC_dI_ASE5inhiPT3bsbkcA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC_dI_ASE5inhiPT3bsbkcA	0

CO2 reduction would lead to less isolation (but only in centuries). Alternatively, we could paint mountains white and install solar panels on every roof. This would reduce the addition of energy to the system. Solar panels, because they reflect more sunlight back than normal roof tiles. However, this is not really cooling the earth, it is just reflecting new energy out of the system. You could send up a satellite to the Lagrange point between earth and sun where is explodes and emits some sort of dust or reflective particle blocking the sun, but you would need to create a really large area with all the particles. The result would be less sunlight which would also have a negative effect on oxygen production by plants and may even increase CO2.

I have sought such for over ten years now without finding even one solid bit of peer-reviewed, published research which supports your claims. Some of your claims are just silly; the ocean levels, for instance, have NOT risen 8 inches since the start of the century; they have risen about one centimetre. Arctic ice has expanded, not contracted, although different years can see it doing either for that year. And the planet has cooled or remained unchanged during the last 19 years. <br /><br />THESE are facts. They can be checked by anyone, including you. Only a real religious fanatic of the Church of Anthropological Global Warming can, and will, ignore the facts as put forward in scientific research papers and continue to flat out lie, as you are doing.<br /><br />You alarmists are very fond of saying, &quot;Go with the science&quot;.

Just think about electricity, batteries (especially how inefficient they are), and the main fact that they get the energy they store from fossil fuels (coal at best, natural gas has a whole different story with its GHG environmental impacts). <br /><br />As a PhD in Biology - you have no background in environmental science related to air quality so you should not sacrifice your credibility by trying to justify your interpretation on the subject as fact. I really enjoyed your other recent videos related to biology/evolution (your forte I presume).<br /><br />Reply if you would like to discuss further.

As a science writer in paleoecology, I have one question with your pt #7. 400 ppm is the highest in more than 2 million years (as inferred from pollen data in Siberia and ocean sediment isotopes). The 800,000 years you show on your chart is simply as far back an ice record we can get by drilling in Antarctica -- so that is the oldest direct measurements. But paleoecologists reliably infer 400 ppm was during the Pliocene. Back then, there were conifer trees in what is now Siberian tundra and there were camels on Baffin Island.  I produced a youtube video on this. Go directly to the section on Julie Brigham-Grette. The video title is &quot;Hot Climate Women Scientists in Cool Places.&quot;<br /><br />Keep up the great work -- and I am eager to watch how you handle part 2 of the climate issue: the psychological framework as to why people will not accept the science.

This issue is so weird because there&#39;s no significant, if any, religious reason to deny the science. Even if one believes in god I think it&#39;s abundantly clear that bad things happen and climate change is &quot;just&quot; another bad thing, albeit extremely bad. With almost no exceptions, the average person has nothing personal to lose by exploring new sources of energy. It&#39;s only oil and related companies that are fighting against the science they absolutely know is real. For goodness sake, the most important people who work for oil companies are scientists and many of them are geologists who don&#39;t doubt the facts of climate change. The only people who don&#39;t accept the reality is the ignorant public policy companies have managed to scam. And then it became a political issue so those who have some clue don&#39;t care because now it&#39;s all about making sure liberals don&#39;t get their way. I wish the fight was over how to solve the problem rather than arguing if a problem actually exists. It&#39;s insane that adults are debating the equivalent of what color was George Washington&#39;s white horse. It&#39;s crazy. This shouldn&#39;t be something we debate. The same people who deny climate change take advantage of scientific discoveries made possible by the very same method used to understand climate change, sometimes by the same scientists. How odd.

My question to them is why would god do that? What does he gain by giving us a challenge and saving us when we do nothing about it? I believe that the only way God will save a person is if that person actually did something beneficial to the situation. People have the tendency to think god will save them no matter what but my philosophy is that we humans must come up with the solution and god will help us along the way! And i completely agree with your statement "The fight should be over the solution to the problem not weather that problem exists." People these days only care about them selves arguing a point that is beneficial to themselves the only way to not have argument is to not have a bias and to think of the world as one person, as a group, solving problems that would benefit the world not just themselves.

UgjHAQT3d1QocngCoAEC	0	2	2016-01-02 00:04:45	Consult Keith Young	Another video using ad-hominems which acts as though it is definitive but is not.<br /><br />Please, rather than making &quot;deniers&quot; look stupid, convince them with enough evidence.<br /><br />If you want people to change their behavior you must first demonstrate you are correct. So do it, rather than making them look stupid and leaving holes in your theory. I am not saying you are wrong, what I am saying is you&#39;re leaving holes in this video.<br /><br />So let me begin...<br /><br />Sun is source - yep<br />Some reflected, some absorbed - yep<br />But human activities have increased... - NOW is where you need to start proving it<br />40% - Evidence please, this is important, don&#39;t leave gaps in your theory if you want to convince people<br />Temp vs Solar Activity - I don&#39;t personally study this, so for the sake of argument I&#39;ll give you that one<br />Upper lower levels together - Again, I&#39;ll just give you this one<br />2000 gigatons - Great, now tell me how much CO2 was added by other sources. Tell me how many other greenhouse gases were contributed by us vs cycles. Want to convince a skeptic? Don&#39;t leave holes in your theory.<br />2 million million tons - Don&#39;t be an alarmist, don&#39;t assume I am stupid. Rather, simply compare the 2000 gigatons to something to give the skeptic an idea of what percentage of climate change is caused by people.<br />Ice Cores - Sorry, but with these current holes you haven&#39;t shown that humans caused this. I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re wrong, I&#39;m saying you need to fill these holes to convince skeptics.<br />Uncharted territory etc - More alarmist stuff. Give the skeptics some facts. Show the linearity. In all experiments I did I tried for at least 5 measurements in order to show the linear/exponential relations of what I was measuring. Show at least 5 measurements in those ice cores. Don&#39;t alarm me. Facts sway me, not that.<br />Temperatures increase - Yes. But you have yet to convince me through this video that humans are the cause due to the holes in your theory.<br />10X FASTER - Holy cow well now you convinced me. You scared me in to believing you.<br />How do we know it&#39;s our fault - FINALLY, THANK YOU<br />Isotopes - OK cool bring it on. Convince the skeptics with evidence.<br />Fossil fuels from old plants - I don&#39;t study this, but I think it&#39;s true and will give you this one<br />12 vs 13 - Again, this isn&#39;t my field so I&#39;ll give you this one<br />12 should go up - Well sure, but is it the only source of 12? I hope you cover this in the next minute or you just left another huge hole in your &quot;proof&quot;<br />And that&#39;s exactly what we see - I&#39;m not stupid. Don&#39;t give me garbage. Realize I am smart enough to have arguments in my mind, I am skeptical of everything and am only convinced through reason and evidence. Address the other sources of 12. Address how much 12. Don&#39;t leave a hole in your proof.<br />It&#39;s not because of volcanic activity - Good, please tell me you&#39;re going to address these arguments.<br />1% as much CO2 - I don&#39;t study this. This is one I am less likely to just assume you are right. I am also curious how much is 12 vs 13. Hopefully you cover this in the next few seconds.<br />Balance etc - Bleh don&#39;t diverge, go over how you know, go over the 12 vs 13. Don&#39;t leave these holes in your theory sit back there and grow and allow my skepticism to remain. Convince the skeptic.<br />Methane - OK so you&#39;re hopefully starting to answer a question I had probably about 2 minutes ago. PLEASE make a strong logical chain to convince me.<br />Simulations - Groan. This is so little information how am I supposed to handle this? We simulate cooling - I can only assume next you&#39;re going to say BUT INSTEAD IT&#39;S GETTING WARMER, I can predict what you&#39;re going to say. How are you going to back it up. Who ran the simulation? What assumptions were made? Where is the peer reviewed writeup? Don&#39;t just brush over something like this.<br />And that is not what&#39;s happening - Well there we go. Please don&#39;t back this up with another insult.<br />Derp I have no teeth, it snowed, derp - Groan<br />Twice as many record highs as lows - Interesting fact. Thank you. But you&#39;ve yet to convince me through this video that humans are the cause. Make a strong logical chain to convince a skeptic.<br />Warmer - Well thanks for that observation. Heaven forbid instead of saying crap like this you address the other gigatons, the 12 vs 13, the simulation, if this is so important can&#39;t you spend the time to make a video that actually addresses arguments? Few would argue it is getting warmer. Facepalm. PLEASE tell me you&#39;re going to address these things and I haven&#39;t wasted 4 minutes of my life.<br />A full degree - If you&#39;re trying to alarm me at least do a better job than this.<br />Warmest in 8 centuries - Enough of this. Show me the 12 vs 13, show me the simulation in more detail, tell me how many gigatons are related to cycles, just fill the gaps in your arguments.<br /><br />At this point my fingers are getting tired and I have other things to accomplish tonight. So I won&#39;t go point by point and I&#39;ll just say whether you addressed any of the gaps you left. Again, I&#39;m not saying you&#39;re wrong. I&#39;m saying that if you want to convince a skeptic you need to show a complete logic chain that can hold together when subjected to the slightest tug.<br /><br />Sorry fingers, I lied:<br />Up 8 inches since 1901 - PLEASE tell me you&#39;re going to show how many inches it would have been if humans didn&#39;t exist. PLEASE tell me you&#39;re going to in some way use this to prove humans are a significant contributor to rising sea levels.<br />Calcium shells - Thank you I didn&#39;t actually know that. Interesting thing to know. BUT you&#39;ve yet to convince me of humans contribution.<br />Current trends, warmer - ...and now you&#39;re going to say &quot;but without humans, that would only be 0.5 degrees or something&quot;. Sorry again for more sarcasm. Can&#39;t help myself.<br />Bad Time - Thank you for at least giving me a laugh.<br /><br />And now you&#39;re acting like you proved something. Facepalm.<br /><br />So let me summarize:<br /><br />To convince a skeptic, avoid insults, and instead create a chain of logic strong enough to handle a slight tug. In your case there are complete links in this chain missing.<br /><br />One link in your chain is showing the proportion of gigatons. Instead of treating me like I am a complete moron, imagine that I&#39;d like to know what percentage of total CO2 that is annually. Give me some form of comparison.<br /><br />Another is 12 vs 13. You never really covered this in the level of detail it would take to tie this together. Other sources of 12? Time graph of 12? Anything? NO.<br /><br />Another weak link in your chain, the simulation. Don&#39;t just brush over this so briefly.<br /><br />Again, I am not saying you&#39;re wrong. What I am saying is that when I made up a new equation describing how a new type of aircraft would behave (this sentence is simplified) I showed every step of my derivation. I questioned the result. I checked my units. I made sure that every single step in my derivation was correct and in a logical order. I listed my assumptions thoroughly. What I didn&#39;t do was alarm the equation reader person (whatever you call them) in to believing it. I laid out a strong sequence. I addressed arguments against my equation.<br /><br />For the love, seriously, drop the insults and lay out a strong argument that will actually convince a skeptic. Convince me. Convince the skeptic. Lay this out in a way that is so well documented and proven that only the hopelessly illogical and mental gymnastics gold medalists can refute your claim. Don&#39;t leave giant gaping holes in your chain. If this is so important, take the time to actually convince people rather than insulting them.<br /><br />Less insults, more strong logic and evidence.<br /><br />Sorry, I wrote this &quot;quickly&quot; and didn&#39;t proof read. Please understand that each line I wrote was based only really on what you had said up to that point in the video.<br /><br />It would be great if people could comment and fill these gaps. What would be better is if someone could make a strong convincing video with no holes in the logic that would take say 10-20 minutes, with links to more information.<br /><br />Get with it people. Stop insulting. Start convincing.	UCmgmchR_AXy49N8bO_yilVQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmgmchR_AXy49N8bO_yilVQ	0

UghzcZa9n7n2OHgCoAEC	0	0	2014-12-09 11:45:29	Polygon Gaming	This didn&#39;t change my mind. It failed in a few ways (though I&#39;m still a fan of the show as a whole!)<br /><br />Correlation is not causation. Causation has not been proven, only correlation, but even then it has been 1400 years, according to this video, since the Arctic was so small. Were human beings burning fossil fuels then? No. Did the Earth (and humanity) recover? Yes. Was the world hotter 65m years ago in the reign of the dinosaurs? Yes. Were there significantly higher levels of CO2 then? Yes. CO2 is required to make plants grow. Animals were bigger then due to this, and the vegetation was lush. Eventually, the earth cooled, and many species died, but that is the course of the circle of life. Did humans cause the Earth the dinosaurs inhabited to be so hot with so much CO2 by consuming fossil fuels? I really don&#39;t think so.<br /><br />The Earth will always be here. Species come and go as this occurs. Survival of the most adaptable. The earth goes through changes. Something I did find interesting in this video was the argument about the Sun not warming the uppermost layer of the atmosphere, and it being the lower layers getting warmer (where CO2 might accumulate). That is some intriguing information. Yet this video fails to address other planets in our solar system also getting hotter, and some scientists attribute that to the sun. Whether they&#39;re correct in that attribution is irrelevant -- sun activity is diminishing afterall -- but the fact remains that they are also getting hotter. Are humans burning fossil fuels on Earth causing that?<br /><br />There&#39;s as much evidence for climate science as against. Climategate was a big deal. People did lie, for financial incentives and with political motivations. To chide &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; and make fun of them early in the video, while funny, is a bit immature, not to mention an extreme display of sophistry. I understand YouTube videos need to be short, but the shortcut of telling us global warming evidence is overwhelming rather than proving it is lazy. Making a statement is not proving a statement. Then making fun of real people with real reasons for their real beliefs... that&#39;s low. Sophistry is not fact. It&#39;s just sophistry.<br /><br />In short, this video suffers from: causation != correlation; sophistry; straw man fallacy; and many other logical, rhetorical, and philosophical blunders. If you&#39;re going to attack people, risking isolating a portion of your fan base, at least wear your big boy panties.<br /><br />In the end, even if global warming supporters are 100% correct, we are not saving the planet. The planet will still be here, will adapt, change, and grow, whether we&#39;re here to witness it or not. This is all about saving humanity, selfish motivations out the wazoo. Carbon taxes... hmm... that seems like a great idea to reduce pollution. Money will certainly clean our air... wait, no it won&#39;t. Throwing money at a problem won&#39;t fix it. All the money in the world won&#39;t protect us from global warming (if it&#39;s true). At best, a carbon tax solution as proposed at present reduced the number of people consuming fossil fuels to only those who can afford it. That rate is adjustable, and thus the number of people at any given time consuming fuel is adjustable as well. This is not conspiracytardedness but rather an honest analysis of a proposed policy. But if only a small percent of the rich elite have access to fossil fuels... what happens to the rest of us in today&#39;s modern world, especially those of us in suburbs or rural communities?

Have a look at the list of your favorite weather service (e.g., NOAA). Second, the temperature measurement stations are firstly used for weather forecast. So if they would measure rubbish the weather predictions would be off. And third, even if all weather stations would be built beside power plants, the power plant would have an steady or oscillating behavior which would have an steady or oscillating impact on the measurements, but they would not increase over the long time.

Keep it in the freezer with the cap on and let it freeze COMPLETELY. When you take the bottle out you will see that the water level is less and that sometimes the bottle look like it has been compressed. This is because the same thing that happens to the water also happens to the air.

Different systems are suited to different situations. The U.S. system has worked out so far but no system is perfect, and it has felt the creep of other influences. IF climate change really is the greatest issue facing mankind, then Scientific Nazism might be the best approach to combat it. But I STRONGLY disagree with this statement: "...the level of complexity of the issues facing society could be understood by the majority of people. Not so anymore." Throughout history it seems that every generation thinks it is more enlightened than the one before it. And throughout history people keep trying systems that, historically, inevitably lead to failure. History sheds light on what works and what does not. It is arrogance to think that it will work THIS time.	UC-etbTrRdUhuLf9O7iGMQcw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-etbTrRdUhuLf9O7iGMQcw	1	UghS3A9zAeunGXgCoAEC	Yiannis Mihail

Populations have to be forced to use these somehow.	UCvw_JXSHzz3PLWkaGz6FmSQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvw_JXSHzz3PLWkaGz6FmSQ	0

So i'll say a little more. If something is so true that the government is thinking of making it a criminal offence to be skeptical or say things that oppose this "truth". There is something wrong and you should see that. When scientists look at the "facts" and they way the conclusions are drawn they are baffled and saddened that they didn't look sooner instead of just going along with the narrative. Also climate models are so terrible at predicting anything that they can't even use them to predict the past. So think what you want but you should keep an open mind and look into things a little more. Remember I was where you are once before. I'm always a little skeptical of the positions I hold it is good to be challenged in your beliefs that way you can see if they stand the test of scrutiny.

So thanks for the effort but if you are ever going to convince a denier that climate change is real and man-made and dangerous, it&#39;s going to be by decoupling their opinion on climate change from all other opinions and political views.<br /><br />The only thing that&#39;s ever going to help is to make people see that environmentalism is not a liberal idea but a conservative as well.

The truth is that facts are NEVER enough for any conclusion on any topic. Logic dictates that a valid conclusion can only be drawn when sound reasoning bridges the gap between facts and your conclusion. Presenting facts and jumping to a conclusion is a fallacy.<br /><br />I&#39;d like to see a video where you offer logical reasoning instead of plain facts. It would be easy for someone to present as many facts as you did and reach the opposite conclusion, which is why your video isn&#39;t convincing. Can you weigh the opposing sides for why oceans are rising? Can you offer an explanation of how it may be caused by humans, how it may be caused by not humans, and why the explanation for &quot;by humans&quot; is more reasonable than &quot;not humans&quot;?

Neither treated like an idiot, or have someone speak with such a thick dialect of science (that is a dialect, try reading their papers on university level, makes no sense to mere mortals). But... I need more data, to do anything about it though...<br /><br />It would be nice to know if I eat 300 grams of beef (if there is a significant difference between countries/regions of origin, then put all the data and make it easy to search), or used one kWh of power made from coal and other sources (so I can make a localised calculation), or used 1 litre of petrol in my car, how does that translate into warmer temperatures? And this has to include production released gasses as well (example: refining oil to petrol and the chemicals etc. there are used to get the oil out of the ground).<br /><br />I know this might be 10^-X kelvin (where X is maybe around 15-20?) crazy small stuff, but if I am ever going to change any pattern in my life until I have data to do cost benefit analysis with. No one ever just gives up everything bad, but most will make concessions based on informed non-forcefull options.<br /><br />Also there needs to be more information on indirect sources of green house gas emissions. A random example (that might not have anything to do with reality): If I buy beef from Brazil, what are the impacts of supporting Brazilian agriculture, on driving people to turn the rainforest into farmland, since the rainforest eats CO2...<br /><br />The only way to do anything about green house gasses is to inform consumers in a non-emotional way with data. If 2 products are equally good for the same job, but one hurts the environment more, then only an idiot would buy the product that does most harm, but the data and meta-data on this that I can find, is either useless or written in a dialect of science that no non-scientist would ever be able to read.<br /><br />Driving a car full of people can often be better for the environment than using public transportation. But 1-3 people driving is a lot worse than public transportation (depending on the car). Hybrids are often challenged to meat more challenging requirements, which means they are far from always the solution.<br /><br />We need to stop this good-and-bad-for-the-environment argument and tell people exactly how bad something is. Even if it take 10 years before it makes sense to them. Getting people to care is a long and slow process, and has to be done respectfully based on presenting useful and relevant data and not emotions (if you were emotionally invested in this, then you would already be convinced).<br /><br />The value of something in raised temperature is something we need to introduce or nothing will ever really change.

Salt Lake City gets the vast majority of it&#39;s electricity from dirty coal burning plants. So when you drive a 100% electric car around in a coal dependent place like Salt Lake City, you are driving coal powered car, putting dirty carbon in the air.

Climate change is a positive feedback loop, so once the cycle starts, it's impossible to stop just by not adding any more CO2 to the atmosphere. The only way to stop a positive feedback loop like this is to subtract CO2 from the air down to an equilibrium that doesn't increase or decrease global temerature.

There is a confusion about sea ice melt and glaciers melt affecting the levels of the sea. Since glaciers flow they can run off land and since they store a lot of packed frozen water they can heavily influence the sea level and salinity. Sea ice is already in the water and has no effect on the level or salinity. The quickest danger besides flooding is actually the effect on food acidic oceans and dry land can destroy entire food chains as well as agricultures.

In fact it is absolutely necessary for the greenhouse effect to work which allows for the Earth to maintain its temperature. The greenhouse effect is a natural phenomena where gasses trap in heat and without it we would most likely all be dead. However mass amounts of co2 is the issue. It causes for lots of heat to be trapped in the Earth's atmosphere which causes the rise of temperature. Now the rising sea levels can have a lot of impacts and not just minor flooding. It can contaminate drinking water by flowing into aquifers, threaten wildlife populations by flooding their habitats and even have a major toll on the economy. People will lose their homes and with that there will be an extreme economic cost. Coastal real estate market will be destroyed and people will have to migrate because they won't have anywhere to stay with their homes being flooded.

We like things to be predictable and steady, we like a routine. And the idea that we are changing things drastically is unpopular.<br /><br />But an even bigger problem is defeatism. &quot;I know that things are bad, but what can I do to stop it? I&#39;m just one person, and one person never makes a difference.&quot; Well that might be true, but it you don&#39;t at least try, you definitely WON&#39;T. We are the system and if we want to change the system, we need to change ourselves.<br /><br />Bizarrely, the third threat to fighting climate change is annoyance. Within the past twenty years, going green has been the trend. Nowadays if you&#39;re not eating organic, grass fed, free range beef, people make you feel like a villain. Like you and your Big Mac and Coke are directly responsible for the death of the polar bears. We get nagged at so much in the modern world to be green that it is sometimes having the opposite effect. Instead of saying, &quot;Oh crap, California is experiencing a drought of epic proportions that threatens the lives of millions!&quot; the badgered Big Mac eaters say, &quot;Screw California! If you don&#39;t like the weather there you can move somewhere else!&quot;<br /><br />I don&#39;t think that people are really saying that global warming isn&#39;t happening. I think their saying, &quot;Meh it&#39;s not my problem, I won&#39;t be around to see it.&quot; and that&#39;s wrong thinking because if we keep gong the way we are. You might be.

Also what he said that people will not disagree with the group. The same applies to scientists. I feel that there is not a real debate, climate change. Because when you want to discuss it seriously people say &quot;The boat has left, it is so!&quot; <br /><br />Like I have never got a actual good explanation on how CO2 traps heat in the atmosphere.  0.0397% of the atmosphere is CO2, a tiny amount. How can such tiny substance have such a great effect on the climate?<br /><br />Sun activity, I would like to see some non-disputable data that the sun-activity has gone down. Like, think, just seasons like summer on the north side of the earth and winter at the same time on the south side is due to earth&#39;s tilt. A tiny variable , the tilt of the earth, makes the seasons. Thus I think the sun must be a bigger culprit , than it is portrayed today. <br /><br />Also, there is a lot of tax money in CO2 taxes. And scientists wanting to study the sceptics view get denied funding. So there is a incentive for the government to encourage the belief in global warming to get more revenue. My point is that I think the sciences is biased. 500 years ago it was a know fact, that the earth was in the centre of the universe with the heliocentric world view. 97% of the scientists of the day supported that view! <br /><br />My biggest worry is the acidity of the oceans. But wouldn&#39;t algae counter that? <br /><br />But again, not taking the sceptics serious is the leading cause that you will have allot of sceptics because one just looks so biased when you ridicule like &quot;Its okay to be smart&quot; did. Which is ironic since it obviously is not okay to be a sceptic.. :P	UC8qtavfYD2IyrI7-YKiAigw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8qtavfYD2IyrI7-YKiAigw	0

In the last 30 years, 50% of its coral cover is gone. The reasons?: Rising sea temperatures, unnatural outbreaks of Crown Of Thorns Starfish (starfish that eat coral), rising Ph levels that lead to ocean acidification, which weaken the limestone that corals are made out of. Multiple species (scuh as the Mountain Pygmy Possum) being forced to adapt to rising atmospheric temperatures in the alpine regions of Australia.

The "global warming hiatus" doesn't exist.  Studies published in June of this year have found errors in the data published in the 5th IPCC report. The IPCC report showed that warming trends had slowed to a rate of 0.039°C per decade, leading to speculation about a "hiatus" or "levelling off" of temperature rise. In reality, data indicates that temperatures have been rising at a rate of 0.116°C per decade since 1998, which is three times faster than previously thought, and entirely in line with earlier projections. Studies reported by the IPCC in 2013 had suggested that global warming slowed or paused during the period of 1998 to 2012. More thorough research shows the global warming "hiatus" likely never happened, but instead was caused by a failure to account for cooler temperature readings collected by ocean buoys, whose presence in the oceans had increased during the same period. http://earthsky.org/earth/global-warming-hiatus-never-happened-study-says Are you going to adjust your view to accommodate new and updated data, or are you going to cling to the old and outmoded data because it supports your existing beliefs?  It's up to you.

The new one has been tested thousands maybe hundreds of thousands of times while the old one has only been tested a couple hundred times. Would it be smarter to choose the one that has been tested little or more? You must learn to give the benefit of the doubt to the new one because the testing has shown it was more reliable. so lets say the extensive tests show that the new one (in a large percentage of the tests) records temperatures that are higher or lower than the older thermometer. Then it is safe to assume that the old thermometer recorded data incorrectly and it would be dishonest to the community to not change the data in order to fit with the more accurate and tested thermometer. So you can think of it like this but just replace the thermometers with popular methods that were used to record atmospheric temperature and other data.

The data is gathered, analyzed, and averaged to yield the results and trends. When flaws are found in the manner in which the data was gathered, analyzed, or averaged, correcting those flaws produces new results, and the figures are corrected accordingly. The IPCC 5th assessment report used data gathered from thousands of sources all over the world to find that the rate of warming had apparently slowed down. Just this year, NOAA found flaws in the methodology by which that data was gathered and analyzed, and their corrected values showed that indeed it had not slowed down.

Previous measurements of Pluto taken from multiple vectors of analysis concluded the planet to be 2301 km in diameter. When a superior vector of analysis was achieved with the New Horizons probe, the value was corrected to 2326 km. That's how science works: findings are continuously updated and corrected as methodologies increase in sophistication.

The process is quite a bit more sophisticated than that. To understand what the climate is doing, it is necessary to measure air temperatures at different altitudes (including the high atmosphere using satellite sensors), at the ocean surface, ocean depths, ground temperatures, subterranean temperatures, and so on and so forth. This enormous body of data has to be gathered, assembled and meticulously analyzed to derive averages and trends. It has been an international effort involving thousands and thousands of individual scientists. Are you saying that thousands and thousands of scientists have thrown away their integrity to participate in a nefarious conspiracy? Why would they do this? To pay their mortgages? Or is it more likely that five or six of the world's largest and most powerful fossil fuel companies have commissioned a handful of cranks to confuse the public and stall legislative action in order to preserve their multi-trillion dollar oil businesses? After all, we've seen that before: a five or six of the world's largest and most powerful tobacco companies commissioned a handful of cranks to confuse the public and stall legislative action in order to preserve their multi-billion dollar tobacco businesses. Indeed, some of the same people involved in yesterday's tobacco disinformation campaign are involved in today's climate disinformation campaign: http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/legacy/assets/documents/global_warming/exxon_report.pdf (Page 40, Table 3). If it is your contention that the planet is not warming at all, and that all the data showing otherwise is fabricated, you have a lot of catching up to do. Even the most obstinate climate deniers have now accepted that the planet is in fact warming. They have accepted it because it has become impossible to ignore, and because it makes them look like idiots when they deny something that is obvious to everyone.

You see, scientists are always trying to prove themselves and each other wrong, and to find flaws in their own work. Entire careers are made out of that, and indeed it's what drives all scientific inquiry. It's through establishing what's not true that what is true is ascertained and refined. Our ability to accurately assess data and render projections today is contingent upon the reliability of data gathered yesterday. Constant scrutiny is applied to decades-old data because this is how we increase the sophistication of our methods and our insights today. Indeed, apart from this scrutiny and refinement there would be more bias in today's observations, not less. Which is more likely: that tens of thousands of career-dedicated scientists over the past century have been wrangled into a monolithic intergenerational conspiracy to dupe the world into accepting a global carbon dictatorship, or that a handful of extremely wealthy corporations have invested a tiny portion of their assets into a disinformation campaign with the aim of protecting their already-existing market dominance?

Antarctic ice is in a state of unprecedented decline. You can look this up yourself in numerous peer-reviewed scientific journals. There have been numerous investigations conducted by numerous committees trying to find evidence of malfeasance in the scientific community, and no such evidence is forthcoming. If you check carefully, you'll find that the only people claiming the contrary are on the payroll of the oil & gas industry. Gesturing toward climate change on other planets is simply an absurd fallacy. It is not more than this. The earth's atmosphere is not collapsing because of the sun. I'm not even sure what that means. What I can tell you is that total solar irradiance has been declining, while global temperatures have been increasing. You can look this up yourself in numerous peer-reviewed scientific journals.

Ice volume is on the decline, though. What's happening in the Arctic is significant. Sea ice extent this year is considerably lower than 2012, the previous record low year. I can't say for sure, but I wouldn't be surprised if this summer is the first ice-free summer in the North Pole.

The proof of man made warming comes from comparisons between current and ancient atmospheric compositions and from an analysis of the type of radiation causing the increased heat. We know that CO2 is increasing because we have samples of the atmosphere through time trapped in ice.  We know that the increase is due to human activity because the additional CO2 is of the isotope created from the burning of fossil fuels.  We know that the CO2 human beings put in the atmosphere is responsible for warming because the radiation that we can measure on the surface as being responsible for warming has the same frequency as that bounced back by the particular isotope of CO2 we put in the atmosphere.

As for the antarctic ice at a high (It's not at a record breaking level this year, I'm pretty sure it was last year though) Google it, don't take my word for it. Also, you are right that fabricated data doesn't change other research, but those climate models are used by governments to decide what action to take.. So it causes more distrust in governments.

Increasing southern sea ice is due to a combination of complex phenomena including cyclonic winds around Antarctica and changes in ocean circulation. <br />Antarctic sea ice coverage expanded to 7.63 million square miles, exceeding record high levels set in September 2013.

It is due to complex short term whether phenomenon which will go away at some point and then we'll see the sea ice levels drop. All this is beside one very important point though: while the sea ice is growing (which is no longer true, it has decreased since this time last year http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/) the land ice (aka. ice sheet) is the important statistic. And that is what is actually decreasing (primarily in West antarctica but also incredibly rapidly in Greenland). The antarctic ice sheet is primarily going down although east antarctica is mildly bucking the trend for some reason, not nearly enough to compensate for losses. [sources] http://nsidc.org/cryosphere/quickfacts/icesheets.html http://www.skepticalscience.com/antarctica-gaining-ice.htm And another interesting note, the reasons currently given for the increase in sea ice are as follows: i.) wind patterns from an anomalous strong low-pressure pattern ii.) warmer waters melting deeper ocean ice, inhibiting mixing of different density water and fueling sea-ice growth conditions.

Bill Nye does not have a clue about the reality of science. He talks about the last ice age ending "tens of thousands" of years ago, but we are still in it. The glacial period ended 12 thousand years ago, not 20 thousand plus. I have no clue where he got the idea that the interglacial period should have ended because he has never shown any evidence of that claim. Interglacial periods usually last between 15 and 18 thousand years, so this one should end in about 5000 years.

We are in an interglacial period and that will not end for 5000 year or so. What caused the ice age was Antarctica moving over the south pole AND the Indian and Eurasian plates crashing together to create the Himalayans, disrupting air patterns, and increasing the albedo of the planet. What causes the interglacial period is the changes in the earth orbit, processing, and the position of the earth in the orbit during the season. There is no evidence that the atmosphere is sensitive to a change in co2 levels. That is because co2 is not the trigger that some people claim it is. Look at the second graph of this page.https://www.geocraft.com/WVFossils/Carboniferous_climate.html You will see that there is no link between co2 levels and co2. The alarmist spend hundreds of billions to spread fake information because of two reasons. First they are trying to destroy capitalism so that they can create a one world government. Secondly, some of them are using it to get rich. Its all about power and money. Animals have been able to handle much greater rates of change than has happen in the last century. In the late 1500 to early 1600, the temperature dropped by over 3°c in little more than a century. IF they can handle a drop that drastically, they can easily handle a rise of 1°c per century. Science should not be political, but man made climate change is. Hurricanes are on the decrease.

Some people believe that solar activity is the driving force of the Earth's climate. That's only part of the equation. There are also greenhouse gases that have an effect on our climate. Humans release excessive co2 into the atmosphere and at this point in history it's anthropogenic greenhouse gases driving climate for the first time in history. There are people who refuse to believe in the greenhouse factor, or that humans contribute at all, which is great for the oil companies who sell us our fossil fuels at exorbitant prices. That's why they spend a billion dollars a year to spread disinfo. Politicizing climate is an issue. Science isn't political. The rate at which carbon dioxide is increasing is changing the climate so drastically that weather patterns have become unstable. Unfortunately not only do animals depend on stable weather patterns for their survival, to locate water, hunt, fish, find land, etc. We rely on stable weather patterns for farming, but also to know where we can live without hurricanes ripping up our habitats every few years. It costs our country billions to rebuild.	UC7i06JhOLBT6vSo4TE4__8A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7i06JhOLBT6vSo4TE4__8A	1	UgxzBILQ1xfKCGt9VyN4AaABAg	ixtasis

Not a basis for agglomerated consent. Many scientists who do not agree with catastrophic AGW are listed in with those who do agree. Their objections are ignored, even if they publicly reject the results of studies that claim to prove the consensus.<br />Actual study results<br />Naomi Oreskes 2004<br />Study was published 4 days before the Kyoto Conference, before it was peer reviewed. It is always cited as a peer reviewed paper.<br />there was Global Cooling noted by 2006<br />Al Gore claimed broadly, citing the Orensky study, that zero scientists disagreed w the AGW<br /><br />B.

They only make up 5 percent of the IPPC scientist staff. 97 percent of those who publish are with the ADGCC.<br /><br />One of the most cited studies: John Cook<br />Australian Climate Communications Officer<br />Definition Question/Statement : Humans Cause Warming 12 or 13,000 articles, many were not representative of the discipline of the whole, and included opinion pieces. They only read the abstracts.<br />67 percent had no position<br />.5 percent endorsed AGW<br />Many authors who are included in the study publicly objected to how their work was characterized. One article was only about media coverage of Climate Change.When several scientists demanded to review the data, Cook dissimulated. <br />A hacker got to the data. He then waffled on time-stamps. When the time-stamps were found you could see that they processed an unrealistic number of articles in too little time to be able to actually evaluate them. Investigators discovered that Cook classified articles that are in disagreement as supportive of the Catastrophic AGW hypothesis.<br />He later admitted that the data was not processed well.<br /><br />Actual Percentages of endorsements for Catastrophic AGW:<br />Orensky 1.2 percent<br />Doran and Zimmermann 2.38 percent<br />Anderegg 66 percent<br />Cook and al 0.54 percent	UCcbUr9ZoiufVV6am8uEFA0Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcbUr9ZoiufVV6am8uEFA0Q	0

The polls were done badly. There are several parts to the question, parts of which are and parts of which are not controversial. Climate Change is an obvious thing and no scientist disputes that. The greenhouse effect is already disputed by some scientists. The human contribution to co2 is undisputed, but co2's forcing effect is disputed widely. Very few scientists think that humans are driving climate, although all think there might be some contribution. I follow scientific conferences in four languages, so I see a fair amount of data gathering results and hear quite a range of opinions. The climate alarmist camp is funded to the teeth, so I think it's difficult to find a party without a conflict of interest at this point.

Less than one minute into a supposedly scientific explanation of why I should accept what climate scientists say, I&#39;m hit with a straw man that basically ridicules all skepticism as irrational conspiracy theory. The companion piece to this &quot;Why people don&#39;t believe in Climate Change&quot; Was equally condescending and snarky basically saying that my brain is stuck in cave-man mode. Apparently you guys have no idea why otherwise rational people don&#39;t trust the conclusions of climate science. There are actual rational reasons. It would have been nice if those reasons could have been addressed. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffjIyms1BX4&amp;t=3m26s">3:26</a> There&#39;s one reason why I&#39;m skeptical. Simulations. So much of this rides on the trustworthiness of simulations written by people who went into the climate field, very likely BECAUSE they believed the climate was changing and that man was responsible. How do I know that this bias is not being programmed into the simulation. &quot;Opps! Looks like the simulation is not working right, we are not getting the &quot;right&quot; answer, tweak those numbers a bit.&quot;<br /><br />In the 80&#39;s they told us (in elementary school, through a program called CARE), that by 2001 we&#39;d all have to wear protective suits to be able to go outside. Also we were supposed to have used up all the oil by 2001 (or maybe it was 2010). They told us a lot of stuff that wasn&#39;t true. So forgive me for not trusting these people, they have a bad track record that they have NEVER addressed. Why were they wrong in the 80&#39;s, and why are they right now? The kids who were brainwashed in the 80&#39;s are they heading up these climate science research projects?<br /><br />I don&#39;t trust climate scientists because they are living in an echo chamber where the only acceptable answer to any question is the popular one. That isn&#39;t science. Science is about skepticism, when skepticism dies, so does scientific inquiry. I&#39;m not denying anything, I&#39;m still skeptical, that&#39;s all.

Instead, you use foolish pseudoskepticism to ignore those sources. Then you rely on crackpot blogs for your information on science. This is as a ridiculous as ignoring peer-reviewed scientific research showing that Earth is round, ignoring the consensus of Earth scientists saying that Earth is round, and instead relying on a flat-earther blog for your information. "Unlike mainstream climate scientists, who publish primarily in peer reviewed journals, these critics typically employ a range of non-peer-reviewed outlets, ranging from *blogs* to the books we are examining. A large majority—97 of the 108 books—are self-published (33), published by a CTT [conservative think tanks] press (35), published by a conservative (or conservative religious) press (17), or published by a popular press (12), and are thus unlikely to have undergone peer review—particularly by individuals with expertise in climate science. Notably, not a single denial book is published by a university press.[...] *The general lack of peer review allows authors or editors of denial books to make inaccurate assertions that misrepresent the current state of climate science. Like the vast range of other non-peer-reviewed material produced by the denial community, book authors can make whatever claims they wish, no matter how scientifically unfounded."* http://abs.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/05/01/0002764213477096.full.pdf	UCWZGVxHPDNenYs5mkxjUwhA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWZGVxHPDNenYs5mkxjUwhA	1	Ugj2fJ7V99Tj6HgCoAEC	Paul Stringini

For example, take the following for AIDS denialists: "Deniers argue that because scientists receive grant money, fame, and prestige as a result of their research, it is in their best interest to maintain the status quo [15]. This type of thinking is convenient for deniers as it allows them to choose which authorities to believe and which ones to dismiss as part of a grand conspiracy. In addition to being selective, their logic is also internally inconsistent." http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0040256 Now, we can see the same sort of conspiract theories from AGW denialists: "Climate Change Skepticism and Denial: An Introduction [...] A constant refrain coming from the denial campaign is that climate scientists are *“alarmists”* who exaggerate the degree and threat of global warming to enhance their status, funding, and influence with policy makers. The contribution by William Freudenburg and Violetta Muselli provides an insightful empirical test of this charge and finds it to lack support." Your claims about "alarmists" fit into this pattern of inventing conspiracy theories. *"I think I made it clear from the beginning how much I know about climate science. I'm merely an everyday fellow looking in on a subject I'm only marginally interested and running into you, is this what climate fundamentalism looks like? Insulting or attempting to shame me into submission will not work."* Then *ask questions, as opposed to making up baseless claims about scientists working in a field in which you're ignorant.* I cannot EMPHASIZE that enough. That's what sensible people do. For example, I don't know much about macroeconomics and I'm only marginally interested it. However, I wouldn't invent some baseless, silly conspiracy theory about how: "economists are building their bias into their models/simulations, so the economists can claim humans are responsible for bad things!!!" I would instead ask questions about the subject so that I could learn. Or I'd read reputable sources on macroeconomics, such as peer-reviewed papers in the subject or textbooks. Or I would defer to the experts in this subject. *"Bias, fear-mongering, and a tendency to authoritarianism. Those are my concerns,"* Baseless concerns for which you have no evidence. *"You are simply denying that Climate SCIENTISTS are alarmist."* I'm not just denying; I cited *evidence* against it. You just refuse to engage that evidence, which is typical for denialists. *" I'm saying that they believe in climate change and that they exaggerate the threat in order to make us do something about it,"* And your wrong when you claim this (as I repeatedly explained to you) that source that scientists tend to *under-estimate* the effects of climate change, as opposed to exaggerating them in the way you claim. You still keep dodging this point. *"I'll keep that in mind if I ever become sincerely interested in the subject."* I already knew you weren't sincerely interested in any evidence that shows you're wrong. I expect that of denialists: "It is, however, important not to confuse denialism with genuine scepticism, which is essential for scientific progress. Sceptics are willing to change their minds when confronted with new evidence; deniers are not." http://www.bmj.com/content/341/bmj.c6950.full *"You sound like a climate fundamentalist, as though any sort of questioning of the anointed group is forbidden. I question authorities. That is how I operate."* You're not just questioning. You're making ridiculous, baseless accusations. Basically, you're *JAQing off* and using "implication by question": "Just asking questions (JAQ-ing off) is a way of attempting to make wild accusations acceptable (and hopefully not legally actionable) by framing them as questions rather than statements." http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Just_asking_questions "One form of misleading discourse involves presupposing and implying something without stating it explicitly, by phrasing it as a question." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_question *"What about Human population? How will climate change effect human population? Where is the evidence for that?"* Already explained that to you and cited evidence on it to you. It's sad that you keep pretending otherwise. Once again: There's abundant scientific research showing that anthropogenic climate change has caused (or will cause): - increased heat-related mortality (which outweighs any decreases in cold-related mortality) - increased drought intensity - economic losses from sea level rise - increased hurricane intensity - ocean acidification (which results in things such as loss of marine crops and marine food) - reduced crop yields and so on. *"Humanity is the whole human race. (By definition).And not merely a part."* *"No, threats to humanity apply to all humans, not to various groups of humans."* *"So a threat to the whole human race does not, I repeat does not, include things which merely increase human mortality like "obesity" or any of the things you listed."* You're abusing language. For example, one can be prosecuted for "crimes against humanity", even if one doesn't commit a crime against all humans: http://www.internationalcrimesdatabase.org/Crimes/CrimesAgainstHumanity Furthermore, public health issues and anthropogenic climate change are categorized as threats to humanity, even if they don't kill everyone. See, for example: "Zika virus: a global threat to humanity: a comprehensive review and current developments" "The counterfeit anti-malarial is a crime against humanity: a systematic review of the scientific evidence" "New vision, new paradigm: health and wealth for all by 2100 — or for no one" "Infectious diseases are a major threat to humanity, and accurate surveillance is essential." https://hal-amu.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01199455/document Yet here you are, acting that something must be a threat to *the entire human race* in order to be a threat to humanity. Amazing. *"Unscrupulous is the wrong adjective in that sentence."* I meant "unscrupulous"; i.e. I'm accusing you of dishonesty. *"You deny the alarmist point of view exists among scientists, but I, the uninformed moron, have happened to hear the alarmist claim repeated over and over. I see it in movies and on YouTube."* Oh my goodness, you seriously think you know what scientists think, because you watch movies and Youtube videos?! *"Stopping global warming will not end heat related deaths."* Goal-post move by you. The issue was not ending all heat-related deaths. Instead the issue was that: There's abundant scientific research showing that anthropogenic climate change has caused (or will cause) increased heat-related mortality (which outweighs any decreases in cold-related mortality), even with adaptation strategies such as air conditioning. Try addressing that point.	UCWZGVxHPDNenYs5mkxjUwhA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWZGVxHPDNenYs5mkxjUwhA	1	Ugj2fJ7V99Tj6HgCoAEC	Paul Stringini

As I told you, there's abundant scientific research showing that anthropogenic climate change has caused (or will cause) increased heat-related mortality (which outweighs any decreases in cold-related mortality) increased drought intensity...and so on.* I saw that. Those sound like serious problems. Those are not threats to humanity. What about Human population? How will climate change effect human population? Where is the evidence for that? That is the claim I am interested in. The threat to humanity. *Anything that kills humans (i.e. increases human mortality) is a threat to humanity, by definition.* Uh, no. That was a transparent rhetorical device using "by definition" incorrectly, you can't get that past me. I am calling Capital T and capital B. Total Bullshit. Humanity is the whole human race. (By definition).And not merely a part. This is an error of logic on your part. So a threat to the whole human race does not, I repeat does not, include things which merely increase human mortality like "obesity" or any of the things you listed. Linguistically, you are living in George Orwell's 1984. These are the things which are commonly classified as potential threats to humanity. Artificial intelligence. Synthetic biology. Extreme climate change. (I did not add the "extreme") Nanotechnology. Nuclear war. Major asteroid impact. Global pandemic. Notice, things at the level of obesity and severe drought don't make the list. They are not threatening humanity as a whole and have little potential to threaten humanity as a whole. And humanity is the whole of humans. *Humanity is a collection of humans, and killing humans is a obviously a threat to humans.* Incorrect. Humanity is ALL HUMANS. Not a collection. A threat to humans is not a threat to humanity. On this level I am probably more of an expert even than you. You are not going to bully me on language. You are totally wrong here. *Of course, we often put up with threats to humanity, for various humans.* No, threats to humanity apply to all humans, not to various groups of humans. By definition. And I mean that. This is a major blunder. Category error. *For example, we put up with smoking because we want people to have the legal freedom to smoke. We put up with peanuts (which kill people via peanut allergies) so other non-allergic people can enjoy them. And so on.* You should stick to the environment. When it comes to changing the meaning of words to suit your purpose, I will catch you. This is what happens when you degrade your opposition, you begin to believe I am actually as ignorant generally as you suggest I am on the environment specifically and justifiably. *It takes a truly unscrupulous person to pretend that increase mortality isn't a threat to humans.:* That, is what they call moving the goal posts. You went from a threat to humanity to a threat to humans. A knife is a threat to humans, not to humanity. If there were no hippopotamuses, it would save a few hundred lives a year. So does that make hippos a threat to humanity? Did you not consider that the current climate is actually a threat to humans? What if the climate changed for the better? (This is purely hypothetical) What if the climate changed in some hypothetical way so that humans lived longer? In that case, the current climate is a threat to humanity. *It takes a truly unscrupulous person to pretend that increase mortality isn't a threat to humans.:* Unscrupulous is the wrong adjective in that sentence. You mean stupid. Really no other word makes sense. It takes a truly stupid person to pretend that increased mortality isn't a threat to humans since increased human mortality clearly kills humans. *Anyway, not everyone has access to adequate home cooling; otherwise, no one would ever die from environmentally-induced heat stroke.* I understand your moral point about scruples, even though your point about threats to humanity was inaccurate. I care about people too. And I care about the environment. When I say "keep your baby cool" what I'm saying is that people might choose to live with those risks, just like they choose to live with smoking. But I believe that climate change is being advertised as a threat to human existence which, if not dealt with, will amount to human suicide. We already have people dying of heat stroke (and have had) for all of human history. It is s serious problem, but people deal with it. Stopping global warming will not end heat related deaths. There is (as I suggested) a more ideal climate for humans than the current one. Death by exposure is a constant threat to human life. (Still not the same as a threat to humanity). Always has been. *And if you'd bother to read some of the research in question, then you'd know that the increased heat-related mortality occurs even with adaptation strategies (like home cooling). For instance:* I think what you mean is that the cost of maintaining a livable environment would make certain areas uninhabitable for all practical purposes. We have put men on the moon. *This is one of the main problems with you, Paul: you just make stuff up (usually, whatever you think will help your position) without reading up on the evidence to see if your claims are supported.* My main problem with you is that you don't see what I am. I don't really have a position. I kind of believe in climate change, but I kind of mistrust climate alarmist claims of Armageddon, I think they get that idea from models, so I wonder if the models could be wrong. You deny the alarmist point of view exists among scientists, but I, the uninformed moron, have happened to hear the alarmist claim repeated over and over. I see it in movies and on YouTube. It seems like you want to demean and shame me into studying the field of climate change. I don't respond to shame due to the way I was raised. Personally I think climate science has enough apologists. I wanted to watch a video where my admittedly uninformed opinions would be informed. This video wasn't it. I commented and went back to my normal activities, which include total disinterest in climate change. If I was full before, I'm bursting now. I'm not going to read a research paper. *"Glad to hear you concede that I'm right about the science not providing evidence that humanity is "threatened"." I said no such thing.* Yes, I see, you define threats to humanity as threats to humans. A category error. Logic, don't leave home without it. *"But you are wrong about the sociology, climate scientists are promoting climate alarmism by claiming global warming is a "threat to humanity."" I dealt with this distortion of your's the first time you offered it. Please stop repeating your debunked point. Once again:* There's the rub, you don't want to address what I'm seeing, you are denying that a threat to humanity means a threat to humanity. *The scientists at the IPCC are fairly accurate in their model-based predictions. And when they get things wrong, they tend to under-estimate the effects of global warming, as opposed to exaggerating them, contrary to the claims made by denialists about scientists being "alarmists". See the following source on this:* Ok, but you are saying that a threat to humanity does not mean a threat to humanity, but a threat to humans. So how can I trust what you are saying since the meaning of your words is unclear? *"Climate Change Skepticism and Denial: An Introduction [...] A constant refrain coming from the denial campaign is that climate scientists are "alarmists" who exaggerate the degree and threat of global warming to enhance their status, funding, and influence with policy makers."* TThat is not really what I'm saying. I'm saying that they believe in climate change and that they exaggerate the threat in order to make us do something about it, because most people would rather deal with the consequences of global warming than do anything about it. I don't think they do it for money. I think they do it because they think they know what is best for the world. *And this is some of the relevant supporting research on this point: "Reexamining Climate Change Debates: Scientific Disagreement or Scientific Certainty Argumentation Methods (SCAMs)?" "Global warming estimates, media expectations, and the asymmetry of scientific challenge" "Climate change prediction: Erring on the side of least drama?"* I'll keep that in mind if I ever become sincerely interested in the subject. My claim *Right there, you moved the goal posts from threat to problem.* Your response *Not a goal-post move, since I mentioned "serious problem" *before" I mentioned "threat to humanity", and I made it clear that this was an "and/or" claim. Here the first instance in which I mentioned them:* Evidenced by A4 *Climate change is a serious problem and/or a danger to humanity* Ok, but from my perspective you've been moving the goal posts the whole time if the point was to address my comment on this video. I question the idea that climate models predict human extinction. Uninformed as I am, I assumed this position came from the models and scientists behind them. I have seen video (either fictional or non) of climate models showing an apocalyptic end to climate change. Whether these were real, Hollywood, or outdated Discovery channel, I cannot remember, but they left me with the impression that models were predicting human extinction.

You are getting entangled in gathering rhetorical victories without actually addressing the point I'm actually trying to make. *You're basically just making up baseless conspiracy theories about climate scientists,* One, it is not a conspiracy, it is fear-mongering and it is absolutely being done. I believe it is being done out of a sincere belief on the part of climate scientists that global warming is happening, but in order to provoke people to change, climate scientists are giving their silent approval to climate alarmists by not doing a very good job reproving them. You might complain a bit about my changing position. That's because I'm learning and I don't have an entrenched position. I'm one of those middle Americans whose friends all believe global warming is a hoax, but I think there may be something going on. So shoot me. I showed you that Puttnam video. In the comments, I dare you to say he is being alarmist when he claims that within a century global warming would cause human extinction. You will get your head bit off! Two, my questioning of BIAS in testing and interpreting data is NOT a conspiracy theory, it is a well-known sociological phenomenon which researchers do well to be wary of. It is a valid concern, especially when some of the scientists in question may believe that if no action is taken we may irreparably damage the Earth. If you are trying to prevent a disaster, you might be tempted to turn a blind eye on a little alarm. Three, the assertion that climate alarm does not exist is manifestly not true. Do I really have to fill this comment with references to people claiming that the coming climate change is an existential threat to the human species? *while making incorrect statements that reveal a lack of understanding of the relevant scientific evidence and how scientific reasoning works.* "As an uninformed skeptic" I think I made it clear from the beginning how much I know about climate science. I'm merely an everyday fellow looking in on a subject I'm only marginally interested and running into you, is this what climate fundamentalism looks like? Insulting or attempting to shame me into submission will not work. If you really care about the environment, you should study human nature. *And I'm not cherry-picking at all. I'm dealing with specific things you said, and showing how they are wrong.* No, you are cherry picking. The cherries are the specific things I said which you feel are most useful in your line of argumentation (that I am a climate denier). The issues which are at the core of my questioning of climate science you dismiss without consideration. Bias, fear-mongering, and a tendency to authoritarianism. Those are my concerns, but you treat them as if they are merely tools I use to undermine Climate Science. I may be doing that on some level, but that does not mean that my opinions are not sincerely held. For example, you did not address the video I linked, which is clearly alarmist. *The likely problem here is that you're not used to the sort of debating I do, which is the sort of debate done in philosophy and science: I address specific points someone makes, and provide evidence/arguments against those points.* This comment literally makes me groan and figuratively makes me want to puke. I've been engaging in philosophical debate for over twenty years. I am very familiar with the kind of debate you are engaging in (for better or worse). And I am very used to people who do not understand the other side of a question consistently pushing the debate towards ground they are comfortable with. I'm doing the same thing this time but I will respond to every point, that is my usual custom, but this is not my field of interest, so I was not following my custom. It's not some grand thing. This debate is essentially over my comment. Your assertion is that I'm a climate denier. It is the most pointless kind of debate, because I have already demonstrated that I am not a climate denier. Just because I am not an expert on climate science does not mean that I can't be sincerely skeptical and question claims that global warming is an existential threat to the human species. Claims you say are not being made, ok, but, in fact, I have heard those claims being made. They are implicit in the video my comment is attached to. *This is not what many non-experts like you do.* Full of yourself much? I had no idea my comment on this video would attract the notice of someone so astute and important as yourself! I fan my self in nervous apprehension! And I am an expert. Just not in climate science. *Instead, you guys just tend to make stuff up (without any evidence), and rely on the other person not to call you on this. Sorry, but that's not how I operate.* Hey, before I throw up after having attempted to swallow your virtue signaling, I'd like to remind you that this is not my area of expertise. I never claimed expertise in this area, and judging me as if I had claimed so is transparently unfair and demeaning. As far as the "no evidence" claim, that is not completely true. Suspicions do not require evidence. Motive is different from direct evidence but no less worth of consideration. And as far as my claim that there is a lot of climate alarm going on out there, I have plenty of evidence for that, I provided one source and really this is a point which does not need to be proven, because it is self-evident. You are simply denying that Climate SCIENTISTS are alarmist. When I hear an alarmist, I assume he is basing his alarm on something a scientist said. That may be incorrect. But since you have confirmed that scientists say global warming could be a "threat to humanity" I think it is a fair assumption. My claim *For one, I do not say that global is not happening. I do not say that global warming is not caused by human activity. In fact, I said that the idea made sense to me on a gut level.* Your assessment *Yet in your first post, you said* what I said. *That sounds like someone being "skeptical" (really being a denialist) about whether "climate was changing and that man was responsible". And this person was misrepresenting scientists and their simulations/models, in order to justify being "skeptical".* What it sounds like to you becomes a moot point once I clarify my mind to you, since this is a question of what I think, and on this score, I am the authority.. I questioned their motives, I questioned their bias, I did not say that I myself was convinced that there is no global warming or that could not be a human caused problem. You keep trying to cast me as a "denier" but I am clearly a "questioner." Why is it that you cannot understand that distinction? Even religious people question their faith, and questioning my belief in climate change is like that, because I don't believe it based on science, I'm ignorant of the science, I believe it based on other factors. I do tend to trust science, but not completely. You sound like a climate fundamentalist, as though any sort of questioning of the anointed group is forbidden. I question authorities. That is how I operate. You already told me what you think of that.	UCXu3sQgVxR31DUebSwh5OAg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXu3sQgVxR31DUebSwh5OAg	1	Ugj2fJ7V99Tj6HgCoAEC	Paul Stringini

You're basically just making up baseless conspiracy theories about climate scientists, while making incorrect statements that reveal a lack of understanding of the relevant scientific evidence and how scientific reasoning works. And I'm not cherry-picking at all.

You're now doing the same thing, so I suggest you stop complaining about it (lest you engage in hypocrisy). The likely problem here is that you're not used to the sort of debating I do, which is the sort of debate done in philosophy and science: I address specific points someone makes, and provide evidence/arguments against those points. This is not what many non-experts like you do. Instead, you guys just tend to make stuff up (without any evidence), and rely on the other person not to call you on this.

In fact, I said that the idea made sense to me on a gut level."* Yet in your first post, you said that: "There's one reason why I'm skeptical. Simulations. So much of this rides on the trustworthiness of simulations written by people who went into the climate field, very likely BECAUSE they believed the climate was changing and that man was responsible. How do I know that this bias is not being programmed into the simulation. "Opps! Looks like the simulation is not working right, we are not getting the "right" answer, tweak those numbers a bit."" That sounds like someone being "skeptical" (really being a denialist) about whether "climate was changing and that man was responsible". And this person was misrepresenting scientists and their simulations/models, in order to justify being "skeptical". *"You claimed, "Stop moving the goal-posts. You claimed that the models made no accurate empirical predictions." I never claimed that."* Yes you did. You said: "None of the predictions of these models are empirical." "And the degree and nature of the change caused by rising CO2 levels is a question for which we do not have empirical answers." You said this *before I ever mentioned climate change being a serious problem and/or a threat to humanity.* So please don't pretend your claim was an objection to that. Instead, you were objecting to my claim that: "Because the models/simulations are compared to data to make sure they are accurate." When I then showed you evidence of the confirmed empirical predictions of these models, you moved the goalposts to demanding that the models show that climate change was a danger to humanity. *"Serious problem and a threat to humanity are not equivalent. So when climate scientists say "threat to humanity" where do they get the evidence for that?"* I already cited evidence on that to you. Please stop acting otherwise. As I told you, there's abundant scientific research showing that anthropogenic climate change has caused (or will cause): - increased heat-related mortality (which outweighs any decreases in cold-related mortality) - increased drought intensity - economic losses from sea level rise - increased hurricane intensity - ocean acidification (which results in things such as loss of marine crops and marine food) - reduced crop yields and so on. *"None of those things are "threats to humanity""* Anything that kills humans (i.e. increases human mortality) is a threat to humanity, by definition. Humanity is a collection of humans, and killing humans is a obviously a threat to humans. Of course, we often put up with threats to humanity, for various humans. For example, we put up with smoking because we want people to have the legal freedom to smoke. We put up with peanuts (which kill people via peanut allergies) so other non-allergic people can enjoy them. And so on. *"I'm sorry, but increased heat related deaths of the very old and very young is a serious problem, but it is not a "threat to humanity." Keep your baby and grandparents cool."* It takes a truly unscrupulous person to pretend that increase mortality isn't a threat to humans. Anyway, not everyone has access to adequate home cooling; otherwise, no one would ever die from environmentally-induced heat stroke. And if you'd bother to read some of the research in question, then you'd know that the increased heat-related mortality occurs even with adaptation strategies (like home cooling). For instance: "Heat-Related Mortality and Adaptation to Heat in the United States" This is one of the main problems with you, Paul: you just make stuff up (usually, whatever you think will help your position) without reading up on the evidence to see if your claims are supported. *"Glad to hear you concede that I'm right about the science not providing evidence that humanity is "threatened"."* I said no such thing. *"But you are wrong about the sociology, climate scientists are promoting climate alarmism by claiming global warming is a "threat to humanity.""* I dealt with this distortion of your's the first time you offered it. Please stop repeating your debunked point. Once again: The scientists at the IPCC are fairly accurate in their model-based predictions. And when they get things wrong, they tend to *under-estimate* the effects of global warming, as opposed to exaggerating them, contrary to the claims made by denialists about scientists being "alarmists". See the following source on this: "Climate Change Skepticism and Denial: An Introduction [...] A constant refrain coming from the denial campaign is that climate scientists are *“alarmists”* who exaggerate the degree and threat of global warming to enhance their status, funding, and influence with policy makers. The contribution by William Freudenburg and Violetta Muselli provides an insightful empirical test of this charge and finds it to lack support." And this is some of the relevant supporting research on this point: "Reexamining Climate Change Debates: Scientific Disagreement or Scientific Certainty Argumentation Methods (SCAMs)?" "Global warming estimates, media expectations, and the asymmetry of scientific challenge" "Climate change prediction: Erring on the side of least drama?" *"Right there, you moved the goal posts from threat to problem."* Not a goal-post move, since I mentioned "serious problem" *before" I mentioned "threat to humanity", and I made it clear that this was an "and/or" claim. Here the first instance in which I mentioned them: "A4) Climate change is a serious problem *and/or* a danger to humanity."

For instance, diabetes, automobile accidents, allergic reactions to peanuts, etc. are serious problems that don't end the world, lead to humanity-ending catastrophe, etc. Similarly, anthropogenic climate change can be a serious problem with serious negative consequences, without collapsing human society, ending the world, etc. *"The globe has undergone many changes while humans have inhabited it. These Climate scientists are obviously no anthropologists."* You're making a very silly argument here. Past non-anthropogenic climate change doesn't change the fact that most of the recent global warming was caused by humans through the production of anthropogenic greenhouse gases. To say otherwise is as ridiculous as saying that humans can't cause forest fires now, since humans didn't cause a forest fire that occurred hundreds of years ago: "These examples illustrate that different climate changes in the past had different causes. The fact that natural factors caused climate changes in the past does not mean that the current climate change is natural. By analogy, the fact that forest fires have long been caused naturally by lightning strikes does not mean that fires cannot also be caused by a careless camper." https://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/faq-6-1.html "Critics have argued that, if temperatures were as warm or warmer than current conditions before the onset of anthropogenic forcing, this would provide evidence that “natural” fluctuations alone could explain current conditions, since greenhouse gases were only ~280 ppmv during Medieval time (versus 400 ppmv today). [...] With the increase in irradiance and a decline in explosive volcanism in the early 20th century, global temperatures might then have returned to an unperturbed level similar to that of the MQP [Medieval Quiet Period], but *the rapid rise in anthropogenic greenhouse gases propelled temperatures well beyond that level, as positive anthropogenic radiative forcing overwhelmed natural variability (Myhre et al., 2013).*" https://www.researchgate.net/publication/291523102_The_Medieval_Quiet_Period *"Cloud predictions? A model that predicts clouds is not a model that predicts that clouds are going to threaten humanity."* Stop moving the goal-posts. You claimed that the models made no accurate empirical predictions. I showed you that they made accurate predictions of cloud cover. So you were wrong. Deal with it. *"It makes no sense that experiments have to be repeatable? It's called the scientific method. You really ought to Google that."* I already dealt with this mistake of your's: That makes no sense. For example, various astronomical events are not repeatable, yet these astronomical events still count as evidence for various astronomical theories. Similarly, climate science does not need to repeat various events in order to have evidence. So, once again, one does not need repeatable events in order to have scientific evidence. For example, we have evidence on human evolution from non-human animals, even though we have no repeated that event. We can have a forensic evidence on a murder, even though we have no repeated the murder. *"We are not trying to solve a murder, we are trying to predict the future. Those two operations are NOT analogous." of climate change."* Climate scientists are trying to figure out the causes of climate change, which is analogous to figure out who caused a death. Climate scientists even use terms like "fingerprinting" to discuss trying to figure out the causes of climate change, even different causes of climate change have a distinct pattern or "fingerprint" that can different them from other causes of climate change: "Application of regularised optimal fingerprinting to attribution. Part II: application to global near-surface temperature" "Adaptation of the optimal fingerprint method for climate change detection using a well-conditioned covariance matrix estimate" *"I'll restate my argument: There is no data to tell us what a transition from our current climate to one in which humanity is seriously threatened would look like."* You don't read the peer-reviewed scientific literature, so you have no clue what the data shows. You're just making stuff up. You're like a creationist who claims that there's no evidence of hominid evolution, yet refuses to read any of the scientific research on hominid evolution. You're saying what you want to be true, not what you have evidence for. There's abundant scientific research showing that anthropogenic climate change has caused (or will cause): - increased heat-related mortality (which outweighs any decreases in cold-related mortality) - increased drought intensity - economic losses from sea level rise - increased hurricane intensity - ocean acidification (which results in things such as loss of marine crops and marine food) - reduced crop yields and so on. Here's some research on this, to get you started: "Ice Melt, Sea Level Rise and Superstorms: Evidence from Paleoclimate Data, Climate Modeling, and Modern Observations that 2C Global Warming Could Be Dangerous" "A meta-analysis of crop yield under climate change and adaptation" "Climate Change: Impact on Agriculture and Costs of Adaptation" "Ocean Acidification: The Other CO2 Problem" "Nutrition and income from molluscs today imply vulnerability to ocean acidification tomorrow" "Economic impacts of climate change in Europe: sea-level rise" "Economic losses from US hurricanes consistent with an influence from climate change" "Tropical cyclones and climate change" "Anthropogenic warming has increased drought risk in California" "Contribution of anthropogenic warming to California drought during 2012–2014" "Increasing drought under global warming in observations and models" "Global warming and changes in drought" "Climate warming will not decrease winter mortality" "Winter season mortality: will climate warming bring benefits?"

I don't trust them at all."* Paranoid conspiracy theories from you. Pathetic. It's as silly as saying that: B1) Doctors say "smoking is a danger to humans; one reason for this is that smoking causes lung cancer." These doctors are attempting to use fear and threats to manipulate human behavior according to their beliefs about how humanity should live. I don't trust them at all. B2) Virologists sat that "HIV is a danger to humans, since HIV causes AIDS in humans." These virologists are attempting to use fear and threats to manipulate human behavior according to their beliefs about how humanity should live. I don't trust them at all. *"Bullshit. Willingness to yield to social pressure and consensus is how you authoritarians manipulate people."* Again, this is pseudoskepticism and a foolish refusal to listen to experts who know more than you: "Accounting for the Appeal to the Authority of Experts [...] The account of expert/citizen communication starts by acknowledging the general (if ambiguous) norm: it is imprudent for the nonexpert to go against the expert view (Goodwin 1998). When a local tells a tourist that a road is dangerous, or a doctor advises a patient that smoking is harmful to her health, or *a climate scientist tells the rest of us that the world is warming because of our activities*, then the tourist or patient or we would be dumb keep going along regardless. ‘‘Only the *fool* would not want some expert advice in technical matters’’ (Fischer 2009, p. 139); ‘‘other things being equal, we ought to prefer the judgments of those who ‘know what they are talking about’’’ (Collins and Evans 2007, p. 2)."

Ugj2fJ7V99Tj6HgCoAEC.8ONFW6yvxnP8PypsSnNLPN		0	2017-03-11 16:49:12	Paul Stringini	You did a neat job of avoiding or dismissing every sociological argument I made. When you called my reference to catastrophic global warming a straw man, you actually made a straw man of my argument. What qualifies as a catastrophe? This is what I'm talking about. Out of one side of your mouth you say, I quote, "~86% of climate researchers thought that climate change poses a very serious problem and a threat to humanity:" That sounds catastrophic to me. By the way, the whole "Climate Alarmists vs Climate Scientists" was merely a "tit for tat" ad hominem attack on the motives of scientists. Just as you have essentially been attacking the motives of anyone who dares question their unsupported claim that their observations predict a THREAT to humanity. You denied the validity of skeptics you don't agree with. Do you realize how incredibly childish that is? "They're deniers, not skeptics!" It becomes an essentially sociological argument at that point. It's a "no true Scotsman" fallacy. The globe has undergone many changes while humans have inhabited it. These Climate scientists are obviously no anthropologists. There once was a place called Doggerland, it was swallowed by the sea during a period of global warming, humanity survived. I made no reference to a Venus situation, but I don't know why that would be ruled out in any case. As the most resilient of the large mammals, anything that threatens humans threatens most mammals. Perhaps most chordates. I really don't know because the threat is unspecified. Starting at "a threat to humanity," most humans would consider things that can threaten all of humanity with.... extinction? Sunburns? What is the threat? That's why you people come off as preachy zealots. Amorphous threats are the tools of despots. Cloud predictions? A model that predicts clouds is not a model that predicts that clouds are going to threaten humanity. How are the clouds going to kill us? Are the models predicting consecutive months or years of total cloud cover? That would indeed be a threat. A predictive model has to be relevant to the prediction you are making. We are talking about a humanity threatening change in the earth's climate. Exactly which model predicts that, and exactly what data goes into that. I reassert that any models that predict "a threat to humanity" are not empirical, and probably do not exist. What is happening is that scientists are looking at models that tell them the earth is warming and they make the judgment THEMSELVES that it is a threat to humanity. And what is much more likely is that the global temperature change is a threat to specialized animals in certain cold environments. Here is something for you to think about. If the industrial revolution never happened. And humanity was limited to half a billion people living a sustainable lifestyle. Can you guarantee the climate would never change? Of course not. You made a bad analogy here "We don't need to know all the factors involved in order to know what caused most of the recent warming, just like I don't need to know all the factors involved in a murder to know that the defendant killed the victim." That is a bad analogy. We are not trying to solve a murder, we are trying to predict the future. Those two operations are NOT analogous. Predictive models which lack critical elements will give bad predictions. That is something I should not have to argue. It makes no sense that experiments have to be repeatable? It's called the scientific method. You really ought to Google that. If the climate scientists you are listening to think that experimental data does not need to be confirmed by repeated experimentation and observation, those are not scientists. An hypothesis generated as the result of a single astronomical event would be considered an UNCONFIRMED HYPOTHESIS. An observation is made, an hypothesis is made, more observations, perhaps a prediction. Confirmed predictions from observations of similar events are observed, the hypothesis may be considered confirmed or perhaps plausible. If you see something once, an hypothesis about the observation would not be considered confirmed and any prediction based on those observations would be greeted with natural skepticism. Right now, the "threat to humanity" claim is an unconfirmed hypothesis, not based on observation, but based on conjecture. It is not scientific. Not every statement made by a scientist is a statement of science. I said "There is no data to tell us what a transition from our current climate to runaway global warming would look like." You said" You're attacking a straw man again, since not even the IPCC thinks runaway global warming is likely:" Ok, I told you I was ignorant. I didn't realize the term "runaway global warming" specifically referred to a Venus situation. I thought it just meant irreversible and humanity threatening global warming. I'll restate my argument: There is no data to tell us what a transition from our current climate to one in which humanity is seriously threatened would look like. How bad does the climate have to get in order to threaten one of the most the most adaptable species to ever exist? Catastrophically bad? See, that is what I'm talking about. You are making a distinction without a difference. How bad do the models say it is going to get? How does that compare with changes in global temperature in the past? Climate scientists are attempting to use fear and threats to manipulate human behavior according to their beliefs about how humanity should live. I don't trust them at all. I said, "When I hear appeals to authority and to consensus and see great social pressure being used to push a point, I instinctively dig in my heels. That's just my nature." To which you replied, "That's contrarianism and pseudoskepticism. That is not a good thing." Bullshit. Willingness to yield to social pressure and consensus is how you authoritarians manipulate people. I will never consider my initial reflex to reject majority opinion a liability. It is not to say I don't come around. But I think before I join a crowd. I guess that is because my background is in History.

Our conclusion is therefore that CAGW is simply a *straw man* used by climate contrarians to criticize the mainstream position (50)." *"The models are only accurate to the available experimental data"* No. For example, take the following paper: "Evidence for climate change in the satellite cloud record" That paper compares cloud data, to the cloud predictions made by climate models. The climate models were made before this cloud data analysis was done. So the cloud data (presented in the analysis discussed in the paper) had not yet been fed into the models. Instead, the models were made/published, the cloud data was then analyzed, and then the models were compared to the data. Another example of this is the IPCC first consensus prediction. It fit the data that followed it did rather well, as discussed in the following paper: "Assessment of the first consensus prediction on climate change" *"So when people say 97% of Climate Scientists agree on global warming, I'd like to know just exactly what they are agreeing about."* There's a scientific consensus that: A1) There has been global warming since the mid-20th century. A2) Humans (largely via anthropogenic greenhouse gases) caused most of this recent warming. A3) Most of the recent (or near future) climate change is (or will be) caused by humans. A4) Climate change is a serious problem and/or a danger to humanity. The following paper documents that consensus on A1 and A2: "Consensus on consensus: a synthesis of consensus estimates on human-caused global warming" For the consensus on A3 and A4, among AAAS (American Academy for the Advancement of Science) scientists with relevant expertise, there's a *95%* consensus that climate change was a serious problem and a *93%* consensus that recent warming is mostly caused by humans: "Earth Scientists Views on Climate Change" http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/07/23/elaborating-on-the-views-of-aaas-scientists-issue-by-issue/ And in another survey, *~87%* of climate researchers thought that humans caused (or will cause) most of the recent (or near future) climate change, while *~86%* of climate researchers thought that climate change poses a very serious problem and a threat to humanity: Figures 88 (v043) and 2 (v007) of "The Bray and von Storch 5th International Survey of Climate Scientists 2015/2016" https://www.hzg.de/imperia/md/content/hzg/zentrale_einrichtungen/bibliothek/berichte/hzg_reports_2016/hzg_report_2016_2.pdf *"None of the predictions of these models are empirical."* Nonsense, since the models make empirical predictions that can be compared to the empirical data. *" I'm not convinced that we have come so far that we know all the factors involved"* We don't need to know all the factors involved in order to know what caused most of the recent warming, just like I don't need to know all the factors involved in a murder to know that the defendant killed the victim. *"One of the most important aspects of science is experimentation.

Ugj2fJ7V99Tj6HgCoAEC.8ONFW6yvxnP8Pwgg9Z2u_J		0	2017-03-10 20:50:24	Paul Stringini	The distinction you are making between denialists and skeptics is way too involved for my money. I'm just using the term in the common manner. I'm skeptical. When I say I'm skeptical, I don't mean "professionally," I mean I'm not sure I believe the claims of climate science and I have various reasons which keep me from completely buying into the idea. If I was going to make a convenient distinction to serve my argument, I would make one between Climate Alarmists and climate scientists. A climate scientist has to wait for the result of his prediction to empirically confirm his theory. You don't have that with Climate Alarmists. Climate Alarmists do not wait for data that confirms their prediction, and they are willing to suppress data which refutes their prediction. Climate Alarmism is belief in an unproven prediction that human carbon dioxide emissions will catastrophically alter the Earth's environment. Climate Alarmists have staked entire reputations on these predictions. I don't know much about climate science, but I do know a lot about human nature, and scientists are like all other people. They do not merely make mistakes, they are capable of deluding themselves. If one's immediate superior is a Climate Alarmist, there are many and diverse sociological motives which will effect the gathering and interpretation of data. I have a book called Forbidden Archaeology, which documents cases where members of the scientific community have suppressed evidence and destroyed the careers of colleagues who threatened to undermine consensus on subjects on which prominent community members have built their careers and reputations. "Because the models/simulations are compared to data to make sure they are accurate." The models are only accurate to the available experimental data. The source of experimental data is the actual climate. There is no data to tell us what a transition from our current climate to runaway global warming would look like. Most of the data used to compare with the models is the data gathered "so far." So the predictive reliability of these models is still questionable and could be way off due to yet unknown factor or programing error. None of the predictions of these models are empirical. So when people say 97% of Climate Scientists agree on global warming, I'd like to know just exactly what they are agreeing about. Do they all agree with the dire and unconfirmed predictions of these models? One of the most important aspects of science is experimentation. Experiments have to be repeatable so that results can be confirmed. We don't properly have that with climate science. All we have is a simulation which keeps getting run, over and over, and the scientific nature of that simulated reality is perfectly reasonable to doubt. The climate is a very big thing to study, I'm not convinced that we have come so far that we know all the factors involved and that our simulations are replicating reality. For instance, in chemistry, some reactions have limitations in a given environment. Does the effect plateau? And the degree and nature of the change caused by rising CO2 levels is a question for which we do not have empirical answers. The point of saying that is not to say, "THEREFORE! Climate Change is a Hoax!" I'm not saying that. When I hear appeals to authority and to consensus and see great social pressure being used to push a point, I instinctively dig in my heels. That's just my nature. I frequently play devil's advocate to myself in my own head and try on different ideas. Just going with the crowd is not in my DNA. I understand we can't afford to run the experiment of climate change. In fact, the point of climate alarmism is to force human society to change, using the power of the state, in order to avoid climate change, is it not? So, there are some intense pressures here. If the Climate Alarmists fail to change human activity, and little or no climate change occurs, then the Climate Scientists and Alarmists alike are going to seem more and more like chicken little and will fall into disrepute. On the other hand, if Climate Alarmists succeed in changing government policy, and little or no climate change occurs, they will have succeeded in seizing great power and influence for themselves without having had to prove that any of there predictions were experimentally valid. If they are right, and catastrophic climate change does occur, that is a price no one wants to pay. Even so, if true, the process is not likely to be reversed due to social forces. I recall learning that the last time a single species came to dominate the world it led to a mass extinction (I do not recall if the two were related). Mass extinctions are part of life and death on planet earth. I don't wish to become extinct or to watch the natural world become less rich. But the destruction of one epoch gives rise to another. According to the fossil and geological records, mass extinctions open up new opportunities for new life forms. If the former inhabitants of the earth had never died off, we never would have come to be. We cling to the earth as it currently exists, but it is going to change, whether because of our activity, or because of external factors. Gradually, or suddenly, it will change and various life forms will perish, and new life will emerge, or perhaps, finally, death will reign. That's also a strong consensus opinion out there. OK, that is a very fatalistic view. So, I want to ask, what if there is only marginal climate change? What if the changes in the climate are not catastrophic, but just generally "bad?" And by "bad" I mean that the changes cause smaller extinctions and disturbances to the environment. How small? How about small enough that people will willingly pay the price? Global warming is a bit of a catch-all phrase. How much global warming do all these scientists agree on? Because the amount makes a big difference. Personally, I think that is what causes Climate Alarmists to make dire predictions instead of conservative ones. Climate Alarmists use fear because they know that if we had to sacrifice all the polar bears, so that every human could live that first-world lifestyle, that we would get a solid worldwide majority who would vote to let the polar bears die, and deal with the regret later. That's what I think drives the fear among climate alarmists. They need to use the power of the state to force changes on people before those people realize that climate change may involve prices they are willing to pay in order to live with modern conveniences. Without the fear of catastrophic changes, most humans would be willing to make a devil's bargain to obtain prosperity at the price of environmental degradation. That is what drives Climate Alarmism. There is not enough data to justify Climate Alarmism. That is the outcome I actually find reasonable, because in spite of being skeptical about the claims of climate science, I instinctively feel that having so many people doing so many things is bound to have at least SOME impact. I just question the dire nature of the predictions. I feel that the masses are being manipulated towards panic in order to make them agree to societal changes they would not agree to if they believed the coming climate changes were more minor. I don't mis-remember CARE. I might have their predictive dates off, but it was coming early this (21st) century. This was not some rogue teacher, this was (at least) a district wide program, and probably much larger. I remember the information because it came in the form of worksheets that had some very nice artwork and well crafted propaganda. The information was presented in the form of a letter from the future. A future student was writing back to the 11 year old me in 1984 to tell me what life was like in 20xx). It was striking and haunting. When I said "There's one reason I'm skeptical" that was not a very well written sentence. I should have said "Here's one reason," because I have a number of reasons for being skeptical, none of them very strong, but all joined together they prevent me from believing the claims of climate alarmists. Some more rational than others, but as I said, all uninformed (in terms of climate science). General suspicion is one reason I remain skeptical of the claims of climate alarmists. When I saw, "An Inconvenient Truth," I was somewhat swayed, and seriously considered what the impact of skyrocketing carbon dioxide might be on the environment. The exponential growth on Al Gore's chart was so visibly alarming but when I considered the implications I came to believe that whatever the results are, they are inevitable. In regards to the echo chamber claim. The claim (not mine) that 99% (97%?) of climate scientists agree means that they are indeed in an echo chamber. What comes from their mouths is what they hear from their colleagues, and they may be right, but they are living in an echo chamber. This happens in science all the time. You really need to study scientists from a sociological point of view. Science is empirical, scientists are human. Fantastic claims require fantastic proof. Fantastic claims offered by people living in echo chambers can be reasonably questioned (especially when the evidence is a computer program they all worked on together). If they say global warming is an urgent and existential threat to the earth and that 97% of scientists agree on "climate change" (though it is rarely stated HOW MUCH climate change they agree on) I think it is entirely reasonable to suspect that there are more sociological forces than empirical science at work. I tried posting this earlier but it wouldn't show up. So if this ends up duplicating a post I apologize, I can't see my earlier post.

May I just say though, I wholeheartedly accept the accusation of being selfish, however, you are selfish to the same extent. The concept of 'altruism' is nonsense, all voluntary actions are selfish, for they are all motivated by what we want first and foremost. For example, 'I want to give my pie to someone more in need of it than me' is just as selfish as 'I want to eat my pie myself irrespective of what anyone else needs'.

Re irreplaceable loss of species, I don't care. Humans and other species do not have any 'right' to exist, they do today, tomorrow they don't, so what. Who will be here to care if everyone's dead?

That land area around have lot of dead animals and other biologic materials stored in permafrost that didn't melt for 500 000years. Now is started to melt. Problem is when this start to decompose it will release very potent green effect methane gas. It have 32 times higher effect than CO2. We have there temp. dependent ticking bomb. Problem is that temp. there is rising much faster then on other places on Earth and you know difference between ice and no ice is small. You have on 30°F ice and on 34°F melted thing. This is why we should limit global temp. to 1,5- 2°C (3,6°F) and that's why this 12years. Because if we continue this pace in 12years we will have point with no return. When this thing start to emit that amount of methane earth will start to heat more, than it melts even more and you get even more gas. The reason why this area from north pole is heating so fast is less and less white snow in summer that reflect sun radiation back in space. So less snow more heating and also more methane gas and more water expansion from heated oceans. If we pass that 2°C, it is unstoppable ! Temp of earth will rise more than 5°C than, you have than Antarctic melting. All ice there is on land so sea level rise rate will be higher, then you have permafrost from there.. Then you have further expansion of ocean because heated water expand and then we can talk about significant sea level rise .. That's why AOC said we will have climate disaster in 12years what is not true. I will be START of climate disaster. She was scared when she did read IPCC sr15 report.

We accept the scientific method.  The ones in denial are the those falsely claiming that CO2 drives climate change. It doesn't, and the science proves it doesn't. RSS satellite data proves no warming for 19 years and counting whilst CO2 concentrations have continued to increase. This falsifies their hypothesis. End of story.

Because our atmosphere is acting like a super green house caused by high levels of Co2. In fact, higher than its been in over 800000 years. 3) last time around, 800000 years ago, it took 7000 years for Co2 to rise to current levels whereas this time it only took about 100 years. 4) so if humans are not the cause of the rise in Co2 then simply put what else could be the cause? The sun - no / volcanos - no / asteroids - no....... Climate change skeptics cannot come up with another reason for the increase in Co2 because there isn&#39;t one!

Ugy1Aqn_xSDKzjwN5G14AaABAg	1	0	2020-08-17 22:58:57	Joe Mama	T<br />A few other arguements I’ve created: <br />1. Algae, already inhaling half of all the co2 that’s being inhaled and having exponential growth and the entire ocean to grow, may out grow co2 emissions ( I cant find a lot of studies on algae that can prove/disprove this but it would be fairly easy to test this, I think)<br />2. The sun, emitting different frequencies of light, emits different “amounts” of different frequencies when their are more or less sunspots on the surface. Although the total solar irradiance seems to be hightened by the decrease of sunspots as shown by NASA, their is still the possibility that the lowering number of sunspots has caused frequency shifting in the light coming from the sun, and therefore more light could be absorbed at the surface of the earth where it is “trapped” better than inside higher layers of the atmosphere. Frequency shifting could potentially warm the earth in many other ways. <br />3. The earths magnetic dipole are moving away from true north and south, which may cause more charged particles to enter the atmosphere and heat the earth. This may not seem obvious because true north seems perpindicular to the direction the suns light is coming from, however it is more obvious when you notice that true north is actually slanted and is not completely perpindicular. This is relevant because magnet poles and other areas of a magnetic field are stronger than others, and so stronger areas of earths magnetic field will be better at stopping charged particles than others.

"Although the total solar irradiance seems to be hightened by the decrease of sunspots as shown by NASA" No actually a decrease in sunsports decreases solar irradiance. "ight could be absorbed at the surface of the earth where it is “trapped” better than inside higher layers of the atmosphere" No there is no such possibility...because then we would see an inverse correlation between sunspot activity and temperature...but we dont..the effect of the change of solar irradiance is small anyway, but it is positive...more solar activity warmes thr planet even thought the effect is rather small. 3.".

I personally don&#39;t understand why some people don&#39;t want to do certain things that most agree would help with the issue of climate change, but there is more than one way to help. You don&#39;t have to agree with everyone else, in fact, I think that would be impossible, but, even if you don&#39;t believe in climate change, it wouldn&#39;t hurt to do SOMETHING.

UghXVQpvDxzWA3gCoAEC.87oBh20tXAC88uzD0T1xTj		0	2016-01-12 16:00:07	David Odum	@Robert Massaioli Thanks for the reply. The first one that comes to mind is the Polar Defense Project's kayak expedition. Here is a post explaining some of the problems with that: http://wattsupwiththat.com/2008/09/09/polar-defense-project-deletes-the-tough-questions/ I'm not a wildlife expert, but the polar bears come to mind, as well. Here is an article from 2008: http://www.factcheck.org/2008/06/polar-bear-population/ Here is another page that is up to date (at least 2015): http://www.worldwildlife.org/species/polar-bear There seems to be very little change. The fright is not based upon observation, but on continued assumption. There are other articles I could post about polar bears (i.e., An Inconvenient Truth, Never Look a Polar Bear in the Eye), but maybe you can see why some of us are wary of the sensationalism. Maybe the problem is not always with the actual SCIENTIFIC models themselves. Maybe the problem is that the climate scientists aren't coming down hard and loud on these sensational claims and documentaries. There seems to be a "protect your own" approach, so that the truth isn't what's important, only that people are convinced. That doesn't sit well with me, and makes me immediately wary as someone who is NOT an expert. It's like how people used to use balances to see how much gold was in a bag. If you tweaked the balance, you could cheat the buyer. It's the same thing, but instead of gold it's truth. The balance is tweaked so that more is perceived as truth than is actually true. If I see that, it makes me immediately wary of the peddler of "truth". And who can blame me? Then again, it's hard for even a climate change scientist who supports the global warming consensus to come down hard and loud on these things when he is liable to be attacked and called a quack by his own for doing so. So the movement seems to have created its own monster in regards to that. Then there is this: http://www.drroyspencer.com/2014/02/95-of-climate-models-agree-the-observations-must-be-wrong/ While we're only talking about tenths of a degree here, you must admit that those models seem quite biased the other way, either by human bias or simply by incorrect assumptions. Again, it's hard to blame me for being a doubter, isn't it? I'm not a complete disbeliever, and neither am I an angry die-hard denier. It's just hard to see past the sensationalism, etc. to ascertain whether there is much truth. Yes, it's getting hotter, but that's not the proof, is it? It will usually be getting hotter or colder. If they want to convince people like me—who they actually do, believe it or not, have a chance of convincing—then they could start by using an equal scale of reason. Let the whole movement rise up and silence the sensationalism and fully admit when they are wrong. Then they would have more credibility from me. Do you agree at all?

We're seeing an increase in Carbon-12 to Carbon-13 in the CO2 in the atmosphere, which likely comes from the burning of fossil fuels, which are derived from ancient plant matter; plants prefer to fix Carbon-12 over Carbon-13, which makes the ratio of C-12 to C-13 higher in plants than in the atmosphere.

UgjXa7tKl8UL8ngCoAEC	20	1	2014-12-09 07:23:25	Paul White	Part of the problem, and I agree wholeheartedly with John Oliver, is that every time there&#39;s a debate, we give equal (or <b>more</b>) time to the opposition as we do the proponents. It creates a false air of uncertainty about the issue, when in fact most scientists know climate change is real and caused by humans.<br /><br />Another factor is the current trend of extremism. Left vs. Right, Men&#39;s Rights vs. Women&#39;s Rights, Apple vs. Android. We live in a time where people tend to take one extreme and demonize the other instead of realizing that each side makes valid points. These people are unwilling to entertain ideas that might fall out of line with the rest of their group think, and they&#39;re unwilling to change their mind lest they be called a &quot;flip flopper,&quot; admit they were wrong, or be seen to not have any conviction.<br /><br />This channel poses the statement &quot;It&#39;s okay to be smart,&quot; and that&#39;s fine.

"You're here calling the science into question" I am.  More specifically, I am saying that no one is presenting science and that everyone is saying "trust me."  However, since I do not take a stand on whether global warming is human-caused or not (only noting the tactics of the advocates) it is meaningless to call on me to demonstrate "my" science. "Since I actually acknowledge the facts in the video," The video gives the dogma that you endorse, so you call it "facts."  If I can't test it for myself, I will not be convinced.  But you are going with "we say so" = "science."

You're here calling the science into question so I'm asking your for science. If you don't have any, then that's all the answer anyone needs. You claim there's no actual science involved, huh? OK, then what's the scientific basis for that claim? You give nothing because you have nothing. Since I actually acknowledge the facts in the video, my science is sitting right there above this little discourse. Bon appetit.

Perhaps.  But you are wrong in your claim that I have my ego and identity built into this.  I have not been convinced by anyone's "side."  I do not claim to know the actual reality behind the claims.  Everyone who has claimed to "know" whether global warming is man-made has called for blind faith.  I will, however, accept your assertion that you are blind because you don't want to see. My observation is that there is _no_ actual science involved.  And you are just trying to "win by default."  If I am correct demonstrate that you would not attempt to saddle my claim of "not proven" with "show me YOUR science."

To the extent that people _can't_ "figure it out on their own," you are only able to push forward just another religion.  If people cannot come to a conclusion themselves, the only agreement you can possibly get from them is blind faith. "As for your argument about science and peer review, it's a dead end straw man." Calling it a straw man doesn't make it so.  Do you dispute my observation that religious orthodoxies review works in order to exclude heresies?  Do you dispute my observation that this is, in fact, a peer review? "Just because you may be able to 'win' a debate doesn't make what you say true." I'm not calling on anyone to believe something on the grounds that I said it.  I am stating things that everyone here has already observed.  It may be an inconvenient truth that you are only telling people to _trust_ your review process, while denouncing the self-serving nature of the review processes of other groups.  But we on the outside have no means of telling them apart, and no reason to trust yours. The video starts off with the claim "this is what you need to know."  I see that as a giant red flag.  And if you can't see why, you have no hope of convincing me.  And throughout the video, I can see that I am being called on just to believe.  The biggest problem is that true believers won't even recognize that they are calling for blind faith.  They just complain that people "aren't swayed by facts."

Also, unfortunately, the education in the U.S. in particular (whether public or private) does not educate people to be able to analyze things honestly or comprehensively. Claims are coming from different directions about different things. Any media outlet even pretending to be honest needs to make the effort to bring out the significant variables, mechanics, and dynamics concerning an issue. Bring out the "Left" and "Right" crap and calling it a day doesn't do it justice. If you happen to believe most people are informed, or trained well enough to "figure it out on their own" then you're not well grounded in the reality on the ground. As for your argument about science and peer review, it's a dead end straw man. How about this indiscriminate "truth" you speak of? How about some basic physics, chemistry and biology? How about actual science that addresses the actual science presented in this video? Just because you may be able to "win" a debate doesn't make what you say true.

There shouldn't be. People should be able to draw their own conclusions instead of having the orthodoxy tell them "this is what you must believe." An advocate will always claim that every statement he makes is unquestionably true and that his opponent should just be ignored. And, indeed, this is what you indicate you want. I am the audience. I don't trust anyone. If I detect that you want your opposition silenced, I will conclude that what you say has no merit. And what I will find most convincing is if I can test your proposition myself. If you tell me there is a consensus, you have committed a fallacy. Truth does not care about the popularity of a proposition. If you turn to say "peer reviewed," you should remember that any work produced by a religious orthodoxy is similarly "peer reviewed." The keepers of an orthodoxy review to keep out heresies. And I find it not the least bit surprising that a religion would don a lab coat and masquerade as "science."

That poverty and corruption which is shared, is our doing and we maintain it. That's "modern morals and ethics" for you. As an aside, many cultures were far, far, more peaceful in those places until they a) caught the virus of our culture/mindset. and b) began to be manipulated, controlled and exploiited by us. So your point is moot besides being irrelevant because you failed entirely to answer any of the questions I asked. As for modern conveniences, the progress achievable through material pursuits peaked in the 40's and 50's. Finally, YOU assumed I suggest throwing away conveniences. That's a mistaken assumption. The things and technologies that are indeed useful and helpful are fine. The unending, rampant consumption and waste we don't need. I'm suspecting I'm interacting with someone who either can't or refuses to look at things holistically. For sure, I'm interacting with some who's more concerned with arguing a point than with gaining a more complete and comprehensive understanding of things. In which case, you just stay on that bandwagon.	UCIVdIegzyh2xQOBjKTPvHIg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIVdIegzyh2xQOBjKTPvHIg	1	UgjXa7tKl8UL8ngCoAEC	Paul White

Is it not a far greater risk of even more unintended consequences when we, in our hyperegoic hubris, try to manipulate the climate? We may have all sorts of toys and conveniences, but has our well being gotten better? Maybe lifespans have gotten a little longer, but has true internal quality of life gotten better? Are we more connected on a deeper level or less? Are we better able to live together or less so? Are our neurosis increasing or decreasing? A 60 year life span lived in community, decent health, and psychological and social well being is far superior to a 75 year life lived in fear, isolation, tension, anger, and division.

The earths atmosphere slowly thickens until it gets so thick no heat can get in And an ice age is triggered, the greenhouse gases then diffuse and earth heats back up again.

UghnielPjOYjnXgCoAEC.8DX8sIehtXc8EDjeScFkWw		1	2016-05-23 14:45:59	jet flaque	@Rosanna Miller  Hey! Sorry for the late reply, lots of life happening : ). Yeah I agree, the power of Empirical evidence lies in a specifically defined set of parameters, and the fact that the experiment has to be duplicable, making sure that people can re-con/affirm it and get similar results. Herein also lies the misunderstanding when people talk about for instance the 97% consensus.  It’s not that there was a poll and out of 100 scientists 97 agreed for some reason, out of most of the empirically set up experiments  97% concluded positive on data that potentially points out Anthropogenic climate change (like carbon 12), the remaining 3 didn’t but pretty muc did agree that the climate was in fact changing.  So it’s not a “vote consensus” but a count and divide of empirical data. Evolution is a different topic all together but evolution is in a nutshell another way of saying that if you have a lifeform, and you expose that lifeform to selection pressures, then over x time that lifeform with slightly alter.  We see this all the time in for instance dog breeding (The only difference is that the selection pressure is human intervention or artificial selection, rather than nature.)  So if you for instance want to breed a dog with more aggressive tendencies you select and breed only those who have those tendencies out of the flock and keep doing this tell eventually you end up with a more aggressive dog race. That’s evolution at work right there, it’s the reason we have say.. Pitbulls. I don't see that conflicting with scripture but then again I'm no pastor/priest/specialist in that :) What would prove that climate change doesn’t really exist… oof..that’s a tough one..  it’s hard to disprove the current body of evidence by a just single piece to the contrary, but what it could be like would be for instance drilled ice cores samples that would not display any change in composition over the x thousand year timespan in which the layers grew. Or us detecting only naturally occurring CO2 isotopes in the atmosphere. But alas that’s not what we’ve seen so far. Not by a long shot :( In my experience (but that’s me) science and the scientific method has consistently produced reliable results over time. even though it is always operating in degrees of certainty, rather than absolute certainty. I remain sceptical of various findings however, but the currently body of evidence alongside having witnessed evidence first hand rather than on paper, I have no compelling reason so far to doubt that it’s happening, thus I stick to it (for now).   The correlation between humanity’s activity and climate change is for one highlighted by the amount of fossil fuel carbon isotope levels in the atmosphere vs levels several years back. Something the experiment I told you about earlier directly confirmed. Heh. I’m not a biblical expert of any kind so I can’t tell you if that’s true or not and I don’t really have an opinion on it.. But regardless of the Apocalypse...(and this might be very silly of me so apologies if it is)  but If it is true what you believe, and God did create this world and all its natural beauty.. I’d almost expect that it would be especially the people who deeply believe that this earth was created by God to be most angry towards the fact that humanity is ignorantly polluting and destroying so much of it.   But again that’s just me..I don't know enough about you or your Faith. I do want to Thank you  for your kind words and open mind. may your days be long and full of happiness :)	UCezuDn-UTO8h-N0VjvbtUFA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCezuDn-UTO8h-N0VjvbtUFA	1	UghnielPjOYjnXgCoAEC	Rosanna Miller
UghnielPjOYjnXgCoAEC.8DX8sIehtXc8DzrHNEboqQ		2	2016-05-17 20:03:59	jet flaque	Thank you and cheers :) I should point out though that you didn’t conflate the two in the sense that you mentioned them say directly in the same sentence together, so I should set that right here, but the concept of having faith in God vs conclusions that the scientific method/science makes are just two completely separate issues, hence my confusion. As for your main question… I want to clarify first off that there isn’t one single individual piece of evidence that proves it on itself. A single piece of evidence in almost any hypothesis or scientific theory is not enough by a longshot. The strength/ validity of a theory or scientific conclusion is measured by the body of evidence. So basically the continuously piling amount of evidence, (that each has to undergo scrutiny and critical peer review before it can count as such.) In case of anthropogenic climate change there’s a gigpile of pieces and studies ranging from measuring ocean/ ground acidity and comparing that to geo and ice drills in that date back x time, Vs measurement of solar activity compared to lower atmospheric heating and the amount of carbon twelve located there.. The video points to most of these though sometimes in not very convincing tiny nutshell. This is because the problem with a body of empirical evidence is that the more detailed and abundant it gets, the harder it becomes to communicate to a layman’s audience. If one isn’t somewhat educated in the subject, eyes quickly glaze over if you know what I mean. (hence me pointing to the link in the description/google Scolar search for sceptics like yourself (that’s a compliment by the way). If you however still don’t trust any of the (I think it’s around 12 thousand from the top of my head?) papers/experiments/studies etc. You can of course always set up an valid empirical study/ scientific test for yourself, but that takes a lot of effort/time. Now being a former technical university student, (though with a completely different degree) I did have the opportunity to be a part of an university experiment once taking weather balloon measurements of CO2 in the atmosphere and its specific isotopes. So yeah I’m definitely convinced that the climate is changing and that humanity plays a huge roll in it. Despite whatever politicians/industrials agenda, both from the peer reviewed studies by various experts as well as testing/witnessing the results myself first hand (though that was just a single experiment/measurement) by the way, one of the key merits in finding truth, any truth is Skepticism and Honesty and you’ve shown both of those so Kudos to you for that 	UCezuDn-UTO8h-N0VjvbtUFA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCezuDn-UTO8h-N0VjvbtUFA	1	UghnielPjOYjnXgCoAEC	Rosanna Miller

But I guess I don't know how I conflated the two. I brought God up because there are a lot of people, including Obama, pressuring everyone to believe in climate change. Since I am always asked for proof, even though that's not what religion is about and I haven't asked anyone to believe in my God. If they really want to find Him, they will need to seek Him on their own. I cannot give what He gives Himself to those He chooses. So I am basically here figuring out why I should believe. And thus far, I hear a lot of nothing coming out of the mouths of the climate-change believers but no proof. I really didn't need to bring Him up. I wasn't comparing God with science though. My question was, what is the evidence that proves climate change? Again, I understand the scientific method. BTW, you did a beautiful job in explaining it. I needed a refresher, it's been awhile since I was in school. Lol Do you believe in climate change? Why or why not?

UghnielPjOYjnXgCoAEC.8DX8sIehtXc8DtaJFaa75x		1	2016-05-15 09:40:15	jet flaque	@Rosanna Miller No probs, your welcome :), B the W I understand from you comments that (x) God plays a huge part in your life, that's fine, I'm not challenging that at all here...I'm pointing out that God(s)/Religion(s) and science are separate, not mutually exclusive issues, so i didn't and still don't understand why you would conflate the two. Science and the scientific methode deals with the natural (world), God(s) (by definition) and Religion deal with the metaphysical/supernatural. completely different ballgame. So if scientific research in various fields generates a body of evidence pointing out that say..gamma rays exists and that they're fatal when long exposed to them... then that has no impact whatsoever on whether a God exists yes or no and whether or not you believe that or "have faith" in that. this graph pretty much illustrates how science operates, http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/The_Scientific_Method_as_an_Ongoing_Process.svg/2000px-The_Scientific_Method_as_an_Ongoing_Process.svg.png how falsificiation, (re) testablity and (re) verification of data by independent peers create a constantly improving picture of the natural (so not the supernatural) world. The word of prominent (x) scientist in that perspective is irrelevant if his research does not hold up to peers and/or is proven to be flawed on (x) subject using the methodology above. This is also where religion and science differ.	UCezuDn-UTO8h-N0VjvbtUFA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCezuDn-UTO8h-N0VjvbtUFA	1	UghnielPjOYjnXgCoAEC	Rosanna Miller

I guess you haven't learned yet that, for some of us, God is all that matters and nothing apart from Him exists. Without God, it dies, for He is life itself. Anyways, I understand Science since God is the original Scientist. He is the Truth, Way, and Life. You have separated, or tried to anyway, faith from life. By doing so you give up many wonderful things unproven by science (not really ever meant to be proven because it gives up the beauty of it all). "Things" like beauty, love, hope, peace, etc. BTW, when you speak about things that are verifiable, falsifiable, testable....what do you mean? Do you believe in everything that scientists claim to be true or have you verified these facts yourself?

I just don&#39;t think that I should have to spend more hours fixing your work. <br />In response to your preamble, I&#39;d like to say that what scientists do or do not agree on or believe should be of little consequence anymore than when politicians want to disagree with facts. Most scientists of their day didn&#39;t believed Galileo, Pastuer, or Alfred Wegener. What science can PROVE, IS important.<br />Psychological statements like, &quot;The climate ship has left the dock,&quot; inferring that those who disagree are left behind those who are so much more enlightened is, to be frank, insulting. You will get no one to listen to your arguments except those who have already been indoctrinated. You change nothing, nor change anyone&#39;s mind using this technique. Maybe I should re-phase that to no will change their mind to your way. <br />Using words like &#39;could happen&#39; or &#39;might happen&#39; throughout your presentation does not give me a clear sense of your absolute knowledge of the science. Nor does not predicting larger hurricanes beforehand, but adding them after-the-fact to your repertoire of justifications. <br />Item 3. Since CO2 levels have only been measured since 1958, how does the WMO know what levels were before 1790? It&#39;s a SWAG (scientific wild a$$ guess). The fine print on page 2 admits that they are making an assumption. And we all know what ASS-U-ME means, right? This is not the science fact that you promised. Item 6-same problem. <br />Item 7- CO2 levels haven&#39;t been this high (&gt;400 ppm) since before humans existed. And your point is.....? I could say that it hasn&#39;t been this dark since last night. What does my statement prove? The bottom line is that there was a time that CO2 levels were this high and human intervention was definitely not to blame. It&#39;s been 70-80 times that amount of time since that last real dinos roamed the earth. One million years is nothing, when compared to the life of this planet. I could easily deduce that the cycle for this higher concentration is 1 million years and that this is normal. Yes, I know that this is most likely not true. I recognize the human hand of destruction to our environment. But, I also don&#39;t recognize how your statement is an absolute proof in yours or anyone&#39;s theory. You&#39;ve basically stated that there are times that CO2 is high and humans had nothing to do with it.<br />Item 10- You show that, worldwide, all volcanoes are only responsible for 0.2 gigatons, or 200 megatons (million tons) of CO2. But, the same source that you, yourself used clearly states that just one volcano, Mt. Pinatubo, is thought to have injected more than 250 megatons of gas into the upper atmosphere on A SINGLE DAY. It also states that in an AVERAGE year, volcanoes release between about 180 and 440 million tonnes of carbon dioxide. I&#39;d say 200 was low-balling the estimates since we don&#39;t even know what an average year looks like. Yes, we&#39;ve been measuring CO2 for 70 years. Compare that with the Earths 5 billion year age and the solar and earth tilt cycles that can take millions. We can&#39;t have a real average of volcanic output, just another rough SWAG. <br />You wouldn&#39;t normally use two languages to write one argument, so don&#39;t use two measuring systems. In 18 you state that ocean levels are rising by 1/10th inch per year. At the end of your video you state that with the current trend, ocean levels will be up 1 Meter by the end of the century. 0.1 inch = 2.5 mm x 100 (years)= 250mm. That&#39;s 1/4 of a meter (did you see how I used your trick of cross measurement there?) And with the fact that electric vehicles and alternative energy sources are in their infancy, this means things will get better without the hype. But, still, if you&#39;re going to exaggerate your numbers, try to keep your answers the same throughout your argument. And no, I didn&#39;t fact check either of these numbers. I just found an inconsistency in your statement. <br />For the record, I would like to say that I thought I was a believer in climate change. I certainly was more of one before I watched this video. I would love to believe that we humans have the power within our grasp to lower ocean levels, acid levels, and stop mass extinctions, hurricanes or any other natural disasters. But, what I want and what I get are not always the same. I certainly want to believe that our scientists wouldn&#39;t collude in emails and texts to make sure that they get their facts correc........the same. I would also like to believe that they are considering all the facts. But, I am beginning to believe that climate scientists are deliberately avoiding some very important points. <br />Even I know about Milankovitch Cycles. I also know that the billions of square kilometers of land that were buried under 3-5 km thick ice sheets, were compressed by all that weight.I know that even today it continues to rise (an estimated 1 km so far) since the ice melted, back to it&#39;s normal height. This has led to more water shedding off into the oceans. <br />I know that the drying up of the Great Salt Lake (think Lake Superior emptying into the ocean), the Caspian and Aral Seas, and other trapped inland waters, along with the emptying of the prehistoric aquifers, both under the U.S. and Canada, and the Sahara desert being pumped dry means that these water displacements have to go somewhere and be accounted for. This planet is a closed loop system. No one seems to be taking these facts into account when measuring the height of the rising oceans. How do we stop the Great Salt Lake and others from evaporating? Do we tell the Russians and Africans that they are not allowed fresh water to drink and grow their food? Maybe we should tell North Americans to conserve their dwindling aquifer by not growing corn for ethanol or eating so much? OK, forget that last one. That&#39;s actually a good idea. <br />And I haven&#39;t even gotten into the Gulf of Mexico coastal erosion caused by the US army corps of engineers, or the Gulfs dead zone, or the assumption (note the word assume) that the Sahara is covered in green for thousands of years due only to a minor shift in the Earths tilt in one of those previously described cycles, Possibly every 30-40,000 years. And we have no control over this, either.<br />In conclusion, we non-scientist outsiders don&#39;t have a problem believing REAL science. Pythagoras&#39;s theorem can be proven again and again. Einstein&#39;s theory of relativity can be shown to be accurate the same as Darwin&#39;s theory can be. Yet, despite your best selling methods, what few climate control predictions there are appear to be failing almost as badly as Y2K and 2012. One degree rise over decades does not evidence give. Especially if, as one real scientist, with a Nobel prize points out, your data is flawed. And maligning his reputation proves more about who you are than countering his argument. Also, that rise in temperature can be explained with other facts that are out of our control.<br />Now, can we move on to the real science? Watching the ozone layer closing back up because of the direct efforts of scientists and nations working together; this is real science. There&#39;s plenty of evidence for humans polluting the earth and her oceans. THIS can be shown in video and documentation. THIS can be proven to be true to those who want to see real, honest data. Fix THIS and maybe your climate predictions will also be proven; or not. What matters most to me is that we are able to pass on a clean (cleaner?) environment to our children. I think we can all agree on this.	UC06XuhFDCkf4fDV1s4EpCEA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC06XuhFDCkf4fDV1s4EpCEA	0

Most importantly, what&#39;s the deal with the so called pause or hiatus in warming? What about the failure of the climate models to predict the pause in warming. Those are the two big ones that I hear all the time. There might be one or two others that escape me at the moment.

Remember the part where he said an analysis of the carbon dioxide isotopes of the atmosphere shows that the majority of the newly created C02 molecules came from human production methods?

Humans are the primary cause of this upward temperature shift. The sooner we realize it, the sooner we can get to fixing it (before it's too fucking late).

We have multiple agencies confirming the same data. 2> they also released data of rising temperatures of the globe from 1940-2019 and stated 2019 was the hottest year of all time. They state every next year turns out to be hottest which only makes sense with the concept of green housing of gases.

They are carefully funneling information to us. The news media does it all the time. You only see what they want you to see, and nothing outside those parameters. That's why they hate citizen-level reporting and have begun to stifle, block and "fact-check" non-MSM information. Instead of addressing it with real verifiable information. Scientists shouldn't be afraid to say, "You're right, this data doesn't fit the climate change data, but the preponderance of data shows..." or something to that effect. Or even show with hard data how many studies back up their claims, and how many DON'T because then people can see the percentage of data that supports climate change. Only showing data that supports your argument while restricting and omitting data that doesn't is not how you build trust.

But, from the moment we are dealing with facts, we shouldn&#39;t be talking about believes but about accepting and denying. We cannot BELIEVE in a fact. At least we can THINK that a fact is true or wrong. <br /><br />The proofs that exist for a human made climate change are true, if we understand the context where they were made and the methodology used to actually create those proofs. If a scientist would have used another system of thinking or another methodology he would have found another result, he would have other proofs.<br /><br />And I think that, this issue is the very problem in the climate change debat. Wether or not our methodology and context influence the proofs that we use to deny or accept the reality around us.<br /> 	UCREihCE7IfOCJtJpuDwSVqQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCREihCE7IfOCJtJpuDwSVqQ	0

You could combine hydrogen and oxygen to produce water and get some energy. There's already a hydrogen-fuel cell car available. Problem is, produce hydrogen is still going to take some polluting method. I heard a while back that some people came up with a pretty decent method for getting the hydrogen but it'll probably still take some time until they improve it, make it cheaper, more efficient, and open to the public. But, I don't really expect it to be much gain again climate change. Coals and natural gas would still used probably since people are pretty energy-hungry and the energy is easier to extract. Meanwhile, climate change probably wouldn't be solved just by an engine. Some have claimed that climate change may be irreversible. As Joe said, there's a positive feedback, sunlight melts iceberg leads to less reflection, leading to more melting.

"IF you know that neither of your statements were true, but can't see the point of me saying....." Um... 'both' of my statements were true. Look, you can jump to ad hominom all you want (which is basically your way of forfeiting the argument which means you do understand my points were correct and you are wrong, so yay, win for me I guess), but not a single thing you've said has been true.  Let me disprove your points again. 1. I've never said that solar cycles aren't real. I know they are. There is the cycling the sun itself goes through and there is the mild shift in the orbital shape of the Earth's orbit around the sun (sometimes more circular, sometimes more elliptical, I forget the name). However, these cycles have little to no impact on the current warming trends we are seeing. That's what I've said. Three times now. The fact that you misunderstood is NOT my problem. 2. I would LOVE to see the study that says all of this, because it seems like an interesting enough study to read (and it also takes legitimate evidence for the over 100% claim). I know humans are contributing to/the cause of the rapid global warming we are experiencing today. It seems like you're trying to convince me that global warming is real (which I already know it is) which makes you (to quote your own words) "incredibly stupid". Try to make your points without being the most arrogant, condescending, pretentious asshole in this entire thread. I didn't insult you a single time and you immediately assumed I was stupid and/or intellectually dishonest. You're incredibly, ASTOUNDINGLY arrogant. Grow up.

Solar cycles were dis-proven. They don't have any real effect on the climate, especially not to these extremes. Also, "suspicious0bservers" is NOT a credible source, AT ALL. Use reputable agencies who employ scientists in the relevent fields. And every one of those reputable agencies is in agreement that global warming is real and man-driven. It's not lead by solar cycles or the slight change in the shape of the Earth's rotation around the sun or any of that stuff.

Some people (and no offense to ppl in the USA but in your case a HUGE amount of people) can't seem to understand the sheer magnitude of our planet, this thing is HUGE and just because in "my surrounding region, witch represents about 0.5% of the earth surface" temperatures are lower doesn't mean the same is happening with the other 99,5% of the world. To me some people just need to leave their homes and travel the world to see HOW MUCH climate change is already affecting the life style and economy in some regions of the globe, specially poorer areas, where the government and the population in general don't have the money to deal with it.

Lower solar activity flies in the face of rising average temperatures. And if the polar vortex really made as big of a difference as some people think, then, again, we would see plateauing or falling average global temperatures. Just because some areas are having record lows doesn't mean we can ignore the more plentiful cases of record highs (which he mentioned). The key thought here is, "global AVERAGE temperature."

However, some people walked outside one day and saw snow and said, "OH NO! THOSE DIRTY SCIENCE GUYS LIED TO US! SEE?! IT'S COLD OUTSIDE!" So scientists decided it was time for a term that would, hopefully, at least allow them to get a word in edgewise against cries of, "COLD (in my area) != WARMING (globally)".

Climate change I'd the change of overall weather across the entire globe, and it's getting warmer.

Humans have a large hand in it but there are many other variables. Such as the solar cycles. Our star is at a very low point in sunspots and solar radiation output. (Suspicious0bservers) There is also the polar vortex that seems to be acting more wild than usual. (ISWA) Many parts of the globe have experienced all time record low temps. (Suspicious0bservers) There are many things I don't know or can't recall exactly where I got the information from but this video does an even worse job explaining it. 	UC1Qr9ApATOX96Y-NOzAgzWw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1Qr9ApATOX96Y-NOzAgzWw	1	Ugj9m1ATnyFcNHgCoAEC	Luna Nordiq
Ugj9m1ATnyFcNHgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-NoXe7-H7vss1Tg5		7	2014-12-09 01:24:10	Brett Friesen	There's a difference between short term weather patterns and long term weather patterns. Short term weather is constantly changing and dynamic and even subtle changes in a system can affect it. Long term patterns on the other hand are the average and the key point to take from this is AVERAGE change in weather patterns over an extended period of time. Now I have no idea if you have read any Scientific journals stating these facts and if you have could you please provide references as I would like to review them as well. But in the case that you haven't and this is unreliable information based on your own personal Conjecture, there are numerous Scientific studies and journals about this subject and I recommend you review those before stating facts that are most likely untrue. Rest assured the mathematics and statistics of this information all point to the conclusion that we are the sole reason for the unprecedented rise in temperatures over the globe. And please understand that it isn't some cover up to make Al Gore polar bear king like the video said. If this wasn't an issue then climate Scientests wouldn't be wasting their time on it. The point is to keep the world as stable and good a place as possible so even on the off chance that you are correct in your assumptions isn't that a noble cause to strive for anyways? I mean it's not like this is for the benefit of a specific organization or anything like that.
