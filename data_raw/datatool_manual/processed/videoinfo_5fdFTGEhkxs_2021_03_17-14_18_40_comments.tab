Ugwb46wHmmFpo1lwtZ94AaABAg	1	3	2020-03-04 23:20:18	Empire Cases	I lived in Vietnam (Ho Chi Minh City) from 2004 until 2014. I first was there in 2002 to do a magazine feature story and basically fell in love with the country at the beginning of the rise from poverty.<br />There were so many fascinating things to explore and opportunities were everywhere. I saw the transformation of many of the countries tourist destinations transform to become 5-star resort areas that helped local economies and gave the country hope for a bright future, I mention tourist areas only because of the changes from the natural state as fishing villages or crudely developed holiday areas for locals transformed the shorelines and beaches drastically but just a few years later started to show evidence of erosion and shrinking beaches. Just prior to seeing the effects of climate change I was buying a property on the beach in an area that was primarily a fishing community that was not far from Mui Ne and destined for development. The land was quite low, sandy, with hills behind that would get washed out after heavy rains and began to worry that soon the beach may erode so far back that any house built would be very vulnerable in the future. Maybe I missed out on getting a beachfront property that globally is becoming extremely expensive and difficult to find but after seeing what some resorts were starting to have to deal with I was nervous and backed out.<br />Years of seeing huge changes all over Vietnam while also seeing changes with the climate that was even noticeable to me, who only witnessed a short period of time, made me wonder how the hell can the country cope with what is to come. Vietnam as it was before climate change started showing obvious effects already met many struggles with flooding, washouts, poor infrastructure to control the flooding from the heavy rains. It&#39;s very sad, Vietnam has never been an easy place for the people to live in but you&#39;ll never find more resilient people anywhere so hopefully, they will find the will to combat what&#39;s to come and be able to rise from the challenges.

What is perceived is actually the effects of UNBRIDLED COMMERCIALISM, LOCAL MISMANAGEMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENT, and definitely not rising sea levels. People's IGNORANCE of basic science (water seeks its own level) is played up along with FEAR MONGERING. It's not that sea levels rise in one part of the globe but not in other parts. üòÇüòâNOTHING IS MORE LUDICROUS AND OUTRAGEOUS!! People are being dumbed down.

Both Vietnam and Cambodia will benefit. However, Cambodia has a lake, the Tonle Sap, that receives seasonal overflow from the Mekong. The reduction in the highest lake levels will probably reduce flooding. But nobody quite knows what effect lower peak water level in the lake will have on fishing and the area of paddy rice cultivation.

It fluctuates over periods of 60 years, etc. These fluctuations are misinterpreted as going in one direction, but in reality rainfall and temperature fluctuate up and down 30 years in one direction and 30 years in the other direction. Some cycles are longer than 60 years. We hear much about the atmosphere as the driver of climate change, but in reality it is the oceans that drive climate. Recall that the Earth's atmosphere up to 10 kilometers (33,000 feet) has a mass equivalent to the top 10 meters (33 feet) of the ocean. Plus the area of world oceans is more than twice the area of all the land. Thus, if you wish to study the Earth's climate, study the oceans and its currents and oscillations, PDO, AMO, ENSO, etc.	UCR-JIdhjRa9zYK-LodxG-Ng	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR-JIdhjRa9zYK-LodxG-Ng	1	UgxpKj0Cj7LH3MlhIxZ4AaABAg	DarkAngel63725267

Firstly, ALL river deltas will meander considerably so expecting any house to be safe on a delta river bank is foolish. Secondly, water extraction has accelerated from practically nothing 30 years ago to the 2.5 million cubic liters now sucked out of the delta&#39;s water table every day. This is causing considerable subsidence; who&#39;d of thought? Thirdly the Mekong is heavily dammed with more dams on the way. <br />&quot;...the amount of nutrient-rich sediment flowing downriver has already declined dramatically, so much that a UNESCO report has warned that Chinese dams built on the upper sections, known as Lancang, have caused a 70% reduction in sediment, which will adversely impact fisheries and rice production in Cambodia and Vietnam.&quot;<br />And... &quot;A total of 11 mainstream dams and 120 dams on tributaries are planned, which scientists warn will imperil the already fragile river system.&quot;<br />I know, let&#39;s blame it on the UK&#39;s Industrial Revolution and all those 19th century UK factory workers and their descendants?
