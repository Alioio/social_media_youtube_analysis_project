title	Tropical Rainforest - Secrets of World Climate #1 (New Version)
description	NEWLY ENHANCED EDITION WITH AN EXTRA MINUTE OF FOOTAGE AND INFO! The tropical rainforest. When we hear this, maybe we think of steamy jungles of Indonesia and Malaysia, the Amazon, Borneo, Java, Bali, the Congo of Central Africa, or the lush islands of the South Pacific. See this part of the planet like you've never seen it before, in an original new earth documentary, exploring the geography of our planet's equatorial zone. I'll explain how it is that this region experiences huge amounts of rain all year round, the biodiversity that results from the combination of all this rain in this tropical heat, and the countries and cities that lie within its influence. The first episode in a geography series showcasing our beautiful planet, themed by all its major climate zones, here we show this part of the world in its full beauty, and uncover the secrets of why it is that way. Countries featured in this climate zone are: Costa Rica, The Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela, Brazil, Peru, Bolivia, Congo, Uganda, New Guinea, Fiji, French Polynesia, Palau, Malaysia, Indonesia and The Philippines. Cities featured in this climatic region are: Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and Hilo.
