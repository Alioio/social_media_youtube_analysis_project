Countless experiments and studies in every single possible field are going on all the time. When we are considering the state of the environment, all studies are relevant. The individual scientists or groups of them studying specific topics like, the ones who study amphibians, for instance... they aren&#39;t comparing notes with the &#39;melting ice&#39; scientists or the &#39;ocean salinity&#39; scientists or the &#39;high altitude particulate&#39; scientists, or the &#39;rate of crop failures&#39; scientists, or even NASA. ALL of the collected scientific studies of land and sea and air phenomenon and trends must be collated, cross-referenced and organized. I have watched countless climate change discussions and it many concentrate on only a small part of the available information. But Guy McPherson has put much effort into gathering and comparing the findings of many many studies from across the spectrum of fields. If we are to believe in science, his conclusions are worthy of our attention. I really enjoy how Mr. Stossel presents his little videos. This one, though, is not a favourite.

Yes.<br /><br />But are humans responsible for the warming in the last 50-100 years? Yes.<br /><br />If humans are responsible, and keep on this path, will there be <b>much more</b> warming in the next 50-100 years? Yes.<br /><br />Will climate change hurt everyone? Probably not. Canada, with under 40 million people, will see a longer growing season. But India, Indonesia, Africa, and Australia, where BILLIONS live, will face days where it is dangerous to merely be outside because its so hot. The US west will face more catastrophic fires. The sea will rise to cover parts of coastal counties in the US and elsewhere.<br /><br />Is this just another case of scientists crying wolf? We already saw this play out in in the course of MONTHS. In Spring 2020, politicians were telling us not to worry about Covid because it would go away &quot;like a miracle&quot;. Now, half a million dead later, we see that the pessimists were right. How many times do we have to ignore warnings before we learn our lesson?	UCJdp1G6AE6Dd4La91MGWDMg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJdp1G6AE6Dd4La91MGWDMg	0

And that all the So call &quot;Greens&quot; are all former recycled &quot;Reds&quot; from the Communists from the Cold war period. We &quot;need collectivism,&quot; they say and Government ownership of industry and people, totally intolerant of anyone that disagrees with them. Sounds familiar. They also need child sacrifice, and cows too. sounds familiar? Your dog, child, wife, cow, chicken all exhale Co2. what they say will end the world. But of course, if we sacrifice all our children, kill off our cows, give up all our rights freedoms, and money to a totalitarian state then the world will be saved????? Sounds Familiar???

These storms WOULD NEVER have been called hurricanes in the past! The only thing anthropogenic going on is the fudging, misrepresentation, and lying in the name of political agenda. But I'm not saying humans aren't changing the climate. I'm saying plants and insects and other living things are changing it far more. Shouldn't we attempt to understand the contribution of other species before deciding we are the sole climate changers? The system is far more complicated and buffered than "CO2 is a greenhouse gas, and we make CO2 by burning ffs. Hell, returning lost carbon to the biosphere may be the best thing we (or any species) may have ever done for life on our planet!

Well, for coastal countries it could be really bad. Also, fossil fuels increase acidity which destroys planktons which can be really bad. I say, go nuclear and reduce fossil fuel consumption.<br /><br />2) What is the hurry with fossil fuel consumption? Fossil fuel will not disappear and it is limited. Why not path the way for our descendants to meet their energy needs when fossil fuel is gone? It is selfish to over-consume limited commodity just to feel good now but our future children to suffer. I say go nuclear.<br /><br />3) It is a stupid argument to look at a small scale to check if the temperature rise is dangerous. Maybe it is not at the moment but if the trend continues it could be catastrophic and even Judith Curry agrees with that. <br /><br />It is the same as if someone just started running and you ask if they lost weight and because they did not, then it is not effective.

Ugz7N2wrKzizn7NrzMJ4AaABAg	0	6	2021-02-16 10:26:30	Ari S	Okay so to sum up: climate change is slow, and Stossel and his guests are not sure if the rise in temperatures will be harmful.<br /><br />Here&#39;s the other side - the global temperature rise in the last 100 years has not happened at this speed for 5000 years. We covered a 4 degree rise in the last 5000 years (0.08 degrees per century). In the last 100 years we saw a rise of 0.7 degrees.<br /><br />TLDR - the process is speeding up. Now, this may seem like a small amount, but bear in mind - this is global average temperature (including temperatures from the extreme places like the Arctic / Egypt). Even a degree increase means a much higher temperature in hotter regions.<br /><br />Okay that&#39;s fine - but is it harmful? Stossel and his guests are right, it&#39;s not easy to say. This is a change which usually happens over thousands of years, and it&#39;s hard to understand exactly what will go wrong. However, the answer does not seem to be &quot;nothing&quot;. Lets keep in mind that human beings were born and evolved over the last 300,000 years, following a slow rise in temperatures. We&#39;ve never really seen a major temperature variance over such a short duration.<br /><br />Another thing scientists agree on is that life on earth helps maintain the temperature. Before life existed, the climate of our planet was weird - everything was either lava or it rained for a million years. In a way, all the plants and trees have helped create a temperature necessary for survival.<br /><br />And we have suddenly destroyed all of it. 90 percent of wildlife areas have vanished over the last few hundred years, with entire species getting wiped out overnight. This is obviously why we are seeing an accelerated temperature rise. Let&#39;s be very clear about one thing - if we destroy all the other species on our planet, we will definitely go extinct.<br /><br />So keeping the above history and context in mind, we can agree on one thing - this is definitely a real problem that needs to be headed off at the pass. Not being able to understand the change is not a good enough excuse to ignore it. I agree with Stossel and his guests that maybe we can be a little less thuggish about how we discuss this topic, but the simple fact is that if the balance of life is disturbed, life for human beings will get worse.<br /><br />TLDR: Climate change is real. We may not know how it impacts us, but we do know that it impacts us.	UCFdaPQQ-2QIRALD9t2BKjzg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFdaPQQ-2QIRALD9t2BKjzg	0

He is invested in being a denier<br />Deforestation is real, which is leading to habitat destruction that is excelerating the extinction of hundreds of species far faster than natural causes.<br />Our oceans are heavily polluted with plastic, the Gulf of Mexico is severly polluted with oil and agricultural runoff. Fish stocks are being depleted faster than they can reproduce. Coral reefs are being destroyed<br />These ecosystems are critical to the natural balance that allows us to live on this planet, we can&#39;t just brush this off as inconsequencial.<br />The good news is new research is moving away from the idea of cutting emissions and towards sequestation, drawing CO2 back into the Earth. It&#39;s done through cleaning up the oceans and improving farming methods by making soil more CO2 absorbent, far cheaper and effective than wind turbines and solar panels	UCxmoM9Ewi31Mjon0xTNiwxQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxmoM9Ewi31Mjon0xTNiwxQ	0

Regretfully you must provide solutions that work within a economical model or it will never be accepted. So rather then shoving the change down peoples throats, develop and implement the green industry before you destroy the fossil fuel industry. <br />Help pay for solar, wind and alternative sources by promoting tax breaks and such, develop the industry and create jobs, then fossil fuels will go away by themselves.

They all thought 2000 was so far away, why worry? Whe they realized something needed to be done they all had to scramble. The reason Y2K was a dud was because companies spent a fortune fixing the problem. No airplanes were bever gonna fall out of the sky, that was just hype. When maintenence was just based on elapsed time like say 3 months or 20K miles, it&#39;s not using a specific hard coded date so the date doesn&#39;t matter.

Pretty much all the scientists agrees that only a few degrees of global mean (which looks like nothing), can trigger a lot of snowball effects... The last 6% of scientists that contradict the facts have a conflict of interest with industry corps (they get paid to do BS science)...

Think for yourself people. If we don&#39;t do everything in our power to minimize GW, we will have a mass climate refugee problem on our hands in our kids lifetime. Also mass desertification, starvation and droughts. Heck, the climate at my house has changed dramatically in the last 20 years. Its never real cold and snows here anymore and it barely rains. Other places like the Gulf Coast get more intense Hurricanes than ever before, and the Midwest gets more floods than ever. We humans have done this (with a big push from JD Rockefeller) to ourselves in the last 150 years (read: Industrial Revolution) , the only species on the planet that fouls our own nest. Sad that it has become a political event instead of everybody working together to fix it.

If there&#39;s one thing we learn about giant chaotic systems with a multitude of variables is that one tiny change in a single variable can cause very big changes to the whole system that are practically impossible to predict (butterfly effect). <br />We can take ecosystems as an example; there have been cases in which people, simply by introducing foreign bacteria into a new environment destroyed an entire ecosystem. Nobody could have possibly predicted something like that.<br /><br />The climate and the multitude of complex systems which depend on the climate are all in a very fine equilibrium; an equilibrium in which humanity and most life on earth has evolved and thrives under. It is very reasonable to assume that by tipping the climate, we would create very drastic changes to the natural world down the line. It is pretty much a certainty. What these changes will be and when they will come, nobody can say in the moment. But rest assured that a change in the environment in which are bodies have evolved for millions of years cannot be a good thing. The right thing to do is to respect the equilibrium of nature. Neglecting this issue just because we cannot exactly predict the consequences is a big mistake. And what is the reason to neglect these issues? Simply greed and the desire for more. More production, more money, more comforts, eat more, move faster, reproduce at any cost and fuck everything and anyone .

Even if 97 percent of climate scientists agreed on human-caused climate change, it wouldn&#39;t mean anything on its own because truth isn&#39;t decided by a majority vote. If 97 percent of people believed that 2+2=7, that wouldn&#39;t make it true. At one time, there was a &quot;scientific consensus&quot; that the sun orbited around the Earth and that infections were caused by bad air rather than germs. This isn&#39;t to say that human-caused climate change isn&#39;t real, only that the evidence is not nearly as conclusive as it&#39;s made out to be.

Stossel’s covered the alarmists quite well and funding behind it, he always gets my attention. We know the models have too many variables to predict with any certainty, esp what directions countries and politicians will go in, so it makes scientists job even more difficult with models. Not sure that should be the main focus. What Stossel’s didn’t touch on are the Climate Deniers and the big money funding them. Start with the Koch brothers, and the 156 members of Congress who have signed the pledge to not tax them, but let the public clean up the mess (see Dark Money). Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and mostly Republicans have signed the pledge.But there are plenty of other big oil players, dirty coal companies that are funding politicians and their campaigns, and don’t want their companies to die out either. It reminds me of the tactics the tobacco companies used in denying their products caused higher rates of cancer. Stossel’s just skips the Denier side with big oil and others funding such politicians, doesn’t even cover that aspect with this piece. We do know the high CO2 levels are unprecedented, see NASA’s site, and why our oceans are warming, coral reefs are dying off, many animal and insect populations are on the decline, to say nothing of what consequences it’s going to have on our tree and plant species. Most scientists readily admit their models are far from perfect, but most are very concerned. What are the consequences of doing nothing to the unprecedented rising CO2 levels and what will it be like by year 2100? It doesn’t look good and deserves our full attention. I’m a big fan of Stossel’s, but feel like he didn’t cover this well or balanced at all, unlike many of his other pieces. I hope he’ll do a future piece, esp cover the funding of who is behind the Climate Deniers and what is at stake for them.

Ugy6HWAPwx7ZApIk70x4AaABAg	6	1	2020-11-26 22:46:36	EvoCultiva	This is not very informative or honest.... We are already suffering effects of climate change in the real world. Just look at Miami with it’s day flooding problems. Look at the acidification and heating of the ocean from excess carbon in the atmosphere (which is the reason why a large portion of barrier reef has bleached). Take a look at the increased frequency of hurricane events in the last decade, or the increased drought frequency. The side effect of these events extends past the initial happening, leaving profound and long lasting repercussions. With the increase in global temperature, many plagues have emerged again in the form of diseases (no not Covid, I’m mostly talking about agricultural diseases which affects our food supply chain) and other plagues such as locusts and nematodes. I’m not saying the world is going to end, no serious climate scientist is, however we will face increasingly severe issues if we keep ignoring the problem. <br /><br />Reducing the issue to “more people die from cold” is a straw man argument. It’s below anybody who would consider themselves serious journalists. Try again	UC1v-Ha6swaIMfqfvW6x_B2Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1v-Ha6swaIMfqfvW6x_B2Q	0

Wean off our oil dependency, reduce meat intake as a species (there are plenty of more efficient sources of protein out there that don’t produce greenhouse gasses and aren’t responsible for deforestation), take advantage of agricultural practices that already exist and are in use in places like Holland in order to avoid energy intensive and environmentally damaging food production. We could implement more public transport systems in American cities, we could invest in renovating and repairing our electrical grid and energy infrastructure that is outdated in order to improve our grids efficiency. There’s tons of steps we could be taking that would be not only good for the environment, but could provide jobs, create new industries, and save us from the long term economic costs of climate change which will be high.

Average ice thickness is 2,100 meters. 70% of the earth surface is ocean. So IF it all melts, and IF all of it goes into ocean, the water rises 2100.* 0.03/0.7 = 90 meters. The height of Statue of Liberty is 93 meters. This So Neil Tyson is being generous.<br />John Stossel is wrong and right at the same time. He hand picks various models (model is what it is a model , it has a lot of uncertainty) and mocks that it did not materialize. This is also data manipulation of a kind to re-enforce a certain point (that scientists are full of shit). <br />Yes, the problem is very politicized, he is right. Yes, there are lot of grifters in scientific community (and naturally in business) who benefit from the hype personally . But look at the bright side. If under &quot;Green Tyranny&quot; we get rid of burning fossil fuels to extract energy - a huge win. This old tech. that is out of date and we need to move on. Sustainable energy extraction industry emerges and brings jobs with it , so it is not all doom and gloom and closed traditional power plants.

The World isn&#39;t coming to an end....BUT the geo magnetic pole IS moving, close to 1,000 feet a day, and for the 1st time in 781k years, it is changing. If you research what happens next, after it flips polarization, then you begin to understand why AOC said what she said.....she simply was Parroting what the CIA/FBI told her, and the rest of the Congressmen present during that particular meeting....she should not have said anything. Now you know the REAL reason we have been throwing TRILLIONS of dollars at Musk(Space Sat&#39;s 42,000 sat system)and the rest to build a man made replacement to the Van Allen Belt, which happens to reflect the lethal rays of the Sun. It goes away, the EXPERTS say for up to 1,000 years, so now you know why 37 Billionaires have built bunkers in New Zealand. Your Government is spending money like a drunken sailor, because......they&#39;ll never have to pay it back. The New Green Deal has us replacing virtually all the buildings in N. America, look it up.....I call them mud huts, very energy efficient BUT also radiation proof, if you have to change every industry on Earth, due to a completely FALSE premise....it&#39;s really something else they are doing, and in this case, it&#39;s pay no attention to man behind the curtain.....the poles are going to magnetically shift/flip, and when that really happens, they won&#39;t be able to lie to us anymore. You have 10 years......that&#39;s what the experts say, but they really don&#39;t know, it could be a lot longer than that, but not more than 50-60 years, and THAT assumes the pole stabilizes, something it isn&#39;t doing, it&#39;s accelerating. It has 7,500 miles left to go. NOAA maintains a web site to monitor this, far more important than watching hurricanes. I suggest reading the thesis papers from Geo Physics Doctorial candidates , or Geo Magnetic experts aspiring to become Doctors to confirm the dangers here, and wonder if you will know how violent the World&#39;s geo structure might well be that sad day. Now you know something important. Use that brain!	UC8CaZ8or9b5RWgAEW26aszA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8CaZ8or9b5RWgAEW26aszA	0

They put it that way to show how bad it could get with more small change, but what they really showed was that all of Humankind&#39;s efforts have not created a Venus on this planet. With the output of the Sun going up, it&#39;s possible we have had a tiny effect on the environment. In any event, we already do the simple things, such as reduced auto exhaust, limited use of harmful aerosols, etc. At this point we must judiciously go forward with environmental initiatives once they&#39;ve been analyzed for cost/benefits.

The people that say follow the science ignore the fact that the highest levels of CO2 were found in ice cores dating back to the ice age and that the earths orbit is elliptical among other science facts. A medium volcanic eruption puts more CO2 and other gases into our atmosphere in a few days than man can in decades. They should pass laws banning eruptions and repeal those pesky laws of physics also.	UCjaZSV47cuC7dlmOk6vJQKg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjaZSV47cuC7dlmOk6vJQKg	0

Believe global warming will kill you or not what will effect this planet is when the ocean dissolves a certain % of the co2 we dump into the air every year and the ocean is becoming more acidic every year. It’s already eroding the ocean floor basically melting away all the calcium carbonate ocean creatures use to make shells. If the ocean becomes too acidic it will kill any life within it in certain parts. Once the food chain is disrupted it will create major problems and food shortages in parts of the world where they depend on the ocean to supply them with their meals. That’s the most immediate effect of putting all this co2 into the atmosphere.	UCIW9FyLTQbaV_q6PMWweX1w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIW9FyLTQbaV_q6PMWweX1w	0

The problem isn&#39;t earth getting &quot;too hot.&quot; It&#39;s the implications of damaging earth&#39;s natural heat, moisture, &amp; nutrient exchange. Also the resulting Increasing frequency and intensity of tropical storms, drought and wildfires.

Have you honestly searched and not found the studies pertinent to your inquiry? Of course you haven't. And I won't do your homework for you. As far as "measurable trade-offs" go, are you suggesting that I place a dollar amount on how many people we should strive to feed, house and water in the future, and match that goal with a dollar amount we need to allocate towards solutions that actually make long-term sense? Are you asking me to devise a comprehensive plan to get from where we're at to where we need to be? Because that's not what my comment was about. My comment was simply saying that Stossel's view on the matter fails to accurately represent the real issues at hand. He completely misses the point of being concerned about climate change. It's not about tree-hugging hippies wasting money on feel-good kumbaya bullshit. The issues we're facing are proven threats to our species. If we're smart, we'll find a way to sustain humanity on this planet. And if we're pig-headed and insist that free-market capitalism is the answer to EVERYTHING, then we'll kill ourselves off eventually. There are some of us that would prefer the former option, and some of us that would rather bury our heads in the sand and believe that there's nothing wrong with the way we're doing things, OR that because it's expensive and difficult, that it ought not to be done. God forbid we eat into our profits from exploiting the planet's finite resources in order to invest in a long-term plan.

The gulf of Alaska stocks were wiped out by 2 warm blobs, that came one after the other. Pacific Cod, are a cold water species. They have found out, that the stocks are far diminished in the west Bering Sea, but , numbers are rising in the Northern Bering sea. Why is this not surprising to me? Because one of our best places to fish, has been along the ice edge. The fish are moving ever farther north, to find the water that sustains them. There is only so far to go, until even they, will succumb to warm water. Cold glacial runoff, is what salmon need to mature in the spawning beds. A big reason why every salmon run on the west coast has either collapsed, or is in serious decline.

Climate change may not hurt us now, but if we do not do something, we may do irreversible damage to the planet. Thousands of species of animals are already loosing their habitat, the ocean has already acidified to the point that some mollusks cannot properly build their shells. The effects are real and they are here. Just because it doesn’t harm humans doesn’t mean it doesn’t harm anything else.

In 2004 maybe but now 2020 there is no debate. We know with no doubt that co2 and other green house gasses warm the planet. The switch to green isn&#39;t easy and its not cheap but we need to find an economical sound solution. Not the green new deal. We need to instead of building another dirty coal power plant (ik some run pretty clean but trust me ik ones that really don&#39;t im from wv the literal coal state) we need to look at building maybe a nuclear power plant. We need to develop a new type of battery for electric cars so they go farther and the battery degradation isn&#39;t bad. Its not an easy path to go down. Ik trust me. However it is the right one.

Scientists are telling us that the problem with climate change is the rate by which it is happening. Yes temperatures have been this warm before but it happened very gradually. Same with the C02 content of the atmosphere. The rate at which C02 is being dumped into the atmosphere is very toxic and dangerous and yes we are the cause of that. I watch this channel because he seems to be trying to be unbiased, but I just don’t beleive this guy doesn’t know the actual reasons scientists are warning us. This seemed disingenuous. All the “climate apocalypses” the guy mentioned are all from C02 content in the atmosphere yet he thinks all those things will never happen. Acid rain, raising ocean levels, and losing the ice caps are all still going to happen if something doesn’t change.

Because if this is your reasen, why boy make it 10 or 100 degrees hotter. And look at the dry places in Afrika that years ago where wet. I agree with you on deregulation, the problems of big goverment. And I get why the issue of climate change challenges those ideas so much that you want to deny it. But you don’t deny it, you just say that the consequenses are nonsens, and I think that your wrong there. <br />Sorry for bad English, I al Dutch and a dislect	UCWJ_VrXlM8DaqVmPVJSS9uw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWJ_VrXlM8DaqVmPVJSS9uw	0

UgyCYT0hmdFEHqCM4Nx4AaABAg	0	1	2020-08-29 11:36:50	Book Lover	Ok so this video has so many confusing points. Firstly, comparing how many people die of heat and cold is pointless. Climate change isn’t just global warming, it’s also the reason for stronger hurricanes (because of warmer ocean water) and more frequent extreme weather. Both of those kill people and will cause migration as people move into areas that are safer. With the rising temperature, bees are starting to die which may cause famine. So saying that a heating planet is fine is simplifying the problem of climate change which has a much wider impact. <br /><br />Secondly, saying that there are bigger issues than climate change is also a misunderstanding of the problem. Sure, there are big immediate problems to be addressed but if we don’t address climate change we will soon face even bigger, irreversible problems. There is an article by Time which gathers evidence and shows that we only have about 10 years to stop climate change and that we are already facing its impact. It’s only going to get worse.

The reason for that being is that evidence shows that rising atmospheric carbon dioxide, partly driven by industrial emissions, is boosting forest growth. Satellite data shows an eleven percent growth in global leaf area from 1982 to 2010. Scientists attribute most of this growth to rising atmospheric carbon dioxide. However, there are still a fast forest decline in other countries like Mexico, South America, Africa, South East Asia, etc. The human and animal population is growing in a large scale. What usually follows is that -- the larger increase in human population, the larger and faster industrialization will progress because demand in land and transportation will take place. Where do they get this extra land to create roads, buildings, houses, etc? Agricultural land probably, but that's a double whammy because now your food source supply will decline and at the same time you will be killing agricultural plants which is also a source for OXYGEN. Then their are others who would take advantage of large mass forest areas to build these extra roads, buildings and houses. Many countries still doesn't have laws in place to protect forest and agricultural lands. For now, the supply of OXYGEN is still stable and sustainable. What happens after 50 to 100 years especially that the aggressive worldwide laws to reduce carbon emissions are taking place? Will the remaining plants and trees have enough CO2 and will they be able to convert OXYGEN enough to supply for both human and animal population in the near future?

In order for plants and trees to survive they need sunlight, water and carbon dioxode (CO2). What do plants and trees convert or breath-out? OXYGEN! What do humans and animal need to survive and live besides water and food? That's right! OXYGEN! Everybody is so involved in this CO2 fiasco when we forget that OXYGEN too needs attention. Do we have enough plants and trees to breath-out OXYGEN this days? How many humans and animals are increasing every minute? Do you agree that we are now over populated? If so, do you think we will have enough OXYGEN supplied by planet Earth in the next 50 to 100 years from now? As much as you hate to admit it, we need as much CO2 in order to supply more OXYGEN which is provided by plants and trees. Problem is, plants and trees have been decreasing every year because of illegal logging, forest fires, irresponsible industrialization, deforestation, etc. By the time we find ways of decreasing CO2 emissions we will now have a new problem in OXYGEN supply. Then we say..... plant more trees and pump up more CO2 so we can get more OXYGEN! Funny how things will turn out that way.

But at the same time, we need to be as REALISTIC about it as possible. The environment that we live in is NEVER going to be perfect, at least, not while us humans are here. Plus, the sun, the earth, and all the rest of the planets of our solar system are going to come to an end anyway. Therefore, why worry about it that much?

You&#39;ll note that it has been on a steady downward trend for millions of years, and was approaching the point where it would become hard on plant life. Somehow the planet and life did mostly well even though through nearly all its history it&#39;s had higher levels of CO2.

But I have the impression that you are uneducated. I mean, real science tells us that H + 2O is water? No, water is 2H + O. This is so simple, and you fail even on that level, it's just unbelievable. I am sorry, but it seems you haven't got the faintest idea how the world and nature works and you are just plain ignorant. Asking the question "What is the level of co2 in the atmosphere supposed to be?", is like asking "what is the temperature of water supposed to be?". It's a stupid question, it is what it is. And higher CO2 levels have implications: it gets warmer. And warmer weather has also implications, like for example on crop harvests, water availability, insects etc etc. What part of this do you not understand? You call everything Junk and BS. I have the feeling that you have not read ONE scientific article ever, because either you cannot manage to read a text longer than one page, or you think it's useless because its junk anyway! I wonder where you get your information from. I mean, more "frikkin trees" then ever before? Really? Can you please share your sources with me? What kind of websites are you searching for what you want to read?	UCDxY89lJKjUMolO3f8-wW9Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDxY89lJKjUMolO3f8-wW9Q	1	Ugx5wpcU3HJlMRpLKox4AaABAg	Bart Hillen

The things you mention in your response seem to come straight out of the mouth of Sean Hannity. I agree with you that there is a lot of scare tactics going on when you turn on the TV. You hear doom predictions every day, like the polar bear extinction or Bangladesh under water. And when it turns out to be wrong.....crickets. I get it. However, I hear the same kind of doom scenarios from the other side, like the things you wrote in your response. "The Dems want the US to become like Stalin-Russia, they want to ruin America etc". When THAT turns out to be false (or exaggerated), it's also crickets coming from e.g. Hannity. So it seems the left AND right are both using scare tactics for their own purpose. Myself, I am from The Netherlands, and we do not have left or right wing media. We have only middle of the road politicians, and MSM, who try to inform the people of The Netherlands with accurate information without attacking any political opponents. So maybe I am "ancient" and have "no clue to what's going on", but what makes you think that you do? It all depends on where we get our information from, right? Do you watch Fox, or CNN? I watch both, and come to the conclusion that both are often exaggerating and sometimes lying. Scientists are generally not lying, because they have no use for it. What is the point of doing research, spending years on it, and than afterwards lie about the results? The media (left and right) are the ones PRESENTING the results to the public on TV, and they both give their own spin at it. Don't blame the scientists for that, blame the media!

You say "create a crisis to advance the left wing agenda". What is that agenda? And how would a (global) crisis help this agenda? I am seriously interested in your opinion on this, because I hear and read this argument all the time without anyone actually explaining what this means. Now your questions, first about the 0.03% CO2. If you drop the CO2 level with 25% you'd come to 0.0225% CO2 and that will likely trigger our planet into an new glacial period. How do I know? Well, you only have to look at patterns from the past. Currently we are in an interglacial period, with mild temperatures. The past 700.000 years planet earth has been through 8 glacial cycles. These cycles are driven by the CO2 concentration in the atmospere. In the warmest periods the CO2 level was 0.03% (like now) and in the coldest periods, when earth was mostly covered in ice, the CO2 level was just under 0.02%. So the 0.0225% is quiet close to this level, and would result in massive temperature drops. The second one is about "scientific questions": What do I want the climate to be, and why? Well, there is no answer to these questions, as I don't want the climate to be anything. It is irrelevant what people want, it's about understanding how things work. Look, you have to stop thinking that scientists are claiming the end of the world is near because we burn fossil fuel. Scientists understand the mechanisms that drive our global temperatures and CO2 (and other greenhouse gasses) are the main driver. If we put more CO2 in the atmosphere, the temp goes up. Really simple common sense stuff, my friend. The predictions on the effect of higher temps on our daily life are more extreme weather, more droughts in some parts of the world, more floods in other parts, disrupted ecosystems etc. Not the end of the world, no oranges in Minnesota, but they are temperature related events that eventually will cost us (humans) a lot of money. By reducing the rise of CO2 (and thereby temperature) we can limit these negative effects and continue our lives as we are used to.

Ugx5wpcU3HJlMRpLKox4AaABAg.97uvS5G5ajz98-rpbKDfB5		1	2020-04-28 19:48:54	Bart Hillen	​@Jenn smith Well, your reply is full of typical denialist talking points which are to be found all around the blogosphere, copy pasted time and time again. As I explained earlier, polar bears, certainly photo shopped on posters, do not reflect any published study, it's only misleading and highly emotional global warming propaganda, and I hate it. The IPPC report you mention, I looked it up and this is an opinion piece. Your quote comes from a remark from someone from the United Nations University on the UN Day for Disaster Reduction, 12 October 2005. Definitely not a published study. Nor is Hansens prediction, this comes from an interview with him where he was asked a hypothetical question by a reporter in 1988 on what COULD happen if the CO2 level would double. Hansens answer is totally ripped out of context. Look, I can go on like this, but you clearly don;t see the difference between a peer reviewed article in a respected journal, and a soundbite from a professor. And this is becoming even more clear when I read your next piece: a BASIC scientific question is "Why?". Well firstly, "why" is not relevant, the question would certainly be "How?". Secondly, scientists don't "want" the climate to be anything. Not warm, not cold. They observe, and based on their observations they make a hypothesis to predict certain outcomes. This hypothesis should withstand scrutiny. Scientists are always trying to disprove their theories, and the ones from their peers! They don't try to prove they are right, they try to understand the world we live in. Stubbornly defending a claim which they know is wrong will certainly not help. And finally the CO2, it's not 3% of the atmosphere, it's 0.03%. If it would be 3%, planet earth would be a hothouse. The thing is, when there is a substance in small amounts, does not make it less harmful. A few mg's of arsenic will kill you. When it comes to climate studies, they are not local. Not Minnesota area, not England, not the Northern Hemisphere, it's global.	UCDxY89lJKjUMolO3f8-wW9Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDxY89lJKjUMolO3f8-wW9Q	1	Ugx5wpcU3HJlMRpLKox4AaABAg	Bart Hillen

There is no study that concludes ice bears are going to drown, or NYC will be under water by 1990. These are statements or opinions by people, the likes of Al Gore. If people like to display their opinion in a movie, a column or a blog, that doesn't mean there is any truth in it. Climate scientists have published thousands of peer reviewed studies in the last 100 years and these studies precisely explain the mechanisms that influence the climate. And based on these mechanisms, they made models to predict what happens to the climate in case some factors are changing. These predictions are by no means doom scenarios, do not mention mass extinction, ice bears or other things like that. These are the things you read about in the magazines and blogs. That is the bullshit part. The conclusion that almost all climate scientists agree about, and this is well described in all these studies, is that the global temperature IS rising in an unprecedented rate, and human CO2 output is the main driver for this. That's it. There is nothing polarizing about that. If we just would except this and admit we are making life difficult for ourselves (for our children), we can together work on this. Polarizing figures like Al Gore or John Stossel are certainly NOT helping	UCDxY89lJKjUMolO3f8-wW9Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDxY89lJKjUMolO3f8-wW9Q	1	Ugx5wpcU3HJlMRpLKox4AaABAg	Bart Hillen

Nuclear energy is not nearly as dirty or unsafe as people claim it to be and the risk of a Chernobyl or Fukushima style meltdown is close to non-existent in the USA due to reactor design safeguards. We should also pursue biofuels from photosynthetic algae since that can generate 60% of its own weight in fuels versus 2-3% with corn and soy, while also consuming atmospheric carbon dioxide faster than planting trees.

Moreover, we are not talking about replacing our entire electric generation system...but less than 1/3rd....we need to keep our eye on converting Trucks, buses, cars to electric. .

Fossil fuels release pollutants, solar power requires large plots that negatively impact the environment even if they don't have to cut down a lot of trees to open up the land, even wind, although less harmful than most, does have a negative effect on bird populations and is not helpful where there isn't much wind. I would argue that the effects of a nuclear power plant not operating properly is about as dangerous as many other energy sources operating as they should.

It was collected and documented by Barton Paul Levenson, I quoted Barton as follows below . . "Global Warming Science & Climate Models have successfully predicted steady/increasing WARMING for over 65 YEARS! . See the 1958 1965 AAAS (( the American Association for the Advancement of Science & Presidential Science Advisory Councils Research Reports & Warnings on Global Warming which causes Climate Change.)) These projections would start to be seen 50 years from 1965. ((( 2015 ))) 1. That the globe would WARM! . ((directly counter to the Mini ICE Age myth perpetuated by the Skeptic/Fossil Fuel Industrialists DEEP STATE. ---a mini ice age PREDICTED in the '70s, & again in the 80's, '90's, 2007-2009, 2015 and now in 2020, we will be up to our assets in that mini ice age in 2020)) . 2. about HOW FAST it would warm, . 3. about how much it would warm. . http://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6242/1469 . 4. That the troposphere would warm . 5. The stratosphere would cool. . (( http://hadobs.metoffice.com/hadat/images/update_images/global_upper_air.png )) . (( not one SKEPTIC has offered ANY FULL Scientific Based Explanation for this GLOBAL WARMING SCIENCE PROOF )) . 6. That nighttime temperatures would increase more than daytime temperatures. ----->Nighttime Lows Warming Faster Than Daytime Highs – Does ... praedictix.com/nighttime-lows-warming-faster-than-daytime-highs-does-hot-weather-make-us-d… . (( https://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/beyond-data/climate-change-rule-thumb-cold-things-warming-faster-warm-things )) . 7. That winter temperatures would increase more than summer temperatures. . (( After all of the SUB ZERO temps this year, Wisconsin meteorologists pooled their data and found nite time winter cold temps have WARMED 10 degrees of the last 40 years)) . 8. Polar amplification (greater temperature increase as you move toward the poles). . Arctic amplification | National Snow and Ice Data Center . (( https://nsidc.org/about/monthlyhighlights/2009/09/arctic-amplification )) . 9. That the Arctic would warm faster than the Antarctic. . Arctic melt versus Antarctic freeze: Is Antarctica warming ... https://nsidc.org/.../11/arctic-melt-versus-antarctic-freeze-antarctica-warming-or-not . 10. The magnitude (0.3 K) and duration (two years) of the cooling from the Mt. Pinatubo eruption. . 11. They made a retrodiction for Last Glacial Maximum sea surface temperatures which was inconsistent with the paleo evidence, and better paleo evidence showed the models were right. . 12. They predicted a trend significantly different and differently signed from UAH satellite temperatures, and then a bug was found in the satellite data. . 13. The amount of water vapor feedback due to ENSO. . 14. The response of southern ocean winds to the ozone hole. . 15. The expansion of the Hadley cells. . 16. The poleward movement of storm tracks. . 17. The rising of the tropopause and the effective radiating altitude. . 18. The clear sky super greenhouse effect from increased water vapor in the tropics. . 19. The near constancy of relative humidity on the global average. . 20. That coastal upwelling of ocean water would increase. . -----------> Broecker is probably best known for popularizing the term “global warming” through his 1975 paper . “Climatic Change: Are We on the Brink of a Pronounced Global Warming?” . -----------> "Climate Change" as used today, was first researched & defined by Alexander von Humboldt in 1799, while on a world wide lecture tour in Venezuela.

Watching Climate Change in a window is equivalent to watching sag deformities develop in the glass (a liquid) over half-hundred year intervals. And since we are very near a peak in interglaciation, now is the absolute worst time from a scientific pov to throw in the new anthropogenic factor. The people calling this a science are hacks.

C02 is a greenhouse gas, but is <b>food</b> for the plants and trees. Most people ignore thermal pollution. That car has an internal bonfire that produces heat that has to go somewhere. Same thing for other buildings and associated machines. We seem to have a lot of invisible bonfires burning twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, globally. That&#39;s a <b>LOT</b> of heat, not including what the sun gives us.<br /><br />Sure, personalities and agendas can get in the way of accurate information dissemination, however truth is revealed eventually; even faster with open-minded cooperation.<br /><br /> Pollution is simply an unused resource., so lets use it in a safe way. Permaculture Design Principles seem to be an effective way to handle it. What are your ideas?	UCKG5AYFzFVyXYw9FW8ssESg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKG5AYFzFVyXYw9FW8ssESg	0

As if Wikipedia saying that &quot;Global warming is the mainly human-caused rise of...&quot; makes it a fact. I have no doubt that (some) scientists say that, what I do doubt is the methodologies and the stories written about the work the scientists have done. It&#39;s really easy to take a report, get the wrong main idea about it, or over-play the ideas presented, and then proliferate that into the world as reputable. It&#39;s also really easy to do junk science and then get that nonsense published, and then have that nonsense be the basis for further nonsense. <br /><br /><br />I&#39;m not opposed to &quot;man-made global warming&quot; on ideological grounds, I&#39;m opposed to it on the grounds that I have as yet not seen any information where the topic has been studied from a neutral point of view, and has taken the time to first rule out all the converging environmental factors to say definitively that: A) The planet really is warming, and it&#39;s humans doing most of it. B) This is not a natural planetary cycle. C) Assuming A and B are true, that humans can actually do anything about it without causing massive death and suffering. D) Given A, B, and C, a warmer climate would actually be worse than the one we have now. If any of those things I mentioned are off, or if it turns out that daily termite respiration or some other completely inane reason has a larger effect than everything we could do, then the cure would be far worse than the disease. <br /><br /><br />My intuition tells me that we haven&#39;t yet been able to meet the standard of proof I laid out, and considering what would need to happen if it were true, that standard of proof is not unreasonable. My intuition also tells me that a diffuse problem with no clear cause, where the proposed solutions involve giving world leaders the ability to micro-manage people, centralize control, act as a gateway for winners and losers, and extract wealth from the population at large without the need to contribute anything, creates a huge perverse incentive that we would do right to be extremely wary of, and further increased the likelihood that junk science, propaganda, and political theater will ensue.<br /><br /><br />TL;DR - If this is as big a problem as claimed, there would be no problem deriving clear, easy to explain facts that show it to be undeniable, and the people charged with finding out would make it their top priority to do so.

Nobody likes wasting money on high power bills and expensive gasoline - businesses least of all. Even if there were a climate crisis, the free markets were already chugging, full-steam-ahead, towards solving the problem. I agree that the climate scientists behave more like a religionists than scientists. Some of the predictions they make are just plain insane on their face. The Earth is an incredibly complicated system and there is no possible way to predict what will happen even next week, which is why weather forecasting is so bad. If someone thinks they can predict what such a complex system will do over a large time span, they are either lying or delusional or both.

And finally off the Marshall islands in the south Pacific. They took fully stocked carriers, destroyers, battleships, all loaded as if they were going out to sea, and detonated 3 nukes just above the water. To see what affect would have on the environment. <br />That&#39;s just the US over 300 nukes. Add the other countries that did this for ten straight years.

When I am at work I try to promote logical thinking by presenting steps then asking for interpretation. I have a structural engineering degree and work in canada. I have been up north some and consulted on projects are far north as Alert. This is just me giving some background not telling you to believe me blindly. Sadly the people that proclaim themselves "climate experts" have no science background at all. Here is the discussion I would propose... How much ice is on the antarctic land mass? And how many depressions are on the land mass that would form inland seas? The liberals make it sound like this ice has been there forever and that it is somehow a sign of something terrible if it melts. Do you know what we found in areas where the northern permafrost has melted? Lichens and other biomass. That means that in the past this ground was not frozen and it wasn't under water either. These areas are very nearly at current sea level. Where does the water go when the ice melts? It evaporates out of the ocean. It is carried over land. It rains over land as fresh water. The water seaps into the water table. It then collects in streams. Then lakes and rivers. Then ends up in the oceans again. The amount of water stored in the water table and aquifers is tremendous. The amount of surface water depletion is currently a concern around here. Nearby lakes are down 2 or 3 metres over the last 20 to 30 years (mostly due to man made diversions). So any greater water introduced would have a location to go that would benefit all people. When you see a lake with lower level than normal then that means the water table in the entire area around the lake is also lower. Could melting ice raise the oceans? Yes. But the alarmists think that every drop would splash into the ocean. They dont consider where it would redistribute. These are the same people that 20 years ago said that if the ice melted this much California would be under water and half of the eastern seaboard would be flooded out. The ice melted and the water did raise... a tiny fraction of what they were saying. They never did update their predictions to include the new sea levels and ice that has already melted. They still keep saying the water will raise this many feet. If anything they have increased the number to make it scarier. Most "activists" are doing it to gain followers and "likes". This generates more donations. The more scared they make people the more they feel they need to do something... so they donate more and "like" more. Its a circle. How many times has any climate activist actually reduced their approximation even one side of the doom? If they have never said anything positive that is usually a sign thay they shouldnt be listened to. If they cannot at least say that increased rainfall would help crops grow. Or that their sea level rising estimate has been revised to be slightly lower.	UC5j_mzw7kPQHhCvJbUYxNQg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5j_mzw7kPQHhCvJbUYxNQg	1	Ugx78rTE30bzVlBFjcR4AaABAg	Some Guy

You can do this expirement at home. Melt some ice in water and measure the level before and after.<br /><br />Any documented &quot;rise&quot; in sea levels is a result of the water washing away beaches.

In 1970, NASA launched the IRIS/satellite that Observed & Measured in detail the Escaping Infra-Red THERMAL Low-Energy Radiation spectra between 400 cm-1 to 1600 cm-1. . ( Google:> IRIS-Satellite Research) In 1996, the Japanese Space Agency launched the IMG/satellite which recorded similar observations. . (Google:.> IMG-Satellite Research) . Both sets of data were compared to discern any changes in escaping . infrared thermal radiation over the 26 year period . (Google.> Harries Research Study, 2001). . They found a Dramatic DROP in Escaping (earth cooling) InfraRed THERMAL Radiation at the Precise wavelength bands that greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) & methane (CH4) absorb energy ! While ESCAPING Infra-Red THERMAL Radiation is DECREASING. Green House Gases were INCREASING! (hand in glove) . The change in ESCAPING I.R. THERMAL radiation is consistent with theoretical expectations & Global Warming Science Predictions. . Research & Numerous Studies have found: . -------------------> "direct experimental empirical evidence for a significant increase in the Earth's greenhouse effect"/GLOBAL Warming. . This result has been confirmed by NUMEROUS subsequent Research & Studies using more recent satellite data, Digital Balloon Launches,etc. . The 1970 & 1997 spectra were compared with additional satellite data . from the > NASA AIRS satellite launched in 2003 . ( Google > Griggs Research Study 2004). . This analysis was extended to 2006 . using data from the -----> AURA satellite launched in 2004 . (Google: > Chen 2007 research Study) .

I thought most of us believed that climate change is real, its speed and danger is an unknown territory, and therefore should be treaded on carefully. Also the effects of global warming actually could be seen here, summers are hotter, winters are colder and the typhoons bigger.<br />I&#39;m from Korea btw.

There are NUMEROUS articles that provide proof that agencies such as NASA and NOAA have used forged data. <br /><br />There is a June 29, 1989 article by Peter James Spielman titled: <br /><br /><b>U.N. Predicts Disaster if Global Warming Not Checked</b><br /><br />The article gave the same dire predictions that climate alarmists are vomiting today except their &quot;doomsday&quot; date was the year 2000.  <br />What year is it again? <br /><br />Al Gore himself purchased an 8.9 million dollar ocean-view mansion in 2010.  Guess what?  It&#39;s 2020 and that mansion is still above water.  Never mind that Dopey Al predicted it would be underwater by 2012 at that time.<br /><br />Speculation and warnings of catastrophic climate change are not unprecedented. In 2001 the Guardian noted that some &#39;70&#39;s headlines shouted, &quot;Brace Yourself for Another Ice Age&quot;. In 1971 the journal Science reported on the subsequent cooling effect resulting from a possible eightfold increase from atmospheric aerosol concentrations, &quot;if sustained over a period of several years—is believed to be sufficient to trigger an ice age.&quot;<br /><br />According to 80 graphs published in 58 peer-reviewed scientific papers in the first five months of 2017 alone, catastrophic anthropogenic global warming does not exist. By October 2017, the number of peer-reviewed papers rejecting global warming had increased to 400.<br /><br />Over 31,000 American scientists have signed the petition rejecting global warming.<br /><br />Even the &quot;97% of scientists agree on climate change&quot; is a blatant lie.  It&#39;s actually less than a third. Here is one example: “Ninety-seven percent of scientists agree: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23climate">#climate</a> change is real, man-made and dangerous.” United States President Barack Obama tweeted that in 2013.<br /><br />That &quot;97 percent scientific consensus” Mr. Obama referenced is not a fact. It is a terribly misleading figure. It derives from a survey of peer-reviewed science papers conducted by John Cook, an assistant professor at George Mason University. But only 34 percent of the papers Cook examined took a position on the cause of global warming. He reckoned that 33 percent (97 percent of 34 percent) blamed humans as a cause. By that reckoning, it would be more accurate to claim that one third of scientists say humans are causing climate change, and two thirds of them are not taking a position.<br /><br />However, when University of Delaware Prof. David Legates reexamined Cook’s study, he found that even the 33 percent figure may be inflated. By his assessment, only about 0.3 percent of the abstracts Cook examined dogmatically state that humans cause climate change.<br /><br />In the peer-reviewed Organization Studies, a 2012 survey of 1,077 professional engineers and geoscientists (or earth scientists) showed that 36 percent believed humans are creating a global warming crisis. The large remaining majority, however, were skeptical of this claim. They said they believe changes to the climate are natural, normal Earth cycles (global warming is what brought the world out of the Ice Age, for example)—or that future global warming will not cause a very serious problem.<br /><br />So, somewhere between 0.3 percent and 36 percent of climate scientist believe that climate change is definitely caused by humans. That is hardly a “scientific consensus.&quot;<br /><br />You don&#39;t know that you&#39;ve been lied to, conditioned, and brainwashed because you&#39;ve been lied to, conditioned, and brainwashed.

It reveals efforts by leading climatologists to doctor data, delete information contradictory to their hypotheses, and blacklist scientists who oppose their theories of man-made global warming. More than 1,000 e-mails and documents were released last week after servers of the University of East Anglia’s Climate Research Unit (cru) were hacked and the information was posted on the Internet. Here are some samples from the e-mails:      Doctoring data: I’ve just completed Mike’s Nature trick of adding in the real temps to each series for the last 20 years (i.e. from 1981 onwards) and from 1961 for Keith’s to hide the decline.      Frustration with facts that do not support the global warming theory: The fact is that we can’t account for the lack of warming at the moment and it is a travesty that we can’t. The ceres data published in the August bams ’09 supplement on 2008 shows there should be even more warming: But the data are surely wrong. Our observing system is inadequate.      Destroying evidence: Can you delete any e-mails you may have had with Keith re AR4?Keith will do likewise. He’s not in at the moment—minor family crisis.Can you also e-mail Gene and get him to do the same? I don’t have his new e-mail address.We will be getting Caspar to do likewise.      Blacklisting scientists who disagree: I think we have to stop considering Climate Research as a legitimate peer-reviewed journal. Perhaps we should encourage our colleagues in the climate research community to no longer submit to, or cite papers in, this journal. We would also need to consider what we tell or request of our more reasonable colleagues who currently sit on the editorial board …. What do others think?I will be e-mailing the journal to tell them I’m having nothing more to do with it until they rid themselves of this troublesome editor.It results from this journal having a number of editors. The responsible one for this is a well-known skeptic in NZ." Notice the date of publication. This is aII OLD NEWS, haIfwit.

However, global warming takes into account temperatures over the entire planet, including the oceans. The land area of the U.S. accounts for only 2% of Earth's total surface area. Despite the U.S. sweltering in the 30’s, those years were not especially hot over the rest of the planet. Globally, 1930 temperatures were actually cooler than average for the 20th century. As for Tony Heller, he is not a scientist because he's published no scientific works. But he parades himself as a scientist.Would a real climate scientist post this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaP9n55CZHQ&t=50s	UCsEQ_YTy_xoG-iWXy7hLimg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsEQ_YTy_xoG-iWXy7hLimg	1	Ugx8sbuuk-OhvxkaGIt4AaABAg	Censored Account

According to actual data which has been suppressed by cIimate aIarmists, the 1930's was much hotter. Try some Tony HeIIer for facts. I'd sooner believe that you're the former Egyptian Ieader than the buIIshit vomited by cIimate aIarmists.

Lets also agree than, that the melting of the South Pole will increase water levels if the climate is in fact getting warmer. What will undeniably happen as the sea rise is that millions of people will have to move from their homelands, and we face a new refugee crisis. I don&#39;t believe climate change should be a political polariser, let&#39;s look at the facts from a non-political standpoint. It certainly will become political with a new refugee crisis.

When sea levels rise, we lose land and people have to move inland. When people have to migrate by the masses, populations will become more dense and pollution will become even more concentrated in cities, causing people to become more sick.<br /><br />And you&#39;re right, we don&#39;t have endless money. So we should probably stop subsidizing hundred-billion-dollar oil companies.	UCPJ6UUnXGfb28tHcz-a3fww	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPJ6UUnXGfb28tHcz-a3fww	0

No one will buy their homes and so they'll lose everything and wherever they move they'll likely be homeless and poor which will lead to more crime in those cities. The cities they move to will become overpopulated and pollution will become even more of a problem there. Why not just try to solve the root problem before it gets there?

And that is a real crisis at hand that has been happening for decades that has boosted cancer levels big time! It&#39;s not as important as the fictitious global warming scare so, it&#39;s ignored! Companies like DuPont pays a tiny fine compared to what they make, and it&#39;s hushed up, business as usual. Politicians bet on making more money and getting more political gain off of something false verses something true by the sky is falling tactics. Fear plays a very important role with society when mixed with lies and propaganda spread by the Liberal media! It&#39;s not about doing the right thing for society, when they have nothing to gain from it! I wonder how many politicians has their pockets lined by DuPont, and many others? And, we wonder how politicians get rich when politics is all they&#39;ve ever done?	UCjZBuJVuyCdN4llIS1oCPDA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjZBuJVuyCdN4llIS1oCPDA	0

Are you stockpiling food and water and TP and dog food and buying guns and stocking up on bullets &amp; stuff? Not one time has anyone ever said they are stocking up on anything. Now I have to agree that the climate is warming up,but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s global warming that&#39;s killing the ocean and the salmon and orcas and such. I think it&#39;s most likely pollution causing that. Global warming is being used by the liberals to tax companies and people and also make a bunch of new regulations that do nothing except hamper the economy. Carbon tax would do virtually nothing except line rich people&#39;s pockets. Just like the Lottery. Lottery was originally intended to be spent on education. Instead,Lottery proceeds go in General fund and gets spent on everything else. I just don&#39;t buy it anymore. I been waiting for years for it to warm up around here and it hasn&#39;t. Last 2 summers we only had 3 days that hit 90&#39;s,my tomatoes didn&#39;t even ripen until I picked the green ones and brought them in the house last Sept.

An iceage would by necessity require more energy to heat homes, businesses, hospitals, etc. Warmer temps would allow greater flexibility in growing food, etc. There are few discussions on the big picture which proves it was much warmer just 900 years ago.

The last 20000 years it has been warming. And the last 6000 years it has been cooling. Climate science only wants to see the last 40 years or so, maybe there is very small warming, but it is far from dangerous. Big part of this man-made warming is urban warming or forged statistics.<br />So, am I a denialist now.<br />If you are afraid of warming, just move to Antarctica and start growing bananans.

And no, it didn't take 5000 years. The Younger Dryas bottomed out 12,000 years ago, meaning the warming occured in 2000 years. However, half that occured in just two centuries (or less). That's about 0.5°C per century for 2000 years, and for two or less of those centuries, +2.5°C of warming. You conveniently ignored the Younger Dryas cooling, in which global temperatures fell about 6-10°C in 1500 years, and the Bølling warming in which global temperatures warmed 6°C in about 500 years. You again conveniently ignored the 13-24 D-O events that occured between 10,000 YBP and 130,000 YBP, in which global temperatures warmed as much as 2-7°C in a matter of decades, and then cooling the same amount in typically the scale of centuries. Then we can't ignore the 8k bond event in which global temperatures fell and then rose 2-3°C in about 500 years. And yes, naturally when you measure temperature changes, the smaller the time window the greater the change. Temperatures may change 1°C from century to century, 0.2°C from decade to decade, 0.5°C from year to year, 3°C from season to season, 3°C from week to week, 3°C from day to day, and 1°C from hour to hour. But of course that's making the shift from climate change to weather change, which we can say with certainty that the short a trend is the less likely it is to continue to the future. And the best part, if you refer to OAS data, the temperature from 1930 to 1970 fell as much as it rose from 1970 to 2010.

Coming out of the last Glaciation from 15,000 years ago to 10,000 years ago, EARTH WARMED 5C in that 5000 years... that is a century rate of 0.1 C / 100 years.... (Earth Temps PEAKED around 8,000 years ago...from then on temps had been naturally falling per Earth Milankovitch Cycles...until this abnormal period of warming) 0.1C per century. ------> That is Earth Normal. From 1880 to 1980, the measured rate of warming was 0.85C/100 yrs. THAT is 8 TIMES FASTER than Earth normal. Noted Denier/Skeptic Dr. John Christy had to admit after recalculating all sat. data with data from over 40,000 digital Earth Stations... Earth has been warming 0.14 C Each Decade from 11/1978 thru this day. That is a Century Rate of 1.4 C per century...... WE ARE NOW WARMING 14 times faster than Earth Norm.

If you want stunning look at the 8k event, the late Wisconsinian warming, or at the 13-24 D-O events that occured during the Wisconsinian glaciation.

During the neo glaciation we've had three other major bond events besides our own, the Minoan climate optimum, the Roman Climate Maximum, and the Medieval Warm period, which were induced by many things from cloud cover, to Solar activity, to volcanic activity etc. Acting shocked about yet another bond event like ours occuring is like being shocked every day of the week isn't average. 2. Refer to OAS data, temperature data that is shielded from dampening ocean air shows a far more accurate response from our climate in respects to different forcers. OAS data shows a cooling trend in the southern hemisphere and shows that temperatures today are comparable to 80 years ago. 3. Could you cite a source for scientist in the 1700s predicting warming, and why they predicted warming? It would seem unlikely that they would blame the green house effect considering CO2 wasn't discovered until 1750 and that methane wasn't discovered until 1776.

Today we are at 3.4mm to 4.0mm And Global Warming Science was saying in the 1960s, that we wouldn't see a significant effect from Warming on the sea-level rise until the 2040s. 100 million people live less than a foot or two above sea level...the projected sea-level rise by 2100 is 2 to 4 feet.

So they started killing them by the thousands to make seat covers for the Hummers. It was much colder back then, and the use of all those 100,000 BTU kerosene heaters started warming the Earth. And that's how they know that it's man's fault, because the glaciers started receding quite rapidly soon after. That's when all the really smart people started building castles high on a hill on Martha's Vineyard.

A brief glance at the record extreme temperatures for each state ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state_and_territory_temperature_extremes">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state_and_territory_temperature_extremes</a> ) will reveal that the record high temperatures for almost half of the states occurred almost 100 years ago -- in the 1930&#39;s. A further examination will reveal that only 2 states had record high temperatures in the last 10 years, and only 3 in the last 20 years. How can we have record high temperatures without any records?

Under strict quality control guidelines, all our instrumentation was calibrated and checked against primary standards. &quot;We never based any result on dodgy computer modelling nor words like we expect, we believe, it is envisaged, or we predict....&quot; With our very reputation as a NATA certified lab, we could never give clients results we couldnt repeat or justify. So I have asked this question many times in vain, but please is there any climate change advocates, evangelist or &quot;expert&quot; reading this? <br />If you &quot;believes the science is in&quot; describe an actual study that uses real scientific data, that proves beyond a reasonable doubt, that fossil fuels 3% contribution to the 0.04% of atmospheric CO2 is 1) responsible for climate change 2) that such change is something new in earth&#39;s long climate history 3) how you moved from correlation to causation ruling out about a dozen other unpredictable parameters that can drastically influence climate?<br /><b>Hint:</b> numerous greenhouse experiments have been performed that produce data that prove beyond any doubt, that increasing CO2 by 200-400 ppm have significantly improved plant yields by upto 200%.

The real point is not that the Earth hasn&#39;t been warmer before but that the RATE of Temperature increase has never been so high. This has been going on since the industrial revolution begun and millions of species have/ are going extinct as they can&#39;t adapt fast enough to live in a 2 degree hotter habitat.

And that took centuries of hard work to do. A nuclear winter is possible, but only because nukes would cause wild fires in Urbana areas and wild lands, and even then the effects of a nuclear winter would last a decade at most based on models run by scientist.

Ronald Reagan may have had his array of Soviet jokes, but Trump’s utterly demented surreal asides ultimately win. Such was the case in Trump’s address today to the Boy Scout Jamboree – i.e. a massive collection of children – where he waxed poetic about a rich friend of his who used to have orgies on his yacht. No, seriously. Referring to his mate William Levitt, he suggested to a whole bunch of 12-year-olds that the insanely wealthy developer probably used his superyacht for sex.

High Energy Solar Radiation is transmitted thru Earth's Atmosphere, 'largely nonreactive' to those gases...though some is reflected. . This Energy heats the earth and the atmosphere. ..without the atmosphere, Earth would become an ice planet when sunsets...rendering life-on-earth impossible. . The Earth then emits this warmth as a Lower Energy Heat Emission toward the cold of space. This form of energy ( Infra-Red Thermal Radiation) is highly reactive with atmospheric gases, ((unlike High Energy SOLAR Radiation)) . Scientists around the world Worry about this Current Warming Phenomenon as it's Coinciding with Earth's farthest orbit swing away from the sun. ( we should be COOLING ) . Similarly, Scientists worry because the Northern Hemisphere/Earth's Axis is also tilted away from the Sun ( this too means we should be COOLING ) . Scientists worry that all this Coincides with Earth's wobble, which is conducive to COOLING. Coinciding with a solar cycle which has been decreasing in output a bit, for over 40 Years. ( we should be cooling ) . In fact, Earth Was behaving in a typical way for MANY thousands of years ... This Inter Glacial Warm Period had PEAKED in temperatures roughly 8,000 years ago and WE HAD BEEN COOLING since then, as we have done for millions of years...a natural cycle of coolings with brief warmings. . THAT is an average 100,000-year cycle which is triggered by the Milankovitch Cycles. . You have to question ((( WHY IS IT NOT COOLING ? ))) ((( What's Changed? ))) Detailed Observations and much Scientific discussions/experimentations have gone into WHY Temps are Warming contrary to Earth's most powerful natural cycles. * "....summary of 10 direct, measured lines of empirical evidence that point to human-induced climate change. In some cases, I have added layman's references in addition to the more rigorous citations Burning Fossil Fuels Correlates with Rising CO2. Humans are currently emitting around 30+ billion tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere every year (CDIAC(ornl.gov)). Human Activities produce over 100+ times MORE CO2 than all of the Volcanoes on Earth Combined/year! ( 0.3- billions tons by volcanoes versus 30+ billion tons by mankind.) Of course, it could be a coincidence that CO2 levels & temps are rising so sharply at the same time so let's look at more evidence that we're responsible for the rise in CO2 levels. . The proportion of Carbon-12 is increasing. (a distinct Burning-Fossil-Fuel isotope) When we measure the type of carbon accumulating in the atmosphere, we observe more of the type of carbon that comes from fossil fuels (Manning 2006 (noaa.gov)). How do we know that recent CO<sub>2</sub> increases are due to human activities? (realclimate.org)] . Oxygen Levels Dropping. This is corroborated by measurements of oxygen in the atmosphere. ( at over 150 locations worldwide ) . Oxygen levels are falling in line with the amount of carbon dioxide rising, just as you'd expect from fossil fuel burning which takes oxygen out of the air to create carbon dioxide (Manning 2006 (noaa.gov)). . Coral Also Confirms They're Fossil Carbons. Further independent evidence that humans are raising CO2 levels comes from measurements of carbon found in coral records going back several centuries. These find a recent sharp rise in the type of carbon that comes from fossil fuels ( Pelejero 2005 ( sciencemag.org) ). . More Heat is Being Trapped at the precise CO2's wavelengths ( & nearly 2dz. other gasses ). So we know humans are raising CO2 levels. What's the effect? Multiple Satellites ( multiple nations ) measure less heat actually escaping out to space, at the particular wavelengths that CO2 absorbs heat (and other gasses as well) , thus finding "direct experimental evidence for a significant increase in the Earth's greenhouse effect". . (Harries 2001 (nature.com), (Griggs 2004 (aip.org), (Chen 2007 (eumetsat.eu)). . More Downward Infrared Radiation. . If less heat is escaping to space, > > where is it going? . MUCH of it is Back to the Earth's surface. Surface measurements confirm this, observing more downward infrared radiation (Philipona 2004 (agu.org), (Wang 2009 (agu.org)). . A closer look at the downward radiation finds more heat returning at CO2 wavelengths, leading to the conclusion that "this experimental data should effectively end the argument by skeptics that no experimental evidence exists for the connection between greenhouse gas increases in the atmosphere and global warming." (Evans 2006 (confex.com)). . It's Not the Sun---- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_activity_and_climate#/media/File:Solar_irradiance_and_temperature_1880-2018.jpeg If an increased greenhouse effect is causing global warming, we should see certain patterns in the warming. For example, the planet should warm faster at night than during the day. This is indeed being observed ( Braganza 2004 (sjsu.edu), Alexander 2006 (knmi.nl) ). [Blog explanation: Human Fingerprint on Climate Change: Nights warming faster than days (skepticalscience.com)] https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/07/11/climate/summer-nights-warming-faster-than-days-dangerous.html and the Stratosphere is Cooling Since the Heat Is Being Trapped in the Troposphere. . https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/2013-state-climate-stratospheric-temperature . Another distinctive pattern of greenhouse warming is cooling in the upper atmosphere, otherwise known as the stratosphere. . This is exactly what's happening (Jones 2003 (agu.org)). . The Tropopause is Rising. With the lower atmosphere (the troposphere) warming and the upper atmosphere ( the stratosphere ) cooling, another consequence is the boundary between the troposphere and stratosphere, otherwise known as the tropopause, should rise as a consequence of greenhouse warming. . This has been observed (Santer 2003 (nyu.edu)). . The Ionosphere is Contracting. An even higher layer of the atmosphere, the ionosphere, is expected to cool and contract in response to greenhouse warming. This has been observed by satellites (Laštovi?ka 2006 (cas.cz)). . In addition to the 10 indicators proposed by Skeptical Science, there are many other empirically demonstrated lines of evidence for the rapid warming the earth is undergoing that should also be considered. . Here are two such items. . 11) Species are headed to the poles and/or higher elevations. According to published research in the journal Science from August 2011, species are heading toward the poles and/or higher elevations. (Source: Rapid Range Shifts of Species Associated with High Levels of Climate Warming) (The Lowly Pine Beetle, confined by COLD Temps. for millennia, to Southern Latitudes … is now found routinely north of Fairbanks Alaska and across near Arctic Canada. Canadian Forestry Officials complain that this beetle NOW fells more Lodgepole Pines than Logging & Forest Fires Combined.) . 12) Plants are blooming far earlier each year. NASA research supports this (Source: Decades of Data Show Spring Advancing Faster Than Experiments Suggest) as well as a 2011 the University of California-San Diego study of Arctic blooms of phytoplankton (Source: Researchers discover arctic blooms occurring earlier) . 13) Antarctica has its first invasive species! . 14) Volcanic carbon dioxide emissions helped trigger the Tumultuous Triassic climate change Posted: 14 Apr 2020 09:57 AM PDT A new study finds volcanic activity played a direct role in triggering extreme climate change at the end of the Triassic period 201 million year ago, wiping out almost half of all existing species. Finally, I leave you two excellent data points to consider: Wide Spread Scientific Agreement. (1) Scientific Consensus. No scientific organization of national or international standing opposes the Widespread SHARED UNDERSTANDING (consensus} regarding human-induced effects on climate change. (Source: Scientific opinion on climate change) . For those who may allege conspiracy, consider the sheer number and diversity of the organizations listed here, representing diverse scientific backgrounds from Western and non-Western nations alike. . (Besides, if this were a conspiracy, how did they get plants and animals to collude? For That Matter, how did they get Muslims and Jews and Christians to agree) (2) Independent Analyses and Converted Skeptics: In 2012, a Berkeley physicist completed an independent research project, funded in part by fossil fuel billionaires (the Koch brothers), to evaluate raw global temperature data and come to its own conclusions.

Of the estimated 147 million to 216 million people in harm's way, between 41 million and 63 million live in China. Twelve nations have more than 10 million people living on land at risk from sea-level rise, including China as well as India, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Indonesia and Japan. Bangladesh is especially vulnerable, identified by the U.N. as the country most in danger from rising seas. Once the ocean rises by 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) next century, it will affect 16% of Bangladesh's land area and 15% of its population — that's 22,000 km2 (8,500 mi2) and 17 million people.

Invented by Modern Science, Dr. Michael Mann, Karl Marx or Groucho Marx. . 1799 Alexander von Humboldt studied, worried and postulated that Human Activites / Pollution would CAUSE "CLIMATE CHANGE"! Strip Mining entire mountain tops, Clear Cutting entire Forests, burning Coal/Peat/Wood/Oil, building huge cities which create their own climates . Alexander von Humboldt Coined the Term "Climate Change" in 1799. The First USE of " CLIMATE CHANGE "/ the definition of which is still in use today. . 1799 Thomas Jefferson also penned a paper on observed "climate change" which he stated was probably caused by man...and had many discussions with John Adams on these climate changes. . 1804 Thomas Jefferson(scientist/philospher/politician) On Climate Change/Real Science. -----> “A change in our climate is taking place very surely. Both heat and cold are becoming moderate within the memory of even the middle-aged, and snows are less frequent and less deep.” . 1811 Scientists Tied Warming, Climate Changes directly to Human Activities & Industrialization. . 1824 Jean-Baptiste Fourier calculates that the Earth would be far colder if it lacked an atmosphere. Certainly, "...Tyndall’s equipment, laboratory and experimental results were more sophisticated than Eunice Foote’s, and he is rightly credited with establishing the experimental basis for the greenhouse effect, first suggested by Swiss physicist Horace Bénédict de Saussure in the the 1760s and later developed by French mathematician Joseph Fourier in the 1820s and French physicist Claude Pouillet in 1836..." . 1856 "....a paper entitled “Circumstances affecting the heat of the sun’s rays,” by Eunice Foote. In two brisk pages, Foote’s paper anticipated the revolution in climate science by experimentally demonstrating the effects of the sunlight on certain gases and theorizing how those gases would interact with Earth’s atmosphere for the first time. In a column of the September 1856 issue of Scientific American titled “Scientific Ladies,” Foote is praised for supporting her opinions with “practical experiments.” The writers noted: “this we are happy to say has been done by a lady.” . Foote’s research & paper demonstrated the interactions of the sun’s rays on different gases through a SERIES of experiments...." . ((Variations of those fundamental Experiments are critiqued/taught in nearly every 1st year science course on colleges and Universities around the world.)) . 1896 Svante Arrhenius (1859-1927) was a Swedish scientist that was the first to claim in 1896 that fossil fuel combustion may eventually result in enhanced global warming. . 1931 "Hulburt's own calculations supported Arrhenius's estimate that doubling or halving CO2 would bring something like a 4°C rise or fall of surface temperature, and thus "the carbon dioxide theory of the ice ages... is a possible theory."(11) Hardly anyone noticed this paper. Hulburt was an obscure worker at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, and he published in a journal, the Physical Review, that few meteorologists read." . 1935 Still, Science largely believed: "Fifty times more carbon is dissolved in sea water than in the wispy atmosphere." "Just like the Sea, plants would grow more lush and thus That would Control/Balance CO2 influence on Climate.?? . 1948 It was thought "The a self-regulating mechanisms of the carbon cycle can cope with the present influx of carbon of fossil origin." . 1940s "...Callendar....concluded that over the past hundred years the concentration of the gas (CO2) had increased by about 10%. This rise, Callendar asserted, could explain the observed warming. . 1952 "...Digital computers were now at hand for such calculations. The theoretical physicist Lewis D. Kaplan decided it was worth taking some time away from what seemed like more important matters to grind through extensive numerical computations. In 1952, he showed that in the upper atmosphere, adding more CO2 must change the balance of radiation...." . 1958 and again in 1965 AAAS and the president's Science Advisers presented Current Research & Warning about centuries of Industrial Dumping of Toxic Waste Products into our atmosphere, leading to threatening Climate Changes from Global Warming. . Broecker is probably best-known for popularizing the term “global warming” through his 1975 paper “Climatic Change: Are We on the Brink of a Pronounced Global Warming?” in which he predicted that emissions of carbon dioxide would raise global temperatures significantly in the 21st century. This is now seen as prophetic, but at the time, Dr. Broecker was an outlier.

Alexander von Humboldt Coined the Term "Climate Change" in 1799. The First USE of " CLIMATE CHANGE "/ the definition of which is still in use today. . 1799 Thomas Jefferson also penned a paper on observed "climate change" which he stated was probably caused by man...and had many discussions with John Adams on these climate changes. . 1804 Thomas Jefferson(scientist/philosopher/politician) On Climate Change/Real Science. -----> “A change in our climate is taking place very surely. Both heat and cold are becoming moderate within the memory of even the middle-aged, and snows are less frequent and less deep.” . 1811 Scientists Tied Warming, Climate Changes directly to Human Activities & Industrialization. . 1824 Jean-Baptiste Fourier calculates that the Earth would be far colder if it lacked an atmosphere. Certainly, "...Tyndall’s equipment, laboratory and experimental results were more sophisticated than Eunice Foote’s, and he is rightly credited with establishing the experimental basis for the greenhouse effect, first suggested by Swiss physicist Horace Bénédict de Saussure in the 1760s and later developed by French mathematician Joseph Fourier in the 1820s and French physicist Claude Pouillet in 1836..." . 1856 "....a paper entitled “Circumstances affecting the heat of the sun’s rays,” by Eunice Foote. In two brisk pages, Foote’s paper anticipated the revolution in climate science by experimentally demonstrating the effects of the sunlight on certain gases and theorizing how those gases would interact with Earth’s atmosphere for the first time. In a column of the September 1856 issue of Scientific American titled “Scientific Ladies,” Foote is praised for supporting her opinions with “practical experiments.” The writers noted: “this we are happy to say has been done by a lady.” . Foote’s research & paper demonstrated the interactions of the sun’s rays on different gases through a SERIES of experiments...." . ((Variations of those fundamental Experiments are critiqued/taught in nearly every 1st-year science course on colleges and universities around the world.)) . 1896 Svante Arrhenius (1859-1927) was a Swedish scientist that was the first to claim in 1896 that fossil fuel combustion may eventually result in enhanced global warming. . 1931 "Hulburt's own calculations supported Arrhenius's estimate that doubling or halving CO2 would bring something like a 4°C rise or fall of surface temperature, and thus "the carbon dioxide theory of the ice ages... is a possible theory."(11) Hardly anyone noticed this paper. Hulburt was an obscure worker at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, and he published in a journal, the Physical Review, that few meteorologists read." . 1935 Still, Science largely believed: "Fifty times more carbon is dissolved in seawater than in the wispy atmosphere." "Just like the Sea, plants would grow more lush and thus That would Control/Balance CO2 influence on Climate.?? . 1948 It was thought "The a self-regulating mechanisms of the carbon cycle can cope with the present influx of carbon of fossil origin." . The 1940s "...Callendar....concluded that over the past hundred years the concentration of the gas (CO2) had increased by about 10%. This rise, Callendar asserted, could explain the observed warming. . 1952 "...Digital computers were now at hand for such calculations. The theoretical physicist Lewis D. Kaplan decided it was worth taking some time away from what seemed like more important matters to grind through extensive numerical computations. In 1952, he showed that in the upper atmosphere, adding more CO2 must change the balance of radiation...." . 1958 and again in 1965 AAAS and the president's Science Advisers presented Current Research & Warning about centuries of Industrial Dumping of Toxic Waste Products into our atmosphere, leading to threatening Climate Changes from Global Warming. . Broecker is probably best known for popularizing the term “global warming” through his 1975 paper “Climatic Change: Are We on the Brink of a Pronounced Global Warming?” in which he predicted that emissions of carbon dioxide would raise global temperatures significantly in the 21st century. This is now seen as prophetic, but at the time, Dr. Broecker was an outlier.

I mean, it's no coincidence that damn near every politician that spouts off about climate change and/or introduces legislation is set up to receive a big chunk of change because of it. It's also pretty telling that the big names of climate change preachers that pontificate to us plebs about our *_"carbon footprint"_* tour the globe in private jets, go yachting with middle-eastern oil moguls, take *RIDICULOUSLY* unnecessary helicopter rides, use private jets to pick up clothing and one or two people, etc. Believe what you want but, it's not as cut and dry as you seem to think it is.

Thomas Jefferson & John Adams discussed it from 1799 thru 1804. When it was Demonstrated & accepted that GLOBAL WARMING Was Causing that CLIMATE CHANGE...in the late 1800s, then it was referred to as GLOBAL WARMING. It was a REPUBLICAN P.R. Man than pushed and financed the USE OF 'CLIMATE CHANGE' cause he thought it would be HARDER for Democrats to make that sound BAD.....even though HE admitted it was bad. A PURE POLITICAL LIE!

That the recent steady global warming trend has a fundamental effect, increased atmospheric moisture which has one way to go... down in several forms. It&#39;s too flippant interchanges like this that delay a public supported serious investigation into causes and effects to determine whether and what is best to do if man is a significant cause of a problem.

That the planet is going through it&#39;s natural cycles of hot and cold periods . Best humanity can do is adapt to the changes. <br />People often site the melting ice as a bad sign. Guess what, the only reason we have all this surface ice in the first place is that we&#39;re currently in a warmer period of the current ice age. When the planet does warm up and goes back to a more normal state most of the surface ice will disappear including the poles.<br />Lastly the planet will warm up ,but nothing can ever be done about that because the output from the sun is increasing.

A city of 5 million people was covered in thick smoke for weeks, imposing huge burdens on healthcare and hundreds of millions in lost man hours. The fires started in winter and are expected to burn through to next winter, if the rains come. Meanwhile, elsewhere in the country severe storms have caused flooding and have washed the ash and other debris from previously fire-affected areas into dams and streams killing fish and making the water unusable. If that weren’t enough sustained heatwaves have pushed temperatures into the mid 40C (115F) in our large cities causing deaths from heat exhaustion in humans and animals. All this was predicted in 2008 in a report to government by Ross Garnaut, an economist, charged with the responsibility of looking at the economic risks climate change might pose to the nation. And so it came to pass, lost revenue from industry, tourism; small businesses wiped out; reconstruction costs to government and insurance companies resulting in either skyrocketing premiums or refusal to insure; strain on the healthcare system (the current corona virus epidemic is just adding to that burden); tainted water, disruption to transportation as roads, bridges and other transport infrastructure has to be rebuilt. The cost to our nation from inaction on climate change as been in the billions so far and shows no signs of abating. It makes no economic sense to prop up one industry at the expense of every other. Climate change deniers have no moral high ground here, the costs of doing nothing are horrendous and this is only the beginning.

Ask yourself this one question, and know Climate Change is a fraud for the purpose of profits. WHEN is the last time you heard ANY POLITICIAN, government, banking board, or talking public head demand the immediate BANNING of Real Estate Loans in low-lying coastal areas that are less than 50-feet above sea level? This is the land that MOST ASSUREDLY (by ALL of their Climate Change Models) will be inundated by sea water rise, when the ice caps melt. This would encompass 60% of the WORLD&#39;S highest-density population areas...Tokyo, NYC, LA, Boston, Sydney, London, etc. - and if they won&#39;t IMMEDIATELY BAN real estate purchase loans (20-year and longer) in these areas...what does that actually say about the reality of sea level rise? Why did former President Obama JUST BUY a house on the Atlantic Coast (for $10-million) in Martha&#39;s Vineyard...if (with his INSIDER KNOWLEDGE) he should have KNOWN the seas would rise in 20-years and wipe his house out?!

That is wrong. . Study lead author Benjamin Santer, an atmospheric scientist at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory said in a statement. . “We do!” The general mechanism is quite well understood! . We burn carbon-based fossil fuels. This process releases ancient stored carbon dioxide (and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere), which Resists, Traps & Redirects IR heat (which is attempting to escape to the cold of Space as a cooling effect for earth). There’s absolutely no doubt that the planet’s climate is getting hotter — decades’ worth of satellite & ground data clearly show . (Alexander von Humboldt coined the term and defined ' CLIMATE CHANGE ' in 1799) (Thomas Jefferson & John Adams discussed this changing climate from 1799 to 1804) (Science established human activities were causing these Global Climate Changes in 1811) . There’s Now Overwhelming evidence that points to human activity as the main culprit. While there are natural factors that can cause an equal and even greater impact, human activity is essentially a smoking gun here: the evidence indicates that all of this current global warming is caused by humans. . In this latest study, scientists carried out a statistical analysis of satellite climate data, identifying the anthropogenic fingerprints in climate change. . The analysis showed that humans are causing climate change to a confidence level of 5 sigma, the so-called gold standard of statistics — which translates a 99.9999% certainty. . In other words, there’s only a one-in-a-million chance that the pattern of atmospheric heating is not the result of human activity. . Science doesn’t really ever eliminate uncertainty — it just reduces it, and when the uncertainty reaches very low levels, then that’s essentially a scientific certainty. This isn’t the first study to strongly conclude that humans are causing climate change ==================================================================	UCt9UyYrv76HIRb_2mKix47g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt9UyYrv76HIRb_2mKix47g	1	UgwGn4FtKJZU7k7Bf214AaABAg	Bob Bremner

Taxes are regularly being cut in britian and the USA for the rich and cooperations. Let not forget the people who work for the government pay tax. The conservative government is mostly made up of the super rich elite. They been cutting their own tax like they do everytime they are in power, the people who fund the conservatives 43 are billionares they don't want to pay tax and if taxes were to rise the conservatives will lose political doners. As for the cooperations many conservatives have shares in big cooperations and many company owners and share holders are doners. In the election the conservatives had very few plans for climate change. They said they were going to ban fracking and have recently gone back on this decision. Boris Johnson the prime minister was missing from a debate on climate change. Raising taxes doesn't necessarily benefit the people working in the government its certainly not.the conservative way. If taxes are raised its usually for a reason, like the planet being fucked and us needing to do somthing about it.

By regulating the Earth’s cloud cover, the Sun can turn the temperature up and down. ... As the Sun’s magnetism doubled in strength during the 20th century, this natural mechanism may be responsible for a large part of global warming seen then."

There are worse pollutants to be addressed.	UCc8IsPueVlx271atj8E4tYA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc8IsPueVlx271atj8E4tYA	0

If a lake evaporates faster then it can replenish we&#39;ll have some problems. Such as aquatic life will die as there is less area to live and less plants can grow. So if you fish on that lake they&#39;ll be less fish, so less food, and economically less money.	UC9KkxUq1CU56KqFUJtLouOQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9KkxUq1CU56KqFUJtLouOQ	0

The original survey of IPCC that claims to have a 97% consensus was bassed on 79 scientists who wrote articles about man-made global warming. Whilst IPCC was doing the survey, two scientists opted out, saying it was all a hoax. 77/79 equals 97%. In any event, that was a tiny, skewed sample. <a href="http://www.petitionproject.org/">http://www.petitionproject.org/</a>	UCq4IHb1F3eZn_O6-Dy8Pd3A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq4IHb1F3eZn_O6-Dy8Pd3A	0

I know several of these sites were engulfed by urbanization. Urban areas have more heat-producing sources that rural areas. There are buildings, automobiles, trucks, hard roads, etc. Of course those sites will register higher temperatures. Carbon in the atmosphere will not act as a heat diode. They have never provided an experiment to prove that hypothesis. Show me the proof or shut up.	UCI6c9jRpWAipKDhD3GUBzlg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI6c9jRpWAipKDhD3GUBzlg	0

Research in truth does not support this fear induced climate, global warming lie they&#39;re trying to shove down our throats not to mention the money they&#39;re making on it, and it&#39;s about control. Fear to control. One way to bring in this global government they want. I&#39;m going to trust in my God, not man. I do know the Lord Jesus WILL bring in his earthly Kingdom when the time for it comes and no one will prevent it. This Earth will be going horrible changes but it has nothing to do with global warming. It will be God&#39;s judgment on non repentant mankind during the 7 year tribulation. Government doesn&#39;t really tell the truth cause the don&#39;t know the truth. God&#39;s Word however is truth. The knowledge is there, the future of this planet is all in the Word of God.

(Lot of pseudoscience out there.) I have a 'proper' Scientific background, myself - that of Physics and Mathematics - but personally more of an Empiricist these days. Now the reason I don't find your argument very persuasive is that you start with an argument from authority (a form of logical fallacy) and then conclude with an easily refuted assertion - if there is but a single fact in there, your whole dismissive argument is invalidated... So maybe go away and learn something about Critical Thinking? Now, in relation to the point _I think_ you are trying to make, from the prehistorical records, the climate has been changing since before simians roamed the Earth... So, if by "Climate Change", you mean "Man-made Climate Change", yes, human beings have an effect on the climate, in the same way butterflies' wings do. It's really only a matter of scale. You remember George Box's famous quip: "All models are wrong... but some are useful"? The Climate "Science" models might be great at interpolation but they have not proven to be very good at extrapolation... Which is what they would need to be, were we to base the whole of human kind's Governance and decision-making upon them.

Not only does he not include more than a trace amount of actual science in his video, but he cynically trots out a bunch of tropes and &quot;talking points&quot; that have been discredited most thoroughly by actually looking at the evidence instead of just screaming wildly about &quot;leftists&quot; (a vague, meaningless term associated with communism in the mindset of many older USA citizens, who lived through the hysterical age of McCarthyism). Let&#39;s take a look at a couple: 1) Al Gore: this man is a politician, not a scientist. Moreover, he is a MORON - in his films he got nearly everything wrong, and he&#39;s done more harm to the cause of REAL climate science than any the entire industrial-Republican complex. 2) &quot;Climategate&quot;. Anyone who actually read more than a few quote-mined sound bites as in &quot;hide the decline&quot;, lol) from these emails, knows that nothing at all nefarious or dishonest was indicated by ANY of the thousands of mostly private emails stolen from climate researchers. The matter was investigated to death by dozens of organizations worldwide, and the shrill claims by cynical folks grasping at straws to try and discredit the science behind our current understanding of climate change, were shown conclusively to be utterly false - in most cases, deliberate lies or willful ignorance at best. 3) the 97% thing: what the surveys actually show (and yes, almost everybody gets this wrong, even those who should know better) is that 97%+ of scientists ACTIVELY RESEARCHING CLIMATE-RELATED MATTERS, are on board with the notion that a) incredibly rapid warming is indeed taking place (mostly since 1970) on a global scale, and b) human activity is directly or indirectly (as in deforestation) responsible for most of this rapid warming. Now, if 97% of people in a given field are in agreement on something (in this case, the field of climate science), then it&#39;s difficult to say they are involved in a conspiracy. Scientists are a hard-nosed, skeptical bunch not given to herd mentality: the way science normally progresses is by proving other scientists to be wrong. 4) The &quot;science is all about money&quot; meme is total, absolute nonsense: scientists on the whole are very intelligent people. They could make FAR more money by going into the fields of business, industry or finance, than they could ever make by pursuing a career path in the sciences. People choose science as their profession not for monetary gains (science is NOT a lucrative business, unless you are researching nuclear weapons or working for pharmaceutical or oil companies: Mr. Stossel puts up a newsclip showing an EPA representative asking for a billion dollars - this is PEANUTS when it comes to the USA government, which spends almost a TRILLION dollars on &quot;defense&quot; - related categories. 5) The part where he attacks the clean energy manufacturers for receiving government subsidies is colossally hypocritical: oil and gas companies receive IMMENSE subsidies and tax breaks from government: an estimated half a trillion dollars a year worldwide - many many times the amount of taxpayer&#39;s money that is spent for clean energy development and encouragement. I could go on and on - bottom line is that 97% of what he presents here (and elsewhere in his right-wing rantings) is pure bunk.

""ominous signs"" that ""the Earth's climate seems to be cooling down" and ""climatologists are almost unanimous that the trend will continue for the rest of the century". Newsweek even used the"tipping point"argument in that article. This alarmist language is still used for our current "crisis". And just like today fossil fuels were the culprit. It wasn't until 2006 did Newsweek issue a retraction.

That is why they focus more of their time, attention, and money on global warming, rather than on providing clean water to the underprivileged masses of the earth. I can hear their Scrooge-like screeching now: &quot;Better to throw all the money at global warming and decrease the world surplus population!&quot; Hundreds of millions died in the last century due to the proliferation of socialism. And now the left screams for socialism. Noticing a pattern, people? That the left want to destroy more lives is not some conspiracy theory I&#39;m presenting here.

Are there millions of trees in a car changing all that CO2 in O2. No. but we do have trillions and trillions of trees doing just that on the earth. Co2 is food for plants.

CO2 has no such effect, because the three biggest drivers of climate change are:<br />1) The sunspot activity on the sun, which dictates how much UV and microwave radiation Earth receives<br />2) The Milankovitch Cycles, which determine, coupled with axial tilt, use Earth&#39;s distance from the sun to correlate temperature data<br />3) Earth&#39;s EM field, which determines how much solar radiation reaches Earth&#39;s surface	UCIsTP6FRm3P9JQAc228Cbbw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIsTP6FRm3P9JQAc228Cbbw	0

But if me and the other dumdums missed something, feel free to spell it out for us. Seems to me like you were just pandering!<br /><br /><br />And of course you had to mention climate-gate, something that would at most be superficially relevant had you actually done any research on it. Judith Curry should have known better, and the fact that the &quot;scandal&quot; eroded her confidence in potentially catastrophic anthropogenic warming raises more questions than it answers. Nothing but hot air! I&#39;d love to hear it in case I&#39;m wrong, so if you&#39;ve actually done some substantive coverage I&#39;d love to hear.<br /><br /><br />Basically all you&#39;ve done is provide a quarry of lazy inferences coupled with an ample amount of generalizations.

That sure went into the toilet along with that year 2000 ICE AGE they came up with a decade later . I remember that one quite well as it was my generations Chicken Little moment. It had a bit of personal credibility as the US NE Region got 2 years of the worst blizzards on record, 1977-78. I did see snowbank up to the power lines. <br /> There was also the great Denver Blizzard of 1982-3 and I lived them both. Pretty nasty and people really did die getting their mail or of CO poisoning heating their homes any way they could. A couple suffocated while stuck under an interstate underpass on I-70. Yes both sucked but they went away again. If you just took common sense steps everyone was ok in the end. Yet when you read up on even recent Mid 19 Century blizzards they were nothing more than typical. In the end of course we had nothing close to an ice age , pure nonsense. <br /> Here’s another phony hoax though non weather related. Back in the early 1990s we started selling large quantities of softwood overseas, mainly China I recall. Lions n tigers n bears oh my the cry went up. A big spike in hurricane damage and NAFTA happened as well. We we’re going to run out of softwood lumber again by the early 2000s. Oh and prices spiked on these things. A 2x 4 cost around $3 locally , oh my. Gee, and they are about that price 20 years later and the forests have done as they always did,🤔. GREW BACK! Of course in 2020 there’s no shortage whatsoever. <br /> Theres been many other scares and shortages and they all have one thing in common. It’s 🤥making hay for some industry , group or political aim. Big Education is as guilty of greed as any industry. The difference is they’re farming grants and industry / government 💰💰💰instead of really doing anything practical. It’s all about remaining relevant, “”look at me daddy, LOOK AT MEEEEEEEE”...........and while you’re at it keep the 💰coming. I’m sure many brainwashed millennials and educators will see this and howl in rage like Greta . I’ll just laugh at them and shake my head at people so highly educated yet so easily distracted. As for their cry for electric cars and mass transit I hate to disappoint them. We are going to get there anyways, just not next week or year, just give it time not activism.

So you should do some research on your own and skip the loudest promoters of this bunk and look at the true data from all these years.  Rising seas is a perfect example of this...ever port in the world keeps tidal data and it shows the sea rising at the same rate for the last 185 years.  Last year and this one are no exception...same every year!  It is all about power...nothing to do with the planet which goes through natural changes and we as humans have had very little impact on the changes.  The Truth shall set you free.

Global temps are now being faked for the sake of the myth they are pushing. The facts are out there...people just need to go get them and know they are being given BS data.  So you are either a liar...or you just have been lied to and have bought it hook line and sinker. The hard facts show no Global Warming. No melting of the artic glaciers. And rapid increase in the sea level rise.  It is and has been a constant rise since records started.  The facts will set you and your mind free.  Avoid any data that the Government puts out and also NASA and NOOA.  They are committing fraud and also changing Data. Why?? Because the truth does NOT show global warming.  And just for the facts CO2 is not a bad thing.  And CO2 has nothing to do with hotter temps. Real science is a bitch if you are a believer in this crap.	UCgL9ZC0TTKv3qkIWZQJKMyg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgL9ZC0TTKv3qkIWZQJKMyg	1	Ugw8ErJGGCEbq3bHSYp4AaABAg	raythackston1960

Spend pennies on the dollar to make more US dollars via paper, digital or significantly debased currency, without any backing to limit it, other than how much the people and governments decide we/they don&#39;t want that currency over other money that has clearer, more tangible value. Sure, it&#39;ll end for the US eventually, when we or a majority of our allies and enemies get our definitions of money and reserve currency untangled someday that&#39;s likely very far into the future, but that won&#39;t happen nearly as fast as many disasters caused by other things the US could use it&#39;s &quot;money&quot; to solve in the meantime. It isn&#39;t an either or type of situation. We just need to elect people who feel like they have the time to get more than a few things done when given a couple years to do so, and come to some sort of agreement or compromise with a majority of others on the issues.

That's generally my response to having something repeatedly thrown in my face for years on end. Ironically, the so-called "science" of every leftwing obsession is inconclusive, at best, and a lie off a forked tongue, at worst. The raw, unbiased, uninvested science of basically everything from abnormal sexual disorders to economic policies says that the narrative's version of said sciences is bullshit, and climate change is no different. While we could certainly afford to not be such slobs as a species, the end of the world isn't even a little black rain cloud on the horizon. At least, not as a result of global warming... Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to convince you of anything. I gave up on that kind of thing, a long time ago. Nobody can force you to squint and read between the lines. Hopefully, you'll figure it out yourself, though.	UCtycyiUepzqTdGFdqPY-tLw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtycyiUepzqTdGFdqPY-tLw	1	UgysbvCtquENHmlkRWx4AaABAg	Mc Devious

Please don&#39;t mix them up.<br /><br />Hello dumbfuck soybois and soygurrls.....<br />if you really want to contribute urgently to the well being of this beautiful planet the best thing to do is remove your presence from the planet. It doesn&#39;t really matter how much fun you&#39;re currently having being alive you just have to get off the planet.<br />If this selflessness was actually practiced by the dumbfuck masses like you just think how much the planet would benefit. I don&#39;t understand what&#39;s holding up you guys from doing the right thing instead of preaching and screetching and naked street dancing. The more you hold up traffic the larger your <br />carbon footprint. <br />De existing is the  solution.<br />Go for it. Just do it. Be woke. <br />Drink some more <br />Woke O&#39;Cola. ....Go woke..... <br />Get out woke.<br />Even if humans had not evolved all this climate would still be changing like normal planetary changes. <br />The problem is the climate change activists want everyone to live like mahatma Gandhi but they themselves don&#39;t want to. Like the co founder of that Extinction rebellion said herself it&#39;s not about her lifestyle changing it&#39;s about ours changing. Sure. <br />It was a fantastic slip. <br />Con people trying to mass move a false scare. You can&#39;t change the planet climate. Ask any Red Indian witchdoctor still dancingand prancing around a fire trying bullshit stuff to try and bullshit <br />Big Chief Twodogsfuckingcasuallyinpublic.<br />And if water is onto your property you&#39;ve not planned your dwelling right. Location is everything....for sometime. When the planet&#39;s automatic movements come to remind you of your errors you got to move. Weather and climate never stop or can ever be stopped or changed. Men , and women more so are prone to pipe dreams. Man is a migratory animal. <br />If little Gretastupid can cross oceans why can&#39;t others ? <br />Al Gone shouted lies and went....<br />Greta today is a front for the climate tax lobby and a great way to bunk school. Which child wouldn&#39;t say anything to get a holiday ? <br />Climate change is one big con.<br />What we need is environment repair and that is happening naturally. <br />Once the population goes down drastically humans will stabilise at one billion. Then according to real social scientists like James Lovelock the planet will be sustainable. <br />The planet doesn&#39;t have a climate problem....the problem is human population and what to do with the excess baggage that is weighing humanity down like a stinky over filled diaper. There is a solution but its unthinkable because of political correctness. And that&#39;s our civilisation&#39;s downfall. <br />As we speak.<br />The future is always unwritten. <br />Scare mongering is a current fad....first Al Gone...now some sixteen year old child with the mental capacity of an eight year old .....next they might send a premie to the United Nations....and all the dumbfucks will again applaud.....appalling.<br />Rubbing shoulders in the age of atomic and automatic weapons is a natural way to keep the population down. Nature doesn&#39;t care for political correctness it seems.<br /><br />Thank you.	UCIFOo4AVQkh9-sXwKIJbeTw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIFOo4AVQkh9-sXwKIJbeTw	0

However, there is no cooling in site, it will keep on warming little by little. Deserts will grow, land will shrink. No one ever talks about the acidifying oceans as a result. When you kill all the coral and food networks in the oceans, you&#39;re killing half of the worlds oxygen supply. In timescales of 400-1000 years it will be a big struggle for humanity with low oxygen, and much less land to live on.

UgzjrVj_jLrg5DfqfH14AaABAg	0	0	2019-11-07 22:55:36	Jason Melton	According to the Vostok Ice Core Records, CO2 level changes have followed Earth&#39;s overall temperature changes at an 800 year lag for the last 800,000 years. That means that our current CO2 levels are the result of Earth&#39;s overall temperature 800 years ago. World leaders have convinced their dependents that this works in the reverse order, relatively quickly, and that we are to blame, so that they can tax us out of a false shared guilt in order to be able to afford to &quot;fight&quot; climate change, an unstoppable natural cycle. The following is the source of this information:<br /><br />Historical Carbon Dioxide Record from the Vostok Ice Core<br /><br />Investigators<br />J.-M. Barnola, D. Raynaud, C. Lorius<br />Laboratoire de Glaciologie et de Géophysique de l&#39;Environnement,<br />CNRS, BP96,<br />38402 Saint Martin d&#39;Heres Cedex, France<br /><br />N.I. Barkov<br />Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute,<br />Beringa Street 38, 199397,<br />St. Petersburg, Russia<br /><br />Period of Record<br />417,160 - 2,342 years BP<br /><br />Methods<br />In January 1998, the collaborative ice-drilling project between Russia, the United States, and France at the Russian Vostok station in East Antarctica yielded the deepest ice core ever recovered, reaching a depth of 3,623 m (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Ice cores are unique with their entrapped air inclusions enabling direct records of past changes in atmospheric trace-gas composition. Preliminary data indicate the Vostok ice-core record extends through four climate cycles, with ice slightly older than 400 kyr (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Because air bubbles do not close at the surface of the ice sheet but only near the firn-ice transition (that is, at ~90 m below the surface at Vostok), the air extracted from the ice is younger than the surrounding ice (Barnola et al. 1991). Using semiempirical models of densification applied to past Vostok climate conditions, Barnola et al. (1991) reported that the age difference between air and ice may be ~6000 years during the coldest periods instead of ~4000 years, as previously assumed. Ice samples were cut with a bandsaw in a cold room (at about -15°C) as close as possible to the center of the core in order to avoid surface contamination (Barnola et al. 1983). Gas extraction and measurements were performed with the &quot;Grenoble analytical setup,&quot; which involved crushing the ice sample (~40 g) under vacuum in a stainless-steel container without melting it, expanding the gas released during the crushing in a pre-evacuated sampling loop, and analyzing the CO2 concentrations by gas chromatography (Barnola et al. 1983). The analytical system, except for the stainless-steel container in which the ice was crushed, was calibrated for each ice sample measurement with a standard mixture of CO2 in nitrogen and oxygen. For further details on the experimental procedures and the dating of the successive ice layers at Vostok, see Barnola et al. (1987, 1991), Lorius et al. (1985), and Petit et al. (1999).<br /><br />Trends<br />There is a close correlation between Antarctic temperature and atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (Barnola et al. 1987). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows that the main trends of CO2 are similar for each glacial cycle. Major transitions from the lowest to the highest values are associated with glacial-interglacial transitions. During these transitions, the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 rises from 180 to 280-300 ppmv (Petit et al. 1999). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows the present-day levels of CO2 are unprecedented during the past 420 kyr. Pre-industrial Holocene levels (~280 ppmv) are found during all interglacials, with the highest values (~300 ppmv) found approximately 323 kyr BP. When the Vostok ice core data were compared with other ice core data (Delmas et al. 1980; Neftel et al. 1982) for the past 30,000 - 40,000 years, good agreement was found between the records: all show low CO2 values [~200 parts per million by volume (ppmv)] during the Last Glacial Maximum and increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations associated with the glacial-Holocene transition. According to Barnola et al. (1991) and Petit et al. (1999) these measurements indicate that, at the beginning of the deglaciations, the CO2 increase either was in phase or lagged by less than ~1000 years with respect to the Antarctic temperature, whereas it clearly lagged behind the temperature at the onset of the glaciations.<br /><br />References<br />Barnola, J.-M., D.

FACTS.. the earth has gone up and down temp wise various degrees at various times. Many factors and man is a nothing factor, the poles are moving FACT, plate tectonics, heres the science guys through the loss of inertia we get dielectric acceleration, dielectric field, when you have dielectric acceleration towards a null point in counterspace and factoring in plate tectonics, solar radiation, all equates to earth changing, poles moving, dielectric field entanglement or reversal , why did nasa look for glass like rocks on the moon, they were looking for evidence we already have here on earth showing solar cataclysmic events from our sun and our past E.L.E. that have occurred. Poisoning our planet with chemicals and POLLUTION is NOT HELPING , that is not the factor driving the problems we are facing today.

It will increase the extreme temperature ranges so that it will be colder and hotter in parts of the year that are colder and hotter; hotter summer, colder winter. one thing I point out is that they didn&#39;t see the long term dangers.this interviewer is putting words in the interviewee&#39;s mouth, that is something that should be looked at.the green new deal recognizes that people will loose jobs and it says that those people must get an opportunity to receive new jobs.the religious zeal part is a logical fallacy. the zeal, or tone he gives speeches in does not mean that this is religious.when that man said that saving the planet is &quot;his religion&quot; he meant that it is something that he focuses on and is always on his mind due to his great concern.the tax payer subsidizing part is a logical fallacy, were all subsidized by each other because we are all tax payers and that had no connection to the previous statement.listen to the scientist, it isn&#39;t an either or thing; both are important.

Due to chaos theory, we really can&#39;t even predict the weather more than 10days in advance, and often get it wrong day-of because of infinitely many variables that play a role (see also: butterfly effect). The main issue is that it&#39;s impossible to predict, so we don&#39;t actually know if, say, there&#39;s a 5deg shift, things just get hotter, or it really does wreak havok and consume half the current land mass with rising ocean levels. Regardless, everyone should agree that reducing pollution and such is only ever a good thing.	UCPjezJOPRU4bbsa-DfgtP4A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPjezJOPRU4bbsa-DfgtP4A	0

This is a fact. 5 out of the 10 most destructive typhoons on record have all happened after 2015. 2015 also featured the strongest hurricane on record by sustained wind; Hurricane Patricia, clocking in at 345km/h winds for a full minute, which had never been seen before, the previous record was only 315km/h set by Typhoon Haiyan of 2013. Droughts will become more frequent and so will flooding. We will suffer economic and political damage from Global Warming. This being said, I think it is total bullshit to suggest humanity will be eliminated from global warming.	UCabciD988v811X_fVT5PH6g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCabciD988v811X_fVT5PH6g	0

Fact: Burning fossil fuels emits carbon dioxide. Fact: CO2 is a greenhouse gas. Fact: Adding this greenhouse effect to a background global warming accelerates the warming. Fact: The rate of climate change has never been this high in human history. Fact: Warming occurs faster in the high latitudes than it does in mid and low latitudes. Fact: Melting ice caps reduces albedo and increases the rate that solar energy is absorbed. Fact: The oceans are warming. Fact: Warming ocean waters changes the circulation pattern and raises sea level. Fact: Local warming creates storms. And so on. If you are OK with all that then continue with your philosophy of &quot;What, me worry?&quot;. But please stop trying to get people to believe that the world&#39;s university climatic scientists are somehow in collusion so that they can make fortunes with their scare tactics. College athletic coaches make 4-5 times the salary and for what? Playing a game. I assure you John, this is not a game. The scientific &quot;debate&quot; is not whether climate change is occurring; the debate is what to do about it.	UCy3eeYpprt0luc6-4P_xtyQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy3eeYpprt0luc6-4P_xtyQ	0

This is mainly why it&#39;s believed to be a potential issue if human caused warming continues because it&#39;s not apart of the natural cycle that they kept bringing up in this video as warming being normally apart of, but human-induced warming isnt apart of the earth&#39;s natural flux. And if not global warming, look into ocean acidification which is an alarming issue for the shellfish that act as important components in the ocean&#39;s food web. It is true though that we don&#39;t know how more clouds from higher evaporation rates from higher temps will affect the planet, but so far we know that the changes are intensifying all weather phenomena. Dry seasons are getting longer and snow seasons are getting more intense but shorter in dessert climates, and even the jet stream is being affected, bringing colder winds from the poles to the northern US, intensifying their snow seasons with earlier onsets. So many factors, to the very least its important to stay aware of these phenomena and watch carefully. But yeah, it is too bad to see that the science is being overhyped when we gotta be more realistic and honest about the reliability of the projections. But it doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s no environmental issues like farmers over use of fertilizers(eutrophication), deforestation, ocean acidification, plastic issues, pollution, etc.<br /><br />The ozone issue was fixed by Jerry Rowland, UCIrvine&#39;s scientist, and it was his research that helped warn people, but wasnt until way later they finally did something about it. So we still cant just ignore the potential issues til its too late.	UCio_OYSDSZ77Ht6a_nYdSuQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCio_OYSDSZ77Ht6a_nYdSuQ	0

Imagine if our ancient ancestors had feared the ice melting because they&#39;d loose the land bridge between North America and Asia, and then been able, (hypotetically) to do something to stop it. Chicago would still be under a mile of ice. Would that be better? Of course not! But it&#39;s the same argument the climate fearmongers use today when they just assume that a warmer world will spell disaster.

I don’t think spending billions of dollars is the way to do it but if we had a large surplus of things such as solar panels we would be better off. Maybe we can start taxing gas and oil products like we do with cigarettes and use that money to help people afford things such as greener cars...

INCOME tax is theft, does that make you understand. The money I work for, that i earn should be left alone. The government has no business touching it. Consumer tax by itself would be more than enough to take care of infrastructure and the departments that keep our society safe. But of course our government cant be responsible with the money they get through our taxes, so they tax us even more, and we all know that our politicians have to keep getting that six figure salary for all that hard work they do, lol. These overpaid politicians and bloated departments like the EPA is where the real thievery is happening. If somone is struggling with even two jobs, maybe they should consider looking for a better paying job, live within their means, relocate to a more affordable area, or get a trade. That's the beauty of living in a free country and capitalism, there's always options.

"As you put it." Yes, that's how I put it because that's how it is. And yes, "unfortunately" people are on welfare programs, but studies show it's not a result of not working you ignorant fuck. Some people even work two jobs, but can't make ends meet or provide for their families because their income does not support a fair living. You rant about taxation being theft, yet you understand NOTHING. I think the phrase you are looking for, coined in the 1700's, is "no taxation without representation." Guess what dumbass, taxation is represented. As in for the best interests of the people, decided by the people, for the people! And through political processes that you've inherently agreed to by being a fucking citizen. What happens to that precious infrastructure we all depend on without them? Who's gonna pay for it?? The private sector who's sole concern is PROFITS?!? How about that free water, public safety, public transportation, FDA regulations to ensure safe food, drugs, medical devices, etc... That national security sure is nice. I guess we don't really need Fire or Police department agencies. The list goes on. Maybe think before you speak next time dip shit. Normally I don't revert to such hostile arguments, but you pushed first and I can't stand this simple-minded, tired, or rather expired argument. For the record, if anyone is robbing you, it's the tech giants, fossil fuel industry, big pharma, and other industries lobbying political interests that pay virtually ZERO in taxes.

Taxation is theft, in other words, you want something, get off your ass and work for it like the rest of us. Don't expect me to pay for it! All these bullshit, green policies are nothing but a joke and have nothing to do with helping the environment. They'll cost trillions to incorporate and in turn will hike taxes sky high.

TRUMP set up a charitable Foundation which was illegal Hillary Victory Fund Was never a CHARITY! It was a Campaign Fund. "PHILADELPHIA — Leaked emails show the Democratic National Committee scrambled this spring to conceal the details of a joint fundraising arrangement with Hillary Clinton that funneled money through state Democratic parties. But during the three-month period when the DNC was working to spin the situation, state parties kept less than one half of one percent of the $82 million raised through the arrangement — validating concerns raised by campaign finance watchdogs, state party allies and Bernie Sanders supporters. The arrangement, called the Hillary Victory Fund, allowed the Clinton campaign to seek contributions of hundreds of thousands of dollars to attend extravagant fundraisers including a dinner at George Clooney’s house and a concert at Radio City Music Hall featuring Katy Perry and Elton John. That’s resulted in criticism for Clinton, who has made opposition to big money in politics a key plank in her campaign platform. Clinton’s allies have responded publicly by arguing that the fund is raising big money to boost down-ballot Democratic candidates by helping the 40 state parties that are now participating in the fund.

One volcanic explosion that year did more environmental damage worldwide than all of mankind has done since the Industrial Revolution. Besides, with the Earth being billions of years old and weather records only being kept for the past 150 years or so, to say mankind is solely responsible and the science is settled is about as ignorant as it gets. What the dinosaurs went through 65 million years ago when that meteor smacked into the Yucatan peninsula and caused their extinction was way more extreme than what we're experiencing today. Millions of species went extinct long before mankind was on the scene. The Earth went through way more extreme heat and freezing cycles before mankind existed. John Stossel nailed it. The only reason the alarmists are ramming this climate change hysteria down our throats is because big money people are backing it, and frauds like Al Gore got filthy rich from all the fear-mongering.

Articles talking about weather as a weapon have been published since the 60s. Now cell towers emit frequencies for miles and miles. Anybody know the effect this has on vapor, liquids, and small particles? Geoengineering is real, and it climate change is created by it. Everyday human consumption pales in comparison to it.

Trump just erased an Obama regulation to restrict dumping in streams, lakes and ponds. He wants to remove air quality standards on cars. As stewards of quality of Life on planet Earth they side with the worst polluters constantly in favor of profits and more gold plating bathroom fixtures. Trump&#39;s Obama vendetta is a mental illness, one that hundreds of psychologists have undersigned as observable. When you unpack what republicans are up to you&#39;ll find similar problems.

But then, the vocabulary police suddenly (and rather abruptly) changed the term to &quot;climate change&quot;. The globalist elites hired out a group of so-called &quot;scientists&quot; to make use of junk science - and then come up with all kinds of phony and skewed results. The one thing we DO know is that there are cycles in solar activity. This is what is triggering any changes in our climate. Mankind&#39;s economic activities are not contributing to this. Climate change is a globalist-sponsored ideology. It is the intellectual play toy of the globalist financier plutocratic pedophile power elites. The climate change ideology is all about population reduction; that along with a massive redistribution of wealth and income, once the surviving power elites are able to suck up the spoils. It has naught to do with environmental protection.	UCD0HlsOq5Lfs9Irk-iASG5g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD0HlsOq5Lfs9Irk-iASG5g	0

UgyWHqhAieLYTgfc2tN4AaABAg	1	1	2019-09-18 13:30:20	mypresident Trump	The earths orbit controls its climate<br /><br /><br />Astronomer Milutin Milankovitch discovered this in the 1920s it is referred to as the Milankovitch cycles. <br /><br /><br />This is the climate science you&#39;ve never heard because the Earth&#39;s orbit cannot be guilt tripped into financial donations or votes. <br /><br /><br />The Milankovitch cycles show that the earth is on 100,000 year elliptical orbit around the sun at the coldest part we are 94.5 million miles from the sun at witch point we have glacier maximums 20 consecutive times this means northern hemisphere has been covered in glaciers down to Minneapolis, Chicago, New York and Moscow covered in ice for thousands years.<br /><br /><br />At 91.4 million miles the closest point in earth elliptical orbit we glacier minimum which means the northern hemisphere is glacier free this is happened 20 times in the last 2 million years. This means the north pole is open water year-round, green land if free of ice and ocean levels are much higher.<br /><br /><br />Man-made CO2 had nothing to do with the 20 previous glacier maximums and glacier minimums therefore it has nothing to do with the end of 21st glacier maximum which started 17,000 to 20,000 years ago that&#39;s when the glacier started to melt and the ocean started to rise.<br /><br /><br />This mind blowing scientific fact that the glacier started melting 17,000 years before Henry Ford came out with the model T the first mass-produced internal combustion engine means that the internal combustion engine is not melting the glaciers.<br /><br /><br />The Internal combustion engine does not drive climate change because we are in a climate cycle.<br /><br /><br />Milankovitch cycles also states the earth tilt or wobble which is what gives us winter, spring, summer and fall is on a 41,000 year cycle. That changes from 22.1 to 24.5. Our current title is 23.5 this is important because the wobble is a major factor in Earth&#39;s climate and is not being discussed in today&#39;s climate debate.<br /><br /><br />When I see politicians acting like witch doctors predicting the weather and threatening people for money and votes, when they can&#39;t even explain the Earth&#39;s climate history but are certain they can predict its future. I want to see Al Gore and AOC paint their face and dance around the fire and tell me they can make it rain or stop raining, Why can&#39;t we just sacrifice a goat and get on with using CO2.<br /><br /><br />CO2 is not a poison it&#39;s what plants breathe in, in exchange for oxygen and food. The elimination of CO2 would eliminate plant life causing all humans and mammals to suffocate from lack of oxygen and starvation from lack of food. The green new deal is a path to a Dead planet.<br /><br /><br />Inconvenient fact about CO2 human production of CO2 has increase crop yields by 40% over the last 150 years.<br /><br /><br />Little history on CO2, 600,000 years ago when the dinosaurs roamed the planet we had 12 times the amount of CO2 in the air, the earth climate was 13° warmer and the earth was perfectly fine, there were palm trees in the Arctic Circle and lizards had enough food to grow to the size of T Rex. I&#39;m pretty confident that the human species can adapt to the climate dinosaurs thrived it.<br /><br /><br />If the earths orbit controls its climate and man-made CO2 is not a poison but a blessing, then why do democratic and the democratic media focus on climate change, well the fundraising guilt trip is a factor.<br /><br /><br />When you look at AOC’s green new deal and its goal of zero CO2 emissions by 2030 you have to wonder does she not realize this is a fund raising scam to make money from the oil and utility industries or wait maybe the threat of putting them out of business in 10 years is the biggest fund raising scheme the Democrats have ever had.<br /><br /><br />Ask yourself how much would Exxon, BP and the entire Oil, Gas and Coal Industry donate to AOC and the Democrats too not be put out of business?<br /><br /><br />To the people of Iowa and farmers all across America, zero admissions means zero gasoline and diesel which also means zero ethanol subsidy. If you think the Trump trade war with china is bad for farm country try losing the ethanol subsidy.<br /><br /><br />Also to America&#39;s farmers without Diesel your tractors are useless are the Democrats promising to give it every farmer an electric tractor that doesn&#39;t currently exist to replace the diesel tractor that won&#39;t work in 10 years?<br /><br /><br />I call upon President Trump, Congress and the Secretary of Education to made Milankovitch cycles part of America&#39;s educational system K-12 and it America&#39;s official climate position.<br /><br /><br />I&#39;m producing a documentary film about all the earth orbit controls its climate you can find out more at <a href="http://orbitdener.com/">orbitdener.com</a> and <a href="http://mypresidenttrump.us/">mypresidenttrump.us</a> ©<br /><br /><br />Tim Anderson, political consultant, film producer and host<br />612-327-4152<br /><br /><br />Source material<br /><br /><br />North Caroline climate office <br /><br /><br />Wikipedia Milankovitch cycles<br /><br /><br />Milankovitch cycles	UCDPQCDeSxP4ZrhpQj9T8SgA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDPQCDeSxP4ZrhpQj9T8SgA	0

However, it&#39;s not 97% of climate scientists agreeing that mankind is causing the problem. Iti may be that 97% of climate scientist agree that the recent trend to global warming may be caused, or at least added to, by humans. However, I challenge anyone to present evidence that those 97% of climate scientists agree that changes in human behavior can stop the trend. All people need food and water and shelter, and most of those things require energy of some kind. Most of that energy cannot be supplied by solar or wind or even nuclear power....you know what...fuck it...whatever happens happens. Stick you heads in the sand, or propose &quot;solutions&quot; that are not really solutions. I don&#39;t care. By the time global warming becomes a real, life threatening problem, I&#39;ll be dead and gone. In the mean time, enjoy your arguments.

I agree with your advocacy. I totally think global warming is cyclical and will eventually cause another ice age someday. It&#39;s happened before and will happen again. It&#39;s how new life begins and flourishes. Lots of times new and exciting discoveries are made. Humans discovered fire after one and look what that wrought. Fire saved lives and helped it flourish. Don&#39;t we still use it even today? I believe that in the long run we will survive the next one, and if not just think of the innovations the planet will make to improve what was. After the t rex we got CHICKEN AND EGGS. What&#39;s mayo without eggs, cake, flapjacks the list is endless. Just saying.

Etc. <br />Everything else in science, especially regarding weather, is opinion. <br />Ref: hurricane Dorian that was going to make landfall in Florida move across hitting Alabama ~ but then it was going to hit Florida and Georgia, and changed again and finally hit North Carolina. <br />The 97% can&#39;t even calculate where a hurricane is going to hit and you want me to believe the projections they made in the 1990&#39;s?

We would need fossil fuels to convert solar energy into any kind of sustainable program and we don't have the technology to do it efficiently yet. Look at Germany's economic woes over energy and compare it to US with fracking, shale which helped lower our emissions. Destroying the economy of the US, Europe for a theory that hasn't manifested after many failed predictions is not "better safe than sorry" Scientists can't even simulate precipitation, clouds in their models--how can they say their projections are correct? They most certainly won't be as rain cools the earth's surface, clouds help control temperature and different cloud formations have different properties, some allowing more radiation back into space. All this while Antarctic ice is increasing after Gore claimed the poles could be gone by 2014. Climate Gate emails, disputes over Medieval Warm Period, the disparity between claims of global cooling in the late 70s vs global warming more recently, credible accusations of data alteration by NOAA, NASA, silencing of dissent and the fact that we have much fewer hurricanes, tornadoes, forest fires, droughts, famines now than compared to early in the 20th century all point to climate paranoia being just that. We're producing crops in record numbers and fewer people are dying from extreme weather events, and we've already sunk trillions of dollars away from the global economy for half baked plans that do nothing but make environmental nuts feel like they're making a difference.

He addresses all this VERY rationally, and with LOTS of temperature, ice, and sea level measurements, going back to the late 1800s. Conclusion: there is slight warming that&#39;s been going on for several hundred years (in a warming environment that&#39;s been going on for 10,000 years); High CO2 levels are mostly a RESULT of warming (by release of CO2 from oceans) and are only minimally a cause (yes, CO2 is a greenhouse gas, but one which is FAR less important than simple water vapor).

So let’s put this into dollars and cents,,, if you took 1,000,000 dollars only $400 would be CO2 and out of that $400 nature produces $388 and $12 is made by man. That is a very small amount. Greenhouses purchase CO2 generators to increase the CO2 from 400 ppm to 1000 ppm which is the optimum level for plant growth. So stop and think,,if CO2 was such a problem why do greenhouses increase the CO2 to get better vegetation growth. In fact if the CO2 level dropped to 170 to 150 ppm then all vegetation dies off and so do we!!! More and more extremely knowledgable scientists are coming forward and showing the FACTS that climate change is a hoax. Any warming is currently being caused by the sun, the moon and the earth alignment and it has nothing to do with CO2. You should copy and paste this to any people who may be considering voting liberal and just ask them for their opinion.

You cherry pick one or two people, who once did research in climatology, to now espouse their anti- climate change view so as to get noticed. But it is an infinitesimal voice of skepticism, overwhelmingly, those who still work in this field say climate change is real, and yes, a few degrees, on average will make a large difference.

Whether you&#39;re a climate change skeptic or believer, if you believe in logic and seek the truth, and want to test your ideas, are open to learning, and value have rational, fact-based discussions, check it out:<br /><br />NYC Conservative Climate Activists:<br /><a href="https://www.meetup.com/nyccca/">https://www.meetup.com/nyccca/</a><br /><br />Partial group summary:<br />&#39;We are a pro-human, pro-technology, market-friendly environmental group. <br /> <br />Visit our website: <a href="http://nyc-cca.com/">http://nyc-cca.com/ </a><br /> <br />The purpose of this meetup group is to investigate the science, engineering, and economics of climate change and its solutions. <br /> <br />There will be <b>NO</b> talk of polar bears, whales, or baby seals. <br /> <br />We take what Al Gore says with a grain of salt. He&#39;s a politician with a law degree, not a scientist. <br /> <br />We will devote considerable time to the debate over whether climate change is even happening, and whether it will be enough of a problem to justify action. Climate skeptics are very welcome to attend, but they should be aware that people who just come to disrupt, or who are rude, or shout and interrupt a lot, will not be tolerated.&#39;	UCe_Ntbmw72-7R2yczxKGPbg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe_Ntbmw72-7R2yczxKGPbg	0

I can understand why. <br /><br />But climate change is real. There is overwhelming evidence that temperatures are rising and ice is melting. The sea level WILL rise, extreme weather events will continue to get worse and more frequent, ecosystems will change and more species will go extinct. This is inevitable at this point, and this is already causing sever problems, but we can still have an impact on how bad it will get.<br /><br />If you&#39;re skeptical, think about this: Even if this is all not true, and climate change is one massive hoax or conspiracy or just an enormous blunder, consider this. Fossil fuel is a finite resource, which WILL run out. You may disagree with exactly when, but we use a shitload of it, have already mined an enormous amount of it, and it&#39;s inevitable that it will run out before too long. We need more sustainable sources of energy, fuel, plastics, etc. Even if climate change is all a hoax, converting to solar, wind, etc is good for everyone in the long run. It&#39;s also good for national security, and arguably good for the economy when you think about all the jobs (many of which cannot be outsourced) it will create. <br /><br />Also anyone who&#39;s sane must realize it&#39;s possible that they&#39;re wrong. Think about what it would mean if you&#39;re wrong. If I&#39;m wrong about climate change being real and a problem, and we take urgent steps to rapidly transition to sustainable energy sources and carbon capture, and implement things like a carbon tax and/or cap &amp; trade, the results still look pretty good to me: sustainable energy, cleaner environment, lots of new industry and jobs. Maybe more birds killed by wind turbines that some people find ugly.. <br />What if I&#39;m right and you&#39;re wrong, and even the mildest predictions of thousands of climate scientists is right? I think the outcome of that scenario is a bit more bleak... <br /><br />Please don&#39;t let your understandable contempt for the left lead you to automatically dismiss what scientists are telling us and erase all your humility and reason.. The message can be real even if the messenger is an ass.. To assume that you can&#39;t possibly be wrong when the stakes are this high, is reckless, short-sighted, and petty.

Ozone is a highly atmospheric Gas reactive molecule that contains three oxygen atoms. It is constantly being formed & broken down in the high atmosphere, 6.2 to 31 miles (10 to 50 kilometers) above Earth, in the region called the stratosphere. . The Ozone layer has deteriorated due to the release of industrial pollution containing the chemicals chlorine and bromine. Centuries of Massive Human Industry DUMPING TOXIC Gasses & Chemicals into our atmosphere. Such deterioration allows large amounts of ultraviolet B rays to reach Earth, which can cause skin cancer and cataracts in humans and harm animals as well. A Truly Conservative President, along with world leaders, took decisive & Affordable Action to fight for Earth. Some additional chemical threats to our climate/atmosphere have been added & proven successful. Google the Montreal Protocols.

He should limit this discussion to climate scientists, and not just cherry-pick the minority that claim there is no problem. Furthermore, the scientific method requires that data (Keeling curve, carbon isotope data, etc.) be examined. However, Stossel is not seriously interested in the science. Instead he plays to the cheap seats, because that&#39;s good for his ratings, and it&#39;s his routine. Good to see that you take things seriously, John.

There was a time when man walked across the bearing strait to north America. Slowly over thousands of years the land bridge disappeared because because of melting glaciers.

They want to legislate hydrocarbon burning vehicles right out of existence so they can sell you an Alfganistan lithium powered shit electric car. You idiot Americans take as gospel the first thing you hear out of the war mongers&#39; propaganda machine. The Earth has always had ice ages that ebb and flow.

It was just a minor hypothesis that arose after a few cold years that caught the media's attention. Global warming = climate change. Climate change is just a better descriptor to capture increased erratic climate instability.

Your claim that IPCC said no warming over a decade is simply false. scathing research & Warning about their PUMPING TOXCI WASTE GASES into our atmosphere ! . Pres. EISENHOWER'S Science Advisors & AAAS in 1958 & an even more serious Warning to Pres. JOHNSON IN 1965 about the DANGERS of TOXIC CO2 buildup & nearly 2dz TOXIC gasses Causing GLOBAL WARMING & its threatening changes to the climate of the entire world. . EVEN NATURE'S Warnings inflicted on the world in the form of ACID RAIN and OZONE Depletion . (( proven to be caused by Human & Industry dumping of Gasses / Chemicals into the atmosphere)) have been ignored or ridiculed by the USUAL SUSPECTS. (pro fossil fuels disinformation , Right Wing Propagandist ) *** and then THROUGH the LAST YEAR, by FAMED DENIERS -------> GLOBAL WARMING SKEPTICS / DENIERS Dr. Roy Spencer and Dr. John Christy . "Global Warming will cease to exist around 2000" as the "Earth returns to its historic cyclical fall in temps", into the next glaciation (ice age) . 1st THEY broadcast thousands of press releases about a " GLOBAL WARMING PAUSE ". Kinda like filling in the blanks while waiting for the mini ice age to start ? . 2nd THEN THEY broadcast more thousands of press releases about a " GLOBAL WARMING HIATUS ". Kinda like filling in the blank spaces with NOTHING but a Name Change. . 3rd AND THEN THEY came with thousands of press releases about a GLOBAL COOLING. (really?)(no data to support it) ... Then they announced a SOLAR MINIMUM was about to hit in 2007-2009...Look out snow in summer ! ....except, of course, temperatures continued rising! ... Roughly every two years, we’re treated to headlines repeating that 1970's ice age myth that Earth is headed for an imminent “mini ice age.” Thousands of Press Releases and Tweets, etc. .. Supporting a Global Warming Pause, Then Hiatus, then again Cooling, then a major cooling during the solar cycle 2007-2009, then again a Grand Solar Minimum to freeze our butts off starting in 2015, and Now again, 2020 is supposed to freeze our assets off. Roughly every two years, the Fossil Fuel Industrialists receive a spurt in Profits based on those Mythological Headlines. It happened in 2013, 2015, and again just recently at the tail end of 2019-2020. . We are, again, hearing about a NEW GRAND SOLAR MINIMUM Mini ICE AGE this year. . FROM THOSE LEADING CLIMATE CHANGE SKEPTICS / DENIERS . " A STUNNING ADMISSION: . "The UAH’s Dr. Roy Spencer & Dr. John Christy? —Both leading deniers? ---Both having predicted that Global Warming would End around 2000 as the Earth would return to its falling temps, as we enter the next Glaciation. . —reported just a few months ago, that the UAH data shows A “Global Temperature/Climate trend since Nov. 16, 1978 [of] +0.14C [0.22+F] -------------------> every decade” since then! -------> (no Pause in Warming? not even a slow down?) . THAT is 1.4C per century! -------------------> FAR HIGHER THAN ANY STATISTICAL Variant. In Geologic History, a truly rapid rise in temps was 5C over 5000 years! (( ---> 0.1C per century )) versus human caused temperature rise of over ((1.4C in 100 years! )) ((We are driving temps 14 times FASTER than normal)) . Temperatures have been increasing all along ! 1. NO Global Warming PAUSE ! -----> NONE ! 2. NO Global WarmingHIATUS ! -----> NONE ! 3. sure as hell, --NO COOLING ! -----> NONE ! . SKEPTIC Dr.Roy SPENCER: “my UAH cohort & boss John Christy, who does the detailed matching between satellites, is pretty convinced that the RSS data is undergoing " SPURIOUS COOLING " because RSS is still using the old NOAA-15 satellite which has a decaying orbit..." .. Spencer & Christy found it " ideologically convenient " to allow the decay inaccuracies to support their previous fallacious predictions. . So 2014 was the hottest temperatures ever recorded until 2015 was the hottest temperatures ever recorded until 2016 was the hottest temperatures ever recorded and 2017 was the hottest 2nd to 2016 ! 2018 just snuggled in between these 2 2019 has snuggled in next to 2016... .

As a Goldwater Conservative, the ide of subsidies to profitable industries is repugnant to me! U.S. News & World Report "..Tax rates going down, down, down.THE ASSOCIATED PRESS "AT TAXPAYERS FOR COMMON Sense, we recently analyzed the federal income taxes paid over the last five years by some of the largest U.S.-based oil and gas companies. What we found surprised us. "We set out to document the federal tax rate of oil and gas industry leaders because we knew the claim made by the American Petroleum Institute – that the industry pays an income tax rate of 44.3 percent – is misleading. The claim is misleading because the institute uses it in the context of reforming the federal tax code, but the figure includes all foreign, state and local taxes, as well as federal. When we looked at the financial statements of 20 of the largest oil and gas companies, we found this group paid an average federal tax rate of 24 percent on its U.S. income. "This was not surprising. It is no secret the federal tax code is riddled with broad exceptions and deductions allowing many industries to pay much less than the standard 35 percent corporate rate. In fact, one of the goals of tax reform is to lower the overall corporate rate by removing the system of distortive tax preferences that require companies to change their behavior in order to qualify. "What was surprising, though, was the extent to which these companies were able to delay or defer the payment of the federal taxes they accrued. Most of the companies in our study deferred more than they actually paid. When the deferred taxes are subtracted from the amount these 20 companies owe, their average “current” tax rate drops to 11.7 percent. The independent oil and gas companies in the bottom half of our list, excluding the ones that recorded losses for the period, deferred almost all of the federal income taxes they accrued during the last five years, reporting an average current tax rate of just 3.7 percent.

First off the so-called subsidies you speak of to the oil industry or nothing more than tax cuts, simply letting them keep their own money. Real subsidies or when the government distributes tax dollars to a certain entity, like "green energy" welfare. You Liberals are always claiming that these big government schemes are going to save us lots of money and that they're actually profitable but if that were the case the free market would be doing that already. Instead they turn out to be massive waste of money, Manpower and time as well as resources. All these things you're talking about would require massive amounts of government control and ungodly amounts of spending which would simply drive us in the bankruptcy sooner. We're already spending insanely too much money as it is without having your pipe dream of hiring hundreds of thousands of people to plant trillions of trees. When you want the government to dictate what kind of energy is used and shut down gigantic Industries like coal? Good God man get a grip on it! The sky is not falling, the coastal cities are not flooding nor are they going to flood and the temperatures are going to fluctuate over time. We don't need to impose a 1984 style system on our country to solve this imaginary problem.

"There is no need to add additional taxes to combat climate change. The best bet is simply QUIT SUBSIDIZING those human activities which causing AGW. . Worldwide, Fossil Fuels & industries suck up subsidy Dollars. SUCK UP roughly 6.5% of GDP ... TRILLIONS of DOLLARS in subsidies/supports (nontaxable supports & subsidies!) ... In most cases, the newer more modern energy and agricultural systems are more profitable and less damaging to the environment already. So there is no need to tax people to subsidize those things harming the environment, then taxing us again to penalize those same ones we just subsidized! A house divided against itself cannot stand. -Lincoln (paraphrasing the Bible) It is time for a strong political leader to take charge and end this deadlock. ... We could either reduce taxes and let the new technologies outcompete the obsolete systems we depend on now, or we could keep taxes the same and simply redirect the subsidies we use for fossil fuels and destructive industrialized agriculture towards modern sustainable systems instead. The one thing that won’t work is keeping the tax and spend schemes the Neo-Luddites have made for themselves now, and also add even more tax and spend schemes for their competing new technologies too! Yes, that’s right, the top two causes for global warming are heavily subsidized.[1][2][3][4] It is literally insanity. ... Michael Barnard, Low-carbon Innovation Strategist What’s emerging is the following: Electrify everything. Convert all energy services to work directly from electricity instead of fossil fuels. Transportation, industry, and agriculture. All of it. All gas appliances must go. All road transport must be electric. Most trains and a lot of planes must shift to electricity. All heat from electricity. The USA throws away two-thirds of all primary energy, mostly in the form of waste heat from fossil fuels used in inherently inefficient combustion processes. We only have to replace a third of the actual primary energy we use today to maintain our lifestyle and economy. Overbuild renewable generation. All other forms of generation with the exception of nuclear were overbuilt, so we’ll do the same with wind and solar, and they are really cheap, so that’s not that expensive. After all, $3 trillion USD would provide all primary energy for everything the US does. Build continent-scale electrical grids and markets, and improve existing ones. HVDC became much more viable with high-speed hybrid circuit breakers in 2011 and is an essential technology for long-distance, low-loss electrical transmission. Build a fair amount of hydro storage and some other storage. While the storage of electricity is an overstated concern given overbuilt renewables and continent-scale grids, some is still required. Pumped hydro resource potential is far greater than the need, is efficient and uses very stable, known technologies. Shifting existing hydro-electric dams to be passive, on-demand storage as opposed to baseload is also key. Fast response grid storage can be provided by existing lithium-ion technologies, as Tesla has proven in California and Australia. By 2050, we’ll have roughly 20 TWh of batteries on wheels in US cars alone, available both for demand management to reduce peak demand, soak up the excess generation and to provide vehicle-to-grid electricity as needed. Plant a lot of trees. We have cut down about 50% of the six trillion trees that used to grow on earth. Planting a trillion trees would buy us a lot of time as they sucked about a ton of CO2 from the atmosphere per tree over 40 years. Change agricultural practices. High-tillage agriculture is a process that keep releasing carbon captured by the soil back into the atmosphere. Switching to low-tillage would buy us a lot of time as the CO2 captured by farmland would stay in the soil a lot longer, and some of it would be permanently sequestered. Fix concrete. 8% of global CO2 emissions come from making Portland cement. It’s absolutely critical to urban densification and industry, so we won’t stop making it. But it’s a huge source of CO2, about half from the energy and half from CO2 that bakes off limestone as it’s turned into quicklime. Electrifying that energy flow helps a lot, but capturing that CO2 is one of the few places where mechanical carbon capture makes sense. Price carbon aggressively. The simplest way to get a lot of people and industries to shift away from emitting lots of CO2 is to make it expensive. That’s what carbon taxes do. Shut down coal and gas generation aggressively. Getting rid of coal is already happening, but it’s by far the biggest single source of CO2 emissions. Aggressive actions to eliminate burning coal are needed. For gas, the question is how few gas plants can we build, how many of them can we run on biologically sourced methane and how fast can we shut them down. Stop financing and subsidies for fossil fuel exploration, extraction and use. The USA alone spends tens of billions annually on subsidies of various kinds for the fossil fuel industry, and hasn’t done a thing about it since committing to eliminate them in 2009. The G7 and G20 have committed to eliminating subsidies, but progress has been very slow. The World Bank continues to finance coal, oil and gas projects, despite commitments to end them. Eliminate HFCs in refrigeration. The Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer targets the unforeseen side effects of displacing ozone-depleting CFCs with high-greenhouse gas HFCs. Project Drawdown puts this at #1 on its ranked list of solutions by cost vs benefit. The USA has not ratified this Amendment, although 65 other countries have.

(-------That WAS a LIE 2 months ago and THAT is STILL a lie, today-------) • 3 days ago, Trump said the US will run 5 million daily virus tests “very soon.” (THAT WAS A LIE THEN and is STILL A LIE TODAY ! ! We currently run about 220,000 daily) . • 2 days ago, on the same day that we became the first nation in the world with 1,000,000 cases and more US deaths than the Vietnam war, the Trump administration called their response a “great success story.” (It is not) For months, Donald Trump downplayed the crisis and didn’t take it seriously when he should have been listening to the repeated warnings of experts, preparing our nation with enough supplies, and taking decisive action to stop the virus from spreading more rapidly. In fact, on January 9, January 14, January 18, January 19, January 28, January 30, February 1, February 10, February 15, February 19, February 20, February 21, February 28, March 7, and March 8, Trump was playing golf or at a campaign rally instead of preparing for the pandemic ahead. Thanks to Trump’s slow response and failure to deliver on his promises to secure enough tests and masks, the US is paying the price: • The US is only 4% of the world’s population, but has more than ? of the world’s reported cases -- more than 1.13 million; • The US leads the world with more than 60,000 deaths ------> more than the Vietnam War; • At least 30 million Americans have lost their jobs amid the economic crisis caused by Trump’s botched coronavirus response. Unfortunately, nothing indicates that Trump has learned from his past failures. All we see is the same impulsive, erratic, and chaotic decision-making that got us into this mess. Today, our asks are simple: 1. Watch this video.

Ugzm8Q2-fEInBjcoxZF4AaABAg.8y3QddRy4my9803Hw8JRTB		0	2020-04-28 21:37:46	Randy Mayr	Sophie Erskine Mark Bahner, a commenter on my previous post on global warming and on David Friedman’s post, has sifted through the data behind John Cook’s statement that 97% of climate scientists who stated a position believe that humans are the main cause of global warming. Recall that Bedford and Cook lumped together those who believe that humans are the main cause with those who believe that humans are a cause. Cook et al did not report the percent of abstracts in which the scientists said that humans are the main cause of global warming. But Bedford and Cook (the same Cook), citing Cook et al, misrepresented the results of Cook et al. Unfortunately, neither Cook et al nor Bedford and Cook reported, even though they had a category for, the percent of abstracts that claimed that humans are the main cause of global warming. Fortunately, Mark Bahner, an enterprising commenter on both David Friedman’s and my posts, managed to find their data and went through and did his own calculation. He reported his results in a comment on my previous post but, because the post was two days ago, it’s worth pointing out in a separate post. Thus this one. According to Bahner (and I have not gone through and checked the raw data for myself), of the 11,944 abstracts that Cook et al examined, only 64 claimed explicitly that humans are the main cause of global warming. Here are the categories that Cook et al state. I have added the numbers that Bahner found beside each. 1,Explicitly endorses and quantifies AGW as 50+% : 64 2,Explicitly endorses but does not quantify or minimize: 922 3,Implicitly endorses AGW without minimizing it: 2910 4,No Position: 7970 5,Implicitly minimizes/rejects AGW: 54 6,Explicitly minimizes/rejects AGW but does not quantify: 15 7,Explicitly minimizes/rejects AGW as less than 50%: 9 So 64 out of 11,944, or 0.5%, take the view that humans are the main cause of global warming. But that includes all abstracts, including those that did not take a position. It would be nice to take the 64 as a percent of those that did take a position. Unfortunately, in their data set, Cook et al put 4a, those that do not address the cause of global warming, with 4b, those that express the view that humans’ role in global warming is uncertain or undefined. It would be nice to separate them, but we can’t unless we have the even rawer data. So let’s generously conclude that everyone in category 4 has expressed no view. That’s a total of 7970, leaving a total of 3,974 that have expressed a view. The 64 who think the main cause is humans is, drum roll please: 1.6%. 1.6% is pretty different from 97%.

By Joe Scarborough April 25, 2020 at 6:18 p.m. CDT President Trump has been stumbling through a year of magical thinking. The consequences of this deadly state of denial have been catastrophic for pandemic victims and the U.S. economy. In January, Trump said the coronavirus threat was “one person coming in from China”: “We have it totally under control . . . it’s going to be just fine.” But the president’s intelligence community had been warning him for weeks about the coming threat when he made that spurious claim. In February, Trump predicted the virus would go away by April. “It’s like a miracle. It will disappear.” That reckless prediction also came weeks after White House staff warned the virus could imperil millions of Americans’ lives while costing the U.S. economy trillions of dollars. Full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic In March, the president told worried Republican senators to “just stay calm” because “it will go away.” Trump spent much of that month ignoring Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, by declaring that the untested use of a malaria drug to treat covid-19 could be “one of the biggest game-changers in the history of medicine.” This week, the Food and Drug Administration had to warn Americans against the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat the virus because it caused “serious heart rhythm problems.” Throughout April, Trump’s magical thinking continued full force, with the flustered president assuring reporters this week that covid-19 “might not come back at all” this fall. Fauci again had to correct the president’s spurious claims. The next day, Trump publicly peppered his staff and medical team about the imagined benefits of ingesting disinfectants and implanting lights for pandemic patients. Once again, Trump’s own administration had to warn the public against believing the president’s ramblings. As the former reality TV host trotted out these baseless remedies and delusional denials at his afternoon news conferences, 53,000 Americans died from a disease that did not go away miraculously in April. Instead, as former vice president Joe Biden predicted in January, Trump left America ill-prepared for the coming pandemic. Trump and Fox News’s Sean Hannity were still claiming in March that the press was overblowing a crisis that Hannity declared was being used to “bludgeon Trump again with this new hoax.” A month after the cable news host pushed out that obscene and dangerous disinformation, covid-19 killed more Americans on a single day in April than died in combat during the United States’ 19-year war in Afghanistan. These deaths do not rest solely on the president’s shoulders, of course. China’s communist regime bears much of the responsibility for refusing to warn the world of the horrors unfolding in its country. But even this raises the question of why Trump was praising China’s communist regime in late January. “China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus,” the president tweeted. “The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. . . . In particular, on behalf of the American People, I want to thank President Xi!” Trump’s admiration of China’s “transparency” had to be particularly galling to administration officials who spent that month trying to get Xi’s regime to share virus samples and health-care data that could have greatly helped prepare America. Even Trump’s toothless travel ban likely had little effect on the disease’s spread. At least 430,000 people have streamed into the United States from China since the outbreak, including some 40,000 travelers after the so-called ban was put in place. Making matters worse, Trump ignored health-care officials calling for the shutdown of European travel. He listened instead to his treasury secretary, who worried that such a ban could spook financial markets. It would be six more weeks before Trump stopped travel from Europe. The impact of the delay was devastating for New York. The Opinions section is looking for stories of how the coronavirus has affected people from all walks of life. Write to us. While the president’s supporters frantically search for errant predictions among Democrats or members of the press, their efforts are undercut by Trump himself, who insists on proving every night just how ill-suited he is for his job. The man he will likely be competing against in November’s election warned Americans months ago that the coronavirus would get worse. “To be blunt,” the presumptive Democratic nominee wrote in USA Today, “I am concerned that the Trump administration’s shortsighted policies have left us unprepared for a dangerous epidemic that will come sooner or later.” Biden’s warning was all too prescient. The United States now finds itself in the worst crisis since World War II with a leaderless suited for the presidency than anyone who has ever occupied the office. Any hope that Trump can somehow rise to this once-in-a-lifetime challenge with even a modicum of competence would be the same sort of magical thinking that has plagued this country since the outbreak of this terrible disease. Four months of delusional decisions coming from the White House have not produced a miracle cure. Instead, the country is more vulnerable than ever to a deadly pandemic and a debilitating financial collapse. As long as Donald Trump remains in the White House, the crisis that stalks our land will only get worse.

Only the Enhanced Green House Effect fully Explains this ongoing event! Look: https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-whats-warming-the-world/ . These are not ideas! Invented by Modern Science, Dr. Michael Mann, Karl Marx, or Groucho Marx. . 1799 Alexander von Humboldt studied, worried and postulated that Human Activities / Pollution would CAUSE "CLIMATE CHANGE"! Strip Mining entire mountain tops, Clear Cutting entire Forests, burning Coal/Peat/Wood/Oil, building huge cities which create their own climates . Alexander von Humboldt Coined the Term "Climate Change" in 1799. The First USE of " CLIMATE CHANGE "/ the definition of which is still in use today. . 1799 Thomas Jefferson also penned a paper on observed "climate change" which he stated was probably caused by man...and had many discussions with John Adams on these climate changes. . 1804 Thomas Jefferson(scientist/philosopher/politician) On Climate Change/Real Science. -----> “A change in our climate is taking place very surely. Both heat and cold are becoming moderate within the memory of even the middle-aged, and snows are less frequent and less deep.” . 1811 Scientists Tied Warming, Climate Changes directly to Human Activities & Industrialization. . 1824 Jean-Baptiste Fourier calculates that the Earth would be far colder if it lacked an atmosphere. Certainly, "...Tyndall’s equipment, laboratory and experimental results were more sophisticated than Eunice Foote’s, and he is rightly credited with establishing the experimental basis for the greenhouse effect, first suggested by Swiss physicist Horace Bénédict de Saussure in the 1760s and later developed by French mathematician Joseph Fourier in the 1820s and French physicist Claude Pouillet in 1836..." . 1856 "....a paper entitled “Circumstances affecting the heat of the sun’s rays,” by Eunice Foote. In two brisk pages, Foote’s paper anticipated the revolution in climate science by experimentally demonstrating the effects of the sunlight on certain gases and theorizing how those gases would interact with Earth’s atmosphere for the first time. In a column of the September 1856 issue of Scientific American titled “Scientific Ladies,” Foote is praised for supporting her opinions with “practical experiments.” The writers noted: “this we are happy to say has been done by a lady.” . Foote’s research & paper demonstrated the interactions of the sun’s rays on different gases through a SERIES of experiments...." . ((Variations of those fundamental Experiments are critiqued/taught in nearly every 1st-year science course on colleges and universities around the world.)) . 1896 Svante Arrhenius (1859-1927) was a Swedish scientist that was the first to claim in 1896 that fossil fuel combustion may eventually result in enhanced global warming. . 1931 "Hulburt's own calculations supported Arrhenius's estimate that doubling or halving CO2 would bring something like a 4°C rise or fall of surface temperature, and thus "the carbon dioxide theory of the ice ages... is a possible theory."(11) Hardly anyone noticed this paper. Hulburt was an obscure worker at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, and he published in a journal, the Physical Review, that few meteorologists read." . 1935 Still, Science largely believed: "Fifty times more carbon is dissolved in seawater than in the wispy atmosphere." "Just like the Sea, plants would grow more lush and thus That would Control/Balance CO2 influence on Climate.?? . 1948 It was thought "The a self-regulating mechanisms of the carbon cycle can cope with the present influx of carbon of fossil origin." . The 1940s "...Callendar....concluded that over the past hundred years the concentration of the gas (CO2) had increased by about 10%. This rise, Callendar asserted, could explain the observed warming. . 1952 "...Digital computers were now at hand for such calculations. The theoretical physicist Lewis D. Kaplan decided it was worth taking some time away from what seemed like more important matters to grind through extensive numerical computations.

The predictions did not come true and the science did not bear out. Weather was Noel Brown saying that entire nations will be wiped off the face of the Earth by 2000 or Forum for the Future saying that by 2040 we're going to have three and a half million refugees fleeing to live in Antarctica, these predictions are bogus over and over again. https://www.westernjournal.com/10-failed-global-warming-predictions/ Dr. Dennis Rancourt who taught environmental science at the University of Ottowa has concluded that the man-made global warming Theory doesn't hold water despite his own left-of-center and an environmentalist views https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=VWVXarkPOAo and Dr. David Evans of the Australian Greenhouse Project said that the climate models showing global warming were decisively wrong. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=s99z2yRmqiM But anyway back to my original point, Lord Monckton's Theory alone pretty much blew out of the water current recommendations for combating so-called global warming. That's what I want you to address and describe what measures you think should be taken in light of that.

These YOUTUBE Videos are SLICK productions but you can't get the references or the studies that supposedly support their points.....on any side of any issue. . https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11659-climate-myths-ice-cores-show-co2-increases-lag-behind-temperature-rises-disproving-the-link-to-global-warming ============= http://web.mit.edu/vpr/climate/MIT_Climate_Change_Conversation_Report_2015.pdf ============= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0x46-enxsA&feature=em-uploademail ----------- High Energy Solar Radiation is transmitted thru Earth's Atmosphere, 'largely non-reactive' to those gases...though some are reflected. . This Energy heats the earth and the atmosphere. ..without the atmosphere, Earth would become an ice planet when sunsets...rendering life-on-earth impossible. . The Earth then emits this warmth as a Lower Energy Heat Emission toward the cold of space. This form of energy ( Infra-Red Thermal Radiation) is highly reactive with atmospheric gases, (( unlike High Energy SOLAR Radiation )) . Scientists around the world Worry about this Current Warming Phenomenon as it's Coinciding with Earth's " farthest orbit swing away " from the sun. (Earth's Source of Heat ) ( we should be COOLING ) . Similarly, Scientists worry because the Northern Hemisphere/Earth's Axis is also tilted away from the Sun ( this too means we should be COOLING ) . Scientists worry that all this Coincides with Earth's wobble, which is conducive to COOLING. Coinciding with a solar cycle which has been decreasing in output a bit, for over 40 Years. ( we should be cooling ) . In fact, Earth Was behaving in a typical way for MANY thousands of years ... This Inter Glacial Warm Period had PEAKED in temperatures roughly 8,000 years ago and WE HAD BEEN COOLING since then, as we have done for millions of years...a natural cycle of coolings with brief interglacial warmings. . THAT is an average 100,000-year cycle which is triggered by the Milankovitch Cycles. . You have to question ((( WHY IS IT NOT COOLING ? ))) ((( What's Changed? ))) Detailed Observations and much Scientific discussions/experimentations have gone into WHY Temps are Warming contrary to Earth's most powerful natural cycles to cool. * "....summary of 10 direct, measured lines of empirical evidence that point to human-induced climate change. In some cases, I have added layman's references in addition to the more rigorous citations Burning Fossil Fuels Correlates with Rising CO2. Humans are currently emitting around 30+ billion tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere every year (CDIAC(ornl.gov)). Human Activities produce over 100+ times MORE CO2 than all of the Volcanoes on Earth Combined/year! ( 0.3- billions tons by volcanoes versus 30+ billion tons by mankind.) Of course, it could be a coincidence that CO2 levels are rising so sharply at the same time so let's look at more evidence that we're responsible for the rise in CO2 levels. . The proportion of Carbon-12 is increasing. (a distinct Burning-Fossil-Fuel isotope) When we measure the type of carbon accumulating in the atmosphere, we observe more of the type of carbon that comes from fossil fuels (Manning 2006 (noaa.gov)). How do we know that recent CO<sub>2</sub> increases are due to human activities? (realclimate.org)] . Oxygen Levels Dropping. This is corroborated by measurements of oxygen in the atmosphere. ( at over 150 locations worldwide ) . Oxygen levels are falling in line with the amount of carbon dioxide rising, just as you'd expect from fossil fuel burning which takes oxygen out of the air to create carbon dioxide (Manning 2006 (noaa.gov)). . Coral Also Confirms They're Fossil Carbons. Further independent evidence that humans are raising CO2 levels comes from measurements of carbon found in coral records going back several centuries. These find a recent sharp rise in the type of carbon that comes from fossil fuels ( Pelejero 2005 ( sciencemag.org) ). . More Heat is Being Trapped at the precise CO2's wavelengths ( & nearly 2dz. other gasses ). So we know humans are raising CO2 levels. What's the effect? Multiple Satellites ( multiple nations ) measure less heat actually escaping out to space, at the particular wavelengths that CO2 absorbs heat (and other gasses as well) , thus finding "direct experimental evidence for a significant increase in the Earth's greenhouse effect". . (Harries 2001 (nature.com), (Griggs 2004 (aip.org), (Chen 2007 (eumetsat.eu)). . More Downward Infrared Radiation. . If less heat is escaping to space, > > where is it going? . MUCH of it is Back to the Earth's surface. Surface measurements confirm this, observing more downward infrared radiation (Philipona 2004 (agu.org), (Wang 2009 (agu.org)). . A closer look at the downward radiation finds more heat returning at CO2 wavelengths, leading to the conclusion that "this experimental data should effectively end the argument by skeptics that no experimental evidence exists for the connection between greenhouse gas increases in the atmosphere and global warming." (Evans 2006 (confex.com)). . It's Not the Sun---- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_activity_and_climate#/media/File:Solar_irradiance_and_temperature_1880-2018.jpeg If an increased greenhouse effect is causing global warming, we should see certain patterns in the warming. For example, the planet should warm faster at night than during the day. This is indeed being observed ( Braganza 2004 (sjsu.edu), Alexander 2006 (knmi.nl) ). [Blog explanation: Human Fingerprint on Climate Change: Nights warming faster than days (skepticalscience.com)] https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/07/11/climate/summer-nights-warming-faster-than-days-dangerous.html and the Stratosphere is Cooling Since the Heat Is Being Trapped in the Troposphere. . https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/2013-state-climate-stratospheric-temperature . Another distinctive pattern of greenhouse warming is cooling in the upper atmosphere, otherwise known as the stratosphere. . This is exactly what's happening (Jones 2003 (agu.org)). . The Tropopause is Rising. With the lower atmosphere (the troposphere) warming & the upper atmosphere ( the stratosphere ) cooling, another consequence is the boundary between the troposphere and stratosphere, otherwise known as the tropopause, should rise as a consequence of greenhouse warming. . This has been observed (Santer 2003 (nyu.edu)). . The Ionosphere is Contracting. An even higher layer of the atmosphere, the ionosphere, is expected to cool and contract in response to greenhouse warming. This has been observed by satellites (Laštovi?ka 2006 (cas.cz)). . In addition to the 10 indicators proposed by skeptical Science, there are many other empirically demonstrated lines of evidence for the rapid warming the earth is undergoing that should also be considered. . Here are two such items. . 11) Species are headed to the poles and/or higher elevations. According to published research in the journal Science from August 2011, species are heading toward the poles and/or higher elevations. (Source: Rapid Range Shifts of Species Associated with High Levels of Climate Warming) (The Lowly Pine Beetle, confined by COLD Temps. for millennia, to Southern Latitudes ...… is now found routinely north of Fairbanks Alaska and across near the Arctic circle, Canada. Canadian Forestry Officials complain that this beetle NOW fells more Lodgepole Pines than Logging & Forest Fires Combined.) . 12) Plants are blooming far earlier each year. NASA research supports this (Source: Decades of Data Show Spring Advancing Faster Than Experiments Suggest) as well as 2011 the University of California-San Diego study of Arctic blooms of phytoplankton (Source: Researchers discover arctic blooms occurring earlier) . 13) Antarctica has its first invasive species! . 14) Volcanic carbon dioxide emissions helped trigger the Tumultuous Triassic climate change Posted: 14 Apr 2020 09:57 AM PDT A new study finds volcanic activity played a direct role in triggering extreme climate change at the end of the Triassic period 201 million years ago, wiping out almost half of all existing species. Finally, I leave you two excellent data points to consider: Wide Spread Scientific Agreement. (1) Scientific Consensus. No scientific organization of national or international standing opposes the Widespread SHARED UNDERSTANDING (consensus} regarding human-induced effects on climate change. (Source: Scientific opinion on climate change) . For those who may allege conspiracy, consider the sheer number and diversity of the organizations listed here, representing diverse scientific backgrounds from Western and non-Western nations alike. . (Besides, if this were a conspiracy, how did they get plants and animals to collude? For That Matter, how did they get Muslims and Jews and Christians to agree) (2) Independent Analyses and Converted Skeptics: In 2012, a Berkeley physicist completed an independent research project, funded in part by fossil fuel billionaires (the Koch brothers), to evaluate raw global temperature data and come to its own conclusions.

The second simply shows the amount of ice lost not gained therefore flawed Your third only has data from June and June ice has in fact decreased Sadly again no data for other months is not shown biased for anyone uneducated since one will believe this one reflects other monthly trends It in fact does not. Here is some AWAKENING info from Rutgers University global snow lab Sponsored or in line with EUROPEAN ENVIRONMENT AGENCY These are the total seasonal snow extents since 1967 You will educate yourself that Northern hemisphere global ice and snow is MELTING in LARGER quantities in SPRING and some summer months ( insert you third graph here) But FALL AND WINTER SNOW EXTENT IS INCREASING Have a look https://climate.rutgers.edu/snowcover/chart_seasonal.php?ui_set=namgnld&ui_season=4 More snow is melting in spring months but is increasing in fall and winter Please this is from european environment agency it is not contaminated with right ideology and bias it is contaminate with FACTS AND THIS IS NOT EVEN MENTIONING THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE But i’m sure you will not mention that since it’s a loss for your cause.

After weeks of unrelenting coverage hyping the antimalarial drug as a potentially game-changing treatment for the coronavirus, the network has all but stopped mentioning it on its airwaves. So has President Donald Trump. Hmmmmmmm? The quiet abandonment of hydroxychloroquine comes as studies indicate it is not an effective treatment against the coronavirus. A French study found last week that the drug does not help patients with the virus. And on Tuesday, a study of hundreds of patents at US Veterans Health Administration medical centers found that patients who took hydroxychloroquine were NO less likely to need ventilation and had higher death rates than those who didn't take the drug. "Will anyone who breathlessly pitched hydroxychloroquine as a miracle drug show a modicum of regret or even self-awareness over this? Doubtful," The Daily Beast's Sam Stein predicted. "More likely is they'll ignore the study entirely." Stein appears to have been right on the money. Despite having previously pushed the drug as a possible treatment, neither Tucker Carlson nor Sean Hannity mentioned the study on their Fox News shows Tuesday night. I didn't see Laura Ingraham, who reportedly visited the White House to promote the drug, discuss it either. Fox published a digital story on the Tuesday study, but it fell off the website's homepage after a few hours...." More BLOOD on the BLOWHARD'S HANDS! TRUMP MUST RESIGN!

The “inconvenient truth” of the film was that because of our efforts to increase our affluence and comfort, the world was warming quicker than would be expected under natural conditions. We humans were changing the atmosphere, and most of the effects of this change would be bad—bringing more misery to the poor, uncertainty to our crop harvests, and death to many other species we share the planet with. Although the main precepts underlying the notion of global warming were known and accepted by science at that time, Gore and his film added fuel to a simmering political debate. Pro-industry conservative politicians and their supporters (many of whom saw global warming as a hoax designed to bilk taxpayers out of their money) lined up on one side, while scientists and more-liberal politicians (who pressed that global warming was among the most important issues humanity would face) teamed up on the other. Gore introduced the Keeling Curve—a graph depicting seasonal and annual changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations since 1958 at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii—to show how the burning of fossil fuels by industry and transportation, as well as other human activities, were changing the gaseous mix of the planet’s lower atmosphere. In the summer of 2006, atmospheric CO2 concentrations stood at 395 parts per million (ppm). (Today [2016], they flirt with the 407-ppm mark.) Much of his effort in the film involved drawing contrasts between conditions before and after the Industrial Revolution and illustrating how the rapid changes in atmospheric carbon in modern times were unlike anything that had taken place in several hundred thousand years. Most remember the film as part motivational science lecture with slick graphics and part self-reflection. Gore got much of the science correct. His overall thesis, that activities that added more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere were changing the climate—that is, allowing the atmosphere to retain a greater share of the energy delivered by solar radiation—was solid, though some of the facts presented in the movie need to be revised slightly because of new research. For example, Gore emphasized the role of the planet’s thermohaline circulation (the Great Ocean Conveyor Belt, which replaces seawater at depth with water from the surface and slowly replaces surface water elsewhere with water rising from deeper depths, moving water around Earth’s oceans), but 10 years hence, this phenomenon may not be that critical to regulating climate. Yet one of the most-shocking parts of the movie, a sequence of imagery depicting flooding scenarios driven by projected sea-level rise, is becoming very real—especially in some of the low-lying islands in the Pacific and the Maldives in the Indian Ocean. The manifestation of other phenomena predicted by the movie, however, is less clear. Gore worried about more-frequent, more-intense Katrina-esque superhurricanes, but, Superstorm Sandy (2012) aside, such monster storms have not struck the United States, although the Pacific region has weathered a series of extremely strong typhoons, such as Haiyan (2013) and Pam (2015), since the movie’s release..."

If it fails to predict correctly bin it and replace it. A little paragraph from this article models predicted that there would be much greater warming between 1998 and 2014 than actually happened. If the models were doing a good job, their predictions would cluster symmetrically around the actual measured temperatures. That was not the case here; a mere 2.4 percent of the predictions undershot actual temperatures and 97.6 percent overshot, according to Cato Institute climatologist Patrick Michaels. https://www.hoover.org/research/flawed-climate-models MODELS will always BE RIGHT because there will always be one that works Even if 100 FAILED https://youtu.be/qZN2jt2cCU4 A very credible scientist Dr. Singer predictions vs truth https://youtu.be/5UKI3lKts9Q I could no longer find the paper with the link that leads to the ipcc statement on the unreliability of climate models and I do not have the time to find it in a 300 page book, you will have to trust me on that one of course you don’t have to. The mini ice age alarmism was quite similar to climate change alarmism Insane predictions speakers coming into class to tell CHILDREN they will die under meters of ice It is quite difficult to imagine oil companies were behind it since there was of course a drop in temperature over a couple years. Even though co2 levels were rising. At the time co2 had the opposite affect it was cooling the climate (not really) but that was a time before global warming was an issue much less anything anyone cared about or had heard of so it is quite difficult to believe that oil companies would invest billions into such a shortsighted cause. There is little evidence that it was orchestrated by oil companies. A little memoire an elder like you might remember (if ur profile pick is you) A little look at how PROVEN the science was and how there SHOULD BE NO DEBATE that the earth is cooling. https://youtu.be/zSDLRm3jhc8 I am a child as you said I’m only 14 and i have to complete my online classes so I don’t have time to recall and re-research my knowledge on climate change to find all my old sources. My final verdict is that climate change is overhyped and is a tool in a political power struggle. It is no longer a cause it is a multi million dollar business and a corrupt one at that. I believe that humans are not the principal influencing factor in our constantly fluctuating climate, of course we should be working against minimizing our emission and our pollution. But the way it is done now and the way it is working it is just another corrupt power struggle and a tool to control people	UCJX9wUqbToyqEPfcILTkLiQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJX9wUqbToyqEPfcILTkLiQ	1	Ugzm8Q2-fEInBjcoxZF4AaABAg	Brian Tower

Also your second link had nothing in it with doctor christie, just a paper on figuring out the amount of carbon dioxide the dinosaurs had, which btw Has no actual proof that the warming was actually caused by the co2 emissions simply that the warming and co2 levels were related. Nothing to say that the warming is driving the co2 levels or vice versa Otherwise i wont challenge the statement before the link. I believe you Also my bad on the ground level temperature measurements, simply a statement i threw out there clearly you debunked me. Idk why you went on with the ppm levels since it takes 10000 ppm to cause slight dizziness to a human. Also i found no papers that relate carbon ppm levels to crop nutrients only that ground nutrients are also in some decline, nothing to do with co2. Also this only found in the main grain types which means there are different factors. The only study I did find was on rice but but they did not specify how much co2 was needed to reduce the chemical composition feel free to find some more papers on different grains i haven’t missed. Comparing cyanide and polonium to carbon dioxide is stupid since they are completely different your comparing vegetables to poison Not that i’m implying co2 is completely healthy in anyway. Anyway what carbon dioxide does to plants and nutrients is not what i’m here for and neither is the last few paragraphs since I do not care to argue them when i solely wish to talk on CO2 and CLIMATE. I have simply received temperature readings I have not yet received and answer on how .2 percent affects the other 99.8 percent to the point of our destruction. I still fail to see how co2 will completely eradicate our population and also have received no answer on the buggy climate models and the fearmongering they are producing. Even if the world slowly floods and the ocean level continues rising like they have for the PAST 20 000 YEARS i do not believe humans will sit on there asses and slowly drown to there death. Also rising temperatures does not highten or worsen natural disasters some studies show quite the opposite. The only one it might have any affect on is forest fires but australia is not burning because it’s 39 degrees instead of 38.

(holding infra-red thermal radiation (which would otherwise escape to the cold of space), warming the planet so life may proliferate)( & has some fertilizer effect) (without CO2 + Green House gases, Earth would be a Cold ROCK 0 degrees F.) This is the story of a little is good but a lot is deadly...consider Aspirin, for example. 1 Aspirin breaks a fever or a headache, an entire bottle may well kill you. The Goldilocks Level for humans of atmospheric CO2 has always been between 180ppm & 300ppm! OUR ENTIRE PHYSIOLOGY IS BASED ON THOSE NUMBERS 180ppm to 300ppm. We have no idea what increasing those gasses in our atmosphere will do to our grand Children's DNA. We have NEVER existed outside of these levels of atmospheric gasses. . Every Year a human has walked on Earth (hundreds of thousands of years) CO2 & other Gasses have ALWAYS been between 180ppm and 300ppm. 2. CO2 has boosted plant life on Earth provided the required Nutrients, Minerals & H2O increase in the exact proportion. Pernicious Invasive Species of weeds thrive with increased CO2, seemingly with any mix of nutrients, minerals & H2O.

I know the world is warming and i believe that humans influencing it to a degree I believe that we have warmed the earth anywhere in-between .1 and .5 degrees celsius, Now i will not deny satellite readings but i will deny ground data because of the bias it can hold Search some pictures of where they’re putting many of the heat sensors, urban areas, beside buildings, pavement etc. I will also deny the climate models since they are programmed to be extra sensitive to climate change I recall that there are at least 2 models that ipcc uses since the other (roughly) 90 other models failed. Ipcc and most government controlled models all show a drastic increase in temperatures... except Russia’s Also in there 300 page book on the models they wrote that models are unreliable. To say carbon dioxide or .2 percent of the atmosphere will be our end is absurd. The atmosphere is simply so large and carbon dioxide is simply an subtitle of a bigger system. From 1998 to 2012 there was little to no warming, says a statement from the ipcc. In conclusion saying that the world will end because of a degree is warming especially when a large portion of that is not our doing, fear mongering is dangerous and is stupid and that’s exactly whats happening. The second climate change turned into a political weapon it was corrupted and lost most credibility. Feel free to correct my facts especially the failure rate of past climate models.

The general mechanism is quite simple: we burn fossil fuels, this process releases ancient stored carbon dioxide (and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere), which traps & redirects IR heat (which is attempting to escape to the cold of Space as a cooling effect). There’s absolutely no doubt that the planet’s climate is getting hotter — decades’ worth of satellite & ground data clearly show . (Alexander von Humboldt coined the term and defined ' CLIMATE CHANGE ' in 1799) (Thomas Jefferson & John Adams discussed this changing climate from 1799 to 1804) (Science established human activities were causing these Global Climate Changes in 1811) . There’s Now Overwhelming evidence that points to human activity as the main culprit. While there are natural factors which can cause an equal and even greater impact, human activity is essentially a smoking gun here: the evidence indicates that all of this current global warming is caused by humans. . In this latest study, scientists carried out a statistical analysis of satellite climate data, identifying the anthropogenic fingerprints in climate change. . The analysis showed that humans are causing climate change to a confidence level of 5 sigma, the so-called gold standard of statistics — which translates a 99.9999% certainty. . In other words, there’s only a one-in-a-million chance that the pattern of atmospheric heating is not the result of human activity. . Science doesn’t really ever eliminate uncertainty — it just reduces it, and when the uncertainty reaches very low levels, then that’s essentially a scientific certainty. This isn’t the first study to strongly conclude that humans are causing climate change	UCt9UyYrv76HIRb_2mKix47g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt9UyYrv76HIRb_2mKix47g	1	Ugzm8Q2-fEInBjcoxZF4AaABAg	Brian Tower

The purpose of stopping climate change is not the effects on cold related deaths in america, but the effects on global agriculture and general wildlife. The &#39;solutions&#39; discussed in this report also strike a sour spot for me. I disagree with such solutions as &#39;building a net 0 emissions house&#39; for the same reasons you discussed. Instead I believe focus should be on the corporations who produce millions times more emissions than any single family home. Through renewable energies and other technologies which would predominantly affect these companies america specifically could greatly cut emissions and the layman like yourself wouldnt notice much at all.

(**) 5) What ever science there once was has been hijacked by socialists. 6) Grand Solar Minimum. 7) We've had ice ages with 4,500 ppm CO2, and warm periods with 200 ppm CO2; clearly CO2 is not the control knob on the earth's temperature. 8) Termites emit way more methane than cows. 9) Why have the ice caps on Mars melted? 10) Al Gore bought seaside property; he ain't worried. (*) Al Gore said in his movie, "If you ignore the effect of water vapor, CO2 is the most powerful greenhouse gas." This is like saying, "If you ignore that man with the machine gun, the guy with the pocket knife is the most dangerous man in the room." (**) and follow this up with the reason: plants lose water to gain CO2. The 100 ppm increase has made it so that instead of losing 100 water molecules for every CO2 the plant captures, it now only loses 84. The greening has turned up around the margins of deserts, and has nothing to do with humans planting anything.

There was some uncertainty as to whether aerosols would block solar irradiance and counter the warming effect of carbon dioxide and was quickly abandoned as a tenable hypothesis when temperatures continued to rise in the 80&#39;s.

Voice of reason!<br /><br /><a href="https://youtu.be/aFc3Kt_lZek">https://youtu.be/aFc3Kt_lZek</a><br /><br /><br />World&#39;s top climate scientists told to &#39;cover up&#39; the fact t azqhat the Earth&#39;s temperature hasn&#39;t risen for the last 15 years<br />By Tamara Cohen, Political Correspondent<br /><br />Scientists working on the most authoritative study on climate change were urged to cover up the fact that the world’s temperature hasn’t risen for the last 15 years, it is claimed.<br /><br />Scientists working on the most authoritative study on climate change were urged to cover up the fact that the world’s temperature hasn’t risen for the last 15 years, it is claimed.<br />A leaked copy of a United Nations report, compiled by hundreds of scientists, shows politicians in Belgium, Germany, Hungary and the United States raised concerns about the final draft.<br />Published next week, it is expected to address the fact that 1998 was the hottest year on record and world temperatures have not yet exceeded it, which scientists have so far struggled to explain.<br />The report is the result of six years’ work by UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which is seen as the world authority on the extent of climate change and what is causing it – on which governments including Britain’s base their green policies.<br />Concerns: Scientists have been urged to cover up the fact that the Earth&#39;s temperature hasn&#39;t risen for the last 15 years amid fears it would provide ammunition for deniers of man-made climate change<br />But leaked documents seen by the Associated Press, yesterday revealed deep concerns among politicians about a lack of global warming over the past few years.<br />Germany called for the references to the slowdown in warming to be deleted, saying looking at a time span of just 10 or 15 years was ‘misleading’ and they should focus on decades or centuries. The UN&#39;s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has changed its tune after issuing stern warnings about climate change for years<br />Hungary worried the report would provide ammunition for deniers of man-made climate change.<br />Belgium objected to using 1998 as a starting year for statistics, as it was exceptionally warm and makes the graph look flat - and suggested using 1999 or 2000 instead to give a more upward-pointing curve.<br />World&#39;s top climate scientists confess: Global warming is just QUARTER what we thought - and computers got the effects of greenhouse gases wrong<br /><br />Global warming will end life on earth (but don&#39;t panic, you&#39;ve got 3.5bn years left!)<br /><br />The United States delegation even weighed in, urging the authors of the report to explain away the lack of warming using the ‘leading hypothesis’ among scientists that the lower warming is down to more heat being absorbed by the ocean – which has got hotter.<br />The last IPCC ‘assessment report’ was published in 2007 and has been the subject of huge controversy after it had to correct the embarrassing claim that the Himalayas would melt by 2035.<br />It was then engulfed in the ‘Climategate’ scandal surrounding leaked emails allegedly showing scientists involved in it trying to manipulate their data to make it look more convincing – although several inquiries found no wrongdoing.<br />The latest report, which runs to 2,000 pages, will be shown to representatives from all 195 governments next week at a meeting in Stockholm, who can discuss alterations they want to make.<br /><br />But since it was issued to governments in June, they have raised hundreds of objections about the 20-page summary for policymakers, which sums up the findings of the scientists.<br />What it says will inform renewable energy policies and how much consumers and businesses will pay for them.<br />The report is expected to say the rate of warming between 1998 and 2012 was about half of the average rate since 1951 – and put this down to natural variations such as the El Nino and La Nina ocean cycles and the cooling effects of volcanoes.<br />A leaked copy of the United Nations report, compiled by hundreds of scientists, shows politicians in Belgium, Germany, Hungary and the United States have raised concerns about the final draft. Above, the United Nations headquarters building in New York<br />A German climate scientist - Stefan Rahmstorf, who reviewed the chapter on sea levels - yesterday admitted it was possible the report’s authors were feeling under pressure to address the slowdown in warming due to the ‘public debate’ around the issue.<br />The draft report, which is not new research but a synthesis of all the work being done by scientists around the world, is likely to be highly disputed at the three-day meeting.<br />It will make the case that humans are causing global warming with carbon emissions even more strongly upgrading it from ‘very likely’ in 2007 to ‘extremely likely’ it is manmade.<br />But scientists are under pressure to explain why the warming has not exceeded 1998 levels although the decade 2000-2010 was the hottest on record.<br />Alden Meyer, of the Union of Concerned Scientists based in Washington, said yesterday: ‘I think to not address it would be a problem because then you basically have the denialists saying: ‘Look the IPCC is silent on this issue.’<br />Jonathan Lynn, a spokesman for the IPCC said yesterday: ‘This is the culmination of four years’ work by hundreds of scientists, where governments get a chance to ensure the summary for policymakers is clear and concise in a dialogue with the scientists who wrote it, and have the opportunity to raise any topics they think should be highlighted.’<br /><br />Climate scientists told to &#39;cover up&#39; the fact that the Earth&#39;s temperature hasn&#39;t risen for the last 15 years<br /><br />The link<br /><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2425775/Climate-scientists-told-cover-fact-Earths-temperature-risen-15-years.html">https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2425775/Climate-scientists-told-cover-fact-Earths-temperature-risen-15-years.html</a><br /><br />Solar Minimum<br />. <br /><a href="https://youtu.be/UwttpF0_D1M">https://youtu.be/UwttpF0_D1M</a><br /><br /><br />Greenland ice sheet growing solar min<br /><br /><a href="https://youtu.be/4vjJtmYq6fM">https://youtu.be/4vjJtmYq6fM</a><br /><br /><br />CBN Greg Writestone<br /><a href="https://youtu.be/aSV21pPeF3g">https://youtu.be/aSV21pPeF3g</a><br /><br /><br />Alex Epstein phylospher on on climate<br /><a href="https://youtu.be/C7KIewLrEvA">https://youtu.be/C7KIewLrEvA</a><br /><br />Physics<br /><a href="https://youtu.be/SXxHfb66ZgM">https://youtu.be/SXxHfb66ZgM</a><br /><br /><a href="https://youtu.be/h7_yMuy2ip4">https://youtu.be/h7_yMuy2ip4</a><br /><br /><a href="https://youtu.be/mtHreJbr2WM">https://youtu.be/mtHreJbr2WM</a><br /><br />Bastardi specializes in understanding the history of weather and climate and said he used this understanding to accurately predict both Hurricane Sandy and Hurricane Arthur ahead of official warnings. In contrast, he said  alarmists “don’t know what happened yesterday” or “know anything about what happened in the past.”<br />As Bastardi pointed out, he has to make accurate predictions in order to be paid and has no political motivation.<br />Bastardi asserted that alarmist scientists cannot actually be objective, because they are given grants explicitly to study global warming. He called upon alarmists to answer just one question. “What would it take for you to change? What do you need to see?” If this question cannot be answered, he argued, then there is nothing empirical behind their arguments that man is causing catastrophic climate change.<br />Addressing the science, Bastardi noted the entire world only adds 1.8 ppm of CO2 in a year, he called the notion that this miniscule amount causes extreme weather “ludicrous.” Instead, he said alarmists are just “taking every weather event they can find” and connecting it to climate change. He urged people to ask themselves if they believe that amount of carbon dioxide could have the impact that climate alarmists claim it does.<br />He also criticized the so-called consensus of alarm among climate scientists, saying “it is easy to have consensus when someone will pay you to have one.” Bastardi was very firm in the belief that the climate movement was “not about science” but had become a movement “from people who make profits” off the hysteria.<br />In his view, the alarmists’ goal was the “restructuring of the way our society works,” and the consequences if their economic recommendations are adopted are “suicide for our way of life.” Furthermore, he pointed out that the United States alone cannot make an impact on global emissions, as it releases only 10 percent of the world’s carbon dioxide. He joked “What are we going to do? Go to war with the rest of the globe [and force them to cut emissions]?”<br /><br />Climate Bistardi Stosell<br />Ivar Giaever ,1972 Nobel <br /><a href="https://youtu.be/SXxHfb66ZgMi">https://youtu.be/SXxHfb66ZgMi</a><br /><br /><br />The link<br /><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2425775/Climate-scientists-told-cover-fact-Earths-temperature-risen-15-years.html">https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2425775/Climate-scientists-told-cover-fact-Earths-temperature-risen-15-years.html</a><br /><br />Solar Minimum<br />. <br /><a href="https://youtu.be/UwttpF0_D1M">https://youtu.be/UwttpF0_D1M</a><br /><br />Greenland ice sheet growing solar min<br /><a href="https://youtu.be/4vjJtmYq6fM">https://youtu.be/4vjJtmYq6fM</a><br /><br /><br />CBN Greg Writestone<br /><a href="https://youtu.be/aSV21pPeF3g">https://youtu.be/aSV21pPeF3g</a><br /><br /><br />Alex Epstein phylospher on on climate<br /><a href="https://youtu.be/C7KIewLrEvA">https://youtu.be/C7KIewLrEvA</a><br /><br />Physics<br /><a href="https://youtu.be/SXxHfb66ZgM">https://youtu.be/SXxHfb66ZgM</a><br /><br /><a href="https://youtu.be/h7_yMuy2ip4">https://youtu.be/h7_yMuy2ip4</a><br /><br /><a href="https://youtu.be/mtHreJbr2WM">https://youtu.be/mtHreJbr2WM</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Climate change ahhh NO!<br /><br /><a href="https://youtu.be/lxVoZDGluLs">https://youtu.be/lxVoZDGluLs</a>	UC8A9oLCku6Nl61zMOxVRorw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8A9oLCku6Nl61zMOxVRorw	0

Most people don&#39;t even understand the difference between climate and weather. Yes it is true that climate change is a natural ongoing process. It is also true that the level of C02 in the atmosphere continues to rise and we now know what effects that will have on climate and weather. The increase in greenhouse gasses (not just CO2) is facilitating an unprecedented change in the rate of climate change. Weather can vary, but a warmer world will have more extreme weather events and more intense weather. We can see this happening. Storms are becoming bigger and more intense. Dry areas are becoming drier. Wet areas wetter. The arctic and the antarctic are warming fastest of all that affects temperature gradients worldwide that power air and ocean currents. Did you know the Jetstream is weakening? So is the Gulfstream. If this trend continues, the effect on weather will be drastic.<br />Sticking your heads in the sand will not change reality. Mother Nature doesn&#39;t care about politics.	UC4EdsPuTsxdmt_WKd55xcfw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4EdsPuTsxdmt_WKd55xcfw	0

Humans create CO2 which is a poison not used by trees to live 3. We have a switch 4. China and India and creating 1500 new power stations in the next five years increasing CO2 probably 100% 5. This will increase temps 100% 6. Polar ice caps will melt causing 4m sea level increase in the next 12 years Surprised i remembered all your theories. Any im wrong on just tell me. So this will he easy right. You are using M Mann hockey stick I can see it already. So lets revisit sea levels every year next five to ten years. And temps of course. Then we see whos theory is closest to reality. My prediction. 1. Weather is cyclical 2. Earth getting greener 3. Temps wont change number of all time max and min temos reached will average - zero - proxy will be USA state record temps 50 states Europe countries records 55 states and Australian states and territories seven as our proxy. In case you need to check One new record high and one new record low would be zero change. And visa versa 4. Sea levels wont rise ( Sydney amd NYC tide giages as our proxies) Next year we return to discuss our findings like scientists concerned for the future - whoever wins can tell everyone and I personally will happily concede there is global warming if your right. I presume your sea level is linear so 10 yesrs is 40cm though where it has some compounding tendancies we can simply half the reading so 20cm by next year. Temps for you doubling in 5 years will be ok but we will need to make it linear :)	UChA13YUng0AhvYlGGp28-gg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UChA13YUng0AhvYlGGp28-gg	1	Ugzbv3YurvRpcYT4RI14AaABAg	David O'Connell

The PH level in the ocean has been steadily dropping, no one said its going to become "acidic", its becoming less alkaline (same as more acidic), so its worse for corals and crustaceans, its already had major impacts. So how long is it gonna take for your basalt rock "to equalize", why is it not "equalizing", why is PH level still dropping? Nothing you are saying is coming from scientific sources, everything you are saying goes against established peer-reviewed science, fucking flat earther. You know that "biggest explosion of life" occurs during span of hundreds of thousands of years or millions? You dont have that kind of time to observe that.

Then the cambrian era with 20 times more CO2 in the atmosphere had the biggest explosion of life in the sea ever.

Climate science have nothing to do with al gore or IPCC, they dont do science, scientists all over the world do. It doesnt matter whether its Europe, Japan, Russia, China - they all say the same thing. You should really stay silent as ignorant as you are. You are listening to shills funded by oil industry, who have no expertise and no credibility in science. Plants are part of eco system, so it means it can boost growth of some plants more than others, and prevents growth of other plants (by reducing sunlight and taking away resources), its even worse with the ocean as there is problem of Ocean Acidification - ocean absorbs more CO2 than all the plants on the land in the world combined. At this point you may as well be flat earther, how anti-science and anti-intellectual you are.

You are horribly misinformed by denier, so you are a denier yourself. Its not greener anywhere, some plants may benefit from CO2, but some may not. Its not that simple, and plants will never absorb more CO2 than it increases - otherwise CO2 concentration wouldnt increase moron. You are speaking nonsense. All recent years were hottest years on record and next year will be one of the hottest years on record, no it wasnt hotter 50 years ago. You are delusional.

Next it will be read up on all the religions and tell me you dont believe they exist. Nice one - love it - legendary. Next ill read about cars before using one- yeah totally - or perhaps ill read up on food tech before eating- man theres 40k scientists who supoort AOC who says we have 12 years left. There are scientists who create models which spit out lies about warming temps using more than 70% model temps - well fancy that the temp is higher when you use models- models make whatever you want them to say. Fancy the same scientists saying its hotter now when all actual temps are lower. Stunning! I had another guy tell me the last six years were the hottest ever - we went through actual data and he was shocked that there aren't any temp records proving it just fake models. Of course he had a meltdown abiut science magazines and journals yawn yawn. Or what about people who want to publish who are denied cause they say the numbers don't stack up. Whats that all about. Or those that publish which are clearly lies like M Mann Hockey stick or Global warming itself - we all know its fake - even the scientists know it so they changed the name to climate change - might as well call it day change or time change or cyclical cause the phrase means as much. Why change the name unless its not getting warmer every year. Why not explain you lied and made it up or your theory is phony baloney and now you have a new one. Which paper says that. Show me which one. There won't be that it many saying that will there. Wheres the paper saying Al Gores prediction about Maldives being under water is false or the retraction. Nooo nothing like this. Huh - you see you only get one side if your onoy allowed to tell one side and thats the problem with global warmkng science - everyone knows its biased toward explaining the world will end to ensure more funding. Why else would you recieve funding. Huh - dont be part of the fakery. Think for yourself- yiur parroting what the whole fake news says and politicians and big corporate who want you to believe it so they can take control. You are allowing it withiut realising - the whole global warming agenda comes from marxist sympathisers who want authoritarianism and totalitarianism gaining control of every aspect of your life - dont allow the fakery to seap into your veins - you are better than that.

You are simply part of the desperate who want to support fake news with you lunacy. Then you hide inside all winter crying about global warming. You dont think for yourself. Your simply a mouthpiece for the large corporates and the marxists who want to take over the world. Only someone who thinks for themselves realises that what is being said is fake. People like Trump NASA scientists who took us to the moon, willie soon, Tony Heller - Alan Jones - Amdrew Bolt, Tucker Carlson, Dan Pena - people who arent part of the fake structure who want to control the people. You want to destroy thr world with mad policies. You cant operate without fossil feuls - you are deluded and you can go sleep under a tree and wear sunscreen duringthe winter while all the real practical people do what they always do and go skiing in the winter. Dont wear a jumper tomorrow see how that works out for you. Will be awesome if you can. Report back to me. You have a magic switch to turn on the heat so lets see how it goes. Then lets predict temp for next uear and sea levels for next year- you think AOC and 12 years is left like 40000 other scientists and I believe there's nothing to fear - Im not scared shivering under the carpet - whimpering and smelling like a marxist crackpot.

Sure that doesnt end human civilization, but millions would die, mass starvation, mass poverty, trillions of dollars in losses, mass migration. Ocean acidification threatens food supply from the ocean. Reducing impact of climate change costs less in a long run than mitigating consequences in future.

I completely grant that there is a possibility that climate change will not be as severe as we think it will be. No one is predicting that the world will end in 10 years. However, it is objectively true that CO2 is correlated with climate. Disputing that proves that you only look at biased sources because it is a scientific fact. It is a fact that Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system even though it is farther from the Sun than Mercury. The reason for this is the greenhouse effect, as as Venus has a thick atmosphere and Mercury has a thin atmosphere. Look it up, it is objectively true. Without greenhouse gases, the Earth would get super cold at night just like the moon. How do you propose that the Earth maintains a more steady temperature than the moon while both bodies are roughly the same distance from the Sun?

The phenomenon is known as the Greenhouse effect. Visible light is about to pass through CO2, but infrared light cannot (this is the type of light that normally escapes into space). This means that infrared light cannot escape into space, so it is reflected back onto the surface. Since light is a form of energy, the surface temperature of the Earth will increase when energy remains on the surface due to the second law of thermodynamics. I am a science education major, but I assure you that this is very basic science. This is how greenhouses work (but with glass). It is also why your car gets hot on the inside on a summer day.

We've had much higher amounts in the atmosphere historically with little to no changes in temperature. What percentage if any is attributable to humans has never been accurately calculated. All thats known is we dont know and this is due to the variance being so small is below statistical error rates.

Almost all scientific research into the climate predicts that this will have very negative consequences, however I will admit that the extent of these consequences is currently unknown. A thing is not false just because it does not align with your world view. If you did any unbiased scientific research into academic climate science change, you would have to conclude that climate change is a serious threat even if the extent of that threat is not known. I am a science major at college, so I have met many scientists. Every single one of them views climate change as a real threat. If you cannot trust experts, then you might as well be a flat-earther.

You have billions of poor, broke, uneducated people with 5 kids in many countries who can&#39;t feed their families and they don&#39;t care a bit about this issue. And expecting them to change their lives is completely hopeless. I once saw a TV documentary about Russia. There was a small town, where they had a big, old steel factory. This place pumped out so much poison daily, the townspeople were told not to exercise outside and avoid taking deep breaths. The trees were devoid of leaves, the lakes had fish with 3 eyeballs and hands instead of fins, some 95% of pregnancies resulted in miscarriages, and when they interviewed the towns people, they said in broken English, &quot;What we going to do, company gives us jobs&quot;. People won&#39;t risk their livelihoods to save the planet, they expect others to do this for us...and I&#39;m driving my SUV and never recycled in my life...

Life was in abundance , more than life today with the earth surface overflowing with plant life and animals .co2 builds plant life , its all part of the circle of life .

Right-Wing Heartland Institute was sued for the FAKE COVER....lost the suit and signed a consent decree...but not before they sent copies to nearly 100 right-wing blogs...to keep the lie alive. ***** ***** Vaughan Pratt, Professor (Emeritus since 2000) at Stanford University (1981-present) Dec 22, 2017 Which factor is swiftly changing the earth's climate? Well, one often-mentioned factor is CO2. Over the past millennium this graph, most of which is obtained from Antarctic/Greenland ice cores, shows CO2 holding steady at 280 ± 5 ppm up to 1800, when the global population was about a billion people and sailing ships and the horse-and-buggy were the most advanced forms of transportation, consuming relatively little energy per capita compared with today. Since then Earths’ population has grown to seven billion people, each consuming an order of magnitude more energy than back then, almost entirely by burning carbon-based fuels and releasing the resulting CO2 into the atmosphere as by far the most convenient place to put it. In the late 1700s Swiss polymath and alpinist Horace de Saussure was puzzled by why mountains were much colder at the top, despite being closer to the Sun and having less atmosphere between them and the Sun. It was well known at the time that glass tended to trap heat from the Sun, so de Saussure speculated that the atmosphere was trapping heat similar to the way glass does. To confirm the heat-trapping ability of glass de Saussure built a nested stack of boxes each with a glass window at the top. . He found that successively deeper boxes were hotter, with the innermost one hot enough to cook the fruit. In 1826 Joseph Fourier published a book in which he calculated that without de Saussure’s heating mechanism as applied to the atmosphere there was not enough heat from the Sun to prevent the oceans from freezing over. In the 1850s Irish physicist, John Tyndall invented this gadget. It allowed him to measure the heat-absorbing properties of gases placed in the long tube at top center. He found that gases and vapors whose molecules had three or more atoms, such as water vapor and CO2, absorbed much more of the thermal radiation passing through the tube than did two-atom molecules such as oxygen and nitrogen. He concluded that the water vapor in the atmosphere was responsible for the heat-trapping effect that de Saussure had guessed at and that Fourier had shown was necessary to keep the oceans from freezing over. In 1878 American astronomer Samuel Langley, who later founded the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, invented the bolometer, an extremely the sensitive infrared thermometer that could detect the warmth of “a cow quarter of a mile away”. In 1896 Swedish chemist and Nobel laureate Svante Arrhenius used Langley’s bolometer to measure the heat from the Moon at various altitudes above the horizon in order to estimate the dependence of atmospheric heat-trapping on the amount of water vapor and CO2 along the line of sight to the Moon, a much longer path near the horizon than at 45 degrees. Subtracting the expected influence of water vapor gave him that of CO2. From these measurements he concluded empirically that each doubling of CO2 trapped about the same amount of heat, though without offering any explanation of why the dependency on concentration should be logarithmic as opposed to say the square root. (Today we can see from the HITRAN tables for CO2 absorption lines that each doubling of CO2 brings 60–80 more lines into play, each line blocking about the same small amount of atmospheric window to space.) ((tens of thousands of samplings of CO2 all around the world, test ISOTOPES & that CLEARLY Proves that the dramatic increase in CO2 comes from BURNING FOSSIL FUELS. That is a distinct test ))) But why CO2 and not water vapor? . Well, Arrhenius’s interest was in the much higher temperatures of a hundred million years ago that some geologists of the time were claiming. Knowing that water vapor could not change much due to the Clausius-Clapeyron relation, he reasoned that the next candidate in line for significant heat-trapping ability must be CO2 and that it must have been much higher back then. His fellow Swede, physicist Anders Ångström, disputed Arrhenius’s theory on the ground that the absorption bands would have saturated well before reaching that level, but what neither Swede knew back then was that CO2 had more than 30,000 absorption lines most at strengths insufficient to play any role until CO2 had reached far higher than the 6000 ppm of a hundred million years ago. . None of this history is in dispute today in scientific circles, other than by a very few scientists who reject the idea that if CO2 continues along the trajectory in the first graph above, by 2100 considerable damage will have been done both to the biosphere and to coastal real estate valuations. ** "Is CO2 harmful to humans? Most people don’t realize that CO2 is a highly toxic substance that has associated (along with CH4 and NO) during the five mass extinctions of the past. The key question isn’t whether CO2 is toxic to humans (or plants and animals in general) but rather if the rate of change in atmospheric CO2 is toxic..." * Human-Caused Global Warming — OSS Foundation ossfoundation.us/projects/environment/global-warming/human-caused How do we know current global warming is human-caused, or man-made? Is global warming real, or a hoax? Consider the facts: the climate system is indicated to have left the natural cycle path; multiple lines of evidence and studies from different fields all point to the human fingerprint on current climate change A UNIQUE ISOTOPE of CO2 clearly shows HUMAN CAUSATION! *** https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-whats-warming-the-world/	UCt9UyYrv76HIRb_2mKix47g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt9UyYrv76HIRb_2mKix47g	1	Ugwd_ziJoZLTr2Iq5MB4AaABAg	Gregory Sell

Alexander von Humboldt Coined the Term "Climate Change" in 1799 and he defined the term precisely the way it is used today. Thomas Jefferson and John Adams discussed Climate Change from 1799 thru 1804. <------------------------------ It was determined to be related To ATMOSPHERIC gases and their interaction with Solar Radiation by 1856, Foote. In the late 1800s, scientists determined that Atmospheric Gases were holding solar heat and this was termed GLOBAL WARMING. . The last major global warming trend occurred when the last great Ice Age (glaciation) ended between 15,000 and 10,000 years ago: this was a warming of about 5°C over 5,000 years, that is a rate of only 0.1°C per century. . (( NOTED SKEPTIC Satellite/Climatologist, Dr. John Christy recently admitted that SINCE 11/1978, temperatures have increased **** EVERY DECADE***** at a century pace of 1.4 C/100 years! {0.14C each-and- every decade since 1978} ...note, That admission Eliminates the Pro-Fossil-Fuel Global-Warming "Pause", "Hiatus", sure as hell killed off Global "Cooling".} . We're warming 14 times faster than plants/animals are readily able to evolve or adapt to. )) . The expected magnitude and rate of planetary warming is highly likely to come with major risks and impacts in terms of sea-level rise (Pliocene sea level was 25–35 meters higher than now, due to smaller Greenland & Antarctic ice sheets), extreme Weather Events {flooding Rains, heavy Snows, high Winds} (for example, hurricane activity is expected to increase in a warmer climate ---hurricane activity has been INCREASING for decades), and ecosystem loss. . The second part of this paper examined the evidence for the current warming of the planet and discussed what is known about its causes. This part showed that global warming is already a measured and well-established fact, NOT a THEORY. . Many different lines of evidence Consistently show that most of the observed warming of the past fifty years was caused by human activity. . (( EVERY YEAR in the 21st Century has been a RECORD-SETTING HOT YEAR. )) Above all, this warming is exactly what would be expected given the anthropogenic rise in greenhouse gases, and no viable alternative explanation for this warming has been proposed in the scientific literature (( by any Contrarian, Skeptic, or Denier )). Taken together, the very strong evidence, accumulated from thousands of independent studies, has over the past decades convinced virtually every climatologist around the world (many of whom were initially quite skeptical, including myself ) that anthropogenic global warming is a reality with which we need to deal with) ...." https://www.dw.com/image/43195385_401.png	UCt9UyYrv76HIRb_2mKix47g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt9UyYrv76HIRb_2mKix47g	1	Ugwd_ziJoZLTr2Iq5MB4AaABAg	Gregory Sell

I remember it well. Those scientists were wrong. I have yet to hear anyone account for why temperatures plunged during the Little Ice Age, and successfully link that to global warming. The earth has been going through heating and cooling cycles as long as it has existed.

I did my best to break the spell for several months. Now, I am done with it. My family lives in a high altitude, cold climate region.

I listened to a couple, but found them unconvincing and obnoxious. He mocks people like Patrick Moore and Dennis Prager--who are far more intelligent and more educated than he is. These kind of remarks are one reason why his speeches cause me to cringe. I checked a couple of his citations and found them to be nonprofessional and propagandising script. So, in all honesty, I find him unconvincing. And yes, I saw the arguments between he and Tony Heller. And no matter how well an argument is presented, I am much more influenced by evidence. Both of these guys have only 4 year degrees in geology. Still, Tony Heller relies heavily on historical evidence. I like this approach.

I have provided numorous citations and much annecdotal evidence. While this had been very time consuming, in response, all I have received are emotion based answers with no real substance. As yet, you have not provided any evidence to undermine my perspective. If you want the specific evidence that you are asking for, reread my comments or watch a few Tony Heller YouTube videos. He has done a good job debunking the modern graphs for novice consideration. He utilizes historical newspapers and magazine articles as well as published scientific data to show trends in actual climate. He does extensive comparisons to demonstrate the folly of modern climate "science". I am currently involved in other matters and have little hope of quelling the unchecked paranoia of the masses. Arguing against the supposed climate crises is like trying to undermine the love of socialism amoung the deluded American youth. The incessant propaganda from our leftist media, universities and Hollywood have effectively rendered these issues into purely emotional arguments. Have you noticed the relatively few citations provided to support the climate hysteria prominent in this thread? Of those few provided, nearly all are weak at best. Most, do not support the arguments to which they are assigned. So, please save your pompous emotional retorts for your young friends. My generation was forged in critical thinking proved with evidence--not smug indifference to reality. And, no, I am not triggered. Rather, I've lost interest in trying to uplift the zombie masses from their TV induced hysteria. It would be rather difficult to convey my disinterest in a more friendly manner.

The ones being produced over the last decade or so are deceiving in a number of ways: 1. Graphs cut off at certain point in the ebb and flow of cycles to produce an illusion of global warming, seasonal ice melt and sea level rise. 2. Graphs that show revised levels from the past and 3. Reports of flooding, storms, fires, droughts, etc that demonstrate that these occurrences are actually less numorous than in the past. Finally, most climate hysteria is reported by propagandists--not by scientists. And, so what if many or most of the scientists that I have mentioned have YouTube videos. I looked these up to help convey the reality of climate propaganda with easily accessible evidence. So, other than your own sense of personal genius, what evidence do you provide to dismiss my perspective? By the way; nearly all of the experts that I cited are world renowned scientists who are not receiving grants from from the UN. Now that the UN is broke, the hysteria will start to die down. What force will be needed to stall your bloated ego? How about the force of time? Eventually you will grow up.

He said that there are about a dozen weather stations in the populated part of canada and only one in the northern regions. So the collected data definetly falls short there. Then, the temperature data over the vast streches of ocean must be far from complete, as well. There is no way that these scientists can credibly claim to know the average temperature on earth--today or any time in the past. So they estimate. In one of Dr Patrick Moore's youtube videos, he showed that CO2 levels have been falling for millions of years, dropping to dangerously low levels (270 ppm) in about the year 1700. What is presented publically is a small upward trend beginning in the 1700's. The levels have been much higher than 420 ppm for most of geological time--including during the many known ice ages (proving that there is no corralation between CO2 and temperature). They are getting the results that they are paid to get. They are not doing science. They are doing politics.

Neither is Christina Nunez, the author of that National Geographic artical that you sent. That artical even had a photo of a house about five feet under water. That photo does not actually represent sea level rise, as implied. It represents flood--which is common even inland. Also, She repeated one of my assertions: the current rate of sea level rise is about 3 mm per year. But I will locate a chart for you that shows the rise and fall levels going back about 800 years. My graph could be wrong. So could hers. It seems the many independant researcers are all over the place in their interpretation of data. The markings on the piers in S. Florida do not agree with her levels. Moreover, local banks are still funding quite a bit of new construction near the ocean front. So, I am clearly not alone in my perspective.

Currently the oceans are rising at an average rate of only 3mm per year. I agree, but the ocean level rises and falls periodically; and it takes a long time to heat up the oceans. That one degree is showing no discernible difference. Remember Al Gore's claim? "Miami will be under water by 2020"? The ocean has not raised noticably in Southern Florida in those thirty five years. All the pier markers appear to be at the same level--so does highway 75. The houses and structures built near sea level do not appear to be in any greater peril then they were 25 years ago. Still, thank you for finally making some argument--even if it is nothing more than propaganda. I can't blame you for falling for the big scare. Even NASA is reporting similiar false information. Of course NASA was the primary agent claiming the start of the global ice age and ozone depletion about 30 years ago. That is why it is necessary to read books--as opposed to articles in known propaganda supporting media. You need the bigger picture, not just random claims. I admit that by your finally providing something (anything) your effort has provided an upgrade in my oppinion of you. Insults don't bother me as I dish them out myself; but substance matters.

Like the mini ice ages, the drop in CO2 over millions of years, the slowly accumulated 6 inch rise in ocean depth over 800 years...the continous change in climate... All of these facts agreed on even by most propagandists. But, they are very quick to present historical graphs that start at some low point on a larger graph in order to falsely demonstrate inaccurate trends like rising CO2 levels, temperature and ocean levels....My main point was that man made CO2 emissions have had insignificant effect on global climate; and, with a single degree claimed rise in temperature over a century, there is no reason to be living in fear about climate. In reality, nature is not constant. Levels of water, temperature and CO2 go up and down over time. Despite your arrogant provocation, I provided all of the authors on which I stake my claim, and explained my perspective in relative depth and detail. I didn't provide MLA format and cite titles and pages because that requires more time and effort than I have to offer. My knowledge is gleaned from decades of critical awareness, videos and books--not merely a recent study. You made a big deal in disagreeing so strenuously about my singular claim that one degree is not an issue. Yet you have not provided any evidence to the contrary. Instead you are insisting that you know better because of how well-read you are. That claim is about as shallow an argument as anyone can make. But, I am not offended by people who fall for and lie about the propaganda. Millions of others do the same. Like you, they provide no argument--not even for the claims that they pretend to defend. So, I shake my head and keep it moving, realizing that most of the American youth (and too many modern, far left democrats) are dull minded and without critical resources. No problem, the Western world is now rapidly moving back toward the right. And globalism is near it's end. So you idiots are becomming less and less relevant. I was expecting that you would get mad during the course of our dialoque. And, it appears that in the very least, you are not particularly hot headed. Good on you for that. Always a pleasure to dialoque with someone who disagrees. Would have been better, though, if you were able to make a single argument above the claim about how well-read you are. If you believe that you have proven some point, why not share this dialoque with others. See if anyone thinks that you know anything at all.

This is known as the Dunning Kruger effect (the dumber the person, the smarter he/she perceives self) Have you read or seen videos by Dr William Happer or Dr Tim Ball? I have. Both are easy to find on youtube. What brilliant climate scientist have you read? I read Al Gore's book. None of his predictions have matterialized, nor are matterializing. Why do you suppose he received a Nobel Peace Prize? Answer: to support propaganda. I suspect that, like so many other "climate experts", you got your "science" from TV or dogmatic publications--not science literature. Not sure why I thought of Dr Moore as the founder; I see from google that he was president--not founder. I am far from an expert on climate. But the claims made by climate franatics generally seem completely unscientific; for instance: "97% of published climate scientists agree" and "past the tipping point with CO2 concentration" and by 2020 Miami will be under water" and "the sea ice is melting" etc.... These are all untrue and unscientific statements that seem to be effecting a large number of people who get 97% of their "facts" from the news. And, I don't know if you are old enough to remember, NASA and TV "news" were predicting the start of a global iceage, acid rain and ozone depletion only about 30 years ago or so. All turned out to be wrong. Do you not know that the globalist movement is behind the climate scare? And have you not noticed that Western nations are constantly told that without governmental takeover we are nearing Armageddon? This tactic is called the Heglian Dialectic. This control tactic is not something that you or anyone should remain ignorent about. When I was very young, it was the threat of Communism, then nuclear annihilation, then the ozone layer and acid rain, then global cooling, now global warming or catastrophic climate change.... Finally, "one degree claimed rise in temperature over the previous century" means catastrophic ocean rise. There is significant information to consider: Have you read that algee was found under the ice in the North Pole? Are you aware that climate scientists also claim that the temperture on the four inner planets have rison over the past century? Do you recall that Europe suffered an ice age beginning in the last part of the 16th century? Have you read about "the little ice age" in North America. beginning in around 1300 and lasting a few hundred years? Do you know anything at all about solar cycles--particularly the Sun Spot cycle? Do you know that CO2 concentrations were much higher in the past then they are now? In fact, CO2 concentrations have been dropping for millions of years. The point is that weather and climate has been changing since the formation of the planet. There is simply no reason to panic.

For instance it can be 90°f in Chicago or it can be -10°f a few months later. Stan you are thinking with your emotions rather than with reason. You are drunk on the coolaid. Read a book or two on the subject. I recommend Dr Patrick Moore, the founder of Greenpeace. Many thousands of people die every year due to cold and lack of heating fuel. Only a hand full die from too much heat. The earth has been slowly heating up since the last ice age. The oceans have rison about 6 inches during the last 800 years. There is no need for alarm. About 500 climate scientists sent their consensus to the UN about 2 weeks ago. They say that the climate alarmist are full of beans. You, my friend are simply not informed.

The Navy has been measuring the thickness of the Arctic and Antarctic Ice for well over 50 years. The reason is nuclear submarines operate under the polar caps, and they have to know if they can surface in case of an emergency. Submarines use SONAR to measure the thickness and report it along with their exact position and a constantly changing ice map is produced.  Unless you think that DoD and the Pentagon are biased. <br /><br />Also, we are having a hurricane in mid-July, which is rare because usually the sea water is not warm enough and there is not enough moisture. &quot;June too soon, July too dry&quot; But as of today 07/13/19, the Mississippi River has been above flood stage for 10 days. <br /><br />It could very well be cyclical, but no one can say that for sure.

For starters, the very article that you linked states that there is some disagreement about wether the hottest temperature was accurately recorded, and that the actual hottest day may have taken place in 2013. Of course, none of this matters at all because one hot day does not disprove climate change. On average, the Earth is hotter than it was 100 years ago.

But to single out Global Warming as the end and must immediately change the world for our very survival is a little over the top. Science is not absolutely sure if this will happen but says it could. There is other science that disputes this claim saying the models are incorrect because of actual data. There definitely is a warming trend but it’s not totally abnormal for earth to do this kind of thing and we may not be the biggest factor causing it. I do agree that money must be put into alternative energy sources and clean up the energy sources we use many oil. The simplest way of dealing with high carbon is to increase plant life across the whole earth.	UCEWfYOWClSZExHG3BsN58tg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEWfYOWClSZExHG3BsN58tg	0

I&#39;m one of  the 99.99% of scientists who didn&#39;t major in climatology. And thus I don&#39;t have an agenda or a bias based on what result some funding body would like me to support nor which peer reviewed papers get accepted and published. <br />What I am capable of doing is reading Abstracts and making an informed judgement on data and then assess models that reveal changing patterns. I don&#39;t have a bias to cherry pick models that claim to support CO2 culpable climate change and reject others. I dont agree that Correlation proves causation. E.g. We hear from WFS that deforestation has resulted in removal of 40% of the world&#39;s natural CO2 scavenger. Without photosynthesis (CO2, water and heat) as the  natural driver of the carbon cycle, we would be a desolate lifeless wasteland!! <br />Why doesn&#39;t the alarmist want to discuss volcanism, sunspot activity wild fires, deforestation, logging and the urban sprawl? Which I&#39;m told contributes 8x the amount of atmospheric CO2 as fossil fuel. Conclusion: the only evidence I can discover about CO2 effecting life is that a rise of 300ppm would  produce crop yields like grain and rice that are between 30 and 250% greater.

CO2 has been going up for a hundred years and temperature has been going up for forty years. Go ahead and ignore the temperature decline from 1940 through 1980, and you can ignore the increase in temperature increase through the 1930's. It's okay, because Michael Mann's graph does away with these, as well as the little ice age and the mid evil warm period. Never mind the facts. You say CO2 is going up drastically over the past hundred years knowing full well that correlation does not equal causation. You've seen the graphs that show a correlation between increased ice-cream purchases and shark attacks? Therefor if you ban ice-cream you'll save people from shark attacks!

You mean the satellite data that says the seas are rising at 100 inches per century while the tide gauge data says it's been steady at 4 inches per century since 1865? At the end of the "little ice age"? Yep. Nothing suspicious about the satellite data; we should believe that rather than hundreds of sites here on earth still taking measurements, still saying nothing is different here on earth. We should believe people paid billions of dollars to prove global warming and sea level rise. We should believe Obama when he says "Global warming is serious; we need to pass laws and increase taxes." and then he buys a seaside mansion. (he might as well have said, "Do as I say, not as I do.") Well, yes; the temperature is going up. And CO2 is going up. It doesn't mean they have anything to do with each other. It's correlation, not causation. The only way to cool the earth is to install a Planetary Air Conditioner. I've done that. Figured out how much heat "global warming" um, "Climate Change" um, "CLIMATE EMERGENCY!" yeah; that's the ticket! ratchet up the rhetoric to fan up the fear! I figured out how much heat has been added, divided that by 7 billion people, and that's my fair share. For a one time charge of $100 I added enough cold to the environment to offset the heat of ten people. I did it five years ago, it's still working, and it still draws zero power from the electric company. And the US government is trying to pass a "Carbon Neutral Tax" that will add $1,300 per person in taxes per year, every year. (*) Global warming was a scam. It was the same nonsense as the Nigerian "You'll get a million dollars for helping me, but you need to send me $200 first." It's still a scam under it's new names. As a final thought, I've a degree in physics; numbers don't scare me. Please don't call me an ignorant idiot, a shill for big oil, a delusional head in the sand fool, or any of the other standard slanders that climate alarmists use when faced with facts that disprove their narrative. Please do me the honor of coming up with something new and original. Have a marvelous day. (*) The Carbon Neutral Tax (called Neutral because it is revenue neutral to the government) pulls $440 billion dollars a year from oil/CH4/ coal producers, and they pass the tax on to their customers (gasoline, diesel, food, heating, electric, plastic, roads, and roofs, to name a few). People each get a $1,300 check from the government. This means half the population will vote for it because they come out ahead (called buying votes if you're pragmatic, or socialist redistribution if you lean that way). The rebate is taxable as income; the government comes out $110 billion ahead on the Carbon "Neutral" Tax, and they say "Neutral" with a straight face. Undocumented immigrants cannot apply for a tax refund; add another $25 billion to the governments coffers on their behalf.

To be ordained as a minister you need to publish something proving climate change. As an ordained minister you are allowed to pontificate and collect tithes. If you want to piss off a minister of climatology, or one of the myopic minions, try any of the following... 1) say "CO2 is plant food." 2) say "Polar bears are thriving." 3) say "water vapor is a vastly more important green house gas, and it's wider infrared absorption bands already cover CO2's narrow bands.(*) 4) The earth is 15% greener now than when satellites first started taking pictures. (**) 5) What ever science there once was has been hijacked by socialists. 6) Grand Solar Minimum. 7) We've had ice ages with 4,500 ppm CO2, and warm periods with 200 ppm CO2; clearly CO2 is not the control knob on the earth's temperature. 8) Termites emit way more methane than cows. 9) Why have the ice caps on Mars melted? 10) Al Gore bought seaside property; he ain't worried. (*) Al Gore said in his movie, "If you ignore the effect of water vapor, CO2 is the most powerful greenhouse gas." This is like saying, "If you ignore that man with the machine gun, the guy with the pocket knife is the most dangerous man in the room." (**) and follow this up with the reason: plants lose water to gain CO2. The 100 ppm increase has made it so that instead of losing 100 water molecules for every CO2 the plant captures, it now only loses 84. The greening has turned up around the margins of deserts, and has nothing to do with humans planting anything.

It&#39;s focus and blanket denial is aimed to stop any discussion of over population or pollution effects. It helps stop further conversation on any other global problems like over fishing or plastics accumulation in the oceans by blanket denial of any human effect at all. Nearly every city on a coast line barges their garbage &quot;out to sea&quot;...as if that gets rid of it. Plastic in the oceans are polluting the food chain at the most basic level which transfers up the chain and has even reached the Arctic Ocean. John Stossel....if you can&#39;t chew gum and walk at the same time, give up reporting. Selective understanding is not helpful.

The silly graph with 600 people dying from heat vs 1200 from cold has nothing to do with climate. It has to do with stupid people. Heat victims: roofers working in 100 degree hot sun, babies left in car, runners on 20 mile run in desert. Cold victims: drunk college kids passed out in snowbank, people driving in north Dakota in a blizzard, hunters getting lost in the woods, snowmobilers falling through ice.

Coincidentally, this was the very end of the the 400 years of the &quot;Little Ice Age&quot; and the baseline for the infamous &quot;Gore-Mann Hockey-Stick Temperature Graph&quot;. Those 4+ centuries of below normal temps and expanding glaciers and sea ice caused the deaths of more than 65 million people; but you never hear a peep about that from the Warmist Scientists...EVER!. <br /><br />Added to that little perspective enhancer is the fact that the vast majority of Warmist Scientists on the government payroll - in one way or another - have tweaked, tinkered re-located and re-calibrated their newest instrumentation in such way as to reflect their dogma and not reality. If you recall, the fact that they were doing that was revealed in the &quot;Climate-Gate&quot; emails, back in 2009. Do you think they have changed their strategy and manipulations in the ensuing years? Refined and better concealed their methods perhaps. But reformed? Not a chance. Their careers, social and professional connections, income...their very identity is wrapped around the Climate Change Meme in Gordian Knots. <br /><br />The Left is wedded to the Cudgel Climate Change and the power and control it provides them over every human activity and endeavor imaginable.<br /><br />Wake up folks.

Greenland was called Greenland because there was no ice and it was lush and green with vegetation brought about by much higher CO2 levels than today. Earths glacial and inter glacial climate cycles have occurred long before man came along. If CO2 was driving climate cycles then why do all ice core records show that temperature changes always lead CO2 changes by 400-600 years? The cause and effect relationship is backwards which proves that atmospheric CO2 has nothing to do with climate change. It is however plant food. Ice cores show that CO2 concentrations have been much higher than today averaging around 2000 ppm with vast increases in plant growth and diversity of species. All before man had fire. If the sun heats the planet and the climate varies there is nothing man can do about it except to do as all species have done ADAPT. Emails leaked to the public from Anglican university proved that anthropogenic global warming is fake science with the intention of scaring an ignorant public into giving up their money to globalist billionaires.

So the question is, why did the climate change all those times before man was even here. Answer, because there are other factors to our climate besides humans and we cannot control that.

(there is more energy stored in the arctic methane than there is in coal in the world). This is called the methane dragon. If the process of the release of the methane, currently frozen in the soil and ocean beds of the Arctic, which may have already begun, but if it spins out of control we are looking an 8-degree rise in temperature. <br /> <br />But it is worse than that. <br /> <br />The report which gives us 12 years to get our head&#39;s out of our arses underestimated the amount of heat stored in the world&#39;s oceans, as we discovered in mid-January by 40%... so no, we don&#39;t have 12 more years. And the contention that this destructive anthropogenic effect on climate is either new or natural is incorrect. A recent study of tree ring size the world over has found synchronized global droughts since about the year 1900. A phenomenon which did not exist in the 1000 previous years.

Insects are disappearing at 6 times the speed of larger animals and at a rate of about 2.5% of their biomass every year. These are our pollinators. These are links in our food chain. These represent the basic functioning of every terrestrial ecosystem/ But it is worse than that. 58% of the biomass of vertebrate life on earth has been lost since 1970. That is basically in my lifetime! Additionally, a new study has shown that over 1 million species are now in danger of extinction due to human activity. Millions of years of evolution are being wiped out on a daily bases. But it is worse than that. The amount of Carbon we add to the atmosphere is equal to a yearly a human-caused forest fire 20% bigger than the continent of Africa. Yes, that is every single year!

UgzehGpgOPZDWPmABjx4AaABAg.8waODEjwmPA8waOIRPzz07		0	2019-06-25 06:45:07	Bob John	But it is worse than that The conservative, American Meteorological Society indicates that our willful blindness and greed will have effects well beyond the climate. The world's oceans will see a 150% increase in acidity and over a full degree Celsius in warming. This well down the path to the Permian extinction where 96% of marine species disappeared forever. But it is worse than that. The IPCC report ignores the effects of humans messing up the Nitrogen cycle through agricultural fertilizers and more... Don't go down this rabbit hole if you want to sleep at night. But it is worse than that. Sea level rise will not be gradual. Even assuming that the billions of tons of water that is currently being dumped down to the ground level of Greenland isn't creating a lubricant which eventually will allow the ice to free-flow into the northern oceans; it is only the friction to the islands surface that is currently holding the ice back. Then consider the same process is happening in Antarctica but is also coupled with the disappearance of the ice shelves which act as buttresses holding the glaciers from free flowing into the southern ocean. then factor in thermal expansions; the simple fact that warmer water takes up more space and It becomes clear that we are not looking at maintaining the current 3.4mm/yr increase in sea level rise (which incidentally is terrifying when you multiply it out over decades and centuries.) We will be looking at major calving events that will result in much bigger yearly increases coupled with an exponential increase in glacial melting. We know that every increase of 100ppm of C02 increases sea level by about 100 feet. We have already baked in 130 feet of sea level rise. It is just a question of how long it is going to take to get there... and then keep on rising.

During the last ice age, carbon levels were 4 times what they are today. Carbon dioxide (CO2) makes up 0.04% of the Earths atmosphere, of which 3% of atmospheric CO2 comes from humans. The Paris climate accord costs $100 billion dollars annually, yet even the most optimistic models say that it will only make the Earth warm 0.25 of a degree less over a 100 year span. The Maldives were supposed to be underwater by the year 2000 yet you can still get a 30 loan to build any kind of building or house in the Maldives in 2019. New York city was supposed to be underwater by 2015, yet construction projects continue to be built all along the coast in 2019. The polar ice caps were supposed to be gone by 1988, 1995, 2003, 2008 and 2013 yet they are still there.	UCrtH_ikG7r8YCr4omwX9mnQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrtH_ikG7r8YCr4omwX9mnQ	0

The atmosphere doesn't have a capacity for more water vapor unless the atmosphere first gets hotter (in the current state of climate is being facilitated by increased CO²). _"It’s true that water vapor is the largest contributor to the Earth’s greenhouse effect. On average, it probably accounts for about 60% of the warming effect. However, water vapor does not control the Earth’s temperature, but is instead controlled by the temperature. This is because the temperature of the surrounding atmosphere limits the maximum amount of water vapor the atmosphere can contain."_ https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/climatescience/climatesciencenarratives/its-water-vapor-not-the-co2.html	UC0HIQhAcR4Bbve1EFU-qqKg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0HIQhAcR4Bbve1EFU-qqKg	1	UgxUnGyABlNaUhby-yJ4AaABAg	David Peterson

Who do you guess would profit by a Public Scare about an impending Ice Age??? THE COAL/OIL Industries???? ============================================================== ===================== I mentioned the Milankovitch Cycles to show you how UN-NATURAL this sudden, atypical rise in temperatures has been. THIS IS NOT AN INTERGLACIAL PEAK...that occurred 7500 years ago...this is a gross interruption in EARTH'S most powerful natural Cycles. We know we are past the Holocene Optimum because science extensively studies Earth's Orbital Cycle. We are still cycling AWAY from our Source of heat...the Sun.- ---------->We should be cooling! We are still in an Axial Tilt away from our Source of heat...the Sun.-->We should be cooling! Earth's Wobble is conducive --------------------------------------------------------------->to cooling. IN FACT, The Current Solar Cycle is a decrease in Solar OUTPUT for the last 40+ years.

And in the last interglacial(Eemian) temperature peak was higher than is today. From Wikipedia: The Eemian climate is believed to have been about as stable as that of the Holocene.[citation needed] Changes in the Earth's orbital parameters from today (greater obliquity and eccentricity, and perihelion), known as Milankovitch cycles, probably led to greater seasonal temperature variations in the Northern Hemisphere.[citation needed] Although global annual mean temperatures were probably several degrees warmer than today, during summer months, temperatures in the Arctic region were about 2-4 °C higher than today.[6] The warmest peak of the Eemian was around 125,000 years ago, when forests reached as far north as North Cape, Norway (which is now tundra) well above the Arctic Circle at 71°10′21″N 25°47′40″E. Hardwood trees such as hazel and oak grew as far north as Oulu, Finland. At the peak of the Eemian, the Northern Hemisphere winters were generally warmer and wetter than now, though some areas were actually slightly cooler than today. The hippopotamus was distributed as far north as the rivers Rhine and Thames.[7] Trees grew as far north as southern Baffin Island in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago: currently, the northern limit is further south at Kuujjuaq in northern Quebec. Coastal Alaska was warm enough during the summer due to reduced sea ice in the Arctic Ocean to allow Saint Lawrence Island (now tundra) to have boreal forest, although inadequate precipitation caused a reduction in the forest cover in interior Alaska and Yukon Territory despite warmer conditions.[8] The prairie-forest boundary in the Great Plains of the United States lay further west near Lubbock, Texas, whereas the current boundary is near Dallas. The period closed as temperatures steadily fell to conditions cooler and drier than the present, with a 468-year-long aridity pulse in central Europe 116,000 BC,[9] and by 112,000 BC, a glacial period had returned. How do you know that we already past this interglacial temperature peak? It's very clear that we didn't yet reach peak of this interglacial period.

It is downright idiotic to think you know better than all the world&#39;s top climate scientists combined. Of course you&#39;ll all come up with a list of would-be &quot;scientists&quot; who might be into some climate change denial, but be sure that these are hacks and totally unqualified. Of course you&#39;ll do anything to blind yourselves for the truth because you think it doesn&#39;t fit your political agendas. The problem is that there is no more time for this immature idiocy to distract humanity from doing something urgently about CO2 emissions. It&#39;s time TO STOP TREATING THE ATMOSPHERE LIKE A GIANT WASTE BIN FOR CO2.	UCf4yljgFdznPjPK_eBbUA_Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf4yljgFdznPjPK_eBbUA_Q	0

Chemically extracted, rather than cold pressed, plant oils also worsen risks for heart disease. They have been found to be inflammatory inducing. Yes, animal products are risk factors, but are often no worse or even better for you than refined plant based food. It's the refined, adulterated and indigestible food additives that are often the worst for you ... Eliminate those preferentially, then if you still want, reduce or eliminate animal products except what may be needed if a deficiency occurs.

Renewable energy doesn't account fo 5 cents on the dollar in subsidies/supports. It has been subsidized, supported and gifted TAXPAYER FUNDS SINCE 1918, in the USA. As we entered the 21st century, 1% of the ENTIRE world's GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (Trillions of Dollars) was siphoned from the taxpayers to a few thousand families who own the Fossil Fuel INDUSTRIES...and their global deep state banks. As we approach 2020, nearly 6.5% of the ENTIRE world's GDP (many Trillions of Dollars) are not SUCKED into the few thousand families and their Deep State Globalist banks. . The nearly 2 dozen Greenhouse gasses being disposed of/dumped into our atmosphere are TOXIC. . The Goldilocks Levels for Human CREATION and EVOLUTION has been, for millions of years, between 180ppm and 300ppm. For all of those tens of millions of years, life on earth has PROSPERED...indeed, has thrived! . In the last few decades, human industry/agriculture has driven NORMAL, PRO HUMAN LIFE, CO2 GAS LEVELS well above 415ppm...an over 40% increase. "The Health Warnings about Dramatically HIGHER Atmospheric levels of CO2, continue to rise as CO2 & nearly 2DZ other gasses RISE TO ABNORMAL LEVELS at an ABNORMALLY HIGH RATE OF INCREASE, which in turn, raises the already elevated concentrations of CO2 & other atmospheric gasses in closed rooms, buildings, and basements! .. --> We are the Canaries in the Mine Shaft: . "Growing evidence suggests that environmentally relevant elevations in CO2 ... may pose direct risks for human health” […] This Solid early evidence indicates potential health risks at CO2 exposures as low as 1,000 ppm —a threshold that is already exceeded in many indoor environments with increased room occupancy and reduced building ventilation rates, and equivalent to some estimates for urban outdoor air concentrations before 2100. “Continuous exposure to increased atmospheric CO2 could be an overlooked stressor of the modern and/or future environment” . https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-019-0323-1 . Direct human health risks of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide, largely produced by heavy industry, Coal Electric Generation.! . Environmental toxins impair immune system over multiple generations Posted: 02 Oct 2019 11:42 AM PDT New Solid Research shows that Maternal exposure to a common and ubiquitous form of industrial pollution can harm the immune system of offspring and that this injury is PASSED ALONG to subsequent generations, weakening the body's defenses against infections such as the influenza virus, Colds, Flu's. . "CO2 Health Impacts in Confined Indoor Spaces A considerable amount of recent literature worldwide has documented CO2 impacts in classrooms from kindergartens to universities (Bako-Biro et al 2011; Widory and Javoy 2003; Kukadia et al. 2005; Dijken et al. 5 2005; Branco et al. 2015; Heudorf et al. 2009; Santamouris et al. 2008; Ferreira and Cardoso 2014; Gaihre et al. 2014; Jurado, et al. 2014; Lee and Chang 2000; Muscatiello et al 2015; / Carreiro-Martins et al. 2014). . Most agree levels of CO2 in 20-50% of classrooms commonly exceed 1,000 ppm and are often as high as 6,000 ppm for extended periods. Recorded impacts on health are of a minor nature but include sneezing, rales, wheezing, rhinitis, and asthma (Carreiro-Martins et al. 2014; Ferreira and Cardoso 2014). . Other symptoms; i.e. cough, headache, and irritation of mucous membranes, were also identified (Ferreira and Cardoso 2014). . Lack of concentration was associated with CO2 levels above 1,000 ppm. Gaihre et al. (2014) show some neuro-physiologic symptoms (i.e., headache, fatigue, difficulty concentrating) at CO2 levels greater than 1,000 ppm (Muscatiello et al. 2015)." . "In workplaces such as offices, high CO2 level impacts show a range of health effects similar to classrooms, depending on the number or density of workers and the types of ventilation systems (Lu et al. 2015; Tsai et al. 2012, Seppanen et al. 1999). . Such studies make a link between CO2 levels in offices and Sick Building Syndrome (SBS) with workers complaining of headaches, dizziness, fatigue, respiratory tract symptoms, eye symptoms, nasal and mucous membrane symptoms (Seppanen et al. 1999; Lu et al. 2015; Tsai et al. 2012; Vehviläinen et al. 2016). Seppanen et al. (1999)." . . . Unless you ARE a turnip, Kindly be advised that for tens of millions-upon-millions of years, all LIFE on Planet Earth has thrived on atmospheric CO2 & GH Gas levels working in a multiplier affect with water vapour at GOLDILOCKS LEVELS between 180ppm & 300ppm. .

Tossing even 1-trillion tons of C02 into an area that will hold 10-quadrillion tons and claiming it&#39;s going to have a huge negative effect is like throwing a bee-bee into the ocean and expecting it to cause a tidal wave.

UgzcqetqtDjhIF9MGkJ4AaABAg.8v9_DONvMYV93ee77Wqzyp		0	2020-01-11 18:40:14	Rick Kooi	ENVIRONMENT Here's Why Plants Aren't Just Growing Faster With All The CO2 in The Atmosphere SEBASTIAN LEUZINGER, THE CONVERSATION 19 OCT 2019 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) is warming our climate, but it also affects plants directly. A tree planted in the 1850s will have seen its diet (in terms of atmospheric carbon dioxide) double from its early days to the middle of our century. More CO2 generally leads to higher rates of photosynthesis and less water consumption in plants. So, at first sight, it seems that CO2 can only be beneficial for our plants. But things are a lot more complex than that. Higher levels of photosynthesis don't necessarily lead to more biomass production, let alone to more carbon dioxide sequestration. At night, plants release CO2 just like animals or humans, and if those respiration rates increase simultaneously, the turnover of carbon increases, but the carbon stock doesn't. You can think of this like a bank account – if you earn more but also spend more, you're not becoming any richer. Even if plants grow more and faster, some studies show there is a risk for them to have shorter lifespans. This again can have negative effects on the carbon locked away in biomass and soils. In fact, fast-growing trees (e.g. plantation forests) store a lot less carbon per surface area than old, undisturbed forests that show very little growth. Another example shows that plants in the deep shade may profit from higher levels of CO2, leading to more vigorous growth of vines, faster turnover, and, again, less carbon stored per surface area. . Water savings The effect of CO2 on the amount of water plants use may be more important than the primary effect on photosynthesis. Plants tend to close their leaf pores slightly under elevated levels of CO2, leading to water savings. In certain (dry) areas, this may indeed lead to more plant growth. But again, things are much more complex and we don't always see positive responses. Research we published in Nature, Plants this year on grasslands around the globe showed that while dry sites can profit from more CO₂, there are complex interactions with rainfall. Depending on when the rain falls, some sites show zero or even negative effects in terms of biomass production. Currently, a net amount of three gigatons of carbon are thought to be removed from the atmosphere by plants every year. This stands against over 11 gigatons of human-induced release of CO2. It is also unclear what fraction of the three gigatons plants are taking up due to rising levels of CO2. In summary, rising CO2 is certainly not bad for plants, and if we restored forested land at a global scale, we could help capture additional atmospheric carbon dioxide. But such simulations are optimistic and rely on conversion of much needed agricultural land to forests. Reductions in our emissions are unavoidable, and we have very strong evidence that plants alone will not be able to solve our CO2 problem.

"Claim: An eruption of carbon dioxide from a lake killed hundreds of people. Status: True. Origins: Carbon dioxide is a substance we generally associate with the happy little bubbles that enliven our favorite brands of soda and beer. We are not accustomed to thinking of it as dangerous, as most of our interactions with it are innocuous. Moreover, memories of high school biology remind us that while we breathe in oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide, plants operate in the opposite fashion by soaking up carbon dioxide and exuding oxygen, making for an efficient symbiotic relationship between people and plants. Carbon dioxide is a natural part of the world around us, ergo, we don’t view it with the same level of apprehension with which we regard manmade compounds. . Yet carbon dioxide is also a deadly gas. Countless miners laboring underground have forfeited their lives to “choke damp,” the term for the oxidizing of carbon trapped within coal. When this process takes place in an enclosed space (such as the depths of a mine), the resulting carbon . dioxide cannot dissipate and forms an invisible deadly cloud. Accounts given by people who witnessed choke damp in action described deaths that came so quickly the victims had no chance to escape. One person, recounting the fate of eight men and one woman who walked into an area where the gas had accumulated, said they “fell down dead, as if they had been shot.” Another narrative of a different death said the stricken miner was “without access to cry but once ‘God’s mercy.'” . Miners not only walked into deadly accumulations of choke damp; they were also sometimes lowered into them by being let down into mine shafts on ropes. If they hit pockets of carbon dioxide during their descents, they would fall from those ropes dead. While keeping caged canaries or rats in a mine would signal the presence of “white damp” (carbon monoxide) before it became lethal to humans, animal warning systems were of little use against “fire damp” (methane) and “choke damp” (carbon dioxide), the former because its danger only came to fruition if it came into contact with open flame (such as a candle or lamp), and the latter because it killed so quickly as to make such warnings useless. (Carbon monoxide is the gas utilized by those who commit suicide by piping exhaust fumes back into their cars or running automobile engines while parked in closed garages. Methane, sometimes known as “swamp gas” or “marsh gas,” is the major constituent of natural gas.) Persons not employed in the coal mining trade are unlikely to encounter deadly masses of carbon dioxide, yet such clouds have been known to form in the open air and at a cost dear in human life. Which was indeed the case on 21 August 1986 at Lake Nyos in Cameroon. Carbon dioxide naturally seeps from geothermal sources below that body of water and dissolves under pressure in the cold layer at the bottom of the lake. The water serves to hold the carbon dioxide in place, and over time the lake becomes infused with the compound. Once the saturation point is achieved (when the water can absorb no more carbon dioxide), the lake turns deadly. On the fateful night of 21 August 1986, the deep waters of the lake either reached their carbon dioxide saturation point or something happened to disturb the layer lurking at the bottom of the lake (such as a rockslide), and without warning the lake “turned over,” its bottom layer shooting to the surface in a violent, frothy eruption of carbonated water that flew some 250 feet into the sky. The lake waters turned red as dissolved iron was sucked up to the surface by the turmoil. An estimated 100 million cubic metres of gas emerged from the lake in that explosion, quickly sweeping over the valleys surrounding Lake Nyos and, being denser than air, sinking to suffocate/poison the inhabitants below. Death came quickly. One man living just two hours on foot from the lake said, “We heard a noise, just like a gunshot.” He immediately checked on his two young daughters, and found them already dead in their beds. A total of 1,746 people were smothered in the night, according to the official casualty toll. The deadly cloud covered an area of up to 12 miles around the lake, killing thousands of cattle as well. A similar incident in 1984 at Lake Monoun, another crater lake in western Cameroon, killed 37 people."

So you see, CO2 has some current benefits & some immediate challenges to human well being ! https://www.natureworldnews.com/articles/15166/20150615/climate-change-plants-choke-much-carbon.htm . 3. CO2 Kills! . CO2 is a pollutant. ALL ANIMALS ON EARTH EXHALE CO2 to dispose of this Poisonous waste product, JUST LIKE pee and poop! It kills, since it IS a poison It kills, since it IS an Asphyxiant (heavier than air, it smothers life) . (the higher the level of CO2, the lower the level of Oxygen) . EVERY LARGE Building ON EARTH is MANDATED TO HAVE A Fresh Air Recirculation System! In order to fight the VERY HARMFUL effects of CO2 settling in basements and SEALED ROOMS. . THINK! AS atmospheric CO2 levels increase, so does the THREAT of CO2 in basements, sealed rooms, in protected valleys/glades. * "Police: Carbon dioxide led to death in McDonald's bathroom. STORY HIGHLIGHTS: The carbon dioxide built up to toxic levels in the bathroom An 80-year-old woman died after the incident September 7, lethal dose of carbon dioxide, authorities said Wednesday...." * CO2 is heavier than air, so the concentration near the floor will be much higher," as well as protected glades, basements and sealed rooms.

LESS IRON LESS PROTEIN LESS ZINC LESS COPPER etc. MOREOVER, pernicious weeds are stimulated MORE than food crops. AND FINALLY, have you noticed, YOU ARE NOT A TURNIP?? Surprise!!! Humans along with all animals EXHALE CO2, which is a ---TOXIC WASTE PRODUCT--- of our digestive tract! .......just like PEE and POOP. They also make good fertilizers. Just don't eat the veggies/grains that grow in that media! . For millions of years, life has flourished on Earth with CO2(& other Greenhouse gasses) between 180ppm & 300ppm. Humans' entire existence is based on those Goldilocks levels of CO2, 180ppm to 300ppm! . It kills, since it IS a poison It kills, since it IS an Asphyxiant (heavier than air, it smothers life) .

"Higher Concentrations of CO2 in the Atmosphere increases incidents of threatening concentrations at ground levels and basements..." * * "One person, recounting the fate of eight men and one woman who walked into a basement area where the gas had accumulated, said they “fell down DEAD as if they had been shot.” * EVERY large building on EARTH has Fresh Air Recirculation Systems in order to fight off effects of CO2 build up...the higher concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere, increases the threat from CO2 build up in buildings, basements and protected glades." * "Examples: The plague of diseased livestock: Heat waves can make people ill, & they do the same to livestock such as dairy cows. During a recent heat wave in California, cattle died at such rates that they overwhelmed local capacity for disposing of the carcasses. The plagues of insects: In a warmer climate, insect pests, weeds, and agricultural diseases will have the chance to invade territory that previously was too cold for them. The plague of extreme weather: Scientists expect that as the climate changes, farmers will contend with intensifying floods and droughts. * CO2 effect on vertebrates-------Vic / November 21, 2016 Ocean acidification’s other evil twin – Blood acidification.

That is why there are villages and cities scattered all over the coastal sea waters of the world. <br /><br />Since the end of the 500 years of the &quot;Little Ice Age&quot;, around 1876 - during which time sea levels were fairly stable, the earth&#39;s glaciers advanced for miles and the freezing temperatures were responsible for the deaths of over 65 million people world wide; and the destruction of Napoleon&#39;s Grand Army - sea levels have risen about 8.5 inches. Nothing really odd about the slightly increased annual sea level rise, after nearly 500 years of &quot;Global Cooling&quot; and increased glaciation. Further, I note that there have been 3 major periods of sea level rise - each lasting centuries - since the end of the last period of Global Glaciation, 11,500 years ago. <br /><br />Ice is the destroyer of civilization. Stuff grows well in the tropics or in a green house...on a glacier...not so much. <br /><br />Climatological Myopia is a disease that attacks mostly Green-Progressives. <br /><br />Sadly, common sense in the only treatment, and so they have little hope of cure.

After opening my mind to both sides I found that the man made Global warming hypothesis is a complete hustle and a fraud. The evidence and models do not back up the preponderance of evidence against man made global warming. And scientist follow suit because they know if they speak ill of the new religion they will get no money to do research and thus be unemployed. They are whores to the government.

Greenpeace started protesting nuclear power since 1971. Meltdowns like the one in Fukushima or Chernobyl release enormous amounts of radiation . the waste generated by nuclear reactors remains radioactive for tens to hundreds of thousands of years . Nuclear power plants are a potential risk of terrorist attacks. Leonardo DiCaprio's Foundation is also against nuclear energy .

THE CLEANEST COAL Electric PLANTS still produces MILLIONS of Tons of TOXIC Coal Ash/year. . All that ash has to go somewhere, so it’s dumped in the backyards of power plants across the nation —into earth lined open-air ponds/pits / precarious surface-waste pools. . Most of these sites lack ANY adequate safeguards, leaving nearby communities at risk from potential large-scale disasters like the massive coal ash spill in Tennessee in 2008 & from gradual yet equally dangerous contamination as coal ash toxins seep into drinking water Aquifers or are blown into nearby communities. . Coal ash pollution/toxic waste contains high levels of toxic heavy metals such as arsenic, lead, selenium, lithium, other cancer-causing agents. . The public health hazards & environmental threats to nearby communities from unsafe coal ash dumping have been known for many DECADES, including increased risk of cancer, learning disabilities, neurological disorders, birth defects, reproductive failure, asthma (1 million new cases/yr.), and other illnesses. . Coal ash is NOT subject to federal supervision, and state laws governing coal combustion waste disposal are weak or nonexistent. . The result: TENS Millions of tons of TOXIC coal ash PRODUCED BY EACH COAL ELECTRIC PLANT are being stored in hundreds to thousands of ponds, landfills, and abandoned mines...in 47 states. . TVA disaster in Tennessee in which a EARTHEN dike is holding back decades’ worth of coal ash failed at the Kingston Fossil Plant, flooding the surrounding residential area with more than one billion gallons of toxic coal ash —enough to flood more than 3,000 acres one foot deep. . While dramatic events like the coal ash spill in Tennessee garner national media attention, dangerous contaminants are quietly seeping from TOXIC killer coal ash dumps into groundwater supplies across the country or blowing into the air of communities, exposing people and wildlife to toxic substances. ...data indicates that at least 535REGISTERED SITES (nearly 2000 in 47 states) OPEN TOXIC coal ash ponds, pools, pits & old mine shafts! . KNOWN to operate without a simple liner to prevent dangerous chemicals and heavy metals from reaching drinking water aquifers or leaking into streams. . The Hazards of Coal Ash FROM Electric Generation. Living near a wet coal ash storage pond is significantly more dangerous than smoking a pack of cigarettes a day, according to a risk assessment done by the EPA. The toxins found in coal ash have been linked to organ disease, cancer, respiratory illness, neurological damage, and developmental problems. . People living within one mile of unlined coal ash ponds can have a 1 in 50 risk of cancer —more than 2,000 times higher than what the EPA considers acceptable. . Coal ash contains arsenic, lead, mercury, and selenium, as well as aluminum, barium, boron, and chlorine. All are toxic. Particularly where there is prolonged exposure, these toxins can cause cancer, heart damage, lung disease, respiratory distress, kidney disease, reproductive problems, gastrointestinal illness, birth defects, impaired bone growth in children, and behavioral problems. . In short, coal ash toxins have the potential to injure all of the major organ systems in adults (including pregnant women) and children. Exposure to toxic coal ash can lower birth rates, cause tissue disease, slow development, and even kill plants and animals, leading to changes in wildlife concentrations and disruptions to entire ecosystems. . The toxic pollution from coal ash builds up in exposed animals and plants, causing the pollution to make its way up the food chain when they are eaten. . Children are more susceptible to the health impacts of coal ash —and according to the EPA, 1.54 million children live near coal ash storage sites. . Not only is coal ash toxic, it is also likely to grow increasingly dangerous. . Air pollution control technologies, like SCRUBBERS, selective catalytic reduction, and activated carbon injection, capture mercury, and other hazardous air pollutants and are able to stop increasing amounts of toxic pollution from going up the smokestacks. . However, when those pollutants are captured they are shifted from the air to the TOXIC coal ash.

Nuclear has high start up costs but it provides very cheap power with very little waste (relative to fossil fuels) which can easily handled, and the costs of a reactor can come down if we make more of them. And if anything, you are misleading many more people than I by giving blatantly false information. "nuclear waste is stored in underground pools and we [united states] have no solution to the waste (paraphrasing)" is quite a lot of false information. The high level waste (what you want to worry about) is only stored in those pools for 5-10 years to get rid of the highly radioactive particles that generates heat and radiation which make it unsafe. After that the high level waste is stored is either stored underground forever or in sealed concrete containers, often on site at a nuclear reactor.

There is so little waste generated in comparison with fossil fuel plants, that probably anyone with a basement would be able to fit both the waste and some containment container to keep it safe. PS. I found somewhere, that nuclear power plant that outputs 1000MW requires around 40 tonnes of fuel per year. So it means that it needs around 0,0045 grams of fuel for 1kWh. If you use 3000kWh yearly, then after 100 years of usage you have spent below 1,4 kg of fuel, which is like a bottle of mineral water. I am not sure how much waste is generated per 1 kg of fuel put into the reactor, but it should not be that much more - after all the spent fuel is the most problematic one. And since this waste decays and in a thousand years will be way less dangerous, you probably need enough space to just fit a dozen or so bottles and you are good for eternity (assuming your energy needs are around 3000kWh/year). I know, I know, there are many simplifications, but still if you compare it with entire trains of coal that go into coal plants (and get spewed out or captured as ashes, CO2, etc) then the amount of radioactive waste is just laughable.

Put aside all the politics in the academia, just look at what sea level rise has done to Kiribati, Tuvalu, and several other Pacific Island Nations, as well as the Tangier Islands on coastal Virginia. Most continental countries just didn&#39;t hit the threshold yet, but once they did just expect the coastal areas to be hit first--many of the major cities in the world like New York, LA, are established on the coastal lowland.

Yet it doesn't mean that try to slow down the pace of our post-industrialization emission increase even by a tiny bit which almost all environmental policies nowadays aim for is a bad first step—It's better than doing nothing or even backtracking anyways. Meanwhile, hopeless it might sound to contain human impact at full extent, human effort is not totally futile on a smaller scale. Looking at China's effort in reforestation and fight desertification over the last 40 years you will definitely realize that.

Major forces of change include; Tidal cycles, storms, water and sediment runoff, large ocean currents such as the Gulf Stream. Tidal forces are magnified by storms, low pressure, high pressure systems, tropical storms, and Hurricanes. Also El Nino Southern Oscillation and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation add even more changes in weather, Currents and pressure. Barrier Islands grow in size, decrease in size, appear and disappear because of these forces. We build sea walls, jetties and haul in vast quantities of sand to restore the beaches that nature takes away. Looking at aerial pictures from different decades we see how barrier islands and coastal littoral zones are changing. But humans keep trying to fight mother nature and keep things the same. We see these same forces other coastal landforms. Lesson. It is difficult to distinguish between natural cyclic change and possible localized sea level changes. It is very complex and this makes these changes very difficult if not foolhardy to attribute it to one variable.

If done consistently it might keep the earth from warming, but they are not consistent in their spraying. The other thing these morons believe is our earth has more CO2 than it should, but then conveniently forget that all the plant life on this planet use CO2 to facilitate photosynthesis, and then excrete Oxygen which we breath.

The United States comprise about 2 % of the world population, and pollution is directly related to population growth and urbanization. Additionally, the pollution laws are very strict in the USA compared to other parts of the world. For example, of the 50 world cities with the highest air pollution India had 25 cities, China 20 cities, and the Middle East 5 cities, the USA 0. The Green New Deal would have a very miniscule impact on the World Pollution most likely much less than 1 %. The CO2 spike that the Greenie Weenies are hanging their hats on was likely the result of economic growth in Developing Nations and not the USA.

To be ordained as a minister you need to publish something proving climate change. As an ordained minister you are allowed to pontificate and collect tithes. If you want to piss off a minister of climatology, or one of the myopic minions, try any of the following... 1) say "CO2 is plant food." 2) say "Polar bears are thriving." 3) say "water vapor is a vastly more important green house gas, and it's wider infrared absorption bands already cover CO2's narrow bands.(*) 4) The earth is 15% greener now than when satellites first started taking pictures. (**) 5) What ever science there once was has been hijacked by socialists. 6) Grand Solar Minimum. 7) We've had ice ages with 4,500 ppm CO2, and warm periods with 200 ppm CO2; clearly CO2 is not the control knob on the earth's temperature. 8) Termites emit way more methane than cows. 9) Why have the ice caps on Mars melted? 10) Al Gore bought seaside property; he ain't worried. (*) Al Gore said in his movie, "If you ignore the effect of water vapor, CO2 is the most powerful greenhouse gas." This is like saying, "If you ignore that man with the machine gun, the guy with the pocket knife is the most dangerous man in the room." (**) and follow this up with the reason: plants lose water to gain CO2. The 100 ppm increase has made it so that instead of losing 100 water molecules for every CO2 the plant captures, it now only loses 84. The greening has turned up around the margins of deserts, and has nothing to do with humans planting anything.

We all should have a questioning attitude about everything and not take what someone says as gospel. There is no definitive proof that the warming of the planet is directly linked to human activities alone, and no way to prove natural warming vs human interaction. That being said we should always be looking to make more efficient products and use more efficient processes and not be so wasteful of resources but let the private sector do that. The government wastes more resources than anyone so why the hell would we allow them to dictate to us how resources should be spent? I do believe in climate change, it changes every damn day. It rains, it&#39;s sunny, it&#39;s hot, it&#39;s cold. I don&#39;t believe in this nonsense that we are dying in 12 years.

Over 200 sites AROUND THE WORLD, run by different governments and institutions of higher learning have been studying CO2 and Other Atmospheric Gas Levels for decades. CO2 (along with its multiplier H2O) and every other greenhouse gas (nearly 2 dozen) have been rising nearly each and every year. IT has been millions of years since CO2 has been at these high levels. These Gasses are called TRACE GASSES because they are small percentages of the atmosphere....NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE INEFFECTIVE. 1. CO2 is 412ppm is warming this planet at record rates ! 2. hydrogen cyanide kills humans at 130ppm ! 3. polonium kills at 1 TRILLIONTH that amount !

If the waiter (Co2 emmissions) keeps on bringing you food, and more food, to your table. First you can eat it al, because it comes every 15 minutes. But after a while the waiter brings it every 2 minutes. You can never keep up with the growning amount of food on your table, it keeps stacking up because you can't eat that fast and a lot in one sitting. That's the same with the plants and trees, if the CO2 amount keeps rising, and becoming larger and larger, fast and faster. Eventually it overruns the acceptable amount. Plus it's not the plan of the scientists to eliminate CO2 all together, it's to slow down the CO2 the increasing production. We still need CO2, but not the increasing amount right now and in the future. 😊	UCjJURCEuuw1keulDxwrGxXQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjJURCEuuw1keulDxwrGxXQ	1	Ugw8AfA6qcGicjpmviR4AaABAg	James Frazier

UgxKt9L70kKkCR3Z9vJ4AaABAg	2	2	2019-03-29 07:35:48	Eric Singley	Here&#39;s an idea. Nuclear power. If you want to talk fear mongering and the environment, we have to bring up nuclear power generation. Fossil lobbyists hate nuclear because it undercuts them environmentally, and renewable lobbyists hate it because it doesn&#39;t bring money to their witch hunt. But safe, clean, reliable nuclear power generation has existed for decades, and more investment will only lower the costs. Nuclear has a high energy density, and can make power 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It&#39;s one of the safest power generating sources... with a much lower death rate than coal, and gas. And it doesn&#39;t take up all the land space that renewables do and destroy natural ecosystems. You need 14 square miles of solar panels, or 300 square miles of wind farm just to make up for 1 single 1,000MW nuclear plant. Nuclear also has low by-products... it doesn&#39;t create fly-ash or flare gas off into the air. It doesn&#39;t end up with heaps of outdated, stranded capital (old solar panels and wind turbines) that will find their way to the land fill. Why are we so concerned with harnessing the power of sunlight when we can create our own sun? We can use current fission technology, and focus our subsidies on figuring out fusion for our future kids. Ya&#39;ll even realize that we use taxpayer money to the tune of $20 billion a year to subsidize fossil fuels? What a complete joke!

This is the story of a little is terrific and a lot is deadly...take Aspirin, for example. The Goldi Locks Level for humans of atmospheric CO2 has always been between 180ppm & 290ppm! For every Year a human has walked on Earth (hundreds of thousands of them) CO2 & other Gasses have ALWAYS been between 180ppm and 290ppm. Our Entire Physiology is BUILT UPON THOSE NUMBERS 180ppm and 290ppm. Today, we have increased those gas levels to 412ppm. We have NO idea what the long term effects will be on our grand children. 2. CO2 has boosted plant life on Earth BUT . Coincidentially, as CO2 levels have increased, Nutrient values have FALLEN at a Faster Rate ! . LESS iron LESS protein LESS Zinc Less Copper etc. etc. . IN all of the Staple Grains that the world has become dependent upon ! So you see, CO2 has some current benefits & some immediate challenges to human well being ! . https://www.natureworldnews.com/articles/15166/20150615/climate-change-plants-choke-much-carbon.htm . 3.

UgynN1ZVlrBd8b6X_KB4AaABAg	0	0	2019-03-25 12:20:46	James Watson	While I’m extremely skeptical that CO2 (a gas that makes up less than ½ of 1 percent) of the atmosphere) is causing global warming, I will side with the Lib/Dems on this issue. If in fact, we are facing extinction due to man-made global warming, we need a dramatic and effective response. Right? <br /><br />Here’s the problem. Solar and wind do not have sufficient energy density. It’s not even remotely close.  To date renewables, which includes wind and solar along with biomass, hydro-electric, etc provides 11% of our total energy. Of this 11%, wind provides 21%.  The math: 21% of 11% equals 2.3%. So wind provides 2.3% of our total energy. Solar provides 6% of the 11% which is .66%. Just over ½ of 1 percent of our total energy. We have subsidized wind and solar over the last 20 or more year to the equivalent of 3 moon shots. Think about that one.<br /><br />When you read about how solar can provide our energy needs, be very careful in the fine print. What you will almost always find is they are saying that it will provide enough to power our houses!!! I see this over, and over, and over and over again. Households only consume about 6% of our total consumption. What about the other 94%?<br /><br />Elon Musk spoke about a postage stamp solar farm in the Texas panhandle, how it would provide all our energy. I looked it up. I did the math. He’s right, it will provide all of the energy for our homes. An area 100 miles by 100 miles. Sounds great. Except that will only get us 6% of where we need to go. So multiply that by 20 and you get the area of half the USA in solar panels in order to supply our entire energy needs. This is not a solution.<br /><br />Solar and wind are not a viable option. It has to do with energy density. <br /><br />Solar and wind are the saving grace to the big oil interest. As long as we chase the red herring, the worldwide demand will continue to grow and consume fossil fuels. I’m sure they fund research and articles pontificating on the virtues of solar and wind while laughing all the way to the bank. There is only one energy source they fear. And, I’m sure they provide funding and articles that screaming about the dangers of this energy source. That source is nuclear.<br /><br />Yes, we need to discuss the N-word, Nuclear. I’m against traditional nuclear water-pressurized reactors. They are inherently unsafe. However there is a different type of reactor that can’t melt down, creates extremely small amounts of waste, the waste generated is only radioactive for around 12 years, with a fraction radioactive for 300 years. They can be massed produced. They can be used to burn up or existing stockpiles of nuclear waste and create trillions of dollars of electricity. Unless you support Nuclear you are part of the problem.<br /><br /><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK367T7h6ZY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK367T7h6ZY</a>	UCOWuDuBgYnsgJS3bE4p7Tfw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOWuDuBgYnsgJS3bE4p7Tfw	0

ERad = SB * Temp^4. Or Temp = (ERad/SB)^0.25 Where: SB, the Stefan-Boltzmann constant is 5.670 x 10-8 Watt/meter^2 Kelvin^2 ERad, the amount of energy radiated to outer space in watts/meter^2. . For Earth at equilibrium, the amount of energy radiated should equal the amount of energy received from the sun. However, the Earth is not at equilibrium and is actually receiving slightly more energy that it is emitting. . This is why the earth is warming. If the earth were in equilibrium, then the amount of energy being radiated would equal the amount received from the sun. That is ERad would be a constant and a function of average Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) and albedo (a). ERad = TSI*(1- a)/4 TSI is 1365.5 Watts/meter^2 a, albedo which is 0.3 for Earth So, ERad is approximately 237 Watts/meter^2. . Putting this altogether yields an Earth Temperature of 254°K (-18°C or -1°F). This temperature corresponds to the atmospheres temperature at about 5 kilometers above the surface (16,000ft). It is at this elevation where the earth radiates to outer space approximately the same amount of energy it receives from the sun. . Temperatures at lower elevations are generally much warmer due to the greenhouse effect, which makes it difficult for the atmosphere to radiate infrared energy at lower elevations. In fact, greenhouse gases inhibit radiation to such an extent, that convection of heat is the dominate mechanism for transporting energy from the surface to elevations where it can be effectively radiated to outer space. . Keep in mind that the earth radiates primarly in the infrared which is the predominate wavelength at 254°K. Infrared is invisible to humans. . Anyhow, if there were no greenhouse gases, then earths surface temperature would become so cold that the oceans would freeze. . This in turn would raise the earths albedo and reflect more energy directly to outer space. In turn the Stefan-Boltzmann law would drive the temperature even colder and we would end up living on a giant snowball. . However, the earths atmosphere does have greenhouse gases. In particular CO2, which warms the atmosphere enough so that water can exist as a vapor. Since water vapor is also a greenhouse gas, together these greenhouse gases have warmed earths surface to about 287°K (14°C or 57°F). . While CO2 may comprise just a small fraction of the atmosphere, it behaves like a dye in that it absorbs infrared energy very well. Finally, the earths temperature is not in equilibrium. . The earth is absorbing about 1.5 watt/meter^2 more energy than it is emitting. . This in turn is warming the atmosphere, oceans, land, snow and ice. . By far, most of the extra heat is going into the oceans. The oceans have a tremendous capacity for storing heat and it will take a long time before they reach equilibrium. . When equilibrium is eventually reached, there will be more evaporation of water and the atmosphere will become thicker from increased amount of water vapor. . This will result in warmer surface temperatures and a higher elevation at which the earth can radiate to outer space. . I’m not the first person to figure this all out. In fact, an intergovernmental panel of climate change scientist (IPCC) have been studying this subject intently for well over 20 years. The IPCC has carefully reviewed many scientific studies and have published their latest assessment here: http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/asse... What has been concluded (TS.4.5 on page 64) is that the earths temperature is sensitive to changes of CO2 concentration.

Would you be kind enough to reply a list here? Still I dont see the point your trying to make. CO2 is a tiny particle, in fact its three particles and is considered a compound. Its theorized that it acts like an aerosol in reflecting back photons but I dont think that is true at all. There is no evidence that it does. ​ The double covalent bond that binds the C's to the O can be easily broken with UV rays. Which tells me it doesnt reflect photons back to space at all. Even if it did and combined with all the aerosols, including clouds, that would result in Global cooling, not warming at all. The fact still remains %78 nitrogen %21 oxygen %.97 Argon %.03 CO2 has never changed. Its more dense down here in the troposphere but is more inflated in the higher altitudes. The content percentages remains the same. If CO2 is ever going to be a climate disaster it will have asphyxiated us all long before as it is heavier than air. Its only natural that it fall to the surface where the plants eat the carbon atoms and release the oxygen. Im not sure if its arrogance and superiority or that your just a disgusting person but I am not a homosexual. I do not enjoy even the thought of anything being put into my rectum at all. Especially one of your old used butt devices. Just because you enjoy such activities doent mean everyone else does and may I suggest you keep your fetishes to yourself. People wont respect you behind your back. (pardon the pun). Besides If you think you are superior to me you are probably right, most people are. You dont have to get crude though.

"Ta Da" global warming! Yes I do realize how silly that is. Yet if anything is going to trap warmth in our troposphere I'm going with the aerosol that actually does trap warmth. Clouds. If the goal is to ban aerosols that do trap warmth I say ban the one that actually does trap warmth, that would be clouds. CO2 does not trap warmth. Anyone who says it does can send me some evidence, perhaps a Feynman diagram or a well worded high school term paper.

An increase in temperature does kill some species but also allows for more life to exist. The science doesn't suggest that all the climate change is man made. The solar activity shows a stronger connection to the changes we are experiencing. Sure man has an impact but it is small. The change we are experiencing is for the most part natural. Also if you look into the long term climate models they are based on ice cores which show that first temperature increases then carbon in the air increases. So don't worry the world won't end in 12 years.	UCY9x22s9pNzf23PrlTnjWNA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY9x22s9pNzf23PrlTnjWNA	1	Ugxn0UAeVptc-IL0l194AaABAg	SociallyTriggered

Maybe we wouldn't be as adapted for it but we could survive. I'm not purposing that we bring back the dinosaurs or even their environment. I was making the argument that a small rise in the world's temperature isn't a reason to fear the end of the world. There is too much hype about "climate change". I would rather efforts be made to clean the air and water which are more important for our survival and the survival of the many animals that share our planet. The difference in this is the Paris Climate Accord plans to prevent .5 degree of temperature rise over the next 100 years and spend over 20 trillion dollars to do so. This is a complete waste and helps no one. The same money could solve world poverty, clean all of the water ways, and a myriad of problems.

They are using a “consensus” to attribute human effect because they have *no factual data to support their claims.* If they did, they wouldn’t need a consensus. They would simply show their data and other scientists could replicate their tests. BUT THERE AREN’T ANY. So every few years, a group publishes their doomsday predictions and a few years later they publish updated predictions. But they have yet to be right!

Not as elaborate or as well organized as NASA and NOAA etc. but that has led to world wide broad agreement (consensus) on the human causes of Global Warming and the threats from Climate change.

Ignoring the ices melting is pretty much ignoring a big problem. There's a ton of species living there that could go extinct plus there's been accidents of polar bears attacking humans because they came from all the way there to where we live. Whatever you want to call it, the heat is the problem and it is proven to exist and it has proven to be caused by us. Denying the facts without other actual facts disproving that there isn't an ice melt to which would be pretty hard since the satellites pictures are accessible to anyone, and it clearly shows the change, then it's simply a denial act of conspiracy, just like the flat hearth, which there's nothing wrong with that, just don't make it as there's evidence disproving Global Warming when it has proven to be there and to be a problem, I could explain why it could be a massive problem for the ices to melt if you want, but I'm sure you already know the story.

CO2 has beneficially enabled life on Earth. (holding infra-red heat/warming the planet so life may proliferate)(has some fertilizer effect) (without CO2 + other Green House gases, Earth would be a Cold ROCK 0 degrees F.) . This is the story of a little is terrific and a lot is deadly...take Aspirin, for example. The Goldi Locks Level for humans of atmospheric CO2 has always been between 180ppm & 290ppm! For every Year a human has walked on Earth (hundreds of thousands of them) CO2 & other Gasses have ALWAYS been between 180ppm and 290ppm. Our Entire Physiology is BUILT UPON THOSE NUMBERS 180ppm and 290ppm. Today, we have increased those gas levels to 412ppm. We have NO idea what the long term effects will be on our grand children. 2. CO2 has boosted plant life on Earth BUT . Coincidentially, as CO2 levels have increased, Nutrient values have FALLEN at a Faster Rate ! . LESS iron LESS protein LESS Zinc Less Copper etc. etc. . IN all of the Staple Grains that the world has become dependent upon ! So you see, CO2 has some current benefits & some immediate challenges to human well being ! . https://www.natureworldnews.com/articles/15166/20150615/climate-change-plants-choke-much-carbon.htm . 3. CO2 Kills! . CO2 is a pollutant which kills, since it IS a poison kills, since it IS an Asphyxiant (heavier than air, it smothers life) . (the higher the level of CO2, the lower the level of Oxygen) . EVERY LARGE Building requires Fresh Air Recirculation Sytems to fight the VERY HARMFUL effects of CO2 settling in basements and SEALED ROOMS. AS CO2 atmospheric levels increase so does the THREAT of CO2 in basements, sealed rooms and protected valleys and glades. * "Police: Carbon dioxide led to death in McDonald's bathroom September 14, 2011 1:38 p.m. EDT STORY HIGHLIGHTS: The carbon dioxide built up to toxic levels in the bathroom An 80-year-old woman died after the incident September 7, lethal dose of carbon dioxide, authorities said Wednesday...." * CO2 is heavier than air, so the concentration near the floor will be much higher," as well as protected glades, basements and sealed rooms. . "Higher Concentrations of CO2 in the Atmosphere increases incidents of threatening concentrations at ground levels and basements..." * * "One person, recounting the fate of eight men and one woman who walked into a basement area where the gas had accumulated, said they “fell down DEAD as if they had been shot.” * * EVERY large building on EARTH has Fresh Air Recirculation Systems in order to fight off effects of CO2 build up. ..the higher concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere, increases the threat from CO2 build up in buildings, basements and protected glades." * "Examples: The plague of diseased livestock: Heat waves can make people ill, & they do the same to livestock such as dairy cows. During a recent heat wave in California, cattle died at such rates that they overwhelmed local capacity for disposing of the carcasses. . The plagues of insects: In a warmer climate, insect pests, weeds, and agricultural diseases will have the chance to invade territory that previously was too cold for them. . The plague of extreme weather: Scientists expect that as the climate changes, farmers will contend with intensifying floods and droughts. * CO2 effect on vertebrates-------Vic / November 21, 2016 Ocean acidification’s other evil twin – Blood acidification.

There is really a COMMON OVERWHELMING AGREEMENT or consensus on global warming in the Scientific Community, actively Working on / Studying this phenominon / or who had been working in these fields from EVERY NATION ON EARTH ? ----------------------------- ( ( ( I attend an evangelical church in Milwaukee, and 8 scientists in non-climatology fields, have NEVER spoken to any Scientist in ANY field that denys largely Human causation of Global Warming & the threatening climate changes it is causing. ) ) ) ------------------------------ Michael Barnard, Low-carbon Innovation Strategist Updated Apr 26, 2017 . "Depending on the method, the many studies on this subject show that from 97.1% to 99.99% of climate scientists -- defined as researchers publishing in peer-reviewed journals -- accept that the climate is rapidly changing due to human actions. . The degree of severity they ascribe to impacts of climate change varies according to their specific areas of study and their models, but those ranges are captured in the IPCC 5 scenarios, all of which show not only warming but significant negative impacts. . The high end and very recent study shows 99.99% widespread agreement/consensus. . James L. Powell, director of the National Physical Sciences Consortium, did the most recent of Many peer-reviewed, published studies showing the overwhelming consensus by climate scientists on anthropogenic climate change. . Here's what he says: If the consensus were 97%, then to find 3 peer-reviewed articles that reject AGW, one would need to read, on average, 100 articles. Instead, to find even a single rejecting article, one must read nearly 5,000 articles. The true consensus on AGW cannot be as low as 97%. [...] The only sound and practical way to judge the extent of a scientific consensus is to search for articles that reject the prevailing theory. For 2013 and 2014, I found that only 5 of 24,210 articles and JUST 4 of 69,406 researcher/authors rejected anthropogenic global warming. . His full paper is linked from that site. Also very recently, Benestad et al published a paper in the journal Theoretical Applied Climatology in July 2015. They spread an even wider net than Powell, looking at every significant paper ever published in a peer-reviewed journal that denied anthropogenic climate change. . * They found 38 papers. * . A common denominator seems to be missing contextual information or ignoring information that does not fit the conclusions, be it other relevant work or related geophysical data. In many cases, short-comings are due to insufficient model evaluation, leading to results that are not universally valid but rather are an artifact of a particular experimental setup. Other typical weaknesses include false dichotomies, inappropriate statistical methods, or basing conclusions on misconceived or incomplete physics. [...] We also note that several of these papers involved the same authors and that the different cases were not independent even if they involved different shortcomings. Some of the cases also implied interpretations that were incompatible with some of the other cases, such as pronounced externally induced geophysical cycles and a dominant role of long-term persistence (LTP); slow stochastic fluctuations associated with LTP make the detection of meaningful cycles from solar forcing difficult if they shape the dominant character in the geophysical record. . Page on springer.com It other words, the papers don't agree with one another, they are written in fairly obvious ignorance of reasonably well known science and modelling basics and there are a handful of authors who keep writing stuff that's in denial, not a large number of them. The authors of this paper -- disclosure: I've communicated with Lewandowsky, one of the authors, many times -- bend over backward to avoid saying the obvious about the authors, instead treating them with respect and suggesting reasons why they might, possibly, maybe have just been accidentally ignorant. . But what about that 97%? . Multiple studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals show that 97 percent or more of actively publishing climate scientists agree: Climate-warming trends over the past century are very likely due to human activities. . In addition, nearly ALL of the leading scientific organizations worldwide have issued public statements endorsing this position. . Scientific Overwhelming Agreement / consensus: Earth's climate is warming . Here are the five major papers that arrived at 97%: J. Cook, et al, "Quantifying the consensus on anthropogenic global warming in the scientific literature," Environmental Research Letters Vol. 8 No. 2, (June 2013); DOI:10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024024 Quotation from page 3: "Among abstracts that expressed a position on AGW [Anthropogenic, or human-cause, Global Warming], 97.1% endorsed the scientific consensus. Among scientists who expressed a position on AGW in their abstract, 98.4% endorsed the consensus.” W. R. L. Anderegg, “Expert Credibility in Climate Change,” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Vol. 107 No. 27, 12107-12109 (21 June 2010); DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1003187107. P. T. Doran & M. K. Zimmerman, "Examining the Scientific Consensus on Climate Change," Eos Transactions American Geophysical Union Vol. 90 Issue 3 (2009), 22; DOI: 10.1029/2009EO030002. N. Oreskes, “Beyond the Ivory Tower: The Scientific Consensus on Climate Change,” Science Vol. 306 no. 5702, p. 1686 (3 December 2004); DOI: 10.1126/science.1103618. . So we have seven peer-reviewed and published papers which use different techniques, published from 2004 to 2015, which show that the consensus among climate science papers is in excess of 97% and that there are a tiny number of dissenters who are making obviously incorrect statements. 1. You can argue with one paper which has not been reproduced. 2. It's harder to argue with a paper whose results have been reproduced. 3. And it's much harder to argue with multiple different methodologies which arrive at the same result. 4. In the case of climate scientists having a very STRONG COMMON AGREEMENT or a consensus on the basics of anthropogenic climate change, consilience is extremely high.

Realistically in the next hundred years it should be at 1 feet six inches. What that means is tide surges will compromise costal lands, humans will have to move more inland to survive. Eventually it will be very difficult to live on this planet, however that will be a very long time... I&#39;m hoping that well before that time humans would have developed a more suitable way of living then our current way of living...

The CAUSES of Glaciations (Malinkovitch Cycles) CONTINUE to this very day, & are Extensively Studied & Well Understood. . (There is really no debate on this subject) . (Earth's Elliptical Orbit IS pulling us away from the Sun... less heat) (Earth's Axial Tilt away from the sun!.......less heat) (Earth's Wobble is conducive to glaciation) (THOSE Cyclical Events are the TRIGGERS of Earth's MOST POWERFUL NATURAL CYCLES of CHANGE...GLACIATIONS) . (THOSE CYCLES contine to this year...yet we are Warming NOT Cooling) . Hell, MUCH of the last 1000 years is Called the Little Ice Age, compounded by the Maunder Minimum in 1450-1540. . "ICE AGE" because of the FALLING temperatures for 8000 years. "LITTLE" because it ended. It ENDED ABRUPTLY in the late 1700's. Look for yourself: http://www.realclimate.org/images//Marcott.png . WHAT INTERUPTED EARTH'S most powerful natural cycle? Since then, temperatures have been rising for OVER 2 CENTURIES! (Thomas Jefferson and John Adams discussed this notable change.) Equally important is the FACT that Our Sun's " Energy Output " has DECREASED a bit over the last 50 years...all the while these temperatures have been rising. . Look for yourself: . Solar Energy Decreases, YET Global Warming Increases, more rapidly. https://static.skepticalscience.com/pics/TvsTSI.png .. THE EARTH SHOULD BE ' COOLING ' and ' COOLING ' DRAMATICALLY ! SO, What Terminated Earth's MOST powerful NATURAL CLIMATE CHANGE Cycle ? What Terminated the Little Ice Age ? . Only the Enhanced Green House Effect fully Explains this ongoing event! Look: https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-whats-warming-the-world/ . These are not ideas which have been invented by Al Gore or Modern Science. . 1799 Alexander von Humboldt studied, worried and postulated that Human Activites / pollution would CAUSE CLIMATE CHANGE! Strip Mining entire mountain tops, Clear Cutting entire Forests, burning Coal/Peat/Wood/Oil, building huge cities which have their own climates . The First USE of " CLIMATE CHANGE " STILL in use today. . 1799 Thomas Jefferson also penned a paper on observed climate changes which he stated was probably caused by man. . "1804 : Thomas Jefferson On Climate Change | Real Science . “A change in our climate is taking place very surely. Both heat and cold are becoming moderate within the memory of even the middle-aged, and snows are less frequent and less deep.” – Thomas Jefferson 1804" 1811 Science Tied Warming, Climate Changes directly to Human Activities & Industrialization. . 1856 "....a paper entitled “Circumstances affecting the heat of the sun’s rays,” by Eunice Foote. In two brisk pages, Foote’s paper anticipated the revolution in climate science by experimentally demonstrating the effects of the sunlight on certain gases and theorizing how those gases would interact with Earth’s atmosphere for the first time. In a column of the September 1856 issue of Scientific American titled “Scientific Ladies,” Foote is praised for supporting her opinions with “practical experiments.” The writers noted: “this we are happy to say has been done by a lady.” . Foote’s research & paper demonstrated the interactions of the sun’s rays on different gases through a SERIES of experiments...." ((Variations of those fundamental Experiments are critiqued/taught in nearly every 1st year science course on colleges and Universities around the world. . 1824 Jean-Baptiste Fourier calculates that the Earth would be far colder if it lacked an atmosphere. . Svante Arrhenius (1859-1927) was a Swedish scientist that was the first to claim in 1896 that fossil fuel combustion may eventually result in enhanced global warming.

Put an ice cube in a glass of water. fill the glass up to the rim. let the ice cube melt. the level of water will remain the same. (*) North Pole = floating ice = no sea level increase. Also, the north pole has been "ice free" before. Definition of ice free is that you can sail across the polar sea in the late summer. There may still be ice (it's hard not to have ice when the winter air temperature is 50 degrees below zero), but enough ice melts to allow shipping to happen in the summer. Sorry for laughing at you. I didn't mean to laugh at you, but laugh I did. You repeated a standard inaccuracy that has been used for decades. It does not mater whether you believe me or not (there are plenty of videos that show ice melting does not change the height of water in a glass). Some other numb-skull will believe the lie and append it to comments in another video. Someone else will present that person with the science. It's whack-a-rat for ignorance. Again, sorry for laughing at you. Direct you vitriol at the person who lied to you, not the person who pointed out scientific fact. (*) And yet, there is some interesting physics going on. It's subtle, but it's truly there. Water at 0 degrees C is less dense than water at 4 degrees C. Water before it freezes floats on slightly warmer water. This is amazing! The physics say that ice crystals semi-form before ice forms, though this isn't the correct terminology. For water that is nearly freezing this is an extremely important effect. For the good of our earth, for the warmth of our earth, nearly freezing water floats above slightly warmer water. Water is one of the few liquids that do this. But it's subtle. A volume of ice weighs 90% of an equivalent volume of water. The 4 degree C effect is less than one percent. This subtle effect has been amplified by desperate people. "Half of the sea level rise is due to the thermal expansion of water." Okay, but since seas are going up by 4 inches a century, this means half of that, or two inches, is due to the expansion of water due to temperatures above four degrees C. If the seas are going up (which they have been doing steadily for 170 years) it is half due to ice melting off the land, half due to water expanding, and nothing to do with our north pole's ice melting and freezing.

The Chinese department of geoengineering has open sourced the science. 2004 Beijing Olympic headlines (in China) declared that the government would make sure it didn&#39;t rain for the Olympics. Meanwhile US government and NASA claim there&#39;s no way to alter or control the weather. This is of course because they have already weaponized weather. If you could send a drought or a hurricane or a storm you could possibly get a foreign policy change that you couldn&#39;t without a war. I&#39;ve personally researched the science and it&#39;s not so hard to understand. Weather is hot fronts and cold fronts. You can cloud seed with metal cloud aerosols, and then microwave them with arrays like HAARP. The radio waves will react with the metal, heating them up just like in a microwave. That&#39;s a man-made hot front. I personally witnessed 5 years of unmarked Boeing&#39;s spraying the leading edge of the storm fronts i tracked as a surfer. The hot fronts caused the storms to speed past the Sierra nevadas, and dump on the Midwest. This is why California had a drought and the Midwest was flooded with Pacific water. Normally the storms dump over the California Central valley and Sierra nevadas and the watersheds filling the California reservoirs. <br />Geoengineering is real. <br />Also in grade school I learned that there has been numerous ice ages and climate change is an unstoppable event. But then again mystery teachings promise man will conquer nature through intellect and technology. <br />I&#39;m sickened of the thought of government taxing for climate change, especially when u.s. military movement is the one of the largest consumers of fossil fuels. Our military doesn&#39;t need an empire cross the world, but should be recalled to within a hundred miles of our own borders. I remember back under Obama when the left and right United under <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23NoWarWithSyria">#NoWarWithSyria</a> and they had to delay and distracted with Trump and antifa.

Global warming doesnt just mean hotter temperatures all the time, its a hotter average temperature around the earth, and that can cause much higher temperature differentials, so while throughout most of the year things are blisteringly hot, come winter time the winter will also have much more extreme extremes, it may last a shorter period, but when that cold really hits, it will be deadful, we are already seeing the effects of global warming in much harsher weather conditions, not just the heat waves but the cold cold winters just get worse, blizards are getting worse, more snow fall, and even lower temperatures, on the warmer side of things we are seeing worse and worse hurricanes and other storms, and while i doubt the sea levels will rise as much as the fear mongering says, it is rising, and beach side towns will likely be completely flooded, and in the meantime it means that due to the water being higher, flash floods from these worse storms will be even worse, im not saying it will destroy the world, but shit will get more and more difficult to deal with	UCpdnhMSxLKn6XBTaDpAcH-A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpdnhMSxLKn6XBTaDpAcH-A	0

Let's put climate change to the side. Things like air pollution, while having the biggest impact locally, can spread pretty far. For example, the native people in Lapland are exposed to mercury and organic compounds that spread by air. It's hard to get away from some things. As for population, projections are for Europe to decline very slightly, all other continents are still increasing, Africa by about 200% from 2000 to 2050. India will exceed China in population by 2030, 1.53 vs 1.44 billion. The elephant in the room is the potential for wars over resources.

For example, Some European countries are declining, but overall Europe is still growing, but slowly at less than 1%. In developing countries, the population is increasing rapidly. Here you run several risks. Resource availability, or lack, especially food and clean water. The other is that as they grow and start to develop, they need more energy. This often comes from coal, which is cheap and abundant. Other forms, such as the massive Inga 3 dam in the Congo, tend to forgo any real environmental or societal impacts (think the 3 Gorges dam). I would still argue that we need to stabilize world population at current levels, and then slowly work to reduce it.

They may be ok for the short term, but multi-decade or century is unlikely given the inherent error. Also, anything has to be shown to be statistically significant. Natural year-to-year variability makes this difficult over shorter time periods, a few decades. We, in the US, don't have a bad population problem, but when you think about sub-Saharan Africa doubling in population in the next 30 years or so, that's a huge problem. Several studies have estimated the long-term sustainable carrying capacity of the Earth for humans is probably around 2 billion. Granted, the studies are very speculative.

When you look at the last aprrox 140,000 years there is an apparent correlation between CO2 and temp, sometimes CO2 leads the change, sometimes temp. This suggests that the system is more complicated. When you go back further in time, eg. the Cenozoic, the relationship breaks down. It is thought that the large cooling that we've seen during the Cenozoic (we're cooler now than the long term average) has largely been driven by plate tectonics. Humans obviously contribute in several ways. The question is it enough to create a tipping point. I would argue that we still don't know enough about the system in general to draw a conclusion.

First, the change is gradual, noticeable over a lifetime. Only a portion is due to human activity. Extremist want you to believe that we are in a dire situation, and that it will soon be irreversible, which is not true. Some examples. There is no evidence that hurricanes are getting worse or more frequent. They appear to have increased in the 1970s, which is when we started having weather satellites. When you subtract the ones that we would not have known about, because they never approached land, there is no change. On sea level rise, a new study suggests that it will help remove large amounts of carbon from the atmosphere and store it in coastal wetlands. Also, increased CO2 is causing plants to store more carbon in their tissue. Bottom line is that we are still learning how the climate system works, and we shouldn't jump to conclusions, or try to"fix" it. We should look to improve alternative energy, and, most importantly, reduce world population.

Also solar pannels produce less energy than it took to make them, coal electricity is usually the energy used to make them, they also give off horrible biproducts durring production and when they are broken down, like really bad for the environment in terms of what it does and how much is let off, the lithium ion batteries usually used to store the energy also let off horrible chemicals durring production qnd the strip mines are really bad for the environment as well, all in all its much better for the environment to use fossile fuels than those two things, solar farms also reflect so much light it incinerates birds that fly above them, wind farms have caused a huge decline in some species of birds, and hydro electric plants screw with the migration patterns and ecosystems of many types of aquatic life, modern nuclear plants are really safe, and as long as you have a good place to store the waste, which we do, have no negative side effects, the ones that have had horrible meltdowns were super old and didnt have the failsafes that we have now, these days a nuclear meltdown on a modern plant is extremely unlikely and could be easily contained in very little time	UCpdnhMSxLKn6XBTaDpAcH-A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpdnhMSxLKn6XBTaDpAcH-A	1	UgzMhY5ijzcyPsx17nF4AaABAg	kiyosen L.

There are some solutions, like spray enough aerosols in the air and it will eventually get to a tipping point of where it traps some heat but also blocks a decent bit out, but that is hard to do and maintain, the best solution is drop a shit ton of iron in the ocean, enough to kill a lot of fish and cause the sky to go red, which sounds crazy but it would allow the ocean to be able to regulate how much Co2 we have in the atmosphere, it has its negative effects but it could fix the climate within a few years	UCpdnhMSxLKn6XBTaDpAcH-A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpdnhMSxLKn6XBTaDpAcH-A	1	UgzMhY5ijzcyPsx17nF4AaABAg	kiyosen L.

There is no consensus as to how bad these things will get, but most scientists, definitely not 97% but most do agree that it will make weather patterns more extreme, and that sea levels will probably rise a couple feet over time, which doesnt sound like much but it would render towns like my own completely flooded, really bad storms will be more common but there is no agreement on how common they will get or how extreme they will get, the temperature extremes will get worse but who knows how much worse	UCpdnhMSxLKn6XBTaDpAcH-A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpdnhMSxLKn6XBTaDpAcH-A	1	UgzMhY5ijzcyPsx17nF4AaABAg	kiyosen L.

Global Warming is right up there with the Ozone Depletion, which another Conservative President recognized and dealt with, a 20%+ healing of the Ozone level. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- "....the most striking feature of this early age of mammals is that it was almost unbelievably hot, so hot that around 50 million years ago there were crocodiles, palm trees, and sand tiger sharks in the Arctic Circle. On the other side of the blue-green orb, in waters that today would surround Antarctica, sea-surface temperatures might have topped an unthinkable 86 degrees Fahrenheit, with near-tropical forests on Antarctica itself. There were perhaps even sprawling, febrile dead zones spanning the tropics, too hot even for animal or plant life of any sort. . This is what you get in an ancient atmosphere with around 600-1,000-1200 parts per million (ppm) of carbon dioxide. . (( humans have raised CO2 / Gas Levels from our Normal 180ppp-290ppm...Now, already up to 412ppm)) . If this number sounds familiar, 1,000 ppm of CO2 is around what humanity is on pace to reach by the end of this century. That should be mildly concerning. (( More than Mildly Concerning ! ! )) . “You put more CO2 in the atmosphere and you get more warming, that’s just super-simple physics that we figured out in the 19th century,” says David Naafs, an organic geochemist at the University of Bristol. “But exactly how much it will warm by the end of the century, we don’t know. Based on our research of these ancient climates, though, it’s probably more than we thought.”	UCt9UyYrv76HIRb_2mKix47g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt9UyYrv76HIRb_2mKix47g	1	Ugw-S6bO3bo-lhX9N8N4AaABAg	Alice Walis

This should be every individuals responsibility, among others, and people should take it very seriously. But it is quite hard to convince a lot of people to do this while one day, the so called media facing 'experts' are preaching about how you should reduce your carbon footprint, and the next, creating a carbon footprint bigger than most people could ever hope to create in a year.

The link below will give you the info you need. http://www.atmo.arizona.edu/students/courselinks/fall12/atmo336/lectures/sec5/holocene.html Also, the most recent models show that the anthropogenic component of climate change is only distinguishable from the normal variations starting in about 1940. A note on models. They are our current best estimates. For example, global climate models can't resolve the influence of clouds, they're to small, yet we know that clouds are a significant climate modulator.

Temps have been falling since then... Much of the last 1000 years were called the Little Ice Age...because of those cooling temperatures. Then, in the late 1700's, the descending temps stopped falling. Despite the fact that ALL OF THE CAUSES OF GLACIATION (ice ages) continue to this day: Earth's orbit is pulling us away from the sun (should be cooling) Earth's Axis is tilting away from the sun (should be cooling) Even Our sun's output has declined a bit over the last 50 years....

SOOOO, in who's best interest is it, for the population to believe there is a mini ice age coming. They sold Newspapers and TV stations the mini ice age myth in the 1970's....sold a million new oil furnaces during the decade too. They reran the myth in the 80's. Twice more in the 90's. Then Global Warming was declared DEAD AND GONE around 2000. Then we were approaching a Cyclical SOLAR Minimum in 2007-2009. Then we were supposed to be knee deep in it by 2018 or 2019. NOW it is supposed to be here in 2020 and we will be knee deep in it by 2030. This time it is a Russian passing the myth off as reality.

So far, the track record is not looking good for the computer models, and they also even openly admit that they do not account for all of the factors that effect the change of the climate, because many factors are completely unknown (read all of the IPCC reports). Also, the cataclysmic effects are drastically over exaggerated, there is no evidence that ACGW is going to cause mass human death. Are you claiming that global warming is going to have a noticeable effect on life expectancy?

People claim that his one time Secretary of the Interior, James Watt said it, although nobody has been able to actually produce the source, which is why so many places have now redacted the quote. From what we can tell, the first person to attribute the quote to Watt is a man named August Miles, who has been known to incorrectly attribute quotes to various people. When pressed for the source, he claimed that Watt said it on a TV show "sometime in the 70's or the 80's". Like you said, honesty is boring though, right?

He makes fun of the the 97% of Scientists in Climate Studies, understand that humans have a large Un-Natural effect on Climate Today...never witnessed in the 800,000 years of records we have. In point of Fact: -----------------------------> ( ( ( I attend an evangelical church in Milwaukee, and 8 scientists in non-climatology fields, have NEVER spoken to any Scientist in ANY field that denys largely Human causation of Global Warming & the threatening climate changes it is causing. ) ) ) ------------------------------ Michael Barnard, Low-carbon Innovation Strategist Updated Apr 26, 2017 . "Depending on the method, the many studies on this subject show that from 97.1% to 99.99% of climate scientists -- defined as researchers publishing in peer-reviewed journals -- accept that the climate is rapidly changing due to human actions. . The degree of severity they ascribe to impacts of climate change varies according to their specific areas of study and their models, but those ranges are captured in the IPCC 5 scenarios, all of which show not only warming but significant negative impacts. . The high end and very recent study shows 99.99% widespread agreement/consensus. . James L. Powell, director of the National Physical Sciences Consortium, did the most recent of Many peer-reviewed, published studies showing the overwhelming consensus by climate scientists on anthropogenic climate change. . Here's what he says: If the consensus were 97%, then to find 3 peer-reviewed articles that reject AGW, one would need to read, on average, 100 articles. Instead, to find even a single rejecting article, one must read nearly 5,000 articles. The true consensus on AGW cannot be as low as 97%. [...] The only sound and practical way to judge the extent of a scientific consensus is to search for articles that reject the prevailing theory. For 2013 and 2014, I found that only 5 of 24,210 articles and JUST 4 of 69,406 researcher/authors rejected anthropogenic global warming. . His full paper is linked from that site. Also very recently, Benestad et al published a paper in the journal Theoretical Applied Climatology in July 2015. They spread an even wider net than Powell, looking at every significant paper ever published in a peer-reviewed journal that denied anthropogenic climate change. . * They found 38 papers. * . A common denominator seems to be missing contextual information or ignoring information that does not fit the conclusions, be it other relevant work or related geophysical data. In many cases, short-comings are due to insufficient model evaluation, leading to results that are not universally valid but rather are an artifact of a particular experimental setup. Other typical weaknesses include false dichotomies, inappropriate statistical methods, or basing conclusions on misconceived or incomplete physics. [...] We also note that several of these papers involved the same authors and that the different cases were not independent even if they involved different shortcomings. Some of the cases also implied interpretations that were incompatible with some of the other cases, such as pronounced externally induced geophysical cycles and a dominant role of long-term persistence (LTP); slow stochastic fluctuations associated with LTP make the detection of meaningful cycles from solar forcing difficult if they shape the dominant character in the geophysical record. . Page on springer.com It other words, the papers don't agree with one another, they are written in fairly obvious ignorance of reasonably well known science and modelling basics and there are a handful of authors who keep writing stuff that's in denial, not a large number of them. The authors of this paper -- disclosure: I've communicated with Lewandowsky, one of the authors, many times -- bend over backward to avoid saying the obvious about the authors, instead treating them with respect and suggesting reasons why they might, possibly, maybe have just been accidentally ignorant. . But what about that 97%? . Multiple studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals show that 97 percent or more of actively publishing climate scientists agree: Climate-warming trends over the past century are very likely due to human activities. . In addition, nearly ALL of the leading scientific organizations worldwide have issued public statements endorsing this position. . Scientific Overwhelming Agreement / consensus: Earth's climate is warming . Here are the five major papers that arrived at 97%: J. Cook, et al, "Quantifying the consensus on anthropogenic global warming in the scientific literature," Environmental Research Letters Vol. 8 No. 2, (June 2013); DOI:10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024024 Quotation from page 3: "Among abstracts that expressed a position on AGW [Anthropogenic, or human-cause, Global Warming], 97.1% endorsed the scientific consensus. Among scientists who expressed a position on AGW in their abstract, 98.4% endorsed the consensus.” W. R. L. Anderegg, “Expert Credibility in Climate Change,” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Vol. 107 No. 27, 12107-12109 (21 June 2010); DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1003187107. P. T. Doran & M. K. Zimmerman, "Examining the Scientific Consensus on Climate Change," Eos Transactions American Geophysical Union Vol. 90 Issue 3 (2009), 22; DOI: 10.1029/2009EO030002. N. Oreskes, “Beyond the Ivory Tower: The Scientific Consensus on Climate Change,” Science Vol. 306 no. 5702, p. 1686 (3 December 2004); DOI: 10.1126/science.1103618. . So we have seven peer-reviewed and published papers which use different techniques, published from 2004 to 2015, which show that the consensus among climate science papers is in excess of 97% and that there are a tiny number of dissenters who are making obviously incorrect statements. 1. You can argue with one paper which has not been reproduced. 2. It's harder to argue with a paper whose results have been reproduced. 3. And it's much harder to argue with multiple different methodologies which arrive at the same result. 4. In the case of climate scientists having a very STRONG COMMON AGREEMENT or a consensus on the basics of anthropogenic climate change, consillience is extremely high.

DUH? You live in a Cooler latitude, so of course, your primary concern will be protection from the cold. There are millions more deaths from heat...if you CHOOSE to include ALL those deaths which are enabled by heat....malaria, meningitis, typhoid fever, Ebola, etc etc. That Warmer world YOU advocate means every widening latitudes that ALL of those HEAT DISEASES can migrate into ! ================= "....Climate change creates new risks, particularly in the United States, for human exposure to vector-borne diseases (VBDs) — diseases which are transmitted to humans through the bites of insects (referred to as vectors) that carry the disease-causing pathogens. . Common vectors include mosquitoes, ticks, and flies. Climate change creates new uncertainties about the spread of VBDs such as the Zika virus, dengue fever, malaria, and Lyme disease by altering conditions that affect the development and dynamics of the disease vectors and the pathogens they carry. . Rising global temperatures can lengthen the season and increase the geographic range of disease-carrying insects. As temperatures warm, mosquitoes and other warm-weather vectors can move into higher altitudes and new regions farther from the equator. For instance, in some regions in the United States, warming is lengthening the the season for Zika-carrying mosquitoes. Increased rainfall, flooding and ' humidity (( all part and parcel of of Global Warming & Climate Change )) creates more viable areas for vector breeding and allows breeding to occur more quickly, as eggs hatch faster in hotter climates. For example, officials braced for an increase in risk for Zika and West Nile virus infections after the massive flooding event in Louisiana in August 2016, which increased the breeding habitats for Aedes mosquitoes.

You reference has a lot more to do with advancements in Science/Medicine...but here you are denying science...200 years of Global Warming Research. . Can present day global warming be natural, like how a Glaciation is Normal (an ice age is natural)? (( as YOU seem to be claiming )) No, it cannot! This has been the main challenge facing climate science from the beginning: how to distinguish (initially) very small changes in temperature caused by human activity, from: a) background “noise” and b) natural processes. . The conclusion based on many different lines of scientific evidence, from independent Research Teams in 100+ nations is: a) We can clearly detect a systematic increase in global temperatures & b) There’s no other plausible explanation for this other than anthropogenic greenhouse gasses. (( Despite the Billions of Dollars Oil Industry Billionaires have lavished on Anti Global Warming Propaganda and research...NO SIGNIFICANT STUDIES HAVE SUCCEEDED in bringing into question the Tenets of Global Warming Science and the threatening Climate Changes it has triggered / which are getting worse! Yes, climate change has occurred naturally in the past. Climate experts have never needed to be reminded of this by amateur scientists. . They’ve known this for a very long time. (this Warming Ended a Natural Earth Cycle of Glaciation Prematurely / UNNATURALLY ! ...after 8,000+ years of DECLINING TEMPERATURES Toward this glaciation) . http://www.realclimate.org/images//Marcott.png So—of course—they need to be sure that the changes we are seeing are being caused by human influence… and they are. What’s more, we have a pretty darn good understanding of what has caused past, natural changes in climate. What’s happening now ' IS ' different. Climate is a “noisy” system. . . This is obvious if you look at any of the many temperature trend lines. Any given location temperature jumps up and down several degrees from year to year, appearing as “random” variations. What’s more, nighttime low temperatures show a different trend from daytime high temperatures. Yet when this noise is averaged out, most locations on earth (not all, but most!), show a clear increase in temperatures over the past probably two centuries. The year-to-year variations (scientists use the term “interannual”) are caused by variations in flow patterns in the atmosphere, ocean currents, small changes in solar activity, measurement errors, volcanic eruptions, plus other causes. Detecting the presence of a “human signal” against this background noise was difficult and was initially uncertain. As scientists are generally a skeptical lot, it took around 100 years from the time the theory of Anthropogenic (human-caused) Global Warming (AGW) was first proposed (in 1896) before it became widely accepted in the scientific community, which happened during the 1990s. . Confidence in this conclusion has grown Much stronger since then. Bear in mind that proof of AGW has come from many different lines of evidence, and many different fields of science. not just one. . We are confident in the conclusion of AGW because so many different data sets all “fit together” coherently. This would be impossible to accomplish if AGW were a “hoax” as some paranoid anti-science zealots have claimed. Increasing global temperatures are documented through land surface temperature measurements, sea surface temperatures, deep sea temperatures, atmospheric balloon measurements, satellite temperatures readings… all of which show warming. In addition, there are the indirect effects, such as migration of climatic zones northward (in the Northern Hemisphere), shrinkage of both the Southern and Northern Polar ice caps, retreat of nearly every mountain glacier in the world, plus much more. But the question, was whether these changes could represent a natural process. . The answer is “No”. There are no other known processes that can credibly explain the warming that has been observed, other than CO2, released into the atmosphere from combustion of fossil fuels. This is a clear and strong conclusion. Skeptics have suggested other POSSIBLE explanations for warming, but these have ALL been examined in detail and disproven absolutley. Nevertheless, some people continue (even a few contrarian/denier scientists) to propose the same alternative explanations that have already been shown to be false… but these people are not skeptics, but denialists. Denialism first appeared as a political ideology in the 1990s, at around the same time that scientists were becoming convinced that AGW is real. Prior to that, AGW was not viewed as a political threat, but once it became clear that earth was actually warming, and that human activity was the cause, certain political and economic interests became concerned about what the response would be…. And being a bit paranoid about powers of government, they were more afraid of the response to climate change than they were of AGW itself. Unfortunately, rather than making this the topic for disagreement (which would have been a very valid discussion), they chose an alternative approach, which was to claim that climate change was not even happening…. or if it were, that humans were not responsible. Once this viewpoint became entrenched in political ideology, people have continued to believe it, even now that the evidence for AGW is clear. Let there be no misunderstanding about this, AGW was not initially a “left wing” issue. The right-wing paranoia about government influence made it a political issue. This is very, very unfortunate, as if we stand any possibility of arresting or slowing the rate of warming, we’re losing valuable time arguing about whether the earth is flat or round."

That's a fair argument, but saying climate change isn't real because we don't live like they did 500 years ago makes 0 sense. It would be like me trying to say the earth has been shrinking in size by 5% every year, just look at how cramped cities have become! It's true that cities have become more densely populated, but that doesn't say anything about the relative size of the planet.

The number of people killed by heat and cold has to do more with access to shelter and heating/AC, and isn't evidence that a warmer earth will be safer by reducing deaths due to cold weather. The largest risks of climate change are sea level rise, species extinction, destabilization of global weather, and loss of cropland. If you really want to learn more about climate science, I HIGHLY encourage you to look outside of politics, and seek out real academic research not motivated by a political agenda.

These are not ideas which have been invented by Al Gore or Modern Science. . 1799 Alexander von Humboldt studied, worried and postulated that Human Activites / pollution would CAUSE CLIMATE CHANGE! Strip Mining entire mountain tops, Clear Cutting entire Forests, burning Coal/Peat/Wood/Oil, building huge cities which have their own climates . The First USE of " CLIMATE CHANGE " STILL in use today. . 1799 Thomas Jefferson also penned a paper on observed climate changes which he stated was probably caused by man. . "1804 : Thomas Jefferson On Climate Change | Real Science . “A change in our climate is taking place very surely. Both heat and cold are becoming moderate within the memory of even the middle-aged, and snows are less frequent and less deep.” – Thomas Jefferson 1804" 1811 Science Tied Warming, Climate Changes directly to Human Activities & Industrialization. . 1856 "....a paper entitled “Circumstances affecting the heat of the sun’s rays,” by Eunice Foote. In two brisk pages, Foote’s paper anticipated the revolution in climate science by experimentally demonstrating the effects of the sunlight on certain gases and theorizing how those gases would interact with Earth’s atmosphere for the first time. In a column of the September 1856 issue of Scientific American titled “Scientific Ladies,” Foote is praised for supporting her opinions with “practical experiments.” The writers noted: “this we are happy to say has been done by a lady.” . Foote’s research & paper demonstrated the interactions of the sun’s rays on different gases through a SERIES of experiments...." ((Variations of those fundamental Experiments are critiqued/taught in nearly every 1st year science course on colleges and Universities around the world. . 1824 Jean-Baptiste Fourier calculates that the Earth would be far colder if it lacked an atmosphere. . Svante Arrhenius (1859-1927) was a Swedish scientist that was the first to claim in 1896 that fossil fuel combustion may eventually result in enhanced global warming. . Broecker is probably best-known for popularizing the term “global warming” through his 1975 paper “Climatic Change: Are We on the Brink of a Pronounced Global Warming?” Read more: https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/lady-scientist-helped-revolutionize-climate-science-didnt-get-credit-180961291/#KKvj73exVZHRQm7u.99 .

We can research it and make it better faster than the solar and wind power.

Because of this oceans are warming, changing currents, and air is warming changing wind currents, which is why certain places may experience more extreme weather they aren't used to, cold or warm. The overall global temperature is barely increasing, maybe only a few degrees or so, but if that was the only effect it had, you would barely even feel it. Its melting the polar ice caps and changing weather patterns.

Breitbart? Daily Liar? New American?? Soooooo you trust their statements????????? WHY???????????????????????????????????? Temperatures above the arctic circle are warming 2 to 2.5 times faster than the temps. world wide. (that was a projected effect of global warming back in 1965) (The less temperature differential between temperate latitudes and the colder latitudes means more tumultuous weather, weaker jet stream stability) Here is the list of projections which I have published hundreds of times---------------------> look at #13 Central estimate of IPCC projections in recent years, they were and are still accurate & well within the projected ‘envelope. . Moreover, I added, there was and is a long track record in the scientific literature of successful predictions by climate models. It was collected and documented by Barton Paul Levenson (also linked in sidebar.) I quoted Barton as follows below . Global Warming Science & Climate Models have successfully predicted for over 60 YEARS See the AAAS & Presidential Advisory Councils Report & Warning to Presiden Johnson, 11/65 with spot on accurate Projections (not scare tactics): 1. That the globe would warm, and about how fast it would warm, and about how much it would warm. . http://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6242/1469 2. That the troposphere would warm and the stratosphere would cool. 3. That nighttime temperatures would increase more than daytime temperatures. 4. That winter temperatures would increase more than summer temperatures. 5. Polar amplification (greater temperature increase as you move toward the poles). 6. That the Arctic would warm faster than the Antarctic. 7. The magnitude (0.3 K) and duration (two years) of the cooling from the Mt. Pinatubo eruption. 8. They made a retrodiction for Last Glacial Maximum sea surface temperatures which was inconsistent with the paleo evidence, and better paleo evidence showed the models were right. 9. They predicted a trend significantly different and differently signed from UAH satellite temperatures, and then a bug was found in the satellite data. 10. The amount of water vapor feedback due to ENSO. 11. The response of southern ocean winds to the ozone hole. 12. The expansion of the Hadley cells. 13. The poleward movement of storm tracks. 14. The rising of the tropopause and the effective radiating altitude. 15. The clear sky super greenhouse effect from increased water vapor in the tropics. 16. The near constancy of relative humidity on global average. 17. That coastal up welling of ocean water would increase.

Irma in 2017 was about 65 times more costly. The reason there were so many deaths in that hurricane is because well... it was in 1900. Nowhere near as advanced technology to predict hurricane path. No phones or televisions to warn people and spread the news to evacuate. Barely anyone evacuated and that’s what happened. There are so many more preventative measures now that you can’t even compare that disaster with those today. In terms of the most intense hurricanes based on pressure and wind speed an overwhelming majority have been after 1980, with many after 2000.

Again, very few politicians are too profit from oil industry tanking. Even democratic presidents have kept the wars in the Middle East/South America. And to explain climate change, if you don’t already know, it should be obvious. There’s these things called greenhouse gases, not sure if you’ve heard of them, which absorb radiation in the atmosphere(electromagnetic waves like light, infrared etc) essentially heating up our planet. Gases like methane and carbon dioxide do this. Humans release billions of tons of these gases into the atmosphere which warms the planet. Quit simple. The majority is released by natural processes, but it’s also removed by natural processes. What we do is offsetting a crucial balance. Also deforestation, much less trees to absorb co2 further destroying the balance. The increasing temperature also melts permafrost in areas where temp isn’t supposed to be above freezing, permafrost releases methane when melting. The evidence that humans are causing immense climate change is overwhelming. The only reason past predictions haven’t come true yet is because we’ve started to try to fix the problem and reduce emissions	UC-FuH8X0RRUiUDstwgTl2EA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-FuH8X0RRUiUDstwgTl2EA	1	UgxZdsUZn8rqXoWeaah4AaABAg	Rocco Conte

To be ordained as a minister you need to publish something proving climate change. As an ordained minister you are allowed to pontificate and collect tithes. If you want to piss off a minister of climatology, or one of the myopic minions, try any of the following... 1) say "CO2 is plant food." 2) say "Polar bears are thriving." 3) say "water vapor is a vastly more important green house gas, and it's wider infrared absorption bands already cover CO2's narrow bands.(*) 4) The earth is 15% greener now than when satellites first started taking pictures. (**) 5) What ever science there once was has been hijacked by socialists. 6) Grand Solar Minimum. 7) We've had ice ages with 4,500 ppm CO2, and warm periods with 200 ppm CO2; clearly CO2 is not the control knob on the earth's temperature. 8) Termites emit way more methane than cows. 9) Why have the ice caps on Mars melted? 10) Al Gore bought seaside property; he ain't worried. (*) Al Gore said in his movie, "If you ignore the effect of water vapor, CO2 is the most powerful greenhouse gas." This is like saying, "If you ignore that man with the machine gun, the guy with the pocket knife is the most dangerous man in the room." (**) and follow this up with the reason: plants lose water to gain CO2. The 100 ppm increase has made it so that instead of losing 100 water molecules for every CO2 the plant captures, it now only loses 84. The greening has turned up around the margins of deserts, and has nothing to do with humans planting anything.

CO² occurs in such microscopic amounts in the atmosphere that multiplying it by impossible factors won't affect the planet, except for helping plants thrive. The climate change nutballs might be capable of comprehending this if they could understand simple truth. They actively seek illogical alarmism to make themselves feel better about themselves by "caring". They have chosen something impossible to affect so that "caring" is all they need to do to qualify as better than rational people. Atmospheric gasses are obviously not understood by the anthropogenic climate change believers. Anyone who believes that the building blocks of life are poison cannot comprehend simple truth. Hell, people go to tire stores and pay to have nitrogen pumped into their tires, ignorant of the fact that the original inflation of the tires used a substantial amount of compressed air. The nitrogen inflation increases the percentage of nitrogen in the tires by a small factor. It starts at +/- 78% nitrogen in the atmosphere, +/- 21% oxygen and +/- 1% all other gasses, including CO². Increasing the pressure with nitrogen will only change the percentage of nitrogen in the tire by a few points, maybe to 84 - 86%. The point is that in a microscopic environment, with a concentrated effort, man can barely effect the atmosphere. Worldwide, we effect the atmosphere on a scale akin to emptying a Super Soaker into the great lakes. Find that water.

I'm one of  the 99.99% of scientists who didn't major in climatology. And thus I don't have an agenda or a bias based on what result some funding body would like me to support nor which peer reviewed papers get accepted and published. What I am capable of doing is reading Abstracts and making an informed judgement on data and then assess models that reveal changing patterns. I don't have a bias to cherry pick models that claim to support CO2 culpable climate change and reject others. I dont agree that Correlation proves causation. E.g. We hear from WFS that deforestation has resulted in removal of 40% of the world's natural CO2 scavenger. Without photosynthesis (CO2, water and heat) as the  natural driver of the carbon cycle, we would be a desolate lifeless wasteland!! Why doesn't the alarmist want to discuss volcanism, sunspot activity wild fires, deforestation, logging and the urban sprawl? Which I'm told contributes 8x the amount of atmospheric CO2 as fossil fuel. Conclusion: the only evidence I can discover about CO2 effecting life is that a rise of 300ppm would  produce crop yields like grain and rice that are between 30 and 250% greater.

Water vapour is a much more profound greenhouse gas but can&#39;t be attacked because it&#39;s unrelated to energy. Furthermore, the oceans are the main stores of CO2, not human activity. The oceans release CO2 as temperatures warm and reabsorb CO2 when temperatures cool. CO2 follows temperature changes it does not proceed temperature changes. The &#39;movement&#39; is about taxation and attack on energy.	UCMyY1kTVGWxS43xNgplhx9Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMyY1kTVGWxS43xNgplhx9Q	0

Clouds are also low in our atmosphere just like most of the greenhouse gasses we are producing. Clouds typically only go up to about 20,000 ft int the atmosphere. The atmosphere technically doesn't have a defined border but we typically consider anything beyond ~62mi (~100km) to be in outerspace. While CO2 is good for plants, too much CO2 could have detrimental effects. I would be very interested in seeing your reference material saying that more CO2 is better and that it has to be high in the atmosphere to actually be a problem, unless that is not what you meant. Here is some simple reference material explaining different contributors and effects, they also have explanations for all of them if you click "learn more".

Very little fact, too much feelings. There are real studies done by hundreds of scientists all over the world that prove that climate change is a man made problem that should be taken seriously. The IPCC is possibly the most transparent, neutral, reliable and thorough authority on the subject and they say, without a shred of doubt, that drastic measures need to be made to prevent man made global warming on affecting many countries negatively: <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/">https://www.ipcc.ch/</a>. Stossels views are also very US centric, and doesn&#39;t realize that US:s actions on its own has also massive consequences to other countries, and its already happening in countries like Kiribati that will cease to exist in a matter of years. US is the second biggest polluter, and has one of the biggest emissions per capita in the world. Even if man made climate change happens to be a hoax where thousands of vetted scientists from all over the world agreed to take part in; in the end limited resources like oil and coal will not be needed as much, and the world will end up a bit better. One day the oil will run out, but the sun, wind, and water won&#39;t. We&#39;ll have to address the issue one day, and it&#39;s never a &quot;good time&quot; to put funds into it.

Solar Activity has been decreasing every so slightly over the last 40-50 years as World Temps. have steadily risen. . ((the last 20 year Period has been the hottest 20 Yrs. in thousands of years.)) So Don't panic, Earth is not going to freeze over. But will the resulting cooling EVEN PUT A DENT in the global warming trend? . A periodic solar event called a "grand minimum" could overtake the sun, perhaps as soon as 2018 and lasting through 2070, resulting in diminished magnetism, infrequent sunspot production and less ultraviolet (UV) radiation reaching Earth — all bringing a cooler period than might have been with Global Warming by itself. That may span 50 years. The last 'grand'-minimum event — a disruption of the sun's 11-year cycle of variable sunspot activity — happened in the mid-17th century. Known as the Maunder Minimum, it occurred between 1645 and 1715, Combined with the longer span of time when parts of the world became sufficiently cold that the period was called the Little Ice Age, which lasted from about 1300 to 1800. But it's highly unlikely that we'll see a return to the cold from centuries ago, researchers reported in a new study. Since the Maunder Minimum, global average temperatures have been on the rise, driven by climate change/Global Warming. . Though a new decades-long dip in solar radiation could slow global warming a bit...but you'll need very sensitive instruments in order to notice it.----------------------------> just 0.3 C ....... https://www.livescience.com/61716-sun-cooling-global-warming.html	UCt9UyYrv76HIRb_2mKix47g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt9UyYrv76HIRb_2mKix47g	1	Ugw6-8i03YOhTiiA1hl4AaABAg	David Steenson

"The notion that climate scientists either invented or exaggerated global warming is one that’s been rumbling around for quite some time. . It’s often used as an argument to oppose the theory of global warming but it’s not something that has ever been substantiated –despite numerous requests for links to corroborating evidence. . It’s actually quite a bizarre claim given that global warming will be celebrating it’s 200th birthday in a few days. 1. The first scientific connection to global warming dates from 1811 when the physicist and astronomer Simeon Denis Poisson speculated that atmospheric pollution led to increased temperatures. 2. In 1824 the French scientist Jean-Baptiste Fourier (a colleague of Poisson’s) put forward the notion that Earth's atmosphere was retaining heat. His published his findings in a work entitled “General Remarks on the Temperature of the Terrestrial Globe & the Planetary Spaces” http://burgess1837.geologist-1011.mobi/ 3. 1856 "...the work of Eunice Foote, who three years prior to the start of Tyndall's laboratory research, conducted similar experiments on absorption of radiant energy by atmospheric gases, such as CO2 and water vapor. . The presentation of her report at a major scientific convention in 1856 was accompanied by postulation that even modest increases in the concentration of CO2 could result in significant atmospheric warming." www.searchanddiscovery.com/.. 4. In 1896 the Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius was the first person to produce documented empirical evidence as to the existence of global warming, this was published in his paper "On the Influence of Carbonic Acid in the Air upon the Temperature of the Ground" (carbonic acid being the chemical name of the time for carbon dioxide). http://www.rsc.org/images/Arrhenius1896_... . It’s sometimes claimed that scientists falsify the theory of global warming in order to receive funding. . The problem with this argument is that any funding that is provided will be strictly controlled and in most cases will be monitored and audited by the funding institution or by the funding body and / or their appointed auditors. . ANY deliberate misappropriation of funding would be a criminal offence for which the offender could be jailed. This has never happened. The Virginia State Attorney – Ken Cuccinelli – embarked on something of a witch-hunt against the climate scientist Michael Mann and invoked the ** Virginia Fraud Against Taxpayers Act claiming that Mann had misappropriated public funds by producing DOCTORED and/or FRAUDULENT DATA to support the Global Warming THESIS. The Judge threw the case out.--------------> http://www.ucsusa.org/news/press_release... NEWS MEDIA DESCRIBED THE CASE as having been "LAUGHED OUT OF COURT" . I’m actually a climate scientist myself and I can assure you that it’s nothing to do with the money (I work in the private sector so there’s almost no public funding available). Anyone embarking on a climate science study course is well aware that they’re never going to become rich. . If they were more concerned about money they would use their scientific background and work in petrochemicals or pharmaceuticals. It’s also assumed that climate scientists do nothing other than study climate change. In reality, this makes up a small proportion of the workload and many scientists will go through their whole career without ever researching climate change. The argument falls flat on it’s face yet again when you consider that companies with the most to lose from climate change being a reality –the oil and power companies – have their own in-house climate scientists and they are reporting exactly the same as those working in the public sector. . Furthermore, climate change is a multi-disciplinary subject and involves scientists from a wide spectrum including botanists, marine biologists, oceanographers, cosmologists, physicists, atmospheric chemists etc. . *It stretches credibility beyond all forms of reason to believe that such a huge number of people could be involved in a scam and not one person has ever spoken out. It’s also worth bearing in mind that the first warnings made to the US government about impending climate change came from research conducted by the US Army at the Camp Century base in Greenland. . Are we also to believe that the military are also involved in some sort of global conspiracy? PS – The psychological aspect of climate change can be found within the realms of the psychology of denial and the diffusion of responsibility. These conditions manifest themselves as a) a filter mechanism that inhibits the acceptance of conflicting ideas and opinions in order to maintain a delusion and b) the reluctance to become involved on the basis that someone else will deal with the problem.

He has painstakingly examined and tabulated all NASA GISS’s temperature data series, taken from 1153 stations and going back to 1881. His conclusion: that if you look at the raw data, as opposed to NASA’s revisions, you’ll find that since 1940 the planet has been cooling, not warming.

He has never published any research on climate in a peer-reviewed climate science journal, nor does he belong to any association of climate scientists. you do understand what a peer reviewed paper is? otherwise anyone can claim to be a dr and publish anything. the earth is flat etc... So his assertions about climate have exactly the same authoritativeness as those my dentist might make. secondly nasa are not the only ppl collecting data. there is a world outside the US, . about 6.7 billion ppl livng and some of those ppl are scientists collecting data and have nothing to do with the american govn or Nasa cities across the globe are recording the highest temperatures worldwide since those records started. so are sea temperatures ice caps are melting like the greenland one at its fasted rate. look at global weather patterns, storms, heatwaves, ... all the records are showing greater rises than wat would normally b attributed to global weather paterns rise and falls. to deny the science is ridiculous. the affects we can already c and the issue is how worse will it get. well we dont know. depends on how much more the temperatures will rise. the people who deny the science are politicians who are being paid by lobby groups. how interesting that its only USA that is mainly in the denial. also so happens to be the biggest country to rely on coal fired power stations. interesting. any scientist can say watever they want. but to be pear reviewed is another thing. someone who is qualified to evaluate your study. there is more evidence for global warming then for smoking cigarettes leads to cancer and yet no one debates the cancer issue	UCXpHZVw0s9npFcxM7dgiMRg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXpHZVw0s9npFcxM7dgiMRg	1	UgxPmwLHzUABh9c_nbF4AaABAg	Tony T.

This would mean a lot of species go extinct and can potentially cause a chain reaction that in turn reduces marine Resource and sea level rises. This would creates more refugee problem. You also forget the fact that natural disasters like Cyclones and Tsunami will scale with the sea level rises. As Penisula and Antarctic free up for resources you could see countries competing and make it more worse. The climate change doesn&#39;t directly kill people like this moustached fool in the video wanks on about. It&#39;s effects are Indirect causing destruction of ecosystems. When you don&#39;t have enough resources what do you get? Conflicts. <br /><br />If the marine life like fish become less prevalent due to their migration to adjust to the temperature what would happen? It would devastate countries whi rely on fishing on startegic spots and potentially plummets the whole world into another economic crisis.

The 1969 fire, which did not incur maximum damages or fatally wound any citizen, was the most covered incident occuring on the river.<br />This was in part because of the developing precedence that sanitation held over industrial actions; the United States was becoming more eco-aware.<br />.<br />Also, due to the shift from industry to technology, waste dumping to recycling Time Magazine produced an article about the incident. This brought mass amount of attention to the Cleveland area<br />and added pressure for hygienic regulation.<br /><br />Inspired by the 1969 river fire,<br />Congress was determined to resolve the issue of land pollution, not just in Cleveland, but throughout the United States.<br />.<br />The legislature passed the National Environment Protection Act (NEPA) which was signed into law on January 1, 1970. This act helped establish the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) which would be given the duties to manage environmental risks and regulate various sanitary-specific policies.<br />.<br />One of the first legislations that the EPA put-forth was the Clean Water Act (1972), which mandated that all rivers throughout the United States be hygienic enough to safely allow mass amounts of swimmers and fish within the water by 1983. Since the 1969 Cuyahoga River fire the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District has invested over $3.5 billion towards the purification of the river and the development of new sewer systems. There is a projection that over the next thirty years the city of Cleveland will further endow over $5 billion to the upkeep of the wastewater system.<br /><br />The river is now home to about sixty different species of fish, there has not been another river fire since 1969, and yearly new waste management programs develop to ensure the sanitation of Cleveland&#39;s waterways....&quot;	UCt9UyYrv76HIRb_2mKix47g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt9UyYrv76HIRb_2mKix47g	0

Can you not read a graph? http://www.columbia.edu/~mhs119/Temperature/ and the reason the temperature is rising is HUMAN caused greenhouse gases, the major natural forcings are actually COOLING the earth (TSI and Milankovitch cycles). Didn't you know that? Oh, and global warming will be bad, the Trump administration just released a report on HOW bad it will be. John Stossel: Not a scientist and not too bright, either.

Then you lie and say my best case was a debunked survey. Falsely debunked by the side who wants to discredit it. It was signed by over 31,000 scientists, of which one-third of them have PhDs...overwhelming evidence that there is no majority scientific consensus in global warming as a threat to the planet...which the Left has lied about repeatedly in order to push their agenda. And you think chemtrails are a conspiracy theory? I used to think the same thing until I found out that it is public knowledge admitted to by various government authorities...even going for decades...as weather modification programs have long existed before now. You can look it up yourself you lazy thing...as that is the reason you're too lazy to watch the videos I posted..but would rather lie and say they mean nothing since they were posted on YouTube....I mean how stupid of an argument is that...saying it isn't credible because it's posted on YouTube?? That's laughable...and I guess with that logic, your comments aren't credible since they are posted RIGHT HERE on YouTube. Your arguments hold no water whatsoever.

The petition's purpose is to argue that there is no consensus on climate change. The petition website currently lists 31,000 signatures, although the credentials of those signing it are unknown, and the authenticity is disputed." Fail. Debunked. The fact that you cite a survey circulated since 1999 and debunked soon after tells me you don't understand actual evidence.

My guess is almost every single one of them will tell you to go to a doctor - who got their information from - wait for it - a scientist.<br /><br />Alternately, feel free to ignore those scientists too. There&#39;s nothing like enjoying the outcome of a self-correcting problem. Good luck with that.	UCse3qxZXwaYsk710S8HtGfA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCse3qxZXwaYsk710S8HtGfA	0

Try finding real scientists that disagree with that.

NO PAUSE in Global Warming ! ..... NONE! 2. NO HIATUS in Global Warming! ..... NONE! 3. Sure as hell, > NO COOLING ! ....,,,..NONE! . Dr. SPENCER: “my UAH cohort & boss John Christy, who does the detailed matching between satellites, is pretty convinced that the RSS data is undergoing SPURIOUS COOLING because RSS is still using the old NOAA-15 satellite which has a decaying orbit..."

By the end of the 70s, Fossil Fuel Industry succeeded in selling over a million oil furnaces ... based on the " FEAR " of a " MINI ICE AGE " ....and defeated ANY efforts to mitigate Global Warming /Climate Change in the future. This Propaganda Technique was used in the '80s, in the '90s...changed a bit around 2000 when they started saying the GLOBAL WARMING was going to "PAUSE", was in "HIATUS", and was, again, leading to Global Cooling. . How did that Right Wing Prediction work out? . Noted Skeptics Dr. Roy Spencer & Dr. John Christie have recently admitted that Global Warming continued, unpaused, by 0.14C per decade...nearly triple their predicted amount SINCE the 1970s. . 18 of the 19 Hottest Years on Record Have Occurred Since 2001 https://uproxx.com/news/warmest-years-on-earth The five hottest years have all been in the past five years. What’s more: 18 of the 19 hottest years on record have occurred since 2001. ================ The last 'grand'-minimum event — a disruption of the sun's 11-year cycle of variable sunspot activity — happened in the mid-17th century. Known as the Maunder Minimum, it occurred between 1645 and 1715, Combined with the longer span of time when parts of the world became sufficiently cold that the period was called the Little Ice Age, which lasted from about 1300 to 1800. But it's HIGHLY UNLIKELY that we'll see a return to the cold from centuries ago, researchers reported in a new study. Since the Maunder Minimum, global average temperatures have been on the rise, driven by Global Warming created Climate Changes. .

The best bet is simply quit subsidizing those things causing AGW. ((world wide, Fossil Fuels & connected industries TAKE 6.5% of GDP ..TRILLIONS in subsidies/ supports))) . In most cases the newer more modern energy and agricultural systems are more profitable and less damaging to the environment already. So there is no need to tax people to subsidize those things harming the environment, then taxing us again to penalize those same ones we just subsidized! A house divided against itself cannot stand. -Lincoln (paraphrasing the Bible) It is time for a strong political leader to take charge and end this deadlock. We could either reduce taxes and let the new technologies out compete the obsolete systems we depend on now, or we could keep taxes the same and simply redirect the subsidies we use for fossil fuels and destructive industrialized agriculture towards modern sustainable systems instead. The one thing that won’t work is keep the tax and spend schemes the Neo-Luddites have made for themselves now, and also add even more tax and spend schemes for their competing new technologies too! Yes that’s right, the top two causes for global warming are heavily subsidized.[1][2][3][4] It is literally insanity. in·san·i·ty in'san?de/ noun the state of being seriously mentally ill; extreme foolishness or irrationality. We can reverse AGW though, and save money doing it. Here are three proposals. One made by me and two more similar ones. Here you can see how some might include a carbon market and ways we could do it without a carbon market. They are all workable. The main thing is that they are all stand alone solutions that have beneficial sides effects instead of detrimental side effects to the land and society. We should do them even if AGW wasn’t real. They would still be hugely beneficial all around. There is no negative down side. Win/win for all. Credit: Joel Pett | USA Today 1] Scott Strough's answer to Can we reverse global warming? Executive summary: Yes we can reverse Global Warming. It does not require huge tax increases or overly expensive untested risky technologies. It will require a three pronged approach worldwide. 1] Reduce fossil fuel use by replacing energy needs with as many feasible renewables as current technology allows. . ((solar & wind Cost less & are quicker to construct + + they produce FAR less expensive electricity than coal)) . Change Agricultural methods to high yielding regenerative models of production made possible by recent biological & agricultural science advancements. Large scale ecosystem recovery projects similar to the Loess Plateau project, National Parks like Yellowstone etc. where appropriate and applicable. 2] Project Drawdown The list is comprised primarily of “no regrets” solutions—actions that make sense to take regardless of their climate impact since they have intrinsic benefits to communities and economies. These initiatives improve lives, create jobs, restore the environment, enhance security, generate resilience, and advance human health.[5] 3] Farming a climate change solution Farmers have a golden solution to global warming largely missed by climate change pundits, right beneath their feet. The innovative Australian Soil Carbon Accreditation Scheme is showing how incentive payments can be received by landholders for measurable increases in soil carbon that soaks up CO2 from the atmosphere. Financial incentives could help fund soil restoration efforts, which in turn bring the bonus of greater productivity, drought resilience and even rain. The action is deep underground.[6] Footnotes [1] The $200 Billion Fossil Fuel Subsidy You've Never Heard Of (USA) [2] Fossil fuel subsidies are a staggering $5 tn per year | John Abraham [3] Fossil Fuel Subsidies Top $450 Billion Annually, Study Says (USA w various costs,supports) [4] Milking taxpayers [5] Solutions | Drawdown [6] http://www.amazingcarbon.com/PDF...

Holocene inter glacial warm Period Peaked 7500-8500 years ago. Since then temps have slowly falling toward the next glaciation tens of thousands of years from now. . BUT that came to a sudden observable halt in the late 1700's. Thomas Jefferson/John Adams discussed these occurrences from 1799-1804. While all other major cycles POINT to COOLING.....we are warming.

NASA and NOAH have recorded this. 13 of 14 of the hottest years occurred this century. Published papers from 1965 to 1979, about 66 percent indicate the globe is warming, about 20 percent say the indicate the globe&#39;s temperature is stable, the last 14 percent indicate the globe is cooling. <br /> <br />From 1993 to 2015, sea levels have risen an average of 3 millimeters per year. Ice on Antarctica and Greenland have been melting at unprecedented rates. Arctic Sea ice is continuing to decline. Don&#39;t forget about the new shipping lanes have opened through the Arctic, allowing ships to bypass the Panama Canal. <br /> <br />The Sun is not a factor in the Earth&#39;s rising temperature. Since 1960 the Sun&#39;s solar output has been slowing declining AND the earth&#39;s temperature has rapidly increasing. <br /> <br />It&#39;s true that humans output about 30 Billion tons CO2 yearly and it&#39;s just a fraction compared 720 Billion tons output yearly by natural sea and land processes. But this does NOT mean humans are not responsible for it. The system was balanced by land and oceans absorbing that same amount. This balance kept CO2 in the atmosphere between 180 and 280 ppm for 800,000 years. Now it&#39;s at about 400 ppm and still rising. <b>*Yes this is man made CO2 because the man made isotope carbon 13 is less common in fossil fuels than it is naturally found in the atmosphere. Over time we have seen the concentrations of carbon 13 decreasing.*</b> BTW Volcanoes emit about 0.25 Billion tons of CO2, not a big factor in CO2 output. <br /> <br />Warmer air can absorb more moisture than colder air. Warmer air and warmer water contain more energy giving hurricanes more destructive power (Hurricanes Andrew, Irma, and Maria). Melting ice reduces the reflectivity of the Earth&#39;s surface allowing more sunlight to warm up the atmosphere. This ongoing feedback loop will cause an increase of 3 deg Celsius in the atmosphere.

The left prefer to listen to the few economists who agree with them, even if there are more many economists who say otherwise. These guys on the right listen to the few scientists who agree with them. This video states that there is no economic model that can predict the future, but nonetheless we can use rational thinking and data to see that socialism would never work. But when it comes to greenhouse gases we know that CO2 has the effect of warming the planet and that we dont know whats the tipping point, but we know that the pace is going faster then ever and that is the problem, since nature has a hard time to addapt. Even if it is not: should we gamble when the odds are against us? Venus for exemple is much hotter than mercury, due to the green house effect. I just think that the same irrational thinking that the leftists use toward economy, the right is using against pollution	UCyNWYZla23M9FRP6hz6-IfQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyNWYZla23M9FRP6hz6-IfQ	0

The issue with climate change is that it drastically changes Earth’s environment and ecosystems which in the end will affect us from our food supply to wars over water. We are seeing the 2nd largest biodiversity loss in Earth’s history. Yes the Earth’s climate changes, but over very long timescales. The changes we are seeing are happing across decades which can only be explained by human activity. We can debate about how to best solve the issue, but pretending the problem doesn’t exist isn’t helping anyone.	UCgAiw0NI6F6IqUx_wWG2z4g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgAiw0NI6F6IqUx_wWG2z4g	0

Multiple studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals show that 97 percent or more of actively publishing climate scientists agree: Climate-warming trends over the past century are very likely due to human activities. . In addition, nearly ALL of the leading scientific organizations worldwide have issued public statements endorsing this position. . Scientific Overwhelming Agreement / consensus: Earth's climate is warming . Here are the five major papers that arrived at 97%: J. Cook, et al, "Quantifying the consensus on anthropogenic global warming in the scientific literature," Environmental Research Letters Vol. 8 No. 2, (June 2013); DOI:10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024024 Quotation from page 3: "Among abstracts that expressed a position on AGW [Anthropogenic, or human-cause, Global Warming], 97.1% endorsed the scientific consensus. Among scientists who expressed a position on AGW in their abstract, 98.4% endorsed the consensus.” W. R. L. Anderegg, “Expert Credibility in Climate Change,” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Vol. 107 No. 27, 12107-12109 (21 June 2010); DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1003187107. P. T. Doran & M. K. Zimmerman, "Examining the Scientific Consensus on Climate Change," Eos Transactions American Geophysical Union Vol. 90 Issue 3 (2009), 22; DOI: 10.1029/2009EO030002. N. Oreskes, “Beyond the Ivory Tower: The Scientific Consensus on Climate Change,” Science Vol. 306 no. 5702, p. 1686 (3 December 2004); DOI: 10.1126/science.1103618. . So we have seven peer-reviewed and published papers which use different techniques, published from 2004 to 2015, which show that the consensus among climate science papers is in excess of 97% and that there are a tiny number of dissenters who are making obviously incorrect statements. 1. You can argue with one paper which has not been reproduced. 2. It's harder to argue with a paper whose results have been reproduced. 3. And it's much harder to argue with multiple different methodologies which arrive at the same result. 4. In the case of climate scientists having a very STRONG COMMON AGREMENT or a consensus on the basics of anthropogenic climate change, consilience is extremely high.

If you agree that there is increased carbon dioxide and temps I don&#39;t see the argument around the sea. Water will react with co2 to make a more acidic substance, and combined with recent abnormal weather conditions and rising temperatures it has killed off many coral reefs, water based ecosystems. The thing with ecosystems is everything is connected. More than 50 percent of the world&#39;s population lives by the sea, and it could effect economies around the world.

The vast majority of Temperature Adjustments appear to amateur eyes to lessen the appearance of Global warming !--------------------> Despite the incessant din of Rabid Right PRO FOSSIL BILLIONAIRES PR Dept.s. Even Well Known Deniers/Skeptics defend temperature Adjustments to correct erroneous data sets... For example, An Arctic Ground Station that fails...continues to send out 0 degrees as a temps set when batteries fail....yet current temps across the Arctic are 25 below to 65 below zero....that WOULD look like an increase in temps...and it may take months to organize a crew and get on site to effect repairs. . 2nd. If you get all of YOUR information from the likes of Daily Caller, Breitbart, New American, I can understand your Comment about so-called failed predictions. IF you had read any scientific journal, you would see reported successful projections in EVERY JOURNAL every MONTH ! BUT, GLOBAL WARMING and RESULTING CLIMATE CHANGES do not depend upon CLIMATE MODELS but on millions of human observations and measurements....dating back 200 years. CLIMATE CHANGE, for example, was 1st LABELED AND DEFINED in 1799 by Alexander von Humboldt! With in months, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams were discussing CLIMATE CHANGE. 1811 science had already tied those CLIMATE CHANGES to human activities: Clear Cutting Entire forests, building large Weather changing cities, burning wood, oil, coal, peat, pitch for warmth for a growing population, strip mining entire mountain tops etc. --------------------------- there was and is a long track record in the scientific literature of successful predictions by climate models. It was collected and documented by Barton Paul Levenson (also linked in sidebar.) I quoted Barton as follows below: Global Warming Science & Climate Models have successfully predicted for over 60 YEARS: 1. That the globe would warm, and about how fast, and about how much. . http://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6242/1469 2. That the troposphere would warm and the stratosphere would cool. 3. That nighttime temperatures would increase more than daytime temperatures. 4. That winter temperatures would increase more than summer temperatures. 5. Polar amplification (greater temperature increase as you move toward the poles). 6. That the Arctic would warm faster than the Antarctic. 7. The magnitude (0.3 K) and duration (two years) of the cooling from the Mt. Pinatubo eruption. 8. They made a retrodiction for Last Glacial Maximum sea surface temperatures which was inconsistent with the paleo evidence, and better paleo evidence showed the models were right. 9. They predicted a trend significantly different and differently signed from UAH satellite temperatures, and then a bug was found in the satellite data. 10. The amount of water vapor feedback due to ENSO. 11. The response of southern ocean winds to the ozone hole. 12. The expansion of the Hadley cells. 13. The poleward movement of storm tracks. 14. The rising of the tropopause and the effective radiating altitude. 15. The clear sky super greenhouse effect from increased water vapor in the tropics. 16. The near constancy of relative humidity on global average. 17. That coastal upwelling of ocean water would increase. ---------------- Broecker is probably best-known for popularizing the term “global warming” through his 1975 paper “Climatic Change: Are We on the Brink of a Pronounced Global Warming?” ---------------- https://www.nrdc.org/stories/global-warming-101#warming https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Global_Temperature_Anomaly.svg https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/ ---------------------- The planet IS accumulating heat !

UgwhQ7lHWehBXfII-6Z4AaABAg.8rU3stbr8Sw8rnSrDUnsYn		1	2019-02-26 01:58:06	Rick Kooi	@Andrew Black There is really a COMMON OVERWHELMING AGREEMENT otherwise known as consensus on global warming in the Scientific Community, actively Working on / Studying this phenomenon or who had been working in these fields from EVERY NATION ON EARTH ? ( I attend an evangelical church in Milwaukee, with 8 scientists in non-climatology fields, have NEVER spoken to ANY Scientist in ANY field that denies largely Human causation of Global Warming & the threatening climate changes it is causing.) . Michael Barnard, Low-carbon Innovation Strategist Updated Apr 26, 2017 . "Depending on the method, the many studies on this subject show that from 97.1% to 99.99% of climate scientists -- defined as researchers publishing in peer-reviewed journals -- accept that the climate is rapidly changing due to human actions. . The degree of severity they ascribe to impacts of climate change varies according to their specific areas of study and their models, but those ranges are captured in the IPCC 5 scenarios, all of which show not only warming but significant negative impacts. . -----------------------> The high end and very recent study shows 99.99% widespread agreement/consensus. . James L. Powell, director of the National Physical Sciences Consortium, did the most recent of Many peer-reviewed, published studies showing the overwhelming consensus by climate scientists on anthropogenic climate change. . Here's what he says: If the consensus were 97%, then to find 3 peer-reviewed articles that reject AGW, one would need to read, on average, 100 articles. Instead, to find even a single rejecting article, one must read nearly 5,000 articles. . The true consensus on AGW cannot be as low as 97%. [...] The only sound and practical way to judge the extent of a scientific consensus is to search for articles that reject the prevailing theory. For 2013 and 2014, I found that only 5 of 24,210 articles and JUST 4 of 69,406 researcher/authors rejected anthropogenic global warming. . His full paper is linked from that site. Also very recently, Benestad et al published a paper in the journal Theoretical Applied Climatology in July 2015. . They spread an even wider net than Powell, looking at every significant paper ever published in a peer-reviewed journal that denied anthropogenic climate change. . * ----------------------> They found JUST 38 papers. * . A common denominator seems to be missing contextual information or ignoring information that does not fit the conclusions, be it other relevant work or related geophysical data. In many cases, short-comings are due to insufficient model evaluation, leading to results that are not universally valid but rather are an artifact of a particular experimental setup. Other typical weaknesses include false dichotomies, inappropriate statistical methods, or basing conclusions on misconceived or incomplete physics. [...] We also note that several of these papers involved the same authors and that the different cases were not independent even if they involved different shortcomings. Some of the cases also implied interpretations that were incompatible with some of the other cases, such as pronounced externally induced geophysical cycles and a dominant role of long-term persistence (LTP); slow stochastic fluctuations associated with LTP make the detection of meaningful cycles from solar forcing difficult if they shape the dominant character in the geophysical record. . Page on springer.com It other words, the papers don't agree with one another, they are written in fairly obvious ignorance of reasonably well known science and modelling basics and there are a handful of authors who keep writing stuff that's in denial, not a large number of them. The authors of this paper -- disclosure: I've communicated with Lewandowsky, one of the authors, many times -- bend over backward to avoid saying the obvious about the authors, instead treating them with respect and suggesting reasons why they might, possibly, maybe have just been accidentally ignorant. . But what about that 97%? . Multiple studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals show that 97 percent or more of actively publishing climate scientists agree: Climate-warming trends over the past century are very likely due to human activities. . In addition, nearly ALL of the leading scientific organizations worldwide have issued public statements endorsing this position. . Scientific Overwhelming Agreement / consensus: Earth's climate is warming . Here are the five major papers that arrived at 97%: J. Cook, et al, "Quantifying the consensus on anthropogenic global warming in the scientific literature," Environmental Research Letters Vol. 8 No. 2, (June 2013); DOI:10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024024 Quotation from page 3: "Among abstracts that expressed a position on AGW [Anthropogenic, or human-cause, Global Warming], 97.1% endorsed the scientific consensus. Among scientists who expressed a position on AGW in their abstract, 98.4% endorsed the consensus.” W. R. L. Anderegg, “Expert Credibility in Climate Change,” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Vol. 107 No. 27, 12107-12109 (21 June 2010); DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1003187107. P. T. Doran & M. K. Zimmerman, "Examining the Scientific Consensus on Climate Change," Eos Transactions American Geophysical Union Vol. 90 Issue 3 (2009), 22; DOI: 10.1029/2009EO030002. N. Oreskes, “Beyond the Ivory Tower: The Scientific Consensus on Climate Change,” Science Vol. 306 no. 5702, p. 1686 (3 December 2004); DOI: 10.1126/science.1103618. . So we have seven peer-reviewed and published papers which use different techniques, published from 2004 to 2015, which show that the consensus among climate science papers is in excess of 97% and that there are a tiny number of dissenters who are making obviously incorrect statements. 1. You can argue with one paper which has not been reproduced. 2. It's harder to argue with a paper whose results have been reproduced. 3. And it's much harder to argue with multiple different methodologies which arrive at the same result. 4. In the case of climate scientists having a very STRONG COMMON AGREMENT or a consensus on the basics of anthropogenic climate change, consilience is extremely high.

While the climate change doomsayers constantly harp about global warming, climate blogger Tony Heller reported on November 13(2016) that over the last eight months, global temperatures over land have cooled a record 1.2°C. " ------------- (( Over 1700 out of 1763 TV Stations in the USA reported that 2016 was a SCORCHER Record hot YEAR)) ------------- Take a look at NOTED Denier's UAH data for 2016--reports a dramatic record hot year. --- http://www.drroyspencer.com/wp-content/uploads/UAH-v6-LT-NExt-thru-feb-2016-2.jpg ------------ LOOK: " TONY HELLER (aka Steven Goddard) TESTIFIED that temperatures had fallen a remarkable 1.2C" ------------ Tony Heller’s findings were charted on a graph posted on the website realclimatescience.com. A biographical sketch on the International Conferences on Climate Change website created by the Heartland Institute notes that Heller “has spent much of the past seven years studying the history of extreme weather, as well as the history and methodology behind the reported NOAA/NASA temperature record.” (( ----TONY HELLER aka Steven Goddard is an electrical Engineer & has never studied climate & never reported or published any actual research----)) "While this latest report may come as a surprise to many people, longtime readers of The New American will not be among them.

God damn, Someone needs to tell John that the melting of the ice caps increases the overall water on the planet, which increases the moisture in the atmosphere, which makes the winter seasons more intense. That&#39;s right kids, global warming is year round, it doesn&#39;t just make your summer beach trip a little sweatier. This is the silliest thing I&#39;ve seen on youtube in at least a week.<br /><br />God, that part about a solar subsidy hurting the poor, the hits just keep on coming in this video, a subsidy only hurts the poor if the country&#39;s tax system is unfair, that&#39;s like calling the drying of a watering hole a bad thing because it robs the lions of an easy hunting ground. And that part ripped straight from the Rupert Murdoch machine narrative, that it&#39;s all a conspiracy theory, that ooo, climate scientist need to push a narrative so that they can buy new jet ski&#39;s. The idea that scientists somehow need this drama in their lives is just laughable. There are a million things they&#39;d rather be researching, things that haven&#39;t already been settled yet, ya know, that&#39;s kind of what scientific research is for. Instead they have this duty to the public to keep harping on this one tired and settled debate, because some Oil Executive keeps dolling out wads of cash to conservative PAC&#39;s to fight them.<br /><br />I mean, Jesus, it&#39;s already been proven that Shell is and has been fully aware of climate change and their company&#39;s own impact on it, they&#39;re just slowing down the public&#39;s action so they can milk as much money as they can from their current technology set and production plans. The second the world runs out of oil or the public finally turns against it, they&#39;ll have already made sure that they, and only they, have the proper patents to ensure ownership of the future generation of clean energy. It&#39;s not a conspiracy theory, so much as they just all think alike, they&#39;re getting ahead of the competition, and they&#39;re duping the easily duped to give them the time they need.

First of all, the fossil fuels are a very limited resource and once they end they are not easily coming back as they are non renewable resources. Currently the cost of alternative energy is still high, but we will research how to lower the cost of alternative energy until it becomes affordable. It is only a matter of time before putting solar panels on your house and battery cost less than the electric bill in the future. Then once we make the $5000 to $10,000 electric car, dealers won&#39;t know what to do with all that gas guzzling inventory they built up. It is coming slowly and steadily and once that happens, all government subsidies will end since the free market will become enough for alternative energy. But the problem is the huge dependence on fossil fuels and we can&#39;t get out of this situation easily. We also have the dependence on debt to worry about. Carbon Dioxide itself is not the poison, but the fact it is the most emitted greenhouse gas is important since water gets to join the water cycle and carbon dioxide acidifies the ocean.

UgxZmFb2ovZYsiYqiBd4AaABAg	34	31	2019-02-17 05:52:01	Anders Welander	I&#39;m a scientist with a PhD in physics. A number of years ago I began to study the climate issue because I had been hearing so many insane statements from politicians. I can only conclude what I knew from the beginning that there&#39;s no way to predict how the climate will evolve in the future. Even if we could install a planetary climate control system, what temperature should we set it to? What will please future generations the most? Finally, even if the control system could be installed and the best temperature setting established there will still remain the problem that it will cost 1 billion times more than it&#39;s worth!<br />We don&#39;t know how CO2 varied before direct measurements. The ice cores don&#39;t show fluctuations on shorter time scales. There&#39;s reason to believe the current rise is mainly natural. There is carbon in the air, there is carbon in living things, there is carbon in dead things, some of the dead stuff is coal and oil. There&#39;s a huge reserve of carbon that is already in circulation. We&#39;re just adding a little. CO2 is the gas that produces life. It&#39;s the last step before a carbon atom contributes to life. Now they want to stop that atom. The greenhouse effect from CO2 is negligible. The assumption how water vapor depends on CO2 is useless speculation. Modeling of clouds is very hard. Even if all that modeling stuff is improved there will still remain the things we don&#39;t that we don&#39;t know.<br />The good news is there&#39;s no reason to worry about the CO2.<br />The bad news is Western civilization is under constant attacks from leftists that are coming up with one insane plan after another for how to destroy all we hold dear.

Coinciding with Earth's farthest orbit swing away from the sun, Earth's Northern Axis is also tilted away from the Sun ! THAT is a 100,000 year cycle which is a trigger of the Malinkovitch Cycles. . Again, you have to question ((( WHY IS IT NOT COOLING ? ))) * * * * * "....summary of 10 direct, measured lines of empirical evidence that point to human-induced climate change. In some cases, I have added layman's references in addition to the more rigorous citations Burning Fossil Fuels Correlates with Rising CO2. Humans are currently emitting around 30 billion tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere every year (CDIAC(ornl.gov)). Human Activities produce 100+ times MORE CO2 than all of the Volcanoes on Earth Combined, EVERY YEAR! ( 0.3 billions tons by volcanoes versus 30 billion tons by mankind.) Of course, it could be coincidence that CO2 levels are rising so sharply at the same time so let's look at more evidence that we're responsible for the rise in CO2 levels. . The proportion of Carbon-12 is increasing. (a distinct Burning-Fossil-Fuel isotope) . When we measure the type of carbon accumulating in the atmosphere, we observe more of the type of carbon that comes from fossil fuels (Manning 2006 (noaa.gov)). [Blog explanation: How do we know that recent CO<sub>2</sub> increases are due to human activities? (realclimate.org)] . Oxygen Levels Dropping. This is corroborated by measurements of oxygen in the atmosphere. (at over 100 locations world wide) . Oxygen levels are falling in line with the amount of carbon dioxide rising, just as you'd expect from fossil fuel burning which takes oxygen out of the air to create carbon dioxide (Manning 2006 (noaa.gov)). . Coral Also Confirms They're Fossil Carbons. Further independent evidence that humans are raising CO2 levels comes from measurements of carbon found in coral records going back several centuries. These find a recent sharp rise in the type of carbon that comes from fossil fuels ( Pelejero 2005 (sciencemag.org)). . More Heat is Being Trapped at CO2's (& nearly 2dz. other gasses) Wavelength. So we know humans are raising CO2 levels. What's the effect? Multiple Satellites (multiple nations) measure less heat escaping out to space, at the particular wavelengths that CO2 absorbs heat, thus finding "direct experimental evidence for a significant increase in the Earth's greenhouse effect". . (Harries 2001 (nature.com), (Griggs 2004 (aip.org), (Chen 2007 (eumetsat.eu)). . More Downward Infrared Radiation. . If less heat is escaping to space, > > where is it going? . MUCH of it is Back to the Earth's surface. Surface measurements confirm this, observing more downward infrared radiation (Philipona 2004 (agu.org), (Wang 2009 (agu.org)). . A closer look at the downward radiation finds more heat returning at CO2 wavelengths, leading to the conclusion that "this experimental data should effectively end the argument by skeptics that no experimental evidence exists for the connection between greenhouse gas increases in the atmosphere and global warming." (Evans 2006 (confex.com)). . It's Not the Sun If an increased greenhouse effect is causing global warming, we should see certain patterns in the warming. For example, the planet should warm faster at night than during the day. This is indeed being observed (Braganza 2004 (sjsu.edu), Alexander 2006 (knmi.nl)). [Blog explanation: Human Fingerprint on Climate Change: Nights warming faster than days (skepticalscience.com)] and the Stratosphere is Cooling Since the Heat Is Being Trapped in the Troposphere. . Another distinctive pattern of greenhouse warming is cooling in the upper atmosphere, otherwise known as the stratosphere. . This is exactly what's happening (Jones 2003 (agu.org)). . The Tropopause is Rising. With the lower atmosphere (the troposphere) warming and the upper atmosphere (the stratosphere) cooling, another consequence is the boundary between the troposphere and stratosphere, otherwise known as the tropopause, should rise as a consequence of greenhouse warming. . This has been observed (Santer 2003 (nyu.edu)). . The Ionosphere is Contracting. An even higher layer of the atmosphere, the ionosphere, is expected to cool and contract in response to greenhouse warming. This has been observed by satellites (Laštovi?ka 2006 (cas.cz)). . In addition to the 10 indicators proposed by Skeptical Science, there are many other empirically demonstrated lines of evidence for the rapid warming the earth is undergoing that should also be considered. . Here are two such items. . 11) Species are headed to the poles and/or higher elevations. According to published research in the journal Science from August 2011, species are heading toward the poles and/or higher elevations. (Source: Rapid Range Shifts of Species Associated with High Levels of Climate Warming) (The Lowly Pine Beetle, confined by COLD Temps. for millennia, to FAR Southern Latitudes … is now found routinely north of Fairbanks Alaska and across near Artic Canada. . Canadian Forestry Officials complain that this beetle NOW fells more Lodgepole Pines than Logging & Forest Fires Combined.) . 12) Plants are blooming far earlier each year. NASA research supports this (Source: Decades of Data Show Spring Advancing Faster Than Experiments Suggest) as well as a 2011 University of California-San Diego study of Arctic blooms of photoplankton (Source: Researchers discover arctic blooms occurring earlier) Finally, I leave you two excellent data points to consider: Wide Spread Scientific Agreement. (1) Scientific Consensus. No scientific organization of national or international standing opposes the Widespread SHARED UNDERSTANDING (consensus} regarding human-induced GLOBAL WARMING & its effects on climate change. . For those who may allege conspiracy, consider the sheer number and diversity of the organizations listed here, representing diverse scientific backgrounds from Western and non-Western nations alike. . (Besides, if this were a conspiracy, how did they get plants and animals to collude? For That Matter, how did they get Muslims and Jews and Christians to agree) (2) Independent Analyses and Converted Skeptics: In 2012, a Berkeley physicist completed an independent research project, funded in part by fossil fuel billionaires (the Koch brothers), to evaluate raw global temperature data and come to its own conclusions.

AND if man effects temps even slightly, climate will change too. AGAIN, by how much?? the data shows , NOT MUCH. almost insignificant. storms are no more intense, nor are the frequency of floods , droughts, land hitting hurricanes, sea level rise, etc etc. do some research. im using the IPCC, NOAA, and NASA data, so you cant shoot the messenger here!!! go watch a presentation of someone like Judith curry whom is an expert in the field. she doesn't think CAGW is real.... she was on that "scientific 97% study", but you are still failing to realize, and understand what the survey said and asked, and what the 97% agree upon...…. you need to read up a bit. have you read peer reviewed papers on the subject that discussed clouds, PDOs, solar events and cycles and their influence on water vapor and clouds... if you have, you might see there is still a LOT to learn. Its kind of funny... they all agree, (the 97%) but the models forecast near 10x the warming that we have seen..... and yet everyone is an "expert". comical really, and people like you with this Liberal flare for propagating hysteria and exaggeration, along with "consensus" is NOT doing anyone any good. science is NOT consensus.

I read about 1 peer reviewed paper on the topic a week and have done so for over 3 years now. I also have read books on the topic. (on both sides) and I would suspect you have read NONE! am I right? probably...………. no, there is NOT a "strong common agreement" that CACC is likely. where is your data? the vast majority of climate scientists DO not agree with the "consensus" argument. again, just look at this simply from the stand point of the data alone. from 1900 to 1940temps rose at a rate EQUAL to what we have seen in the past 30 years, but without C02 added by man by any significant levels. yet, from 1940 to 1970, temps fell.. while C02 skyrocketed? what caused the warming? could it be the cause now? could it be the cause in the medieval warming or roman warming? it points to a lack of sensitivity of our climate, certainly over 50 to 100 year periods. please look to PDOs, clouds, sun activity , water vapor, for which all have better correlations throughout history with global temps. YOU provide NO evidence or data for your position, even weakened by your statement of interviewing NON scientific PhD scientists who have NO knowledge of the topic, voicing their opinion from your "church". look, you are treating this as religion, and it is not. it is one of the most complicated sciences out there. a coupled non linear chaotic system. if you don't do research in it, you probably don't KNOW anything about it. I give you top scientists, and you discount them because they say what you don't BELIEVE. its not religion, its science. now, bring your science and we can discuss. do you know the difference between surface temp data and satellite data?? lets start there.

UgxZmFb2ovZYsiYqiBd4AaABAg.8rRhTZJH0HQ8sk_AATn8Jf		2	2019-03-21 19:35:40	Rick Kooi	@zanick2 So you keep on talking and never bothered to look at any of the ACTUALLY STUDIES of Scientific Thought....just keep repeated nice little stories....made up by the FICTION WRITERS at Daily Caller, New American and Breitfart..... There is really a COMMON OVERWHELMING AGREEMENT or consensus on global warming in the Scientific Community, actively Working on / Studying this phenomenon / or who had been working in these fields from EVERY NATION ON EARTH ? --------------- -------------- ( ( ( I attend an evangelical church in Milwaukee, and 8 scientists in non-climatology fields, have NEVER spoken to any Scientist in ANY field that denys largely Human causation of Global Warming & the threatening climate changes it is causing. ) ) ) ---------------- -------------- Michael Barnard, Low-carbon Innovation Strategist Updated Apr 26, 2017 . "Depending on the method, the many studies on this subject show that from 97.1% to 99.99% of climate scientists -- defined as researchers publishing in peer-reviewed journals -- accept that the climate is rapidly changing due to human actions. . The degree of severity they ascribe to impacts of climate change varies according to their specific areas of study and their models, but those ranges are captured in the IPCC 5 scenarios, all of which show not only warming but significant negative impacts. . The high end and very recent study shows 99.99% widespread agreement/consensus. . James L. Powell, director of the National Physical Sciences Consortium, did the most recent of Many peer-reviewed, published studies showing the overwhelming consensus by climate scientists on anthropogenic climate change. . Here's what he says: If the consensus were 97%, then to find 3 peer-reviewed articles that reject AGW, one would need to read, on average, 100 articles. Instead, to find even a single rejecting article, one must read nearly 5,000 articles. The true consensus on AGW cannot be as low as 97%. [...] The only sound and practical way to judge the extent of a scientific consensus is to search for articles that reject the prevailing theory. For 2013 and 2014, I found that only 5 of 24,210 articles and JUST 4 of 69,406 researcher/authors rejected anthropogenic global warming. . His full paper is linked from that site. Also very recently, Benestad et al published a paper in the journal Theoretical Applied Climatology in July 2015. They spread an even wider net than Powell, looking at every significant paper ever published in a peer-reviewed journal that denied anthropogenic climate change. . * They found 38 papers. * . A common denominator seems to be missing contextual information or ignoring information that does not fit the conclusions, be it other relevant work or related geophysical data. In many cases, short-comings are due to insufficient model evaluation, leading to results that are not universally valid but rather are an artifact of a particular experimental setup. Other typical weaknesses include false dichotomies, inappropriate statistical methods, or basing conclusions on misconceived or incomplete physics. [...] We also note that several of these papers involved the same authors and that the different cases were not independent even if they involved different shortcomings. Some of the cases also implied interpretations that were incompatible with some of the other cases, such as pronounced externally induced geophysical cycles and a dominant role of long-term persistence (LTP); slow stochastic fluctuations associated with LTP make the detection of meaningful cycles from solar forcing difficult if they shape the dominant character in the geophysical record. . Page on springer.com It other words, the papers don't agree with one another, they are written in fairly obvious ignorance of reasonably well known science and modelling basics and there are a handful of authors who keep writing stuff that's in denial, not a large number of them. The authors of this paper -- disclosure: I've communicated with Lewandowsky, one of the authors, many times -- bend over backward to avoid saying the obvious about the authors, instead treating them with respect and suggesting reasons why they might, possibly, maybe have just been accidentally ignorant. . But what about that 97%? . Multiple studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals show that 97 percent or more of actively publishing climate scientists agree: Climate-warming trends over the past century are very likely due to human activities. . In addition, nearly ALL of the leading scientific organizations worldwide have issued public statements endorsing this position. . Scientific Overwhelming Agreement / consensus: Earth's climate is warming . Here are the five major papers that arrived at 97%: J. Cook, et al, "Quantifying the consensus on anthropogenic global warming in the scientific literature," Environmental Research Letters Vol. 8 No. 2, (June 2013); DOI:10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024024 Quotation from page 3: "Among abstracts that expressed a position on AGW [Anthropogenic, or human-cause, Global Warming], 97.1% endorsed the scientific consensus. Among scientists who expressed a position on AGW in their abstract, 98.4% endorsed the consensus.” W. R. L. Anderegg, “Expert Credibility in Climate Change,” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Vol. 107 No. 27, 12107-12109 (21 June 2010); DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1003187107. P. T. Doran & M. K. Zimmerman, "Examining the Scientific Consensus on Climate Change," Eos Transactions American Geophysical Union Vol. 90 Issue 3 (2009), 22; DOI: 10.1029/2009EO030002. N. Oreskes, “Beyond the Ivory Tower: The Scientific Consensus on Climate Change,” Science Vol. 306 no. 5702, p. 1686 (3 December 2004); DOI: 10.1126/science.1103618. . So we have seven peer-reviewed and published papers which use different techniques, published from 2004 to 2015, which show that the consensus among climate science papers is in excess of 97% and that there are a tiny number of dissenters who are making obviously incorrect statements. 1. You can argue with one paper which has not been reproduced. 2. It's harder to argue with a paper whose results have been reproduced. 3. And it's much harder to argue with multiple different methodologies which arrive at the same result. 4. In the case of climate scientists having a very STRONG COMMON AGREEMENT or a consensus on the basics of anthropogenic climate change, consilience is extremely high.

Yes there has been slight warming since the 1970s but nothing indicates a strong correlation to mans input to C02 levels. yes, man is contributing, but it is a rounding error at best. do some research instead of the talking points and it will become clear. IPCC models predict 2-3 degrees for doubling of C02 (bench mark) yet we are 80% of the way there at 400ppm and temps are only up .8 degrees. we have seen cooling since 2016 btw. even during the skyrocketing phase of C02 levels in the last year, temps didn't move. this also points to a lack of sensitivity of the climate. clouds and their negative feedback might be the new area of research ,which is left out of the current models. lets leave the conspiracy theory out... if we talk about that, then the NOAA adjustments to data of the temps need to be looked at... and you don't want to go there! ;)	UC7loZpcuLltT0KI8W_b4kjw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7loZpcuLltT0KI8W_b4kjw	1	UgxZmFb2ovZYsiYqiBd4AaABAg	Anders Welander

After ALL of those Press Releases from Oil & Coal P.R. departments in the 1970's proclaiming a mini ice age was around the corner ! ...and then again in the '80s, twice in the '90s . The UAH’s Dr. Roy Spencer & Dr. John Christy ----BOTH having predicted that Global Warming would End around 2000, and then again...it would end with the solar minimum of 2007-2009 and then again...it would end around 2015 HOWEVER — THEY reported/admitted just a few months ago, that UAH data NOW confirms an “ UPWARD Global climate temperature trend SINCE Nov.16, 1978 -------->40 years ago ! [of] +0.14+ C / decade [1/4F]/decade.”------- * * * THAT amounts to a rate of 1.4C / 100 years. NOTE, temps. HAD risen 1.15C over the last century. SO THIS NEW CHRISTY RATE 1.4C / 100 years is a 20%+ increase in the rate of warming! . Compare that to Geological History of Temperature Changes: a life threateningly rapid increase in historic temps averaged 1C in 7500 years which Led to large specie Die-Offs. 1.4 C by humans per 100 yrs 1.0 C historical norm 7500 yrs HUMANS are raising temperatures around the world 50-75 times FASTER than Plants & Animals are able to adapt to. * * * * * * Spencer & Christy . .ADMITTING for the FIRST TIME: 1. NO PAUSE in Global Warming ! ..... NONE ! 2. NO HIATUS in Global Warming! ..... NONE ! 3. Sure as hell, > NO COOLING ! ......NONE ! . Dr. SPENCER: “my UAH cohort & boss John Christy, who does the detailed matching between satellites, is pretty convinced that the RSS data is undergoing SPURIOUS COOLING because RSS is still using the old NOAA-15 satellite which has a decaying orbit..." . While every one else correct the errors in sat. data thru mathematics but they had accused others of manipulating data sooo... . Spencer & Christ found it ideologically convenient to allow the satellite decay inaccuracies to support their previous predictions FOR YEARS ! !

NONE! NOT ONE ! . 1. CO2 has beneficially enabled life on Earth. (holding infra-red heat/warming the planet so life may proliferate)(has some fertilizer effect) (without CO2 + other Green House gases, Earth would be a Cold ROCK 0 degrees F.) . This is the story of a little is good & a lot is deadly...Aspirin, for example. . The Goldi Locks Level for humans of atmospheric CO2 has always been between 180ppm & 290ppm! . For every Year a human has walked on Earth (hundreds of thousands of years) CO2 & other Gasses have ALWAYS been between 180ppm and 290ppm. . Our Entire Physiology is BUILT UPON THOSE NUMBERS 180ppm and 290ppm. . Today, we have increased those gas levels to 412ppm & We have NO idea what the long term effects will be on our grand children. 2. CO2 has boosted plant life on Earth BUT Coincidentally, as CO2 levels have increased, Nutrient values have FALLEN at a Faster Rate ! . LESS iron LESS protein LESS Zinc Less Copper etc. .

If we use 1980 as the baseline year, why haven&#39;t the oceans risen substantially since then? I have a place on the east coast, right on the ocean since 1982, and I&#39;ve not detected a rise in the sea level. Maybe the oceans have risen elsewhere, but not where I live.

Then the heat (in the form of infrared light) must first pass through the atmosphere heat the Earth what is not removed by the heating of the Earth is reflected back into space.<br /><br /><br />The “Green house gases” reflect back to the earth to add heat is what they (Global warming people) are claiming.<br /><br /><br />The question I have is why dose no one want to account for “Green House Gases” not reflect some of the infrared into space before it reaches the Earth?<br /><br /><br />All things being equal the infrared coming from the Sun should be more than the infrared reflected away from the Earth then reflected back. Should this not cause the Earth to cool from the lack of infrared reaching the surface of the Earth with the increase of “Green House Gases”.<br /><br /><br />The other thing they ignore is that the Earth’s orbit in not a perfect circle. The orbit increases &amp; decreases over time which I have read in the “Climate and atmospheric history of the past 420,000 years from the Vostok ice core, Antarctica”. In which they explain the climate change by “much of the variability occurs with periodicities corresponding to that of the precession, obliquity and eccentricity of the Earth’s orbit”<br /><br /><br />My two cents	UCvFlbayHc2LxrVuFfRM9ZdQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvFlbayHc2LxrVuFfRM9ZdQ	0

Politicians believe in motivating people through fear yet the ones who need to fear are not Americans but the Chinese who put out way more carbon emissions than we do. We can try to lead by example, but in the end our atmosphere will still degrade if the rest of the world isn’t with us. The answer is always less. Use less gas, drive less, use less electricity, fart less, eat less beef, and throw less stuff into the regular garbage can. But I don’t need to be told to do these things I can do them on my own without government, or anyone else, telling me to do them.

Because if it isn&#39;t, we can&#39;t do anything about it and the world may become uninhabitable.<br />It is rather hubris that man thinks he has such control over his planet. However, it may just be possible that we could be tipping the scale meaning we could be advancing the change. If that&#39;s the case then we are far, far too late. It&#39;s also rather hurbris to think that we can &quot;change it back&quot;<br />Now I do believe that we could pollute the planet and make it uninhabitable. Nuclear energy it&#39;s one of the most awful things we have ever done. Generations from now will be paying the price of Fukushima.

Edit: also look at the fusion reactors being researched in europe and at MIT, uses far less radioactive material and far less prone to disaster.

Most people agree the climate is changing. The tricky part is how much is human activity contributing to it, and how much we really can do to curtail it. The goal should be to better stewards of the environment and cut down on pollution, but not in the drastic ways the alarmist want. Climate change alarmist just want to redistribute wealth.

And I'm already aware that there exists studies that are funded by special interests, but they are typically those directly or indirectly in affiliation with the Fossil Fuel Industry. Those who stand to lose billions in the wake of a mass energy transformation. If studies published from scientific institutions around the world predominately support AGW, this is a pretty good indication as to what interests are tampering with the evidence. And no nonsense theories of new world order agendas discredits this obvious consensus.

THAT'S WRONG btw. Because if that were your argument, we should have been cooling for at least the past couple decades, at least. The common consensus is, WE ARE WARMING. So if you at all doubted that fact, once you get up to speed on some of the fundamentals, we could then talk about the next OPINION or excuse as to why you may still not think the atmosphere has any impact on global temperatures. It IS well established science that c02 traps heat that is emitted from the Earth as infrared electromagnetic energy. Nobody can dispute this. It's literally in every highschool, college, and quite possibly even middle school text books due to the fact that there's simply no argument and everyone agrees, Once you do agree however, then you can imagine just how much c02 we've pumped into the atmosphere since the industrial revolution that could, just maybe, have an impact on the climate! A f**k TON it turns out! Yes, other forces have existed in the past, but c02 emissions in response have always amplified the warming as a feedback loop. But today, we are bypassing the first phase and going STRAIGHT to the second, emitting massive amounts of c02 as a result of various human activities that must of inherently been known to possibly not be great for our environment, climate, the PLANET. The only argument I've yet to really hear that attempts to disregard the obvious is that models are wrong... "Here's why they say," with virtually no evidence to back it up. Yet their argument is much more attractive only due to its simplicity, definitely it's bias due to what we obviously just WANT to do, and because it's easier to doubt something, rather than prove something that's hard to translate to the public, and especially when it's more difficult to understand as science often is. There are honestly so many points to make on this subject that can go on forever, but this is truly the fundamentals that are still equally important and shouldn't be dismissed so readily.

For one, I don&#39;t think that the debate should be if climate change is dangerous. Even if it doesn&#39;t kill us, do we want a world without polar ice caps, polar bears and penguins, orcas, with more mosquitos, bark beetles that don&#39;t die off each winter, so we have more dead trees and more wildfires? We have 8 billion people on the planet but less than 4000 tigers in the wild. How F&#39;d up is that? Stossel makes it sound as though the science of climate change is focused on the last few hundred years, by saying &quot;it&#39;s gone up and down the last few hundred years and it will continue to do so. But&#39;s that&#39;s just not true. By sampling ices cores hundreds of feet below the surface of the arctic ice, we know how much carbon dioxide was in the atmosphere throughout history, by studying fossil records and tree rings, we know a lot about weather patterns. This is a much more long range issue than a few degrees in a hundred years.<br /><br />The interview with Pat Michaels was interesting. I looked up the &quot;Cato Institute&quot; and found that it changed it&#39;s name from the Charles Koch Foundation, two years after it was formed. Koch Industries owns 4000 miles of petroleum pipeline, refines 80,000 barrels of oil per day, explores for gasoline, does ranching etc. So this spokesman from a think tank funded by a petroleum company is supposedly more credible than the scientists that say global warming is real? You&#39;re saying he has no vested interest in calling it a hoax? Really?<br /><br />Think tanks like the Cato Institute and the Heritage Foundation purport to be all about common sense, but their goal is to obscure science. Yes, government programs have to fight for funding, but they are trying to help their constituents, unlike groups funded by big business whose main objective is to make sure the rights of businesses trump everyone else rights.

UgxF25rtZKflGlsz-tJ4AaABAg	7	4	2019-02-13 23:32:03	Joe	This video claims that man made climate change is real. They do not call it global warming now. Every time they had a global warming convention it was -40 deg. so they had to change the name. It tries to inject some common sense into the global warming hysterical propaganda, but only succeeds in creating a distraction. There is .04% CO2 in the atmosphere. Man made CO2 is .04% of that total .04%. So I think that is .0016% ? If someone can check my math I would appreciate it. That is not enough to make any difference. The &quot;scientists&quot; (read government propagandists) told us in the 1970s that we were headed for another ice age. They also had many expensive and very stupid solutions that were proposed to save us from the climate, when we really need to be saved from the government solutions.

Look: https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-whats-warming-the-world/ . These are not ideas which have been invented by Al Gore or Modern Science. . 1799 Alexander von Humboldt studied, worried and postulated that Human Activites / pollution would CAUSE CLIMATE CHANGE! Strip Mining entire mountain tops, Clear Cutting entire Forests, burning Coal/Peat/Wood/Oil, building huge cities which have their own climates . The First USE of " CLIMATE CHANGE " STILL in use today. . 1799 Thomas Jefferson also penned a paper on observed climate changes which he stated was probably caused by man. . "1804 : Thomas Jefferson On Climate Change | Real Science . “A change in our climate is taking place very surely. Both heat and cold are becoming moderate within the memory of even the middle-aged, and snows are less frequent and less deep.” – Thomas Jefferson 1804" 1811 Science Tied Warming, Climate Changes directly to Human Activities & Industrialization. . 1856 "....a paper entitled “Circumstances affecting the heat of the sun’s rays,” by Eunice Foote. In two brisk pages, Foote’s paper anticipated the revolution in climate science by experimentally demonstrating the effects of the sunlight on certain gases and theorizing how those gases would interact with Earth’s atmosphere for the first time. In a column of the September 1856 issue of Scientific American titled “Scientific Ladies,” Foote is praised for supporting her opinions with “practical experiments.” The writers noted: “this we are happy to say has been done by a lady.” . Foote’s research & paper demonstrated the interactions of the sun’s rays on different gases through a SERIES of experiments...." ((Variations of those fundamental Experiments are critiqued/taught in nearly every 1st year science course on colleges and Universities around the world. . Svante Arrhenius (1859-1927) was a Swedish scientist that was the first to claim in 1896 that fossil fuel combustion may eventually result in enhanced global warming. . Broecker is probably best-known for popularizing the term “global warming” through his 1975 paper “Climatic Change: Are We on the Brink of a Pronounced Global Warming?” Read more: https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/lady-scientist-helped-revolutionize-climate-science-didnt-get-credit-180961291/#KKvj73exVZHRQm7u.99 .

Why don't you ban water? That would make more sense. CO2 is necessary for plant life. .04% is a very low number. We should probably have more.

If you don&#39;t learn from the past then you are doomed to repeat it but in this case if you don&#39;t learn from the past you are doomed to be ignorant of the earth warming and cooling cycles and cause panic about something natural that you can&#39;t control.

SINCE that PEAK in Temperatures, world temperatures have been slowly falling. (( each succeeding brief leveling off/and slight warming like the Medieval Warming, the Minoan Warming, is followed by a deeper cooling )) as we slid Towards Earth's most powerful cyclical Event: Glaciation! . (commonly referred to as an ICE AGE) . The CAUSES of Glaciations (Malinkovitch Cycles) CONTINUE to this very day, & are Extensively Studied & Well Understood. . (There is really no debate on this subject) . (Earth's Elliptical Orbit IS pulling us away from the Sun... less heat) (Earth's Axial Tilt away from the sun!.......less heat) (Earth's Wobble is conducive to glaciation) (THOSE Cyclical Events are the TRIGGERS of Earth's MOST POWERFUL NATURAL CYCLES of CHANGE...GLACIATIONS) . (THOSE CYCLES contine to this year...yet we are Warming NOT Cooling) . Hell, MUCH of the last 1000 years is Called the Little Ice Age, compounded by the Maunder Minimum in 1450-1540. . "ICE AGE" because of the FALLING temperatures for 8000 years. "LITTLE" because it ended. It ENDED ABRUPTLY in the late 1700's. Look for yourself: http://www.realclimate.org/images//Marcott.png . WHAT INTERUPTED EARTH'S most powerful natural cycle? Since then, temperatures have been rising for OVER 2 CENTURIES! (Thomas Jefferson and John Adams discussed this notable change.) Equally important is the FACT that Our Sun's " Energy Output " has DECREASED a bit over the last 50 years...all the while these temperatures have been rising. . Look for yourself: . Solar Energy Decreases, YET Global Warming Increases, more rapidly. https://static.skepticalscience.com/pics/TvsTSI.png .. THE EARTH SHOULD BE ' COOLING ' and ' COOLING ' DRAMATICALLY ! SO, What Terminated Earth's MOST powerful NATURAL CLIMATE CHANGE Cycle ? What Terminated the Little Ice Age ? . Only the Enhanced Green House Effect fully Explains this ongoing event! Look: https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-whats-warming-the-world/ . These are not ideas which have been invented by Al Gore or Modern Science. . 1799 Alexander von Humboldt studied, worried and postulated that Human Activites / pollution would CAUSE CLIMATE CHANGE! Strip Mining entire mountain tops, Clear Cutting entire Forests, burning Coal/Peat/Wood/Oil, building huge cities which have their own climates . The First USE of " CLIMATE CHANGE " STILL in use today. .	UCt9UyYrv76HIRb_2mKix47g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt9UyYrv76HIRb_2mKix47g	1	UgwOhjAfR4YNJTK7VTB4AaABAg	Da Trevmeister

You are talking about Global Warming (after 200 yrs. of research supporting it) as filtered thru & described by a FAILED POLITICIAN and NON SCIENTIST AL GORE. . What a WASTE of Spit and and Finger tips. . Greenhouse gases affect Earth’s energy balance and climate. The Sun serves as the primary energy source for Earth’s climate. Some of the incoming sunlight is reflected directly back into space, especially by bright surfaces such as ice and clouds, and the rest is absorbed by the surface and the atmosphere. . Much of this absorbed solar energy is re-emitted as heat (longwave or infrared radiation). The atmosphere in turn absorbs and re-radiates heat, some of which escapes to space. Any disturbance to this balance of incoming and outgoing energy will affect the climate. For example, small changes in the output of energy from the Sun will affect this balance directly. . If all heat energy emitted from the surface passed through the atmosphere directly into space, Earth’s average surface temperature would be tens of degrees colder than today. . Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, including: water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, (interfere with escaping Thermal IR Radiation) & act to make the surface much warmer than this, because they absorb and emit heat energy in all directions (including downwards), keeping Earth’s surface and lower atmosphere warm. . Without this greenhouse effect, life as we know it could never have evolved on our planet. Adding more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere makes it even more effective at preventing heat from escaping into space. . When the energy leaving Earth is less than the energy entering, Earth warms until a new balance is established. Greenhouse gases emitted by human activities ALTER Earth’s energy balance and thus its climate. . Humans also affect climate by changing the nature of the land surfaces (for example by clearing forests for farming/fuel/lumber) (Mining off mountain tops) and through the emission of pollutants that affect the amount and type of particles in the atmosphere. (Google ACID RAIN & then Google OZONE Depletion) Scientists have determined that, when all human and natural factors are considered, Earth’s climate balance has been altered towards warming, with the biggest contributor being increases in CO2.

((NOT the scientific community)) . ((( with the help of PHILLIPS OIL & EXXON Oil Co. money & thousands upon thousands of Press Releases promoting the obscure assertion of a new ice age / sudden cooling ))) . plus 1 book (though roundly critiqued by Mainstream Science) ((( Have you been READING lately...they are doing it again....There's a MINI ICE AGE COMING ! Of course it may be the same MINI ICE AGE promised in 2007-2009, and that may have been the mini ice age they Threatened us with in the 1990's. Keep in Mind, WHO SELLS HEAT ? ------------> Coal and Oil ? Oil & Coal Company PR departments were high-fiving by the end of the 70's! ((millions of dollars in support of a new ice age...1 million new OIL furnaces sold ))) . In the 1970's & then in the 80's, again in the late 90's then again in the early 2000's THOUSANDS of press releases promoting the idea about a new ICE AGE &/or a NEW WORLD COOLING, from the Fathers-of- Disinformation the COAL and OIL Monopolies Billionaires. . by the end of the 70's, Public Relations Departments OIL & Coal Energy Monopolies were high fiving one another since they had peddled a million new OIL FURNACES and had successfully diverted politicians from dealing with the scathing Research and Warning Reports given to the presidents . Pres. EISENHOWER in 1958 & an even more serious Warning to Pres. JOHNSON IN 1965 about the DANGERS of CO2 Caused GLOBAL WARMING & its changes to the climate of the entire world. EVEN NATURE'S Warnings inflicted on the world in the form of ACID RAIN and OZONE Depletion ((proven to be caused by Human/Industry dumping of Chemicals into the atmosphere)) have been ignored or ridiculed by the USUAL SUSPECTS. (pro fossil fuels disinformation propaganists) *** and then We have the newer nearly identical PREDICTIONS of a NEW ICE AGE in the 1990's THROUGH LAST YEAR, by FAMED DENIERS of GLOBAL WARMING Dr. Roy Spencer and Dr. John Christy . "Global Warming will cease to exist around 2000" as the Earth returns to its cyclical fall in temps.into the next glaciation (ice age) . How's that working out for them?? Well, 1st THEY came with thousands of press releases about a GLOBAL WARMING PAUSE. Kinda like filling in the blanks while waiting for the ice age to start ? . 2nd THEN THEY came with thousands of press releases about a GLOBAL WARMING HIATUS. Kinda like filling in the blanks with NOTHING but a Name Change. . 3rd AND THEN THEY came with thousands of press releases about a GLOBAL COOLING. ... Then they pronounce a SOLAR MINIMUM was about to hit in 2007-2009... Look out snow in summer ! ....except, of course, temperatures continued rising! ... Roughly every two years, we’re treated to headlines repeating that 70's myth ! Earth is headed for an imminent “mini ice age.” It happened in 2013, 2015, and again just recently at the tail end of 2017. Now we are hearing about a NEW GRAND SOLAR MINIMUM. TALK ABOUT SCARE TACTICS . and now these 2 SKEPTICS SHOW UP EATING CROW ! . FROM THOSE LEADING CLIMATE CHANGE DENIERS. . " A STUNNING ADMISSION: . "The UAH’s Dr. Roy Spencer & Dr. John Christy? —both leading deniers? ---Both having predicted that Global Warming would End around 2000 as the Earth would return to its falling temps. as we enter the next Glaciation. —reported just last month that the UAH data shows a “Global climate trend since Nov. 16, 1978 [of] +0.14+C [0.22+F] per decade.” . THAT is 1.4C per century...FAR HIGHER THAN ANY STATISTICAL NORM. In Geologic History, a truly rapid rise in temps was 1C in 7500 years versus human caused temperature rise of over 1.4C/ 100 years. . Temperatures have been increasing all along ! 1. NO Global Warming PAUSE ! NONE ! 2. NO Global WarmingHIATUS ! NONE ! 3. sure as hell, > > NO COOLING ! NONE ! . Dr. SPENCER: “my UAH cohort & boss John Christy, who does the detailed matching between satellites, is pretty convinced that the RSS data is undergoing " SPURIOUS COOLING " because RSS is still using the old NOAA-15 satellite which has a decaying orbit..." .. Spencer & Christ found it " ideologically convenient " to allow the decay inaccuracies to support their previous fallacious predictions. . So 2014 was the hottest temperatures ever recorded until 2015 was the hottest temperatures ever recorded until 2016 was the hottest temperatures ever recorded and 2017 was the hottest 2nd to 2016 ! 2018 just snuggled in between these... WE HAVE THE HOTTEST 5 YEARS in thousands of years! ********************************** A Maddening Corrupting Influence of Commerce & Capitalism and ANTI SCIENCE!

With the knowledge that Human Industry/Agriculture were PUMPING over 100 times MORE CO2 & Greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than all Earth's Volcanoes, combined, every year. The World's Leading Scientific Minds & specifcally nearly all of NASA LEADING SCIENTISTS, Challenged, Questioned & Critiqued the Effects of Greenhouse Gasses (specifically CO2/Water Vapor & their multiplier effect) on climate ! In 1970, NASA launched the IRIS/satellite that Observed & Measured Escaping Infra Red THERMAL Energy spectra between 400 cm-1 to 1600 cm-1. ( Google:--------------->IRIS-Satellite Research) In 1996, the Japanese Space Agency launched the IMG/satellite which recorded similar observations. (Google:--------------->IMG-Satellite Research) . Both sets of data were compared to discern any changes in escaping infra red thermal radiation over the 26 year period (Google---------------->Harries Research Study, 2001). . They found a Dramatic DROP in Escaping (earth cooling) Infra Red THERMAL Radiation at the Precise wavelength bands that greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) & methane (CH4) absorb energy ! While ESCAPING Infra Red THERMAL Radiation is DECREASING. ------------------------------> Green House Gases were INCREASING ! (hand in glove) The change in ESCAPING I.R. THERMAL radiation is consistent with theoretical expectations / Global Warming Science Predictions. . Research & Numerous Studies have found: "direct experimental empirical evidence for a significant increase in the Earth's greenhouse effect"/GLOBAL Warming. . This result has been confirmed by numerous subsequent research & Studies using more recent satellite data, Digital Balloon Launches,etc. . The 1970 & 1997 spectra were compared with additional satellite data from the ---------> NASA AIRS satellite launched in 2003 . ( Google---------------------->Griggs Research Study 2004). . This analysis was extended to 2006 using data from the ----->AURA satellite launched in 2004 . (Google:---------------------->Chen 2007 research Study) . Both Research papers found the observed differences in CO2 bands matching the expected changes from rising carbon dioxide levels. . * AGAIN------------------------>We have empirical evidence that increased CO2 is causing an enhanced greenhouse effect. . ** ALL, These research studies & papers  found -----------------------------------> "direct experimental evidence for a significant increase in the Earth's greenhouse effect" /Global Warming. .

When greenhouse gases absorb Earth Emissions of infrared THERMAL radiation, that energy heats the atmosphere which in turn re-radiates infrared THERMAL radiation in all directions. . Much of it makes its way back to the earth. Hence we would expect to find more infrared Thermal radiation heading downwards. . Surface measurements from 1973 to 2008 find an increasing trend of downward infrared heat radiation returning to earth. . Google this SOURCE:-------------------->(Wang Infra Red Heat 2009) . A regional study over the central Alps found that downward infrared THERMAL radiation is increasing due to the enhanced greenhouse effect. . Google this SOURCE:-------------------->(Philipona 2004) .

Our observation is less than 1% compared to the whole existence of the rock we lived in. Yet we make an assumption hey this happened 100 million years ago that happened 50 million years ago but nobody has a solid data during those times only speculation. Setting that aside say is real will the other countries agree to help out reducing global warming probably not. For example, I do not think China will contribute to protecting the planet.

As you can see in the charts above, wind and solar energy generation increased notably from the first half of 2017 to the first half of 2018. Together, generation from these two sources increased ... --------------------------------------------------------------- "Eighteen percent of all electricity in the United States was produced by renewable sources in 2017, including solar, wind, and hydroelectric dams. That’s up from 15% in 2016, with the shift driven by new solar and wind projects, the end of droughts in the West, and a dip in the share of natural gas generation. Meanwhile, both greenhouse gas emissions from power generation and consumer spending on power declined. Renewables’ share of U.S. energy consumption has now doubled since 2008, as coal’s share crashed in the same period from 48% to 30%. And while the Trump administration has signaled a desire to cut funding for renewable energy and efficiency programs, the trends seem set to continue thanks to market forces. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. Solar and wind projects made up roughly 62% of new power construction in 2017, as their cost continues to plummet. And 2.9 gigawatts of new renewable energy projects were initiated last year, while 12.5 gigawatts worth of coal plants are set to shut down in 2018 – also part of an accelerating trend. Thanks to that shift, the solar and wind industries are creating jobs faster than the rest of the economy. The findings come from the 2018 Sustainable Energy in America Factbook, produced each year by the Business Council for Sustainable Energy and Bloomberg New Energy Finance."

Does the earth have patterns that cool it meaning that the oceans might be absorbing some of the emissions so that it's preventing from all of this from happening? how much does it matter? how much is it due to just natural weather patterns?!?! just how much of climate change is due to human behavior? and even if u wanted to reverse it, what would it take ultimately? are u willing to go back to a time like 1850 when there were no fossil fuels almost?! https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexepstein/2015/01/06/97-of-climate-scientists-agree-is-100-wrong/#79397aea3f9f learn how solar energy cannot sustain itself without massive government subsidies unlike fossil fuels!! http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/energy-environment/302900-solar-energy-cant-survive-without-massive-subsidies	UCGG42NC89kh4QfweJH5KeaA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGG42NC89kh4QfweJH5KeaA	1	UgzDqgIobsD7jO_Dc_54AaABAg	Jennifer Osborne

Solar & Wind do not require trucking millions of tons of COAL to electric generation sites (with all the pollution blown off transport & spills that occur during transport. . 3. Solar & Wind do not require trucking millions of tons of TOXIC WASTE to thousands of open-air holding ponds and pits.

Global Warming Science & Climate Models have successfully predicted for over 60 YEARS See the AAAS & Presidential Advisory Councils Report & Warning on CLIMATE CHANGE and Global Warming . (( which add to the 1958 Warning of Global Warming presented to President Eisenhower)) , 1. That the globe would warm, . ((directly counter to the Mini ICE Age myth perpetuated by the Skeptic/Fossil Fuel Industrialists---a mini ice age in the '70s, again in the 80's, '90's, 2007-2009, 2015, 2016,2018. and now again 2020 we will be up to our assets in that mini ice age in 2020)) . and about how fast it would warm, and about how much it would warm. . http://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6242/1469 2. That the troposphere would warm and the stratosphere would cool. ((not one SKEPTIC has offered a scientific explanation for this GLOBAL WARMING SCIENCE PROOF)) . 3. That nighttime temperatures would increase more than daytime temperatures. ((After all of the SUB ZERO temps this year, Wisconsin meteorologists pooled their data and found nite time winter cold temps have WARMED 10 degrees of the last 40 years)) . 4. That winter temperatures would increase more than summer temperatures. 5. Polar amplification (greater temperature increase as you move toward the poles). 6. That the Arctic would warm faster than the Antarctic. 7. The magnitude (0.3 K) and duration (two years) of the cooling from the Mt. Pinatubo eruption. 8. They made a retrodiction for Last Glacial Maximum sea surface temperatures which was inconsistent with the paleo evidence, and better paleo evidence showed the models were right. 9. They predicted a trend significantly different and differently signed from UAH satellite temperatures, and then a bug was found in the satellite data. 10. The amount of water vapor feedback due to ENSO. 11. The response of southern ocean winds to the ozone hole. 12. The expansion of the Hadley cells. 13. The poleward movement of storm tracks. 14. The rising of the tropopause and the effective radiating altitude. 15. The clear sky super greenhouse effect from increased water vapor in the tropics. 16. The near constancy of relative humidity on global average. 17. That coastal upwelling of ocean water would increase. ---------------- Broecker is probably best-known for popularizing the term “global warming” through his 1975 paper “Climatic Change: Are We on the Brink of a Pronounced Global Warming?” & Spot On Accurate Projections of Threatening Climate Changes from Human Triggered Global Warming. ---------------- https://www.nrdc.org/stories/global-warming-101#warming https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Global_Temperature_Anomaly.svg https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/ ---------------------- The planet IS accumulating heat ! --------------------- March 2019 "Fossil fuel giants Shell and Exxon are far from perfect, but they are taking a stand against the Trump administration’s attempt to kill regulations on a potent greenhouse gas.

On the other side of the blue-green orb, in waters that today would surround Antarctica, sea-surface temperatures might have topped an unthinkable 86 degrees Fahrenheit, with near-tropical forests on Antarctica itself. There were perhaps even sprawling, febrile dead zones spanning the tropics, too hot even for animal or plant life of any sort. This is what you get in an ancient atmosphere with around 1,000 parts per million (ppm) of carbon dioxide. . If this number sounds familiar, 1,000 ppm of CO2 is around what humanity is on pace to reach by the end of this century. . That should be mildly concerning. ((More than Mildly Concerning)) “You put more CO2 in the atmosphere and you get more warming, that’s just super-simple physics that we figured out in the 19th century,” says David Naafs, an organic geochemist at the University of Bristol. “But exactly how much it will warm by the end of the century, we don’t know. Based on our research of these ancient climates, though, it’s probably more than we thought.” Last week, Naafs and colleagues released a study in Nature Geoscience that reconstructs temperatures on land during this ancient high-CO2 hothouse of the late Paleocene and early Eocene epochs—the sweltering launch to the age of mammals.

Corporate purchases of renewable energy have grown around the world, reaching 7.2 gigawatts in 2018 according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. https://cleantechnica.com/2018/12/14/renewables-are-the-cleanest-the-cheapest/ ** over view: https://cleantechnica.com/2018/12/24/yay-coal-in-my-stocking-critiques-of-climate-action-amidst-moves-to-renewable-energy/ ** "A new report revels 42% of global coal capacity is currently unprofitable, and the United States could > > save $78 billion by closing coal-fired power plants in line climate goals. This industry-disrupting trend comes down to dollars and cents, as the cost of renewable energy plumets below fossil fuel generation. Across the U.S., renewable energy is beating KILLER coal Electric on cost: The price to build new wind and solar has fallen below the cost of simply running existing coal-fired power plants in Red and Blue states. For example, Colorado’s Xcel will retire 660 megawatts (MW) of coal capacity ahead of schedule in favor of renewable sources and battery storage, and reduce costs in the process. Midwestern utility MidAmerican will be the first utility to reach 100% renewable energy by 2020 without increasing customer rates, and Indiana’s NIPSCO will replace 1.8 gigawatts (GW) of coal with wind and solar. . Lazard’s annual ... Cost of Energy (LCOE) analysis reports solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind costs have dropped an extraordinary 88% and 69% since 2009, respectively. Meanwhile, coal and nuclear costs have increased by 9% and 23%, respectively. Even without accounting for current MASSIVE FOSSIL FUEL subsidies, renewable energy costs can be considerably lower than the marginal cost of conventional energy technologies. In other words, customers save money when utilities replace existing coal with wind or solar ." * * * * * "....Nov 11, 2018 at 9:43AM	UCt9UyYrv76HIRb_2mKix47g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt9UyYrv76HIRb_2mKix47g	1	UgxEo4NeboXlyTW2JSl4AaABAg	Garrett Lees

The 2nd law of Thermodynamics dictates that the earth is cooling as it gets older to decay. The ice age in the past was the side effect of the catastrophic flood. Fossilized tropical plants are found hurried under the ice in the south poles, which suggest the earth is more greener in the past. Global warming is a hoax, a ploy, of the globalist movement to create excuse for and to gain control of the world.	UCU5J1cOgoWaaLEIplWGROXQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU5J1cOgoWaaLEIplWGROXQ	0

Without plant life we&#39;d all die, so we need that gas of life in our atmosphere and if that grows we see plant life boom and take in the carbon dioxide. A booming of plant life, such as plants humans use for food, is a good thing for life on earth, animal life and plant life. On the ice topic anyone can see that if you have a glass of water with ice cubes in it and you let the ice cube melt, the glass of water doesn&#39;t get deeper and overflow. Nope. That wouldn&#39;t happen with the ice caps melting either. Does human activity really cause global warming? Earth had global warming that melted the ice ages back when men sat in their caves with a tiny fire to keep them warm. The sun caused the climate change that melted the fields of ice during the ice ages. The sun is still a huge impact on climate, changing it without man&#39;s influence.

The warmer it gets the better the summer, the shorter the winter, and the less spending for heating. For my local perspective it is really great. What I miss is the 50 cm of snow and -20 Centigrade for a couple of weeks, as it used to be in my childhood. Greetings from south of Poland. But, when I think about what has happened on Venus with a runaway greenhouse effect, and the surface temperature high enough to melt lead, no I don&#39;t want to go there.

You&#39;ll notice that it links the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans, and that all the oceans are one huge body of water. <br />The frozen portion of the Arctic ocean is, therefore, already in the global body of water we call the oceans. If it melts, the sea levels will not rise, as that volume of water is already in the global ocean. <br />In fact, sea levels will fall, ever so slightly, because as water freezes, it expands. Ergo- the VOLUME of water in the world&#39;s oceans would be slightly LESS if the polar ice cap were to melt, leading sea levels to fall.

Environmental issues are especially popular. But how many are really involved ? Recycling does not<br />count. It is just another feel good thing they do to &quot;play the game.&quot; They &quot;use&quot; minorities in a vain attempt<br />to show how &quot;cruel&quot; conservatives are and how compassionate they are. They use the lgtbq community in the <br />same way. Conservatives are &quot;intolerant&quot; and they , by contrast are very tolerant!!! That is a good laugh!!!<br />The Master Piece Cake Shop owner received many death threats after he patiently and respectfully explained<br />to the gay couple that his faith prohibited him from baking a wedding cake for a gay couple. They use the<br />illegal immigrant situation the same way. Liberals are kind and welcoming and conservatives are cruel.<br />They do their very best not to betray that if a family if illegals moved into their neighborhood, they would be<br />less than happy about it...It is a virtue signaling way of life and it is hard to live a lie!!!!!

KEY TRUMP Foreign Policy Advisor, National Security Advisor, & Republican Campaigner General Michael Flynn’s confessed actions violated the LAWS of the United States & the State of Virginia. . As a high-ranking member of the U.S. military, with high security clearance, it was ILLEGAL for him to accept money from any FOREIGN POWER ! & He Was TOLD not to accept the money, because it would be foundout. ... FROM A SANCTIONED ENEMY STATE ! $200,000 from RUSSIAN 'business interests' / 'lobbyists'/ KGB/FSB $600,000 from TURKISH 'business interests' / tied-at-the-hip to RUSSIAN KBG/FSB. . 1. He was warned by the Pentagon that it would be " ILLEGAL " for him to do so. HE DID IT ANYWAY ! 2. He was continuing to accept foreign money even as he was part of a campaign for President. 3. He was APPOINTED National Security Adviser to the President of the Untied States while accepting foreign money, . (( which is a damn Powerful position)) and HE REFUSED to disclose his income from the hostile internationally SANCTIONED enemy Russian EMPIRE. . Manafort & Flynn FIRST ATTEMPTED to obey US Federal Law by registering as AGENTS for a foreign nation. .. in March, 2017 LONG AFTER BEING FIRED and Subpoenaed ...attempted to claim that status back dated several years...prior to the Trump campaign & during the Trump Campaign / Transition, into his presidency. . Hillary Clinton broke State Department rules. But 10 (TEN !) vigorous / vicious Congressional REPUBLICAN investigations . $100 Million + tax payer money. & 4 DOJ & FBI (Republican Led) investigations. . $75 MILLION more in taxpayer money. . all found insufficient EVIDENCE that she had broken any laws. . $175,000,000+ spent and NOT ONE INDICTMENT. Not one indictment on any charge in any state in the Union. * * General Michael Flynn broke many United States LAWS and Virginia State Laws. Congress had barely begun its first, very reluctant investigation, & had already come to that conclusion. General Flynn was breaking the law on the payroll of a SANCTIONED ENEMY STATE of the UNITED STATES of AMERICA as a Campaigner/advisor for TRUMP, as a foreign policy advisor for TRUMP, as National Security Advisor, a damned important position with an office right next to the president in the white house.. AT THE Innauguration, FLYNN was finalizing an agreement for a TRUMP HOTEL IN MOSCOW.... Remember TRUMPS CLAIMS he had no deals, no financial arrangmentes, no nothing with RUSSIA????? ** Hillary Clinton was careless, foolish, & arrogant, but she did not deliberately aid any foreign power! ** Michael Flynn Directly acted-on-behalf of a foreign nation, with a history of hostility toward the United States, & accepted a great deal of money in payment for that service. . It was definitively illegal, & comes very, very close to the definition of treason.

(Like Hegemony from IRAN/IRAQ, Yemen, Syria, some Afghanistan & Pakistan provinces.) 1. Trump has loudly criticized the NATO military alliance as unduly burdensome for the United States. HE Even Suggested that Defending NATO MEMBER (--paid Up--)Montenegro would hardly be worth World War III. . Sounds like Neville Chamberlain SELLING OUT Czechoslovakia...and announcing PEACE IN OUR TIME! TRUMP knew when he made that statement...that Bloody Putin had stationed the Newest Troops and TANKS along those Eastern European Borders! 2. He has started a trade war with many of those same allies. . (--Japan & the European Union formed the world's LARGEST Free Trade Zone, completely without the USA--) . ( Remember the Good Old Day when the US was leader of the world and Ally of the European Union & Japan) 3. And on his way to the G-7 summit of industrialized democracies Friday morning, he suggested that those nations re-admit Russia to the gathering ( ? ) even though BLOODY Russia continues to occupy part of Ukraine AND Occupies all of the Crimea, Occupies a chunk of Georgia, has never been punished for Genocide in Chechnya, the reason it was expelled from the group in the first place. . “If this were a screenplay, Hollywood would have thrown it out as too ridiculous,” said Tom Nichols, a Russia expert at the Naval War College. . “I can’t think of anybody who thinks this is a good idea.” . “ Today crystallizes precisely why Putin was so eager to see Trump elected ! ” said Ned Price, a former CIA analyst and the National Security Council spokesman. “For Putin, this is return on his investment, & it’s safe to say that his investment has paid off beyond even wildest dreams!” . HELL'S BELLS, A Russian ARMED and LED mercenary army HAS ATTACKED US TROOPS in Syria a few months ago. For 3 (three) days, our troops waited for Our Commander in Chief to authorize the right to self defense ! For 3 Days, our Commander in Chief failed to answer ! . OUR troops finally had to rely on OBAMA ERA standing orders, in order to defend themselves and counter attack. . ** Our President Trump SAID NOTHING about this RUSSIAN ATTACK ! *** Our President Trump DID NOTHING about this RUSSIAN ATTACK ! but he held SECRET meetings with PUTIN he invited Putin to Washington, DC he believed Putin's STRONG Denial that he MEDDLED with the US election he was invited BACK to Moscow He asked that Russia be readmitted to the G8, despite having attacked the US. . He kissed the ARS of the RUSSIAN BEAR by GRABBING DEFEAT FROM THE JAWS OF VICTORY and ordered US troops out of Syria. ****	UCt9UyYrv76HIRb_2mKix47g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt9UyYrv76HIRb_2mKix47g	1	Ugz6GqhhtfJT7WX657t4AaABAg	Richard Myhan

The Only Mathematically effective and sustainable solution is to reduce Human Population or stop the increase at the very least !!! But this is never said in the Media for some reason !! <br />When responsible smart European people started having less children the Media told them this is a Mistake ?!! Why ?!! What the hell is wrong when a country population goes from 80M to 50M over 20 years ?!! isn&#39;t this better for the planet and for the resources consumption ?!! <br />No we are told that this is bad and we need immigrants from 3rd world high birth rate countries !! Why ?! to have younger population to pay pension for the old !?!! But Where are all the money old people paid all their live in social security ?! Sorry the governments spent it. And how would importing 3rd world immigrants who mostly do not work and live on Gov welfare, how this will help ?! Do not ask or you will be called racist. <br /> <br />Earth Population rapid increase is a huge problem on the long run, but no one is scaring the shit out of people about it now !! Which makes me doubt that all of the scaring about other issues is selective to further a selective political Agenda.

Action was taken worldwide to drastically reduce Chlorofluorocarbon emissions and ozone layer depletion was halted and reversed (but not yet fully restored to pre-industrialized world levels). The ozone layer plays an important role in attenuating UV radiation from the sun (and space, in general). A sudden reduction in ozone protection would most likely have deleterious effect on the skin, and other organs, of exposed skin mammals who did not take other measures to protect themselves from solar exposure. In the (very) long term, if the ozone layer were completely obliterated, evolution would favor exposed skin mammals that could tolerate the additional exposure. In the meantime, a great many exposed skin mammals would likely have shorter life spans.	UCtvKdSd7cVuT5yrLCQ7IfTQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtvKdSd7cVuT5yrLCQ7IfTQ	0

You will NEVER be able to answer that question because we are INCAPABLE of destroying the planet. Therefore are INCAPABLE of so-called SAVING IT. Besides, who says the temperatures today is considered NORMAL. Because the temperatures hundreds of years ago were different. Thousands of years ago they were different. Hundreds of thousands of years ago they were different. Millions of years ago they were different.

Every change (specifically (not especially) in climate) will throw off the delicate balance of the world. Every change, will cause due to its direct fallout and butterfly effect massive changes, that even at a 25% profit aren&#39;t worth risking our Earth, not at least until we&#39;d terraform Mars or find a way to suck out the CO2 out of the atmosphere to the natural level.<br /><br />That being said, nature would also evolve to suit the new temperature, but evolution takes time, and by the time it&#39;s done it may be too late if the change is too drastic.

They are funded by governments through research grants so they have to keep generating new avenues to research. The trouble is their efforts are focussed on proving climate change is man made. That is not science. Real science is putting up an hypothesis and asking people to disprove it. In this industry they freeze out anyone who doesn&#39;t repeat the man made climate change mantra. Real scientists would weclome the challenge of people with opposing views. The fact they are not wiling to this demonstrates that they don&#39;t believe it themselves. If Governments want the truth they should allocate 50% of the climate research grants to projects designed to prove climate change is just a natural geological process. If the funding is all given to people hell bent on proving climate change is man made guess what their research will show...

"....He invented the mercury thermometer (first practical, accurate thermometer) and Fahrenheit scale (first standardized temperature scale to be widely used). The mercury-in-glass or mercury thermometer was invented by physicist Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit in Amsterdam (1714)...." . And by the way, the world has warmed more that 1 DEGREE C and the RATE of warming has increased since the 1970's ! . YOUR FAVORITE SATELLITE/Climate SCIENTISTS Skeptics / :Deniers Dr. Roy Spencer/ Dr. John Christy. . WHO popularized Sloganeering Anti-Global-Warming-by-Press-Release. AND INVENTED 1st ( the "GLOBAL WARMING PAUSE") 2nd ( the "GLOBAL WARMING HIATUS") 3rd ( the "GLOBAL Cooling") . REALLY? . FROM THOSE LEADING CLIMATE CHANGE SKEPTICS . After ALL of those Press Releases from Oil & Coal P.R. departments in the 1970's proclaiming a mini ice age was around the corner ! ...and then again in the '80s, twice in the '90s . The UAH’s Dr. Roy Spencer & Dr. John Christy ----BOTH having predicted that Global Warming would End around 2000, and then again...it would end with the solar minimum of 2007-2009 and then again...it would end around 2015 and NOW WE HAVE PREDICTIONS in the media of a GRAND SOLAR MINIMUM ushering in a mini ice age...what again? . HOWEVER — THEY reported/admitted just a few months ago, that UAH data NOW confirms an “ UPWARD Global climate temperature trend SINCE Nov.16, 1978 -------->40 years ago ! [of] +0.14+ C / decade [1/4F]/decade.”------- * * * THAT amounts to a rate of 1.4C / 100 years. NOTE, temps. HAD risen 0.85 to 1.15C over the last century. SO THIS NEW CHRISTY RATE 1.4C / 100 years is a 20%+ increase in the rate of warming! . Compare that to Geological History of Temperature Changes: a life threateningly rapid increase in historic temps averaged 1C in 7500 years which Led to large specie Die-Offs. 1.4 C by humans per 100 yrs 1.0 C historical norm 7500 yrs HUMANS are raising temperatures around the world 50-75 times FASTER than Plants & Animals are able to adapt to. * * * * * * Spencer & Christy . .ADMITTING for the FIRST TIME: 1. NO PAUSE in Global Warming ! ..... NONE ! 2. NO HIATUS in Global Warming! ..... NONE ! 3. Sure as hell, > NO COOLING ! ......NONE ! . Dr. SPENCER: “my UAH cohort & boss John Christy, who does the detailed matching between satellites, is pretty convinced that the RSS data is undergoing SPURIOUS COOLING because RSS is still using the old NOAA-15 satellite which has a decaying orbit..." . While every one else correct the errors in sat. data thru mathematics but they had accused others of manipulating data sooo... . Spencer & Christ found it ideologically convenient to allow the satellite decay inaccuracies to support their previous predictions FOR YEARS ! !

Yes, it is a scare tactic to get people to move on to clean and renewable energy. The science may be debatable to some (although I don&#39;t see how) but the logic is irrefutable. There is no reason to deny clean and renewable energy. It will safe money (Abundance vs finite) and if it reduces pollution at the same time... I am all for it as a consumer, wouldn&#39;t you?. Also, switching to renewables will extend the inventory of fossil fuel for future generation should they need it. So .. what wrong with that? Why do some people keep connecting this to the LEFT? It&#39;s got nothing to do with the left .. it&#39;s just simple logic as it makes perfect sense to start the change process. Obviously, the losers are the fossil fuel related industries ... and I can only suppose that they are the real people bitching about all this.

Pollution is bad and we are effecting our bio diversity. I don’t know why casual folk keep fighting for us to dig up the earth. Resources are limited. Why not work towards a renewable system. I lived in Shanghai for many years, garbage air from toxics coming from factories is real. Pollution can travel and stays in the air. Our oceans are filthy, why is that good? Corals are dying that’s a bad thing. Species are disappearing and Forrest are disappearing. Why are we still logging Forrest’s instead of just farming trees. Fly on a plane and you can see human destruction everywhere. How can that not be affecting people and the planet.

Space based ionispheric heaters aka ( star wars) and the geoengineering... ARE A SERIOUS ISSUE, and not under any congressional oversight. This is already causing fires and years of major drought in California, hiding Fukushima radiation. <br />Earth is not facing a warming trend now, but a maunder minumum ( mini ice age), like the one that caused the Vikings to explore &amp; fight in Europe for lands &amp; food. The same reason the Thames froze over. All this as an excuse to depopulate, and rewild massive lands, build mega cities, destroy immune systems against a healthy population using wireless like wifi, GWEN towers, and the 5-G. And a release of airborne plagues already spreading like the swine &amp; bird to kill millions. <br /><br />Those globalists destroy their own companies like Walmart to manipulate entire towns across the USA, steering populations into the online world for much better monitoring and manipulation. Meanwhile, they still call oil a fossil fuel, and use all manner of means to prevent advanced energy. Nikola Tesla, Raymond Rife, Wilhelm Reich, and a thousand others since.<br />Oh... the sky is falling... be very afraid. HEY MR. GLOBALIST... go jump in the ever colder &amp; colder lake.

Now, because of human interference, green house gases have increase at a rate the Earth can't compete with. Increasing co2 by humans causes a net positive in co2 levels as the climate changes. This causes unnatural interferences with global temperature that nature has no solution for. Stuff like droughts, dangerous weather like hurricanes, and rising sea levels would have gradually effected the earth without problem over long stretches of time. Now, species of all kinds from trees to fish and frogs can't adapt in time.	UCPDoPyO5ReuW99U2xM9NkOg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPDoPyO5ReuW99U2xM9NkOg	1	Ugx-hYJnv9r60byytYR4AaABAg	wade5941

Both pass thru the atmosphere and are absorbed by the surface of the Earth and converted to kinetic energy (heat). This heat is emitted back outward as thermal radiation aka IR. A significant amount of this IR is reabsorbed by the denser atmospheric gases such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, etcetera. This excites their molecular structure and the resulting kinetic energy re-emits IR. Life on Earth is made possible by the capturing of enough IR to keep the biosphere warm enough to sustain life. As the heavier molecules in the atmosphere increase, the amount of IR also increases.<br /><a href="https://samslair.blogspot.com/search?q=Greenhouse+Effect&amp;m=1">https://samslair.blogspot.com/search?q=Greenhouse+Effect&amp;m=1</a>	UCov_MpgR7_57q7rmQPaCWPA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCov_MpgR7_57q7rmQPaCWPA	0

Within recent years, the world has been observed to have more extreme highs and lows in temperature. The sea level has risen by 4 to 8 inches in the past century. House values in Miami, Florida have also been affected by the rise in sea level, a direct result of global warming and the climate change associated with it. Climate change does not care whether or not you believe in it; it will affect you regardless.	UCqCpABUOPNbdGzRVWrJMbhw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqCpABUOPNbdGzRVWrJMbhw	0

So it&#39;s not just that climate changes are happening, it&#39;s that it&#39;s happening in a way that&#39;s never happened before and those changes can be traced to human involvement. Furthermore, those unprecedented changes are and will continue to be a growing threat to society. Not saying that it&#39;s certain but let&#39;s get the argument correct.

No, I&#39;m not some far left leaning liberal ( in case you&#39;re interested); however, I do believe that living under doctrine that we are free to pollute, poach, convert every acre toward our comfort, is inherently dangerous and morally wrong.

Paul Ryan, August 2016, whined that the Energy Industries in the USA, excluding the new Solar and Wind Industries, by years end with Crack the $1 TRILLION mark for the first time in history. . Including Extensive Infra Structure Construction and then years of maintenance, Supports, Training Wages, Subsidies, Foreign Air programs that dollar-for-dollar reimburse other nations for the subsidies they pay our ever profitable Energy Industries etc. . Remember the Oil Industry Spokespeople on TV during the Trump Tax Debate (the one that promised a 30% Middle Class Tax cut?) . ....Those Oil Spokesman WHINED mightily about how they have the LARGEST TAX RATE OF ANY NATION ON EARTH !!!! 44% Remember? --------------------> What t. They never bothered to tell you is that NOT ONE COMPANY has ever gotten close to paying the rate! Not One ! Not EVER! . US NEWS & WORLD REPORT "....At Taxpayers for Common Sense, we recently analyzed the federal income taxes paid over the last five years by some of the largest U.S.-based oil and gas companies. What we found surprised us. We set out to document the federal tax rate of oil and gas industry leaders because we knew the claim made by the American Petroleum Institute – that the industry pays an income tax rate of 44.3 percent – is misleading. The claim is misleading because the institute uses it in the context of reforming the federal tax code, but the figure includes all foreign, state and local taxes, as well as federal. When we looked at the financial statements of 20 of the largest oil and gas companies, we found this group paid an average federal tax rate of 24 percent on its U.S. income. This was not surprising. It is no secret the federal tax code is riddled with broad exceptions and deductions allowing many industries to pay much less than the standard 35 percent corporate rate. In fact, one of the goals of tax reform is to lower the overall corporate rate by removing the system of distortive tax preferences that require companies to change their behavior in order to qualify. . What was surprising, though, was the extent to which these companies were able to delay or defer the payment of the federal taxes they accrued. Most of the companies in our study deferred more than they actually paid. When the deferred taxes are subtracted from the amount these 20 companies owe, their average “current” tax rate drops to 11.7 percent. The independent oil and gas companies in the bottom half of our list, excluding the ones that recorded losses for the period, deferred almost all of the federal income taxes they accrued during the last five years, reporting an average current tax rate of just 3.7 percent. ..."

Much of the reason less regard is paid to the Climate is the fact that they BUY THEIR PRESENT CLIMATE. In the World Economy...a dollar spent in the private sector turns (stimulates) about 13 times. One of the reasons we Goldwater conservatives dislike government excess spending is because those Dollars turn 6-10 times in the economy instead of 13 times....& far less when that money is spent on the military.

(( They All Said it ! )) In July 2016, while he was chairman of the Trump campaign, Paul Manafort flatly denied any ties existed between the campaign and Russia, calling the idea “absurd” in an ABC News interview. Two days after Trump’s victory, Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said, “There was no communication between the campaign and any foreign entity during the campaign.” Asked in January 2017 if there had been contacts with Russians, Trump replied, “No, not at all.” These blanket denials were later repeated by Vice President Mike Pence, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway and White House press secretary Sarah Sanders. ----------------------- Now, Yes ! ! There were many RUSSIAN CONTACTS. ((They ALL admit it ! )) These adamant denials have been eviscerated in the two-plus years since the election. At least 16 Trump associates had contacts with Russians during the campaign or before the inauguration, according to public statements, court filings, and news reports. Senior campaign aides and members of Trump’s family were in contact with Russians through in-person meetings, phone calls, emails, Twitter messages and more. Trump now acknowledges that there were contacts but says there was no collusion. --------------------- “Donald Trump told a room of Jewish Republicans, ‘You’re not going to support me because I don’t want your money’ adding ‘you want to control your politicians, that’s fine'” (( They ALL Admit it ! )) -------------------- “For Putin, TRUMP is return on his investment. It’s safe to say that his investment in Trump & US Election Meddling has paid off beyond even his wildest dreams!” . HELL'S BELLS, A Russian Heavily ARMED and Russian LED mercenary army HAS ATTACKED US TROOPS in Syria a few months ago. Our Commanders tried, for 3 (three) days to gain authorization from the White House to DEFEND THEMSELVES. Having failed to Contact our Commander In Chief, OUR troops HAD to rely on OBAMA ERA standing orders, in order to defend themselves and counter attack. 1. President Trump SAID NOTHING about this RUSSIAN attack 2. President Trump DID NOTHING about this RUSSIAN ATTACK! but he did hold top SECRET meetings with PUTIN. he did invited Putin to Washington, DC for a visit. he was invited BACK to Moscow He did ask that Russia be readmitted to the G8, despite having just attacked US TROOPS. He did kiss the ARS of the RUSSIAN BEAR by GRABBING DEFEAT FROM THE JAWS OF VICTORY & ordered US troops out of Syria...which is precisely what the Russian Oligarch Putin wanted! He did continue to attack European Leaders, Trade Policies, Defense Policies, Nato as Putin wanted. Those European nations HAD NOT ATTACKED US TROOPS.

We could either reduce taxes and let the new technologies out compete the obsolete systems we depend on now, or we could keep taxes the same and simply redirect the subsidies we use for fossil fuels and destructive industrialized agriculture towards modern sustainable systems instead. The one thing that won’t work is keep the tax and spend schemes the Neo-Luddites have made for themselves now, and also add even more tax and spend schemes for their competing new technologies too! Yes that’s right, the top two causes for global warming are heavily subsidized.[1][2][3][4] It is literally insanity. in·san·i·ty in'san?de/ noun the state of being seriously mentally ill; extreme foolishness or irrationality. We can reverse AGW though, and save money doing it. Here are three proposals. One made by me and two more similar ones. Here you can see how some might include a carbon market and ways we could do it without a carbon market. They are all workable. The main thing is that they are all stand alone solutions that have beneficial sides effects instead of detrimental side effects to the land and society. We should do them even if AGW wasn’t real. They would still be hugely beneficial all around. There is no negative down side. Win/win for all. Credit: Joel Pett | USA Today 1] Scott Strough's answer to Can we reverse global warming? Executive summary: Yes we can reverse Global Warming. It does not require huge tax increases or overly expensive untested risky technologies. It will require a three pronged approach worldwide. 1] Reduce fossil fuel use by replacing energy needs with as many feasible renewables as current technology allows. . ((solar & wind Cost less & are quicker to construct + + they produce FAR less expensive electricity than coal)) . Change Agricultural methods to high yielding regenerative models of production made possible by recent biological & agricultural science advancements. Large scale ecosystem recovery projects similar to the Loess Plateau project, National Parks like Yellowstone etc. where appropriate and applicable. 2] Project Drawdown The list is comprised primarily of “no regrets” solutions—actions that make sense to take regardless of their climate impact since they have intrinsic benefits to communities and economies. These initiatives improve lives, create jobs, restore the environment, enhance security, generate resilience, and advance human health.[5] 3] Farming a climate change solution Farmers have a golden solution to global warming largely missed by climate change pundits, right beneath their feet. The innovative Australian Soil Carbon Accreditation Scheme is showing how incentive payments can be received by landholders for measurable increases in soil carbon that soaks up CO2 from the atmosphere. Financial incentives could help fund soil restoration efforts, which in turn bring the bonus of greater productivity, drought resilience and even rain. The action is deep underground.[6] Footnotes [1] The $200 Billion Fossil Fuel Subsidy You've Never Heard Of (USA) [2] Fossil fuel subsidies are a staggering $5 tn per year | John Abraham [3] Fossil Fuel Subsidies Top $450 Billion Annually, Study Says (USA w various costs,supports) [4] Milking taxpayers [5] Solutions | Drawdown [6] http://www.amazingcarbon.com/PDF...

You mumbo jumbo doesn't have correlation and or coherent thought. Do you have direct evidence humans never existed during the time when co2 levels were higher? And just because humans, may not, have evolved yet, life has been on earth since the beginning of earth's creation. 4.54 billion years ago earth was created, earliest undisputed evidence of life on Earth dates from at least 3.5 billion years ago. There is evidence that life began much earlier. You say goldilocks for humans, where does this even come from? You just say things that try to match what you claim, but when in reality, it's just words and has no basis in reality. Air vs co2, co2 is 0.006% of our current atmosphere. 6% is when humans die, due to the partial pressure of co2 inside the body and not able to exhale it from the body. 0.006%- 6%, is a huge range, how do you arbitrary say 0.006% is goldilocks for earth and humans, if it's been higher before and life exist.

Conversely, When they return toward the Earth, oceans warm triggering CO2 release & Massive Warming. This Is where CO2 & other greenhouse gasses take control of the Inter Glacial Warm Periods for thousands of years. . (THIS Holocene Inter Glacial Warm Period PEAKED in temperatures 7,500-9,000 years ago) . Since then, there has been an overall cooling trend, consistent with a continuation of this 'NATURAL' cycle, This cooling should continue for tens of thousands of years into the future if all else remained the same."

Wow, what's the co2 limit in a submarine? 5000ppm. Nice try. Co2 is not an issue with global warming. The ocean warms, due to temperature, and with the hotter water temps, more co2 cannot dissolve in the oceans and hence, we see the reason, hotter temps show higher co2 levels, this is only half true. Because the oceans got hotter, there is more co2 in the atmosphere, see the issue with there thinking. It's not co2 causing the warming, it's the warming rising co2 levels. Grow more trees to absorb the co2.	UCAIydsdpHyIFgj6Gx5qgsuw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAIydsdpHyIFgj6Gx5qgsuw	1	UgxNgjC8PHYBU25SINx4AaABAg	Ron Young

CO2 Kills! . CO2 is a pollutant which kills, since it IS a poison kills, since it IS an Asphyxiant (heavier than air, it smothers life) . (the higher the level of CO2, the lower the level of Oxygen) . EVERY LARGE Building requires Fresh Air Recirculation Sytems to fight the VERY HARMFUL effects of CO2 settling in basements and SEALED ROOMS. AS CO2 atmospheric levels increase so does the THREAT of CO2 in basements, sealed rooms and protected valleys and glades. * "Police: Carbon dioxide led to death in McDonald's bathroom September 14, 2011 1:38 p.m. EDT STORY HIGHLIGHTS: The carbon dioxide built up to toxic levels in the bathroom An 80-year-old woman died after the incident September 7, lethal dose of carbon dioxide, authorities said Wednesday...." * CO2 is heavier than air, so the concentration near the floor will be much higher," as well as protected glades, basements and sealed rooms. .

The UN has admitted that the goal is not saving the planet, but rather, destroying capitalism. But the masses are easy to fool especially when you indoctrinate them from kindergarten thru college. Of course, the elites have no intention of living under socialism/communism, they intend to rule over it. Stalin, Castro, etc., never waited on line for a piece of government cheese. Only the people did. (see present day Venezuela) That&#39;s why the democrats are so intent on taking your guns. An armed population would never stand for what the democrats have in store for them and the democrats know it.	UC0g21oMNyjnKBhTr_C7TxYg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0g21oMNyjnKBhTr_C7TxYg	0

In the last 1000 years there were 6 centuries with a larger differential of average temperature than in the 1900&#39;s. But somehow that is ignored. We went from an impending ice age, to global warming, now it&#39;s just &quot;climate change&quot;, somehow THAT is ignored. EVERY high profile long term temperate model has FAILED to pan out, has not met the standards set forth by the scientists who made the predictions, but somehow THAT is ignored. When are they actually going to do anything remotely close to the &quot;scientific method&quot;, you know, where they use REAL science instead of just guessing what carbon is going to do, or losing their minds about 1/2 of ONE degree centigrade? BTW, there is no scientific consensus, &quot;John Cook et al&quot; was debunked a decade or more ago, yet here people are still claiming it is real, because of good ole&#39; Wonkepedia. Sad...

RE: TONY HELLER....and his alias....STEVEN GODDARD . "Thursday, 17 November 2016 Climate-change Report: Record Global COOLING Over Last Eight Months Written by Warren Mass . While the climate change doomsayers constantly harp about global warming, climate blogger Tony Heller reported on November 13(2016) that over the last eight months, global temperatures over land have cooled a record 1.2°C. " ------------- FACT! (( Over 1700 out of 1763 TV Stations in the USA reported that 2016 was a SCORCHER Record hot YEAR)) ------------- Take a look at NOTED Denier's UAH data for 2016--reports a dramatic record hot year. --- http://www.drroyspencer.com/wp-content/uploads/UAH-v6-LT-NExt-thru-feb-2016-2.jpg ------------ FACT! " TONY HELLER (aka Steven Goddard) TESTIFIED that temperatures had fallen a remarkable 1.2C" ------------ Tony Heller’s findings were charted on a graph posted on the website realclimatescience.com. A biographical sketch on the International Conferences on Climate Change website created by the Heartland Institute notes that Heller “has spent much of the past seven years studying the history of extreme weather, as well as the history and methodology behind the reported NOAA/NASA temperature record.” FACT! (( ----TONY HELLER aka Steven Goddard is an electrical Engineer & has never studied climate & never reported or published any actual research----)) "While this latest report may come as a surprise to many people, longtime readers of The New American will not be among them. Our publication has published numerous reports over the past several years offering evidence that not only are periods of global warming more likely to be the result of natural cyclical changes than human activity, but that the warming process has reversed itself and our Earth actually have entered a cooling period."

There were periods between 1000 and 2000 AD that had a full 3 degree C differential, and you are claiming "1.0 historical norms". Which way, "Rich", up or down, considering that the temperature has gone up and down at a greater differential 6 separate centuries in that same time period I stated above.

Dr. SPENCER: “my UAH cohort & boss John Christy, who does the detailed matching between satellites, is pretty convinced that the RSS data is undergoing SPURIOUS COOLING because RSS is still using the old NOAA-15 satellite which has a decaying orbit..." . While every one else correct the errors in sat. data thru mathematics but they had accused others of manipulating data sooo... .

We are MEASURING the increase AND the acceleration. The Ocean levels are RISING (Past tense; RISEN). Entire Pacific Island Atoll Nations are DISAPPEARING by the SQUARE MILE. Some of these Nations have gone partly UNDERWATER. The Ice Caps are GONE (No longer disappearing; GONE). The North Pole Planetary Ice Cap barely exists now; it has become an OPEN SEA. Rhode Island sized pieces of ANTARCTICA are breaking off. One vast section of it nearly the size of JAMAICA broke off. The Earth&#39;s FORESTS are being CUT DOWN by human deforestation (This is removing OXYGEN from the ATMOSPHERE). There is a growing HOLE in our ATMOSPHERE (We detected this and have been MONITORING IT). Human Impact on planet Earth is EXACERBATING an ALREADY Naturally occurring planetary warming trend. EXACERBATING it. FAR BEYOND how it would NATURALLY occurs. Not only is it human industrial and combustion engine emissions, it is Human POLLUTION of the planetary environment and vastly increasing (Human population on Earth) adding of Human wastes; synthetic man-made wastes that are poisoning water, soil and air.

Ugzap8bJpWHaYu6J8RR4AaABAg	0	1	2018-11-24 12:29:23	Just Anoman	I do agree that a chance of catastrophic result is low. The problem is, it&#39;s a gamble that we can&#39;t afford to lose.<br />I&#39;m even fine with the sea actually rising 20 feet. Sure, a huge chunk of humans might die, but that&#39;s not really a big deal in the grand scheme of things. There will be enough left to preserve civilization and that&#39;s all that really matters long term. I mean, as individuals, we are all gonna die eventually, so whatever.<br /><br />The problem really lies in a more significant increase due to potential run away reactions, which will in turn kill plant and animals, thus depriving us of food and finally kill all but a few of us. That is the real problem. The chance of something this is extreme is pretty slim. It&#39;s probably not much higher than the chance of apocalypse by epidemic or by meteor. Still, it&#39;s a gamble and we can&#39;t afford to lose it, not until we can colonize some other rock. The real question therefore, is whether we should be take the gamble given the low chance of losing.<br /><br />Of course, if you are squeamish and can&#39;t deal with couple hundred millions or even billions dying, then you stand a greater chance of losing. Still might not be very big, but significantly larger than humanity being wiped out.	UC-qoVUSdt0sf6xmu_qq_iMw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-qoVUSdt0sf6xmu_qq_iMw	0

But the gas and coal companies that stand to make billions by denying it, they are telling the truth? Most of the things we need to do to try and mitigate climate change are beneficial even if climate change is not as serious of a problem as some would believe. Coal and oil pollute the planet regardless of their effect on climate change, so does the consumption of factory farmed animals. Solar energy is very profitable industry that we should be investing in regardless. We only have 50 to 100 years of fossil fuels left in the ground anyway. We might as well start transitioning now.

Another example is whether you will live if you jump out of a plane without a parachute now the last ten thousand times it happened nobody survived but I can show you one instance where a person did survive now you might be that person but it is extremely likely you will die instead similarly it is extremely likely that global warming is caused by humans is what the scientists are saying so are you still ready to jump out of the plane without a parachute ...

There have been many great shifts in the earth's climate way before the population of man. We do not know much about the earth's cycles . As I mentioned before, some claim sun spots are the cause. We just don't know for certain at this point. It is interesting you bring up " Flat Earthers". The typical pejorative used by global warmers against anyone who sees things differently. Climate change is a money maker for the few elite. It is not a " settled science." I am far from alone in this opinion. If you believe weather changes in earth are due to mankind, have at it. I and many others do not agree with that premise. As I have said, we will agree to disagree. Have a sunny day.

Any scientist who disagrees is called a " climate change denier." Government indeed funds alternative energy. Have you been to a College campus lately? It is run by the Alt Left, collective thought. Climate change, what happened to " Global Warming?" It seems too many blizzards interrupted Al Gore's lucrative speaking tours. His many mansions should be under water by now. All the dire predictions made by these scientists have not come to pass. There is a polar bear population explosion in Alaska. Direct your concern for the planet to China and India, the biggest polluters in the world. We will agree to disagree on this matter.

Progressive thought is indeed collective thought and climate change is just one of the things they are pushing. Why are only scientists who agree with climate change the ones getting the funding? Indeed there are many scientists who think any change in weather is due to sun spots and other factors. Alternative fuel, wind, solar, is still backed up by fossil fuel. Alternative fuel is subsidized by the government. Maybe someday we will get there but for the moment we rely on fossil fuel for energy. When alternative fuel becomes reliable it will be through private investors, not the government. You can burn clean coal. What happened to Solyndra? Obama invested tax payer money and where is it now? Belly up. How did we recover environmentally from the industrial revolution? The Earth can right itself. America is doing her part in regards to the environment. Colleges are subsidized by government. They teach or a better word is indoctrinate their students to the climate change religion. Critical thought and disagreement are not allowed. A sad fact in today's education.

Recovery is projected to continue over the next century, and the ozone hole is expected to reach pre-1980 levels by around 2075." so regulation does work to an extent also newer studies show that it might not be closing	UCouLqzdmPxlmyhE9sPUgUlg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCouLqzdmPxlmyhE9sPUgUlg	1	UgxfOMV9OX1Zc0OPXX54AaABAg	madmotorcyclist

Yes.<br />2. Have humans increased carbon gas emissions? Yes.<br />3. Does this increased carbon atmosphere insulate more heat? Yes.<br />4. Does our more insulated atmosphere affect the climate? Yes.<br />4.a- For one thing, it means that ocean waters evaporate at an increased rate without an increased rate of condensation. This causes the ocean to become more acidic as it becomes more salty. I think we know that isn&#39;t exactly good for the wildlife.

Cold fronts shouldn't be able to form in the first place. 2. Plants "breathe" in carbon, just plant more and stop killing weeds. 3. If this was that simple then we shouldn't technically have any winter weather or it would be hot at night everywhere because of too much trapped heat. Also heat rises and do you know the temperature at 30,000 feet? 4. How much of the climate is affected, you don't know. Droughts and storms would happen with or without climate change. 4a. How do you explain record rainfall now then this year? You know it does rain over the ocean too and storm drains in California head back to the ocean.

If you have a PHD in hard science you shouldn't have a problem getting research dollars and there would be no need for inventing a crisis. Do you have any idea how much coordination and time that would take, to fake a problem of this scale? We are anonymous here. Just tell the truth. You believe the science and you just don't care what happens to the planet after you're gone. You can't actually believe the hoax theory of the climate crisis, a theory so stupid it makes flat earthers look credible by comparison.

Did martians have smokestacks and capitalists?<br /><br /><br />Originally posed by Dr Thomas Sowell. Global temperatures rose first, then CO2 levels went up. If &quot;A&quot; causes &quot;B&quot;, doesn&#39;t &quot;A&quot; have to happen first?<br /><br /><br />If CO2 levels are continuously rising, why has there been a pause in global warming for the last 15 years or so? <br />Climate cultists discount the activity of the sun as a cause of climate change here on earth but it plays a significant role in our climate (obviously). They also tend to discount the weather system which utilizes a lot of excess energy and regulates/moderates the temperature of the earth with clouds and wind and hurricanes and ice formation and ice melting and such. If, in fact, we have excess heat, why has the frequency of hurricanes declined? Why has the polar ice cap in the South pole INCREASED in size ? If &quot;climate change&quot; is a crisis, can you point to a period in world history when the climate remained static? Has there ever been a significant &quot;change&quot; in global climate PRIOR to man&#39;s impact (for instance...oh let&#39;s say and ice age?)<br />Things that make you go Hmmmmmmm...

He has spent most of his adult life fighting the climate change fear mongers. Watch an interview with Dr. Michaels by Mark Levin on Youtube. Dr. Michaels explains how most of the climate change software is rigged. Who owns the climate change software: the governments do. What&#39;s wrong with the government climate change software: it&#39;s called parameterization. They must enter numbers for the jet stream to figure out x, y, and z. The figure they enter is wrong or parameterized (as they call it) which in turn makes it like the sky is falling thus you have severe climate change. Apparently, the Russians are the only people who don&#39;t cheat on their model and it is the most correct one which doesn&#39;t agree with the rest of the world&#39;s other government models. This is why President Trump pulled us out of the Paris Accord. The one reason was that the United States was going to be paying and doing so much more than anyone else which was unfair especially since there is no real climate change. We have been through 5 ice ages. The climate is constantly changing. It&#39;s a disgrace how the governments of the world are holding onto this farce all in the name of money. If the governments really believed what they were saying they would outlaw meat. We are clear-cutting forest for large-scale factory farms to feed the populations. All the factory farms put together are putting more methane&gt;co2 into the air than all of the factories and all of the vehicles on this planet combined! Do you even hear one peep about that? Of course not...such a disgrace...the corruption in our governments is out of control and most people are so brainwashed about climate change because it has become a new religion.

More people die from cold than heat Lots more wildlife dies from cold than heat The Great Barrier Reef has dead areas from several different causes. Heat is not a major factor Silt is Chemicals are the number one reason for certain large areas dieing off. Mostly from run off from Australia. The nutrients increase algee growth and algee chokes coral. Coral grows very slowly. Mechanical damage from ships, anchors, recreational divers, etc can take decades to replace what can be destroyed in an hour. Coral reefs have a life cycle. As coral reefs grow, the Coral's consume the plankton at an ever increasing rate, until there is no longer enough to feed the reef. At this point all, or at least large portions of the reef die. This is natural, and not caused by man. In the '70's coral die offs in the Great Barrier Reef we're being blamed on Global Cooling. Today it's Global Warming. The coral reefs get used as a means to generate emotional feelings for political gain. Yes I am an oceanographer. Started back at n '79. Stop using climate like it's something we can control. We can't. Humans only produce 0.002% of the CO2. Nature produces the rest. Warming and cooling are a side effect of the Sun's activity. We can not control it.

So while not getting arrested for smoking weed alot of their other Policies don't (such as Private Social Security, less safety regulations, their views on Healthcare, Private Education, less Unionization/Worker Protection laws etc). *while countries that embraced Socialism become incredibly poor* While you fail to mention Social Democracies which beat out other Nations such as Australia, Canada, Denmark, Sweden etc. Onto the next mentally disabled Child. *so do you think anything from Soros checkbook must be true?* What is the Soros checkbook even? *Leave your leftist denial of science at the door bitch* Do you deny man made Climate change yes or no? if yes then you have a right wing denial of Science as Climate change is verified Science. *while never holding these corporations responsible for their gross pollution?* Which is the thing i am personally for as Corporations cause a majority of the Climate change (about 71 to 73 percent) thereby should be punished more then the Citizens are for it. In more Centrist areas they try punishing the Citizens instead of the Corporations (like Macron in France did). Now onto the final one *see, I can play the same game* I have presented evidence for mine which makes it valid. Stossel is connected to reason.com, reason.com is connected to the Koch Brothers as they founded it/still probably fund if not outright run it) thereby Stossel is connected to them, promoting their ideas (90 to 95 percent which suck the rest which can be reasonable).

Do you know/view MIMIC-TPW, CONUS, NOAA&#39;s west coast and Alaskan water vapor loops? Do you study EOSDIS Worldview images as well? If you do even a tiny bit of viewing the above images you&#39;ll realize our weather IS manipulated. Please, please tale time to view 1PacificRedwood videos. I&#39;ve been capturing sky pics for about 10 years now...you should look up and realize the crap in our skies and the effects of it. Best look up D.E.W. too and see how it was used in the 2018 SoCal fires...<br />On another topic...did you ever notice that President Obama is a stutterer? I was a pretty serious stutterer for a number of years and at 70 plus my degree is Speech Path and Audiology i can hear the patterns quickly in a person&#39;s speech. I noticed his pattern the very first time he appeared on the national scene. I was actually in another room listening to the intro and when he spoke and I thought holy cow; he&#39;s a stutterer and raced in to see with my eyes as well. <br />I have also noticed how cannabis lessens stuttering...but I digress. <br />Watch some 1PRs!!!!! please. You&#39;ll be in good company; he has &#39;Global warnings&#39; attached to his videos and his counts are all manipulated.

I fly planes and race bikes, I am a petrol head, but that doesn’t lead me to deny he facts. Global warming is not going to be a problem for me in my lifetime but we are changing the climate and it has to be checked at some point before. 50 years from now I believe he changes will by then be significant enough that you won’t need to be a scientist to get it.

There are so many factors which influence the changing of climate. The Sun and Water vapour are 2 of the biggest factors. Only 2% of gas in the atmosphere is Greenhouse gasses. Out of that 2%, only 4% is Co2, and 1% Methane, the rest (95%) is Water vapour from the ocean. If you do the math, Co2 only account for 0.04% of the total atmosphere. It is so tiny and insignificant factor in Climate. Even then, most of Co2 are produced by Volcanoes and UNDERWATER Volcanoes. Do you know that 80% of volcanoes are underwater!? Planet Earth&#39;s surface is 70% water <br />This isnt about saving the planet it&#39;s about control.<br />They want to kill off 80% of <br />the worlds population.

You can&#39;t (lawfully) strip down much further than shorts, tank and flip-flops. We should be proactive in preventing the heat from rising further, even if it&#39;s just to take the time many of the big businesses/polluters and the consumers/polluters need to change their ways, or to save the great great grandchildren from excessive heat. If we don&#39;t get on it, what generation will? I don&#39;t think underestimation or procrastination in the face of this gradually increasing threat is the answer. I do think that it should be 1 of many problems that need to be fixed. I&#39;m not at all advocating we abandon more pressing matters. We have big, under-worked/distracted government, and a large, resourceful country capable of doing more than it is. Let&#39;s use that to MULTITASK and try to actually reach the potential we have. Maybe don&#39;t issue subsidies to the rich. Maybe issue subsidies to the poor, instead. We tried the carrot with big businesses like auto manufacturers and energy producers. Unfortunately, they used that money either for sub-par products or to put it right back into business as usual. It&#39;s time for the stick. There are distribution of noxious substance laws already on the books. What we need is enforcement of those laws, adoption of those laws into the US Code, and therefore tougher sentencing upon conviction. Those laws should apply 1st to businesses, then 10 years later, to consumers. I believe that most businesses and consumers, within 20 years of the passing of laws like that, would comply and that we&#39;d see a slight drop in global temperature within 10 years after both sets of laws are passed. If not, then those laws could and should be repealed. I do believe those laws would work. Besides, it&#39;s about time for the government to back up those words about climate change with action, anyway. If not, they should just knock it off, repeal all &quot;Green Tyranny&quot; laws and abolish the seemingly useless EPA and similar government organizations for much-needed budget cuts and freer commerce... See what happens to the global temps within 10 years after then, Mr. Stossel.	UCCL-R2jWS-ThxF-gttJrp9g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCL-R2jWS-ThxF-gttJrp9g	0

Climate change is the excuse that politicians and federal agencies use to willfully and knowingly cripple and overtly tax the entire population into financial dependency on the government. The EPA is the biggest culprit in this regard and even fines individuals $40,000/day for something as simple as cleaning a gutter that is federal property. Federal agencies abuse their unlawful authority to steal private property and to shut down businesses and competitors to the lobbyists in Congress. It&#39;s all a series of groups giving each other kick backs and unlimited supplies of cash and favors at the cost of Americans lives, finances, and freedoms.

The co-pilot turns to the pilot and says shouldn&#39;t we change course? The pilot replies &quot;No, the controller has been saying that for the last half hour and has been wrong every time&quot; <br /><br /><br />If the Greenland ice sheet did slide into the ocean and world sea levels rose - we can&#39;t put it back. So what is the harm with developing industries that slow or reverse climate change? None. In fact developing an entire new ecological industry would be like a second industrial revolution. It would create millions of jobs and generate trillions in economic activity. So what&#39;s the matter with you - you don&#39;t like money?

I don&#39;t know even 1 scientist who agrees with this that does not work for the governments. It&#39;s stupid to think that there will suddenly be MORE water than there is now. People are constantly displacing sand from the bottom of the ocean to make cement. If they&#39;re digging and making the hole bigger, will that make water rise or sink? Take an ice cube out of a glass of water, or let it melt. The water stays the same if it melts or the level sinks when a cube is removed.

Almost, but watching your video with an open mind I realized you approached this topic realistically. I recently discovered your channel and have been happy for it. So I’m glad you did it the right way.<br /><br />Data shows the climate is changing. That’s not up for debate. That is the problem coming from the Right – they deny it’s happening. It is not. It’s settled research because the data doesn’t lie. Interpretation of data can change over time and models are never accurate, they help learn and understand impact of data, which must be refined over time, and that means conclusions change. It’s how science works. When politics and business take over science you no longer get science.<br /><br />The real 3 questions we should focus on: <br /><br />a) is it a problem at all and if so should it be worried about? b) should we try and fix it? c) if we agree we should fix it how do we fix it? <br /><br />Those 3 questions aren’t being dealt with. <br /><br />You have a) it is doom heading our way! b) we have a plan that costs money form the paris accords and anyone that doesn’t agree is a science denier and c) if you don’t agree you’re a science denier.<br /><br />The problem is that most people I talk to on the right are the actual science denier.<br /><br />Stop arguing with the data, instead address the 3 REAL questions.<br /><br />And I think you addressed that in your short video. I’d like to see you do a more in depth story on this. <br /><br />BTW – I’m glad you’re here and back.	UC5zShtmOAUUMBO-LGFjY_Ew	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5zShtmOAUUMBO-LGFjY_Ew	0

UgzlJIXDFzSfpZujFkp4AaABAg	27	31	2018-10-19 20:00:01	Old Frugal One Hyper-Drive Movement	The biggest lie ever told to the world is Man Made Global Warming. Man has nothing to do with it - never has. Climate change is real and it will always change. Climate is cyclical and is controlled by the sun. The &quot;Modern warm period&quot; ended in 2016 and we are now descending into a Grand Solar Minimum. Man contributes 0.04% of CO2 to the total atmosphere the rest comes from the oceans and volcanos. Colder oceans capture CO2 and a warmer ocean releases CO2. CO2 rise always lags temperature and is a result not the cause of temperature rise. Since 2016 overall world temperature has fallen by 0.8 C and will continue to fall as the Grand Solar Minimum deepens. Artic sea ice is on the rise, glaciers across the globe are advancing,. Crop loss will be the biggest threat to man in the coming days. Losses are already happening across the globe and we are just at the beginning. By 2030 we will be at Maunder Minimum levels. This winter 2018-2019 will be early and last long into the spring. Record cold and snow have already been reported here in mid October. GSM means wilder weather patterns with more snow, more rain, more droughts, and warmer in some regions colder in others. Don&#39;t believe the lie any longer. Do your own research - the truth is out there. You just won&#39;t hear it from the main stream media until it&#39;s too late.

We are pouring gasoline on the fire that is Raising Temps. around the globe created by the continued increasing use of Fossil Fuels..... . Dear CHILD.... human beings HAVE NEVER EXISTED with CO2 below 180ppm or humans beings HAVE NEVER EXISTED ABOVE 290ppm. OUR entire physiology is BASED on those numbers. WE HAVE EVOLVED WITH THOSE NUMBERS! Nearly every animal on earth and Nearly every plant on earth-------> if transplanted to the 1,600 ppm you are advocating WOULD DIE with in day ! . 1. CO2 has beneficially enabled life on Earth. (holding infra-red heat/warming the planet so life may proliferate) (has some fertilizer effect) (without CO2 + other Green House gases, Earth would be a Cold 3rd ROCK 0 degrees F.) . This is the story of a little is good and a lot is deadly...take Aspirin, for example. The Goldi Locks Level for humans:----> atmospheric CO2 has always been between 180ppm & 290ppm! 2. CO2 has boosted plant life on Earth BUT . Coincidentally, as CO2 levels have increased, -------------> Nutrient values have FALLEN at a Faster Rate ! . LESS iron LESS protein LESS Zinc Less Copper etc. . IN all of the Staple Grains that the world has become dependent upon ! So you see, CO2 has some current benefits & some immediate challenges to human well being ! . https://www.natureworldnews.com/articles/15166/20150615/climate-change-plants-choke-much-carbon.htm . 3. CO2 Kills! . CO2 is a pollutant which kills, since it IS a poison kills, since it IS an asphyxiant (heavier than air, it forces out oxygen & it smothers life. ALL LIFE) . (the higher the level of CO2, the lower the level of Oxygen) . EVERY LARGE Building requires Fresh Air Re-circulation Systems to fight the VERY HARMFUL effects of CO2 settling in basements and SEALED ROOMS. AS CO2 atmospheric levels increase so does the THREAT of CO2 in basements, sealed rooms & protected valleys. * "Police: Carbon dioxide led to death in McDonald's bathroom September 14. STORY HIGHLIGHTS: The carbon dioxide built up to toxic levels in the bathroom An 80-year-old woman died after the incident September 7, lethal dose of carbon dioxide, authorities said Wednesday...." * CO2 is heavier than air. . "Higher Concentrations of CO2 in the Atmosphere increases incidents of threatening concentrations at ground levels & basements..." * "One person, recounting the fate of eight men and one woman who walked into a basement area where the gas had accumulated, said they “fell down DEAD as if they had been shot.” * EVERY large building on EARTH has Fresh Air Re-circulation Systems in order to fight off effects of CO2 build up. ..the higher concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere, increases the threat from CO2 build up in buildings, basements! * "Examples: The plague of diseased livestock: Heat waves can make people ill, & they do the same to livestock such as dairy cows. During a recent heat wave in California, cattle died at such rates that they overwhelmed local capacity for disposing of the carcasses. . The plagues of insects: In a warmer climate, insect pests, weeds, and agricultural diseases will have the chance to invade territory that previously was too cold for them. ((The Pine Beetle can now be found north of Fairbanks Alaska.)) . The plague of extreme weather: Scientists expect that as the climate changes, farmers will contend with intensifying floods and droughts. ------------------------------------------- CO2 effect on vertebrates-------Vic / November 21, 2016 Ocean acidification’s other evil twin ----------> Blood acidification <--------- Going from 280 to 415 ppm CO2 we’ve increased the pH of our blood by 0.1 (equivalent to an increase in acidity of 30%). http://www.smh.com.au/environm.. .

Hell they danced all the way to the bank..They sold a million new Oil Furnaces and stopped congress from limiting Global Warming based on numerous studies presented to President Eisenhower in 1958, and additional studies & spot on accurate projections to 2015 presented to President Johnson in 1965. New Scare headlines about an oncoming Mini Ice age was pushed again in the 1980's, twice in the 1990's, Dr.s Spencer & Christie told us Global Warming would end by 2000 with the NEW GREAT COOLING / MINI ICE AGE. That was postponed to the Solar Minimum in 2007-2009...then to 2015-2018...then to a GRAND SOLAR MINIMUM in 2020...we are to be knee deep in it by 2030 !! --------------------------- With the knowledge that Human Industry/Agriculture were PUMPING over 100 times MORE CO2 & Greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than all Earth's Volcanoes, combined, every year. The World's Leading Scientific Minds & specifically nearly all of NASA LEADING SCIENTISTS, Challenged, Questioned & Critiqued the Effects of Greenhouse Gasses (specifically CO2 as a multiplier effect with Water Vapor) on climate ! In 1970, NASA launched the IRIS/satellite that Observed & Measured Escaping Infra Red THERMAL Energy spectra between 400 cm-1 to 1600 cm-1. ( Google:--------------->IRIS-Satellite Research) In 1996, the Japanese Space Agency launched the IMG/satellite which recorded similar observations. (Google:--------------->IMG-Satellite Research) . Both sets of data were compared to discern any changes in escaping infra red thermal radiation over the 26 year period (Google--------------->Harries Research Study, 2001). . They found a Dramatic DROP in Escaping (earth cooling) Infra Red THERMAL Radiation at the wavelength bands that greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) & methane (CH4) absorb energy ! While ESCAPING Infra Red THERMAL Radiation is DECREASING. -----------------------------------------> Green House Gases were INCREASING ! (hand in glove) The change in ESCAPING I.R. THERMAL radiation is consistent with theoretical expectations / Global Warming Science Predictions. . This Research & Paper found: "direct experimental empirical evidence for a significant increase in the Earth's greenhouse effect" and GLOBAL Warming. . This result has been confirmed by subsequent research & papers using more recent satellite data. . The 1970 and 1997 spectra were compared with additional satellite data from the NASA AIRS satellite launched in 2003 . ( Google----------------------------->Griggs Research Study 2004). . This analysis was extended to 2006 using data from the AURA satellite launched in 2004 . (Google:---------------------------->Chen 2007 research Study) . Both Research papers found the observed differences in CO2 bands matching the expected changes from rising carbon dioxide levels. . * AGAIN------------>We have empirical evidence that increased CO2 is causing an enhanced greenhouse effect. . ** ALL, These research studies & papers  found "direct experimental evidence for a significant increase in the Earth's greenhouse effect" and Global Warming. . ((( If Infra Red HEAT Energy, does not escape, it MUST THEN be retained in our Earth System as . 1. rising temperatures, 2. warming rising seas, 3. melting Ice, along with acidification of oceans.)))

When greenhouse gases absorb infrared heat radiation, that energy heats the atmosphere which in turn re-radiates infrared heat radiation in all directions. . Much of it makes its way back to the earth's lower atmosphere. . Hence we would expect to find more infrared radiation heading downwards. . Surface measurements from 1973 to 2008 find an increasing trend of downward infrared heat radiation returning to earth. . Google this SOURCE:-------------------->(Wang Infra Red Heat 2009) . A regional study over the central Alps found that downward infrared THERMAL radiation is increasing due to the enhanced greenhouse effect. . Google this SOURCE:-------------------->(Philipona 2004) .

So if CO2 falls to ~ 160 PPM plant life will die. So if it gets back up to 1,600 PPM plant life will grow, lots of food for everyone and forget about CO2 causing global warming (now called Climate Change because - well, it wasn't! Doh!). Water vapour driven by sunspots is the driver. So what we need to do is unlock the carbon resources of the earth put there by the last ice age and put it back where it came from - the air. Having schoolchildren en mass protest demanding the government of the day "do something about Climate Change" after being fired up by Socialist teachers shows just how far Socialism has corrupted our society.

Exxon and other fossile fuel industry were actually caught with secret memos about their agenda to spread doubt on climate change by creating hoax climate groups and paying scientist off. But scientists who are trying to save the world is somehow an evil conspiracy. Do your own research you say, there by completely ignoring the scientific method of peer reviewed studies. And there are thousands of studies that actually prove that this is genuine problem. Oh, most of your data is just wrong. But I'm guessing since you don't subscribe to the scientific method you don't really care .

In Deuteronomy 28, Almighty God YAHWEH, told Moses that He would Bless the Nations by making it RAIN (WATER), but, Israel would have to worship the True Living God only, and keep His Commands, and not worship any other false gods (small letter &#39;g&#39;). PLEASE READ DEUTERONOMY 28.All Scientists in CERN Geneva say that the most abundant Element in the World is Hydrogen (God Particle). Hydrogen 2 Oxygen = WATER... WATER= LIFE. Saint Peter said 2000 years ago in 2 Peter 3 Verse 5 in The Holy Bible: They purposely ignore the fact that long ago God gave a command, and the heavens and the earth were created. The earth was formed out of WATER (Hydrogen/God Particle) and by WATER (HOLY SPIRIT). <br />The Holy Bible John 19 Verse 34: <b>One of the soldiers, however, plunged his spear into JESUS&#39;s side, and at once BLOOD and WATER (HOLY SPIRIT/GOD PARTICLE) poured out.</b><br /><br />1 John 5. The Witness about JESUS Christ.<br />JESUS Christ is the one who came with the WATER (HOLY SPIRIT) of His Baptism and the BLOOD of His death. He came not only with the WATER, but both the WATER and the BLOOD. And the Spirit himself testifies that this is true, because the Spirit is TRUTH. There are three witnesses; the SPIRIT, the WATER, and the BLOOD; and all three give the same testimony.<br /><br />God Bless! The manna in the DESERT was the Holy Eucharist, the Body of Christ. Everything begins and ends at the CROSS.<br /><br />There is many places in The Holy Bible where we can compare Almighty God YAHWEH to Our Lord JESUS Christ. The Jews must just read Psalm 22, Psalm 110, Isaiah 52 and 53 and Jeremiah 31 Verses 31 to 35, and the Jews will see the similarity.<br />///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////The Holy Bible is TRUTH.<br />1) Genesis 1 Verses 1 and 2: In the beginning, when God created the Universe, the Earth was formless and desolate. The raging ocean (WATER=Hydrogen2Oxygen=God Particle=LIFE) that covered everything was engulfed in total darkness, and the Power of God (HOLY SPIRIT) was moving over the WATER (WATER=Hydrogen2Oxygen=God Particle=LIFE). When Scientists look for LIFE on other Planets, they look for WATER (WATER=Hydrogen2Oxygen=God Particle=LIFE).<br /><b>John 19 Verse 34: One of the soldiers, however, plunged his spear into JESUS&#39; side, and at once BLOOD and WATER (WATER=Hydrogen2Oxygen=God Particle=LIFE) poured out.</b><br />2000 years ago Saint Peter said in 2 Peter 3 Verse 5: They purposely ignore the fact that long ago God gave a command, and the Heavens and Earth were created. THE EARTH WAS FORMED OUT OF WATER (WATER=Hydrogen2Oxygen=God Particle=LIFE) AND BY WATER (HOLY SPIRIT of the FATHER YAHWEH).<br />2) Genesis 3 Verse 8: That evening, Adam and Eve heard the Lord God <b>WALKING</b> (God has LEGS) in the Garden, and they hid from Him among the trees. But the Lord God <b>CALLED OUT</b> (God has a MOUTH and a VOICE) to the man, &quot;Where are you?&quot; (God was <b>LOOKING</b> for Adam and Eve, so God has EYES). Genesis 18 Verse 1 and 2: The Lord (1) appeared to Abraham at the sacred trees of Mamre. As Abraham was sitting at the entrance of his tent during the hottest part of the day, he looked up and saw *THREE MEN STANDING THERE*(3).<br />Genesis 28 Verses 12 and 13: Jacob dreamt that he saw a stairway reaching from Earth to Heaven, with angels going up and coming down on it. And there was the Lord <b>STANDING</b> (God has FEET) beside him. &quot;I AM the Lord, the God of Abraham and Isaac.&quot;<br />Genesis 32 Verse 30: Jacob said, &quot;I have <b>SEEN</b> God face to face (God has a FACE), and I am still alive.&quot;<br /><br />Isaiah 7 Verse 14: Well, then, the Lord Himself will give you a sign: a young woman (Virgin) who is pregnant will have a Son and will Name Him &#39;Immanuel&#39; (God with Us). Our Lord JESUS Christ is God with Us.<br /><br />Zachariah 10 Verse 1: Ask the Lord for RAIN (WATER=Hydrogen2Oxygen=God Particle=LIFE) in the spring of the year. It is the Lord who sends RAIN CLOUDS and SHOWERS (WATER=Hydrogen2Oxygen=God Particle=LIFE), making the fields green for everyone.<br />Zachariah 14 Verse 17: If any nation refuses to go and worship the Lord Almighty as KING, then RAIN (WATER=Hydrogen2Oxygen=God Particle=LIFE) will not fall on their land.

The most recent Ice Age occurred then, as glaciers covered huge parts of the planet Earth. Since we are no longer covered in ice, obviously the Earth has been naturally warming for the last 2.5 million years.

Only three things have been established: (1) the clear evidence that, yes, the climate is changing; (2) the hypothesis that climate change is caused primarily by human activity; and (3) a broad – indeed overwhelming – consensus among scientists worldwide that the hypothesis is valid, and a consequent spillover of that consensus into the general public. Nothing about these facts adds up to science. <br /> What turns a hypothesis into science is not widespread belief but rather the scientific method. What&#39;s required by the scientific method is a long narrative of data acquired through ongoing experiments out in the real world, out in the field, out in nature in all its dynamism and unpredictability. That&#39;s how all hypotheses in the past have been conclusively corroborated (or &quot;proven,&quot; to use the layman&#39;s term), whether we&#39;re talking about the theory of gravity, the theory of evolution or the theory of mass-energy equivalency. <br /> In the case of the anthropogenic-climate-change hypothesis, most data has been acquired not out in the field but rather in a virtual version of nature created in computers, with all of their modeling and simulation capacity. What emerges is that the primary reason a state of science hasn&#39;t yet been achieved is that scientists have in general approached their professional work not as scientists but rather as high-powered, government-funded video-game designers. It&#39;s not reasonable to expect the general public, with its general lack of scientific education, to realize that scientists have been committing malpractice on climate change for years, but that&#39;s the reality. And that&#39;s why as yet there&#39;s no science. Which, again, is why there are skeptics.	UCq-vxpaBuKKPyO6aW_orQgQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq-vxpaBuKKPyO6aW_orQgQ	0

Ugxv6tvyWzPI1gy_Gz54AaABAg	0	0	2018-09-29 08:21:31	Rustin	This is absolutely, unequivocally, the dumbest video I have ever seen in my entire life. I am not exaggerating. <br /><br />&quot;But why should we turn our lives upside down based on bad models?&quot;. They aren&#39;t bad models. And we don&#39;t have to &quot;turn our lives upside down&quot;, we need to adjust how we obtain energy and shift it away from fossil fuels to renewable resources. That isn&#39;t turning our lives upside down. <br /><br />&quot;We don&#39;t really care whether it warms a degree in the next sixty years...life expectancy doubled&quot; &quot;A few degrees warming might be good&quot; &quot;Many more people die from cold&quot;. We aren&#39;t worrying about a slight increase in mean temperature directly killing people. The change in temperature, even at that scale, destroys our ECOSYSTEMS. We aren&#39;t worried about people dying from the increased temperature, we are worried about people starving to death because of a tremendous lack of resources brought on from the mega-droughts that will affect the Middle-East and American Southwest, not to mention the impending resource wars. <br /><br />There is no &quot;fear-mongering&quot; with climate change. It is happening, and it will cause problems. &quot;there is no agreement as to whether warming is dangerous or not&quot;. Yes there is. There are countless ways in which it will negatively impact us. Melting ice caps and thermal expansion will raise the oceans. This is a fact. Ocean acidification , extreme weather, and largely decreased crop yields are just a few more examples. <br /><br />At the end of the day, you people can deny it all you want. You&#39;ll die before the real problems start, so it&#39;s okay if you want to be self centered and choose not to do something about it and actually provide for the race you belong to. Even if climate change was a &quot;hoax&quot; as deniers like to call it, it doesn&#39;t change the fact that trying to prevent isn&#39;t as destructive as you all believe. Transitioning to renewable sources will not cause a collapse in society. It is objectively better to run a society on renewable resources than fossil fuels. Objectively. &quot;We don&#39;t have endless money, if we want to help people we ought to do what really helps&quot;. Ya, we have money. If we have the money to drop our military into foreign countries and blow them sky high, then I assure you we have the money to do something about climate change. If we have the money to afford luxuries, then I assure you we have the money to do something about climate change. If we have the money to subsidize oil companies, then I assure you we have the money to do the same for renewable energy companies (which we do, but it is hardly enough). <br /><br />It all comes down to the fact that fossil fuel companies are organizations that will do everything in their power to not only stay alive, but thrive in terms of maximizing profit in every way possible. Unfortunately, that enormous power ends up controlling those whose duty it is to protect our society and world. Instead of fulfilling their duty, they instead opt to spread lies and misinformation to influence public opinion and public policy so that it furthers the goal of these organizations. Nearly every climate change denier is a denier because of this. They are either public figures that are payed by these companies, or individual citizens that have fed into the deceit spread by those public figures. They are not deniers because they searched far and wide for the truth by reading over peer-reviewed studies, but instead because they heard their local congressmen say there is nothing to worry about. If they searched deeply for the truth in this matter by looking at peer-reviewed studies, then they would eventually find that truth. That truth being that climate change is real, and is a real problem.	UCfF9oG82M3YulAAoFfeuapA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfF9oG82M3YulAAoFfeuapA	0

UgzA3GHpSbLIrO2gMLZ4AaABAg	0	4	2018-09-29 04:47:16	Stephen Betz	So I see that Google put a bar under this video with a link to Wikipedia saying, &quot;Global warming [exists].&quot; What the heck, man? You don&#39;t even care about the content in John&#39;s video? John&#39;s video clearly says and shows that. Google says they are trying to &quot;prevent misinformation.&quot; Well mighty convenient that you automatically assume that a right-leaning channel on YouTube might need some correcting. I sure am glad about that. I can hear the conversation at Google now...<br />&quot;Of all of the hundreds of videos out there spreading misinformation about countless topics, we better pay special attention to these videos on climate change! We can&#39;t let people come to their own opinions, now! I mean, imagine! John Stossel was probably going to tell us the opposite of that Wikipedia page, but then he got scared when he heard we were gonna forcibly fact-check him! John was going to bring out the crazy guy and show the graph of a unicorn, but thankfully Google prevented that! Good job! ...What? ...You mean the graph John showed was even more clear than the Wikipedia page was? ...That the video actually gave context, too? ...And that the 97% statistic was answered with nuance, not just either blindly restated or blindly refuted? ...How was Google supposed to know that John would do that? I mean, we all know that there is all of this misinformation being spread out there about climate change! The peons and the content-creators can&#39;t be trusted with being objective and truth-seeking! Especially those right-leaning, climate deniers! ...Wha&#39;s that? ...John gave evidence of misinformation and nefarious practices on the left? That&#39;s preposterous! Oil companies are fueling the right deniers! What possible nefarious motivation could left-leaners have? ...What? ...You are saying that it is advantageous and beneficial, both politically and financially, to support government action on climate policies? ... ... ...<br />...It was much worse than we feared...<br /><b>DEMONETIZED....</b><br /><b>ACCOUNT BANNED...</b><br /><b>BOMB STRIKE ORDERED...</b><br /><b>GOOGLE EMPLOYEES READING SPELLS FROM OBAMA SPEECHES...</b><br />... <b>Whew</b> ...Good thing we did away with that dangerous &#39;free speech&#39; idea. It was too dangerous to let people make up their own minds! How would we get the correct opinions, otherwise?&quot;<br />I&#39;m not saying that Google is evil, or that they are automatically wrong and the right is automatically correct. The link to Wikipedia was unnecessary, insulting, and unlikely to actually change anyone&#39;s mind. If they were so set in their ways to be a &quot;climate-denier&quot; that they couldn&#39;t be persuaded by watching videos from people they understand and trust, then a stupid link to a Wikipedia page wasn&#39;t going to help anyway. I am saying we should show some decency to one another, and respect each other&#39;s ability to make their own opinions. Let arguments be won by persuasion and evidence, and not by pressuring, belittling, calling people stupid and telling them what they are allowed to think. Show some respect for people&#39;s intelligence. You reveal how dumb you think people are, and how little you think of them. If people are truly as dumb as you think they are, then we are doomed anyway. Free speech was a good idea. Surely a better long-term approach for truth than politically-advantageous compelled monitoring of people&#39;s thoughts and opinions.

As a matter of fact many scientists using ice core samples that are hundreds of thousands of years old from the Vostok research area of Antarctica suggest that CO2 follows climate changes, not leads it. But just as an example that helps to support my point the Earth&#39;s atmosphere is less than 4/100ths of 1% of the Earth&#39;s gasses and our planet is considerably warmer than Mars who&#39;s atmosphere is 95.3% CO2. H2O is the biggest contributor to the Earth&#39;s greenhouse effect. So the facts about CO2 just don&#39;t add up to being the cause of any warming at all	UCFgu2gs_6CRFv-qvK3OvVbg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFgu2gs_6CRFv-qvK3OvVbg	0		
UgywauqRRUYCbf2KL8d4AaABAg.8lic114zPov8lsVOvp4aTj		0	2018-10-01 21:48:09	1967davethewave	I agree that lack of water vapor is the reason why Mar's atmosphere is so cold. But you if you are making the statement that 4/110ths of 1% of the gas in the earth's atmosphere has anything to do with the regulation of the earth's temperature I would disagree. In a laboratory scientists can show that CO2 holds heat in. But those aren't natural occurrences of CO2 and if CO2 was a really efficient greenhouse gas then even Mars with it's much thinner atmosphere but much, much larger concentration of CO2 gases should be warmer and more temperate. I did misspeak though and you are right, I should have said that there is no agreement that CO2 is causing the temperature to warm on earth, not that it can't cause warming. There is a very interesting article published in National Geographic in 2005 that showed the warming of the planet was consistent over a specified time that it was studied from 1985 to 2000. But this study was of Mars and it showed Mars warming the exact same amount as the Earth during the same period. I take this to mean that the Earth is warming, or at least during the period it was studied and it I also take it to mean that it is being caused by an outside force. Most likely the Sun. But before we jump to any conclusions and blame anything I would submit that there needs to be a totally independent study done by an equal number of scientists that both support and refute that man has a hand in global warming. And that the facts be presented for all to see impartially. My biggest problem is that there is almost no settled science as even great minds like Einstein are questioned again and again by current scientists as new information becomes available. To say anything is settled, except maybe the earth being round, is the exact opposite of what good scientific research is, and I just don't see the evidence to support the case for man made global warming. Human's may cause many other environmental problems but just the huge scale of the atmosphere and it's incredibly dynamic nature, I think, makes it unlikely that we can cause any great harm to it.

Historically, warming often released CO2 into the atmosphere. This does not mean CO2 cannot cause warming. It is in fact a positive feedback loop. The mass of the atmosphere of Mars is about 1/200 of that of the Earth and there is much less water vapor, causing lower temperatures.

Now burning more coal could mask some of the warming caused by increased greenhouse gases which would result in cool, but again burning a lot of coal not a great idea. Letting the planet warm more, yes sea levels would rise and displace people but a BIGGER problem one we are already starting to see is the spread of parasites and pathogens that were once only effecting places on the Equator. I think the key is in recycling the CO2 in the atmosphere in to a cleaner fuel source.	UCU_stFLkWfNTCdd04MniiPw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU_stFLkWfNTCdd04MniiPw	0

Air Before the government began to rein in pollution from smokestacks and tailpipe, dense, dark and even choking smog was a frequent occurrence in American cities and towns. . In 1948, spectators at a football game in Donora, Pennsylvania couldn’t see the players or the ball because of smog from a nearby coal-fired zinc smelter; 20 people died. . In Los Angeles in the 1960s, smog often hid the mountains. . The Clean Air Act of 1970 gave EPA the authority to regulate harmful air pollutants. . One of the most dramatic success stories was lead, which was widely used in paint but also in gasoline to improve engine performance. . EPA estimated that more than 5,000 Americans were dying every year from heart disease linked to lead poisoning; many children were growing up with diminished IQ. . ** By 1974, the EPA began a phase out of lead from gasoline. The gradual effort took until 1995 to completely end the practice, but the result has been a measurable 75 percent drop in blood lead levels in the public. . Thanks to Clean Air Act rules, the levels of many other toxic substances in our air, such as mercury, benzene, and arsenic, have also dropped substantially. . A major update to the law in 1990 allowed EPA to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions from power plants, the main cause of acid rain. Life has begun to come back in acidified lakes in the Adirondacks. Complying with EPA’s air pollution rules has been costly —they’re the biggest burden the agency imposes on the economy. But the federal Office of Management and Budget, analyzing data collected from 2004 to 2014, estimates that the health and other benefits of the rules exceeded the costs ** The Cuyahoga River was once one of the most polluted rivers in the United States as represented by the multitude of times it has caught fire, a recorded number of thirteen starting in 1868. . The most potent blaze occurred in 1952 which caused over $1.3 million in damages however, the most fatal fire happened in 1912 with a documented five deaths. The 1969 fire, which did not incur maximum damages or fatally wound any citizen, was the most covered incident occuring on the river. This was in part because of the developing precedence that sanitation held over industrial actions; the United States was becoming more eco-aware. . Also, due to the shift from industry to technology, waste dumping to recycling Time Magazine produced an article about the incident. This brought mass amount of attention to the Cleveland area and added pressure for hygienic regulation. Inspired by the 1969 river fire, Congress was determined to resolve the issue of land pollution, not just in Cleveland, but throughout the United States. . The legislature passed the National Environment Protection Act (NEPA) which was signed into law on January 1, 1970. This act helped establish the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) which would be given the duties to manage environmental risks and regulate various sanitary-specific policies. . One of the first legislations that the EPA put-forth was the Clean Water Act (1972), which mandated that all rivers throughout the United States be hygienic enough to safely allow mass amounts of swimmers and fish within the water by 1983. Since the 1969 Cuyahoga River fire the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District has invested over $3.5 billion towards the purification of the river and the development of new sewer systems. There is a projection that over the next thirty years the city of Cleveland will further endow over $5 billion to the upkeep of the wastewater system. The river is now home to about sixty different species of fish, there has not been another river fire since 1969, and yearly new waste management programs develop to ensure the sanitation of Cleveland's waterways...."

Nitric oxide gases have greenhouse gas byproducts like ozone, but they aren't totally negative like C02 or methane. Most, like huge majority, of air pollution comes from power generation, so people tend to not give a shit about the not-even-full-percentage-of-total pollution that comes from cars/trucks. The only real accurate statement you made in your whole comment was about how we should switch back to glass bottling. The studies done found that some species of frog, which were prone to hermaphroditism already, were being turned female and affecting population numbers. If you have links to studies done on other species along the lines of plastics affecting their sex/chemical makeup, I'd be more then willing to read them. Although I find it hilarious that you'll trust the conclusions in those papers, but not on the papers about climate that were funded and completed by the same types of institutions. "Hormones injected in cows cause cancer." Source please? I've seen studies about cows who are allowed to live into old age eventually developing cancerous growths from certain types of steroids, but I've never heard anything about the hormones being passed to humans causing it. And then again, at the end, you trust these sources when they report on things that aren't something you totally disagree with..... Why are they trustworthy only sometimes?

UgwHwAOda4hm9-x4J6Z4AaABAg	0	0	2018-09-13 22:47:53	Bradley Holdner	The real enemy...<br /><br />The IPCC was created in 1988 largely due to the efforts of Maurice Strong, a billionaire and self-confessed socialist, as part of a larger campaign to justify giving the United Nations the authority to tax businesses in developed countries and redistribute trillions of dollars a year to developing nations. Strong had previously succeeded in bringing about the creation of the UN Environment Programme in 1972 and served as its first executive director. The IPCC is a joint project of that entity and the World Meteorological Organization.<br /><br />(Strong was subsequently implicated in corruption surrounding the UN’s Oil-for-Food-Program and has resigned from his UN positions. According to John Izzard writing for the Australian publication Quadrant Online, &lt;1&gt; “Following his exposure for bribery and corruption in the UN’s Oil-for-Food scandal Maurice Strong was stripped of many of his 53 international awards and honours he had collected during his lifetime working in dual role of arch conservationist and ruthless businessman.”&lt;1&gt;)<br /><br />Strong and his allies at the UN gave the IPCC a very narrow brief by defining climate change in the Framework Convention on Climate Change, Article 1.2, as “a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods.” IPCC’s mandate is not to study climate change “in the round,” or to look at natural as well as man-made influences on climate. It is to specifically find and report a human impact on climate, and thereby make a scientific case for the adoption of national and international policies that would supposedly reduce that impact.<br /><br />The IPCC is also designed to put political leaders and bureaucrats rather than scientists in control of the research project. It is a membership organization composed of governments, not scientists. The governments that created the IPCC fund it, staff it, select the scientists who get to participate, and revise and rewrite the reports after the scientists have concluded their work. Obviously, this is not how a real scientific organization operates.<br /><br />The IPCC’s first report, released in 1990, admitted that observed climate change was probably due to natural rather than human causes. However, every report since then has claimed with rising certainty that there is a “discernable human impact” on the climate and that steps must be taken to avoid a global climate crisis. There is ample evidence that this level of alarmism and asserted confidence is fueled by political considerations rather than actual science.<br /><br />For example, in 1996, Dr. Frederick Seitz, one of the world’s most prominent and respected physicists, wrote in the Wall Street Journal: &lt;2&gt;“In my more than 60 years as a member of the American scientific community, including service as president of both the National Academy of Sciences and the American Physical Society, I have never witnessed a more disturbing corruption of the peer-review process than the events that led to this IPCC report.”<br /><br />Numerous authors (see here, here, and here)&lt;3&gt; have observed a growing disconnect between the “Summaries for Policymakers,” which are designed to be read and used by political leaders and the media, and the reports themselves. The former systematically remove the expressions of scientific uncertainty and alternative explanations of climate phenomena that were abundantly present in the first three reports, with the obvious intention of misrepresenting the science and fueling unnecessary alarm. By the fourth and fifth assessment reports, even the underlying reports were being purged of ideas and evidence that contradicted the IPCC’s political agenda.<br /><br />In 2009, a hacker or whistle blower made available on the Internet a collection of email exchanges among leading authors and contributors to the IPCC reports. The ensuing scandal, called Climategate, &lt;4&gt; exposed efforts by IPCC authors to withhold data from independent scholars and attempt to prevent peer-reviewed journals from publishing research that undermined or questioned their own work. In 2011 &lt;5&gt; the hacker or whistle blower released a second batch of emails that made even more clear that the IPCC process was broken.

Some people don&#39;t get the idea that the northern and southern hemispheres have different and opposite climates. So when they say &quot;global records&quot;, where exactly are they taking the temperatures at?<br /><br />I think that most young people just don&#39;t know that simple little fact and assume what scientists are telling them. If you take the temperature today in Indiana and compare it with Southern California, Brazil and Australia, you will find that we do not have the same temps. So to claim some kind of global rise in temperatures without considering the seasons are not the same, is naive.<br /><br />And here is another one, England has a warmer climate than most of the northern United States, even though they are at a higher latitude. The driving ocean currents bring warm water to them. So we in Indiana can have -40 degrees F in winter, whereas England can have 35 degrees F on the same day.<br /><br />So exactly why are they continually pulling these numbers to mislead people about &quot;rises in global temperatures&quot; when the globe does not even have consistent temps to begin with? If it is hot in one place, it will be cool in another place, and never too much more than the previous year season. To say &quot;this is the hottest summer on record&quot;, yes, maybe for one place but certainly not for all places. I have known summers that were very hot and summers that were very cool. <br /><br />&quot;Rising global temperatures&quot; are myths based on one thing, money. Today, Indiana is 65 degrees F, last year at this time we were very much warmer, but we have had times of cooler temps in July, long before this so-called &quot;Climate change science&quot;. The climate changes every season in every part of the world. But you can&#39;t convince ignorant children today of that fact because they believe &quot;97% of scientists&quot; are telling them the truth when they themselves can just go look at old newspapers and see the daily temperatures for anywhere in the world and then they will know that some years are warmer and some years are cooler.<br /><br />But cities are warmer than the countryside, and cities on rivers east are warmer than cities to the west on the same rivers.

Rising sea levels can be adjusted to, if that was going to happen. After all, if he had truly believed his own dire warnings would Al Gore have bought an ocean front house in Malibu? Putting money into climate change non-issue does not help the environment nor does it really help mitigate the CO2 going into the atmosphere. <br /><br />AND there is an ever growing amount of scientific studies showing that climate warming is about to change into climate cooling because of the solar cycles. Basically, the Sun is going to sleep. And don&#39;t you know that in all the global warming studies and models they have made, they left the solar cycles out. Could that be why they are all wrong?

The rest (though there might be many) are forgotten about or dismissed. And in a world where grants are everything (with regards to research money), &quot;global warming&quot; is a hot topic (no pun intended). I don&#39;t think most researchers are deliberately dishonest but, again, when it is the difference between &quot;publish or perish&quot;, many will chose to &quot;hedge their bets.&quot; And, as I already said, those studies which don&#39;t report global warming or climate change are quickly swept under the rug. You tell me there won&#39;t be some &quot;fudging&quot; going on. I remember when I was in high school (more years ago than I care to think about), scientists warned us that we were about to enter another ice-age. Or some did and that&#39;s what the journalists jumped on. Is it any different now?<br /><br />And anyhow, do we REALLY want to get the government to get involved?! I don&#39;t think so. They&#39;ll spend a hundred taxpayer dollars to &quot;save&quot; one dollar. Carbon points? Phooey!	UCGNW1GDip7X0Lry3Dzz1n8Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGNW1GDip7X0Lry3Dzz1n8Q	0

All about $ like everything basically is. We will doom ourselves is what will happen. U almost can see it now, I wonder how close we are. What religion is it that god comes down and passes judgement on all of us. Well I think we&#39;re close and need it. In that version I think it happens at the end of it all, well I&#39;d like to revise it to just getting rid of the trash and leave the righteous good ppl to start over. Eventually it will need done again cause history just repeats itself unless we maybe get it right.

For us, this is a problem, and it is a problem that we can only tackle if we work together. For us, this is a problem of national importance, and it is a matter of course that the state is involved in addressing it. I don&#39;t know where John Stossel&#39;s parents live, but I&#39;d imagine he&#39;d be a bit more concerned if they too lived six feet below sea level.

The winters we have here are not the same as 50 years ago. We have more humidity and more weather like Seattle than 50 years ago. Why is that? I dont know. Are these just cyclical changes that happen regularly, maybe, probably. What does this mean? Put up more hay, change some grazing season, save more water? Lets be clear in our vocabulary...climate change and global warming are not the same thing.	UC3Qsf9XQ6hWGkemMG-ubz1w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3Qsf9XQ6hWGkemMG-ubz1w	0

The only real debate is the degree to which human industrial activity is contributing to it. We are not cave men anymore, right? So, why do we need to continue burning carbon fuels to provide energy? Isn&#39;t the smog dense enough? Isn&#39;t the landscape scared enough? Aren&#39;t we now smart enough to develop solar, geothermal, tidal, nuclear, etc. etc.? We CAN do away with carbon fuels. So why are we not? Because it is the big energy corporations (oil &amp; coal predominately), not a small insignificant number of climate scientist, that control the nation&#39;s energy agenda. Energy corporations DO NOT want you to have cheap, clean, and abundant energy. They want you to pay top dollar and for you to be their bitch! Oil and coal are not going away anytime soon. However, we need to start NOW making the switch to nuclear and renewables and and stop the stranglehold energy companies have on America!

It isn&#39;t a question of climate change existing or not existing. That definitely exists, the more pertinent question is how bad is it and what can we do? The answers to those questions are fairly straightforward and not discussed at all in any resemblance of the scientific method. The simple answer is we don&#39;t know, and nothing. We simply don&#39;t have the data to make accurate long term predictions, and the only thing that might change the status quo, if it is bad, is a complete change in global cultural usage of resources. The first problem will fix itself with time, but the second problem is where the circus begins. Half the solutions people are selling is snake oil, and the other half is wishful thinking based on misinformation. Electric cars are not greener, and wind power is even more destructive than hydroelectric power. Don&#39;t even get me started on all these wasteful idiotic recycling programs. I&#39;m all for being ecologically responsible, but let&#39;s not kid ourselves huh. Drinking straws for example are not even close to being a serious problem. All the people that get sick from reusing a dirty steel straw are going to needlessly visit a hospital which are epic sources of waste flow. Most of us waste all kinds of resources around us simply because we don&#39;t think about it as being a type of waste. If there is a problem, then that is the real problem.

In geologic history, climate change/temperature change ... at a fast rate ... 1C per 7,500 years! Noted Skeptic/Denier Dr. John Christie, announced, a few months ago, the world temperatures have been rising each and every decade since the 1st Climate Satellite was measuring in 1978....at the decadal rate of 0.14C. The annual rate is-->1.4C per century ... compared to that fast historical rate is------->1C in 7,500 years ! Plants & Animals had great difficulty evolving & adapting to a rate of -------------->1C per 7,500 years.

That definitely exists, the more pertinent question is how bad is it and what can we do? The answers to those questions are fairly straightforward and not discussed at all in any resemblance of the scientific method. The simple answer is we don't know, and nothing...." Dear Boy, the scientific method is a fairly rigid procedure for investigating. You Claim "we don't know" how bad climate change is. You Claim we can do " nothing" about climate change. THOSE are assumptions NO AT ALL PROVEN IN FACT. For Example: We have had two other man made World Issues that threatened life and economies world wide. ACID RAIN OZONE Hole/Depletion ----- MAN MADE ! ACID RAIN killed off huge swaths of Forests & Fields of grain. ,(1st Documented In Germany, but severely affecting nations around the world), infra structure, Farmlands and many Rivers and creeks around the world ! . "...Acid rain is a rain or any other form of precipitation that is unusually acidic, meaning that it possesses elevated levels of hydrogen ions (low pH). . It has harmful effects on plants, aquatic creatures, & infrastructure. . Mainstream Science determined through Examination, Laboratory Experiments, Scientific Technology, Peer Review, Publication & Replication ((repeatability)): . Acid rain is caused by MAN MADE emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, etc.which react with the water molecules in the atmosphere to produce acids." . Centuries of Human Industry DUMPING TOXIC Gasses & Chemicals into our atmosphere. . Vast Majority sourced to Human Heavy Industry and COAL ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION. . A very Conservative President with allied world leaders took concerted action and ended this assault on our planet. . Other Chemicals were later banned as additional contributors to the damage done to Earth. 1. HUMANS Cause damage to EARTH. 2. HUMANS Can CORRECT those damages to EARTH. * " Smog Deaths In 1948 Led To Clean Air Laws : NPR https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103359330 Apr 22, 2009 - The mill town of Donora, Pa., seen Jan. 1, 1948.

It is constantly being formed & broken down in the high atmosphere, 6.2 to 31 miles (10 to 50 kilometers) above Earth, in the region called the stratosphere. . The Ozone layer has deteriorating due to the release of industrial pollution containing the chemicals chlorine and bromine. . Centuries of Massive Human Industry DUMPING TOXIC Gasses & Chemicals into our atmosphere. . Such deterioration allows large amounts of ultraviolet B rays to reach Earth, which can cause skin cancer and cataracts in humans and harm animals as well. A Truly Conservative President, along with world leaders, took decisive & Affordable Action to fight for Earth. Some additional threats to our climate / atmosphere have been added & proven successful. Google the Montreal Protocols. Thanks to this UNITED Effort....the latest studies indicate a 20%+ healing of Ozone depletion and a reduction of Skin Cancers increase. . NOW you see that humans damage the atmosphere & climate.

I'd be willing to bet it's a LOT higher than the CO2 levels of normal human exhalation; if it weren't, mouth-to-mouth recussitation would not be part of normal first-aid. That's the level/ratio of carbon dioxide and oxygen that we exhale; something that's not predicted to occur for... Well, I don't know if ANY of the models out there are yet predicting when we'll reach that level. As far as the former Vice President being a successful venture capitalist, please remember that his business is selling/trading Carbon offsets and carbon credits. He's a billionaire because of it. (... And is living in a home with ten times the carbon footprint that's supposed to be allowed by the CO2 fanatics, flies around the world in a private jumbo jet to admonish people about their abuse of carbon, but is allowed to get away with it because he pays himself, through his company, for his "Carbon Abuses...") You mentioned the mile of ice over Chicago, back when my first ancestors walked here from Asia. I'm glad you brought that up. As you well know, the ice sheets retreated before human technology had evolved beyond rock knapping; something that produced NO atmospheric pollution. We had developed no industry, and indeed had only just developed the beginnings of agriculture. True, our ancestors at that time DID have campfires, but was the amount of carbon dioxide produced there significant enough to cause the ice sheets to retreat? The main reason why I'm glad you brought it up is because it brings up the dynamic model of weather and climate. In a dynamic model, as carbon dioxide levels increase, so does the growth of plants of all sorts in response, which in turn pulls carbon OUT of the atmosphere. By contrast, static models say that any change, regardless of how small, can lead us to the proverbial "Tipping Point" that you're worried about. If it DID exist, how is it that life managed to survive the natural carbon dioxide fluxuations that have occurred throughout paleolontological history? What we're presented as cause for concern is based on computer models, and there are actually quite a few of them. Those involved with the IPCC have been using one with the same variable weights now for decades. These were the ones which, when Gore made his movie, "An Inconvenient Truth," were predicting human extinction by 2010 to 2015. Obviously, that hasn't happened. Those same models are now being used by folks like Alexandria Ocasio Cortez to frighten us into supporting the "Green New Deal" (which, by the way, even her colleagues in Congress won't support). There has been only one model that has made predictions which have proven accurate over the past twenty, twenty five years; a German model that is currently predicting only the most minimal impact, and almost all of it positive, for the next century. I understand why you think I'm either ignorant or a fool; fear can do that, and for years now, when this subject is brought up, fearmongering has been a staple of its proponents. The same was true back in the eighties, when I was doing College work on the subject of Global Cooling. It was widely held at that time that Sulphur Particulates would increase the Earth Albedo and trigger a new ice age. Meanwhile in addition to snow covering most of Earth for most of the year, these same particulates would mix with rain water and form acid rain.

You should be embarrassed but of course, you won't be, because you do not know ALL that you do not know! ! We are not talking about local weather and those temperature changes. ..which are a tiny part of CLIMATE the long term trends world wide, in this case. . We are not talking about Al Gore or that fiction about his grade average in science. Gore is a failed politician and a very successful Venture Capitalist. . 1. If were to go back in history about 2C....we would be under a mile of ICE over Manhattan. Climate: a global temperature change of two or three degrees C is a huge deal. 2. In geological history, a rapid natural temperature change was an average of 1C per 7,500 years. Human Activities/Industries have forced Atmospheric gasses to raise temps about 1C in 100 yrs. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1. CO2 has beneficially enabled life on Earth. (holding infra-red heat/warming the planet so life may proliferate)(has some fertilizer effect) (without CO2 + other Green House gases, Earth would be a Cold ROCK 0 degrees F.) . This is the story of a little is terrific and a lot is deadly...take Aspirin, for example. The Goldi Locks Level for humans of atmospheric CO2 has always been between 180ppm & 290ppm! For every Year a human has walked on Earth (hundreds of thousands of them) CO2 & other Gasses have ALWAYS been between 180ppm and 290ppm. Our Entire Physiology is BUILT UPON THOSE NUMBERS 180ppm and 290ppm. Today, we have increased those gas levels to 412ppm. We have NO idea what the long term effects will be on our grand children. 2. CO2 has boosted plant life on Earth BUT . Coincidentially, as CO2 levels have increased, Nutrient values have FALLEN at a Faster Rate ! . LESS iron LESS protein LESS Zinc Less Copper etc. etc. . IN all of the Staple Grains that the world has become dependent upon ! So you see, CO2 has some current benefits & some immediate challenges to human well being ! . https://www.natureworldnews.com/articles/15166/20150615/climate-change-plants-choke-much-carbon.htm . 3. CO2 Kills! . CO2 is a pollutant. We EXHALE to dispose of this poisonous waste product, like pee and poop! It kills, since it IS a poison It kills, since it IS an Asphyxiant (heavier than air, it smothers life) . (the higher the level of CO2, the lower the level of Oxygen) . EVERY LARGE Building requires Fresh Air Recirculation Sytems to fight the VERY HARMFUL effects of CO2 settling in basements and SEALED ROOMS. AS CO2 atmospheric levels increase so does the THREAT of CO2 in basements, sealed rooms and protected valleys and glades. * "Police: Carbon dioxide led to death in McDonald's bathroom September 14, 2011 1:38 p.m. EDT STORY HIGHLIGHTS: The carbon dioxide built up to toxic levels in the bathroom An 80-year-old woman died after the incident September 7, lethal dose of carbon dioxide, authorities said Wednesday...." * CO2 is heavier than air, so the concentration near the floor will be much higher," as well as protected glades, basements and sealed rooms. . "Higher Concentrations of CO2 in the Atmosphere increases incidents of threatening concentrations at ground levels and basements..." * * "One person, recounting the fate of eight men and one woman who walked into a basement area where the gas had accumulated, said they “fell down DEAD as if they had been shot.” * EVERY large building on EARTH has Fresh Air Re-circulation Systems in order to fight off effects of CO2 build up...the higher concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere, increases the threat from CO2 build up in buildings, basements and protected glades."

Ugw1ATL-fBKUTtCRW9d4AaABAg.8jrzcfs4gpd8t3qW8TIeyM		0	2019-03-29 16:32:01	Jeff Anderson	Respectfully, Rick, you have bad information. 1C worth of temperature change is laughable; anyone who's actually studied how biology and environment interact ought to tell you that no place on Earth, not even the tropical bands, have that little temperature variation over the course of a year. As to why environmental politicians claim it'll cause a die-off, I can best explain with a hypothetical. We have to assume (a dangerous word) that it starts with a good rain one year. Plants grow well and there's a good rate of birth among herbivores, leading to their predators doing well. Next year, there can be a glut of predators that have a larger than normal impact on "More Normal" herbivore populations, which leads to fewer herbivores surviving to next year, then the predators suffer starvation and the mass die-off, possibly pushing their population into numbers where inbreeding has a negative impact on them. Sound reasonable? Yes and no. Truth is, it assumes a great deal; good year worth of rain MUST be followed by a severe drought for the next two years. Predator population MUST pre-exist at a genetically critical point. What's more, the worst possible outcomes HAVE to occur. Only then will this disaster occur. Would you dictate national policy that cripples your national economy based on Murphy's Law? I sure wouldn't, but it is something that folks like Al Gore promote... The same Al Gore who failed in his attempt to sue his way into the White House in 2000, BEFORE he went on his rampage promoting Climate Change and how we have to restructure the entire economy of the United States because of it, and who also got a low D grade in the biology class he took in College. Sorry. I have to listen to scientists, not politicians. Also, you mentioned Greenhouses in your post; you called them expensive and impractical for growing enough food to feed everybody. You might wish to look into a place called the Mare de Plastico, in southern Spain; it's an immense greenhouse facility (one of, if not THE largest in the world).

I once priced the cost for solar panels on my house, and of course battery back ups, or tapping into the electric grid for the cloudy days and nights (never even considered the cost for a generator back up into the equation). It totally wasn't worth the costs! I was in my late 40's or around 50 when I inquired and when compared to my monthly electric bill to the total cost of products and installation, by the the time I would have reached the break even point, I might be dead from old age! And on top of that, like most Americans, I would of had to take out a loan to pay for it because, like most Americans, we just don't have 25,000 or more in pocket change to pay for it. Which means, with the loan plus all the interest payments, there is a very good chance I would never even see one penny of profit from going green.

Well, first dit they poll all the scientists? Who were those scientists? Where did those scientists live, San Francisco or Michigan? In fact, the scientists that were polled were climate scientists. Does that prove the point or does it show that they would lose their jobs if they were to buck the trend? "On his Twitter account, President Obama tweets: “Ninety-seven percent of scientists agree: #climate change is real, man-made and dangerous.” Not only does Obama sloppily equate “scientists” with “climate scientists,” but more importantly he added “dangerous” to the 97% claim, which is not there in the literature.

The Only Mathematically effective and sustainable solution is to reduce Human Population or stop the increase at the very least !!! But this is never said in the Media for some reason !! When responsible smart European people started having less children the Media told them this is a Mistake ?!! Why ?!! What the hell is wrong when a country population goes from 80M to 50M over 20 years ?!! isn't this better for the planet and for the resources consumption ?!! No we are told that this is bad and we need immigrants from 3rd world high birth rate countries !! Why ?! to have younger population to pay pension for the old !?!! But Where are all the money old people paid all their live in social security ?! Sorry the governments spent it. And how would importing 3rd world immigrants who mostly do not work and live on Gov welfare, how this will help ?! Do not ask or you will be called racist. Earth Population rapid increase is a huge problem on the long run, but no one is scaring the shit out of people about it now !! Which makes me doubt all of the scaring about other issues is selective to further a political Agenda.

The first reply, polar opposite! The amount of material mined in order to produce ore for all precious metals is overshadowed compared to retrieving oil & gas. Remember oil was drilled once upon a time with wooden derricks. Metals were removed from mountains and thus mountains were removed to vast pits, massive changes in landscapes took place. They both have their ups and downs but oil and gas is an easier process to accomplish. If you really want to stop the big worry of "oh my god we're changing the climate", just take the one element off the periodic table. The Human element. No people no worries and most of all... No Bitching. We're here, we multiply, we consume, we devour, we destroy! It will not stop until we stop our cycle. The only way to stop our cycle is to go extinct.

Electric cars are not heavier, they dont have to carry gas combusting engines. Also the electricity that they use that is produced by burning fuel and coal is produced much more efficiently by the plants that produce it. To have each individual car have to carry around the very machine that converts the fuel to energy is asinine an inefficient. Yes electric cars are not perfect but they are better and you should probably get used to it. First of all they are bad ass, out here in California they are everywhere and there are charging stations everywhere. In 20 years it will be an oddity to see someone in a gas car. There is no one solution to climate change. It will be lots of things. People used to think cars would never replace the horse and buggy.

The plastic drinking straw issue is directed at mitigating their impact on sea creatures! And you claim that electric cars are not greener (than internal combustion engine powered ones). Please provide relevant citations from peer-reviewed literature then. Of course they are. There are no carbon emissions from electric cars, and the energy used to power them can and will increasingly come from renewable sources like solar, wind, geothermal, hydroelectric, etc. Also, worst case, even if the power for electric cars came from the burning of fossil fuels they would still be better than the multitude of individual internal combustion cars because the source of power is more centralized so the power plant can be made increasingly efficient compared to the population of individual carbon-spewing engines.

Because electric motors have very few moving parts and electric vehicles have no transmission so they may be inherently more reliable than gasoline cars. Also, electric cars are in their infancy. They will become only more reliable and less expensive to repair when the technology grows. Another point. An electric car that charges from solar power produces virtually no greenhouse gasses. You can charge from your own solar panels or from the city or town you live in. But lets assume you are charging from other power plants, including coal. To calculate the upstream green house gasses from charging on "the grid" you can go to this website: https://www.fueleconomy.gov/. I calculated the greenhouse gasses produced by charging an electric car in Michigan and it is less than the greenhouse gasses produced by the average gasoline vehicle. In fact charging an electric car in Michigan produces 63% of the greenhouse gasses of the average new gasoline vehicle. And as the energy suppliers become "greener" so will the cars. Your gasoline car will not become greener. You will have to buy newer gasoline cars with greater fuel efficiency to become "greener". "the point is that the carbon footprint your car made to be manufactured far exceeds any savings in carbon efficiency that you think you made." The carbon created by manufacturing batteries for electric vehicles can be RECOUPED in less than 3 years by the carbon you would save by driving the electric car rather than a gasoline powered car! https://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/hybrid-electric/news/a27039/tesla-battery-emissions-study-fake-news/	UCXEo1GWLAF-WNxvvPV9BXkQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXEo1GWLAF-WNxvvPV9BXkQ	1	Ugw1ATL-fBKUTtCRW9d4AaABAg	Unmannedair

Solar, wind, and tidal at least probably have their place. However, ALL such forms of power production result in many orders of magnitude more waste than say a nuclear power plant. China BTW is building both nuclear and fossil plants as fast as they can. Yes batteries can be made quite literally from thousands of different substances. That is not the issue. The biggest issue is energy storage capacity verses size and weight. The Li battery is a huge improvement in that area but is also both somewhat dangerous and a very significant source of hazardous waste. The NiFe (pronounce nie-faugh) battery is probably the least polluting. Some fuel cells are pretty good from a pollution standpoint too because of their long lifetime. Electric vehicles undoubtedly have their place, and they do reduce local air pollution but overall they are still a wash. As for wind and solar, storage for 'slack' times is still way beyond practical so it is necessary to have standby fossil generation facilities. The only practical fossil facilities for such use is gas turbines but even those have to be on the grid to be useful which means that they are running at a very low fuel efficiency.

What that means is that it takes the same amount of energy to propel a given automobile a given distance, all other things being equal - with electricity or gas. Electricity is generated with oil and coal. Alternatives like wind are not practical and nobody's going to change a nationwide infrastructure to cater to a few Teslas, so that part of your argument goes out the window. Electric cars require huge batteries which are made of rare metals and acids - how green is that? How much (coal & gas fired) energy does it take to make them - and then recycle them when they go dead? Next is efficiency, and here you can do all the arithmetic. Internal combustion engines are less efficient than electric motors but they only require petroleum byproducts to run. Electric motors require electricity which is generated by burning coal and oil. Since batteries are very heavy, an electric car is heavier, which weighs on the overall efficiency. When you add the whole thing up, internal combustion cars are greener and cheaper. The ultimate answer will lie in a different technology, like hydrogen fuel cells or some such. In the meantime, it's "you're wrong", not "your wrong".

Here they tried to accomplish green energy expansion by mandating green electrical production on the electric companies, subsidizing companies that produce green energy generating products (which led to the Solyndra debacle) and providing "incentives" for consumers which was either A. Buy it yourself (no subsidies), or B. Let one of the electric companies install it on your roof, lease it from them, and reduce your bill by dollars generated minus lease cost. Very few did the first and the ones who did the second ended up screwed when electric companies started playing games with local and state regulations (of course). Many people who leased are having difficulty selling their houses as buyers don't want to inherit the solar leases. All in all it was a borderline failure.

Now it's only typically 12 cents. The cost is 33 cents. However, the cost of panels dropped 80% between 1998 and 2013, and by a further 55% between 2013 and 2017. The subsidies are ramping down as a result of that. When they halve again, there will be no feed-in tariff. We had friends who paid over $22,000 for a 5 kW system in the early 2000's. It was going to take 8 years to break even. We paid $6000 for a 6 kW system that will take 3 years to break even. That break-even time will continue to shorten, even as subsidies go to zero.

I'd wager a guess that the cost for solar skyrockets again leaving those with solar panels deriving all of the benefit provided by those who footed the bill for the subsidy, unless those that benefitted from the subsidy are forced to put the electricity from 'their' panels back into the grid. That's typically how subsidies work here in the US (e.g. I got mine mentality). I'm curious if it's any different there.

First, they are way more efficient, even when considering the long tail pipe argument that you and others are making here. Also, the grid is getting greener every year (more and more wind and solar coming on line), which helps reduce emissions from both transport and manufacturing. Issues from mining and other environmental impacts are real, but they are not inherent to electric cars (or other green technologies). That is the biggest difference with using oil and other fossil fuels, which will never be sustainable because of CO2 emissions. CO2 is just a very tough byproduct to eliminate. It is chemically very stable, and remains in equilibrium between the atmosphere and the oceans for a very long time (hundred of years), before it eventually gets weatherized (absorbed in soil or minerals).

What should alarm us all is the rate at which global temperatures change and climate zones are shifting. From an environmental standpoint, ecosystems are not able to adapt. The loss of biodiversity is already on a pace that rivals past mass extinction events (this would be the 6th one, and scientists have already dubbed our era the "Anthropocene"). Year to year changes may not seem so bad, unless we evaluate them on a geological timescale, in which case they are catastrophic. As far as humans are concerned, assuming our capacity to grow food remains unaffected (a big "if"), regional impacts will increasingly force people to move to more hospitable places, with all the conflicts that you can imagine such migrations will create (it's starting to happen in Europe).

Have you thought for a moment how the electricity is generated to charge those batteries? With the majority of electricity in the US being generated by natural gas (32%), coal (30%), nuclear (20%) and hydropower (7%), wind (6%), biomass (2%) or solar(1%), you can see why that plugging in a vast amount of those cars will increase demand for more electricity and it's generation as already outlined. And don't get me started about the lack of battery recycling which only currently stands at about a 3% recovery rate.

As such, I do find myself belittled as uninformed on many aspects of science. If I may, though, I'd still like to put forth some thoughts I've had on the subject... First, I know that a lot of food is grown in greenhouses. If the world is facing food shortages and famines, doesn't it make more sense to, well, for lack of a better phrase, "Go Greenhouse?" Second, I've heard a lot about biodiversity and the need to protect Coral Reefs and Tropical Rain Forests. Aren't the tropics the hottest average band on Earth, and doesn't a warmer Earth mean a broader tropical zone? Third, I remember hearing in science classes that evolution tends towards pushing life towards giantism when food is in good supply and dwarfism when food is less plentiful. We also hear about the giant sauropods of the Jurassic, which walked the Earth in HERDS. Doesn't that mean that, there had to be plenty of plant stuff for them to eat, and if we do "Go Greenhouse," we'll be able to grow more food for US? Fourth, I hear about our changing climate making storms worse, but as John pointed out in the video, more people die from cold related problems than heat problems. Also, how often do newscasters talk about a "Winter Storm paralyzing the Midwest/Northeast" versus how often do they headline "Summer Storm paralyzes Midwest/Northeast?"

By supply my entire home, i mean all of it, heating, and cooling, which can be extreme some years because i live in Iowa, and all the necessities of a modern home. I don't want to hear an assessment of "this panel provides X, so you will get Y amount of power for your home" because that doesn't take into consideration, dense cloud cover, or being covered in snow all day while my wife and i are working, which would require a deep cycle battery system with enough power storage capabilities to keep my heat running all day in the case of heavy snow fall. While you're at it i wouldn't mind a simple base model of the Tesla 3 for $35k and another $12k every 8 years for a new battery(which is lithium, not a filthy 5 gallon bucket of salt water that produces a short term 0.8V charge lol) i will foot the bill for any other repairs on it of course my good sir or madam.. this of course is all satire (except the saltwater battery) because i am of a libertarian mindset and not terribly fond of people expecting handouts.. obviously converting to greener forms of energy is good, we for sure agree 100% on that issue. however, for me not because i believe that our carbon emissions cause climate change, but because i feel that humans and animals alike deserve fresh air to breath. I really didn't understand your comment about "going the way of china" they have over twice the us carbon footprint, and also have major smog problems due to massive population density.. At any rate, the point i am trying to make is, being green is very expensive, and many people simply cant afford the upfront costs of converting to mostly green homes, and transportation.

The solar panels require mining heavy metals for doping the silica crystals. The rubber on your tires still comes from petroleum, and if you don't have solar, then the energy for your car likely comes from some kind of petrol or coal. (Natural gas is still a petroleum product). The plastic that forms the bulk of the fiberglass is a toxic resin made from petroleum products. The wire insulation is a petrol derivative. The infrastructure for electric is all maintained by petrol products. The steel furnaces are run from natural gas. The massive amount of energy required to refine the aluminum in the car comes from the electric grid and likely is running of petrol. The dyes in the vinyl seats and dash are petrol products and the vinyl itself. The batteries require lithium which must be mined, and likely uses diesel mining equipment. Or in the event of hydraulic mining uses natural gas to remove the excess water from the lithium sludge. Then there is the metal, and plastic used to make the battery cases. Petrol products. TL;DR the point is that the carbon footprint your car made to be manufactured far exceeds any savings in carbon efficiency that you think you made. A far smaller footprint would be to fix and improve the vehicles we already have. I love everything electric, but most of what you just said is pure propaganda. Also, all those batteries have a 7 year average lifespan before needing replacement. The electronics in the car, heavy metals, also probably will need replacement in about 10 years or less depending on care.

First they have to drill for it (which sometimes results in leakages), then they have to contain it ship it in huge shipping containers, refine it, then truck it long distances (a heck of a lot of diesel and pollution used in this stage), before it winds up at the local pump. As opposed to a electric car, which people can charge from home and which costs far less in fuel costs!!! What do you prefer, going to the fuel pump and paying $50.00 each fill up or charging from home for nothing , if you have solar panels as I do???!!!

In this case the models are the hypothesis&#39;, (or law as Feynman describes them) and the actual temperature measurements, some of which are satellites, represent the empirical measurements.<br /><br />&lt;b&gt; Therefore it is very obvious that the models fall under Feynman&#39;s rejection. There is therefore no scientific evidence that the earth is warming, (or cooling), other than what has already been observed throughout history.&lt;/b&gt;<br /><br />Unfortunately, governments like excuses to issue new laws. As most governments nowadays, (including that of New Zealand), are sliding steadily to the left, this gives them an excuse to issue more laws and regulations of the sort which we must obey at the cost of trading a little of our freedom and democracy. We see this happening in our society at this very moment as common law is replaced with regulative legislation in most sectors. Common law traditionally is/was at arms length from governments. Regulations by legislation are not.<br /><br />So please take the time to study these things. If you are a skeptic, (and so should everyone), please use the facts above if you are challenged by some greenie.<br /><br />This is how science works and the above is the correct scientific conclusion.<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />Roger	UCqY7oBDQRrspmCWtAofhC-A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqY7oBDQRrspmCWtAofhC-A	0

Were all the nights jousting with Harleys, and king's courts transporting themselves in hummers? What caused that warm period? Was that warm period the end of human civilization? No, it was a boon to the people who were coming out of a cool period known as the dark ages. Over the past 13,000 years, the Great Salt Lake has had multiple dry/wet periods, and overall the volume of this lake has been decreasing over time. So, over that past 13,000 years, how much of that time period has been influenced by humans? Really only about 300 years, but it is doubtful that the industrial revolution really emitted that much CO2, so we could really actually say that humans have had an effect over the past 100 years, if that.

Will John Stossel and all of you deniers pay for the damage that will be caused by Climate Change? Of course not. Just enjoy the benefits and let the others pay the negative externalities.

The issue is the cause man or natural. So far no one has proven it to be due to man&#39;s CO2. Most who make that claim confuse cause with effect or simply assume that it must be man. Or we have considered all possible caused, leaving man&#39;s CO2 as the culprit. Of course there is no way to be sure they really know all possible causes.

Very effective in controlling almost all very easily. Science today, as it has ALWAYS been, is corrupt. A very few undisputed universal discoveries and actual truths (gravity, laws of physics, etc) sprinkled in with &quot;ideas&quot; made almost law by fame and fortune seeking &quot;scientists&quot;. Especially if those &quot;scientists&quot; work for a big company or university, which by the way they all do. Money is always the root of not only evil, but motivation in general. Everyone can be bought, and in some respect, IS bought. Modern Medicine came about exactly this way. Rockefeller and Crarnagie extorted the natural healing schools of the time to play along or theyd be shut down. The ones who took the deal are the ones that are &quot;revered&quot; today. Johns Hopkins, Harvard med., etc... This should be common knowledge, however, the scum soul selling institutes are praised because the truth gets buried. Thanks again leftist, corrupt bought and paid for media!! This crap is as old as time itself, every few years another &quot;urgent&quot; humanitarian crisis arises that seems to only be able to be fixed by increasing taxes. Funny how fleecing citizens is ALWAYS the cure for what ails humanity. These politicians are so skillful at communicating lies it is truly frightening. These minds are the most dangerous as they hide behind non threatening, calming, seemingly caring and intelligent facades, seducing and luring in all who gaze upon them.

Refusing to believe what's happening to the world around you may be how you deal with life but, as with our ancestors, ignoring threats is detrimental to our lives. Though, at this point, humans need a massive mandate to tackle the challenges ahead. Fortunately, people like you are a very small minority. Unfortunately, we have leaders that are incapable, incompetent, or unwilling to do what it will take. Some time, in the near future, you may actually wake up to reality because it will be affecting your life in a much bigger way.

Higher temperature around the tropics = more moisture evaporated from the oceans producing much warmer denser and increased cloud production (hence more flooding in tropics where tree cover is reduced).....then more and denser ‘tropical rainforest clouds’ carrying more moisture escape the tropics as intense heat on cleared land creates lift to allow these clouds to escape the tropics on trade winds...hence cooling effect away from the tropics as cloud cover increases and increased rain and snow fall away from the tropics, whilst extra cloud cover also traps the extra heat travelling up from the tropics.....Less trees in the tropics each year = less biomass to sequester the CO2’....As the ocean warms, the warmer seas travel north to the Arctic and south to the Antarctic...as warmer air from the tropics travels north and south.... air is warmer in the Arctic and in the Antarctic....simples!’ The warmer air and seas distorts the position of the jet stream pushing it north towards west Canada and north towards the UK but there is a counteractive force pushing the jet stream south at these points as a result of the increase in cloud cover escaping the Tropics which cools some areas of the ocean through reduced radiation from the sun. <br /> <br />The world&#39;s governments and the world media are failing the common man. With so many suffering from fires, floods, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, many loose their critical documents...birth and marriage certificates, insurance documents, driving licences and passports. Without these documents it is very difficult, time consuming and expensive to replace these documents. The governments and the media should at very least warn everyone to keep these documents safe and high in their homes!!!

Then, they blame their alleged archenemies, patriarchy/capitalism/whites, for the problems they chose to ignore.<br /><br />The totalitarian socialist states of the twentieth century employed the same strategy. The NAZIs argued the apocalypse of the Germanic people, and claimed that everyone was conspiring to oppress them. The Communist Russians argued their survival depended on social re-engineering: the five-year plan, and claimed that the fascists and nationalists were existential threats. There are many other examples. Eric Blair&#39;s Animal Farm is a fairy tale of this pattern in modern politics and history. The West is in the Old Major chapters right now. I doubt we have learned anything. My generation, the millennials, are the most dogmatic, historically illiterate generation in American history, and our parent&#39;s generation let us be indoctrinated by state schools. There is essentially little hope that we will avoid the Snowball Revolution.<br /><br />Short lesson in semantics: public vs state schools.<br /><br />Public is a word we use for state-controlled institutions in a politically plural state. State is a word we use for state-controlled institutions in a one-party state. In both cases, institutions not controlled privately are controlled by the state, with some distinction in autonomy.<br /><br />Our public institutions are overwhelming populated by constituents of one party. That same party is hellbent on pigeonholing all objectionable opposition into the narrative of the evil Republican party. Interesting enough, the Star Wars chronology has Lord Vader and the Emperor characterize the Republic as evil to justify one-party rule. The parallels are scary if you think critically. Beware the salvific message offered by Snowball and Napoleon. They&#39;re anti-Christs inducing mass delusion via mythological vision. The dreams of socialism are the true opiates of the masses.

Canada and Russia will have warmer and more areable land freed from ice and permafrost. Citizens of south Asia and Pacific island will have to leave sinking island and will take citizenship in Canada, Europe or Russia. Demographic will change. Will you accept so many immigrants?

On top of the Little Ice Age...A solar event called the Maunder Minimum...which made that century even colder. http://www.realclimate.org/images//Marcott.png This Inter Glacial Period Reached its peak temperatures around 7500-8000 years ago. In spits and spurts, temperatures have been falling as we headed toward the next Glaciation (ice age). . Brief warm events are remembered, not because they were SOO warm...but because they were such a relief from the cold. (...Medieval Warming, Roman Warming, Minoan Warming....All limited geographically but welcomed from the cold). . What has FOCUSED SCIENCE on Global Warming/Climate Change is the fact that Earth's most powerful cycle ( GLACIATION ) was STOPPED so abruptly. . ALL the causes of Glaciation continue to this Day ! Earth's orbit is pulling us away from the sun. Earth's Axis is tilted away from the sun. Earth's Wobble is conducive to Glaciation. . In addition, over the last 50 years, we have been in a solar minimum ... where solar output has been reduced......YET TEMPS ARE RISING and that rise is ACCELERATING.

Earth's most powerful natural cycles are triggered by Milankovitch Cycles.... Basically Earth's elliptical orbit around the sun at its furthest point and Earth's Axis is tilted away from the sun is the depth of the Glaciations (ice age). When these two begin their return trip...starts a very slow warming trend, the warming oceans release vast quantities of Water Vapor &CO2 Stored...and H2O/CO2 & other greenhouse gasses then do their thing... interfering with EARTH EMISSIONS of Infra Red Thermal Radiation toward space...the more thermal radiation that remains on earth...the warmer it gets. . This Era is the Holocene Inter Glacial Warm period. It began at the end of the last Glaciation, it PEAKED in temperatures about 7500-8000 years ago. Temperatures have slowly been Falling in accordance with our natural Cycles. Tens of thousands of years from now we would normally enter another glaciation. Much of the last 1000 years is actually called the LITTLE ICE AGE...because of the chilly temps. "LITTLE" because it ended abruptly. . Suddenly in the late 1700's, Temps leveled out and started to warm again, unnaturally counter to the well known cycles. Look for yourself: http://www.realclimate.org/images//Marcott.png . WHAT INTERRUPTED EARTH'S most powerful natural cycle? Since then, temperatures have been rising for OVER 2 CENTURIES! . (Thomas Jefferson and John Adams discussed this notable change.) Equally important is the FACT that Our Sun's " Energy Output " has DECREASED a bit over the last 50 years...all the while these temperatures have been rising. . Look for yourself: . Solar Energy Decreases, YET Global Warming Increases, more rapidly. https://static.skepticalscience.com/pics/TvsTSI.png .. THE EARTH SHOULD BE ' COOLING ' and ' COOLING ' DRAMATICALLY ! . NOW that is why CLIMATE CHANGE was 1st talked about, by Alexander von Humboldt in 1799 and by Thomas Jefferson. By 1811, science had tied these changes to Human Activities. By 1956, Foote Tied these climate changes to the Effect Earth's Atmospheric Gasses have on Sunlight. In 1896, the first explanation of Climate Change was attributed to Global Warming. In the 1970's, A-Political Satellite Technology started to cement GLOBAL WARMING and GREENHOUSE GASSES.

For example: A Russian lawyer met with Trump’s family members and campaign staff to discussion providing “dirt” on Hillary Clinton in June 2016. ------>As a part of the meeting the team discussed potential sanctions relief, a major Kremlin priority. The email that led to the meeting specified that the Russian government was actively working to help Trump’s campaign. This meeting was later kept a secret by all parties until it was uncovered by reporters. . ------->Donald Trump Jr., who set up the meeting, publicly denied that Russia was helping his father even after admitting setting up the Trump Tower Meeting, 1 floor above his father's suite. The lie was mutually beneficial to the Trump campaign and to Russian efforts to interfere in the campaign. . "Roger Stone is publicly accused by Mueller of lying to Congress about his attempts to coordinate with both the Trump campaign and with WikiLeaks, believed to be a conduit for Russian information warfare, regarding hacked campaign emails. ((( STONE is being hauled into court again, after POSTING A SEVERELY THREATENING TWEET about the JUDGE in his case. ))) ------>Mueller’s indictment contains compelling evidence that Stone lied. . "Michael Cohen has admitted to lying to Congress about the extent and duration of negotiations on Trump’s behalf to build a Trump Tower Moscow during the 2016 campaign. Again, ------>this included multiple, ongoing lies from both Trump’s team and the Kremlin — a cohesive set of lies that served both sets of interest. . "Trump publicly called on Russia to find Clinton’s emails — and, according to Mueller, -------->Russian hackers tried to hack her emails that same day. . "Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn lied to the FBI about his talks with the Russian ambassador about sanctions during the transition. . "Paul Manafort, Trump’s ex-campaign manager, gave polling data to Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian political consultant believed to have ties to Russian intelligence, during the campaign, as Mueller’s investigation has revealed. . "Manafort has also pleaded guilty to conspiring with Kilimnik in 2018 to tamper with witnesses to protect themselves from the Russia investigation. --------->"Manafort also admitted to conspiring with Kilimnik to violate the Foreign Agents Registration Act and to launder money from Ukraine. .

Psychology is a science, a relatively recent and still not well understood one, but science nonetheless. And science we KNOW of tells that having the gender you identify with regardless of physique helps being a balanced individual. If anything it is conservative who only want to hear the facts they want. like the fact that while climate is always changing, today it change at a record speed not seen since the last extinction event. It change too fast for lifeforms to adapt through evolution, too fast for even whole human populations to adapt , especially in poor country. The fact that this change have anthropogenic souces, and the fact that it will be very bad. Projections are based on science. We can predict the effects of this change with a simulation like we can predict the air flow on a wing with another simulation. The question of climate change IS settled. It IS happening (97% peer-rewiewed reasearch affirm it), it is our fault (86%) and it WILL be a catastrophe (89%) if nothing is done. The only thing left to debate is how bad it will be and what can be done about it.

Unfortunately the post modernist progressive crazies have decided the only fact, the only truth that exists is that everything is relative and due to social constructs, even evolution. They don’t even seem to recognize the irony of that statement. They have chosen to remove fact from science. Genetics is a science. Gender is binary, based on fact. Doctors are supposed to be people of science. Any doctor who goes along with the idea that gender is “assigned” at birth is choosing his or her career and social standing over truth, not to mention the well-being of the patient. As for climate change...climate always has, and always, will change. Anthropogenic climate change is a religion. That climate always changes is a scientific fact. Anthropogenic climate change is a Gaia centered religion. It is not based on fact. It is based on faith in projections. Projection is just that, a projection. Projections are not facts. Those projections are based on models created by people. Garbage in, garbage out. The fact that our former president called anthropogenic climate change “settled science” is appalling. Science is never settled.	UCwgsTKOc3cpSOBXg7x_NSDw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwgsTKOc3cpSOBXg7x_NSDw	1	Ugx_OAB2zgSwJvyf1rV4AaABAg	Walking Journey

It has two main sources of energy- light, and potential energy from infalling material. It has one main source of matter- infalling material. The earth emits energy in the form of light, and loses matter due to radioactive decay, scouring by the solar wind, and space exploration.<br /><br />Within that framework everything must make sense.<br /><br />So if we are ignoring the sunlight falling on the surface of the Earth, and we are burning coal like villains we are using more energy than we are recieving. Because the Earth is an approximate sphere its volume is finite therefore you can conclude that we will run out of energy. I am comfortable with that not being contentious and it also somehow motivates me to think about things bigger. It also let&#39;s me recognize that at it&#39;s fundamental, wind energy actually IS solar energy. And fossil fuels actually ARE solar energy. Geothermal is likely not solar but instead leftover kinetic energy and leftover radioactive energy. See, John Baez helped me be smarter!<br /><br />Fox News doesn&#39;t...

UgyQQX2ejFSS28I5cmh4AaABAg	5	0	2018-05-18 02:50:14	EF M	CO2 is a greenhouse gas. That is it both absorbs and releases infrared photons. Once released, there is one chance in 23,600 that infrared photon will continue within one degree in the same direction. This basically gives that photon a 50/50 chance of going either up or down. Since the oceans cover about 70% of the Earth, this gives that photon about a 35% chance of hitting a body of water. Infrared photons will not penetrate the surface, instead will excite an H2O molecule causing evaporation. H2O is the primary greenhouse gas which prevents the Earth from having a climate like our moon. Consequently the more CO2 we put into the atmosphere, the more H2O gets into the atmosphere, the warmer the planet gets. This is how a 40% increase in CO2 caused a 7% increase in absolute humidity. The present increase in temperature due to this CO2 function is approximately .9C at present. Because it takes a tremendous amount of time for the oceans to heat, it will take centuries for the Earth to reach temperature equilibrium. If we continue to inject CO2 into the atmosphere, that heating process will continue to accelerate.	UCU3EvuNPCpCXcnkJyF2fcvA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU3EvuNPCpCXcnkJyF2fcvA	0

CO2 is like pins in a pinball machine. The more pins, CO2 molecules, the more bouncing around you get. Then the infrared photons are absorbed by H2O molecules causing evaporation, which causes even more pins in that pinball machine. That is what slows the balls, infrared photons, from escaping into the stratosphere and eventually into outer space, cooling the planet. Infrared photons are a very small part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Consequently, on entrance, the amount of the electromagnetic spectrum that is blocked by CO2 and H2O is also very small. It is the amount of the electromagnetic spectrum on the entrance that is absorbed, converted and released into the infrared spectrum that is being blocked by the additional CO2 and H2O on the exit of the planet that is making the difference. The planet is clearly heating and for a reason. With a cooling Sun, there has to be an additional factor in the climate equation. CO2 has very specific properties that are widely understood. I'm only giving a very simplified analogy that can be easily understood by the general population.

This led to much more realistic simulations and enabled the results to be explained in terms of processes which could be observed in the real world. Manabe and Wetherald made a number of other discoveries. First, that the temperature of the stratosphere cooled markedly when carbon dioxide was doubled. This is the characteristic “fingerprint” of increasing carbon dioxide: the troposphere warms and the stratosphere cools, as we have observed over the last 50 years.

I do know enough about how global warming and economics work to say that the approach of attempting to decrease carbon emmisions will not solve the global problem. The only way you can fix the fundamental cause is to leverage environmental mechanisms to accelerate deposition rather than restrict release. This is achievable with relatively little spending, especially if a private sector incentive method is used rather than creating a new government service. The industry whom it would benefit greatly to participate is...da dada daaa COMMERCIAL FISHING!	UCzWgzzfb3dHVTOuqagO8IRg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzWgzzfb3dHVTOuqagO8IRg	0

Nothing the planet hasn&#39;t been through before. Hell, there may be some new islands created due to rising levels. Conversely, the Great Lakes may dry up completely.

Only problem is that as the ocean heats up more ocean life dies, but it&#39;s mostly corals and other creatures i don&#39;t really care about. The important part is that when ocean creatures die the rotting process releases a bunch of gasses which end up locked in the bottom of the ocean. If I&#39;m remembering correctly there&#39;s a bunch of methane down there and if the ocean heats up then all that gas will come up and really mess with the atmosphere. We&#39;ll likely drain out that gas and use it before that, but it&#39;s still an eventuality. Everyone always bashes on environmentalist, but if it wasn&#39;t for them then we&#39;ll still be driving with lead based gasoline since apparently it gives better efficiency	UCgXxazeTJ_Z4ukWPhC9GxOw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgXxazeTJ_Z4ukWPhC9GxOw	0

Consider the crop yields, orchards, cattle, fisheries, in the entire food system, much of it is vulnerable. Granted there are at least 10 species on earth right now that would survive into the next age just due to how survivable their species are, few dozen would probably find a way also... While Humans still want to deny the possibility. Not saying it&#39;s going to happen, but like the condom.. Would you rather have one and not need one? Or need one and not have one?

The main problem is more energy being trapped in the atmosphere of earth period. We humans and a lot of the other life on earth have gotten used to the way the climate has been for quite some time. You say why change the way we live? That&#39;s exactly what people concerned about a climate shift are thinking too.<br /><br />I mean, you think eliminating coal, gas and oil in favour of hydro, nuclear, wind, solar or tidal is a horrible change. How about less food to go around because where it was good to grow food moves? Bigger energy bill to both heat and cool your home in more extreme seasons. Humans will probably survive a major climate shift, no doubt about that. But it wont be particularly fun.<br /><br />The reasonable scientists are not saying that humans are the only force behind climate change, but they are a factor. Switching over to electric cars and slapping some solar panels on your roof isn&#39;t going to cut it though. Both sides on the extremes of the climate issue distort and drown out reason on the matter with pure emotion and hyperbole.<br /><br />What we want to do to ensure comfort and out current way of living is to mitigate as much of the shifting climate as we can. Either by better capturing the emissions of greenhouse gasses (Which is everything from CO2 to Methane) Or replacing them with non-polluting sources. Ideally more hydro electric and nuclear. And wind/solar where it&#39;s viable. Moving over to EV&#39;s isn&#39;t even remotely a solution unless power generation that doesn&#39;t emit greenhouse gas is in place anyhow.<br /><br />But better than EVs, would be changing infrastructure to encourage people not to drive period. Better mass transit, less distance between work, necessities and housing. Not only does that serve to reduce greenhouse gases, but also smog and air pollution in cities. It also improves the economies of areas where everyone has access to transport to work and necessities.<br /><br />But I have no doubts whiny liberals and deniers will continue to drown out rational opinions and plans for the foreseeable future.

(there are loads of reasons for temperature changes but all have been checked of under scientific studies)<br />Each year the world produces green house gases and absorbs same gases. Until 1850ish this was more or less a 0% +/- thing.<br />Then something changed a little more gases were produced then absorbed. It seems like a tiny part even today it is not much each year. But like a bank account it increases with every year and slowly builds up. Now 170 years later almost 32% of the CO2 in the atmosphere is man made. We still add less then 1% each year but we are starting to see some effects.<br /> As I said there is no scientific arguments about this at all anywhere on earth not even USA. In politics there are in a few countrys in the third world and in, well the USA. That the US is all alone in the western world should raise some red flags but apparently people are just to dumb.

It&#39;s a question of unprecedented speed of warming. <br />And it&#39;s not a question of &quot;dangerous or not dangerous.&quot; It&#39;s a question of a gamut of profound, intense changes. Sea levels is one of the less concerning. More frightening is the food supply being threatened by drastic changes in what crops can be grown where; intensity and frequency of super storms; diseases spreading in ways they never could have before; etc., etc., etc. The list goes on.

After the graft is skimmed off the top, most of the money is to be redistributed to 3rd World Countries in the form of Green Energy Grants to build out environmentally friendly infrastructure. In fact it&#39;s to prop-up global Socialism. Get countries dependent on Carbon tax money to force compliance with Global Governance. Mao Zedong and Red China couldn&#39;t compete with free market capitalism so they switch their economic system away from Communism, however retained the Communist central leadership. watching the downfall of the USSR had much to do with it. Poverty lives in Communist Countries like Cuba and Venezuela, The Communists had to build an Iron Curtain across Europe to keep their best people in. The grass is greener on the other side of that Iron Curtain. To deal with this Marxists invented the Global Warming Lie. If the whole world is Communists there is no where better to escape to. Progressive is code for Marxist.	UCG8fCuIUNskoasKny-OKSJg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG8fCuIUNskoasKny-OKSJg	0

Air pollutant emissions, such as hydrocarbons, oxides of nitrogen and particulate matter can ... Fact: There is no practical necessity whatsoever, whereby it is a necessity for humankind to continue to make use of the primitive energy wasting method, of burning billions of tons of toxic air-polluting fossil fuels. In exchange for obtaining (distilling) the more concentrated neurological, neurogenic, and carcinogenic toxic elements of petroleum fuels, which are later invisibly released into the Earth’s atmosphere; to pollute mutate and to poison every living creature and thing on the planet. Regardless as to whether a person is a climate change sceptic or not, why would anyone wish to support billions of tons of neuro-toxic carcinogen hydrocarbons, being constantly vented into the atmosphere we all have to breathe. Over that of making using of the unlimited quantities of free natural energy, which could be quickly made available; if it were not for corrupt politicians and governments, acting at the behest of their Corporate masters rather than for the benefit of the people who elect them and they disingenuously claim to serve. Natural Sources of energy Wind Turbine – Solar – Hydro – Water Wave – Water Current - Geothermal – Composting - Sewage/Methane – Organic/Alcohol etc. Wind Turbines. Contrary to the views put forward by their critics, properly designed wind turbines are the major solution for generating unlimited amounts of electrical energy and scrubbing the atmosphere clear of excess Co2, GHG’s and hydrocarbon pollutants. Current vertical rotor wind turbines are noisy, inefficient, cause bird strikes, take up far too much ground space, are a blot on the landscape, kill birdlife, and are a health hazard due to their electromagnetic emissions, in sum they are primitive. Reference: Wind energy frequently asked questions (FAQ) | EWEA http://www.ewea.org/wind-energy-basics/faq/ Wind Turbine Size To Output Power: 7.5 MW turbines are the largest today with blades about 60 metres long – over half the length of a rotor diameter of over 120 metres – longer than a football field. 15 MW turbines are planned and 20 MW turbines are considered to be theoretically possible. At some time or another, all of us will have seen the rotating mill roof vents which are used to extract excess heat from our homes and factories. Unlike the single direction limited amounts of wind power gained from two or three rotor blade turbines, rotating mill vents have a complete all-around wind surface area of 360 degrees. Comparatively, relative to the diameter and height of the lateral rotating mill, this factor grants the lateral rotating mill the ability to gain many times the amount of wind force available, to that of vertical rotor turbines. Most importantly: Any number of lateral rotating mills could be stacked one over the other in multi-level wind towers, and if manufactured in prefabricated interlocking sections, they could be connected and erected to any desired height on site. Unlike vertical rotor wind towers which deliver the rotational power to a single elevated turbine. Multi-level lateral rotating mills would deliver their combined rotational power (torque) to a single central vertical drive shaft, which would descend into either a single powerful motor turbine below ground level, or to form a central hub of torque delivering its power in a cartwheel fashion to a surrounding circle of turbines. And as the turbines would be enclosed below ground level, electromagnetic emissions would not be a health risk as they as well as noise would be absorbed by the ground surrounding the turbines enclosure. Also unlike the vertical wind rotors on current wind turbines which cannot be enclosed, and kill birds. Lateral rotational mills can be entirely surrounded by mesh to prevent birds flying into the rotating mills. Wind Turbine Energy Efficiency Betz's law gives a maximum of 59% of the wind power exerted, as to be available for conversion into mechanical energy, via a conventional vertical wind turbine. All elevated wind turbines are subject to a gravitational and wind leverage effect, (yaw) which causes friction and reduces the efficiency within the turbines. Lateral rotating mills would suffer no such problem, as there is no gravitational or wind resistance factor to contend with, as rotating mills simply spin faster in high winds. However, as a means of allowing rotating mills to work at the highest level of performance in low wind strength locals, magnetic levitation rings could be incorporated into the towers, to eliminate any element’s of rotational friction. In Sum Given the national grid system, there is no reason why enough electricity could not be generated from multi-level rotational mill towers operating over an area of perhaps three to four square kilometres of ground space, to meet and to exceed the total electricity requirements of Australia. Global Sources of Heat The Earth’s radius is approximately 6,371 km and its surface area is approximately 510 million square kilometres (196,900,000 square miles) with an average of 1,000 watts of solar energy per square metre. + Trillions of kilowatts of heat released into rivers and oceans from the motors, and the heated toxic effluents from hundreds of millions of washing machines, dishwashers, showers, baths, and sewage from toilets, every year. + Billions of kilowatts of heat released from hundreds of millions of tons of curing construction concrete, and brick and ceramic kilns every year. + Billions of megawatts of heat released from the exhaust gases of billions of vehicles, trains, shipping, aircraft, NASA rockets, and the munitions of war every year. + Billions of kilowatts of wasted heat released into rivers oceans and atmosphere from Nuclear power stations every year. + Trillions of kilowatts of wasted heat released from burning billions of tons of coal to convert oil and bitumen into industrial and domestic oils, diesel kerosene, petroleum, petrochemicals, pesticides, herbicides etc. + Trillions of more kilowatts of wasted heat used to convert oil into plastic and mould it into billions of tons of plastic trash, that is choking and poisoning the life out of tens of billions of marine land and birdlife every year. + Trillions of megawatts of heat released from mining, and smelting billions of tons of iron and steel, to make trillions of tin cans, vehicles, trains, ships aircraft, industrial and domestic machinery etc. etc. etc. + Billions of kilowatts of heat released from oceanic acidification, and chemically reactive domestic and industrial effluents every year. + Billions of megawatts of heat released from fires used for land clearance, every year. + Billions of kilowatts of heat released from billions of decomposing trees and vegetation due to land clearance, every year (3.6 Billion trees that were felled in 2012 alone, an area the size of Germany). + Billions of megawatts of heat increase, due to the loss of shade and the cooling transpiration of billions of trees, due to land clearance. + The sum of the extra heat retained by the Greenhouse Effect; due to the release of the 50+% of water content from, e.g. the 3.6 Billion trees that were felled in 2012 alone + Billions of megawatts of solar and motor vehicle heat being absorbed by billions of acres of black asphalt roads, and concrete cities, and released by runoff rain into sewers, rivers, and oceans. + The sum of extra heat retained by the Greenhouse effect; due to billions of cubic metres of heat-absorbing and radiating hydrocarbons being released into the atmosphere every year. www.fromthecircletothesphere,net	UC_fw5i-7AtOk3SpWl3_bILg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_fw5i-7AtOk3SpWl3_bILg	1	Ugyfl_dzL-Tz63jVcR54AaABAg	James Kurt Smith

If they were so cheap the market would have transitioned completely to said energy sources. However, it isnt developed yet. Thats why most solar companies are subsidized, and even then they go bankrupt. Its simply too expensive. Breaking even takes 20 years. Perhaps we should experiment with a town/county that is wholly run on solar and wind. I dont know why you are against nuclear energy as it is the most effecient and powerful form of energy.

Such deterioration allows large amounts of ultraviolet B rays to reach Earth, which can cause skin cancer and cataracts in humans and harm animals as well.

Fog for example, has been radically reduced since the 1950's where I live, because particulate pollution is down 85%. Sulphur dioxides, same thing. NOX, same thing. Unburned hydrocarbons, down 90%. Waterway pollution, cut in half. Multiple peer reviewed studies utilizing AVHRR satellite data now confirm CO2 as the primary reason for the observed 13% planetary greening since 1981. That's observed, and confirmed. We've known almost forever that CO2 is plant food, and that the planet has been suffering a CO2 deficit for hundreds of years. NASA tries to downplay the greening by claiming from lab experiments it's temporary, but in 35 years there's still no sign that's true in the real world. https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/carbon-dioxide-fertilization-greening-earth The planet is experiencing record grain harvests and surpluses for a few years now.

The earth has been both, and far more so than what we have now. Where is the proof that anything is even outside the range of normal natural changes. Until we have a true baseline to go from there is simply no way to even state there is any kind of problem. Is "normal" now? 10K years ago? 100K years ago when most of North America and Europe were under a mile of ice? 100M years ago when dinosaurs were wandering around?

There's just as much research to refute everything you posted.   Scientists are just like politicians. They need other people's money to continue doing what they love and they will find whatever they need to find, even if they have to create it. Not too many years back it was acid rain and global cooling. Don't let them fool you with their dog and pony show. Science assumes they know the initial conditions of earth and how it's evolved, what they weather was like, the atmosphere and so on. These are all assumptions because nobody was there to observe it, measure it or test it. It's forensic evidence at best with no standard to compare it to.  They don't even know what they don't know. Man has been keep weather data for the past 100 or so years and they want me to believe that they have the history of the earth figured out? I'm not buying it. I don't trust science because it's all about the money.	UCzfzQs5vRvajwUKJ0R8PeLg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzfzQs5vRvajwUKJ0R8PeLg	1	UgzdWg45g5Kq2CrJOu14AaABAg	sa madrid

How can you claim to be a Christian but believe science instead of the Bible? The Bible is very clear on the length of a day in the creation account found in Genesis. The Bible is also very clear on how man was created in God's image and not through a process of evolultion. Evolution: change over time. It can refer to anything and not just life. In this instance, it's referring to common descent--our distant cousin is a syphilis bacteria, a banana and a giant saguaro cactus. Evolutionary scientists have a huge agenda--disproving God and they need billions of years for their evolution to explain where we came from. If they don't have that, evolution falls flat on its face. Thank God, literally, that science continues to provide evidence that contradicts science's fallacies. Many things are showing up that discredit radiometric dating and if that's wrong, then the age of the earth, as put forth by science, it wrong. Everything science knows about the past is based purely on assumptions and presuppostions about the initial conditions when everything began. Nobody was there to observe, measure or test anything that took place. It's a guessing game and only when they plug in billions of years to their model, does it all work. Carbon-14 has been found in 2 billion year old diamonds. C-14 has a half life of 5730 years so for it to last one-hundred thousand years would be a stretch. Tree stumps that were dated at 40k years old were found imbedded in Rock hundreds of millions of years old. Fresh, short-lived tissue has been found int dinosaur bones that shouldn't last thousands of years but are supposed to be as old as 450 million years old. Some dinosaur bones that have been found aren't even mineralized. Six independent laboratories dated sedimnetary rock that was laid down from mud flows at Mount Saint Helens between tens of thousands of years old to 2.8 million years old. My point; science has been so wrong in the past. They keep pushing this saying they have it all figured out but it's a lie. They haven't got a clue as to how life even began and we're supposed to believe they know how and from what we evolved? Keep an eye on genetics because it is destroying Darwin's theory.

(( as YOU seem to be claiming )) No, it cannot! This has been the main challenge facing climate science from the beginning: how to distinguish (initially) very small changes in temperature caused by human activity, from: a) background “noise” and b) natural processes. . The conclusion based on many different lines of scientific evidence, from independent Research Teams in 100+ nations is: a) We can clearly detect a systematic increase in global temperatures and b) There’s no other plausible explanation for this other than anthropogenic greenhouse gasses. Yes, climate change has occurred naturally in the past. Climate experts have never needed to be reminded of this by amateur scientists. . They’ve known this for a very long time. (this Warming Ended a Natural Earth Cycle of Glaciation Prematurely ...after 8,000+ years of DECLINING TEMPERATURES Toward this glaciation) . http://www.realclimate.org/images//Marcott.png So—of course—they need to be sure that the changes we are seeing are being caused by human influence… and they are. What’s more, we have a pretty darn good understanding of what has caused past, natural changes in climate. What’s happening now ' IS ' different. Climate is a “noisy” system. . This is obvious if you look at any of the many temperature trend lines. Any given location temperature jumps up and down several degrees from year to year, appearing as “random” variations. What’s more, nighttime low temperatures show a different trend from daytime high temperatures. Yet when this noise is averaged out, most locations on earth (not all, but most!), show a clear increase in temperatures over the past probably two centuries. The year-to-year variations (scientists use the term “interannual”) are caused by variations in flow patterns in the atmosphere, ocean currents, small changes in solar activity, measurement errors, volcanic eruptions, plus other causes. Detecting the presence of a “human signal” against this background noise was difficult and was initially uncertain. As scientists are generally a skeptical lot, it took around 100 years from the time the theory of Anthropogenic (human-caused) Global Warming (AGW) was first proposed (in 1896) before it became widely accepted in the scientific community, which happened during the 1990s. . Confidence in this conclusion has grown Much stronger since then. Bear in mind that proof of AGW has come from many different lines of evidence, and many different fields of science. not just one. . We are confident in the conclusion of AGW because so many different data sets all “fit together” coherently. This would be impossible to accomplish if AGW were a “hoax” as some paranoid anti-science zealots have claimed. Increasing global temperatures are documented through land surface temperature measurements, sea surface temperatures, deep sea temperatures, atmospheric balloon measurements, satellite temperatures readings… all of which show warming. In addition, there are the indirect effects, such as migration of climatic zones northward (in the Northern Hemisphere), shrinkage of both the Southern and Northern Polar ice caps, retreat of nearly every mountain glacier in the world, plus much more. But the question, was whether these changes could represent a natural process. . The answer is “No”. There are no other known processes that can credibly explain the warming that has been observed, other than CO2, released into the atmosphere from combustion of fossil fuels. This is a clear and strong conclusion. Skeptics have suggested other POSSIBLE explanations for warming, but these have ALL been examined in detail and disproven absolutley. Nevertheless, some people continue (even a few contrarian/denier scientists) to propose the same alternative explanations that have already been shown to be false… but these people are not skeptics, but denialists. Denialism first appeared as a political ideology in the 1990s, at around the same time that scientists were becoming convinced that AGW is real. Prior to that, AGW was not viewed as a political threat, but once it became clear that earth was actually warming, and that human activity was the cause, certain political and economic interests became concerned about what the response would be…. And being a bit paranoid about powers of government, they were more afraid of the response to climate change than they were of AGW itself. Unfortunately, rather than making this the topic for disagreement (which would have been a very valid discussion), they chose an alternative approach, which was to claim that climate change was not even happening…. or if it were, that humans were not responsible. Once this viewpoint became entrenched in political ideology, people have continued to believe it, even now that the evidence for AGW is clear. Let there be no misunderstanding about this, AGW was not initially a “left wing” issue. The right-wing paranoia about government influence made it a political issue. This is very, very unfortunate, as if we stand any possibility of arresting or slowing the rate of warming, we’re losing valuable time arguing about whether the earth is flat or round."

You mean All those stories back in the 70's about a COMING ICE AGE. ... Follow the Money, Thousands of Press Releases triggered the Media storm in the 70's. By the decade's end, over a MILLION new Oil Furnaces were sold and the 1958 report/warning to President Eisenhower about the massive industrial dumping of Toxic Waste gasses into the atmosphere and their eventual damage to our climate....was buried and forgotten. 1965 Research Report & Warning with projected severe Climate Changing Effects that seem all but certain in 50 years was buried and forgotten.  Buried and Forgotten ... by the big lie, 1000's of press releases from Big Oil/Gas/Coal about a looming ICE AGE. WHO SELLS HEAT, again...oh yeah! ----------------------- > BIG OIL! This so-called oncoming Global Cooling & MINI ICE AGE has been repeatedly brought up. ... in the mid 1980's, Twice in the 90's. Noted Skeptics Dr. John Christie and Dr. Roy Spencer predicted that Global Warming would cease to exist by 2000 as we returned to our Cooling Temperatures toward the NEXT GLACIATION! We were reminded that 2007-2009 during an 11 year solar minimum, that a NEW MINI ICE AGE was upon us! ...and then THAT ICE AGE was postponed (primarily because temperatures world wide kept skyrocketing up. AND HERE WE ARE AGAIN! .....a new ice age scare from the RIGHT WING NATIONALISTS and BIG OIL ! <-------------------------------------------- a new GRAND SOLAR MINIMUM ICE AGE.. ..snow in summer, bitter cold winters etc. .  WHO SELLS HEAT, AGAIN???.  . ...and the big lie, pays off ! Since 1918 BIG OIL/COAL/GAS have had their hands out for Supports, Sweet Heart Tax Deals and Subsidies. 18 years ago Just UNDER 1% of the entire World's Gross Domestic Product was funneled to BIG OIL as Subsidies. ....that is separate from profits which were generous. TODAY, 6.5% of the WORLD GDP is SUCKED INTO THE DEEP POCKETS of BID OIL! .....TRILLIONS of DOLLARS-------------> Take from the poor and middle class and GIVEN to a few thousand families around the world.

If you are a good reader, critical thinker...you will find that their headlines are often exactly opposite of what those in the article are saying. . Stephen Hawking Tipping point The Cambridge physicist regarded global warming as one of the biggest threats to life on the planet. The physicist was particularly fearful of a so-called tipping point, where global warming would become irreversible. He also expressed concern about America's decision to pull out of the Paris Agreement. "We are close to the tipping point where global warming becomes irreversible. Trump's action could push the Earth over the brink, to become like Venus, with a temperature of 250 degrees, and raining sulphuric acid," he told BBC News. . http://www.realclimate.org/images//Marcott.png . http://www.oocities.org/marie.mitchell@rogers.com/climate_files/1800YearGlobalTemperature.jpg	UCt9UyYrv76HIRb_2mKix47g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt9UyYrv76HIRb_2mKix47g	1	UgzdWg45g5Kq2CrJOu14AaABAg	sa madrid

The climate changes all the time. That's a very normal thing and there is absolutely nothing to worry about. The global temperature is actually not warming. It was doing so till 1998 but then it stopped and it's nowadays slightly cooler than 1998. If the rhythm keeps going on like in the past, we will get a new 25 to 28 years long warming periode, in about 5 years from now. So the info, about the arctic ice is not melting for now, is correct. Btw. the antarctic ice cap was growing about 8 inches per year, during the last 50 years. Why we know that? There is an american research station on McMurdo Bay. It had to be rebuild three times in the last 50 years, because the former two building were all covered by ice an snow. The newest one rests on hydraulic stilts, so it can simply be jacked up, if needed in future.

As temperatures rise, the relative increase of methane emissions will outpace that of carbon dioxide from these sources, the researchers report.

So maybe I don't quite see whats going on from your perspective of my own faith as an outsider, but from my perspective of this, it seems more that the Older generations of the faith a resistant and then when the newer generation moves in to replace them, the newer generations are either more open to accepting these realities or they already have.

Where was the feedback loop then ? Nowhere because it doesn't exist. Carbon dioxide cools about as much as it warms, probably more after the first 200 ppm and the logarithmic effect kills CO2's ability to create heat. It doesn't matter anyway because we're historically cold right now, average global temperature is 15 degrees C in the range of 12 degrees C to 22 degrees C over the last 600,000,000 years. We're closer to falling back into full on ice age conditions than "boiling over" like that scumbag liar Obama said. Can we agree on that ? And yes I think the government should stay out of it but it was them that started this latest scare so they're not going to bow out when there's still so much money left to be stolen and so many of our freedoms and rights left to be taken away. It's all about UN Agenda 21. You should look into it if you don't know what it's about. Oh, and by the way, even if all the lies about CO2 warming and the feedbacks were true and we needed to reduce atm. CO2 concentrations and we kill the economy, resort to stone age living and cut our emissions down to almost nothing... what will we do about reducing the other 97 % natural emissions ? Kill all the plants and animals ? Stop volcanoes from erupting ? Remove all the water from the Earth ? Because that's what it would take to stop atm. CO2 from rising while the planet is warming. The oceans control atm. CO2 levels, not man, not cow farts, not plants and trees.

It works as a positive feedback loop, it grows exponentially. Water Vapor is the most common Greenhouse gas, as the Earth heats do to the increase of carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere, there is more evaporation, thus causing more vapor in the air causing more heating. Then we continue to pump out CO2 and methane, which increases heating more. Heating creates more heating. So its not shitty math just the math is not so simple. If you looked, I gave you my source. 2016 was the hottest year on average, and it has been decreasing for the past two years by about .1 C annually, that would not be enough to turn the trend of its upward trajectory. We were supposed to be entering into another little ice age in 2010, but either we are simply wrong about the causes, or it just didn't happen. Personally, I don't understand you reasoning for the arguing. I don't care honestly. While I believe its fine for them to post scientific findings like with NASA and NOAA, I assume you and I can agree that on a legislative standpoint, the government should just stay the hell out of it?

The Medieval Warm Period was warmer than today, The Roman Warm Period was warmer yet and the Minoan Warm Period was even warmer. We've been cooling the last 5000 years. In fact, the planet has been cooling since the beginning of time and in the long term still is. Recently, from 1979 to present we warmed 0.4 to 0.7 degrees C. I don't care how shitty your math is, that doesn't add up to 2 to 6 degrees over 100 years, especially since we typically warm for about 30 years and then cool for about 30 years, and now we're cooling since 2016 and expecting to cool for another 25 to 30 years at least.

The warming is technically not unusual, its the extremely rapid rate in which it has occurred in the past century. With more conservative estimates of 2 degrees Celsius over the course of the next century (0.02 C per year on average). That is 20x faster than natural levels. Over the course of 5,000 animals can adapt, populations can migrate, and genetics can evolve to compensate. Over the course of 100 years, that is much more difficult, especially for habitats that simply can't migrate like Coral Reefs. If you don't care about estimates, over the course of the 20th century, global temperatures increase about 0.7 degrees Celsius (0.007 C per year on average). That is 7x faster. Earth is still partially recovering from the little ice age, a 700 year period of colder temperatures, so us being in a relatively cold period of history is not unbelievable. The high rate of warming is the concerning party, like I said. I would also like to reassert that I do NOT think government is the answer, for all intents and purposes, it is part of the problem.

That excess acts as a Green House gas (along with Methane and in a way, Water Vapor), trapping heat in the atmosphere and altering the Earth's temperature outside of natural climate change rates. Global Warming is occurring, we are contributing to it, it is a threat to our existence as a species, and the only scam is when people think Government is the answer. Government is probably one of the biggest causes for this problem, both in terms of the climate and ecology. The US department of defense is literally the largest polluter on Earth. The EPA has literally dumped many gallons of mine waste into rivers. Anti-poaching laws have done nothing to actually protect many endangered species. Government regulations and taxes have held back greener forms of energy like Nuclear and the traditional Renewable energy sources. Government regulations have held back other more environmentally friendly innovations like electric cars and "clean meat".

CO2 isn't pollution, it's plant food, also known as "the gas of life", and without enough in the atmosphere we're all dead. All life on Earth dies at 150 ppm. We're pulling the Earth's atmosphere out of carbon dioxide famine levels. As far as the warming effect of CO2 is concerned, it's done almost all it can with the first 40 - 200 ppm depending on who's data and math you trust more. CAGW is just a scam to tax us to death and give power to legislate us all to the UN which is controlled by the elites.

What we see in the Greenland glaciers melting is that underneath is evidence that the land was farmed before the LIA. So it is plain that we aren't seeing what can be strictly called "climate change" but the climate returning to what it was. 2) If indeed the climate is returning to a previous norm man has absolutely nothing to so with this. 3) The greatest lie of the environmental whackos is that 97% of scientist agree. In point of fact about 2% of scientists believed in AGW. About HALF agreed that the climate did in fact appear to be changing. But with insufficient data and what data they were presented with, now showing very large errors, that would now drop to almost nothing. I am at somewhat of a loss about where the CO2 is going. One analysis showed that the growth in atmospheric CO2 closely matched the amount of fossil fuel consumed. I looked at this quite carefully and checked all of his figures and it appeared to be quite accurate. But there is a very large problem. When using satellite data to look for the largest producers of CO2 it is NOT the Northern Hemisphere but the Brazilian rain forest and the central eastern African continent which has also very dense plant growth. So apparently besides generating the majority of O2 the cyclic growth patterns of the vegetation cause a great deal of ground litter that is decaying. Not that CO2 matters in the least since there is very little solar energy in the three low frequency and narrow spectroscopic bands at which CO2 can receive energy. This was saturated at levels of CO2 about 200-250 ppm and so increasing CO2 in the atmosphere cannot be blamed for maintaining atmospheric heat. And satellite data shows it does not. As does the energy balance measurements of NASA.	UCD-dbSNMfqbLl1ZfwloJujw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD-dbSNMfqbLl1ZfwloJujw	1	UgzdWg45g5Kq2CrJOu14AaABAg	sa madrid

Only three things have been established: (1) the clear evidence that, yes, the climate is changing; (2) the hypothesis that climate change is caused primarily by human activity; and (3) a broad – indeed overwhelming – consensus among scientists worldwide that the hypothesis is valid, and a consequent spillover of that consensus into the general public. Nothing about these facts adds up to science. What turns a hypothesis into science is not widespread belief but rather the scientific method. What's required by the scientific method is a long narrative of data acquired through ongoing experiments out in the real world, out in the field, out in nature in all its dynamism and unpredictability. That's how all hypotheses in the past have been conclusively corroborated (or "proven," to use the layman's term), whether we're talking about the theory of gravity, the theory of evolution or the theory of mass-energy equivalency. In the case of the anthropogenic-climate-change hypothesis, most data has been acquired not out in the field but rather in a virtual version of nature created in computers, with all of their modeling and simulation capacity. What emerges is that the primary reason a state of science hasn't yet been achieved is that scientists have in general approached their professional work not as scientists but rather as high-powered, government-funded video-game designers. It's not reasonable to expect the general public, with its general lack of scientific education, to realize that scientists have been committing malpractice on climate change for years, but that's the reality.

I've worked in one form of science or another my whole life. One project leader won a Nobel Prize which would have been impossible without my total engineering of the project. I am experienced designing and programming both gas and liquid chromatography so I am quite good at spectroscopy which people making claims about CO2 most assuredly are not. Give large corporations a free pass on what? Forcing them to limit emissions that are really not part of the problem at all? The "global warming" we are seeing is nothing more than the recovery of the Earth from the Little Ice Age. Sea levels may be rising "more rapidly" but that is quite easily explainable. The lower latitude glaciers that were caused by the Little Ice Age have melted to the point that they are beginning to thin to the point where sunlight can cause them to melt both on the top and bottom. The very first thing you must be extremely careful of it is "projections" being submitted as proven fact. We have never gotten even CLOSE to projecting the MGT changes from this recovery. And we DO have a lot of historic information on estimated MGT since before the Medieval Greek history and we are not warming but cooling as the Sun cools off over time. We have direct comparisons between NASA's claim of "man-made global warming" and the actual measurements made by the weather satellites since 1979. While this is not long enough to tell any real climate, the differences between NASA's released data on MGT from their ground based temperature measurements and those of satellite measurements are so much at odds that it is plain that NASA purposely misrepresented MGT changes on purpose. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming#/media/File:Global_Temperature_Anomaly.svg vs http://www.drroyspencer.com/wp-content/uploads/UAH_LT_1979_thru_August_2018_v6.jpg You can see on the second chart how much that NASA has misrepresented MGT - Remember that Dr. Spencer was the head of the NASA weather satellite program and maintains the actual MGT charts. These show NO temperature changes over the last 39 years.	UCD-dbSNMfqbLl1ZfwloJujw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD-dbSNMfqbLl1ZfwloJujw	1	UgzdWg45g5Kq2CrJOu14AaABAg	sa madrid

The environmental movement has SAID that there are too many people on this Earth many, many times. They mean to limit energy and so to murder large portions of the third world populations. Obama saw this as nothing more than another source of power over the people of this country and took advantage of that. As I SHOWED - the fake NASA temperature plots were taken from GROUND TEMPERATURE SITES. These as all scientists have known for decades were seriously compromised by the Urban Heat Effect which is so difficult to correct for that we might as well say it is impossible. We even have photos of weather stations placed directly in the exhaust stream of large building air conditioners. The weather satellites have been operating since 1979. This is not a long enough period to get any good picture of the climate but what we do have completely contradicts the charts that NASA has used to claim that this year or that was "The Hottest Year On Record". You may believe anything you want but what is obvious is that you know nothing whatsoever about climate science or how its databases are collected so I suggest you study that first before making yourself look like an ass by suggesting that a government agency would lie to the public like Strzok, Comey and Mueller have been doing.

In the three small bands in which CO2 absorbs energy there is very little energy. Over 250 ppm anyway there is no energy left to absorb and so there is no way that CO2 can absorb more. Also, there is something very seriously wrong at NASA. Look at this site: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming#/media/File:Global_Temperature_Anomaly.svg I ask you to be particularly attentive to the period of 1979 to the present. You can see there that NASA is reporting a 1 degree C temperature rise. But this does not appear on the weather satellite charts which is the only complete way of measuring mean global temperate: http://www.drroyspencer.com/wp-content/uploads/UAH_LT_1979_thru_August_2018_v6.jpg What you see on NASA's OWN data is not a temperature rise at all but nothing more than the normal chaotic weather changes from year to year. Perhaps there WILL be a rise but it is far more likely to be a temperature drop after a 20 year warm spell. Remember the same condition lasted for a decade in the 1920's. That we didn't have the same sorts of problems now is because that triggered proper farming techniques, irrigation projects and proper crop selections for the area. I will repeat. There isn't any changes in the climate other than the recovery from the little ice age. As the Greenland glaciers retreat we find that just like legion, there had been large farming under those ice sheets. The Earth is a large place that takes immense amounts of time to recover from these sorts of things.

He received the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1903, becoming the first Swedish Nobel laureate, and in 1905 became director of the Nobel Institute where he remained until his death.[2] His lasting contributions to science are exemplified and memorialized by the Arrhenius equation, Arrhenius definition of an acid, lunar crater Arrhenius, the mountain of Arrheniusfjellet and the Arrhenius Labs at Stockholm University, all named after him. He was the first to use basic principles of physical chemistry to calculate estimates of the extent to which increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide increase Earth's surface temperature through the Arrhenius equation, leading David Keeling to conclude that human-caused carbon dioxide emissions are large enough to cause global warming.

Knowledge is formed from the best ideas, that hold up under scrutiny. There is ZERO research published that would lead a rational person to think the ice loss in Greenland is not abnormal when compared to recent geological time scales. What we do (or don't do) about it is a separate issue. You've been duped into thinking you must deny facts to aviod thinking about the consequences - whether mankind should give up our addiction to fossil fuels. If you don't think science is based on consensus, then look up the theory of plate techtonics. Maybe you can learn how that started - and how it became a consensus over time.

The Earth is an unstable ball of mostly burning rock and we are all trapped on it. Getting some of us off of it before it kills us all, is the only way to avoid our extinction. We don't own the planet, we are it's prisoners not it's caretakers. Life is a murderous struggle, red in tooth and claw, and we are not above it. "A philosophy of exploiting other creatures and people has lead to horrific death and violence in our shared history" that's called biological evolution.

We have alarmists telling us that the sky is falling and if we do not pay up now, or relinquish freedoms or curtail our lifestyle to basically stone age levels, that the world will end. In my opinion, unfortunately anything climate related has become political rather than scientific. So then reliable facts have gone out the window and agendas have taken over. When I hear "a consensus of scientists".... that's political. Science is not consensus. It's proven facts, and as far as climate is concerned, our studies are far to short and the reality is far too long, complex, and a lot of unknowns to say anything with certainty one way or another. When I hear that the United States is at fault and we must pay for all these programs, and subsidize certain energy types, and give money to other countries.... that's political. When people want Skeptics jailed for their beliefs, rather than engaging in a discussion and dialogue, that's political, and actually tyranny. Judith Curry, even though she states humans have a role, she also states that natural forces are the main drivers of climate change. She even retired specifically because of the craziness that has ensued regarding the issue. Probably because it went political rather than scientific. She's probably tired of dealing with it. The Dupes will hear nothing but what they want to hear, and no amount of reason or evidence contrary to their belief system will be considered. It really is becoming like a manic religion for some people. And religion goes on faith and a belief system, not hard facts. Whether or not Greenland and other areas gain or lose ice is not known to be abnormal, it fluctuates through millennia. There is historical, written evidence of quick warming and cooling trends in the past before SUV's and power plants, so who's to say it's abnormal? What if more ice is abnormal? Is anything abnormal? Normal has yet to be defined, from what I can tell. What is your definition of Normal? There has to be a baseline from which to start.

You forgot to mention how in the early 80s Hanson predicted record heat in Europe, and melting Arctic ice. Check out Greenland's ice Ballance over the last 40 years. We do have fossil evidence that the rate of Extinction of species in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, is drastically higher than previous epochs. Deniers simply have not looked at the historical record to see how shockingly different our current climate looks. Weather changes but climates remain the same - changing only gradually over thousand of years. But not with humans changing the atmosphere. Even Judith Curry accepts that humans are changing the climate by releasing vast amounts of CO2 and Methane. Is she wrong?

All they have is computer models predicting disaster 30, 50, 100 years from now. And they scream that we must act now. Yet we have been told of impending climate change disaster for decades. In 1988 the renowned oceanographer, Ted Dansen, told us in 10 years the oceans would be dead. 20 years after his prediction, here we are, they are still there and full of life. Or the great climate scientist Al Gore in 2006 telling us in 10 years the earth would burn up. 2016 came and went and here we are. Or the East Anglica scandal when it became known that the numbers were being fudged to meet the narrative. Or in the early 70's when we were told we were going to cause the next ice age and it was imminent. And what about the sun? No one seems to mention how the sun's output fluctuates, and that sunspot cycles correspond with warming/cooling on earth. Nothing even compares to solar output for driving warming and cooling periods. Volcanic activity is another good example. After Krakatoa exploded there were summers that were like winter for several years. After Pinatubo exploded in 1992 the next couple of summers were very cool, I even remember that. Point being, that changes happen and there is nothing we can do to control it, and therefore I do not see how we can affect it. There have been ice ages and warming periods which is climate change way more extreme than what we have now. And again, what is a normal, optimal climate? No one knows. Different climates are neither bad nor good, they are just different.	UCPjXkjsyZkES-LspSjhvmeQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPjXkjsyZkES-LspSjhvmeQ	1	UgzdWg45g5Kq2CrJOu14AaABAg	sa madrid

The rate of the change is what is alarming. (If we woke up tomorrow and the entire Earth was 10 deg warmer, would that be good or bad? I am pretty sure it would be bad.) Evolution and natural adaptation take thousands of years. Newly discovered species of animals/plants didn't just APPEAR suddenly, they've existed even though we didn't know about them. The largest colony of Emperor Penguins has just been reported to have dropped by 90% in size. If this penguin species dies, do you think evolution can whip up another species in 2 years? I don't think so. Warming is a cumulative process, and it is accelerating. This video mocks the accuracy of climate models, but fails to mentaion that Hansen's paper from 1981 used a model that has proven to be very good. That's a prediction from almost 40 years ago. Amazing really.	UCzK-H55xFOMeeKP0fnyUoog	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzK-H55xFOMeeKP0fnyUoog	1	UgzdWg45g5Kq2CrJOu14AaABAg	sa madrid

But that is very few compared to those that go extinct naturally. Extinction is part of the process of life and has been happening since the beginning of life. That is proven via the fossil records. We did not cause that. Additionally, new species are being discovered. So here we are thinking we know everything and have explored everywhere, and yet new discoveries are still being made. And going back to warming vs cooling vs normal/ideal.... no one can define normal or ideal. Is 2 degrees warmer bad? Good? Or just different? Is 2 degrees colder bad, good or just different? Life has flourished in warmer, colder, and present scenarios. So who are we to say one is better than the other? What we have today may be what we are used to, but that does not mean it is ideal, or better or worse than what's been or what's coming.

It is pure evil to put humanity as the sole, living species that matters. All life is precious. An example is the cod fish that used to exist (for hundreds of years) in the Gulf of Alaska - not surviving the latest 2 deg temperature rises in the water there.

Even 10M years ago and 10M years from now will be a negligible amount of time in that history. Yet there have been massive changes, repeated ice ages and warming periods far far more pronounced than anything we will ever experience. Of course the climate changes, but that does not mean that SUVs and power plants cause it or even add to it. What is a "normal" climate? Before anything anywhere can be considered broken or having something wrong with it you have to know what is normal. Is right now normal? Is 1000 years ago normal? Is 10,000 years ago normal? Is a million years ago normal? No one knows because it's always different. Even in the past few thousand years there is evidence that climates in different areas have changed dramatically. There are villages and cities buried in the Sahara. Which proves at one time it was not a desert. We did not cause that. In the southwest U.S. there are tons of dry lake beds out in the desert. So we know that at one time there was enough rain and water to have lakes. Even a few hundred years ago the Anasazi could grow beans, corn, squash etc in what is now desert. And that's less than 1000 years ago. We did not cause that either. So yes, the climate changes and always has and always will, and it's obvious that whether humans are present or not, these massive processes will continue. They are so huge we have no bearing on what happens. We are just a tiny fleeting spec in earth's history. We could be gone tomorrow and in less than 10,000 years there would be little evidence that we were ever here. In a few million years there would no evidence that we were ever here. And even that is a tiny blip in earth's history. We may think we're "all that" but really, we are very small and insignificant.

Now what can not be denied is we still do massive harm to the environment through Habitat destruction and physical pollution, such as the large islands of plastic in the middle of the Earth's oceans. Another example is the dumping of waste into rivers... like that one time the EPA dumped many gallons of mine waste water into the Colorado River, threatening both human life and animal life/habitat. Air pollution also comes from other places than factories as you probably could have guessed, like the thousands of cars, tanks, aircraft, warships, and more importantly military ordinance the Government use everyday. If you can't see my point yet, if we effect Climate Change as much as they say, maybe we should first address the #1 largest single polluter on Earth: The US Government.

Science has to constantly adapt to new information and new discoveries. Science has to constantly throw out massive portions of itself in favor of new and more accurate information. If it doesn't then yeah it ain't science, you are treating it like a religion. Religion doesn't necessarily need to adapt to new information but it develops explanations to that information on the spiritual level. Its like with Christianity, even if some don't want to believe it can be this way, you can have Evolution be true but the Religion itself doesn't change, it just develops its own reasoning behind the natural phenomenon. When Religion is treated like Science and Science treated like Religion, we are pretty much screwed.

Right now in the United States, we tax about 6.7 trillion dollars in a 19.8 trillion GDP economy. We tax at the state level Sales taxes at over 700 billion, income taxes at over 700 billion and property taxes over a trillion dollars. If those taxes were on carbon fuels like Natural Gas, Oil and Coal use instead, we could reduce the use of carbon fuels and still have taxes to fund the things we have Government for, education, police and criminal justice system protection, roads and bridges.<br /><br />If all motor vehicles paid a tax on the gasoline they use and not a sales tax on the purchase of the motor vehicle, a hybrid engine and motor system could be in every vehicle and still use 33 percent less gasoline. And putting in a hybrid engine and motor in every motor vehicle would increase employment in manufacturing. Manufacturing employment increases when putting in machines that use less carbon fuels.

Stossel have already talked about whether its dangerous (I live in Canada, so I&#39;ll take the warmth). Carbon? Really?! That is the stupidest thing ever. Every animal emits carbon (predominately in Carbon Dioxide). The two main ways are exhaling and farting. Carbon is more important to every organism on this earth than oxygen (that I know of). There are also the hundreds of statistics supporting either side. So, I think of it logically. One, is that over 60% (I don&#39;t recall the exact number) of the atmosphere was Carbon in the Devonian period. Life flourished. So what if the ocean&#39;s rising? Just go to the midwest, I&#39;m sure the Democrats would love to create a huge welfare to help people do that and blame the increased debt on the rich. So how much is fracking contributing, well think of it this way:<br />---Humans live only on land. Seeing that 77% of the earth is water, that dwindles the amount of earth humans take up to 23%.<br />---However, humans don&#39;t liver everywhere on land. Antarctica, the Sahara Desert, most of Australia, Canada and Russia, much of the Amazon rainforest, and plenty more spots of earth are uninhabited. That dwindles the number to maybe 14%.<br />---So how much of what humans inhabit is taken up by fracking factories? Maybe 0.001%. So about 0.00014% of the earth is taken up by fracking factories. So I&#39;m supposed to believe that 0.00014% of the earth is responsible for over 70% of the carbon in the atmosphere?

You should NOT expect the truth about climate change from a libertarian ideologue like Stossel whose commitments, education and level of knowledge prevent him from being taken seriously on scientific questions. And to be fair, you should not go to celebrities on the other side, like Leonardo di Caprio, either. You should base your views on the scientific literature.

That's the point of the scientific method. There's nothing at all stopping you from reviewing the evidence and drawing your own conclusions and publishing or selfpublishing an analysis. That's the fucking point of the peer review process. The real problem is that you've never even read a paper in your fucking life and just listen to what biased media tells you. I think it's far more likely that the shit you're reading is paid by people who want to convince people there's nothing wrong and fossil fuels are fine and the Earth is totally gonna be fine and we're not hurting it (which is so fucking hilariously wrong it hurts). Let me explain. I like John Stossel because his videos about gun ownership are good. But this video is bad. Notice how he distracts you with graphs showing more people die of cold exposure than heat exposure. Trying to convince us that a little heat can be good! But the problem isn't the fucking temperature at all! At least not directly. It's the destruction of ecosystems and wildlife, de-fertilization of croplands and soil, mass species extinction in ocean life leading to less oceanic food sources, droughts and lack of rainfall, stronger hurricanes and natural disasters, sealevel rising and melting icecaps, etc. The real damage will of course vary by regions and some places will actually be fine. But as a whole, it's a bad thing, and the real issue that drives me bonkers why conservatives are obsessed with sticking their heads in the sand is the MIGRANTS. Poor regions will be affected, food sources and weather and the factors I mentioned above will drive them out of their geological location and migrate into more affluent regions. Jamming even more poor and unassimilated migrants into fewer and already populous and established first world countries will probably have some pretty negative effects. It comes down to this: CO2 and methane are both greenhouse gases. Nobody disputes this, it's something we can measure in a laboratory a hundred times over. We also know that we are creating CO2 and releasing it into the atmosphere. That one's obvious too. We know that methane is far worse of a greenhouse gas than CO2, and melting ice in Siberia and melting permafrost in other regions also releases trapped methane and CO2, making the problem worse. So even if you're looking around now and going "Doesn't seem like a big deal, I can't even tell if we are causing it!" is fucking retarded because we know EVENTUALLY we're gonna have to deal with it. We can't just keep pumping CO2 and methane into the atmosphere and expect nothing to change for our children and our children's children. That's why we should start now and work towards better sources of energy. Like, why the fuck would you be against better batteries and energy storage, solar and wind and power that doesn't have nearly the same impact. I'm completely convinced that videos like this and people going around acting like climate change is a big hoax, they are just sticking their heads in the sand because they have succumbed to identity politics, and they've been told by Fox and right wing media (famously corrupted by oil industries might I add) that it's just a liberal hoax. Those people are lost. They no longer can think for themselves.	UCR4BinkRsO1yVsPbqZw-Kyw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR4BinkRsO1yVsPbqZw-Kyw	1	UgyUFCzXcAJhwNHwY1Z4AaABAg	Joseph Mellen

These lakes extend from the eastern Northwest Territories, through most of northern Canada, and the upper Midwestern United States (Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan) to the Finger Lakes, through Lake Champlain and Lake George areas of New York, across the northern Appalachians into and through all of New England and Nova Scotia. At times, the ice sheet&#39;s southern margin included the present-day sites of northeastern coastal towns and cities such as Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Boston, New York City, and Great Lakes coastal cities and towns as far south as Chicago and St. Louis, Missouri—and then followed quite precisely the present course of the Missouri River up to the northern slopes of the Cypress Hills, beyond which it merged with the Cordilleran Ice Sheet. The ice coverage extended approximately as far south as 38 degrees latitude in the mid-continent.[2]<br /><br />Ok, who were the men who melted all that ice 20,000 years ago?

I recommend to invest some money into technologies to increase the &quot;carrying capacity&quot; of the planet (high risk investments);<br />A. decrease environmental impact per capital <br />B. alternatives for our food system input to improve production<br />C. alternatives to our current living arrangements, <br />D. alternatives to our plastics industry, <br />E. alternatives to disaster capitalism<br />F. &quot;Savior technologies&quot;, ie faster-than-light travel, &quot;game changer&quot; technologies, ie Cold fusion energy &amp; &quot;delaying technologies&quot;, ie deep drilling technologies.<br />6. I also recommend you inform and prepare your family, friends, and others. It is best to initially suggest people have an emergency kit... for any emergency such as flood, earthquake, tornado, hurricane, loss of electricity due to a winter storm. Then, if the friend or relative puts together a disaster kit, what I do is introduce Peak Oil (by telling them of the 43 second movie trailer <a href="http://m.natgeotv.com/ca/2210-thecollapse/videos/collapse-of-earth">http://m.natgeotv.com/ca/2210-thecollapse/videos/collapse-of-earth</a> , the &quot;National Geographic Collapse&quot; movie on YouTube, &amp; free book downloads;<br />7.

Moreover, challenging climate change requires global leadership and global standards on regulation, something which both leftist internationalists and MNCs love. Another reason why MNCs love climate change initiatives is because regulations imposed on businesses is proven to sqeeze out smaller competitors without the same liquidity.

WTF dude, you don't even know how to google. This shit ain't hard. For example, the ozone layer: The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer is an international treaty designed to protect the ozone layer by phasing out the production of numerous substances that are responsible for ozone depletion. The two ozone treaties have been ratified by 197 parties, which includes 196 states and the European Union, making them the first universally ratified treaties in United Nations history. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Protocol Universal means every country on the planet agrees that CFCs are bad for the ozone. While 195 countries & over 200 scientific orgs say CO2 is bad for the planet. What do you have? Who's on your side besides the Koch Sucking Bros, Exxon, BP, Peabody Coal, Sean "Corporate Shill" Hannity, Rush "Limp Dick" Limbaugh, Faux News, etc.?

(typical leftist scare tactics) REAL scientists said that we didnt have enough information. holes in the ozone getting larger could could be how they operate and be normal. SPH's said we were going to die. as is usually the case the SPH's were WRONG. did they admit it? no. they NEVER do. SPH's have made global cooling et al a political issue. they have been WRONG many times. they are wrong again.

UgwFVD5BHdbFxGUOh6J4AaABAg	2	5	2017-12-22 16:42:09	Bram Huysen	Climat change is a natural phenomenon that has been going on in cycles for thousands and thousands of years.t At times you have an Ice Age, then some time later you witness warming (over several centruries). To put it briefly: <br />1. Recent cycles of advancing and retreating ice sheets have occurred approximately every 100,000 years, as agreed upon by 90% scientists. In other words the world warms and cools naturally over that period of time.<br />2. The warmest peak of warming occurred during the Holocene (10,000 years ago, after 80,000 years of Ice Age)<br />3. The interference of man with these climate changes since the 1750&#39;s is far too insignificant for us to claim it has some disastrous impact. The carbon print is only responsible for an increase of 0.2% in the overall increase of temperature since the 1950&#39;s and only a small amount of the ozone layer depletion, which, although real, is not much to worry about (the ozone layer naturally reconstructs itself gradually anyway).<br />- Pollution (industrial and domestic and deforestation) is indeed a problem, especially in India, Brazil and China (the worst polluters on the planet), but even though it it is true they do wreak some local havoc, they have only a very limited impact on the warming of our globe as a whole.<br />- &quot;Global Warming&quot; is nothing but a false theory contrived by the radical left to force the goverments (think Europe) they control through their &quot;Green Parties&quot; (Enviromentalists) to allocate budgets to their cronies, most of which goes into the bank accounts of devoted friends and corrupt politicians (the whole of the EU).They advocate &quot;clean enerigies&quot; (Biofuel, Biomass, Geothermal, Hydropower, Solar energy,Tidal power, Wave power., Wind poweR) as a total replacement for traditional energies that cost only a fraction and don&#39;t.change the climate.<br />- As with so many other things, the radical left is telling you lies, lies, and more lies. Their &quot;climate change&quot; alarmism is FAKE and PURE INDOCTRINATION.<br />Don&#39;t fall for it, do your own research, educate yourself, and don&#39;t forget that if Donald Trump pulled out of the Paris Climate Agreement, it&#39;s because he had a very good reason. You may not like him, but bear in mind he is a successful business man.<br />And good business men can smell a scam miles awy.

Also, as another pointed out CO2 concentration below 150 ppm is dangerous for plants and below 100 ppm is dangerous for almost all life. Most biologists claim that a level of 1500 ppm would be about ideal. A handful of universities have now independently confirmed that if we returned to pastured grazing for animals and rotation based traditional farming then that alone would reduce human CO2 emissions much more than banning all fossil fuel vehicle use!

Anything less is pointless. Sure people can stop driving, but it's too late for just individuals to take action. There needs to be a major, global response.

The damages and costs to human structures and life increase, but you cannot say that natural disasters are increasing and that it is evidence of a global climate crises. It simply is not! So take away possible man released contributions and they are insignificant. Mother nature warms and cools and always has. My point is - quit building on beaches and dunes, in flood zones, storm surge areas, flood prone areas, etc., and there will be fewer "disasters"! Even if all supposed AGW CO2 was removed ( it would take a couple hundred years) the natural climate will still change. To divert trillions to change natural cycles will bankrupt the world! Humans can and have adapted to changes, and will. We just need to be smarter about how we live. We should strive for cleaner energy, but not abandon fossil fuels. Nothing wrong with wanting to live cleaner, more efficiently, and more productively. Just don't throw the goose out which lays the golden eggs while moving that way!

Natural events can't be blamed on the extraction of oil from the ground. The fact is, oil is the only source of energy capable of meeting our energy demands. Getting rid of fossil fuel would result in millions of people dying. The impact on food production alone would be catastrophic in terms of loss of human life.

Global cooling was never a thing. Acid rain was the result of unfiltered coal burning, which has since been banned upon which the problem was solved. Your scientist forgot about tetraethyllead in the atmosphere, another problem invented by tomas midgley as a way to make engines run more smoothly. That too, was banned because it will never leave the atmosphere and if left alone, would eventually poison us, quite literally. All of these weren't funded by the government, but reported by scientists anyway. Clair Patterson fought for the most part of his life against general motors and du pont, which repeatedly defunded his research. Climate change denial on the other hand has long been funded by shell and other oil companies. Climate change proponents on the other hand are purely funded from the government, which has no benefit to seek in misrepresentation in favour of climate change.

Why executed?<br /><br />Because they cannot be reasoned with (see comments below) nor can they be educated.<br />That only leaves one alternative; and the justification for that alternative is self-defense.<br /><br />(Now Conservatives will take that literally, thinking people will see the sarcasm, but the point is that these lunatics, like Stossel, must be dealt with, if we are to be successful in stopping this catastrophe)	UC08ezyy82pXP3Q2_cDGi3-Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC08ezyy82pXP3Q2_cDGi3-Q	0

Maybe this concern happens when people forget God who holds everything, and sustains everything by his power. Perhaps this is both a test, and a time to examine ourselves, to see how we are doing, and let God take care of his cycles. He&#39;s been doing fine since the creation, wonderfully, in fact.

This can be demonstrated in the classroom.<br /><br />2) We have been putting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. No debate there.<br /><br />3) The fossil record shows a correspondence between carbon dioxide levels and temperature.<br /><br />considering (3) one must cause the other or both have a common cause. Since we know (1) is true it is reasonable to conclude that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causes warming.<br /><br />Those who object should answer the argument, not engage in stupid sarcasm.

Combating climate change by taking money from rich countries and giving it to poor countries. Can anyone tell me how this works? How taking money from one group and giving it to another helps? Then there are the ideas of a carbon trading program, which again involves taking money from rich countries and giving it to poor countries. The only thing that happens is that prices rise and it is pushed onto the poor Americans. I keep asking why few people talk about how the US has dramatically reduced CO² levels. The US is back to 90's levels of CO² production. But the reason it isn't promoted, and that people are not being told this is because of the way it has come about. It has nothing to do with solar, wind, or going green, it is a result of Fracking. Yes, fracking has resulted in reducing our CO² production. How? it has caused a massive increase in the levels of methane to the point that natural gas prices have plunged, and methane burns cleaner, and with less CO² production. And technology has resulted in about 14% reduction of loss into the atmosphere during a time it's production has increased by 50%.

It stays there, gradually building up. Imagine running a gas engine in your house. After a minute, it starts to get a lot less fun. The Earth is a closed system. The climate doesn't have an agenda or political affiliation. When gases build up, it changes the climate. Taxing companies that aggressive pollute is encouragement for them to find other ways to function without ruining the planet for everyone else. One thing I don't understand about people like this: Even if climate change wasn't real... Why would you want to pollute your home? Why would you want your planet to be disgusting? Do you just throw trash all over your house? Hopefully not.	UC3ghlFH36tvTZoLJZZPrXrQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3ghlFH36tvTZoLJZZPrXrQ	1	UgwC5oW1CyS_Z9Nj0T14AaABAg	jesse opdahl

We get our information from the media. And the media has been recently revealed to be surprisingly unprofessional, biased, and pretty incompetent regarding Trump and Hillary. I see that the media is biased to the view that man is causing global warming that is about to kill human life. <br />2) A good portion of the public is scientifically stupid. I see direct evidence on YouTube of adults who really believe the Earth is flat. 3) I see that the general public is not scientifically educated enough to argue cogently with those Flat Earthers. 4) The politicians don&#39;t understand the science either, but they will spout the lines that will get them votes, and they will legislate on these matters with the goal to keep them in office, and not the goal of addressing the problem. <br /><br /> So the media will supply wrong, biased interpretations of the science. A loud, good portion of the public are too dumb to vote. Another good portion are too ignorant to interpret what the media says. AND the politicians won&#39;t really try to get it right. Politician will try to look good to voters.	UCREFnT_Z58ahuDDI5tSXvbQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCREFnT_Z58ahuDDI5tSXvbQ	0

There&#39;re no winter famines in America...that only happens in Communist countries and unstable economies.<br />Heat kills less because you forgot to add in heart disease; the primary factor of this is heat and this disease also happens to be the leading cause of death.<br />This is also why hospitals keep their rooms super cold at around 60-65 degrees. It&#39;s a general practice that if you turn up the heat, people die.<br /><br />Opiniatively, I prefer a cold place over a hot. Less energy is being used heating up a winter home, than it costs to air condition a burning home. I can put on more blankets and clothes and eliminate that cost entirely--but there&#39;s a limit to how much clothes I can take off in the heat. <br /><br />I&#39;m Mr. Jason200912.

Earth has warmed 2 degrees since 1900, 100 years and we got a 2 degrees change on an object the size of the Earth, there is no evidence of the Earth has ever had a temperature shift of this magnitude this fast, now where could it come from, volcanoes no all the eruptions during this time there we&#39;re not big enough/ active long enough to do so eruptions cool ther area and earth actually more then anything because the amount of debris blocks the sun) the sun, no it has been quite stable for a long time, human action is the only thing that has gone nowhere but up.... DRAMATICALLY in this time frame<br />The only reason we have not baked yet is because of the oceans, they absorb the vast majority of heat and co2 pumped into the atmosphere, the problem is that the ocean can&#39;t continue to do this forever, they can only hold so much and this is making them more acidic Wich is why reefs all over the world are dying and fish are losing there homes <br />But this can all be changed, it will take time and persistence but we can have our lifestyle and and have a STABLE Earth as well, this is the key here..............stability	UCNg_NSjyOeOVUMxYZrSeJ_w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNg_NSjyOeOVUMxYZrSeJ_w	0

But forcthe past 16 years we have had only 20% of the normal rain. Some of our cities have at the moment only enough water to last two months. After that people will starve. But America has no problem. Average cold temperatures are up to 14 degrees Celcius colder and in some parts summer temperature has risen up to 7 degrees C warmer. Nothing if your temperature is an average of 35 degrees but the areas im talking about used to get up to 48 degreesC now 55degrees. Heat that kill. Happy that Americans can say so what.

G. Wells&#39;s novel &quot;The War of the Worlds.&quot; With a cast of carefully selected and cleverly scripted characters. That event provoked the public with fear and widespread mass hysteria did manifest.<br /><br />What we have now got kick-started around the 2006 junk science fictional documentary drama &quot;The Inconvenient Truth&quot; narrated by Al Gore. This dramatization of a catastrophic world disaster is intended to influence thinking to adopt Al&#39;s movie as &quot;could be&quot; non-fiction. Al Gore &quot;might be&quot; a super genius on a mission to &quot;save the world&quot; from obviously certain destruction. &quot;The Inconvenient Truth&quot; is also reminiscent of the 1973 sci-fi Fantasy film &quot;Soylent Green.&quot; <br /><br />Hurry with no time for scrutiny, the unsettling, non-settled issues pressured &quot;atmospherically&quot; upon us are;<br /><br />We must react quickly without debate, &quot;Leap then look.&quot; Questioning Climatology would only jeopardize all of humanity. &quot;Oh the Humanity&quot; <br /><br />Many people might find it difficult to understand. Al Gore presents a high stakes argumentative challenge to prove him wrong. With a warning, &quot;What if&quot; he just might be right. These climate Provocateurs are committed to a &quot;What if&quot; computer generated scenario. Only &quot;Time&quot; will prove them wrong and time is what they claim cannot be wasted on second guessing their prophecies of cataclysmic world altering events. Until then Al Gore and other Provocateurs will champion their cause by jumping to conclusions. Scaring the feeble minded and Children with Doom and Gloom weather predictions. <br /> <br />These climate Provocateur&#39;s assertions are based on faulty judgments, characterized by idiosyncratic beliefs that are contradicted by reality and rational argument. The enormous amount of weather data that has been stirred up will never be settled while practicing the art of deception. Every weather event is exaggerated by these Provocateurs to foster contention while gaining support from Climatephobes by precipitating propaganda. <br /><br />The benevolent scientific &quot;approach&quot; is to fund scientific research to implement scientific experiments such as ice core carbon analysis, assumptions, and management ideas like &quot;Carbon Sequestration.&quot; As no scientific &quot;solution&quot; is available to man during this futile attempt to curtail the weather with taxation. The intended and unintended consequences of bureaucratic intervention through taxation are what we must take into careful consideration. <br /><br />This relatively young scientific field of climatology seeks a deluge of funding, a torrent to fulfill a &quot;forecasted&quot; need. With the successful implementation of a Carbon Tax Law the funding could reach stratospheric levels, the sky is not the limit. No more &quot;Requests&quot; for funding, Climatologists would have the ability to easily manipulate funding using questionable methods. &quot;Enforced by Law&quot; funds on demand, Carbon Tax is a carefully planned Machiavellian strategy.<br /><br />The global carbon tax has international implications. Demanding complicity with catastrophic weather predictions can be construed as a threat that amounts too a form of intellectual extortion. These Masterminds of &quot;Climate change&quot; tap-dance around serious unanswered questions with imaginary, &quot;delusional even&quot; doomsday scenarios. The implications are not in the best interest of favorable international relations. Any enforcement through Diplomacy will cause tensions to rise all over the world, much higher than the tide.<br /><br />Yes, a substantial financial stake is involved with the undermining of our state of affairs, an especially large one. The &quot;Climate Change&quot; vested interest has a sizable financial potential larger than world oil worth. Many get rich quick perpetrators are involved with &quot;Climate Change&quot; presenting inconclusive scientific evidence is malicious deception. Advancing their vested interests in-order to fleece the world with Al&#39;s &quot;Manufactured Crisis&quot;. Orchestrated by Richard Sandor, founder of the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX) and God Father of carbon credit trading. Although this exchange closed in February 2010 after (CCX) reached ZERO volume. With a contrarian chagrin the typical Bill Nye type of junk science chicanery continues. &quot;Climate Fraud&quot; is a large-scale systematic plan that has been arranged for attaining a particularly enormous financial gain through fraudulent means. This type of ambiguous criminal activity must be discouraged. <br /> <br /> Climatologists un-married but in bed with the corrupt political establishment jointly conspiring. People all over God&#39;s green Earth are not just insulted intellectually our faith has also been &quot;shaken&quot; as Climatology fails to recognize God&#39;s will. I implore Prayer as the solution, not fervent scientific experimentation paved with good intentions. Adding a taxation burden on industrial carbon output will be passed on to everybody. Everyone will be paying through the nose for every breath we take. Carbon Tax is the 24 carat Mother Lode of Fools Gold Taxation, Taxing the air we breath<br /><br />&quot;God, Give us the grace to accept with serenity the things that cannot be changed, Courage to change the things which should be changed, And the wisdom to distinguish one from the other.&quot;	UC6MlCGp3Y2nL2TjU0lww3mg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6MlCGp3Y2nL2TjU0lww3mg	0

I have read books by several scientist who give differing reasons for warming but they all agree humans are not causing it and that it won't be as bad as Al Gore and others say.

Spelling, grammar and punctuation errors are so plentiful, it's hard to understand what you truly mean. Part of good schooling is graduating with a mastery of the materials, and you clearly did not gain mastery. "3 ice ages?" LOL! We currently live in one Ice Age that has gone on for 2.6 million years, with dozens of interglacial and glacial periods. Change is the only constant in climate. Live with it. Adapt to it. But the globalists promoting Global Cooling in an ongoing Ice Age is truly psychopathic.

Like the fact that we live in an ongoing Ice Age and the globalists want to cool the planet. Ouch! Global cooling in an Ice Age? What kind of psychopath does that? 200 years ago, the 1816 year without a summer showed us that 1C of cooling could kill thousands and turn thousands more into climate refugees. The population of Earth has exploded since then, so a 1C of cooling could kill millions. It could also trigger an acceleration of the already under way cooling trend which suggests the Holocene started to shut down 3,000 years ago. Ignoring the fact that a glacial period is brutally dangerous requires a great deal of faith in delusion. Objective data? Look up Tony Heller's channel and see what is being done to the once "objective" data of climate science. It's being shredded.

You're like so many people who treat "conspiracy" as if it were equal to "fantasy." Conspiracies are one of the most common activities of humanity -- likely more common than sex. And in fact, many conspiracies involve sex -- like Tiger Woods talking to ladies other than his own wife. Oops! Not everything is a conspiracy, but some conspiracies are crimes by implication. Example: Corporation hints that they want a favorable result to a scientific study. The corrupt scientist understands and delivers the desired result. The honest scientist turns a report with regrets that it didn't live up to their expectations. When cornered, the scientist refuses to adjust his results. Next funding cycle, the honest scientist is ignored when they apply. And the corporation implements a campaign of slash and burn on the poor scientist's reputation. This happens more often than you may think. One example involved biologist Dr. Tyrone Hayes. Look it up. Publicly traded corporations are all evil. It's built into their DNA. Conspiracies are part of their operating basis. Just look up the Academy Award Winning documentary, Inside Job, for numerous examples. Your comment is nonsense. But now that you know some of the details, you can no longer claim ignorance. Whether you continue to lie about it is up to you.

AT THE Innauguration, FLYNN was finalizing an agreement for a TRUMP HOTEL IN MOSCOW.... Remember TRUMPS CLAIMS he had no deals, no financial arrangmentes, no nothing with RUSSIA????? ** Hillary Clinton was careless, foolish, & arrogant, but she did not deliberately aid any foreign power! ** Michael Flynn Directly acted-on-behalf of a foreign nation, with a history of hostility toward the United States, & accepted a great deal of money in payment for that service. . It was definitively illegal, & comes very, very close to the definition of treason. ** Gen. Michael Flynn’s transgressions were more than 1000% worse than whatever you think Hillary did ! and he was back campaigning for Republicans last week.

Trump encouraged and fostered higher levels of stupidity, ignorance, irrational nastiness, vileness, hatred, bigotry, and xenophobia of the likewise stupid, ignorant, irrationally nasty, vile, hateful, bigoted, and xenophobic Americans. Extremely fortunately, the better of us significantly started the pushback last November painting The House blue. Pushing back further on the way to 2020 when damn probably Trump will be one and done, and the above accurately described citizenry among us will be too.

Both hot and cold which we see as opposites are in actual fact both bad in extremes , the point is to clean up the pollution on the planet. As for descent, maybe many people have a problem coming down to Earth. My solar panels produce energy for around 5.5 pence per kw/h, not quite as cheap as gas but half the price of normal electricity. Further to that the gas price takes no account of the cost of warming and pollution so in reality and true Maths is actually a lot costlier on people and the planet..end of argument , just satan pulling on the hand brake and making road blocks that holds us all up.

When you've owned the property for as long as I have, you then begin drawing social security. social security will not cover that 3.5% per year. We had a good savings.

In the first place 'a big part of the scientist community' agree that climate changes. Very few atmospheric scientists believe that the activities of man are a significant contributor or possibly even a contributor at all. The 97% claim ranks up there at the top of the most dishonest 'studies' ever conducted. While is suspect that you personally have not been paid to be a shill for the global alarm-ism community, there are plenty of people and corporations that stand to make a fortune if 'cap-n-trade' were to become law. The one world government globalists want nothing more than to be able to dictate to sovereign nations. Even a casual examination of the proposed 'climate change treaties' reveals to true purpose.

There is pretty strong, but not overwhelmingly convincing evidence that changes in global average temperature drive changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration. That evidence is so strong that while it does not prove that global average temperature change drives CO2 concentration it is strong enough to assert with near certainty that atmospheric CO2 concentration change does NOT drive global average temperature change. One of the biggest problems for the climate disaster group is that global average temperature change leads CO2 concentration change, often by 800 years. For example, the idea that global average temperature will increase because some time in the future the concentration of a 'greenhouse' gas such as atmospheric CO2 WILL increase is ludicrous at best!

That’s all a lie. And why do they need to lie about it? They lie about it to get support. Let’s say that humans are contributing significantly to global warming. What should be done about it? If you ban the use of fossil fuels, then you set society back by hundreds of years. Are you willing to give up you cell phones, computers and electricity in general? And what about third world countries!? Millions will literally die, without those fuel sources. Hell, millions in THIS country will die, without fossil fuels.

First, at the moment, land bound ice is NOT receding. And recently released Russian ice records suggest that Artic ice (not a factor) is also not receding. In spite of all the hoopla about massive fires in the MSM, the fire incident rate is actually going down and that is in spite of California's blatant failure to control conditions, within their control, that could have stopped some fires from starting in the first place and other to be no where near as severe as they became. Similarly tornadoes and hurricanes/cyclones have been decreasing in frequency and severity. As for the drought, rain fall has generally increased with the warming. Our own human history (insignificant in terms of global climate change history) suggests that increasing temperature by quite a bit would be a boon for both humanity and wildlife.

The higher ground may be scorched due to massive wildfires caused by years of drought. The more humid areas that are seeing more rain may be too hot due to the heat and humidity. There may be less food due to mass extinctions and plants will need to adapt to change faster than they are able to. Power outages, war over resources. All of the people in the major cities that will have to relocate. It doesn't sound all that appealing to me. Hopefully me and my kids will be dead before that happens but since the change is speeding up, I'm afraid we are going to experience a lot of unpleasant events.

The agreement is more formal than that: it&#39;s that ECS (equilibrium climate sensitivity to doubled CO2) is greater than 2 C. IPCC (and everybody but Dr Curry) pegs ECS at 2 to 4.5 C, and Dr Curry thinks its below 2 C. She&#39;s very much in the minority opinion. Considering that only 3 C separates our holocene optimum from the last ice age, its not rocket science to imagine that a 3 C warming could well be catastrophic, at least to our economy.

When global climate cooled significantly during the major CO2 build-up from WW2 to post-war industrialization, that proved how horribly wrong you are. CO2 is a wimp. And the little warming it does create is overwhelmed by the negative feedback forcings of *_water!_* The oceans are Earth's thermostat. Dr. Curry only changed her mind in recent years, after dozens of other scientists paved the way for her. Scientists like Rich Lindzen (MIT), Dr. Roy Spencer (NASA), Dr. John Christy (IPCC). We live in an Ice Age and only the psychopaths and their deluded minions want to cool the planet. Personally, I'm not looking forward to our children suffering another 90,000 years without summers.

Climate change is something that takes decades to develop. And "climate change" is a valid scientific term that was hijacked by Biggest Oil Rockefellers along with their globalist buddies at the Club of Rome in the late 60s. Then, their UN front man, the late Maurice Strong (Canadian big oil) helped establish the groundwork for setting up the IPCC. Climate change has been happening for 4.5 billion years, by nature and mostly benign. Catastrophic anthropogenic global warming is a fake phenomenon created to extort power and money from the planet.

We do not live in an Ice Age. We have warmed much faster in the last 200 than the previous 19800. The climate does change naturally, and you can see its devastating results (look at the warm periods and the ice ages in history and think about all the people who would have to move). It also is not about news media faking it. You can do your own research and find many reputable scientific organizations (with large contributions to humanity) also saying the same thing.

Newer evidence has shown co2 has been higher and the Earth wasnt hotter. The 97 thing comes from a survey of papers at a conference. The vast majority of papers had no opinion, but those that did, 97% said there&#39;s human caused warming.<br /><br />There&#39;s also the question of whether it&#39;s actually bad. More co2 means more plants can grow, reforesting a lot of the world. So it might go up then it will go down naturally. It&#39;s a cycle. Now personally i would rather it be cooler, because i hate hot weather, but it won&#39;t turn us into Venus or anything.

People who believe that humans have warmed the planet should ask themselves why they believe it and I would bet that 99% of them believe it only because they&#39;ve been brain washed. Increased CO2 is a result of increased heat from the Sun. The suns output varies. Think about it, when you Heat something fumes come off it and the bigger the thing is that you heat the longer the fumes continue even when you take the heat away.

The hot output of a hairdryer: if it were only N2 O2 in the &#39;air&#39;, would the output temp &#39;be hot&#39;? If so, how so?  - knowing &#39;air&#39; has a next to 0 (0.024) conduction coefficient, so it is not conduction; and it is not convection. That leaves only RADIATION??   But that would require N2 and O2 to absorb and emit radiation from the electric filaments, and that is a contradiction to our current understanding where &#39;they (O2 N2) don&#39;t&#39;/ &#39;they can&#39;t&#39;!  What gives?  I say: they do emit and absorb; that is my hypothesis; it is just that our current (radiation)understanding is incomplete  and outdated and when done so, will end the problem.

Rather than think about reality he would prefer to act dumb, and to pick on minor issues and ignore the basis. This shows a desperation to discredit the 97% of scientists, but it is not just scientists, its scuba divers and fishermen who see the coral reefs getting killed off, adventures who see a lake where snow used to be.<br /><br />Here&#39;s our starting point, put an ice cube and thermometer in a glass of water, put the glass in a window in the sun. You will see the water temperature will not rise while the ice is there. You must conclude the ice is absorbing the heat energy from the sun. Once the ice has melted then the water temperature will increase and evaporate.<br /><br />Wherever the ice is melting you know there is an abundance heat energy and you also know there is a time when there is no more ice to absorb the energy, further more this is self feeding there is less ice/snow to reflect the suns heat back into space so more is absorbed when that happens there is nothing to stop the temperature continuing to rise to a point where food will not grow and wars will start over water. <br /><br />The poles are shrinking and the glaciers are receding, that is all you need to know. Each year less ice is created in the winter months than was melted in the previous summer. The ice  that come from the land will cause sea rise. <br /><br />Cyclones cannot form when the sea temperature is less than 26.5 C, the more it exceeds this the more cyclones there will be and the more ferocious they will be.

(The average government scientist makes about twice what I make, which is not very much. The average oil exec makes 50-100 times what I make. the average Oil CEO makes 300-400 times what I make. Lee Raymond, former CEO of Exxon Mobil, who retired with a $400 million golden parachute, acknowledged global climate change (IN THE 1980&#39;S!) and began to steer EM&#39;s polices to alternate energy sources, when it was pointed out to him that it would cost Exxon Mobil billions, whereupon he did a 180 and began sponsoring anti-climate change studies (with predetermined conclusions paid for my oil companies). The oil companies have known for more than 30 years the damage they are doing, but their greed motivates them to conduct an ongoing campaign of disinformation. BTW, there is more salary money to protect in this disinformation campaign than in all the government science agencies combined. Aren&#39;t you about tired of being their lackeys by now?

He is the Evan Pugh Professor of Geosciences at Pennsylvania State University. He has authored more than 240 refereed scientific publications about the relationships between Earth&#39;s cryosphere and global climate change. (Info from wikipedia, quote from <a href="https://www.skepticalscience.com/print.php?r=337)">https://www.skepticalscience.com/print.php?r=337)</a><br /><br />&quot;Whether temperatures have been warmer or colder in the past is largely irrelevant to the impacts of the ongoing warming. If you don’t care about humans and the other species here, global warming may not be all that important; nature has caused warmer and colder times in the past, and life survived. But, those warmer and colder times did not come when there were almost seven billion people living as we do. The best science says that if our warming becomes large, its influences on us will be primarily negative, and the temperature of the Holocene or the Cretaceous has no bearing on that. Furthermore, the existence of warmer and colder times in the past does not remove our fingerprints from the current warming, any more than the existence of natural fires would remove an arsonist’s fingerprints from a can of flammable liquid. If anything, nature has been pushing to cool the climate over the last few decades, but warming has occurred.&quot;	UCroaU6gxYzPAfrzJ1jUk8Vw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCroaU6gxYzPAfrzJ1jUk8Vw	0

CO2 is a relatively ineffective greenhouse gas. The most effective and abundant of greenhouse gases is water vapor. The absence of water vapor is the reason for larger temperature swings in deserts. Greenhouse gases are not pollutants. They are the insulation that makes this planet habitable.	UCLK7QhIV4_sfNaJUK3o3O5A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLK7QhIV4_sfNaJUK3o3O5A	0

Look where that got them. Where did that get them? >>>And yes, there is such a thing as a price to pay that's too high, even for the environment. Climate change is going to happen unless you invent a weather-control device, and the first world owes its quality of life to doing things more efficiently, not less. The rest of the world will not stop developing because the temperature changes, unless most of it dies somehow. What you want is to avoid climate change and have a more efficient society. What you're going to get is an overpopulated, under-skilled world that overtakes the first world by virtue of sheer numbers and creates the environmental wasteland it already has out of so much. The Soviets killed the Aral Sea. The Chinese threaten to drain the Indian subcontinent of water. Africa threatens to kill the Nile. And your movement comes after the first world? Why if not the money? WHAT THE FUCK??? We're not talking about policy here. IS IT HAPPENING OR IS IT NOT HAPPENING? You appear to be using the policy implications to justify scientific conclusions. This is how science becomes politicized. This kind of reasoning is, to say the least, NOT efficient.

Let&#39;s keep making more and and more things that are harmful to our climate, because climate change isn&#39;t real. That won&#39;t do <b>anything</b> to it at all. So lets keep making more inventions and weaponry focusing on our own goals and profits and forget about the rest of the world, and our future kids and grandchildren.<br /><br /> Let&#39;s only focus on the now, because screw them right? Pfft... Who cares about future generations anyway? It doesn&#39;t matter how toxic we make the air, because we will be &quot;perfectly fine.&quot; It doesn&#39;t matter how far the droughts go, because things will be &quot;perfectly fine.&quot; It doesn&#39;t matter if some parts of the Earth (Asia) will be too hot to live in, in the future, because we don&#39;t live there, and we&#39;re &quot;perfectly fine.&quot; Who cares about the fathers, mothers and children that live there? We&#39;ll be fine, and that&#39;s all that matters, even if America is supposed to protect the world as it&#39;s &quot;world police.&quot; Let&#39;s just keep telling ourselves that it&#39;s not real, that it&#39;s all a hoax and live our lives freely for the next few years, not caring about the plight the rest of the worlds people and animals are going to have to suffer and die through. Let&#39;s not care about all the species of plants that may also die due to a changed environment.<br /><br />Hey, in fact, why don&#39;t we make the most extreme thing in existence that releases massive amounts of fumes into the air. That will totally help the Earth out. Why don&#39;t we do that? You know why? Because when that happens, they totally won&#39;t be able to deny that climate change is not real. So instead we wait, telling ourselves that everything is perfectly fine, that there&#39;s nothing to worry about, until there is.<br /><br />I think, that in the end, the latter of what I said will be the only way that people will see that climate change is real. And by that time a lot of that damage will be irreversible.	UCrbuEEriumlo8dUvT9iGAew	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrbuEEriumlo8dUvT9iGAew	0

I&#39;ll note just one here.<br />One can never know the outcome of a path not taken. For example, it is impossible to know how one&#39;s career would have turned out had a person become a lawyer instead of a doctor. Similarly, it is impossible to know what condition Planet Earth would be in if Man never existed. Therefore, it is impossible to know if man is causing or has ever caused Global Warming.

And the CO2 freaks aren&#39;t even aware of the Solar Minimum we are entering. Global warming is a &#39;greedhead scam&#39; .

Not one penny is gotten from any other tax payer. The federal government offers a tax CREDIT. A tax credit is NOT a subsidy. A subsidy is money confiscated from the tax payer by the government and put into an allocation pot, and given to people who somehow arbitrarily qualify for the money. I say &quot;arbitrarily&quot; because it&#39;s the government who decides who gets the money. But a tax credit, by contrast, is NOT money taken from tax payers. It&#39;s your OWN money that YOU earned and that the federal government WOULD HAVE taken from you come income tax season, but because you bought and installed a solar PV system on your house, the federal government (in its infinite wisdom) decided you would be rewarded by it taking less of your own money in income taxes. It&#39;s a direct relationship between that one individual income tax payer and Uncle Sam. It involves NO ONE else.

Here&#39;s a hint: It&#39;s the (2) coldest places on earth - well below freezing ALL YEAR AROUND. Now - here&#39;s where the stupidity index really kicks in. Water turns to ice at 0 degrees C. The poles are waaaaay colder than that YEAR ROUND. Which means that the only precipitation is SNOW. You could &quot;warm&quot; the poles up by 10 degrees and the ONLY precipitation would be SNOW. Where do you think the ice-sheets come from? From SNOW. and when the planet begins to WARM - it produces more atmospheric moisture that turns into MORE SNOW at the below freezing poles. And because glaciers move so slowly - that SNOW gets deep faster than it moves toward the equator and melts. Warming causes sea levels to DROP as the ice at the BELOW FREEZING POLES gets deeper. People who express the notion that 1-2 degrees C in global temperature increase will &quot;melt the poles &amp; raise the oceans&quot; are idiots.

I was twelve, they were drilling it into us, the world was cooling at an alarming rate, and we were going to run out of gas also, by 1990. Oh, yeah, and ten years ago they told us that global warming would cause the sea levels will rise twenty feet. Don&#39;t eat that Grandma, that&#39;s bullshit.

Anyone interested in the actual science, including the climategate emails, should watch potholer54. This video doesn&#39;t trust its audience with any actual science but it has plenty of time to throw the proverbial round. <br /><br />Regarding the 97%, AFAIK that&#39;s the proportion of scientific papers, that support anthropogenic climate change. It&#39;s not a survey of scientists, it&#39;s a survey of the science.	UCUtgsN_18ijnP-4Un9OLU3A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUtgsN_18ijnP-4Un9OLU3A	0

Climate Change -- Those hacked e-mails” https://youtu.be/7nnVQ2fROOg It’s notable that in this video she doesn’t raise scientific objections. Why? The basic science isn’t complicated and goes back over 100 years and could easily have been covered in this video but Stossel doesn’t seek to inform his audience but to take the radical doubters’ position to blow smoke. The negative consequences of climate change are already emerging - such as record high temperatures & fewer but more intense cyclones and hurricanes - so those who doubt its consequences now only have to wait another decade to see these increase further.

On April 29, many millions will gather on the streets of Washington D.C. (and in sister marches in cities and towns globally) in defense of science, expression of the world&#39;s spiritual, religious and moral teachings and from the conscience of the human race. Marchers will appeal to political leaders and corporations to comply with international climate accords that commit world powers to the strongest possible changes needed.&quot;<br /><br />Where is this main climate march taking place? Washington DC! The political home of the earth beast of Revelation 13. What does Revelation 13 say the &#39;earth beast&#39; (America), would do? It would form an image of the first beast through the people rising up and calling for the government to enforce the dictates of the Pope and Roman Catholic Church! We are seeing this develop before our very eyes friends!<br /><br />Revelation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3hHi4sylxE&amp;t=13m14s">13:14</a> ...&#39;And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live.&#39;<br /><br />This climate movement is becoming a very powerful movement, and one that could very well usher in the Sunday law mark of the beast. As we know, the pope made the connection between caring for the earth and Sunday keeping in his climate encyclical. And ever since his encyclical, this climate movement has grown very large, not just among the people, but among the churches and leaders of the world too.<br /><br />Oh, but Donald Trump is against this climate movement right? Don&#39;t be too sure about that. There are games being played by our leaders, to deceive. Mr Trump also said that he would withdraw from the UN and stop America&#39;s involvement in wars abroad. Yet he is now bombing Syria, for no other reason that to further the agenda of Rome! So do not trust what comes out of his mouth, as he is just a pawn in Satan&#39;s kingdom, and as Bible prophecy confirms, America will be the foremost nation in enforcing the dictates of the Roman Catholic Church.<br /><br />&quot;The Sunday movement is now making its way in darkness. The leaders are concealing the true issue, and many who unite in the movement do not themselves see whither the undercurrent is tending. Its professions are mild and apparently Christian, but when it shall speak it will reveal the spirit of the dragon.&quot; (E.White, Testimonies for the Church, vol.5, p.452)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.end-times-prophecy.org/bible-prophecy-news-january2016.html">http://www.end-times-prophecy.org/bible-prophecy-news-january2016.html</a>	UCMvpQIE-0hzlJe7mLMIzD2Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMvpQIE-0hzlJe7mLMIzD2Q	0

WHICH IS WHY THE CLIMATE CHANGE AGENDA IS BEING URGENTLY PUSHED! "Pope Francis says we have a grave ethical and moral responsibility to act on climate change without delay, setting aside particular interests and moving forward in a manner as free as possible from political and economic pressures. The poorest and future generations, especially, are depending on it." So the pope is calling for immediate action on climate change free from any political or economic pressure. What does this leave? Religious and moral reasons. And why does the pope want to push the climate action without 'economic' pressure? Because he is pushing for the SUNDAY REST LAW, where businesses will be forced to close. The Sunday rest law (MARK OF THE BEAST) is being pushed by stealth. The Papacy is using all it's 'craft' to bring about the enforcement of their long desired spurious sabbath (SUN-day).

Why trees? Because they take in carbon dioxide to SURVIVE and give out OXYGEN. How stupid can anyone be? Very, just plant trees. How are some people getting rid of deserts? They plant trees and other plants. What else do trees do, they cool off the area around them, try standing in the sun and then in the shade of a tree. Imagine that the shade is not as hot. What else do trees do? The purify the air by absorbing pollution in the air. Did I write something that is too complicated?

It is not hard to read the conclusions of all the major science academies across the world and understand that there is indeed no more vigorous debate on the science. What I find disturbing are dissenters being dishonest about the honesty of the scientists that are actually involved in climate change science. You just make yourself look like you either don&#39;t understand basic conclusions, written in plain english, or that you are part of trying to make public think there is significant disagreement in the science community on this matter. If you not a believer in the generally accepted theory and you claim to be on the side of science, explore this question: Are there any other generally accepted science theories that the general public disagrees with, that politicians debate, and that news outlets have debates on like this. I can&#39;t think of any. Why? Did scientists get everything else right but did a terrible job on this one? Just give it some thought. and if you come up with nothing like I did, please explore why that is.	UCTV61K0YfPOuV8JEr5nzSIw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTV61K0YfPOuV8JEr5nzSIw	0

The Earth itself, without man&#39;s help, produces about 980,000,000 (million) cubic tons of Co2 per year. Man made Co2 is around 25,000,000 (million) cubic tons. That equals less than 1%. Global warming is natural because of the sun&#39;s activities and not sun spots but by the sun&#39;s temperature itself. The sun heats up and it cools down. It&#39;s been like that for eons. The Global warming debate is a total hoax to make rich people richer. Yes, the Earth gets warmer because of the sun&#39;s activities. Median temperatures always fluctuate about minus 3° Celsius below 0° to about 3° Celsius above 0°. Sometimes it is fairly stable at about 1.5° above or about 1.5° below the 0° line. Do some research and find out for yourself. Climate change is normal. Those proponents for the Paris Accord stand to reap huge amounts of $ from humanity. IT&#39;S A TOTAL HOAX. Al Gore and friends can eat shit.	UCYoOp489qBz6hsnRFop5A8A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYoOp489qBz6hsnRFop5A8A	0

So it really should be &quot;97% of scientists that I thought agreed with me about man-made climate change actually did agree with me.&quot;. Furthermore, consensus arguments are the exact opposite of scientific reasoning. Consensus has usually been against every important scientific discovery in history. Science is about carefully conducted study of hypothesis, with any individual being capable of calling all established thought into question. Telling people to shut up and agree with you because you got a lot of your friends to agree is mob rule, not science.

Taxing people that need to get to work every day. Charging more for gas. Actually people should get discounts for themore gas they use. Solar power will not power the planet. The economy is stimulated when people get out of their homes. Move around. Spend money. If I have a buisness and nobody comes in and spends money. I have to do all the work myself. Lay off all or most of my work force. That means people cannot support their familiesl They cannot pay taxes. Because they have no jobs. Pretty soon we have a stagnent community. Then they must look to the Government to support them. Wait or fight for hand outs. We will become dependent on food rationing. If you look to soil sampling research you will find through soil sample tubes that are able to take samples that are up to Thirty Feet deep. These samples are able to be read like the rings of a tree. The thicker the dark or light ring. It is telling of a wet season. The thinner the ring, is indicative of a drought or a season with little rain and so on. Nobody should have to pay more because of the size of thsir carbon foot print.

You can argue both are money and you can pick what side of the street you want to stand on, fair enough.  o.k. so lets throw out global warming from the thought process, for those of you that don&#39;t believe in it, and just take a look at the other environmental consequences of fossil fuels -So2: particulate matter, water health, war for oil, air pollution.... and compare that to the positive points of sustainable energy, such as no particulate matter/very little emissions..... but still some will argue that solar panels kill birds and it is no different than the problems with fossil fuels.  Cats are the number one threat to birds and utility scale solar is in its infancy changes right now, safe guards are being implemented to protect wildlife.  anyway..... .Just make a logical conclusion outside of your party.

Can you say &quot;personal agenda&quot;. I&#39;m sure he knows all about funding; science however, not so much. Perhaps you don&#39;t consider that there is a reason why there will never be 100% scientific consensus - personal and private agendas. Is it wrong for scientific leaders to try to suppress disagreements? Yes. Is it wrong for Corporations to skew the argument by enriching scientists to support their own agendas? Yes. You don&#39;t seem to mention that part, much like you don&#39;t mention the CATO Institutes agenda. Best is your argument (paraphrased) &#39;Even if the planet is getting warmer, is that such a bad thing?&#39;. Wow. Apparently you don&#39;t pay any attention to what is happening to Africa, the Pacific and other parts of the globe where a good portion of humanity is suffering while a minority reaps the benefit of the damage they are causing to the planet. Not that it matters since you also don&#39;t mention Thermohaline circulation, and its importance to the weather of Northern Europe. Apparently, you believe that we should wait until the damage is beyond repair because it will improve the personal bottom line of a small group of wealthy backers.

It was and is all bullshit in order to scare the uninformed and those that are too lazy to check the facts, so that they are duped into giving up their hard earned money to make someone else rich! The Kīlauea volcano has been erupting since 1983 and pollutes the atmosphere with far more CO2 and many other gases in 1 year than all the cars have since they have been invented. In fact, the molten lava falling in to the sea has produced more chlorine gas in 1 day than all the CFC&#39;s produced and used since 1968. To prove a point if the Chlorine from the CFC gas was destroying the ozone that the chicken little scientist were fear mongering back in the 80&#39;s, then the ozone would be gone because of that volcano by now. The 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in and the El Chichon volcano in Mexico in 1982 cooled global temps significantly. Many Southern states in the US had colder than normal winter temps for years after those eruptions. It is all a big money scam that people and governments got conned and continue to get conned in to giving money to fight the fake junk science.

The earth is not a car with closed windows in which the sun heats the atmosphere. Someone using that argument doesn&#39;t know what is going on. The atmosphere in the car could be all nitrogen which is not a greenhouse gas (greenhouse gases must have 3 or more atoms per molecule) and the closed car would heat up to over 120 degrees. This overheating happens daily in this country when stupid parents kill their children.<br /><br />James H. Rust, professor of nuclear engineering (ret.

Few people outside of fields related to nuclear physics are able to grasp the significance of the power density between nuclear fission and even the most energetic chemical reactions. When the subject of waste comes up, their eyes glaze over and the look of panic creeps into their face. Do any of them realize that the waste problem with fossil fuels is almost half a million times greater? And the majority of that waste is just dumped into the atmosphere. Add to that the fact that most fossil plants (including automobiles) release far more radioactive material into the environment than does a nuclear power plane.

The light is either infrared or it is not. Glass does not 'convert' light. You are at least somewhat correct in that non-infrared light can and does heat some materials inside the car after passing through the glass. The heated material then radiates some infrared light which indeed is mostly reflected back into the vehicle by the glass. It is also important to note that no convection heat removal can occur because of the closed nature of the car which is a condition that is generally not present in the outside environment.

The greenhouse gasses do not absorb heat. They keep it on earth. The same way that light getting into a car is turning into infrared light, which can no longer pass through the windows and is therefor trapped inside.

I used to run a unit operation of scrubbing burned waste gases containing a little bit chlorinated hydrocarbons with sea water. I would sometimes sample the gases and the effluent water and the amount of CO2 as carbonate and bicarbonate in the water was staggering. I realized that the northern and southern oceans, are cold and stirred by huge waves that approximate a counter current scrubber and would carry that toward the tropics where it would fall out as carbonate ooze. I instantly realized that the first work by Roger Revelle was in error and must be modeled after sea water and air being at rest instead of a foamy wave as in the real world. The only place where significant global warming occurs is in the models of the climate frauds.

In fact, looking at the climate record (including paleoclimate), CO2 shows itself to be a wimp in controlling temperature. It's one minor forcing agent. If people knew that Venus has something like 220,000 times as much CO2 as does our atmosphere, they'd likely stop saying "runaway greenhouse warming like Venus." Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of this entire debate is the fact that we currently live in an Ice Age and the globalists who started the "climate change" conflation with "catastrophic anthropogenic global warming" want to cool the planet. Who in their right mind wants to cool the planet in an ongoing Ice Age, when history shows that warming produces prosperity and abundance? Who indeed?

That is one of the BIGGEST Bull Shit labels that the globalists have come up with yet! There is a huge difference between recognizing climate change and believing the change (or even a significant portion of that change) is anthropogenic. Your 97% claim is has already been proven to be complete hogwash created by an alarmist shill in Australia. As to your claim that the debate has been going on for decades... yes it has, sort of! and if you are one that is not on the globalists program your funding is pulled, you are smeared and even physically attacked but never debated! Two teams of scientists recently came up with an entirely new hypothesis concerning climate change. One that does have pretty strong empirical support. The hypothesis asserts that what causes these known cycles of high temperatures and ice ages is variations in our position in the Milky Way spiral arms. It is the hypothesis that I have heard of that actually predicts that the cycle will exist.

Do we have fifty years before it kills a single species in a rainforest, so we're perfectly fine in just ignoring it since the increasing price of fossil fuels will incentivize green technology naturally?

As for the ignorant statement of getting rid of the current ice age and encouraging the sea level rise of 200ft, don't you realise that would affect 90% of the worlds population?

First off, the oxygen we breath does come from some trees, but you can cut down all the trees in the world, there would be plenty of oxygen to go around and CO2 would still be filtered. Almost all of the CO2/Oxygen cycle comes from smaller plant, sea/water plants called phytoplankton. Then a small portion comes from small plants, grasses and weeds, plants that grow extremely fast(compared to trees), then a tiny, tiny gain comes from trees, they take to long to grow and when they decay, they produce a lot of CO2, so there is almost no benefit to Oxygen in theCO2/Oxygen cycle.

Burning fossil fuels, cleanly, would allow them to live longer and healthier lives. CO2 is not the problem! CO2 is in short supply -- at dire starvation levels, dangerously close to *_CO2 Mass Extinction!_* *_150 ppm_* -- CO2 Mass Extinction *_400 ppm_* -- CO2 today *_800 ppm_* -- CO2 starvation trigger which forced plants worldwide to evolve C4 species *_1,600 ppm_* -- CO2 Normal *_4,000 ppm_* -- CO2 abundance *_8,000 ppm_* -- Rich CO2 levels, the kind which allowed so many plants that it gave us our fossil fuels *_10,000 ppm_* -- Nominal CO2 on naval submarines *_20,000 ppm_* -- Maximum recommended CO2 on NASA spacecraft *_210,000 ppm_* -- The level of oxygen in our atmosphere, and possibly the level of CO2 when Earth had zero oxygen (before photosynthesis). *_965,000 ppm_* -- CO2 level on Venus; but add to this the fact that its atmosphere is 92x thicker than that on Earth. This gives Venus more than 220,000 times as much CO2 in its atmosphere as we have in ours.

I recall my mother-in-law fighting the thrust to nationalize education in the 1930's. (Yeah, I'm THAT old). She was a teacher and a critical thinker who produced 2 sons with the same bend. I married one of 'em and got an ear full for years. My final split with the ed system when the back and forth started as to sex ed. First Bush Sr and the celibacy thing followed by Clinton and the condom machines (tax funded) in every jr high through high school in the US. Those decisions belonged to individual families, IMHO. We have had a growing, encroaching, in your face government going wild for far too long, and a paralyzed public without adequate critical thinking skills to counter the sons-of-guns. That being said, I had a pretty good poly sci teacher in high school in the very early '60's who was good at awakening students. It sure would be nice if we had that again to confront some of the sacred cows with which we are now stuck.

But first there must be trusted resources on which the American public can rely. There are many spin-masters out there that give not a balanced or accurate view. In the past it was a cultural norm to not discuss or argue politics as there were too many differing points of view, and we were so very polite, we did not want to offend anyone with our differing points of view. Accompanying that were the folk who liked to assign names to those differing points. If one didn't like the assertions of the other, the practice was to assign names to the opposition. Names such as 'commie,' 'libtards,' 'right wing' radicals, and more. That would silence the debate, and nothing would be accomplished. All that did was offend and make the opponent feel very smug. So the next question is after deciding that Americans must be less like sheep is, how to accomplish that. On the 'love it or leave it' comment, I viewed the problem much greater than I with far too few on board, so I opted to leave.

The point of scientific research is nog for one scientist to find "the truth", but rather to develop reliable, valid, and consistent experiments. If we stood by the "It takes only one scientist to know the truth" rule, anything and everything could be considered emperical evidence, regardless of whether or not the experiment and its results can be verified and repeated. Science isn't a religion where one person knows the truth, it's about spreading knowledge through the use of emperical evidence gained from a multitude of experiments performed to obtain similar results.

The real issue is that the consensus in one thing was being sold as the consensus in other things. There was a halo effect. It's not really about appeal to authority or to people falacies.

In the sciences, paying positions are usually offered to people who are scientists. There's always going to be a climate, and it's always going to be important. It's the source of all agriculture. Climate scientists don't need this crisis in order to have jobs. What money? Tell me what money you're talking about. Do you have some facts to share? Do you have a source for this inside information about funding? Scientists are working with research and data, not consensus. The reason why 97 per cent of climate science believe global warming isn't that 97 per cent of climate scientists believe that. But consensus is the best tool that non-scientists have for making policy. It's not perfect, but it's better than the the poorly- reasoned industry-generated conspiracy shit you're shoveling.

But, I'll leave that post be, and address your paragraphs briefly. 1. Fair enough. 2. When you say _"...it is possible that mankind's contribution, if any, to increased atmospheric CO2 may be less direct than you allow"_ you're asserting the possibility that the gigatons of CO2 that we know humans release into the atmosphere each year may somehow...not be released into the atmosphere each year? If not, then where is it going? And, regardless of whether humans kicked off the current warming trend, or whether the rise in CO2 levels is purely a trailing indicator, with global warming here and now (regardless of whether we started that ball rolling) if we pump gigatons of CO2 into the atmosphere now, it's going to exacerbate the problem, either way, you can surely accept? 3. Just as people constantly bring up Al Gore, you keep bringing up increased frequency of flooding. I don't recall making such a claim, so it seems like a distraction. As I typically do, I am calling this red herring and asking that we don't let it distract us any further. 4. _"The accusation that AGW 'deniers' (a hateful and stupid term which should be an embarrassment to those who use it)"_ There are those who are legitimately skeptical. There are those who legitimately doubt something. And there are the vast majority of non-believers on many topics who are aptly labelled 'deniers' because they deny it outright, and are tribally entrenched in their views. It's a term that ranges in depth from mild derision to outright mockery, and I see no harm in using it to refer those who deny something (whether it be anthropogenic climate change, evolution, racism, or or the efficacy of vaccines). I will accept that there is a deep implication of incorrectness on behalf of the deniers, but I'm not ashamed or embarassed to use the term when and where it's appropriate. People who cherry-pick, data-mine quotes, etc *are* deniers, as they're not honestly being skeptical or doubting - they're trying to _'win'_ through dishonest means. So the term, with all the derision/mockery it implies is apt. Now, onto your wider point. Yes, *some* cherry-picking does occur in the pro-ACC (anthropogenic cllimate change) camp. And I will concede that every time *any* weather event is unsually severe, or especially if they break the historical record, they're thrown about as _'proof'_ of climate change by many people. *But* ACC models predict swings in weather, and more extreme weather events, and these record-breaking weather events are *strong evidence* in favour of the model's accuracy. Climate change deniers typically seem to demand some magica bullet, like some missing link/transitional form from evolution, that will magically *prove* ACC is real. But just as there is no missing link, there is no one weather event that will individually _'prove'_ ACC to be true to the satisfaction of anybody. So, yes, it's simplistic (and sometimes just ignorant) of people to cite hurricane X, or flood Y as _'proof'_ of ACC. But the point that extreme weather events are the predicted result of ACC, and therefore any one event's *severity* (not the event itself, but its severity) is likely caused by ACC remains sound. _"The scamming and even falsification of records on the part of AGW proponents is distressingly well documented and it is that bastardization of the data base which is the worst form of 'cherry picking'."_ Once again, a completely unsupported claim. _"and, if you do not like the constant invocation of Al Gore, well, tell him to quit showing that 'hockey stick'."_ OK, now I'm losing my patience for your foolishness. I am not that man's keeper, and neither he nor I am forcing *you* to keep harping on about him. He doesn't speak for science or scientists. He doesn't speak for me, and I don't speak for him. And it is a *most disingenuous* practice to choose the least of a theory's proponents as a straw-man. If you're right, go after his sources. Go after some bigger fish. If you doubt that hockey graph, then provide your refutation of *its* accuracy, rather than dredging up Al Gore's name constantly as the straw Boogey Man for ACC denial. Why don't you go after some _actual_ authorities? Provide some evidence against the data and findings of NASA, the IPCC, the National Weather Service, the Bureau of Meteorology, or a *proper climate scientist* (or even just a well-informed scientist at all would be a start). If you can do this - even a token amount - I might re-engage in debate and read the rest of your post.

UgjrBZVVFPwJ63gCoAEC.8VdyKvzSke-8XCfbzt2gUS		0	2017-09-07 10:47:56	WeAreSoPredictable	To make things more productive, perhaps some references could be provided. There's a lot of "Blah is happening" countered by "Na-ahhh....blah is not happening." Not much "Blah is happening, and here is the evidence" going on, unfortunately. As for the burden of proof, though, here are a few points: 1. Anthropogenic Climate Change is not something that can, at this stage, be taken as presumptively correct, since there are so many variables and unknowns that make that level of certainty unreasonable. However, it is widely accepted as extremely likely to be the correct model, with room for error. In short, the statistical probability that humanity's CO2 contribution towards global warming is *not* the straw that broke the camel's back, and merely a coincidence with extremely close correlation, exists, but is extremely low. I mean, since we stupid humans are denuding the planet at a great rate, who knows if the CO2 we're pumping out isn't the straw that broke the camel's back, and the deforestation alone broke its back long ago? 2. The unicorn hypothesis is not falsifiable. Anthropogenic climate change *is* falsifiable to the extent that if the data, or the models, could be shown to contradict the theory in any way, and the effects of CO2 could be shown merely to be correlative and not in any significant way causative, then the theory would necessarily be thrown out and a better one adopted. 3. Deniers of anthropogenic climate change routinely cite cherry-picked data, data-mined quotes, drag Al Gore into the equation, and typically show little to no understanding of climate models. They are typically swayed by inane, uneducated, anecdotal evidence that they naively think disproves the theory, without providing any evidence to support their claim. Those of us who understand the science well enough to know that CO2 levels *will* have an impact on global temperatures, for example, are constantly asked to provide evidence in support of the anthropogenic climate change theory. What evidence are we supposed to provide? CO2 levels over time? Sea-level temperatures over time? Atmospheric temperatures over time? Deglaciation over time? The patently obvious correlation of these factors with human activity (deforestation and CO2 production) that lead us to conclude that, with a statistically sound degree of certainty, the correlation *is* due to causation? There is no magic bullet that *proves* (to use that term in the very unscientific way it's typically thrown about) the model is correct, because at this stage the model is not complete enough. But the model is robust, and none of the collective evidence that supports the model's primacy has been falsified yet, despite the claims of victory that deniers cry out when any _one_ data set turns out to be wrong, or one anomaly or exception arises.

UgjrBZVVFPwJ63gCoAEC.8VdyKvzSke-8X55xi288V3		0	2017-09-04 12:12:55	WeAreSoPredictable	_"In The Inconvenient Truth Al Gore says if we dont do anything in 10 years we will pass 'the point of no return'...."_ Firstly, as always, it's a red herring to constantly use Al Gore (you know - not a scientist) as the pin-up boy for scientific consensus. That dead horse has been beaten till it's jelly and still it's being beaten. Documentaries are frequently inaccurate, but that doesn't invalidate the entire point and prove the opposite to be true. The conspiracy theory 'documentary' I watched that ostensibly debunks the moon landings was a joke, but its inaccuracy don't prove the moon landings occurred. We go to the direct evidence for that. _"...Meaning that nothing we can do now will stop global warming from destroying Earth. So ten years later, we should be fucked. Its over bro. Game over. We dead."_ I'm absolutely not commenting on how right or wrong Al Gore was about that claim, since it's immaterial if you don't even understand the basic concept of a point of no return. Do you understand the point of no return even? It seems not. if I'm flying in a plane from point A over an ocean to point B, with just enough fuel to get to point B, just over halfway I'll pass the point of no return. That doesn't mean the plane falls out of the sky at that moment, or that we won't make it to point B. it just means that we're too far along to be able to amend our course and return to A. Either way, _even at the moment that you pass the point of no return_ it's going to be a long time until the final outcome of passing it comes to pass. It's not an immediate thing. It's not that difficult a concept. As far as global warming goes, if you understand even the basics, you will understand that there are feedback loops within the climate system. For example, glaciers reflect sunlight at a wavelength that can readily escape the atmosphere and therefore fail to warm our climate. However the land *under* a glacier, if the glacier melts, will reflect/radiate the heat at a wavelength that is absorbed by CO2, thus trapping a little extra heat than if the glacier were still there. And this extra heat makes the glaciers melt a little faster, which traps more heat. It's not that difficult a concept. So, we're constantly passing points of no return for various outcomes. We've long passed the point of no return (hundreds of years ago) for no atmospheric warming resulting from carbon emissions. We've passed other points of no return along the way. Now, exactly *which* points of no return we've passed are up for debate. As I said, I'm not commenting on specific points of no return, and whether Al Gore's claims were wildly inaccurate or not. But to conclude it's all bogus because you don't understand points of no return or basic climate science, all because some *non-scientist* said something incorrect in a *documentary* is not being rational or scientific.

I have social anxiety and my therapist thought this would be good for me. Any way I read and watch everything I can pro and con then research for myself. Yes it is true almost all scientist say we are warming the lie comes when they say all scientist say it is caused by man a lie told by the propaganda news."_ Firstly, _"the propaganda news"_ just makes you sound like you really believe the mainstream news media control the world or something. The news does not drive science, and it does not force climate and science agencies to falsify data. It does not force universities and science organisations to create false data. It's certainly true that the news media (both left-wing and right-wing, and there's very little in between) push their agendas, and often cherry-pick what they present, and therefore both sides of the mainstream media are guilty. _"I wasn't implying I new more then climate scientist just saying what I have seen and read from other scientist who disagree with the cause of warming they have different reasons for warming but they agree it's not man and that warming won't be as bad as Gore and others make to be."_ Firstly, let's keep Al Gore out of it. It's silly that people bring him up all the time. He was a politician, and he made a documentary. And me made mistakes. When people discuss history, they should discuss what historians say and not R. Lee Ermey from the History Channel. As for scientists, we can find a scientist who will believe *anything.* A young earth, a flat earth, cow-abducting aliens, homeopathy, crystal therapy, demonic possession, Chi power, telepathy; You name it, and there's a scientist out there who believes in it, and is willing to appear on T.V. or a documentary to say so. So, as always, it's not enough to listen to somebody and decide they're right because their argument makes sense. A lot of unscientific arguments make *more* sense than scientific facts to most people, _because the natural laws of reality are often counter-intuitive._ The only reason you believe your doctor when he tells you that you're sick because of an overload of harmful bacteria rather than because you're possessed by demons is because you were educated enough in school to understand the counter-intuitive germ theory. To people with no education, a witch doctor giving his demon theory explanation will make more sense. _"You won't hear from or see these scientist, you mostly got to read there books or look for them on alternative media, on the news because now days if you have a different opinion you are attaked and not allowed to say it just like what is going on college campuses now days."_ It's not the same thing as what's happening on college campuses. That's just censorship and stifling of free speech by people who think they have a right to silence people with what they think are _'bad'_ opinions. That's a censorship of different ideas issue, almost always without showing any evidence. But if a doctor goes on T.V. and tells people that salt is essential for our health (true), so we should aim to eat at least 100 grams of salt a day, do you think it's fair that he's no longer respected by his peers and is perhaps disbarred and prevented from acting as a health professional? That's not a censorship of different ideas issue - it's an issue of preventing unscientific idiocy from being spread by somebody whose authority will make people listen and take him seriously. No salt will kill us, a bit of salt is essential, so more salt is even better for us. It makes sense. And I'm sure he would be able to selectively choose a graph of salt intake Vs health outcomes and select the data portion and scale to make a graph that clearly shows that as salt intake increases, health outcomes increase. And *that* is where the extra research is needed. Credible people provide sources for their data. And you'll notice that those who argue against anthropogenic climate change _almost invariably_ provide either unsourced data, cherry-picked subsets of data (either for a tiny period of time, or from a very small, localised set of data). In short, scientific facts and unscientific propaganda both look about the same in the media, and in many cases the media _'plays dumb'_ and allows both sides an equal say, with equal time, and does not expect either to show their arguments are actually supported and sourced. Follow mainstream climate science sources, and they usually lead to credible sources. Follow the climate change deniers' source, and they usually lead to other climate change deniers' claims, which *eventually* lead back to nothing, or at best to wildly inaccurate interpretations of data or scientific findings. _"Facts and data can be manipulated. Scientist have always been influenced by the ruling class to go with there agenda thru money or force it's happened many time thru history."_ Yes, they have. But _"Scientists"_ you do, I hope, mean the corrupt minority, and not the largely honest majority. Scientists in general aren't the lackeys of the ruling class at all. If they were, they'd all be telling us that oil and coal will last forever, and that atmospheric CO2 is great for crops and so it's great for us. The ruling class are funded by Big Pharma, Big Oil, Big War, etc. The ruling class are business men and lawyers, or politicians (who start out as business men or lawyers usually). The ruling class are scientifically ignorant. _"Governments love crisis there way of getting more control over us."_ And conspiracy theorists love conspiracies as their way of feeling like they know something special, which makes them the clever gatekeepers to the truth. Governments don't need climate change to create crises. War, terrorism, immigration, Islam, the economy, etc are doing that for us right now, and have done for a long time. North Korea, Trump, Antifa Vs Alt-Right - these are all dominating headlines now, and climate change is old, old, old, old news. It's not being kept alive by governments trying to use the old-news _'crisis'_ of climate change, but by those of us who realise it's a subtle but major problem that the ruling class don't want action on because it disrupts their status quo. Consider for one moment what the effect would be of citizens all adopting home-installed solar power? How does that help the government get more control over us? How does shifting a coal power-plant to a wind farm, for example, give them more control over us? Climate change is not a government-created crisis to distract us. That's a ridiculous notion, to be honest. Remember when the hole in the ozone layer was a big thing? Well, that hole was still there last time I checked, but because scientist-led action actually took place, and chlorofluorocarbons were rapidly replaced with alternative propellants and refrigerants, our contribution to that problem largely vanished overnight. It was a simple enough solution, and because action was taken when the topic was young and fresh, people embraced it. We don't hear about any longer because what could reasonably be done *was done* and we moved on. I suggest, if you're serious about wanting to be _correct and informed_ about the subject, you don't judge people's arguments by how persuasive they are, as bogus arguments often sound more persuasive than the truth. And I suggest you start following their sources back, all the way back to the original sources, and make sure the original sources are both scientifically sound, and not being wildly misinterpreted or just outright misrepresented. And perhaps you could get back to me with a couple of links to the people and arguments you find to be compelling.

Yes, they do need to get some common sense and start reading more. _"There have been 3 ice ages did we cause them."_ Common sense tells you that *climate scientists* of all freaking people would...erm...have read about these and know about them. You know, the same climate scientists that use data *from those ice ages* as evidence that we are having a direct effect on climate change. _"Then how can you say we cause warming."_ Because those climate scientists (and the rest of us who have read more than you, and from proper scientific sources, rather than conservapedia or InfoWars or wherever you're getting your information) can show that atmospheric CO2 is one driver of global warming, along with solar output, glaciation, etc. And, _precisely because they_ *have* _looked at ice-age data_ they are able to determine that the rapid rise of atmospheric CO2 since the industrial era began, which we know is almost entirely human-created, is almost certainly what has tipped the scales and began a cascading rise in global temperatures. _"Pick up a book the Earth has been heating and cooling for millions of years."_ It has. And climate scientists know this. *Common sense tells you that they know this!* I mean, seriously, the idea that somehow you know all this historical climate data about previous ice ages, and yet the climate scientists don't know about it is moronic. Common sense tells you that they know about it. And common sense tells us that between the thousands of qualified, knowledgeable climate scientists, and some guy named steven mosley on the Internet who struggles to throw together coherent sentences but thinks he's outsmarted those thousands of climate scientists in _their_ field of expertise, there's a pretty good chance that Internet guy isn't the one who's right. Is there money to be made off the anthropogenic climate change? Sure. There's also money to be made off treating skin cancer, and selling cures for smoking, and providing shelter to victims of domestic violence. And it's _even_ true that some people will play up such problems to scrape some funds for themselves. But these numbers are tiny when compared to the massive money and power of Big Oil. It's laughable to suggest that the most elaborate and well-kept worldwide conspiracy *ever* would still continue to this day in order to chase the measly money that's available for the supposed lie of anthropogenic climate change.

There is no consensus among scientists about whether we live on a flat Earth, whether the flu is caused by a virus or by demons possessing us, or whether the phlogiston theory or oxidation theory are the right one. _"Science is not about consensus."_ You're right. But consensus, at least on the core details, is the natural consequence of science. If the scientific evidence points to X, scientists will believe X. If subsequent evidence shows that Y is the superior theory, then scientists will share a consensus that Y is most likely. Consensus among scientists is the natural consequence of good science. _"It's about truth, which only requires one scientist to be right."_ And if they are right, *they will create a new consensus* among scientists, once that one 'right' scientist's evidence is validated and verified successfully. _"Follow the money."_ Yes; follow the money. One bubbling brook of money flows towards climate scientists and science reporters, while a vast, Amazon-like river of money flows towards Big Oil.

TRILLIONS of DOLLARS MORE... into the hands of a few thousand families around the world! WHO HAS THE WHERE WITH ALL, to finance a disinformation program????

In July 2016, while he was chairman of the Trump campaign, Paul Manafort flatly denied any ties existed between the campaign and Russia, calling the idea “absurd” in an ABC News interview. Two days after Trump’s victory, Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said, “There was no communication between the campaign and any foreign entity during the campaign.” Asked in January 2017 if there had been contacts with Russians, Trump replied, “No, not at all.” These blanket denials were later repeated by Vice President Mike Pence, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway and White House press secretary Sarah Sanders. ----------------------- Now Yes ! ! There were many RUSSIAN CONTACTS. These adamant denials have been eviscerated in the two-plus years since the election. At least 16 Trump associates had contacts with Russians during the campaign or before the inauguration, according to public statements, court filings, and news reports. Senior campaign aides and members of Trump’s family were in contact with Russians through in-person meetings, phone calls, emails, Twitter messages and more. Trump now acknowledges that there were contacts but says there was no collusion.

It is the inability to set one's own ego aside and make equivocal statements about your research that may be undesirable. If an unfavorable result is found, then they will typically offer alternative hypothesis that fit their beliefs and allow for the statement "more research is needed". So long as there is a question, there is money for research. If you kill the research, then you've just worked yourself out of a job, and that had nothing to do with science or the lack thereof.

No one knows when this all ends, &amp; anyone who tells you he/she knows when, is full of crap. Just like the so-called 97% (more like 40%) of scientist who claim they know it all, &amp; have all the answers about our world &amp; our climate. Their predictions are only as good as their simulations (computer models of climate change). Anyone who works with simulations, as in the electronic design world, knows simulations are only as good as the information included in the computer programs. If you want to get grants ($) from the government, they will give you $ if you promote their lies. The harder the alarmist try to convince the world, the more wrong they are. Why can&#39;t you get $ to promote that MMCC is not real? Because it does not fit the narrative of the people who want to control everything in your life. Any thoughts I had that MMCC was real were smashed, when barry B-HO came out &amp; said &quot;MMCC is real, there is no need to debate, the science is final&quot;. First, barry B-HO is a well documented verified LIAR!!! Google it, if you don&#39;t pay attention to what he actually says/said, &amp; does.

To say, not a singe &#39;Solution&#39; doesn&#39;t make some people incredibly rich off the backs of the citizens, while providing at best a 2-3% improvement.. and does not address at all that we will see 100% more growth in the population- meaning 97% more.. OF WHATEVER the climate changes tell us we have to stop.Crony, corrupt, no solution, citizens will pay for it.&quot;do something!!&quot; Pretty stupid maxim to live by, pretty stupid method of policy.If America is to continue to lead in making energy more responsible as to how it is to be generated, &#39;Do something/anything&#39; certainly isn&#39;t a fix in any sense. When REAL National Policy happens, there is always a &quot;Priority&quot; in spending, the existing revenues, are re-directed.. it happened in war, it happened in the Space Race.. these are examples of &quot;Priority&quot; being assigned, it is THE.. example of when government actually believes a needed policy is important.. this isn&#39;t happening!&quot;National Policy&quot;/plan.. could come about, you will know it when 400+ billion dollars a year is re-directed from the existing revenues into the &quot;Solution&quot; or at least an effort to find a solution...And make no mistake, there are several available.. BUT...Power &quot;providers&quot; don&#39;t want them/politicians won&#39;t advance the solution/s...for now, the &#39;need&#39; isn&#39;t strong enough to avoid the &#39;Crony&#39;.

The (rhetorical ) question I have that speaks to your point is without AGW, how much of the funding for climate science would simply go away? Either way it would speak volumes with regard to motive. What we do know from history is that big tobacco companies in the past spent a great deal of money to fund scientific research with the goal of mitigating or suppressing data linking smoking to health issues all to protect their revenue . We know the scientists they funded unironically came to the consensus that smoking wasn't really all that harmful and that they tenaciously defended their position for decades despite other scientists overwhelmingly claiming the reverse. This is just one example of precedence and for what I consider rather justified skepticism.

But NASA promoting the notion of "scientific consensus" makes them even more foolish, because science is *_never_* done by consensus. Saying what they do only makes them a *_political_* organization instead of a scientific one. "Scientific consensus" is an oxymoron. Dr. David Legates showed how Cook's study and its results were upside-down and wrong -- only 0.3% agreed with the original thesis. Many of the scientists who Cook included in the consensus disagreed with Cook's assessment of their papers. Zimmerman's paper was even worse. Out of nearly 10,000 scientists and several thousand who responded, she counted only something like 79 to achieve her 97%. Ironically, we live in an Ice Age and those lunatics are demonizing warmth. They're not going to have much fun when the next glacial period gets into full swing. And with the globalists pushing for Global Cooling measures, like Stratospheric Aerosol Injection, that next 90,000 years without summer could start in our lifetimes.

"Extremely likely" is how scientific conclusions work. Evolution is also "extremely likely" rather than a concrete fact that can never be changed. You're arguing based on your ignorance of the scientific method. Can you not see how biased you are due to your politics?

UghNVlTeqmdEJXgCoAEC.8V_I6mStYh_8W7ol5kV7Fx		3	2017-08-11 17:00:14	Jon Westrum	Agree with Jason. The science is not settled and this consensus argument is being shamefully used to try and shut down conversations instead of addressing the real issues with climate science and the AGW modeling. For most, the disagreement isn't whether there is ANY impact because that would be disingenuous. Of course there is going to be SOME impact. The disagreement is with the actual severity of impact attributed to human activity, the overall long term severity and the best approach to address it all. There is also considerable questioning of external factors potentially influencing/biasing the data and study findings that shouldn't be ignored. Those in the scientific community are not above or outside the pressures of such things as keeping their jobs or potentially losing funding if they publish anything that might question the validity of the climate models or data. The quote "To learn who rules over you, simply find out who you are not allowed to criticize" becomes surprisingly pertinent and applicable here when you look at what happens to any in (or out of) science who dare to publicly go against the approved narrative. Final thought: We need to go back to letting people's arguments fail on their own if the data doesn't support their claim. This current trend of cheap and lazy attempts to score some illusory debate "win" by trying to berate others into silence is beyond tired and getting us nowhere closer to any sort of agreement or reconciliation.

"Multiple studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals1 show that 97 percent or more of actively publishing climate scientists agree: Climate-warming trends over the past century are extremely likely due to human activities. In addition, most of the leading scientific organizations worldwide have issued public statements endorsing this position. The following is a partial list of these organizations, along with links to their published statements and a selection of related resources." This must be the only paragraph you read.

So when the decades, indeed centuries, of research becomes sooooooo strong that the vast majority of many different branches of science actually agree....across many different nations.....THAT IS AMAZINGLY STRONG Evidence about how STRONG THE RESEARCH HAS BECOME. THAT is the power of consensus...and still many of the brightest minds challenge and Question, and their studies have been added as FURTHER SUBSTANTIATION of the science of Global Warming causing threatening climate changes. We have MANY Satellites, each A-Moral and A-POLITICAL actually Observing and Measuring earth emissions of infra red thermal radiation being interrupted in the exact wavelengths of greenhouse gasses and disappearing from their trajectory to the cold of space. We have MANY Satellite, each A-Moral and A-POLITICAL actually Observing and Measuring INCREASING downward Infra Red Thermal Radiation toward Earth....more than ALL IR RADIATION COMING FROM SPACE...what accounts for that increase??

In point of fact, given the constantly challenging critical scientific community, it really points to the Mountainous Breadth and Depth of Research Results that have drowned out much opposition. Here is the science, every step of which has been Repeated and Mirrored by many other research studies. With the knowledge that Human Industry/Agriculture were PUMPING over 100 times MORE CO2 (working with H2O) & other Greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than all Earth's Volcanoes, combined. The World's Leading Scientific Minds & specifically, virtually all of NASA SCIENTISTS, They Challenged, They Questioned & They Critiqued the Effects of Greenhouse Gasses (specifically CO2/Water Vapor & their multiplier effect) on climate ! In 1970, NASA launched the IRIS/satellite that Observed & Measured in detail the Escaping Infra Red THERMAL Energy spectra between 400 cm-1 to 1600 cm-1. . ( Google:---------------> IRIS-Satellite Research) In 1996, the Japanese Space Agency launched the IMG/satellite which recorded similar observations. . (Google:---------------> IMG-Satellite Research) . Both sets of data were compared to discern any changes in escaping infra red thermal radiation over the 26 year period . (Google----------------> Harries Research Study, 2001). . They found a Dramatic DROP in Escaping (a drop in earth cooling ! !) Infra Red THERMAL Radiation at the Precise wavelength bands that greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) & methane (CH4) absorb energy ! While ESCAPING Infra Red THERMAL Radiation is DECREASING. . ------------------------------> Green House Gases were INCREASING ! (hand in glove) The change in ESCAPING I.R. THERMAL radiation is consistent with theoretical expectations & Global Warming Science Predictions since 1965. . Numerous Research Studies have found: -------------------------------> "direct experimental empirical evidence for a significant increase in the Earth's greenhouse effect"/GLOBAL Warming. . This result has been confirmed by NUMEROUS subsequent Research Studies using more recent satellite data, Digital Balloon Launches,etc.	UCt9UyYrv76HIRb_2mKix47g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt9UyYrv76HIRb_2mKix47g	1	UggvK8uDFNvdJ3gCoAEC	moresnare

Neither did they declare it was flat.The earth has periods of observable temperature variations. Unfortunately, there is no model which can predict this with accuracy into the future. Beware the person or scientist who states they are accurate. They are at best- educated guesses. The models being used by researchers cannot take into account enough variables to project an accurate estimate of temperature rise. The variables will be skewed. What most skeptics had a problem with is declarations of disaster and we need to dump billions into programs to prevent it or lessen the effects. Predicting temperature rise is a moving target. It will always be skewed. Now, as I always point out, we have many environmental issues which likely will cause us problems in the near future if not addressed. Most are clearly observable and the results or outcomes are predictable if not addressed. Wasting huge sums of money and resources on programs addressing global climate change, that is less than predictable, and by not funding environmental programs which address real concerns, we will seal our fate.

That the 97% is just plain inaccurate. That even if Global Warming was established, the larger question is "what is the real impact of that? Can we truly quantify the possible negative results?" Not really. Some say the "seas will rise several inches every 20 years." Don't you think human ingenuity and engineering skills can handle such a gradual rise. As far as potentially reaching the "point of no return in 10 years." That's just flat out wrong. And Al Gore himself has recently admitted such. Finally, "skeptical science" above, does not have a very favorable rating among scientists. It's highly biased, started by an Australian cartoonist.

Al Gore is not a scientist to begin with and he never said it was going to happen immediately anyway. His movie was pretty poor but that is what happens when you have to dumb it down for common people. The New American article is full of bullshit. It claims that there has been no warming since 1996, that is simply false. It claims that the IPCC models are dead wrong. They aren't. It's claiming that the polar ice caps are growing. They aren't. There have been some some positive accumulation in antarctica but the overall trend is negative.

"It’s easy to poke fun at these “failed predictions”—and many environmental skeptics do. Those critics aren’t entirely wrong; some of the era’s predictions were based on faulty logic. But others failed to come true because the predictions themselves changed the course of history." "And so on that first Earth Day, people fighting oil spills, power plant pollution, pesticides and litter protested in the streets. The government responded to public outcry, activism and the collective predictions of the era by creating our most powerful environmental laws—the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Endangered Species Act and others." "And the regulations have worked. After DDT was banned in 1972, populations of bald eagles and other birds rebounded. Regulations on nitrogen dioxide and particulate pollution have improved air quality in cities alongside children’s lung development. In the late 1970s, 88 percent of American children had elevated lead levels in their blood; after leaded gasoline was phased out, that number dropped to less than 1 percent."

UggvK8uDFNvdJ3gCoAEC.8VZJVO7jd_g8WbhpVkQBAC		2	2017-08-23 16:56:07	Joe D	The first article is about the frequent claim that scientists predicted global cooling in the 70s. The global cooling theory in the 70s was a minority view among scientists, but it was the theory the media chose to push the most. Newsweek is not a scientific paper. Their objective is to sell magazines. Here is an article that explains what happened: http://io9.gizmodo.com/reality-check-most-scientists-never-believed-in-globa-1617925806 "Researchers surveyed the peer-reviewed scientific literature published between 1965 and 1979. They found that 44 studies favored the theory of global warming, 20 studies were neutral and 7 studies supported the theory of global cooling. The divide was even more dramatic when tallying up the number of citations for the studies: articles that supported global warming had 2,043 citations compared to those on global cooling, which had 325... "But, while the consensus supported the view that our planet was warming, it was the speculation about global cooling that received disproportionate coverage in the mainstream press. The idea of the Earth reverting to its prehistoric past made for a great narrative and, in the late 1970s, the record cold winters provided a perfect story peg." As for the second article, I totally agree with the conclusion the author makes: "This is evident in the loudest parts of the climate change discussion. Extremists on one side are certain the world is going to end; extremists on the other are certain everything is fine and climate change is a conspiracy. The truth is more complicated. Climate change won’t destroy the planet, although it will change the environment we’re accustomed to, in ways we can't predict and with possibly dire consequences. And weaponizing “failed predictions” of the past to justify leaving the climate problem to the market is deceptive. If we don't act because a previous prediction "failed," we face an array of human suffering, which will hit the poorest and disadvantaged the hardest."

Even though you think this is new information, this is actually important information that climate scientists studied long before you pointed it out, and continue to study today. There are many factors that contribute to the Earth's temperature, and these variables keep the temperature relatively stable within a narrow range that can support life. But when an event triggers a sudden increase in greenhouse gases, it causes global warming, and these past hot houses have led to mass extinctions. Of course the Earth will survive another runaway global warming event, but we should be concerned about how humanity will deal with it, and if there is any way we can prevent it from happening.

Which dire predictions were said to take place in 2017? Please provide some evidence. When scientists are talking about dramatic effects of climate change they generally talk long term which will be visible in the 2050-2100 timeframe or beyond. Nobody said that the world is going to end in 2017. We are however beginning to see the effects of climate change already with melting ice caps and tundras and constant heat records but it's not very dramatic yet. Your argument is like "I once drove 150 mph on the highway without using the seat belt, that proves that speed limits and seat belt laws are useless".

Ancient philosophers understood the Earth was a sphere several hundred years BC, long before the scientific method was a thing. It wasn't a "science vs. skeptic" debate until recently. The flat earthers of today use the same "consensus is not science argument" that the global warming skeptics use. A better example is George McGovern's government guidelines on dietary fat and cholesterol, which led to the food pyramid that is still being pushed today. That government consensus was based on bad science, ignored competing theories, and, in my opinion, is directly responsible for the spike in obesity and type 2 diabetes over the past 40 years. I agree that science often gets things wrong. Science is simply about testing hypothesis, and the scientific method is the best means we have of eventually getting as close to the truth as we can. I also agree that when government agencies and powerful lobbying groups get involved to push an agenda, the scientific method often gets tossed and the science becomes politicized. However, in the case of global warming, the politicization is coming mostly from the skeptic side. If there is compelling evidence that the recent rise in global temperatures is caused by something other than the recent rise in CO2, what is the evidence? So far the prime suspect is CO2.

It is not fair to say that most global warming skeptics have admitted that human activity is the cause--that was the whole point of the video and the culmination of my own post. I would even go so far as to argue that the term "global warming skeptics" is a bit of a stretch itself as if there has been a distinct faction of people vehemently opposing a consistent, clear, indisputable, and obvious problem. The cause of environmental hysteria has been in constant state of fluctuation since the 1960s changing from overpopulation & starvation to global cooling to acid rain to climate change to global warming, the only constants being (a) the name changing after each crisis was found to be about as real as the Mayan apocalypse prediction, (b) the promotion of a particular left-leaning socio-political agenda that designed to fix these impending "disasters", and (c) the ostracizing of any public opposition to the agenda as being fools who should be ignored. Even if I ceded to your assertion that global warming is a man-made phenomenon rather than a natural one--*which is really what the debate is about rather than whether there is warming taking place at all*--for the sake of argument, what is your proposed solution? There are no alternative energy sources that can meet the current needs of western civilization so should we revert back to the pre-industrial age? Are you ready to give up your car or any means of transportation apart from cycling or walking to work (because animals emit greenhouse gasses too lest we be too hasty to replace cars with the horse and carriage), all of your electronic devices, any light sources that aren't solar powered, your mircowave, dishwasher, refrigerator and freezer? Why settle for a compromise of reducing our emissions only a little if this is really as big a problem as people claim? Shouldn't we stop everything outright to prevent the impending collapse of our planet? Why don't we start sterilizing people and getting rid of undesirables while we're at it too--you know, for the good of the planet since us humans are such a grievous and unnatural blight upon the earth. Considering the promotion of contraceptives, abortaficients, and euthanasia by the global warming alarmists, that reality is beginning to come to fruition. Should we be conscientious and do our best not to be wasteful of the resources we have been blessed with--yes, absolutely but that's really as far as we should take this. Even if everyone accepted that this was a real problem, there is no real practical solution to it. That being said, this global warming isn't an issue that keeps me up at night, though I am quite opposed to the alleged solutions often proposed to remedy it. If you have some alternatives to those usually peddled then, I'm open to listening.	UCsaX_aG2ZhJyi-SPDr4nHUg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsaX_aG2ZhJyi-SPDr4nHUg	1	UggvK8uDFNvdJ3gCoAEC	moresnare

UggvK8uDFNvdJ3gCoAEC.8VZJVO7jd_g8WA8cmuwkjj		1	2017-08-12 14:41:05	KyleOfCanada	Hi FDK , I partially agree with your comment. When scientists are commenting on facts that pertain properly to what the field of science was designed for, then yes their scientific consensus has meaning, such as in your example of the consensus on the car being green--this is a material phenomenon that we can objectively observe and draw conclusions about. The problem arises however when scientists go beyond their objective observations and give an opinion on a question that science was not intended to answer, such as: "89% of scientists agree that green cars are the best mode of transportation." This happens far too often and the distinction is not made by most. Science as a field was designed to help us understand the material world around us through objective observations, i.e. experiments and the scientific method (as I'm sure you well know). When scientists give opinions on questions that are abstract, subjective, or cannot be observed directly through the scientific method (such as interpreting what happened in the distant past or predicting what will happen in the future, or stating how one must respond to the facts they have observed), then their consensus is objectively speaking unscientific and little more than a philosophical/historical/social/political opinion without their realizing it. I think that the conservative reporter was trying to make this distinction clear in the video too. When one of the interviewees stated that there was a 97% consensus among scientists that the earth has been getting warmer on the whole (objective observable fact), but then went on to state that there was no consensus among scientists about whether or not this would be harmful to people (subjective opinion that cannot be objectively observed using the scientific method but must be predicted using potentially problematic models based on complex data). Notice however that the politicians he highlighted were all pushing an agenda by taking the 97% statistic out of context, failing to make this distinction clear, i.e. consensus on observable facts vs. lack of consensus on how to respond to it. That's my two cents anyways. All the best, Kyle	UCsaX_aG2ZhJyi-SPDr4nHUg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsaX_aG2ZhJyi-SPDr4nHUg	1	UggvK8uDFNvdJ3gCoAEC	moresnare

When people conclude that facts are what they are they have to end up with consensus. If a car is green and people observing the car notes the fact that yes it is indeed green then that is a consensus. "Scientific consensus" is not an oxymoron.

Of course He won&#39;t waste His time with you because He created the atmosphere of earth in the first place and He didn&#39;t consult with any scientists to do so. God reserves the right to control the climate, therefore He has taken that control out of man&#39;s hands altogether. We have absolutely no affect on whether the climate rises in overall temperature or falls in overall temperature. God caused the great flood of Noah&#39;s day and then when it was all over, He promised never to destroy the earth with a flood again. Get it through your thick heads, &quot;In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth.&quot;	UChi1dM4ZTA0N6EyurcykmJg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UChi1dM4ZTA0N6EyurcykmJg	0

So how can you say that you know exactly how warm it was then and more so, how warm it is supposed to be now? Yes climate is changing. Yes, it is warmer now than it was at points in the past. But how are we to know what to do and not do about it now? Who&#39;s to say this warming doesn&#39;t end up being good for mankind in some way we don&#39;t currently understand? What if we get hit by a comet, or a large number of volcanoes spew ash into the atmosphere? Wouldn&#39;t you be happy to learn that the, if actually true, all that &quot;global warming&quot; we were worried about is actually just what we needed cause not the ice age caused by the [Fill in the blank global disaster] won&#39;t be as bad.<br />Let&#39;s worry about the starving, diseased and under educated masses before we start committing trillions to make sure the average temperature around the world only goes up 0.2 degrees over the next 100 years instead of 0.4 degrees.

Population growth is a bigger problem, I think, and the more people we have the more pollution we are likely to have. Add to that most of the people on the planet aspiring to achieve the spoiled lifestyle of NA. By all means develop environmentally friendly energy technologies, but don&#39;t ask people to suffer as a result without proof that it will help. Global warming and cooling has been going on for millenia. We cannot say with certainty that it is occurring now because of our lifestyle. The study period is too short. CO2 levels were up to 11 times higher during the Triassic Period. If we have to change, we will, but give us the proof before you ask us to suffer.

He speaks as someone with little understanding of science. He uses anecdotal comments that do not help his case. Climate has been occurring and will keep occurring. If you deny that simple fact, you&#39;re either lying or you&#39;re just ignorant of the facts. We can, however, debate as to what you think the cause is... as long as you come with facts. The rock record indicates that CO2 levels have been MUCH higher in the geologic past, along with temperatures. They&#39;ve both also been far lower. As to whether this increase over the last 100 is unprecedented, scientists can only guess. Sure, we can use proxies in ice cores and go back 800,000 years, at most. However, the earth is far older. The rock record isn&#39;t nearly as easy to tease out rates of increase on such small temporal scales.<br /><br />My main gripe is that both climate alarmists and skeptics are generally poorly informed or completely uninformed, knowing only what they see in pieces like this one, on CNN, etc.<br /><br />I&#39;m far more concerned by polluting of waterways.

Scott Strough, Researcher in carbon farming as a climate change mitigation strategy ** "There is no need to add additional taxes to combat climate change. The best bet is simply quit subsidizing those things causing AGW. ((world wide, Fossil Fuels & connected industries TAKE 6.5% of GDP ..TRILLIONS in subsidies/ supports))) . In most cases the newer more modern energy and agricultural systems are more profitable and less damaging to the environment already. So there is no need to tax people to subsidize those things harming the environment, then taxing us again to penalize those same ones we just subsidized! A house divided against itself cannot stand. -Lincoln (paraphrasing the Bible) It is time for a strong political leader to take charge and end this deadlock. We could either reduce taxes and let the new technologies out compete the obsolete systems we depend on now, or we could keep taxes the same and simply redirect the subsidies we use for fossil fuels and destructive industrialized agriculture towards modern sustainable systems instead. The one thing that won’t work is keep the tax and spend schemes the Neo-Luddites have made for themselves now, and also add even more tax and spend schemes for their competing new technologies too! Yes that’s right, the top two causes for global warming are heavily subsidized.[1][2][3][4] It is literally insanity. in·san·i·ty in'san?de/ noun the state of being seriously mentally ill; extreme foolishness or irrationality. We can reverse AGW though, and save money doing it. Here are three proposals. One made by me and two more similar ones. Here you can see how some might include a carbon market and ways we could do it without a carbon market. They are all workable. The main thing is that they are all stand alone solutions that have beneficial sides effects instead of detrimental side effects to the land and society. We should do them even if AGW wasn’t real. They would still be hugely beneficial all around. There is no negative down side. Win/win for all. Credit: Joel Pett | USA Today 1] Scott Strough's answer to Can we reverse global warming? Executive summary: Yes we can reverse Global Warming. It does not require huge tax increases or overly expensive untested risky technologies. It will require a three pronged approach worldwide. 1] Reduce fossil fuel use by replacing energy needs with as many feasible renewables as current technology allows. . ((solar & wind Cost less & are quicker to construct + + they produce FAR less expensive electricity than coal)) . Change Agricultural methods to high yielding regenerative models of production made possible by recent biological & agricultural science advancements. Large scale ecosystem recovery projects similar to the Loess Plateau project, National Parks like Yellowstone etc. where appropriate and applicable. 2] Project Drawdown The list is comprised primarily of “no regrets” solutions—actions that make sense to take regardless of their climate impact since they have intrinsic benefits to communities and economies. These initiatives improve lives, create jobs, restore the environment, enhance security, generate resilience, and advance human health.[5] 3] Farming a climate change solution Farmers have a golden solution to global warming largely missed by climate change pundits, right beneath their feet. The innovative Australian Soil Carbon Accreditation Scheme is showing how incentive payments can be received by landholders for measurable increases in soil carbon that soaks up CO2 from the atmosphere. Financial incentives could help fund soil restoration efforts, which in turn bring the bonus of greater productivity, drought resilience and even rain. The action is deep underground.[6] Footnotes [1] The $200 Billion Fossil Fuel Subsidy You've Never Heard Of (USA) [2] Fossil fuel subsidies are a staggering $5 tn per year | John Abraham [3] Fossil Fuel Subsidies Top $450 Billion Annually, Study Says (USA w various costs,supports) [4] Milking taxpayers [5] Solutions | Drawdown [6] http://www.amazingcarbon.com/PDF...

The record of the alarmists over those years is abysmal. I do not deny that the activities of mankind have environmental consequences including climate. I do deny that those consequences are significant---they are probably not even measurable. Yes in general temperature and CO2 concentration have essentially tracked each other. However, even Al Gore's graphs from Inconvenient Truth, when laid on top of each other showed that temperature changed, CO2 concentration changed some time later. A real problem for postulating that CO2 concentration causes temperature change! "Could it be that the warmer temperatures increased the co2? If so, why? And what then caused the temperatures to increase?" Excellent questions! Yes, it could be, and likely is, that the causal relationship is that temperature change drives CO2 concentration and not the other way around. Strong evidence for that being just the case. You 3rd question is the most important one that we don't know the answer to. Lots of guesses but no plausible theories. I also agree with you that quite a few scientists believe that we should be getting colder not hotter right now. Of course you think my mind is made up on this issue. It is not, I am open to evidence but not to junk science in support of an agenda.

Heat records are constantly being broken while very few cold records are. The average global temperature has in fact increased. Throughout Earth's history, when temperatures increased, the co2 levels were increasing, as well. Could it be that the warmer temperatures increased the co2? If so, why? And what then caused the temperatures to increase? Co2 is currently being pumped into the atmosphere at a rate unmatched at any time in the past. The temperatures are going up. The Earth should be getting cooler right now, but it's not. This is fact. Tens of thousands of scientists are studying the climate and have reached the consensus(yes, it's an opinion albeit an educated one). You can see the effects everywhere. I'm going with the real scientists on this rather than the conspiracy theorists. Obviously, your mind is made up, regardless of the evidence around you. We'll see how you feel in 10-20 years...

Ugin61Lf54SMg3gCoAEC.8V7j2857Pon8kVVVgBHi7u		0	2018-08-28 17:35:55	Bill Leach	Afternoon Dreamer, Again, in the laboratory chamber, CO2 and methane do behave as 'greenhouse' gases. In the laboratory chamber haides to convert ozone. I'm going to take the halides first... Freon is a VERY heavy gas. It is so heavy that it acts more like a liquid than a gas. You can fill a beaker with freon and absent strong air currents and significant thermal cycles, the beaker will remain full of freon. Try that with other gases, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, argon, etc. and in a short time the contents of the beaker will be the same as the surrounding environment. The foregoing is vitally important in order to understand why the claim that freon was causing a loss of ozone. With respect to the infamous 'hole' over Antarctica there are multiple problems. First is that the hole was first discovered in 1956. Many years prior to the huge production, much less release into the environment, of freon that was to eventually occur. Almost 100% of the freon was also only in the northern hemisphere. Second there is no known physical mechanism available to move the man made halogen (freon in this discussion) from the Earth's surface to the upper atmosphere. Third there is an active volcano directly under the hole. The plumes from this volcano have been tracked into the region of the hole. Fourth it is also known that solar and cosmic radiation both play a part in ozone concentration at the pole (the hole is located at the earth's southern magnetic pole). The NASA funding scare about ozone depletion over US because of freon was a blatant lie. This was the year following the Mount St. Helen's eruption. The reduction in ozone concentration was exactly what the volcanists had predicted would result from that event. Oh yes, the predictions on global warming are significantly greater than they were years ago. When I was a kid some of these same 'scientists' were predicting that we were entering a new ice age! I agree that scientists are learning more about climate physics all the time. I violently disagree that this learning is proving anthropogenic global warming. Finally, your (borrowed) statement that the debate is over is ONLY an indication that your are climate change religious believer and have little to no understand of how science is supposed to operate. Do you realize that one of the most fundamental axioms of physics is, and has been, in debate for decades? C, the speed of light is considered to be a constant (300,000,000 meters/second). However, the idea that it is a constant is NOT settled. We do have evidence that suggests that the speed of light varies. In fact Einstein's own theory provides the suggestion that it is not constant (something he denied). Questioning anthropogenic climate change and seriousness of possible contributions if it does exist is not in anyway similar to the stupid talking point that claims not being a climate change alarmist is like being a 'flat Earther.' One looks silly when one uses emotional arguments and resorts to claims of higher authority rather than debating known facts.

It is also widely known that global warming is much worse than was predicted years ago. Scientists are well aware of how complex climate is and they are constantly learning more and the more they learn, the more it reenforces the fact that humans are causing global warming now. Again, I'm with the scientists on this. It's pretty clear that the scientists know what they are talking about. It's no longer a debate. It's reality. Arguing otherwise is like saying the earth is flat. You just look silly.

Ugin61Lf54SMg3gCoAEC.8V7j2857Pon8kVIoQGSliy		0	2018-08-28 15:45:01	Bill Leach	Afternoon Dreamer, claiming that CO2 and methane are 'greenhouse' gases is similar to claiming that halides (freon) destroys ozone. In the lab, all of the foregoing is true. However, outside of the lab, especially globally such may not be the case. It is on the shoulders of those making the claims to prove those claims and this has not been achieved. Environmental science is a semi-soft science in that for most environmental science hypothesis there is no means for applying the principles of science to prove or disprove the assertion. A vastly different situation from a field such a physics. Einstein's special hypothesis of relativity made a prediction that could be, and more importantly was, verified by independent researchers. The special hypothesis of relativity then became the special THEORY of relativity. Even for that, one of the most famous assertions in the history of science, researchers continue to come up with additional ways to confirm or disprove the theory. Lacking that independent confirmation, environmental science is essentially little more that opinion and thus NOT science at all. The real difficulty is that environmental science is hugely complex. Proving a relationship exists between one or more factors affecting global temperature does not prove any causation at all. Even the correlation between CO2 concentration and global temperature is solid. Finally, other than the STATEMENT that the world does appear to warming slightly, absolutely NONE of the predictions have been even remotely close to what has actually occurred. In all case the predictions have wildly over-stated what has actually occurred.

While he was in D.C., he would instruct his house staff, back here in Tennessee, to keep all the lights on all the time so that it would look like someone was there all of the time. But he and his family were hardly ever here. So now he preaches to "do as I say, not what I do" and makes millions doing so. So much, that he has bought an even bigger house with an even bigger carbon footprint, in California no less, and he's never there either. He's out flying around in a private jet.

Don't you think it's strange that everyone who disagrees with these scientists are celebrities, politicians, talk show hosts, tv personalities, etc.? Do those people really get a say in the matter? To say that there is not absolute agreement that it's dangerous may be true to some extent, but in models where it is dangerous, it may be virtually irreversible. We don't have the technology to reverse it before disaster, if indeed disaster lies ahead, unless we start early. if the icecaps melt it not only causes oceans to rise, it changes the reflectivity of the earth as a whole, intensifying the effect; feeding back on itself, possibly causing changes in the ocean, which MAY have contributed to the many extinctions in the past. Stossel's argument is that these things happen naturally, but you know what we know for a fact has happened naturally many times (at least 5 times)? Mass extinction caused by catastrophic global changes.

In Central America where I live part time we did not have a refuse problem until the cans and jars came in from the USA. Sell products in plastic bags that can be converted back into oil from whence they came. Sell wine/beer/in containers other than glass...bags? If glass must be used, make them refillable! Easy easy, and cheaper for the consumer. If poisons and weed killers are used, make a one hole depository for the residue on the property. With organic matter, make a compost depository on the property. That way people are responsible for their own waste, not all of us responsible for everyone else. If everyone believes we all much be 'our brother's keeper' that means we are in to our brother's business, so have brother responsible for his own events. The larger items are more difficult. Anyone have any ideas on that? In OR we have a place where such things can be deposited, received by the manufacturer, recycled that which can recycle, and destroy the rest. Extra price for the equipment (computer, refrigerator, stove, micro, etc) is covered in the purchase contract.) Go back to making appliances as they were made in the '40's and '50's, and some in the 60's where the appliance was good for at least 30 years. Quit being a throw-away society. I have a Maytag dishwasher that I installed new in my place in 1980. Still works beautifully, so it can be done! Not meaning to plug Maytag, but they do make long lasting, as near maintenance free as possible, so that's one consideration. Appliances out of the Netherlands may do the same, so if US wants to keep its business, make it a priority to have them manufacture applances that LAST A LONG TIME. Ppl need to quit being trendy by showing off the latest gimmick. Get responsible instead.

Sure, they want you to think the Big Oil companies are against the "climate change" movement, but actually their owners started it. And the more people they fool (like you and I) into believing their hoax, the more power they gain. They don't want a consumer economy; they want a feudalistic economy, where you and I are slaves, if they allow us to live. What toxic side effects? CO2 is dangerously close to CO2 Mass Extinction (150 ppm), and NASA set their maximum recommended CO2 level (up to an hour) for their spacecraft at 20,000 ppm (50x today's level). There's real pollution and the evil, publicly traded corporations love to dump all their junk into the environment -- things like atrazine, glyphosate, petroleum sludge and the like. But CO2 was never and is not now a pollutant.

And I'm not saying these are equivalent arguments, I'm saying the principle is the same. If something is a universal principle, in this case the "appeal to consequences" fallacy, then it applies to all arguments. Saying we should do X because some climate scientists predict something bad if we don't is no different *in principle* then claiming you should believe in God because if you don't something bad might happen. You're trying to argue that the subject changes the principle. If that's the case then the principle is not universal, i.e. saying we should do X because the consequences might be bad is a fallacy sometimes - at which point you've left the realm of logic, my friend, and now you're in the arbitrary wonderland of feelings and preference. I also can't help but notice you ignored your other inconsistency concerning funding. I'm not saying any of this disproves AGWT, I'm just pointing out that it was a bad argument on your part, and you're kinda missing the point. Not a big deal, we all say stuff sometimes without thinking it through all the way.

They needed a vehicle for their lies so they could, 1) Gain more money, 2) Gain more power, and 3) Take over the planet (New World Order, style). The Biggest Oil Rockefellers were amongst the initial group to create the "climate change" hoax. They're avowed eugenicists. They want to kill off the vast majority of the human race, and keep the Earth's resources to themselves. Being environmentally friendly, plus economically prudent would cause vast prosperity for everyone on the planet interested in achieving it. Psychopaths don't want other people to be prosperous and powerful. That scares them. They want other psychopaths to be powerful, but only so long as they have evidence to hang over their mutual heads. Could that be why Bill Gates started his Foundation and got interested in vaccines and GMOs, because his trial with the US government was going badly? Did they use that to coerce him into playing along with the NWO new deal? The more I learn about psychopaths, the more interesting this game becomes. But also, the more clear it becomes that the psychopaths will lose in the end. They're operating from a position of weakness -- self-concern (ego). Only those who have given up self-concern will win in the end. Christ called them the "meek."

Real facts? 1) I'm not lying and you have no way of backing that claim. Therefor it is merely an opinion and accusation. 2) The claim that the East Anglia University changed the data has been widely debunked and still does not change the overall scientific consensus. "Climategate" as it was called, turned out to be nothing more than a desperate attempt at denial.

You also seem to be a bit confused. it was You who said We have cleaned up our act. Here's the copy and paste " I say we HAVE cleaned up our act." If wind and solar should compete on an equal basis then guess what? They get the same "tax credits and refunds" as the existing corporations. Apart from the Western European Nordic countries and perhaps Germany, China is forging ahead with Renewables faster than everyone. India recently cancelled coal contracts in favour of solar fields as well. You say "Climate frauds are NOT scientists. Well I say scientists are not 'Climate frauds'. Who's paying these people to corrupt this data? Why? They didn't need to say anything and if it is such a huge lie, then thousands of scientists have their careers ruined. For what? A few extra dollars? Do you know why there is a pause? The polar caps are melting at an incredible rate. Last I looked, this cools the water and creates cooler atmosphere in some areas. CO2 is a greenhouse gas and traps heat. Primary school will teach you that. There is little doubt that anthropogenic Climate Change is happening anymore in the Science community, only the severity of it's effects. As a relevant scientist, you should already know this. The Great Barrier Reef of the North East of Australia is bleaching due to a rise in temperature of the ocean. A number of other reefs have also suffered similiar effects. The evidence points toward Anthropogenic Climate Change. I don't have to lie. I don't Want it to happen. One possible story of hope, is that worldwide, plants seem to be growing better due to the increased CO2 in the atmosphere, and it is thought they their increased intake may help to balance things. So there was more CO2 in the atmosphere about 541 million years ago. Life, animals and plants were also very different. Most of those species have become extinct so it's really not comparable. I'm 'man' enough to admit when I'm wrong and in this case I would like to be, but for now I'll go with the weight of evidence and not with a so called scam that would be almost impossible to create and fund for all but the largest corporations, which are often fossil fuel companies. Yeah, they will happily slit their own throats for no reason. It's also too big to keep secret. https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/	UCvoDORg1-uwX-XyHTlTSniQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvoDORg1-uwX-XyHTlTSniQ	1	Ugiw-be0UbA2zHgCoAEC	FTFActual
Ugiw-be0UbA2zHgCoAEC.8UsiSa-bRC_8caKl1UTnng		0	2018-02-13 03:46:19	Larry Tischler	Doc Carter I was making the point before. You chose to ignore it. The Left is ALWAYS LYING and is therefore EVIL. The shift to renewables is not a win if it is not made on economic bases. These tax credits and refunds need to stop for this stuff, today. Let wind and solar compete on an equal basis. Period. And NO you have NOT CLEANED UP YOUR ACT. China and the rest of the world's big polluters are given a free pass. So You LIED on that too. The EPA did not act in the interests of the people of this country. If they did, Dearborn's water would not be polluted. The Animas River in Colorado would not have been polluted by them in their failed attempt to frame the mining industry. They deserved to be shut down. And all real Americans need to stand up and cheer that these criminals are not killing jobs today. Climate frauds are NOT scientists. They have an agenda. If they report the truth, their pay check stops. And it is Gullible Alarming, not global warming. Yes any excess CO2 is precipitated out in warm oceans as carbonate. That process has been going on in the fossil record in Texas for 1100 to 1400 million years. And you are LYING about the other planets not warming when the earth was warming. They may well be cooling today. And NO, the temperature of the Gulf of Mexico going from 86 deg F to 95 deg for ten years was not just weather, it was world wide, but now, it is back down, near to historic norms. If it had not cooled, hurricane Katrina would have killed many thousands in New Orleans in 2005. When I first heard about the CO2 vs temperature scare I was shocked that they could try to peddle that crap. I am a real scientist, and have analyzed enough sea water samples studying acid gas removal to know that could never happen. So I found out that one of the first proponents of this scam was Roger Revelle, idiot LIAR Algore's mentor at Harvard. During those days they put his data on the internet for all to see. One thing they did not release however was his number he used to predict the amount of CO2 actually adsorbed. The number is called the partition coefficient. And from his conclusions, it was obvious that he used the wrong number. He was using the number for room temperature sea water at rest, when the real world numbers should be that of a counter current extractor, using icy sea water at high latitudes were the waves continuously break and the foam gives huge contact. Such a system is nearly perfectly efficient in CO2 removal. This is the answer to the condition the climate scammers say is the so called "pause". It is not a pause at all. It "AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN". CO2 can not build up in todays oceans that convert so much CO2 to O2 and take out the rest as carbonates in the warm subtropical and tropical regions. BTW, when these processes started, the atmosphere was largely CO2. As proven by the high iron content in the banded iron deposits in some Proterozoic rocks. So please quit LYING. Climate change the left preaches is a hoax. You were caught at East Anglea fudging the data. Be a man and admit it.

Ugiw-be0UbA2zHgCoAEC.8UsiSa-bRC_8ca6voAgtls		0	2018-02-13 01:45:27	Doc Carter	Larry Tischler- Oh. Now you have a point. We are in the Process of cleaning up our act. Take a look at the Worldwide shift from fossil fuels to Renewables. The only 'Economic Shutdown' was done/caused by the heavily deregulated Central Banks, betting on outcomes that were never going to work, with other people's money. Scientists, using predictive computer models and data from core ice samples predicted the trend of Climate change over the last 400,000+ years and everytime found a sudden and unprecedented rise in overall climate temperature. Scientists not "leftists". Again. if we truly clean up our act, meaning a move toward renewables and leaving behind fossil fuels, then Clearly, we will have world better able to support life. This is an undeniable fact. So no matter what happens about Climate Change, it's still a Win. We are not talking about simple weather temperature measurements over the last 20 years, (which the deniers love to centre on because it is the only cherry picked data that is of any help to them). The data acquired is measured of a few hundred thousand years. The Great Barrier Reef amongst other reefs is being bleached (killed) by a general rise in ocean temperature. I suppose those evil Leftists are responsible for that. The planets are generally cooling, at least in our solar system. But we are heating. Given your remarks, I'm fairly sure you don't understand what Global Warming is.	UCvoDORg1-uwX-XyHTlTSniQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvoDORg1-uwX-XyHTlTSniQ	1	Ugiw-be0UbA2zHgCoAEC	FTFActual

And the leftist were NOT interested in the environment but interested in shutting down our economy. Which they did in earnest. Otherwise they would go after the real polluters. And they would not have put together the climate warming data they did, in which they changed the data base to exaggerate the change. And you are LYING about the 'scientific evidence". They changed the data base means they compared old, northern stations which have now been shut down, with newer equatorial stations. It is NOT A WIN to use a fake solution to a problem that does not exist. Or at least is not near the problem you claim to exist. Unless your goal is to destroy America's economy, which is a proven goal of the left. Anyway, the temp has not gone up much if any since '97. The Gulf of Mexico is running almost ten deg cooler than it did then. And answer this, did fossil fuel CO2 cause the other planets to heat up back then? You can't. You are a climate fraud. And the only thing constant about climate is change.	UCEgPyfG_4rk0ISpBPKAtguQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEgPyfG_4rk0ISpBPKAtguQ	1	Ugiw-be0UbA2zHgCoAEC	FTFActual

That's an expensive and stupid thing to do if we didn't have a problem with fossil fuel burning. Our Climate temperature is rising and yes, there is a lot of evidence to support this. I also don't think it's a coincidence that America's Trump government is turning away from all environmental protections and also giving more power and access to oil companies etc on previously protected land. If this Global Climate Change is just a scam, then why would oil interests admit it. They stand to lose a shit load of money if everyone gets on the bandwagon. The Great Barrier Reef is severe jeopardy of dying altogether with massive bleaching caused by warming oceans. But no no, it's all a pointless scam by scientists who risk their careers for almost no reason. Oh. Hold on. The Oil and Coal companies are 'Paying' the scientists to try and shut them down.

Do you know how much volcanoes are changing the climate vs humans? Considering most of the NATO "scientists" also said we would be in an ice age right now 30 years ago means there's an agenda to it. Do you know what that agenda is? It's called government grants. Yes, they have to agree with a government to a high degree to get a giant grant to aid in research. Most of that money is now being funneled into geoengineering for various reasons from the scifi weather control, to creating a "mirror" via alumina particulates to block UV rays, to trying to increase rainfall in arid regions like california.

CO2 is NOT glass. We&#39;re not going to get that much increase in temperature.<br />We could double CO2 to mid-starvation levels of 800 ppm (today&#39;s is 400 ppm), and we&#39;d get about +1C of warming globally. ALERT: +1C of warming is not a lot. One-tenth of a degree will likely go to the tropics; two-tenths to the deserts; half a degree to the temperate zone (contiguous United States); and a little over +2C to the poles. Scorching? Nothing like the &quot;hot car&quot; effect.<br />If we were to return to CO2 Normal -- 1,600 ppm (4x today) -- we&#39;d have a global warming of roughly +2C globally. It wouldn&#39;t be enough to knock us out of the current Ice Age, but it&#39;d be a good start. Life thrives in warmth. Just look at the population gradient from poles to equator.<br />End the damned Ice Age and sea levels will be about 210 feet higher! But life will thrive in the warmth. The Sahara might be green again (like it was during the far warmer Holocene Optimum). Most deserts will shrink. But life cannot survive well if we cool the planet from our already cold interglacial.

But liberals show a total lack of wisdom when they don&#39;t spend more time and effort into fact checking and objectively weighing the evidence to try and make sure they are right before they take a position on a subject , what is telling is how easily the left is directed by their leaders , all they have to do is release some talking points and the rank and file liberals immediately start to parrot them as they attack and deny every attempt by reasonable people to present them with the facts that demonstrate how the liberals positions are not holding up to truth and logic, we all witness how the liberals will deny hard facts without and due consideration, just as they will with this post and any other post that does not comply with their claims, i just wish they were observant enough to see how slimy and pathetic they are when they are putting us in our place, or so they believe , sometimes they make theirself appear so ignorant and don&#39;t have a clue about it, they puff each other up as they scream and laugh about Faux news while being totally manipulated by their own liberal news, actually Fox is the most accurate news reporting out there, but try and convince a liberal of that and it won&#39;t happen.the raw truth of this is represented in the way liberals have been systematically voted out of political office in a 10 year long trend, but most liberals don&#39;t even know that because their news sources have kept that information from them, the only place they hear that from is us and they think we are being lied to by Fox,	UCs1efHel-6Z6qiKD_aQL_-Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs1efHel-6Z6qiKD_aQL_-Q	0

The rest of the planet is hardly affected at all. Climate always changes and most changes create problems. Global cooling in an Ice Age will create far more problems. Life prefers warmth; not ice. And our oceans will protect Earth from warming up too much. More warmth means more evaporation, more clouds and more sunlight reflected away from the planet, thus cooling the planet down. The oceans are our temperature regulator. No worries. Just adapt to the changes that come and pray that we continue to get more warming to end the current Ice Age. Otherwise, we could end up with 90,000 years without summers, near zero crops, and very little rain.	UCuhhX9p8cfLJTP5m5lm6z6Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuhhX9p8cfLJTP5m5lm6z6Q	0

Were you late for a hot date, or were you merely too lazy to take the time to name one specific instance of a lack of logic? Let's take one item -- our *_current Ice Age._* What's illogical about that? There is ice at both polar regions that persists throughout the year -- the key definition of Ice Age. We also have the name of our current period -- Holocene, which is an interglacial. And interglacial periods are an integral part of an Ice Age. This Ice Age has had dozens of interglacials and glacials in it's short, 2.6 million years. Oops! So, either you were being too lazy to think straight, or you were too lazy to share your "earth-shattering" logic with us mere mortals. How about getting off your lazy butt and share what you know? Otherwise, retract your empty, nonsensical claim (if your ego isn't too strong), because I just proved you wrong. But don't worry. I won't rub it in.

The 1st graph shows a sudden and massive spike in CO2 levels. Doesn't take a genius to figure that one out. This graph is an example of hundreds. Given the basic Scientific Method, taking multiple factors into account, it becomes the most accurate measurement and prediction that humanity has. For now, despite the obvious minor discrepancies and outliers present in every single scientific experiment ever, it is the only 'accurate' information we have. There is no such thing as "Scientism". Just. Don't bother please. I did not say that CO2 is "THE climate forcing" (I guess factor comes after that?). I said it was a major element. Again; read what is being said, not what you would like to be said. Fossil fuels and the obvious damage their use is doing to the environment will kill us. If you care about the economy and refuse the use of renewable sources based on the old arguments of cost effectiveness and how they initially use fossil fuels to get started, then try to breathe, drink and eat money. See how long you last for. You name drop. You provide .org articles. Now try research. The thing is, the sad thing is, that eventually, no matter what happens short of humanity's extinction, we will eventually have to turn to renewables. It is inevitable. Why cling to energy sources that are destroying life on the planet when there are obvious alternatives? That this isn't obvious to everyone is fucking mind blowing.

Ugi550tyQywGpXgCoAEC.8Rs6EgV9quy8XCmZflzTF4		1	2017-09-07 11:48:39	Kevin Naranek	Doc Carter: Where is the temperature in your 400,000 graph? If Co2 was THE forcing for temperature and you could so reliably show the level of it without error bars, why wouldn't you show how it changed the temperature. Another point - Every measurement comes with a level of uncertainty. Where are the error bars? The smaller the sample the greater the level of uncertainty and the sample size available for 400,000 years ago are limited to where other than Greenland and Antarctica? Two links about small sample size one from Neuroscience and the other from nuclear science. Climate is no different where sample size is concerned: http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v14/n5/full/nrn3475.html http://prod.sandia.gov/techlib/access-control.cgi/2010/100550.pdf Here is a link to a NOAA graph of global mean temperature - http://www.ucar.edu/news/features/climatechange/images/global-jan-dec-error-bar-pg.gif Note the error bars are generally larger than the amount of temperature change reported from year to year. What you don't show in an argument is just as important and perhaps even more so than what you do show. The debate over whether cold water can contain more gases than warm water is long over. As the oceans cooled at the beginning of Ice Ages more CO2 left the atmosphere only to return to the atmosphere 600 to 800 years after the beginning of Inter-glacial periods. That is why CO2 levels changed and not why Glacial and Interglacial periods occur. As for the section of your link claiming a massive change in storm intensity in the last 50 years. That doesn't mean anything unless you can show there has never been such a change given the then existing portion of the climate cycles of the past. YOU CAN'T! Climate is not just one static process only to be changed if atmospheric CO2 levels change. Many cylces impact climate. Milankovitch Cycles consists of three separate processes which each occur over separate lengths of time. The Pacific and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillations have significant effects on climate. They occur over different time lengths and climate models have been unable to model them with any accuracy. Both of these have been in the same portion of their cycles recently greatly impacting Arctic melting. Our ability to determine the temperature of the past with any accuracy decreases the further into the past you look. James Hansen has said that decline starts to occur at about 400 years ago. So when you see a greater temperature or weather change over the last 50 years than you have recorded before and you period of measurement is of a relatively short period of time as we have records, what can you justifiably conclude other than you don't have enough evidence. But that isn't going to make us rock stars of science is it when we can emulate Chicken Little. http://retractionwatch.com/2014/03/03/nobel-prize-winner-calls-peer-review-very-distorted-completely-corrupt-and-simply-a-regression-to-the-mean/ CO2 Greenhouse theory rests on work done in the 19th century and accepted for the most part since with some degree of speculative generalization. A recent paper compared the results of temperature when exposed to IR on a tube of CO2 and one containing just air and found no special temperature effect from CO2. https://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/a-novel-investigation-about-the-thermal-behaviour-of-gases-under-theinfluence-of-irradiation-a-further-argument-against-the-greenh-2157-7617-1000393.pdf The scientific method works by coming up with an hypothesis and testing it through empirical experiment to determine whether your hypothesis is correct . . . whether what you believed would happen actually happened. One of the things which CO2 warming theory predicts is that there would be a great deal of warming in the middle troposphere of the earth in the tropics where large amounts of water vapor exist in the atmosphere and the sun's energy strikes the earth in the greatest concentration. Scientific Instruments have been unable to detect anywhere near the level of temperature predicted by "theory" in the middle troposphere of the tropics. What the theory predicts has not been observed. THE KEY TO SCIENCE: Richard Feynman "In general, we look for a new law by the following process: First we guess it; then we compute the consequences of the guess to see what would be implied if this law that we guessed is right; then we compare the result of the computation to nature, with experiment or experience, compare it directly with observation, to see if it works. If it disagrees with experiment, it is wrong. In that simple statement is the key to science. It does not make any difference how beautiful your guess is, it does not make any difference how smart you are, who made the guess, or what his name is — if it disagrees with experiment, it is wrong." Climate models are based on simplified expressions of processes that in a number of cases are not well understood. For example clouds. There has been almost no improvement in the ability of models to model clouds in decades. A decrease in cloud cover could account for much of the change in temperature in recent decades. This has in fact been suggested by some research. The size of the grids used in climate models aren't even up to the task. Clouds and where they are located in the atmosphere can either trap or prevent energy from escaping. I think you may be an adherent of scientism. I am not saying CO2 has no effect on climate. But I am saying that the certainty of CO2 being THE climate forcing and how much is less certain than claimed. The response of the rest of the climate system to such is not well understood. Heck! parts of it are not well understood when CO2 levels are constant. The history of science contains too many examples of some proposition being commonly and widely accepted only to be proven by a single researcher or a new generation of scientists to be completely wrong. Alfred Wegener's being proven correct about plate tectonics. . . Marshall and Warren on peptic ulcers. . . What it would take to reverse CO2 levels in this century would require such a monumental re-engineering of the entire economic and social life of the world is not something I want to entertain. Anyway, as I was suggesting in my earlier comment about "The Tragedy of the Commons", fossil fuels are going to be with us for some time. The world need for energy is only going to increase in the future and current alternative energy tech isn't going to meet the need, especially if you take nuclear energy off the table as Germany did after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. ""massive spike in Climate Change" My you exaggerate! You want to see massive climate change go look up Daansgard-Oeschger events. Go look at how quickly sea-levels rose when the last Ice Age ended. You have no fricking idea what a massive spike in climate change looks like.	UCa9RRKIUyyoi1NKl214f_uA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa9RRKIUyyoi1NKl214f_uA	1	Ugi550tyQywGpXgCoAEC	Gold Rush Media
Ugi550tyQywGpXgCoAEC.8Rs6EgV9quy8XBwuBN-V3T		0	2017-09-07 03:59:44	Doc Carter	Kevin Naranek- If you had looked, even briefly, at my supplied articles, you would have seen that the 1st graph is based on a little more than recent history. As in 400,000 years ago til the present day. The debate over whether or not CO2 is the major cause of Global Warming has long since passed. This is is now common knowledge. The only debate left, is whether or not humans are the major contributors to the increase in CO2 levels. The temperature models were based in part, on ice core data, not tree rings, which you would have known had you glanced at the articles. The recent (100 to 200 years) massive spike in Climate Change as compared to the previous 400,000 years of changes including the Ice age is what have scientists concerned, as it correlates with the introduction of the Industrial Age and the greater CO2 emissions. Global Warming and Climate change are based more on Ocean temperature and the data is taken from locations all around the world. I think you have a very rough understanding of how the Scientific Method works. I think you may also be suffering from cognitive dissonance, as you either haven't even looked at the supplied articles or are wilfully misunderstanding them.

This is all based on recent history(since 1950 for example in your linked ref mentioning rainfall events), assumptions that correlation equals causation and since we can't think of anything else that could cause it, it must be CO2, the fact that reliable temperature records don't extend but a short time into the past, and what I believe is the mistake belief that temperature over the past thousands of years has been much more stable than it actually was based on cherry picked tree ring data and misapplication of statistical methods.. Our ability to determine past temperature from proxy records is limited to century scales. So we have no baseline for the assumption that recent temperature change on the same scale isn't a recurrent theme in a climate cycle much longer than 60 to 100 years. Look at the way land based temperature is measured. Do we have a well distributed set of surface based temperature stations to provide the valid sample we need? No we don't and there are far fewer such stations than there were 10 - 20 years ago. Do we make certain those stations we have are placed such that they are kept free from heat sources such as airport runways and other heat sources, away from buildings that radiate heat when the sun goes down, wind blocks such as plants growing up unchecked? No we think we can just apply some statistical method and make it all good. And who has ever done a study to prove the methods work? No one that I've ever seen. You've have your sources which say one thing and I've provided other sources which contradict them. We have reached an impasse.

All they consist of as reported are 30-year averages which add nothing to the understanding of any places typical climate.

Climate was erroneously considered to be constant when coming up with 30 year "Normals" became a practice.

While it is true that a very small number of climate models closely approximate what Satellite and land based instrumental temperature records, the majority of them overestimate temperature. Those few predict the least temperature sensitivity to CO2 increase. The average of all climate models is usually used. That metric shows climate models seriously overestimate temperature.

It backs it up nicely. Not that's it's really the whole point. I didn't say scientists almost completely denied the real danger of massively excessive GW. We have instrumental temperature records and data from plant, animal and geological conditions, to name just a few. What do we have to deny such conclusions? Wikipedia? Really? I'll go with NASA and such scientists as Brian Cox among others over those sites any day. Global Warming is obviously very dangerous for humans as we tend to all live on the coast. Mass migration from said areas due to sea level rising is an obvious huge problem. The ongoing destruction of reefs and the loss of more sensitive wildlife species as well as abnormal weather patterns not explained by El Nino etc are just the first signs.

You actually went to SkepticalScience as a reference after I showed you the C_ap those guys pulled with their 97% study. What almost complete denial are you talking about from scientists who don't think CO2 is such a problem as to be a disaster in the offing. If you are talking about people who are called deniers, from my experience the problem there is the term global warming has become defined in the public mind by the catastrophists as meaning just that a catastrophe(global warming=catastrophe). As far as temperature accelerating past what it has ever been, you do realize all we have to go by on that subject is our instrumental temperature records. Proxy records aren't nearly as accurate and can at best only measure temperature with any accuracy on about the level of a century at a time and there aren't enough sites where conditions exist to draw a conclusion to provide a global picture. Check out this graph https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Ice_Age_Temperature.png Then there is this graph from Georgia State University's Geosciences Department. http://sites.gsu.edu/geog1112/files/2013/03/Vostok_TemperatureCO21.png Temperatures were higher during the last interglacial(and every other one for the past 425,000 years) and sea levels were several meters higher. and look at what temperatures are measured as having been during the other interglacial periods of the past 450,000 years. Take away any CO2 increases caused by humans and Milankovitch cycles, the changes in the amount of the sun's radiation which reaches the earth because of changes in eccentricity, axial tilt, and precession of the Earth's orbit control glacial and interglacial periods. This graph http://www.cabrillo.edu/~rnolthenius/climate/Denialists/D-Ruddiman/milak&temp.jpg shows we are currently in the decline phase of one part of the cycle. Temperatures were 1-2C higher than today 6,000 to 8,000 years ago when CO2 levels were lower. Increases in CO2 haven't caused temperatures to go any higher than they were 6-8 thousand years ago. And as the Milankovitch cycle we are in continues it's decline phase the amount of solar radiation which can be trapped by GHG will also decline. This interglacial has been remarkable both for it's length and stability of climate. You can bet coast lines have followed the same trends advancing and receding as temperature has risen and fallen.

However, the ones which are closest to the instrumental record show the least CO2 sensitivity. Pacific Ocean temperatures have been as much as 2C warmer than today during much of the past 10,000 years(Rosenthal, Linsley, Oppo 2013 for example) and carbon dating of The reliability of climate models doesn't come anywhere close to extending back to 450,000 years. Proxy records for the past 450,000, for what they may be worth, show that current interglacial temperatures are no warmer than any of the other interglacial periods during those 450,000 years and their lengths were much shorter. If the current interglacial followed those of the past 450,000 years in duration, we would already be sliding into the next Ice Age. In fact some scientists believe we already are. You might also find this copy of Cook's study blog of interest http://www.hi-izuru.org/forum/The%20Consensus%20Project/2012-02-27-Official%20TCP%20Guidelines%20%28all%20discussion%20of%20grey%20areas,%20disputed%20papers,%20clarifications%20goes%20here%29.html Be concerned? Yes. Keep researching? Definitely! But not just limited to CO2 effects. The history of science shows that what is believed to be true about the functioning of the physical world changes. “Science advances one funeral at a time.” ― Max Planck I don't know if these links still work and while they are dated, they do demonstrate a willingness to enlarge upon what can be shown scientifically to be the case. -- SCIENTIST STATES HE HOPES CLIMATE SCIENTISTS CAN LIMIT THEIR EXAGERATIONS TO TINY WHITE LIES -- http://stephenschneider.stanford.edu/Mediarology/Mediarology.html On the one hand, as scientists we are ethically bound to the scientific method, in effect promising to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but – which means that we must include all doubts, the caveats, the ifs, ands and buts. On the other hand, we are not just scientists but human beings as well. And like most people we’d like to see the world a better place, which in this context translates into our working to reduce the risk of potentially disastrous climate change. To do that we need to get some broad based support, to capture the public’s imagination. That, of course, means getting loads of media coverage. So we have to offer up scary scenarios, make simplified, dramatic statements, and make little mention of any doubts we might have. This “double ethical bind” we frequently find ourselves in cannot be solved by any formula. Each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest. I hope that means being both. Dr. Stephen Schneider, former IPCC Coordinating Lead Author, =========================== http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119258265537661384 “Some colleagues who share some of my doubts argue that the only way to get our society to change is to frighten people with the possibility of a catastrophe, and that therefore it is all right and even necessary for scientists to exaggerate. They tell me that my belief in open and honest assessment is naive.” ” ‘Wolves deceive their prey, don’t they?’ one said to me recently. Therefore, biologically, he said, we are justified in exaggerating to get society to change.” emeritus professor Daniel Botkin, president of the Center for the Study of the Environment and professor emeritus in the Department of Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology at the University of California, Wall St Journal 17 Oct 2007	UCa9RRKIUyyoi1NKl214f_uA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa9RRKIUyyoi1NKl214f_uA	1	Ugi550tyQywGpXgCoAEC	Gold Rush Media

Ugi550tyQywGpXgCoAEC.8Rs6EgV9quy8WwBNxxmKfq		0	2017-08-31 15:47:55	Doc Carter	Kevin Naranek- Most relevant scientists agree that Global Warming and Climate Change are not only facts, but that it is humankind's activity that is the major cause. Hundreds of computer models show the variations of climate for about the last 450,000 years and repeated tests show roughly the same results; that with the introduction of the Industrial Age, the base temperature has risen significantly. It is agreed that greater amounts ofCO2 reduces the speed at which heat that can leave the Earth. Currently, humans produce/emit more CO2 per year than all of the world's volcanoes combined. The polar ice has been shown to be receding, reducing the reflective ability of the Earth further. The change in ocean temperatures has also had the effect of 'bleaching' (killing) The Great Barrier Reef. And yes, as usual, Science is not perfectly accurate and findings are continually being updated, but the lion's share of evidence points towards human induced Global Warming. The figure of 97% is not entirely accurate, figures of 94% to 97.4% are also. But even it the figure was 75%, that would still be cause for such a speculation to be taken very seriously. If the findings are wrong, a number of people will have some egg on their face. If they are right and we do nothing, then we are dead. Doesn't seem like a hard choice really.

The evidence shows shows that global warming is true, yet a scientist may or may not believe it?" Physics shows that CO2 is a greenhouse gas and adding to it has an atmospheric warming effect. Probably 99.99999% of scientists believe that. The disagreement is on how the rest of the climate system responds to this increase and whether those responses mitigate against or exacerbate the warming and to what degree. Some cynically use the term "Global Warming" as a hammer to beat the idea into people's head that you automatically accept the position that "Global Warming" means the dire consequences by definition. That is what scientists and most "Luke Warmers"(Those who believe there are climate mitigating systems) are saying when they are cast by their opposition as not believing in "Global Warming". (They don't accept evidence of dire consequences is scientifically proved . . . that the jury is still out. Listen again to the first minute or so of the video.

The evidence shows shows that global warming is true, yet a scientist may or may not believe it? Is that what you are saying? Or they believe, according to the evidence, that climate change is real? Next question, how severe of climate change estimated to be, if anyone can make such an estimation? And do we then go back to a 'global cooling? Too, I have read that the entire solar system is warming. I'm wondering how that was determined. If the entire solar system is warming, what is that indicative of? If the change is slow, we'll likely adapt. If not, so-long!	UC_ctcrkGQeuZCWq0wEB6DkQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_ctcrkGQeuZCWq0wEB6DkQ	1	Ugi550tyQywGpXgCoAEC	Gold Rush Media

There is a reason why there are such web sites as http://retractionwatch.com/ Peer review is better than no review but it is hardly fool proof. A lot of climate science is "Pal Reviewed". Some other fields of "science" have an even worse track record with a large number of studies which cannot be duplicated by other researchers. Science eventually self corrects. However, how long it takes varies a great deal. Peer review failed to catch that many flaws and misrepresentations of the studies used in the 97% Cook 2013 paper. 1.) The 97% referred to the number of papers and not the number of scientists. 2.) the alleged consensus is about there being any human contribution to warming(whether it is occurring) rather than it having a dominant roll or about the dangers it may or may not present. 3.) Opinion Survey Papers looking at whether or not "the public" believed in global warming were claimed to provide evidence of global warming. 4.) It was claimed the environmental activists used to rate the papers made independent assessments solely from the abstracts they reviewed when in fact a message board was created and reviewers freely discussed papers and looked up studies on the internet to learn the authors of papers they were reviewing. 5. Reviewers disagreed with what a paper was about over 30% of the time and in over 60% of the cases disagreed with the authors of the papers on the message of the paper. 6. Here is a big NO NO. After 8 weeks of collecting data there were 4 weeks of analysis followed by more data collection. They changed how the data was collected and how much after seeing their results.

The continued premature loss of millions of human lives per year in the third world caused by the indoor air pollution from burning such things as animal dung and crop waste. Third world countries can't afford expensive and unreliable alternative energy sources. The first world isn't going pay to provide it to the third world. It is doubtful the first world is even going to develop enough alternative energy and the backup systems to provide energy 24/7 for their own needs. When you consider the number of coal fired energy plants being developed and planned for the next decade it becomes doubtful that even those countries talking a big game on "climate alarm" are serious about it. I won't even go into the economic chaos created by forcing total alternative energy on the developed world and for something it is looking less and less likely to be a cause for great concern. Proper research will in time develop both far better and cheaper alternative energy technologies. To wait for that better technology seems the better cautious approach.

Many predictions have failed to appear. A sample of such - After 2005 Hurricane Katrina it was claimed that we would be more Cat 5 Hurricanes devastating the United States. The exact opposite happened. The same goes for tornadoes. The number of strong F3+ tornadoes has declined since 1950. Satellite and other improvements in instrumentation account for increases in the counts of both storms. Though there has been an ever so slight increase in the amount of sea level rise. The amount of sea level rise has been reduced from 3.28mm/year to 3.0mm/year. Global Weather related disaster losses as a proportion of GDP have declined since 1990. The idea that climate scientists can predict the future should be treated with a bit of skepticism since we don't fully understand the workings of the climate system even if CO2 levels were static(which they aren't even without human effects) much less how clouds, rain, and etc. react to CO2 level increases. Different model runs of rain fall effects show increased rain and others show less rain. And climate models over predict climate temperature sensitivity. Climate Science is imperfect like humans and all human endeavors. This is not to say that humans dont contribute to part of any increase in surface temperature. But how much and the effects for good or ill is ?!?!	UCa9RRKIUyyoi1NKl214f_uA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa9RRKIUyyoi1NKl214f_uA	1	Ugi550tyQywGpXgCoAEC	Gold Rush Media

John Stossel audience are logical thinking people and all they need is good science but they the (Scientist refused to debate) only shows they are afraid to be challenged. Bill Mahr and MSNBC or ABC, etc will not challenge. Good Job John Stossel, keep up the good work.<br /><br />What is sad John would have been fair and gave equal if not more air time to Global Warming. To Bad the other Scientists are afraid to speak their minds.	UC_opLjgRWlFXxSHJyjTYzfA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_opLjgRWlFXxSHJyjTYzfA	0

UgidZErAi0Lm4HgCoAEC.8R_hZy3DwO98VeYqaQ34UL		4	2017-07-30 22:55:13	Gerald Ford	Jay Campbell: fair points. I can give you one example, 1:45 "the climate models have been totally wrong" this is just silly on its face. For one thing, models by definition make predictions with varying degrees of precision relating to phenomena which CANNOT BE PREDICTED. If they could be predicted, they wouldn't need models. Therefore, all models will be 'wrong' when used to predict stochastic processes, it's a question of how wrong and therefore how useful are they. If I made a program to model lineups at a McDonald's, it's near certain I'd get the number of customers at 1:42PM incorrect, but I'm also 95% certain I'd know the total customers in a month. Similarly, climate models have been as correct as we can expect to be with a highly chaotic process like climate. They've overestimated certain things, such as the extent to which the atmosphere would warm vs. the oceans in the 1998-2015 period (more heat went to the oceans), and underpredicted others, such as how quickly the Arctic summer sea ice would melt (it's melting faster than we thought). For another example, the fact that Stossel gave even a second of airtime to 'climategate' is utterly laughable. Multiple independent reviews have all completely exonerated the supposed actors in the climategate story, there was simply no wrong-doing there, it just made excellent fodder for the small government ideologues like Stossel. For a final example, Stossel claims that government subsidization of green energy "only hurts the poor", demonstrating he doesn't know the first thing about the topics involved. Notwithstanding the fact that a government could, conceivably, have taken the funds for the subsidy from an increase in taxes on the wealthy, generating more energy from clean sources HELPS the poor who are disproportionately unlikely to have health insurance by cleaning the air (relatively) and reducing their exposure to pollutants and carcinogens. These are what economists call externalities. But hey, there's no reason for Stossel to give it any more complex treatment than a 9th grader, his devotion to the religion of small government wouldn't allow nuance or facts to enter in when they don't help his case.

In fact the Greenland icesheet experienced above normal precipitation- it is usually quite dry there. Have you seen the date going back 10 years?" Temps got colder after march. All of May, June and July were below the 1998-2010 median. Half of May was well below average, pretty much all of June was too, and all of July was. Much of June and July saw record cold. I Haven't seen the final data for August yet but understand it's following the same downward trend. effectively May, June, and July, peak melt season was below freezing and the melt didn't happen. Since 2012 which was the peak melt, the annual melt has declined, and since 2015 it's clearly turned. The Greenland ice sheet is calving so much this year because of the massive increase in precipitation/ice volume, but even with that calving considered in ice mass loss, the net ice mass gain for this year is about 150-200 Gt. The sea ice sheets are also increasing in volume. There is no getting away from it but the data has been showing for the last two years the Arctic ice mass is increasing, and this year it's set to reach levels we've not seen for a very, very long time. The data going back ten years only further supports the argument that this is cyclical and related to solar cycles, not CO2. The data shows that since 2010 things are completely changing which is what you'd expect, and what was predicted by the scientific community which does not agree with ACO2 GW/CC.

You're saying the dock at Miami are slipping into the ocean? Where are you getting that?" The world does exist beyond Miami. The sea levels are rising, as i stated, but that is not new, it's a fairly constant rate, and it's not speeding up. Depending on where, the sea level rise will also be affected by other aspects. Many places it appears that sea levels are rising quickly because of reclaimed land sinking. Some suffer from tectonic slip, others coastal erosion. It's not as simple as every where sea levels are encroaching onto land it's no other factor than the oceans warming, expanding , and rising. In Scandinavia sea levels are falling because the land is slowly expanding back up after the weight of the ice sheets from the last major ice age has been removed. Kiribati is an atoll, some islands are from uplift some from accretion, there's numerous factors as to why the islands are sinking below the ocean surface. It's not ALL because of sea level rise and the rate at which sea levels rise in different locations cannot be put simply on 'they're rising faster' .... it's not that black and white. Miami included.

Satellites measure the micro gravitational pull that so much water has" I am familiar with how it's done. Accurately is debatable. There are influences and the margin of error is still greater than the amount by which the sea level is rising. The rate at which the sea level is rising is unchanged. "Or in the case of Miami- you can look at the docks" Irrelevent "You're talking like these are not measurable" Absolutely not. The primary issue is whether they are measurable to such a degree of accuracy there is no ambiguity, and that is not the case. the secondary issue is do the measurements show any increase in the rate of rise or exponential rise, and the answer is no. I've never said they are not measurable and i'm not talking as if that's the case. "CO2, average atmospheric temperature all can be measured and quantified" anything can be measured and quantified. "Just a few degrees difference can alter ocean currents such as the Gulf stream with catastrophic effects" That old chestnut. If that should happen, then there are natural influences which are far more likely to actually alter ocean currents, and jet streams, than the slow gradual warming of the oceans, which, incidentally, have stopped warming. The idea that anthropological ocean warming will cause the PDO or AMO to 'switch off' is just nonsense. If that is the primary argument for cutting anthropological CO2 then people worried about that will likely get a serious shock one day in the not too distant future even if they do, miraculously, cut anthropological CO2. "No, what's insane is taken what is clearly stated to be an average and call them local projections" Please, don't do yourself the disservice of quote mining or making false statements about what i have or have not written. If you do not understand the point being made then ask me to clarify it so you can understand it, but I have not called them 'local projections' and that is NOT what i was suggesting, you know full well that i didn't refer to them as local projections and probably know that's not what i meant.

Or in the case of Miami- you can look at the docks. You're talking like these are not measurable. CO2, average atmospheric temperature all can be measured and quantified. Pass sea levels can easily be measured by sediment deposits and even historical records, "Ask an 'alarmist' as you call them to look at the key of these chartss, you'll generally see the difference between the green/yellow normal at the tropics and the boiling hot hell fire red at the equator is normally about 10 degrees. Hardly a major difference,' Just a few degrees difference can alter ocean currents such as the Gulf stream with catastrophic effects "The folly of this is how easily sea temps and surface temps can change by huge margins in as little as one mile, and yet they project this as a 'temperature' over thousands and thousands of miles. It's insane." No, what's insane is taken what is clearly stated to be an average and call them local projections.

Prior to that, things like elevation, specific location, types of thermometer, etc. were not constant when reporting the temperature. In recent years the numbers usually come from airports, but that is also a poor measurement, because they elevation tends to vary a lot. One degree is well within the margin of error, and how that one degree is determined is important. Every decade is different, the 1950s were quite cool compared to the 1990s, so of course that means they deliberately chose a point in the past that would make it look like it has warmed, but not to little, and not too much. Anyone dealing with government statistics knows observations can typically be twisted to show whatever is convenient. The other day Bill Nye actually claimed the weather should be like that of 1750 without man-made influence, which is absurd, since that was still the Little Ice Age, and fossil fuels weren't significantly used until after 1880.

Just so you don't think i'm avoiding the question i'm responding and will respond in more detail later in the week when i have time if needed. For now though, take a look at 2016, yu can do an internet search for 'Record cold temperature' i advise not to use Google ( that's a whole nother conversation, they do suppress results, you'll get better results through Startpage or another non Google run search engine ) See how many places you can find around the world, both northern and southern hemisphere, summer and winter, that suffered prolonged periods of cold and how many cold weather temperature records were broken by huge margins. Often you'll see they were 200 year old records. 200 years is significant because that's where we are in terms of solar cycles and climate cycles. Search how many places had 'out of season' snowfall, frost, hail. Unseasonably cold snaps. There are multiple sources for such things. I have friends and contact all over the world so i often hear about these things through them, then use the internet to find reports in local newspapers, and double check them by finding the national meteorological website for the relevant country. You will almost never hear of these things via the mainstream. They will always report a 'record high' but never report on a record low. So you just have to put the work in and find them yourself. If you want just pick a number or countries, call up their Met-Office website and go through the archives. Do that and build yourself a little chart. Once you've done that take a look at sunspots ( once again NASA have altered how they count sunspots to artificially increase the number ) but you can get sunspot data from multiple sources. Once you've got your sunspot data, you'll also want x-flare and M-flare CME data. Any solar observatory website will provide this, yu can use NASA if you want, or any other national or independent observatory. with al of this you can build your own chart and see how the drop off in sunspots correlates with record cold temps, snowfalls etc, and the earthbound X-flares or m-flares matches tropospheric compression, sudden surface charging, heatwaves or tropical storms. Pull all the data, put it together, and it's fairly self evident. Of course some will jump in and say correlation is not causation, which is kind of funny as how they love to argue correlation is not causation for what they term 'natural variant' but never seem to use that same argument for atmospheric CO2 levels and climate changes. Apparently there, correlation is absolute proof. The record lows are outstripping the highs by a long way, that's undeniable. The highs?, well they are rather problematic anyway. NASA and IPCC have yet again been exposed for fudging them. You can get some data from NASA but it's not always reliable, NASA have been known to delete or alter data which was published and became problematic, disappeared, then reappeared a few days later having been altered. More than once that has happened, occasionally it's captured and archived before they change it. They also recently altered how they measure TSI to hide the drop as TSI has been exponentially falling. Remember NASA are fundamentally a military operation, people forget that, and they are not beyond propoganda. NOAA and the UK Met office also supply data. DMI is another. But i'll go through all my docs if you insist. I recommend David Du Byrne's channel Adapt2030 he has some very well researched information on the subject.

Or is you supposition that Florida is sinking rather than the oceans rising" I cannot answer what P Mason's supposition is, but the climate industry is one of the most profitably and fastest growing there is. Throwing $400M away on a project such as this would not be the first time, nor likely the last, such vast sums have been spent in such a way. There are tremendous profits in opiates, pipelines, reconstruction of war zones, providing the military with equipment and services. Paving roads, building highways. All kinds of things. Are we to believe that money would not be spent on combating sea level rise for any other reason than a moral one? And yes, much of it can be equated to coastal erosion or land slip as well as sea level rise.

UggQhbl2SoBXg3gCoAEC.8QimbpeYGpX8WESbJK7Tuw		1	2017-08-14 06:52:36	caribstu	Sea level rise is as nuanced as atmospheric temperature. Ask those who subscribes to anthropological CO2 climate change theory how sea level is measured and the vasy majority, if not 99% cannot tell you. Ask them where ( which is very important) most sea level data is collected from same result, most can't tell you. Ask them how satellite data is used to measure sea levels they can't tell you. Same can be said for how atmospheric 'global temperatures' are created. They don't know. Yet they are convinced by a politician or actor who appears on CNN telling them man made 'carbon emissions' are causing climate change and sea level rise, they believe it. Note how the likes of Al Gore always say 'carbon' or 'carbon emissions' .... never 'carbon dioxide'. Certainly never CO2-13 or CO2-14. Wouldn't want the average Joe to connect the two dots, so just say 'carbon' as it sounds so much more nasty and dangerous. If one looks into satellite measurements of sea levels it's quite easy to see how virtually impossible it is to create any sort of legitimate median. Let alone argue that sea level rise is different now to how it was 200 years ago, 1000 years ago or 5000 years ago. Honestly, it's as flawed as counting moving chickens in an industrial chicken farm and creating an average chicken height. If one looks at the land based location of data collection it's quite easy to see how flawed that is. Just how many locations suffer from coastal erosion which affects sea level measurement. How many locations are actually reclaimed land which is now heavily built on and effectively slipping back into the sea. Observing where sea level data is collected, and comparing it to where it's not collected and one can see the exact same pattern as that for atmospheric temperatures. In terms of open ocean data collection this is severely flawed also. In particular when the data is dependent on satellite. Ask an 'alarmist' which part of the atmosphere most climate satellites orbit in, and what happens to the orbit of a satellite when the earth is hit by cosmic weather. Ask them what a tropospheric compression is and how that affects satellites, and in particular satellites measuring ocean depths and sea levels. Then there are other issues such as the Pacific which is generally warmer, and higher than the Atlantic for example. Or Scandinavia where, as land lifts, all be it slowly, after having shed the weight of ice which compressed it down during the last ice age, sea levels 'appear' to be falling. Getting an 'average' sea level is not only as problematic as getting an 'average' temperature but it's also as ridiculously misleading. Possibly why if you look at the colour charts they create for sea temperatures there will almost inevitably be a deep red band across the center of the globe, gradually turning orangey red around the tropics, to yellow, green, deep blue, pale blue, then finally white near the poles. The insinuation of course being the water at the pole is almost ice cold, green is 'normal' yellow 'nice' and at the equator it's hell fire boiling hot red. Ask an 'alarmist' as you call them to look at the key of these chartss, you'll generally see the difference between the green/yellow normal at the tropics and the boiling hot hell fire red at the equator is normally about 10 degrees. Hardly a major difference, and we are talking over thousands of miles by the way, with totally different magnetospheric protection, Ozone, solar surface charging etc. I've done dives where there was 10 degrees difference between the surface and 30m depth, and five degrees difference at the surface between entry point and exit point. But these graphs are designed to completely mislead people into thinking the ocean 'mean' temps are accurate and at the equator they are catastrophically warm. 29 degrees C surface temperature at the equator btw is not unusually warm. The folly of this is how easily sea temps and surface temps can change by huge margins in as little as one mile, and yet they project this as a 'temperature' over thousands and thousands of miles. It's insane. The same can be said for sea levels. Basically, the margin of error is so unbelievably wide, it surpasses any increase in rise to the point they simply cannot say there is any rise at all, let alone an increased rate of rise. I don't think many people would deny sea levels are rising, but they have been rising at the same rate for about 10,000 years and it simply hasn't altered. The rise is due to the slow gradual warming of the oceans since the end of the last ice age, when trillions of tonnes of melt water poured into them initially raising them dramatically but with extremely cold water. Slowly, gradually, over thousands of years the water has warmed and expanded. At a fairly constant rate. If the science surrounding solar cycle driven climate cycles is correct, which it certainly appears to be, then in the not to distant future much of that water will once again be locked up into land ice and sea levels will drop considerably once again. In addition to sea temperatures decreasing. When it comes down to trying to discuss this with an anthropological CO2 theorist they're convinced the data is fool proof. Flawless. That's usually when it's worth pointing out that Kiribati, the sea level rise poster boy, is an island chain of atolls, some formed by uplift and some accretion. Just as they came up, they can come down. The Pacific rim is the most active tectonic rims and the plates are shifting frequently, there is absolutely no way to tell how much of Kiribati's predicament is tectonic. Tomorrow Kiribati could just as easily be 400 feet above the ocean as it could be 400 ft below it on one second of tectonic activity. Pointing to Kiribati and claiming what is happening there is 100% proof of man made climate change and sea level rise is not only the most intellectually dishonest argument there is, it's also profoundly unscientific, and that basically sums up the entire Anthropological climate change position. intellectually dishonest and profoundly unscientific	UC6QXbM1o_jgGnuVDm4lZ6mw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6QXbM1o_jgGnuVDm4lZ6mw	1	UggQhbl2SoBXg3gCoAEC	Wake Up America

The Greenland ice sheet alone is on course to make a net ice mass gain of 200 Gt this year. Obviously we don't know what the loss will be from calving but whilst calving is increasing due to the increased snowfall, the melt hasn't happened. This more than negates the calving loss. In fact we've seen record cold through may, june, july which saw no melt at all. The prediction as of today is a net ice mass increase of 150-200 Gt. Not including sea ice. It's incredible that the media and politicians are able to keep spinning this 'warming' 'hottest year ever' when the data show completely the opposite. Or the myth that the ice caps are melting away and the public buy into it. Just look at Lemming Herder's comment above ( if you can be bothered to sift through the shyte ) and it's easy to see how and why they (media and politicians) get away with it.

We cant decrease CO2 emissions in time to save ourselves." and you respond to that with "No, but we can stop emissions and allow for a higher chance of human survival." Continuing to push the notion that climate change is man made, or that CO2 is the primary factor and we can somehow alter that. Doing so 'increases our survival" Where as, in response to your earlier comment I post a laymen's explanation as to why each of your 'staggering proof' bullet points are misleading, factually inaccurate, and not actually 'proof', but you completely ignore my comment. Don't respond to it at all. Not even to one of the several points raised. Quite telling that isn't it. I suggest it's safe to conclude that, rather than enter into an intelligent debate based on scientific data, facts, real world observations, cause and effect, etcetera, you opt to avoid that, instead opting for buzzwords and the vacuous CO2 narrative. FYI, " a higher chance of human survival " The rate at which TSI is dropping, assuming you don't want to starve to death, we have more chance of survival with high or higher CO2 levels. You should be thankful atmospheric CO2 is where it is.	UC6QXbM1o_jgGnuVDm4lZ6mw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6QXbM1o_jgGnuVDm4lZ6mw	1	UggQhbl2SoBXg3gCoAEC	Wake Up America

This is like taking a thimble full of water from a pond in India and using it to determine the health of the oceans on the planet. Not scientifically accurate. Also if you look at ice core samples( I really don't think these are accurate but let's use it for argument sake) from the past there have been periods that have been much warmer while CO2 has been far less concentrated and much cooler with far more CO2 concentration. All before humans emitted any emissions. Which would be proof of what? CO2 does not drive climate. It contributes sure but it is not the driver. This is like thinking the boxcar is driving the train when you can see the locomotive(the sun) only 3 cars away. The sun drives the climate of our whole solar system. Every planet in our solar system is currently warming. Are we causing the warming on the other planets as well?

What's happening with out climate is not primarily driven by man made CO2 emissions. That's just fictional and I'm sorry to say but the 'evidence' for man made climate change caused by CO2 emissions is not staggering at all. The theory is staggering, but the evidence is not. CO2 levels over 400 ppm is not necessarily a bad thing, and they are certainly not the highest they've been. Life always does better with higher atmospheric CO2 levels That we are also seeing sea level rises is not in its self evidence of anthropological climate change. See levels are rising at the same rate they have done for 12,000 years. The Ice caps are not melting, that is a total falsehood. On the contray there is an increase in global ice volume and both the polar ice caps are increasing. Antarctica has been on the increase for about four or five years now, as was to be expected, where as the Arctic has only recently, in the last two years begun to increase. By 2016 it was back to 'normal' levels (what ever 'normal' means) and now it's increasing beyond the 1998-2010 median. In fact, part of May, most of June, and all of July saw record cold temperatures in Greenland and the arctic, which are the peak melt months. with a massive increase in snowfall during the preceeding season and with a virtually non existent melt this year it is safe to conclude that Arctic ice volume, and in particular the Greenland ice shelf will be considerably increased. Exactly why we are seeing so much calving this year and even with the net ice loss from calving the total gain this year will probably be in the region of 200 Gt. So no, Ice caps are not melting in the way people think. Ocean temperatures, once again, like many other things since the last ice age have been warming at a continuous rate for around 8000 years but are now on the decline. Since the turn of the El Nino in 2016 the Pacific has already dropped by almost a degree. Marine life making mass migrations has nothing to do with warming. The rate at which oceans have warmed has been constant, and as i said they have already begun to cool. Regardless, marine animals are used to sudden excessive changes of temperature by as much as ten degrees, a slow gradual warming or cooling does not cause mass migrations. The changing of our magnetosphere and pole shift very well may do, but anthropological CO2 has absolutely nothing to do with marine mass migrations. Coral reefs dying again has nuances. coral reefs can face a sudden rise of three, four even ten degrees for a prolonged period and get bleached out. Then a few months later regrowth and be back to where they were before, strong and more resilient. they've been doing it for several million years. Coral reefs dying, and i suppose you're mostly referring to the GBR and south Pacific has far more to do with sediment and run off, as well as over fishing of the main predatory fish. Stronger and more frequent natural weather disasters, well that one is entirely false, there are fewer of those. The climate and weather patterns are changing and shifting without doubt but it's not due to CO2 and it's certainly not evidence of CO2 driven climate. There are not stronger or more frequent natural weather disasters. what there are, are more snows, frosts, and out of season record colds. Rising global surface temperatures, again entirely false. That's something which is easily disproved. Of course there are sporadic moments of what's called 'surface charging' which are on the increase due to the decline in our magnetosphere but they are anomalies and not to be confused with a 'trend' in surface temperatures. TSI has dropped dramatically over the last three years and is continuing its decline exponentially. As it does, atmospheric, ocean, and surface will see rapid drops in temperature. I'm sorry to disappoint you but while there is some evidence and some agreement that anthropological CO2 has a small contribution to climate change it is a very small, almost insignificant one. Nothing you've stated has any real relation to CO2 and is certainly not evidence that climate change is man made. On the contrary, pretty much everything claimed to be evidence of that falls down under genuine scientific scrutiny, and there are far more established and scientifically proven explanations as to why those events occur and what is causing our climate to shift in the way it is.

Marcia Barlow, The earth does go through natural cycles but you have to look at the rate of CO2 climbing in the atmosphere increase since the industrial revolution. Also caribstu, the evidence for man made climate change caused by CO2 emissions is staggering. CO2 levels are over 400 ppm right now and have never been over 300 ppm in the past 800,000 years. We are also seeing sea level rises, ice caps melting, ocean temperatures warming, marine life making mass migrations, coral reefs dying, ocean dead zones increasing in size and numbers, stronger and more frequent natural weather disasters, and rising global surface temperatures.

But the evidence does not point to a panic mode of jump into the conclusion that auto emissions are the culpret, that cattle must be killed, that people must be killed, and that a one world government is the only salvation for our survival. There is evidence going in many directions. Do you really believe that oil executive, that wall street mogul, those mega bankers would be willing to sacrifice their loved ones for the sake of claim of rightness? That's why science, in how it is set up always has a disclaimer: "This is how things look right now, but stay tuned. We're still watching and working." Science does not claim to be a god or a God. It simply gives us its best shot. That's why right now we're getting reports of, "It looks like the globe is warming, oops. Wait a minute. We have more evidence to examine." But along comes the politician with, "Never let a good crisis go to waste," and "How can we use this to extract more money and power." That's called 'politicizing science.'

Look at the data and determine if that scientific claim is valid based on the evidence presented. In the case of global warming it is completely valid and has substantial evidence. Just because someone made a prediction that was wrong doesn't mean you can jump to conclusions on other matters.

The science of global warming was identified 100s of years ago, was pushed into the public's consciousness decades ago but is only being gradually accepted now. The cause and effects are clear. The consequences were identified and have been seen to occur, stronger winds, changed weather systems with increased dry in some areas wet in others and polar blasts bringing unseasonal cold to some areas. The problem that you scandalmongers miss is the inertia in the system and the feedback elements. Loss of ice cover in the poles means greater solar absorption thus aggravating ice loss. Who cares if the local daytime temperatures rise by a few degrees, that does not matter, what matters is the global average temperature. Personally, I think we have already gone too far. The ozone depletion was a good example of how industry could make changes for the better but that only meant a change of product. Global warming means a change of industry, and big money and tobacco lobby tactics have kept the American people dumb and they used to set the table. America is about to become irrelevant as the rest of the world moves to fix the problem.

Ice is also the most reflective surface on the planet while water is the most absorbent in respect to sunlight gathered, which further heats the region when it disappears, and that leads to more permafrost thawing which holds gigatons of methane gas which has caused the deadliest extinction in earths history which killed approximately 90% of life on the planet, we have data on shit like this, and even if we are not the prime culprit in climate change we need to do all we can to stop it.

Trying to scare people that certain consequences will follow if global warming is caused by human carbon emissions, does not prove the hypothesis that global warming is caused by human carbon emissions.

For 90,000 years, civilization was impossible after the last interglacial of the current Ice Age. When our current interglacial started, nearly 12,000 years ago, temperatures shot up +7C in 30 years -- far faster than the UN's "horror story." That made civilization possible for the first time in 90 millennia. Life prefers warmth. Polar bears will adapt; they've already started to adapt. During the far warmer Eemian, polar bears had zero sea ice for centuries and survived just fine.

First off, if the polar bears go extinct then they'll be one of the thousands of species that go extinct every year. And the Earth goes through cycles of heating and ice ages. We've been heating since the last ice age, because obviously that's how you come out of an ice age so water levels have been going up since way before human co2 contributions. So the polar bears were going to go eventually no matter what. And as far as the greatest extinction in history, it was the end Permian that wiped out 96% of all life. And even nasa says it was due to volcanism and/or a meteor. You're clearly someone who just believes what bill nye tells them. And as far as the "97% of scientists" thing, look up John Cook, and how he came to that number and then look in the mirror and call yourself a fool for believing.

UghLZHOnLp-XuHgCoAEC	14	3	2017-01-15 07:25:29	Nathan Dennis	I wonder if Stossel is paid to act stupid or if he actually is stupid. There is a growing consensus among climate scientists that it&#39;s too late to address the problem of a warming planet. The speed at which the earths natural systems are changing is the main contributor to unpredictability. Fires, floods, droughts, record cold below the Arctic circle and record heat within the Arctic circle at the same time, slow moving and wildly meandering jet streams, anoxic events in the ocean that kill millions of marine animals, dying coral reefs and the daily extinction of species have been proven to be a direct result of a warming planet caused by carbon emissions, which are also acidifying the oceans and killing the plankton that provide most of the earths oxygen. Those are the facts as presented by climate scientists, some of whom still present their findings as a call to action but that number is getting smaller. The growing number of those scientists that dissent from the consensus are expressing the opinion that the consensus is far too conservative. A smaller yet growing group of scientists see this as an extinction event. Currently the earths temperature is rising faster than species can adapt and survive. Obviously without them there is no us.

There is not one single study that attempts to classify how much of the warming since 1950 is natural and how much is natural and until they do no amount of talking about warming effects proves a thing. Alarmist scientists say that the warming from 1860 to 1950 was natural and the warming from 1950 to 2000 was man made. Did the natural warming just stop in 1950? How do they know? They don't and that is terminally devastating to their argument and always will be, it can't be proven, show ONE study that does. You can't.

Just because this political game is being played doesn't change that. This politics and lies and info manipulation is everybody scratching to make the most money out of this. We are doomed, we will destroy the planet and we cannot stop it at this point. When, what and how it will happen is a combination of all these factors. Plankton dead oceans to world starvation. Or rising oceans and what ever that effect will be. The list goes on. All the separate damages will all develop at the same time. What does us in could be any one or combination of damage. We don't really care. We can deal with the problems as they arise. It's not affecting us now really. I need a good life and to take care of myself. I need a home, good job and good life. So reactivity, we can deal with the separate effect individually when we really need to which isn't today for my current life plan. It will start falling apart where we cannot make decisions and keep up and we will lose. Well It was a good run. All things end one way or another eventually so just accept it.

For one, science is never done by consensus. Second, the so-called "consensus" was made up and fraudulently so. Taking thousands of scientists, and tossing out most of them to achieve a 97% consensus figure is not how science is done. And in Cook's study, some of the scientists he said agreed with the climate change scam disagreed with his assessment of their paper. Oops! Statistically, there is no significant increase in any of the "scary" things you talked about. You're looking at left-wing anecdotal evidence presented in the biased Big News media. Some of the Warming Alarmists condemn Big Oil for supporting so-called deniers (who don't deny much of anything), but don't realize that they're getting their news and science from the corporations owned by the same people who own Big Oil. Oops! We live in an Ice Age, and warming alarmists seem to be in denial of this. Global Warming is good, because life thrives on warmth. The rate of warming is small compared to other periods of massive warming -- like +7C in 30 years at the start of the Holocene. That made civilization possible. When you wake up and realize that melting ice is not that big of a problem, and learn that global cooling in an Ice Age is the real danger, you might start making some sense.

You are mired within a set of expectations that keep you insulated from dealing with hard and disturbing truths. Every professional denier that has put forth an argument against the science of climate change has been thoroughly debunked several times by people with no vested interest in the outcome. I personally, am not invested in the outcome. Your investment, like most people on both sides of this illegitimate debate seems purely emotional. You are free to believe what the deniers say, and I am free to accept the science that is presented. Your freedom is illusory, mine is real. But you aren't alone.

You cannot construct meaningful global trends to tenths of a degree with fudged temp data of the NOAA et al kind. Historical trends include data from buckets of water and warmed engine inlet sources ??? "Historical, so what?" you might ask. Well, not so historical now. The modern hi tech argo system has recently been calibrated to this old ship data - -SAY WHAT?? Well ,it got rid of the pause - marvelous!! The land surface record is even worse virtually no data from 14 million sq kms of the coldest region on the planet, antarctica, exists meaning the major part of the "global temp" fabrication is a construct of inately warm urban measurements. It is nothing but quackery Ask yourself how you would come up with a meaningful system to track global temps from scratch. Front and centre would be - data sites must be positioned geographically to represent the entire planet and "bias warming" such as urban settlement records must be excluded. Neither of these things are happening. If it wasn't for the trend of glacier melt we would struggle to know it is warming. Despite this not fit for purpose infrastructure the claimed temp rise is only 0.8c - simply not a problem.

UggUdI2GxEM1i3gCoAEC	24	15	2017-01-03 00:08:45	Micah Schweitzer	1. Before the Industrial Revolution, CO2 was at a natural 100,000 year high called an interglacial. Then, after a century of putting underground carbon into the air, CO2 jumped up from about 300 ppm to about 400 ppm, where it hasn&#39;t been for millions of years. That&#39;s evidence that we&#39;ve caused the increase in CO2, and given CO2&#39;s known role as a greenhouse gas, that&#39;s evidence that we&#39;ve caused global climate change.<br /><br />2. So, what&#39;s the danger? When the whole Earth undergoes a rapid change, when something that normally takes millions of years happens in just a few centuries, living things can&#39;t keep up and mass extinctions occur. But, even assuming the runaway greenhouse effect we&#39;ll get once the Arctic methane pockets burst is so bad that you won&#39;t be able to grow crops outside, our species will still survive. We&#39;ll become more and more dependent on insulated environments and the technological infrastructure to maintain them, until the point where we might as well be in a spaceship; but we&#39;ll survive, at least in the developed world. So, if you can accept the future where we lose most living species on Earth, where we risk losing free air and water and all the people who depend on those being free, and where we&#39;ll all have to pay more to more specialists to keep the same comfortable life we have now, throwing the Red Queen Hypothesis right out the Broken Window, then rapid global climate change is A-OK.<br /><br />3. We know that government funding can&#39;t fix this. Informed consumer demand and anti-crony laws can. Yes, I&#39;m a libertarian. Do what you want if it steps on no toes. In that spirit, I should remind you that a tax cut is not a subsidy. Using public domain laws to seize private land for the benefit of an international pipeline company is much more like a subsidy. Fining solar users in Nevada to protect Warren Buffet&#39;s monopoly on the state&#39;s grid is like a subsidy. And depending on whom you ask, the US&#39; involvement in certain oil-rich countries, from installing the Shah in Iran in 1953 all the way to present day, can be seen as an impossibly huge subsidy.

But if you're wrong on some huge life issues, wouldn't you want someone to consider helping you before the great culling? Compassion for others isn't a bad thing, especially if you actually help. The unrepentant will eventually get burned. Yes, that's the natural order of things. Do you think developing your own patience is a good thing?

The oceans contain 37,400 billion tons (GT) of suspended carbon. Land biomass has 2000-3000 GT. The atmosphere contains 720 billion tons of CO2 and humans contribute only 6 GT additional load on this balance. The oceans, land and atmosphere exchange CO2 continuously, so the additional load by humans is incredibly small. A small shift in the balance between oceans and air would cause a CO2 increase much more severe than anything we could produce.

I have to agree that capitalism is not "natural," but we are inescapably "above" nature. With that superiority comes a heavy responsibility. I suspect that what you have a beef with are not capitalists, _per se,_ but publicly traded corporations which are selfishness squared. Capitalism by itself is not evil, just as power is not intrinsically evil. Lord Acton said "Power *_tends_* to corrupt." It doesn't guarantee corruption. Corruption comes from selfishness and all publicly traded corporations have selfishness written into their DNA -- their Articles of Incorporation. Their first priority is to the shareholder. Sad. Customers come in a distant 4th place, if that. The Medical Industry is a prime example of this evil -- pushing poisonous "medicines" to keep the customer limping along. It's called "Disease Maintenance," not "Health Maintenance." When two people get together to pool their funds in order to create something they cannot achieve separately, that's capitalism. It's a good thing when the two people don't go all psychopathic on their way to prosperity. They can be generous, productive and loving. Capitalism doesn't prevent that. The real evil is self-concern (ego) -- the heart of selfishness. When we improve our definitions of terms and look more clearly at what is really bad or good, then we can start to make improvements.

UggUdI2GxEM1i3gCoAEC.8NFX7EOlANd8VDz-nXemsp		9	2017-07-20 05:53:48	Rod Martin, Jr.	+ Micah Schweitzer, thanks for the cordial reply, but you're wrong. (And _italics_ is created by underscore on either side, while *bold* is created with asterisk on either side. *_Using both allows bold italic._* And a tiny bit of SHOUTING for emphasis is okay by me.) But "rapid" is a fuzzy, non-scientific term. Science likes numbers. Our modern warming has been about +0.7C per century. The same rate of "scary" warming from 1970 to 2000 happened between 1910 and 1940, and no one complained. In 1817, recovering from the year without a summer, we had about +50C per century. Yikes! And people and life loved the return of the warmth. At the start of the Holocene, warming spiked at +7C in about 30 years (Al Gore said 10 years). That warming made civilization possible for the first time in 90,000 years. All change will create problems. The really sticky part of this is human attachment to things like ice. We need to let go of these emotional ties and look at the larger picture. Climate is going to change whether we like it or not, and cooling in our current *_ongoing Ice Age_* is not only insane, but criminal. 150 ppm -- CO2 mass extinction -- all C3 species start to die. That's 85% of ALL plant species, and nearly *_99% of all FOOD crop species._* 400 ppm -- Today's level. 800 ppm -- The level at which numerous plant species across the planet freaked out and evolved C4 species in order to cope with the CO2 *_starvation!_* 1,600 ppm -- CO2 Normal -- the average for the last 600 million years. Before that time, CO2 levels were something like as high as 210,000 ppm (taking the place of O2 in the atmosphere, because there was no oxygen before photosynthesis). 8,000 ppm -- Rich CO2 level where life thrived so much, it laid down our fossil fuels. 10,000 ppm -- Nominal levels on naval submarines. 20,000 ppm -- Maximum CO2 level on NASA spacecraft. Humans are just fine going from 400 ppm to 10,000 ppm in seconds. Plants, too, for the most part. Some species don't react the same way, but no one level is perfect for all species. The best compromise is to go for the average level which most species like. Temperature? Change itself of 20C per day is not uncommon, so animals and plants, for the most part are already used to big changes in temperature. So, acclimation is not the problem. Species can move. Individual trees can't, but their species can. How else did islands ever get trees?

The claim that CO2 is a greenhouse gas comes from ONE single clearly flawed experiment. Carried out before the turn of the last century by a Victorian scientist! Recent science clearly shows that CO2 in the atmosphere FOLLOWS the temperature. NOT the other way round. In the past, CO2 was at levels a hundred times higher than today and all without any human industry. You know what happened then? There was MORE life than today. And it was huge life because the oxygen was much higher then too. A brontosaurus would suffocate in today's atmosphere. More CO2, more plants, more oxygen. Duh! Trees were 300 feet tall and animals nearly the size of passenger jets walked, and flew, the Earth. As for sea level change. I went to the same beach I was taken to as a toddler 57 years ago. Guess what I found? The sea level is EXACTLY THE SAME as it was in 1960! Should I distrust my lying eyes OR a bunch of crooks who were CAUGHT RED HANDED CONSPIRING to screw the people out of MORE research money? Al Gore said both coasts would be under 100 feet of water by now. Al Gore is a crooked scheming lying piece of shi.... but I digress. Why do the alarmists need more money?

I believe that was called the Pleiocine Epoch. I'll have to go check again to be sure of that. The issue isn't whether life can exist under current conditions. The issue is RAPID (italics would be nice here; I'm not yelling) global change, changes over a few centuries instead of a few million years. Where mass extinctions are concerned, changes in seasonal temperatures and ensuing changes in geography that fast might as well be cataclysmic.

So, doubling extinction levels only means strong starvation levels. We're slowly approaching moderate starvation levels of 1,000 ppm. If you love life, you'll promote far more CO2. And all this warming that CO2 is supposed to make happen (but isn't) is good for the planet, because we live in an Ice Age! Cold kills. And the vast majority of the warming goes to melting ice -- *_not_* in "scorching the planet."

Stossel does a great job of making the argument that we have to be mindful of our priorities given that the government doesn&#39;t have endless resources and a dollar spent on climate change is a dollar not spent on, for instance, reducing our enormous national debt.

But it's an important point that this consensus debate is not clearly understood by the public. As is stated in the video even if there WAS a 97% consensus it wasn't for the idea that man-made gases are going to cause a catastrophe. The earth is warming - Yes. CO2 can cause warming - Yes But HOW MUCH warming AND is the warming CATASTROPHIC? Nope no 97% consensus on these most important aspects. In fact there isn't any consensus on whether warming could be beneficial. I guess nobody is getting any money to try and study this question. Lastly I applaud the new abbreviation that helps to clarify the root points of the debate - CAGW. The C is added to stand for the word Catastrophic as in Catastrophic Anthropomorphic Global Warming.

Since the Bolshevik Empire had the largest and most powerful chemical weapons arsenal in the world, it would make sense that their Ba'ath socialist ally would have that capability as well. It is no mistake that both Ba'athist Iraq and Ba'athist Syria deliberately used chemical weapons against civilian populations. In fact, it's part of Red Army doctrine to do so. The only people claiming the US had anything to do with it are the Bolsheviks and their old Left fascist allies in the West. It's the same Left fascists who so desperately tried to protect the outrageously nasty regime of Saddam Hussein (because, and only because, he was an ally of the Left fascists). This is why they are still furious that Saddam Hussein was "illegally" turned over to his people for punishment. To Left fascists, there never is a justification for deposing a Left fascist tyrant. That's why Bashar Assad is still in power. Like I said before - this certainly isn't the first time that socialists have pursued their odious self interests by being deliberately full of shit.

The Wmd's claim was just a damn distraction from what was really going on. Do you seriously think that the US government "cares" about whether the Iraqi citizens were being killed by Saddaam? Our government murdered many more than Hussein ever did with or without chemicals. Hussein was being punished for not overthrowing the Iranian government. That is why he had US and GB chemical weapons. But he failed. The Gulf War was revenge for his failure to overthrow the Iranian government and return the oilfields to BP. And it is not my "liberal news". The lamestream media whether left or right is absolute crap. They sell advertisements based on sensationalism.

Give more power to the government and corporations so they can make our lives even more miserable. If the sea levels rise, then we will adapt. Move further inland. In the meantime, I will continue to conserve energy and not release any toxic chemicals. I don't even use chemicals on my yard or garden. Everybody should follow suit. Enough of these ridiculous green and manicured lawns. Stop falling for the fear mongering that relieves you of your liberty.

And we know that for a fact because Great Britain and the United States provided them. They wanted Saddaam to invade Iran and overthrow their government so BP could get their oil fields back. What was found after the invasion of Gulf Blunder War Two was the remains of chemical weapons that were buried in the rubble of the buildings that were bombed in number One. We have no business invading other countries. If you like terrorism, then the continual mucking with the internal affairs of other countries will ensure a perpetual war of attrition in lives and our liberties.

UN weapons inspectors had cataloged these stockpiles. They DID exist. As for 911... yeah no. But again Bush never said we were going into Iraq over 911. We went because they had been firing at our planes for like 10 years and he did have chemical weapons and was supposedly working towards getting a nuke. Our mistake was to kick Saddam Hussein butt and they not just leave. Lesson learned hopefully.

When CO2 fell down to 800 ppm (2x today), many different plant species, worldwide evolved C4 species to cope with the CO2 starvation. About 15,000 BC, CO2 came to within 30 ppm of *_CO2 Mass Extinction._* The Biggest Oil Rockefellers and their ilk who created this "climate change" scam don't care about the environment. They merely want every possible method at their disposal for taking over the planet and ridding the world of those who do not share their sick plan. Damn creative of them, by psychopathically genocidal.	UCuhhX9p8cfLJTP5m5lm6z6Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuhhX9p8cfLJTP5m5lm6z6Q	1	UgjVfcRyzLUS4XgCoAEC	Jose Pineda
