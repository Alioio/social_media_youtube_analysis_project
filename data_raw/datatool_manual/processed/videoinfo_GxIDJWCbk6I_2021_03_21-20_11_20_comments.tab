UgyIFYgEGfi1cll92bx4AaABAg	84	1126	2019-06-12 15:46:13	Vox	If you want to read about the Green New Deal in the lens of the 2020 election, I recommend this piece explaining Washington Gov. Jay Inslee’s proposal: <a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/5/4/18527458/climate-change-jay-inslee-for-president-2020">https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/5/4/18527458/climate-change-jay-inslee-for-president-2020</a><br /><br /><br />Inslee has the most ambitious climate proposals; it is, as Vox&#39;s David Roberts writes, the Green New Deal translated into policy.<br /><br /><br />For more from the rest of the 2020 democratic field, check out the Vox policy guide: <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/4/23/18304657/vox-guide-2020-democratic-policy-primary#Climate%20change">https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/4/23/18304657/vox-guide-2020-democratic-policy-primary#Climate%20change</a> <br /><br /><br />– Alvin	UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA	0

A Republic Is A Form Of Government Under Which Democracy Operates In A Distinct Manner, Dependent Upon The Type Of Republic; The United States Of America Is Supposed To Be A Constitutional Republic, Comprised Of Multiple Free And Sovereign Republics, Bound Together In Public Trust By A Lawful Contractual Document, Which Is Duly Writ, Framed And Designated, As An Inheritance In Trust, To Be Protected And Maintained Inviolate By Those Public Trustees To The Benefit Of The Beneficiaries, In The Full Honor And Bound Duty Of Sworn Oath. I Agree, That There Are Some Taxes Which Are Necessary To Establish And Maintain Civilization; Redundant Taxes Upon Basic Necessities And Land Taxes On Small Acreage Homesteads Are Not Among Those Necessary Taxes. Our Tax Rate In America, When All Taxes Are Properly Summated, Is Already At +70%.	UCgmbRzuujH6S6yKecZlq5Ig	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgmbRzuujH6S6yKecZlq5Ig	1	UgyIFYgEGfi1cll92bx4AaABAg	Vox

At the end it is said that we all know that thr end of the world is coming, which is not true because noone knows for sure. And the sad part is the argument to support Green New Deal is based on the this last fact which is wrongly presented.

UgyIFYgEGfi1cll92bx4AaABAg.8w4stH6lpq29A-5Uqcduty		0	2020-06-17 05:40:33	Audio Pervert	The dominant discourse of the mainstream environmental movement is about the preservation of our lifestyles by adopting new 'green' technologies. That principle tenet is placed above everything else that the mainstream environmental agencies may claim or actually do. Preserving the very culture and lifestyle which is killing the planet. The crux of the environmental movement today, which is western (and predominantly white) is about the continuation of capitalism and exploitation (i.e using the planet to feed human greed - not addressing the actual needs). Leading environmental organisations, along with scores of scientists and environmental activists actually view the Earth as a resource and not as a living entity. During the last 30 years, the environmental movement has been gradually botched and hijacked by neoliberalism and big-money, manifesting via many new eco-friendly mantras, new technologies and the green new 'deal'. What deal can we as a species make with mother nature?	UChiiv3OpL09LEtZOQ5LkGmw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UChiiv3OpL09LEtZOQ5LkGmw	1	UgyIFYgEGfi1cll92bx4AaABAg	Vox

It was much hotter in the Jurassic period. What happened? Ice age. Dinosaurs gone. Mammals take over. Were Saber Tooth Cats driving volkswagen diesels and caused the ice age to end?

America causes very little pollution and over the last half decade decreased American Carbon Emissions 2. The Green New Deal only affects America and thus will not effect the global stage on climate change 3. The GND will only throw America into another economic downturn, causing the people who don't have enough money to learn skills will lose jobs, and only some can keep them. 4. Talk to China, India, or the other African countries that have to worry about their staving population because Democrats blocked giving food to them so the Africans could deal with their pollution. Plus China won't pass regulations on their pollution. Don't hurt America because of people who you didn't want to help, and those who don't care.

Pollute a ton and have zero emissions standards. There are no catalytic converters on planes, thus the "chemtrails". Second, just one cargo container ship, the length of around six football pitches, can produce the same amount of pollution as 50 million cars. These ships burn the dirtiest fuel around because it's cheap and because they can. Yet nobody cares about these international emissions because it's BIG BUSINESS and MONEY TALKS. Meanwhile in Canada BC I am paying record high gasoline prices.	UCJNCMznEHb50DsluZu__R7g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJNCMznEHb50DsluZu__R7g	1	UgyIFYgEGfi1cll92bx4AaABAg	Vox

But going cold turkey with our dependece on fossils is not the short term answer. We have to strive for a gradual and smooth transition.

Climate change moves us out of the climate the Earth has had since the last ice age. That's the problem. We built our cities, countries and farming industry with the climate we've recently have, in the future it will be different. Which means we can't use historical data to guide decisions. It means farmers may not be able to produce as much food due to possible less viable farmland. It means we will have to rebuild our infrastructure to cope with more storms in those places that we have more people living in. It also means places will be abandoned due us unable to further live there, Look up future of Christmas Island. Don't forget that we humans plan on having more of us on this planet, meaning more will be affected. The negatives from the unknowns of climate change are in fact dunting.

Rebuild every building in America to be energy efficient, get rid of all farting cows, jobs for those unwilling to work, trains faster than planes that can somehow even cross the ocean to get rid of the need for planes among other things. This sounds all nice and fluffy but is it worth destroying the economy with trillions more in debt just in the hope that miners will learn all of the sudden how to operate and build this eco-friendly plan? It&#39;s going to need a TON of skilled workers that just aren&#39;t there, the demand would be too high. Should we just give money away to people who say they don&#39;t want to work like the green new deal says? I think there will be plenty of people wanting free money. Even if all of these things go according to plan in the next ten years, the US accounts for 15% percent of carbon emissions. What are we going to do about the other 85%? Is places like China also going to follow this perfectly along with the rest of the world? I think we should do something about pollution but not in this way. Maybe start using nuclear more or convert the pollution into energy and fuel so we don&#39;t have to throw away planes and cars. Just spitballing but definitely not the green new deal.

(220ppm) Today it is 0.041% (410ppm). Some say it should be 220ppm and some say 350ppm. But what nobody can tell you is how to get there. Infact the global lockdown failed to reduce it by a single ppm. It is probably ultimately futile. The reason why no one talks about this is because they all want a part of those billions of climate dollars.

Where, for example, is the energy to drive the Green New Deal coming from. Solar and wind, ok, so because the sun foes not always shine and Mr. wind does not always blow. the energy they produce must be stored, how and where. Batteries or hydro, batteries are VERY polluting to the environment. Not just the heavy metals, but the extraction of those metals from mother earth. Hydro means more dams, again an effect on the environment. So, not that moving away from fossil fuels is important, but moving without thinking about how and the consequences just leads to more problems.

Destroying the oil&amp;gas industry in America will not solve the problem. It will only lead other countries, with poor environmental regulations, to ramp up operations to meet the demand. Other countries will simply fill in for the lack of supply because until we can turn into a carbon-less society (no plastic, no gas, no diesel, no propane, no butane, no chlorine, no fertilizer, and the list goes on!!) the demand for oil will remain the same and this green new deal will inadvertently hurt our planet even more.

They scheduled a climate seminar in these people we&#39;re invited and none of them attended the seminar. My question is why do all of them have their own agenda to the point where they won&#39;t look at any other scientific developments they should be sitting at the table deciding how we&#39;re going to live in a warmer more human climate because any scientific person should realize that everything in nature changes nothing stays the same	UCJoxRaRYPU5aA0iQx639WIA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJoxRaRYPU5aA0iQx639WIA	0

You would need to cover the entire Atlantic ocean with solar panels for amount of energy that is consumed from America. The sun doesn&#39;t always shine and the wind doesn&#39;t always blow. I&#39;m not saying we don&#39;t do anything but the process to reform the energy industry will take decades to do it so it is done without disruption of power. <br />It will need an entire new infrastructure to distribute the power and storage facilities to store it. Plus your using hundreds or barrels of oil in machines to excavate materials monthly to make batteries which is completely counter productive. Hydro Electric is great but has the problem of distribution so it&#39;s geographically locked in. Electric vehicles get electric from grid that uses majority of fossil fuels to make electric and fossil fuels to get materials to make batteries. Counter productive. If net zero is the goal than why not nuclear power since it is a net zero power producer. Is it expensive to build, yes. Is it safe, YES. It is a proven energy producer. Why not focus on more efficient energy equipment for buildings or homes with huge incentives to switch to these. People can&#39;t afford to buy $12k to $20k HVAC systems just cause you want them to switch. If homes are to have a new standard to be built this is great but it comes at a cost. Usually much higher with new standard&#39;s. They need help to do these transitions quickly if this is the goal. <br />Plus you are asking people to change their lifestyle and way of living. This doesn&#39;t go over well....	UC42XRTWJrQ1yHlihrGNVpRA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC42XRTWJrQ1yHlihrGNVpRA	0

There are solar panels on roofs all over Europe. Change happens slowly and then WOOOSH! the change has happened. When was the last time you rode to town in a horse and cart?

It's very possible that the government alone can not pay for such a thing and will need to tax a lot, in addition to getting rid of jobs who make emissions. Both of these factors might mean some people lose their jobs. And in a backward country like the United States, your job is your social security. So it would force people into poverty if no action is taken to counter this. But on a long period, it's likely that it wouldn't change so much	UCu-W6c6wBQZ7M2ZPny98l7Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu-W6c6wBQZ7M2ZPny98l7Q	1	UgyO0d3ZkcRt2JLELSF4AaABAg	Wiktor Jachyra

Instead, they pretend that their Green New Deal is going to create new jobs that will outweigh all the jobs lost as a result of the plan, which isn&#39;t true. That&#39;s why nobody trusts them and that&#39;s why nobody wants to implement their plan.	UC5u8D7teXx8Jk4fDUMNLi2Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5u8D7teXx8Jk4fDUMNLi2Q	0

Ugyi5dg_kXahZo3t73Z4AaABAg	0	0	2020-12-13 22:54:01	ChitarraStelle	EU Green Deal ::: EU leaders advertise this 55% emission reduction target to 2030, but they do not mention THEY USE 1990 AS BASELINE !!! Since 1990, EU emissions declined already 25% until 2019, so THE EU TARGET IS ONLY 22.5% REDUCTION IN TODAY&#39;S TERMS. The UNEP&#39;s Emissions Gap Report 2020, just out a few days ago, states the need for (in GtCo2e) 34/59 = 57% cut - from TODAY&#39;S emissions - at 2030, to stay below 1.5° (as per Paris Agreement goals) with 66% probability. The EU 2030 target is 22.5% instead of 57% and therefore THE EU GREEN DEAL IS NOT AT ALL ALIGNED TO THE PARIS AGREEMENT and the target is absolutely insufficient to face the climate crisis.<br />A &quot;Just Transition&quot; is a transition that GETS DONE ON TIME, (not only at 2050 but also at the 2030 milestone to avoid overshooting trajectories with irreversible consequences), so as to be JUST towards the TENS OF MILLIONS who could get a job out of a transition in the present (many more than those who hold a job in inherently destructive sectors), and the BILLIONS of people in future decades and centuries who will not have to suffer the consequences of a changed climate - all that to preserve the interests of much fewer people in existing industries in 2020, interests which in most cases can be protected anyway.

The only reasonable suggestion is to have nuclear power as our main source of energy but that still doesn’t solve other things like cars sense reasonably we couldn’t full have electric cars due to the range limits. We wouldn’t be able to make enough electricity to Power that much electric cars besides that fact of homes and businesses that we would take up power to. We would also lose Power overnight if we went to solar send we wouldn’t have enough batteries to Store power overnight.

Their idea is to keep on the track we are on right now. Make cars more fuel efficient, increase nuclear power, decrease carbon emissions. While at the same time, Carbon Emissions makes these massive $500 million plants that use machinery to speed up the carbon cycle in the air. One of these plants is able to cancel out the annual emissions of 250,000 vehicles. If we use a 1/50th of the money allocated towards the GND, we could cancel out the emissions of 500,000,000 vehicles. That’s incredible!!

The Amazon Rain Forest has been referred to as the lungs of the earth for decades. Stop the deforestation of the Amazon Rain Forest and CO2 levels will stabilize. Global temperatures were higher than they are now during the Medieval Warm Period, they didn&#39;t have SUV&#39;s and Diesel trucks back then so what caused it, volcanoes, drought, solar intensity...nobody knows. That warm period transitioned into the &#39;Mini Ice age&#39; just 10K years ago. The earth&#39;s climate will change, it is a natural cycle and there is nothing we can do about it. Eventually the earth will start a cooling cycle and edge toward another ice age. In the 70&#39;s the hot topic was global cooling, oh how things conveniently change. It&#39;s all driven by money.

Thirdly, the second part of the deal must be implemented en masse before any part of the first can even be considered. Many years, and possibly another World War, before all three of those problems can be rectified. Maybe they need another part of the deal created to solve the obvious duh issues, before working on the first two.	UC68u3ILtupCxCJViNX5XMlA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC68u3ILtupCxCJViNX5XMlA	0

Their intentions may be good, I hope, but it is a terrible devastating idea. Just do your research and don&#39;t be so naive to think that you can manage the lives of billions of people in transition while discriminating based on race and class even though that&#39;s what you&#39;re pretending not to do. Let&#39;s fight this people, although I have faith that most American people are competent enough to realize that it is a bad idea.

It’s not only that millions will lose their jobs but that our economy heavily depends on the fossil fuel sector and if that collapses then simply so does our economy. This is a socialist daydream and there is many alternatives which will guarantee the protection of these people and the economy such as putting more funding into fusion research or perhaps making rooftop farms or perhaps making a city that combines different energy sources instead of depending on one.

We don&#39;t have the technology needed to extract green energy to meet our growing demand efficiently. But the video doesn&#39;t talk about that.

We had an explosion of animal life an plant life about 545 million years ago when the average temperature on earth was around 25 degrees and the Atmospheric Co2 was on about 7000 PPM! Most of the time in the last 600 millions years the average temperature on earth has been around 25 degrees, with exemptions of relatively small periods with low temperature around 10 degrees average. We are in such a period now for the first time in 300 million years and it&#39;s getting warmer over the next million years or so.

This is 2020. Old jobs will be gone and new jobs will be created. You HAVE to move on with the times. Your forefathers brought you here to work in coal. Why are you feeling so entitled that you don&#39;t have to do the same?????? I am sorry but with Biden now being the President, you HAVE to think of a new way to survive. Yes, coal WAS important (&#39;was&#39; being the keyword here). Not anymore. You speak out of fear. Scientist speak out of evidence and numbers. You have nothing other than emotions. One more thing, do you want your child to live in a world with severe climate change? The rest of you here, you are speaking in an echo chamber, secretly fearing the truth and asking for others to affirm your belief. That is why you all are supporting each other, Out of fear. Let go of coal... so that others may live.	UCGHwB5X-tja_DJ7vUj-yV7Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGHwB5X-tja_DJ7vUj-yV7Q	0

While doing it it was obvious that the ONLY way to stop emissions looks like a miracle, a new technology we haven’t developed yet. In that sense inversion in research and development should be ever government’s priority. I’ve listened to AOC as much as I could and with all respect, even though she is passionate, charismatic and smart, she is always making claims that have not logic regarding economics, I know she is an economist (I am too), but I’m sure she is where she is not for her economic skills but for her political skills. That’s why they only have 14 pages for this deal, because all the variables that would need to be analyzed and considered are way too complex to accomplish via government intervention. Climate change is real and some of the smartest scientists in the world are working to stop it. But politicians, all politicians, they love to make promises. To me, this whole idea sounds like Greta saying “I want you to feel panic” rather than actually giving feasible, structured and mathematically posible solutions. The intention is good, but it is a shallow statement.	UCqYMaPAtdYa8f9cDV8EDuVw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqYMaPAtdYa8f9cDV8EDuVw	0

The long term solution will involve a greater reliance on nuclear power. It has the growth capacity to handle a thriving economy. Sadly, renewables do not.

It’s up to the producing nations to make the difference. Also why did they specify that people of color will be hit hardest?

And if you have more energy then you can spend you must pay someone to spend it for you. That&#39;s what Germany does and California also. Because batteries are bad for the nature. Also, what do you think happens when 25 years pass by and solar pannels are useles. You recicycle them right? Wrong, they get shipped into the third world and there people are exposed to led. As a better solution there is nuclear. You might say oh there have been accidents on big scales. Yes 7 of them. They didn&#39;t do that much demage. There is Chernobyl which was caused by fire so that won&#39;t happen in the future. But what to do with waste? You store it. Each person in modern world would produce about a coke can of volume in their lifetime. But people are scared so no nuclear...

I don&#39;t like the idea of government lead banning of fossil fuels and fracking - they make up 5.6% of the US jobs - and I would have it this way. Renewable energy is becoming exponentially cheaper and more efficient and in the mere space of 2 decades, its become more efficient than fossil fuels, not sure about natural gas. I think that if economics works like how I think it does, the free market will transition itself to renewables autonomously without government interference and from the sources I&#39;ve read, this is already true, coal and mining factories are being retired already and wind and solar make up 95% of new energy. I&#39;m optimistic for the future and believe in climate activism in some part but fundamentally disagree with the Green New Deal and how it plans to phase out emissions and I think a lot of people who don&#39;t support the Green New Deal would have similar views.

The whole world economy and every business depends on oil to run so the combine wouldn’t just suffer it would crash and I do t think it could recover from a full crash especially if fossil fuels are banned. I agree we need a better energy source than oil but the technology isn’t there yet and until we definitively have a cheap renewable energy source this will only end badly for the poor because it’s them that will suffer not the rich.

It frustrates me terribly that the republican party refuses to acknowledge Climate change as a legitimate threat to society itself and turned the very existence of climate change into a political opinion. Having that said, I do not think the green new deal is the way out. The &quot;part 2&quot; of the green new deal is basically a political move on part of democratic socialists to push political agendas. And I totally believe when they say they hold the good of the people at heart but in regards to climate change lots of investment and economic shift needs to take place and it is definitely not the time to scare away companies with social reform when they would be essential to this transition. We need to make the change to renewable energy as profitable as possible to incentivize corporations and industries to stay in America and carry out this transition by aiding the government and diversifying the new markets. Socialism does not equal Climate change and americans (republicans and democrats) need to wake up to this fact.	UCCc-9wACMALXHnp47CkNOLQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCc-9wACMALXHnp47CkNOLQ	0

For the second part pure socialism is as bad as unregulated capitalism. No sane person is arguing for the rampant inefficiencies of soviet style communism, people want a fair society with no one being disadvantaged for things out of their control. Everyone wouldn’t have the same paycheck, wealth would just be more evenly distributed.

It can not happen and if they try it. it will completely destroy Americas economy it will not help the poor it will hurt them along with everyone else in the usa I dont know how anyone thinks this is a good idea.nevermind the tens of trillion it will cost but in order to switch to 0 carbon emissions you&#39;ll need to create high power batteries along with other things to power the country and you can only get the materials needed for these things in the ground which means you have to dig them up using oil and gas to power the machinery meaning that they will still be burning fossil fuel and maybe something like this could be done over a 50 or 60 year period but not in less than 10 years.<br /><br />They are also proposing to get rid of nuclear plants even though they are a great source of energy and produce 0 carbon emissions.<br />I think the idea would not work without slowing decreasing carbon emissions over a long period and also no one country can stabilise climate change so even if America 100% got rid of fossil fuels climate change would still be a problem as most carbon emissions come from China and India.<br /><br />JUST MY THOUGHTS WOULD LOVE TO HEAR YOUR OPINIONS 😁😁😁	UCXb3wKnBEjYwdAd3GWzKgAg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXb3wKnBEjYwdAd3GWzKgAg	0

Also you won't start another Cold War, an arms race? Maybe, but a Cold War? Not likely, countries like China or Russia that you'd think would go to war with us are dependent on us as we are to them. China makes goods, U.S buys their goods. Take away China and the U.S has no one to buy from or have manufacturers for cheap products. Take away the U.S And China has no one to buy from them.

The safe leves are said to be from 200 ppm to a little over 400 ppm.

There are a lot of innovations happening in the nuclear industry these past years. New gen reactors are more efficient now, so less nuclear waste and much more safer. Even the old nuclear reactors are much more safer than coal if you look at deaths statistics. Also Thorium reactors are right around the corner thats a game changer 0% chance of meltdown.

Nuclear might be cheaper and vastly more efficient than other methods long-term, but the up-front cost of building and beginning operations of a nuclear facility is astronomical.

According to Americans for Lightsource it would take about 900,000 solar panels to run a steel mill, more if its integrated. There are 9 integrated mills in America and lots more non integrated. So if we make 10 times more solar panels than currently exist we can make the steel for renewable energy. But you can double that for mining and logistics. The solar farm in Carolina has 5040 solar panels and takes up 4.8 acres so 111,000 acres. That doesnt even include the actual manufacturing facilities to process the raw steel. Where will you put all this? Turning the state of Kansas into a solar farm wouldnt scratch the surface. Solar panel manufacturering is an extremely electricity heavy process. I'm all for green energy but at the moment it's not possible.	UCrpJTlfcouUglrz_pMej8lg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrpJTlfcouUglrz_pMej8lg	1	UgwKfcjrUCPZkBlos5h4AaABAg	M14lvr

I wish we could go back to the gold standard so that countries could not run their printing presses like the U.S. right now. Yeah, the U.S. can print their way out, since the dollar is the world's reserve currency. Many economists are predicting a collapse of the dollar.

Infact the US is probably the only one who can do this extensively without massive hyperinflation I think mostly because the dollar is a world currency. So long as everyone still uses the dollar for international trade and most of the printed dollars go overseas, the ammount of dollars in circulation must be compared to the goods created by world. Eventually it will saturate but this is perhaps the reason why it hasn't happened yet and may be still a long time from now.

Of course the world says jump on board United States. They don't want to pay for it. And they can't even live by their own words now lol I'm not even going to go into detail on how the ice melting is releasing tons of gases to combat any effects of the 1% of carbon element in the entire atmosphere. You want drastic change, keep irresponsible people from having babies. Less drain on everyone else having to foot the bill for a choice that wasn't theirs. Hey so and so, heres more money for every kid you pump out and take care property! And when those kids you have fail in school, go to jail for to lack of proper care, etc etc. No worries, the government will keep rewording you for bad behavior! That way when we vote in the next 20 yrs, we will promote more social welfare programs that inflate like a bubble! No worries we will just keep pulling funds from places they are supposed to go like the military!

Solar energy comes from the sun&#39;s rays, one hundred percent nature and of no harm to the environment, plus it is inexhaustible if the solar systems star (the sun) is still burning. Where geothermal power using the energy that is being emitted from the radioactive materials that are decomposing in the earths ground, the radioactive materials are harmful to the planet, therefore the best choice of renewable energy source would be solar energy.

The blades on windmills are plastic requiring petrochemical processes to manufacture. In reality, the new green deal will result in nuclear energy as the saviour when all the green dreaming fails. Who knows, not too wild to suggest that helium3 might be extracted from the moon. Gotta reason that solar and wind equipment will be obsolete faster than it will become globally implemented.

They will claim we don’t have the money but they just gave big businesses trillions of dollars in relief aid. You notice they ones claiming are the old white wealth white people that no it more to this deal. This deal if given as promised could be the first step to erasing history and making a new one.

I understand the world problem we are currently experiencing and the mass amounts of catastrophes that may ensue in the nearby future if actions are not taken. <br />If it happens, it happens. That is my perception of life and death—a cycle. But if we can put a halt to the potential disarray, we need to do it together. Not divided. So what&#39;s up with all of this Division?

First, most renewables are just not available or reliable enough to be a realistic source for 100% of needs. And, to store vast amounts of power for the gaps in availability using batteries requires a ton of - guess what - fossil fuels to allow for producing batteries which require massive amounts of mining and de-forestation. I&#39;ve been in the Energy Conservation business for close to 30 years and I&#39;m all in favor of reducing carbon emissions and the positive effect of this on the planet but, have any of these Green New Deal creators consulted scientists in the &#39;unintended consequences&#39; Department?

It would ban exports to fossil fuels to developing countries which is a terrible idea not just according to me but the World Bank and International Energy Agency. It would end the natural gas industry which is doing more to reduce carbon emissions that whatever govt plans progressives in congress . It completely ignores the potential of the free market and innovation. For example the hydrogen industry and the carbon capture industry have the potential to become multi trillion dollar industries. And even reasonable reforms like the carbon tax and dividend are ignored. It completely ignores the inefficiency of Bureaucracy. And I’m not even going to get into the cow killings and plane bannings. All in all the green new deal is a disaster.

If you think that only the coal miners will be losing their job, you’re wrong. International trade would be infeasible without gigantic oil powered ships, rolling blackouts/brownouts end up common like in California. Stifling the economy while increasing government spending, with increased taxes to go with it, sounds to me like a recipe for disaster.

Fear that the earth will drastically change in let&#39;s say 12 years. Remember Al Gore on the Arctic Ice pack would be non-existent in the summer of 2012? Certainly climate change happens but it also takes a very long time for the earth climate to change dramatically. I would be thinking of thousands or even millions of years. After all the earth is about 4.5 billions of years old. The video starts out with this is a group of the worlds best climatologists. One might say this is a group of like-minded climatologists. These people seem very determined to save the world and mould it as they see fit. They want to tell you how you will live, how to build a house, what type of transportation you will drive. They feel fossil fuels are no longer acceptable. Just wondering how they are going to have a conference with no planes? They don&#39;t like that food is transported great distances to feed people. The Green New Deal is a socialist agenda that calls for the government to control everything you do. Think about it. It is also very questionable as to how their data was compiled to arrive at the conclusions they say are accurate. They also like to blame &quot;climate change &quot; for every wildfire, tornado, hurricane, etc..., yet reality tells up we have always had these natural disasters. To accept these so-called experts opinions and possibly manipulated data just may be sending us down a path that is not necessary. Just maybe the earth&#39;s &quot;normal temperature&quot; is a bit warmer than now.	UCr5_3owqTRontQ850VvodwQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr5_3owqTRontQ850VvodwQ	0

The way you heat your home? The way you have electricity in your home? The corporations have to adapt to provide YOU with what YOU demand.

Economic security for the unemployed(Basically providing people who are unemployed a monthly stipend for not having a job)<br />3.

Does the rest of the world get a free pass? No one ever mentions how our military, which depends heavily on gas and oil, will be able to protect our country if all that goes away. Warplanes, tanks, ships etc need fossil fuels. There&#39;s no way around it. The GND would facilitate having to get rid of the airlines. Would the pilots be transitioned into another job, earning what they earn now? There are 10 million people working in the airline business. The oil and gas industries have 9.8 million workers. 1.7 million people are employed by the auto industry. I&#39;m assuming the workers in the auto industry can easily transition into making electric vehicles, but there&#39;s articles saying it will take way less workers to produce these cars. I live on the west coast but my family lives on the east coast. If I want to visit or God forbid, attend a funeral, how long will it take me to get from here to there? And of course back again. Non-stop by plane is 4 and a half hours. I can make it by car in 3 days if I push it. There would literately need to be hundreds, perhaps thousands of recharging stations throughout the country. Every charging station I drove by had a vehicle hooked up to it. If I had an electric car then and needed a charge, I&#39;d be SOL.

Solar energy needs lots of resources to build, wind needs massive plastic turbines that expire and need to be buried, hydro power can destroy river habitats and harm farming downstream, coal produces and great deal of pollution, fracking wastes alot of water qnd poisons the soil.

Solar & wind are not reliable forms of energy. They only work as intended when the sky is clear (solar) & windy (windmills) . Cows do produce greenhouse gases, but getting rid of cow farming will have a devastating toll on the food supply & millions will starve. Capitalism gives everyone equal opportunity no matter what your bank account looks like or the color of your skin & to think otherwise is wrong, ive seen people from borderline homeless, become very successful because Capitalism allowed them too. Capitalism will only truly benefit the people who work hard for what they want, & if you think that you shouldnt have to work hard for nice things, & just be handed money by the Gov for not benefiting to society & your community then you are just lazy & entitled. Socialism or Democratic Socialism do not work, & all these countries people use as examples for "Democratic Socialism" such as Sweden & Denmark, actually have more Capitalism & less bureaucratic red tape on them than any other country except for New Zealand. Which is why they are moving more & more away from public healthcare & pushing more private healthcare. These countries are not good examples for another reason which is population, New York has 3.3x the population of Denmark alone, & 8M more than Sweden. The average person in Denmark pays 50% of their pay towards taxes. That is not a way i would like to live, idk about you.

These energy forms are killing wild animals , fish, trees and even ourselves.Cow farming produces greenhouse gases and its takes insanely large land, displacing the natural world . Capitalism beneficieries and big tech companies exploit the working class for greater profits this feeds into greed and brings about inequality of opportunity Capitalism has selfish &horrendous tendencies but yes it has brought us amazing things such as innovation, on the other hand socialism is very susceptible to disastrous outcomes despite its good intention this mainly comes from greed and corruption e.g china. therefore in my opinion the best solution for everyone would be democratic socialism.

Not this power grab of a lie, equal opportunity will disappear if this is implemented. They will have control over car industry, energy industry, agriculture industry, & much more. This deal would eliminate cows from farming here completely, how does that help anyone? 99% of the things we have today in this world are because of Capitalism and the innovation that the free market allows. Socialism never works, just look at all the countries that have tried socialism, Venezuela, Cuba, & the Soviet Union. Educate yourself on government & you will see a Capitalist economy wins everytime.	UCboJtBYqJ_l12a26l_uWDaQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCboJtBYqJ_l12a26l_uWDaQ	1	UgxwuMk01gZVenFUvMh4AaABAg	Chimmy

We have the majority of the materials necessary. - There are other types of power, many more than oil - We have enough - We will build where is necessary - We have already cut down way more than enough to build windmills - How do we pay for the military? For the police? - You're idiotic, we breathe out CO2, but we don't breathe out an excess of it. We don't need 0 emissions, just way fewer. - It's not about you. - Thats not yours to decide.

It has created distrust of science because, unlike scientists, the news and media do not say, "maybe", "might", "suggests", "could", etc. Politicians and media say things like the earth is going to end in 5 years or xyz is 300% more likely (when talking about 99.9% vs 99.6%).

It would have to be an unbelievable coincidence for a natural factor to start making the Earth warmer as soon as we start burning fossil fuels. Although, that coincidence isn’t impossible. So, we can look at some of the countries with the relatively same temperature for a long time. Those countries are the same countries with little emissions, and highest percentages of electric car usage. I hope you aren’t disagreeing that fossil fuel emissions make the Earth warmer, because if you are, you’re simply just disagreeing with every scientist and every scientific study ever. Climate change is a serious problem and requires a serious response . We shouldn’t put future generations in danger because we didn’t want to spend the money. On top of that, if scientists are correct and climate change is a human caused issue, then if we don’t do something now, future generations will have to pay 3x what we will have to pay now to fix it, and by then, it will be too late to save the Earth. That is completely selfish. People try to politicize global warming and The Green New Deal and that just should not happen. It’s a very real threat and shouldn’t be ignored.

Now kids learn about this stuff so we have more knowledge and are not stuck in our ways like old people. We are more willing and educated in topics that affect us. Old people were not affected by climate change so they don’t care as much. They were more focused in money after the recession so that is what they focus on because that is what was taught to them. We are taught about climate change in school and in the news, to us that our future.	UCAVsZPkCwtQMwxLO3jdNgbQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAVsZPkCwtQMwxLO3jdNgbQ	0

Electric cars must be used, even though they release massive amounts of emmision when their battery is built. Once their is more job loss than the great depression, give taxpayer money to businesses and force them to hire EVERYONE UNEMPLOYED, even if they don&#39;t want to because some people are terrible fits for a job. There isn&#39;t enough money that the government could possibly collect to pay for this either, as taxing the rich 90% or whatever that nut wants will make most or all the rich move out of the country.

So the plan is to bankrupt yourselves and then be toasted anyway because the brainiacs behind your GND forgot that the US only accounts for 15% of the carbon emission problem. That would be a shocking oversight if it were true - but of course it isn&#39;t true. In reality the GDN has nothing to do with saving the planet - I mean obviously; just do the math - and everything to do with taking down capitalism and freedom. Sorry to be a grown-up, but you know... sometimes the obvious needs to be pointed out.	UCUNpNjMCfH9YD3lUxOAw0vA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUNpNjMCfH9YD3lUxOAw0vA	0

I agree, of course America can't tell other countries what to do. I wasn't suggesting they could. Quite the opposite - I'm pointing out that the GND is being sold to US voters as if it'll save the world when of course it won't and can't. And so you have to question why politicians are selling this lie to the voters? A worldwide problem can only be solved by worldwide action. But socialism in the US can be achieved by calling it something else. Something that'll save the planet.

There&#39;s a lot of evidence that shows electric energy wouldn&#39;t be much better for the environment. There&#39;s social policies that have nothing to do the environment. Most environmental scientist disagree that environmental change is or will be irreversible seeing as though climate change has occurred on earth on a much worse scale.<br /><br />The are other, better solutions than the $50-93 trillion green new deal. And that&#39;s the problem. It was a bad proposal based on bad science. Let&#39;s take logical steps like funding things like Carbon Engineering, let&#39;s explore thorium reactors, let&#39;s introduce tax penalties and tax incentives for carbon, let&#39;s use gmo&#39;s, and curb agricultural growth into wildlife habitats, and let&#39;s use a scientific methodology and not alarmist rhetoric	UCO2xrwhxiA8IXoVm8r5eQFw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO2xrwhxiA8IXoVm8r5eQFw	0

This would be something they have to do anyway when they hire new employees could the oil &amp; gas industries invest into these green companies and adapt and make a smoother transition?

The entire modern world is built on the foundation of fossil fuels - electricity, transportation, food, education, etc. Dismantling our carbon-based economy is such an incredibly huge monster to attack. So many angles to consider. How are electricity companies supposed to fight peak energy hours from 3-6pm without relying on coal power? How will every American replace their car? Can you mass-produce reasonably priced electric automobiles for over 200 million Americans in even 10 years? Where will companies like Ford/Toyota/Honda maintain their business when they secure millions of laborers, engineers, foremen, and salesmen with jobs? It&#39;s quite literally a trillion-dollar industry. If the Green New Deal is passed, the Democrats (I identify as neither) will need to come up with an extremely thorough, detailed, and long policy to completely dismantle what we know as our economy.

The point remains the same, China produces around 2x the CO2 of the us, and more than both the US and the entire EU combined - and while both the eu and the us have been reducing their footprint, Chiba is only accelerating. The industrial revolution happened 300 years ago. Yes China is starting to industrialise, but that doesn’t automatically excuse the CO2 they are creating. At the rate they are going, the entire world could stop CO2 emissions all together and still the world would not reach its climate target.

China has just gone thru it’s industrial revolution, while the US did more than a century ago, and I get that China still shouldn’t pump out that much, but when you consider that they are a country almost 4 times (population) the size of the US and the US did exactly the same back then, it becomes a largely irrelevant argument...

Now some farmers do, but most use huge combine harvesters. We used to drive in horses and carts. Now we use cars and we're steadily moving to electric cars. All over Europe and Australia, you can see solar panels and windmills. The same will happen in America as renewable energy becomes cheaper than coal, oil and gas which are steadily becoming the fuels of yesterday. The important thing is to make sure that those who used to be employed in coal, oil and gas can find new employment, whether it's with renewables or in some other area.

Knowing that we can actually contribute to people consuming pure water, habitats to continue their natural cycles, and provide a bit of a better future, shouldn't we strive for that? We could lead by example and show others that we are caring and compassionate and can help the world while also helping ourselves. Show that it can work. And if many others don't follow, at least we're doing our best to make this world a better place. It'll inspire, it'll entice change.

As long as there is time and energy and the building blocks (atoms, single cellular or even multicellular organisms) for life there will always be the potential for life (even humanoid) to thrive again on the surface of this particular planet.

My idea about the US changed in a way, after 2001, and all the aggression in the middle east. I was wondering, why are they wasting their money and their efforts on these ridiculous wars on the other side of the world? Why aren&#39;t they focusing on technology and changing society in a way that everyone is happier? Why aren&#39;t they pushing the modernization and the whole world forward? Instead, the US behaved like a bully who is safeguarding his position, entrenched in his castle... <br /><br />Then Mr. Donald Trump happened. I think you can see where I am going with this... Sure, there are still people like Elon Musk, who push us forward and turn our dreams into reality, but is it enough?<br /><br />My point is - please don&#39;t waste all of your potential on ridiculous backward policies and absurd nationalism. Climate change is real and we need to adapt to it, or this planet will continue spinning without us. The US is the leading economic and military power in the world. If you do not change your society and implement new technologies for the better of humanity, who will?	UC4W7qyIKpQzyPxJnC1urigQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4W7qyIKpQzyPxJnC1urigQ	0

And i am not saying he is some evil, but he is not a saviour he is made out to be, he is just a businessman. US government gave subsidies(massive) to businesses who want to venture into electric and space manufacturing business, he is a son of person who owns emerald mines. He was able to gather enough capital to avail those opportunities. His electric cars are unaffordable to majority of population, so is his solar powered home system.

The world has agreed that the worth of their currency is the same as the amount of gold in their treasury. So, by printing more bills, you lower the value of the $1 bill. You then crash the economy, putting us in almost another great depression. Personally, I see your point, after rereading it, but printing money to not distribute to the people will cause many a problem.

They too require electricity which is also dependent on fossil fuels. The problem with nuclear is the waste and what to do with it and that fusion supposedly should be better. But for now, just like in France who use mostly nuclear and emit some of the lowest in the world and actually have very low electricity rates, nuclear is the way.

What about &quot;make the use of oil, natural gas and coal illegal in the next 10 years&quot; &quot;People who are unwilling to work will still get public support &quot;Replace all air travel with high speed rails in 10 years&quot; and the plans would cost over 30 trillion dollars. Also China puts out 2 times the amount of co2 America does, they will never pass a law to limit their co2. This is not change, it is the rewriting of the entire country. Even if Socialists took control of the country they could never sell this to the American people.	UC3TMiai-HihN9WLZLGnhqjQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3TMiai-HihN9WLZLGnhqjQ	0

Take a look at france, where they generate 70% of their electricity using nuclear power plants. If the US were to reform their power generation like that you could already achieve a very significant reduction in CO2 emissions, without causing many issues. Then over time, as energy storage and generation technology improves, a more permanent solution can be developed.

Oh right, I forgot the country was capitalist and companies and rich people could get taxed more while they're paying so few taxes now. Shouldn't make them suffer a bit to save the people.

Even if you permanently ended all war (lul) you wouldn't even be able to pay for 1year of either of those programs. This isn't about rich people vs poor people. This is about reality versus fiction. The US military barely takes 15% of the entire budget, 64% is used in just those two programs.

And even if we get to 0 emmisions in the US that only brings the world down 15% when we need 50%. The best way is a global initiative that eases the way and allows the world to shift away from it by incentiving clean energy, not getting rid of all fossil fuels in 10 years, which is impossible without putting a gun to people's head and destroying the economy, all to not even get enough global emmisions down. Should we do something? Yes. Is the Green New Deal the answer? Unless you want to not even fully solve the problem and destroy the American economy, then no.

The also didn’t have to build their wealth in this current economy. Their homes, food, clothing and education were a small fraction of what it is now. It’s all the same product and teaching but now the cost is astronomical. I remember my parents telling me they paid $200 for an apartment that is $1600 today. The very same apartment building. I’ve seen photos of fast food costing less than a dollar. I still remember when as a kid I could take pennies and buy candy at 7-Eleven. These people and their greed have caused this to happen. Every year they want more and more money from us and are not will to stop. Profit over morality. These people swear on bibles. This should show you how hypocritical they are. So many believe them and it doesn’t matter the party theu belong to, they do the same just differently. It’s disgusting. Look at how other successful countries handle things and try to tell me how America is the greatest. Look at Sweden, Canada, Norway, Germany. Yes they pay for it but so do we and we still don’t get the quality they get because of American greed. America home of the frayed land of the greed.

I blame the deaths of over 374,000 Americans squarely at his door. Dr Fauci has been frantically trying to save people's lives but Trump's contradictory, lazy carelessness has confused many people. However, thank goodness, President Joe Biden immediately started tackling Covid as soon as he was elected. I don't think that Trump knows or cares what President Biden has been doing about Covid. He's just been obsessed with pretending that he won the election but at last has stopped pretending - now that his attitude has caused so much harm to democracy in America.

They clearly had radical motives in de-centralisation and the progression of liberalism which, in its consequence, resolved in the instability and corruption rates increasing. However, I do want to point out that the rates of corruption and instability are rising as speak, under our CURRENT government. As we know, protests for racial equality have occurred, yet the government still have not resolved the issue nor barely tapped into this matter, hence the ongoing outcry. Just today, as you may know, Trump supporters raiding the Capitol building, and for what? Trump's unwillingness to concede and admit his defeat, and "corrupting" the nation by dismantling the integrity of the election, and disenfranchising certain people and states for his own benefit. Not to mention his administration and first term genuinely attributed to the current rise in corruption, as you mention.

I am glad I grew up in a country where there was no technology or the internet. I am glad I got the chance to use analog equipment instead of digital. Thanks to where I came from, I got the chance to learn about life in the same way people who are in their 70s or 80s here in the US. But anyway I kind of blame technology for some of the issues you mentioned above. Nowadays we get happiness through our phones with social media. We don't physically connect as much as we used to back in the day. The environment someone grows up in also affects how strong that person would be.

It happens to every generation. Think about it, the 60s era hippies are governing us and this is what is happening? We should all be in communes and avoiding war like the plague, but we aren't.

Well it's a massive star in the heavens with a mass, i.e. m in the formula E=mc2, about 330,000 times earth's. That mass gives Hirgetos of this world the solar energy the hope to capture, not produce but capture, to transform into electricity via the photovoltaic process via solar panels which unfortunately are another "m" in the process which are produced from a whole bunch of "m"s starting with the rare earth elements which must be mined and processed into photo cells. Now if you believe they, who lived a thousand years ago, lived longer and "healthier" than today you must also believe the moon is made of Swiss cheese. As a retired chemical engineer I helped invent, design, develop and implement a few processes and products in our world today.

In my home country people carry AK47 and pistols but we don’t have shooting problems like America has because they are mature, warriors.... This people know the true meaning of patriotism. You know what the weird thing is, if someone carries an AK in my home country I wouldn’t be worried, instead I would feel proud of my country and people like who fought in battles to prevent us from being colonized by anyone. However if some immature, insecure guy carries a firearm, I would feel worried, I would prepare for any outcome. I will consider you as a warrior if you fought a battle against another strong country. Not a country with untrained troops or a country weaker that you. This people here are mentally ill, you don’t know when they will switch to someone else. Anyways this is my opinion, you don’t have to agree or disagree with it.

It’s more like a wishlist for the short term. They’re trying to tackle an issue that is ridiculously complicated. You have to remember the driving force of our economy: self interest. People aren’t going to stop consuming earths resources tomorrow. They’re not gonna stop driving cars to get to work, and they’re not gonna give up electricity in their homes. All of the renewable sources of energy is also too costly. You also have to take in the geographic limitations into consideration as well as the storage capabilities. So, no I don’t think this is the right direction we should be headed. It’s just too costly and we’re trying to solve an issue that is just too complex at the moment. I’m for educating the youth and maybe they’ll come up with the technology and solution as a result.

Also, anyone can't just rule the world just like anyone can't be a doctor without any knowledge or skill. Let me tell you this, age doesn't represent someone's capability, knowledge, experience, or skill. Age is just a number, I can be 21 and you can be 60 and I could have more experience, knowledge, skill, or capability than you. What matters is what you have done throughout your lifetime, what you have experienced, and what you've learned including those from the consequences for the choice you've made. These things shape you to become who you are today and it showed weather or not you are capable of doing something.

You think again & tell if millions of people lost jobs & you somehow retained your job... Then will you donate 60% of your salary to the jobless so that they can get food? If you think we can completely stop relying on fossil fuels just in a decade, then you're naive. It's impossible. Solar & wind energy are not reliable & the cost incurred in the making of such equipments to harness energy is very expensive. The energy output is not high also.

When the green new deal specifies on white privillage it also fails to bring up how asian americans and indian americans have more average annual wages it just specifies taking down the white privilege and helping people of color (blacks/hispanics)	UCu05k4IWEJI2NHnq7Cfynng	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu05k4IWEJI2NHnq7Cfynng	0

On mercury we can have a couple of solar panels, miners, refiners, and rail-gun Dyson swarm (instead of a sphere, we could have individual satellites that beam energy to collecting stations with their own orbit) launchers! After the first collector (Dyson swarm satellite) is made we can use that energy to power miner replicators, refiner replicators, rail-gun replicators, and replicator bot replicators! All work together to build more Dyson swarms exponentially growing and increasing power output and using that power to power more of what I said. Saying each satellite can be built in a week, we could be done in 60 doubling times or 60 weeks (1 becomes 2, 4,8, 16, 32, 64, so on and x is number of weeks)! Surrounding the radius of the sun!

America lead the way with the introduction of television. America was the first nation to put two men onto the moon. America can also renew its energy plan so that it relies on renewables, supported by batteries. Texas got a bit confused by forgetting to weather proof its windmills. It can speak to colder states that have done that already so it's ready for the next bout of extreme weather. Extreme weather is a feature of climate change.

Some places in like New Delhi or Shanghai have air so toxic that it’s a literal health hazard to breath it.

Focusing only on the people’s happiness over the economy will crash the economy and will lead to protests and costly reforms<br /><br />Oh yes did I mention that politicians bend to the people’s will to take advantage of them by making empty promises	UCd_zMrtr7ddg4fKyV_auVFQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd_zMrtr7ddg4fKyV_auVFQ	0

With the Green New Deal, say goodbye to modern medicine &amp; surgery, goodbye easy safe travel, goodbye air conditioning, goodbye metal &amp; machine shops, goodbye space exploration and all related jobs, hello manual farming as the #1 career, hello unrepairable roads, hello manual construction (the Amish will teach us how), goodbye half the world’s population or more... death by cold/heat bcz green energy can’t keep enough people warm in the cold climates, no a/c in current hot places where people aren’t used to the heat (&amp; few people lived in before a/c). The Green New Deal will cause mass migration to places with no real need for heat or air conditioning. Oh, say goodbye to refrigerated food &amp; freezers as a way to preserve food, so hello mold &amp; bugs in your food that you can’t keep in chilled appliances. Also say goodbye to well maintained yards &amp; properties with a few acres or more, unless you can let a dozen people live on it in trade for property maintenance. But then you’ll have to expand your septic system to accommodate the extra residents, so that’ll cost $60,000 but you can’t pay it bcz you lost your job that Green energy can’t support... machine shops, Metal making, pretty much most factories and hospitals can’t run on 100% Green energy or even close. They must be faking the Green New Deal. It means no more airline flights, no more cessnas, no more race cars, no more big ships, trains, or submarines, no more space exploration, and much more dangerous military situations, no more easy safe heat lamps for raising chickens for eggs &amp; meat year round. Hottest part of summer only. Say goodbye to automatic clothes dryers &amp; greenhouse heat on late winter nights or cloudy cold days. Why can’t the GND supporters imagine all the changes in lifestyle they’ll be forced to deal with? It’s not like everyone will be able to survive a lack of fossil fuel use at this point. Our roads, bridges, buildings, heat, cooling, jobs, food supply, medical care.... are now almost completely dependent on fossil fuels. To give them up IS to give up city living &amp; work, to give up all electronics, most international travel, most people giving up living in the southern USA &amp; north where winters are bitter cold, and many other places where people can’t live without fossil fuel use. Alaska. Only a few people with the old native skills, currently living that way, could stay there ok. Say goodbye to year round fresh fruit &amp; vegetables... can’t have without fossil fuel easy transportation. Say goodbye to daily mail delivery. No more big farm tractors &amp; equipment. Once your metal gardening tools break, then what? Glass manufacturing? The GND has got to be a huge hoax.	UCqT_bBUlkUHhlwNfsq3CHUA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqT_bBUlkUHhlwNfsq3CHUA	0

All social media/ mainstream media/ governments are all in on the lie. YouTube shadow banned 1 of my videos that got 4.1k views in 2 weeks because it finally got detected. They are censoring the truth. The green new deal is a small piece to the puzzle. The main problem is the UN's Agenda 21 2030. It's scary and entirely true. If you really are interested in the truth then please take the time to watch my 4th latest video by "Spiro Skouras" and my latest upload. The world will be very very grim by 2030. They want everyone to be dependant on the government and own nothing! Once we are dependant they will subtly depopulate! Hope you check the vids out and share your thoughts, have a nice day Amy!

There are literally entire sections of the Earth we know NOTHING about let alone the actual chemistry going on. There are creatures we can't even fathom existing because the environments are so toxic and what we thought was supposed to be "unlivable". This isn't a Fallout game where the author determines how everything works. This is real life where we have barely any idea how SOME things work. After actually being in the scientific field for years, the only thing I learned was that we know NOTHING. We keep guessing and get slightly better at it but that's it.

Copper, Glass, Aluminum, Concrete which mining/getting is harmful for the earth. Additionally you need a lot pf them as they don&#39;t produce as much energy as nuclear energy which I think is much better.Not with Uranium but with Thorium and Plutonium. If you are wondering what Thorium is you can type in Thorium here on YT and find Sam O&#39;Nella Academys video that really well explains why Thorium is much better.

Because radical liberals have it in their collective brain that the American economy, the greatest ever, can run on wind and solar. They of course are suffering from mass delusions.

The removal of America from the oil and gas industry would increase oil prices due to the concentration of reserves. But it would also decrease prices due to lower demand. In fact, if conventional Keynesian Economics work out oil prices would go *down* by about 5 percent due to the fact that The United States and Canada contribute approximately 23 percent of global oil exports and over 30 percent of global imports.

Son los que contaminaron el mundo y lo esconden de calentamiento global pero en realidad lo que es, es contaminación.

Get these old rich white guys out(I’m white). You ever ask yourself why multi-millionaires and billionaires are “working” for under 200k a year? Is it to serve your best interest(which is what the job is intended for) or their best interest(and that of their legacy)? Our government is setup to allow CEO’s of major oil corporations to become president(a MAJOR conflict of interest). Nothing will change until you replace the incumbents on both sides with a younger more progressive candidate. You don’t have to agree with everything they do but get the long term incumbents out and then replace them with a more suitable candidate.

The “unchecked consumption” of our growing populace was, we were told, placing too great a “burden” on the earth and would wipe humanity out in a massive population crash. Paul Ehrlich’s 1968 bestseller, The Population Bomb, forecast hundreds of millions of deaths per year throughout the 1970s, to be averted, he insisted, only by mass population control “by compulsion if voluntary methods fail.” But instead of global-scale famine and death, the 1970s witnessed an agricultural revolution. Despite a near-doubling of world population, food production continues to grow as technological innovation creates more and more food on each acre of farmland. The United States, which has seen its population grow from 200 to 300 million, is more concerned about rampant obesity than a shortage of food. Or consider the campaign against the insecticide DDT, beginning with Rachel Carson’s 1962 book Silent Spring. The world had been on the brink of eradicating malaria using DDT—but for Carson and her followers, controlling disease-carrying mosquitoes was an arrogant act of “tampering” with nature. Carson pronounced ominously that nature was “capable of striking back in unexpected ways” unless people showed more “humility before [its] vast forces.”34 She asserted, baselessly, that continued DDT use would unleash a cancer epidemic, generating a panicked fear of the pesticide that endures as public opinion to this day. But the scientific case against DDT was, and still is, nonexistent. Almost sixty years have passed since the malaria-spraying campaigns began—with hundreds of millions of people exposed to large concentrations of DDT—yet, according to international health scholar Amir Attaran, the scientific literature “has not even one peer reviewed, independently replicated study linking exposure to DDT with any adverse health outcome.”35 Indeed, in a 1956 study, human volunteers ate DDT every day for over two years with no ill effects then or since. Carson’s book led to such a public outcry that, despite its life-saving benefits and mountains of scientific evidence supporting its continued use, DDT was banned in the United States in 1972. Thanks to environmentalist opposition, DDT was almost completely phased out worldwide. And while there is still zero evidence of a DDT cancer risk, the deaths of over a million people a year from malaria’s resurgence are all too real. Environmentalist doomsday projections repeatedly turn out to be wild exaggerations because they are not rooted in objective scientific facts, but on the cowering fear that “tampering” with nature will unleash metaphysical punishment.

We will always need energy its just a matter of transitioning from old outdated forms of energy. People used to use just wood to heat homes and produce steam for locomotives etc. Used to use horse and other forms of transportation We transitioned out of that because other sources of energy became available this is no different.

Industrialization has led to the DRASTIC UNNATURAL warming of the planet. Climate change isn’t avoidable but its effects can be slowed down and reversed. The US has sent many of their garbage to developing countries for them to take care of it, clearly not taking responsibility of their trash. There are also many polluted bodies of water in the United States, for example: Upper Mississippi River, Lower Missouri River, Big Sunflower River, Okefenokee Swamp, Lower Youghiogheny River. I have been minimizing my use of non-biodegradable packaging, walk if I can manage the distance, and purchasing items from sustainable sources.

Research suggests that when people first hear about an idea through the lens of "political feasibility," they respond with more cynicism than if they had considered "is it a good idea" first, and are less likely to try to figure out what the idea means. This is called "tactical framing," and the GOP knows it well! Vox produced a video on this exact strategy earlier, which in turn inspired this video. Stay focused on the quality of the ideas-- you are not a pundit, you are a citizen. Pundits want you to be nihilistic.

I'd rather have a random 80 year old man deciding my fate then someone like AOC. Largely because she's barely an adult and just quit bartending a few weeks ago. You don't let kids run the house and that's for a reason. People forget that the Aged hold wisdom and we don't even appreciate that anymore. They are our leaders though, and us young people will be as well when we are older.	UCHcDiDkBgZQ6y52zgdjhwPA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHcDiDkBgZQ6y52zgdjhwPA	1	UgwZTn8OasqlggRnE3d4AaABAg	S_AME

We will feel all of it. Our children who werent even born when this decision was made, feel it for their whole life. Our burden to carry not theirs.

You saw the video. You saw the impacts. It takes a lot of courage to be able to do something anything like that, and if you do you have the anger of the coal miners and gas workers and car manufacturers all against you. So if you think you can do that, sure, go ahead. Start your own party // join an existing one and see how far that gets you. Even if you somehow manage to become the democratic // nominee for president / congress, how well will you do? “Hey millions of American workers who are 1 pay check away from poverty, I want to take away your jobs so I can protect the trees. Vote for me!” You can imagine how well you’ll do. Please think about that before you complain about politicians and how bad they are :/	UCvkIhLn-BeFPeNw4pXRzQHw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvkIhLn-BeFPeNw4pXRzQHw	1	UgwZTn8OasqlggRnE3d4AaABAg	S_AME

My initial comment was a simple statement of fact, and an honest question. If anything, using the excuse of avoiding an "immature" rhetorical device like sarcasm in order to avoid self reflection is itself very immature. Sarcasm has a rich history of use by statesmen and philosophers, even in extremely formal settings. While it is your right to limit yourself in any way you see fit, you may wish to make yourself a bit more flexible. You've laid out your position and I've laid out mine. There shouldn't be any reason to reply unless you are interested in seriously engaging with my question - unless you are emotionally invested in having the last word, or something equally petty. What shall it be? Will you evade self-contemplation and discussion of your beliefs with the excuse that it is too "immature" for you? Or will you engage an honest question honestly and see where it leads?	UCa6cUsBlECJaqMsd1sS4ZlQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa6cUsBlECJaqMsd1sS4ZlQ	1	UgwZTn8OasqlggRnE3d4AaABAg	S_AME

Also don't you think that all these big tech companies founded by younger people have mentors who are older people? If you look at the young ceos of companies that were founded by people in their 20s, you'll see that they didn't do it alone. There was probably a much older person involved in the process of starting and even running the company. As for whether it's all politicians or a select few, I think it's all?

Sure, they're the one who has more experience. But what did they do with those experiences? Do they use it to guide the younger generation to encounter new problems that emerge? Certainly not. They only use it to benefit themselves. They reject new ideas and solutions because they know, they would be dying soon anyway. And when those crises arise, just leave the problem to the younger generation when they're already doomed by their ignorance and apathy. And would their experience be useful anyway? especially in this new problem that they neglect.

Point is, old-aged politicians don't have the motivation to take care of the environment anymore because most of them must be thinking that they could be dying soon anyway which is the mindset that could be avoided if the deciding bodies are younger and have so much years to live for.

Ugy7NHSJHFASLKCE81h4AaABAg	0	0	2020-06-17 05:40:28	Audio Pervert	The dominant discourse of the mainstream environmental movement is about the preservation of our lifestyles by adopting new &#39;green&#39; technologies. That principle tenet is placed above everything else that the mainstream environmental agencies may claim or actually do. Preserving the very culture and lifestyle which is killing the planet. The crux of the environmental movement today, which is western (and predominantly white) is about the continuation of capitalism and exploitation (i.e using the planet to feed human greed - not addressing the actual needs). Leading environmental organisations, along with scores of scientists and environmental activists actually view the Earth as a resource and not as a living entity. During the last 30 years, the environmental movement has been gradually botched and hijacked by neoliberalism and big-money, manifesting via many new eco-friendly mantras, new technologies and the green new &#39;deal&#39;.

My dad was almost deported because he dropped me off at school when I was younger and pulled over for 5 seconds infront of it. Keep in mind everyone did this every morning and there was 5 others doing the same at the time of the arrest. After a harsh trial he was allowed a work permit making him legal. He does not get anything citizens are allowed. He can only work. Every year it has to be regranted and the process takes about 3 months for everything to be done regardless of what they tell you. If they wanted to they could take it away without an issue over a parking ticket. You can't take away citizenship.

Sure, we're still going to let some hurt people and not try to stomp them out, but we'll stop a large majority? Would you call that good governing, deciding who gets to keep drugs on arbitrary rules? If you strive for 0, you knowledge you might not get there, but if you let one go, you know you have failed your mission. You will probably never reach zero, as we will never achieve 0 drugs most likely, but by cracking down on them, we have severely lowered the numbers.

Of course, we need to be conscious about taking care of the planet, but &quot;good intentions&quot; are not equal to an ACTIONABLE PLAN.<br />In order to be a plan (a real actionable plan), it has to include the &quot;how to&#39;s&quot;, not only the &quot;what&#39;s&quot;.<br />That document (I just downloaded it) is not even a &quot;first step&quot; for such a huge process. You cannot even plan a wedding with such a simple-generic-vague document.<br />They&#39;re &quot;solution&quot; to these problems is just a political promise. They say that if they win in 2020 they&#39;re gonna execute &quot;a plan&quot;, but they say nothing about such a plan.<br />&quot;Wedding plan&quot;: We need to enjoy our wedding. We&#39;ll have a good celebration. We&#39;ll work with people to make things wonderful... etc. <br />Ok, sounds good, but how? What&#39;s the first concrete actionable step? <br />Just saying.

There are too many stakeholders in this and you cannot think about everyone. Sacrifices have to be made. It will be better if we can all share the sacrifice.

We&#39;re never going to completely get rid of fossil fuels, and no one who actually understands the science thinks we need to this quickly. All this deal can lead to is an oppressive government forcing you to buy a more expensive car and not eat the food you want. The deal also thinks we shouldn&#39;t use nuclear energy, even though it&#39;s the most reliable and exo friendly option we have. This is a socialist daydream.

The world will ultimately find alternative sources of energy, more efficient pathways to producing food and better ways to alleviate poverty (one that does not require the theft of earnings and accumulated wealth, without forced labor or authoritarian laws). Based on historical evidence, there is no better method of achieving these goals than the incentive that lays within the free market economy. This policy proposal is in fact very similar to the Chinese Great Leap Forward, the Soviet Unions Bolshevik revolution all the way down to the labor camps (federal jobs guarantee).

Also China puts out 2 times the amount of co2 America does, China will never pass a law to limit their co2. Sounds nice right?

The Billionaire owner of the Wood Group has proposed a plan for preserving part of Aberdeen&#39;s Natural gas industry. Firstly their plan is to increase the city&#39;s offshore wind production. Then the natural gas will be extracted in the same way before having the carbon removed from it. The excess carbon would then be pumped back into the seabed where the natural gas originally came from. Meaning all that&#39;s left is hydrogen. Other cities should adopt this proposal as it allows them to use their assets and skills to their advantage. Otherwise cities reliant on the fossil fuel industry, such as Aberdeen, would be decimated by a transition away from the fuels of the past.

Pollution caused extreme weather, agriculture losing money and cant feed ppl, pollution too causing ppl sick which u need to pay healthcare and on that climate change u realize burning rainforest/flood/extreme heat coz ppl to lose home and family. Basically this plan is to attack 1 issue while in transitioning suggest on solution to keep ppl in their jobs, revise their better healthcare plan.. Guess who will lose in this plan? Oil, Gas, automobile related industries.. that y they fight so hard x to pass this deal.	UCwjaHECP-sV4iC-si7tLMVw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwjaHECP-sV4iC-si7tLMVw	0

An ill-conceived, top-down authoritarian approach to attempt to tackle greenhouse gas emissions that ultimately ends up with obscene waste, impenetrable stifling bureaucracy, innumerable unintended consequences and ultimate failure - even if &quot;successful&quot;.<br /><br />We spend ourselves to oblivion just to drive down the price of fossil fuel commodities for the rest of the world and make a negligible dent in any warming trend. I can only imagine what sort of inoperable Frankenstein a smart grid would be, attempting to balance load and supply, integrating current from thousands if not millions of separate sources, flowing in different directions. And then it will still probably need to be able to be backed up by gas.<br /><br />What a monstrosity. The money would almost certainly be better spent adapting to a warmer future, as unpopular of an opinion as that is.

This stuff has all been said for decades. I know people don&#39;t want to hear this, but it actually matters how much it will cost and DETAILS MATTER. Just saying &quot;we&#39;ll make sure everyone has a job&quot; means nothing -- are we sure these new industries will be able to supplement the jobs lost in older industries? How much will it cost to retrofit buildings, transition our transportation systems to zero emissions, shrink our farming to a local scale? Will people be able to afford the inevitable increased cost of local farmed goods? Will transportation be affordable (new innovations are always exponentially more expensive when they&#39;re first developed)? Will the government be able to subsidize these short comings? These are real questions that we never answer. We throw out these good ideas, but never provide a detailed plan to get it done. Not to mention, we always make the extreme case and fail to recognize there&#39;s got to be a gradual transition. This is literal reason why people on the right blow it off all the time.

Along the plastic in your bottles, buckets, drinking glasses, insulated cups, foam cushions, electrical circuit boards, plumbing pipes, sidings and panels, toys, the plastics that make your car work, Nylon, polyester, acrylic, lycra, spandex, stents, modern eye glasses, medical supplies, etc. All those products contain plastic and plastic comes from oil, gas, and coal. You stop the production of those three items, you stop production on EVERYTHING YOU OWN AND THEN SOME	UCYNYF0x5yXrGbVyXuu3JYMA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYNYF0x5yXrGbVyXuu3JYMA	0

In it, they say they want to upgrade EVERY building in the United States and build plenty of new ones. How will that be paid for? Obviously it all sounds great, but it would literally be impossible to do and if you did do it the economy would collapse entirely. But that probably wouldn&#39;t be a bad thing for the left, it would be easier to begin socialism that way.	UC33QkovKwEw3XcSSro2f3IQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC33QkovKwEw3XcSSro2f3IQ	0

That principle tenet is placed above everything else that the mainstream environmental agencies may claim or actually do. Preserving the very culture and lifestyle which is killing the planet. The crux of the environmental movement today, which is western (and predominantly white) is about the continuation of capitalism and exploitation (i.e using the planet to feed human greed - not addressing the actual needs). Leading environmental organisations, along with scores of scientists and environmental activists actually view the Earth as a resource and not as a living entity. During the last 30 years, the environmental movement has been gradually botched and hijacked by neoliberalism and big-money, manifesting via many new eco-friendly mantras, new technologies and the green new 'deal'. What deal can we as a species make with mother nature?	UChiiv3OpL09LEtZOQ5LkGmw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UChiiv3OpL09LEtZOQ5LkGmw	1	Ugwdf1gpDX3cuecH2z14AaABAg	Cruella De Vil

They are suppose to have people (probably prisoners tbh) to clear out those forest in case of wildfires. But the money they received for that was embezzled by government officials or used somewhere else. And guess what happened.

Ugx3xZnVrMprxiYnl-94AaABAg	1	2	2020-03-15 23:49:25	Jacob Serrano	The Green New Deal isn&#39;t one law or policy - it&#39;s an idea, and an era, which would be embodied by an entire series of laws and policies. This is the same way that the original New Deal wasn&#39;t merely one Act of Congress, but many policies - one of which included Social Security. We need to do this.

Ugx3xZnVrMprxiYnl-94AaABAg.96F-NdS_Dh-974LmfnuOQX		0	2020-04-05 17:04:57	Brian	Jacob Serrano Ok so what are the forthcoming energy policies that would be included in the Green New Deal? Is there anything with specificity that makes scientific and mathematical sense and would be possible to implement within our existing energy framework. 1. The 10 year timeframe for completion is not supported by any published scientific study on energy transitions to date. 2. If we look at Sanders GND version which illustrated one potential path for new policy we see massive changes in the energy sector including 100% ownership of all renewable generating assets solely by PMAs, TVA and Bureau of Reclamation. That is an extremely bizarre policy. Bureau of Reclamation currently does not own any generating assets. PMAs currently do not own anything besides hydroelectric power. TVA primarily owns fossil fuels and hydropower. Why on earth are we giving sole ownership of renewable generation to government agencies that have little to no experience owning solar and wind technologies nor are they designed to own these technologies? Another major head scratcher comes from another policy decision to create a new PMA to cover the remaining 17 states and develop a wholesale electricity market as well as take full ownership of transmission infrastructure. First of all only 3 of the 4 existing PMAs own any transmission infrastructure. SEPA does not own, build or manage transmission (Bernie didn’t do his homework). Second of all there already exists a wholesale electricity market for the 17 states not covered by a PMA. Instead of using a PMA, the market is controlled by regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs) and Independent System Operators (ISOs). RTOs and ISO are the major regional authorities for managing the US Electrical Grid and shared North American Electrical Grid. These institutions are federally charged from FERC - Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which completely outranks PMAs for grid management. Making PMAs takeover this market not only would cause confusion for the Eastern Interconnection, but the existing market operates in Canada, which PMAs do not have legal authority to control, but RTOs and ISOs do. So I’m quite confused what useful purpose this more specific policy would have actually contributed.... In my opinion it looks as though the Sanders team made a bunch of policies without consulting with anyone in the energy industry about the existing regulatory and federal management structure of generation and distribution of energy in this country. That does not inspire confidence in the Democratic Party.	UCPhElDls_CdDcKtnsKMgqoA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPhElDls_CdDcKtnsKMgqoA	1	Ugx3xZnVrMprxiYnl-94AaABAg	Jacob Serrano

It all cones down to what matters now and right now the economy is hurting.

Most people arent rejecting it bc it fights climate change. Most people are rejecting it bc it acts as a trojan horse for other economic/social policies. This is why it has the &quot;new deal&quot; portion in the name. They admit themselves it isnt just about the environment.

From nothing, we built up settlements, which grew to towns, and the towns grew into cities, forming self sustaining colonies. We rebelled and won against one of the most powerful militaries in the world and created a new government which up to then has never been tried before. We moved west, crossing mountains into more untamed land, settling everywhere from coast to coast. We built railroads connecting both coasts, cutting through mountains and rivers and all other natural obstacles. We built our own canals connecting rivers throughout the continent, then built one through Panama connecting the two largest oceans. We built up the interstates connecting major cities. We sent people to space, then to the moon and return home to tell the tale. <br /> <br />People knew this would be difficult and expensive, but did that stop them? Now the world is threatened by increasing temperatures, and a solution is being proposed, people are saying &quot;it&#39;s too expensive&quot; and that &quot;it can&#39;t be done&quot;.

People buy so much into this that they willingly destroy their own joy, kindness, love and even forget about what nature is here for in order to step into this depressed organised-by-government-mayan-calendar-brutally-needing-action, which consequences will be more devastating than the change of climate itself. By doing so, people let their energies being drained by some who understand how they work and use them for their benefits. You need to be energetically sovereign if you want to respect nature and the planet, because the vibration of this independence is close to that of the planet, and you will need this to survive the years to come, instead of being directed to lower vibrations of doom : this is a personal choice, it is up to each of you guys, to buy into the doom, or to revive your personal energies and share with others... all is up to you, not your government !

I agree that lithium is a problem but I'm no scientist and there may be alternatives. You know what IS a pipe dream? The idea that taking no action to stop climate change is going to help. My own world may not be habitable to me in as little as 12, 15 years. I understand you may not care, but I do. I want a planet to live on that isn't completely destroyed by our own hubris.

For us to all magically switch to electric cars, the government is going to have to buy or somehow encourage people to buy new cars. That is not going to happen 100%, and will greatly hinder the economy. I am a minor, so I look at it through a lens that affects me most. Middle-or low income families will not have more than 1 car, which will mean that minors no longer be able to drive to get a job. I believe (I don't know if this is fact) that a large part of fast food jobs or basic laborers are minors. Not all of them, but a big enough chunk that removing them will drop their effectiveness, dropping their use. It also means more student loan because both families and the students don't have as much money saved up for college, hurting them later in life. Another issue is one many aren't thinking about. I work in heating and cooling. My boss, who is an old man, has told me stories about changes being made, and I'm witnessing some of them. In order to cool and heat us, we use refrigerants. Almost all of the older units will use a refrigerant known as R-22. It's the most efficient version that you could get on the market a few years ago. It's has been taxed so much that it is now $100 USD per pound of the stuff. You normally put around 2.5 pounds at least to use it, if it's just a leak. The replacement for it, R-410A is half as efficient as R-22. That means your electric bill goes up, and so does your heat. I know that either substance are not good for the environment, R-22 being worse, but where will we accept that this is the best that we can do? And before you ask, no, I'm no expert. I'm a minor, blessed to have a high-school job in this industry.	UCJfgV-9wpaMMoOO5DB_l0dw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJfgV-9wpaMMoOO5DB_l0dw	1	UgxVg7Nu4cNkP3puruZ4AaABAg	Blue

The capital outlays of the GND is irrelevant to the choice, as it is easily amortized. The cost of green energy is pretty much equal to carbon. Between plug hybrids/EV etc, there is no life style impact to Americans and likely positive economic benefits.	UCBrHfEsd5bNdrp2Y6n7ZJKg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBrHfEsd5bNdrp2Y6n7ZJKg	0

Ugy_KDrUJaOm4o1q0Bh4AaABAg	0	0	2020-02-27 11:40:46	Amones-Ray	Overstressing the environment in this way was inevitable. Tell me if this story sounds familiar:<br />A new technological advancement comes around and puts thousands of people out of their jobs because now what used to take 5 people to do takes only 1. But somehow after a while unemployment goes back down to where it used to be, ergo the economoy&#39;s total output must have increased. Rinse and repeat. Forever.<br /><br /><br />We&#39;re about to hit the CO2 threshold and even if we don&#39;t, we&#39;ll someday hit some other threshold because there are literally infinite ways in which to overstress the environment. And as long as the aforementioned cycle doesn&#39;t stop, we&#39;re bound to overstep one of them sooner or later.<br /><br /><br />The solution is to illegalize the asymetrical employer-employee relationship, leaving the cooperative as the only way to work collectively. Then when a new technoloical advancement comes along to any business, it&#39;s no longer vastly increased profits for the employer and the boot for some employees, but instead reduced work hours for everyone with the same pay as before. As a sidenote, this economy will slowly approach the utopian idea of nobody having to work, whereas capitalism basically defines the amount of work you&#39;re supposed to be doing as constant and ramps up the total economic output to offset any technological advances interfering with that amount.

I hear this complaint a lot from older people who simply dont seem to understand the scale of the advancement of science in the past few decades. They were wrong back then, partly because of a lack of understanding of climate science, and partly because back then neither china nor india had yet become a global superpower, and thus hadn't yet vastly increased the damage being done to the earth.

But I am beginning to see this is a real problem that the political right really isn&#39;t addressing. I still do not agree with much of the left&#39;s proposed solutions to this problem (as highlighted in this video), but the more I think about it, the more I realize that a conservative approach is possible. If only all political parties would begin working together on this, I am hopeful we could see some real solutions take place.

It's perhaps an element of it, rather than market-based in nature, but having some such policies does not make a nation purely socialist. That would require complete command and control of all resources by the state; which, thankfully, we don't have (although any step in that directioncould be called a more "socialist" policy).

Like i said, bernie lost the battle but because of his influence, he may not lose the war. this is exactly what ive been talking about. that split in the dems between traditional capitalist progressiveness and liberal socialism, the green new deal if anything is the admission of a truce between those two ideologies. and the right is just as responsible honestly for desperately supporting such a controversial and corrupt figure. you guys gave more legitimacy and support towards the dems by supporting divisive politics for years. this is how radicalism gets started.

I encourage you to do your research, as I will submit to you that it is actually government policies like the fed subsidizing the coal industry that are at the root of the problem - and if you think that is the fault of the free market, you do not understand what the free market is. (also see my previous comments) I will remind you our economy is a mixed one, and I will submit to you it is always more "command and control," not more freedom, that makes it worse. As pointed out, the U.S. has both one of the freest economies and healthiest ecosystems - we have also led the world in reducing carbon emissions as of late. If the government stopped funding alternative energy like windmills and solar panels that don't work as well, we might start seeing a shift towards nuclear power, which I believe is probably the best thing we can do.

China is the largest producer of CO2 ( almost twice that of the US) and according to the Paris Agreement, they do not have to do much in comparison to the US. So, even if the US do not emit any greenhouse gas, if China and India (they contribute almost half of the emission of the world) does not do much and decrease their output by a significant amount, nothing matters. Also, in this green new deal, the alternative they proposed for oil and natural gas is not feasible since they do not want any nuclear, which is actually a source of energy with zero carbon emissions and it is more efficient and cheaper than anything else. As this proposed deal is not feasible and is not applicable in this reality, and they tried to achieve this dream which includes renovating all buildings, automobiles, energy grid, etc. into zero emission version in just 10 years, this deal is just a sham. And as the world keeps developing, there will be more emissions in the future. And as these politicians do not push for a viable alternative like nuclear as a source of energy, this deal is just a method used by politicians to make the general public scared and a way for them to scam the people of their money. Example, politicians that have been crying about the increase in sea level kept buying beach front property, uses private jets, etc. And the predictions made by politicians in the past decades did not actually happen.

Certainly the cost of *not* doing something now may be greater than people realize. I'm still not convinced that the GND is truly free market-oriented (maybe in some details), but again, I definitely think there are ways to go about bringing on the rapid change necessary to address carbon emissions and yet do it in a bipartisan an economically favorable manner. For instance, I think the government should stop subsidizing the coal industry, and nuclear power should be more widely used (and as a side note, the U.S. was in fact one of the most successful Nations at reducing CO2 emissions in the world in 2019).

Most of the document talks about non-environmental social issues. The entire Green New Deal goes into no detail whatsoever on how we would implement any of its solutions, their cost, or even the actual impact on the environment. It's a wish list with no substance, a "plan" devised by people who have no plan but want to seem like they do. Most people will never read the Green New Deal, but they'll see the catchy title and they'll hear about how we have 12 years before our environment is destroyed.

I personally think they need to fund the switch to alternative fuels and new age processes of making food and energy in a green method . Not the Tax Payers .. Since the Tax payers do not Profit from the Corporations Directly. It&#39;s the same as having the poor pay to put up a Super Bowl Stadium , and not be able to pay for a seat at the game . Government and Corporations have been putting that over on the Working Poor for long enough . The Oil Companies can afford to start an alternative fuel Company as a transition and switch into a Green Fuel Mega Business all on it&#39;s own , with put tax payers funding it .

Everyone suggesting nuclear power I hope you&#39;re joking.. The whole thing about NUCLEAR is because it splits the nucleus of an atom, releasing energy. Which is good BUT it leaves radioactively charged isotopes and creates nuclear waste that is harmful. Not to mention it takes tens of thousands of years for it to break down. and a BIG factor, you ever had radiation burns/poisoning? Doesn&#39;t seem like any fun.

Ugw2tmC0sJEdodZyhix4AaABAg	1	1	2020-02-11 17:44:20	Katherine Totnes	The green new deal is a tax on everything we do make wear eat drink drive import export and even breathe. The main goal is to eliminate cars (as electric ones are neither green nor workable) to be replaced with bikes walking and light rail trains. The next step will be to put a ban on the sale of new combustion engines by a specific date and then limiting the number of new vehicles to be sold. Bans on commercial trucks and shipping will follow. Then they will turn to aeroplanes, reducing their use. Always higher and higher taxes will be used to get the public to &quot;voluntarily&quot; reduce their use of personal transportation services. Thats how it works, slowly and steadily towards the goal. Single family homes are a target for elimination to be replaced by high rise stack and pack apartments in the name of reducing energy use. That will include curfews on carbon heating systems mandating they be turned off during certain hours. Heating oil devices and wood burners will become illegal Gradually energy use of any kind will be continually reduced. The green new deal calls for government control of every single home office and factory to tear down or retrofit them to comply with massive environmental energy regulations. The beef industry is a direct target for elimination. It will start with mandatory decreases in meat consumption until it disapears from our daily diet. The consumption of dairy will follow. Since the revelation of the green new deal the national debate is now over cattle emissions of methane and the drive to eliminate them from the planet. Controlling what we eat is a major part of the green new deal. &quot;Zero economic growth&quot; The green new deal calls for a massive welfare plan where no one worldwide earns more than anyone else. So where will jobs come from after we have banned most manufacturing, shut down most stores, stopped single family home construction, closed the airline industry and severely regulated farms and the entire food industry? This is their answer to the hated free markets and individual choice. The green new deal will destroy the very concept of out Constitutional Republic, eliminating private property and locally elected represenative government, free markets and individual freedoms. All decisions in our lives will be made for us by the government - just to protect the environment of course. How well that scheme works to keep the masses under control!

You clearly haven't been to Northern Europe where electric cars are the vast majority of car sales in nordic countries. Yes, production of electric cars is worse environmentally speaking than traditional vehicles but this can be greatly reduced if China adopted better production practices. Plus, the lifetime use of a gasoline car far exceeds any and all environmental impacts from electric cars, even if all the electricity comes from non-renewables. The problem is the batteries and how to dispose of them safely at the end.

The immigrant workers that she says will come to the US in order to help work on the project will likely be unskilled. Furthermore, after all the work is completed the workers will have no work to do, and, consequently, the US will be left with thousands of unpaid workers who will try obtaining other menial jobs, leaving less for Americans. The idea of shutting down automobile companies that manufacture cars that run on gas or diesel to make way for electric-car makers will cause thousands of jobs to be lost, not to mention that many stockholders will be affected financially. The same also applies to the many Americans who work on the oil field and other places involving natural gases. The GND won't promote business productivity. The wealthy, with a 90% tax rate, would be taxed to death. Instead of pouring that money back into the business, which will help support jobs, they will be trying to cut much of their expenses out, something that will cause jobs to be lost. And lastly, it is just not feasible. Money does not grow off of tree. The USA has limited resources, and a lot of debt as it is. If the money of the wealth of the richest Americans were taken from them and used to help stimulate the GND efforts, it would only amount to 35 trillion dollars. Also the idea of renovating every home in America to make it environmentally friendly is impossible. No amount of workers can make adjustments to 120 million buildings (if my number is wrong, this does make my argument nullified. Even ten million buildings is unfeasible) within the timeframe of ten years.	UC_v_tnWlBVgmau2DdiE-y5g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_v_tnWlBVgmau2DdiE-y5g	1	UgzMxUTsYrcRlFp5qqJ4AaABAg	Lego Brawls!

They are so compromised by so many factors that it sadly eliminates any of their input because of their conflicts of interest. Why is no one admitting they can&#39;t ignore the elephant in the debate? Having so called experts in the field suing for slander, anyone who dares question their work, is a clear clue that big money is at stake here. Silencing critics with very expensive law suits has to be supported by big money. Follow the money, it usually gives you a very good indicator of motivation and credibility.

So if we go &quot;zero emissions&quot; that means no more of ANYTHING that is not built/manufactured in America.

Geological records prove this. Every nation on our planet could go back to the stone age and stop using fossil fuels and the earth will continue to warm up and water levels will continue to rise until a certain point is reached and then it will go back to cooling down. <br /><br />No matter what we do Alaska will once again be tropical and Florida will go under water. Then it will slowly go back to the way it is now and proceed to get colder. The water levels will drop and the ice caps will get bigger. When it reaches a certain point it will proceed to warm up again. <br /><br />This is the natural cycle of our planet. But if you really want to you can scare yourself and your kids to death thinking the world will end in 8-10 years. If you don&#39;t like this planet your welcome to help humanity go to Mars. Otherwise stop your silliness.	UCi6WNwelwV5G9dzX_nZBAOA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi6WNwelwV5G9dzX_nZBAOA	0

And his predictions did not come true. The past and current models are wrong, but too many people have been programmed for decades to be scared about Global Warming. Yes the climate does change, but the topic has been politicized and they don&#39;t teach schoolchildren anything else but C02 is bad...you don&#39;t hear teachers or professors talk about methane or water vapor or ozone and their effects. C02 is miniscule! C02 is plant food! The real problem is destroying habitat and toxic chemicals, not C02. Wake up.	UCurWQxNyfoaDYHY5J8_9lQw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCurWQxNyfoaDYHY5J8_9lQw	0

This change would be extremely unreasonable. It would be so expensive. It means that we all would be paying hundreds of times higher taxes. Plus, wind energy only works when the wind blows, and solar energy only works when the sun is out.

Nuclear energy won't last forever because there is a limited supply of the radioactive rods they use to generate the energy from. I also think you'd have to be pretty brain dead to think any type of infrastructure will last forever so of course that isn't what I meant LOL When people say sustainable energy lasts forever they obviously mean the SOURCE (solar radiation, wind power, heat from geothermal etc...). Hate to toot my own horn but I'm literally a college senior majoring in environmental science so trust me I know no infrastructure stays pristine forever.

What's your definition of forever? My guess 25 years, as that's about the max extended life for a solar panel which after say 15 years has lost about 20% of its productive capacity. Similar for wind turbines. See everything you think lasts forever is a source, like the sun. Electricity is NOT a source it is a product of a transformation process and that process requires machines with finite life expectancies which will require either recycling, disposal or both.

Nuclear will eventually win out when all the money thrown at the current alternatives underpinning the Green New Deal begin to self destruct. Also, current fission reactor technology produces quite a bit of "spent" fuel which must be dealt with. Hopes rely on fusion technology, which remains a stretch at this time.

Nuclear Waste it sits either onsite at the plant since the bunkers we used to use are all full, not to mention they are crumbling because they were built more than half a century ago... We produce around 2,000 metric tons of Nuclear waste a year (2204 lbs per Metric ton) and thats only with about 1/5 of our electricity (not counting the other sources of energy we would need to replace largest being automobiles.) SO that would mean if we use nuclear energy JUST for our electrical needs we would be producing more than 10,000 metric tons of nuclear waste a year or roughly 22,040,000 pounds of it per year, nuclear plants would become over run with nuclear waste exceptionally fast. The Waste issue is truly the largest issue I see with Nuclear energy as there is NOTHING we can do with it, we have no way of recycling it, the only thing we can do with it at this time is store it and when we use it on such a level storage becomes a severe issue. That then still leaves Automobiles no one will drive a nuclear car around thats definitely not safe in any way shape or form, if we switched to electric cars and instead just used those we then increase our needs on the electrical grid (further worsening the issue I stated just before this and increasing the amount of waste produced exponentially.) Then there is the question of our commercial airplane industry, would we also power these through electricity? if so that would only further the first issue. How about how we build our buildings? will that too also be changed to the electric grid? if so that again just amplifies the first issue I brought up... The Green new Deal is about sustainability and Nuclear Energy IS NOT sustainable... I will admit it is far more sustainable than our current sources of energy however.

We already have tens of nuclear reactors across the country, and nuclear uprating would be the best solution, as by essentially "upgrading" existing nuclear reactors, we would make them more effecient for commercial use as well as safer to avoid any NIMBY protests and any concerns of the next Chernobyl.

According to a 2010 study, we would need to increase the number of nuclear power stations by 10% every year from 2010 to 2050. The simple math: 1 new power station every 2 weeks for the next 40 years. Now probably 50 years, because we haven't done anything in 10 years. And... most of the energy generation created would be cannibalized by the production of the other nuclear power stations, because efficiency has almost maxed out. Want links to the original report? Say the word. I've read a lot of studies on this. But people want a "solution" which means: they want something magical so that they don't have to give up anything about their lifestyle. But as always, nuclear, thorium, fusion, algae fuels, hydrogen cells... there's always some magical innovation people have seen on a TED Talk and they think they're suddenly an expert.

If we replaced all oil and gas and covered the worlds needs solely with nuclear energy, uranium would last 4-8 years. We need renewable energy that can not run out. Building one nuclear power plant takes roughly 30 years and costs billions of dollars. If you build hundreds or thousands more to cover the energy needs there would very likely be more nuclear disasters. There would absolutely be more nuclear waste with a half time of 10.000 years. While we should not shut down current nuclear sites, we can not rely on it for our future.

Secondly, you forget that people, even wealthy and educated, tend to believe that things are not as bad as scientists say... why? Because it’s easier to be in denial, specially when you reaping huge profits in the current system.

When we start seeing the effects of climate change the results will be too late and so the market is unable to react quickly enough to this. This is still capitalism it's just regulated capitalism wich is what has worked best in the west. Free markets are great but they have their flows, and we should never stop improving the system to a system that suits us	UC6w_8hzdes0M3fQrKB43_3w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6w_8hzdes0M3fQrKB43_3w	1	Ugz0VU3T-eMmZpC43CB4AaABAg	Jim Bowden

Second, everytime someone has a solution it coincidentally brings about the socialist utopia! Every major solution posted by the so called top "experts" is socialist. I'm not arguing that climate change doesn't exist what I'm saying is that if it's a man made problem it can have a man made solution that doesn't involve socialism. Capitalism made the West the most powerful and wealthy culture in human history. If things were actually really bad, and hurting people, it would be economical for businesses to start being eco-friendly. So don't buy into the scare mongering and trust the people who have money. Why do that you say? Because they won't do anything that risks their wealth, and if climate change really was the issue those people say it is, rich people would be working to stop it. We need to work to keep a clean Earth, but at the same time we need to be smart and realistic.

Nuclear energy could replace nearly all of our energy needs (minus things like cares and planes) incredibly quickly with people feeling effectively no change to their daily lives. Within a few years we could have an entire nuclear energy network and 99% of people wouldn't even notice other than their electric bill went down. The main problem is that Chernobyl happened, and now everyone is scared of nuclear energy. People also hear the words nuclear waste and have no idea what it means or what we can do about it. The solution still isn't entirely sustainable for forever, we'd need to implement it with a mind to change to renewable resources as the technology gets better over the next few hundred years. But it would give us a few more hundred years when as of now, we don't have anywhere even close to that kind of time to become carbon free.

Imagine telling your grand kids. "Oh we couldn't save the world cause it cost too much" Or "Our government hates that country so we didn't adopt its ways to save the planet, which i agree too" Nice!

Part 8 is &quot;guaranteeing a job with a family-sustaining wage, adequate family and medical leave, paid vacations, and retirement security to all people of the United States&quot;. What&#39;s a family sustaining wage these days? It would have to be at least $50K/yr probably. If the government provides wages like that on demand with no skills or education then how could McD ever find people to flip burgers? Nobody would work for minimum wage ever again, unless they&#39;re illegal aliens. No nation with a universal jobs guarantee pays more than minimum wage, for that very reason. It&#39;s supposed to be a backup until you can find a real job in the private sector, not a career choice. Part 15 of the same resolution is even more ambitious; &quot;providing all people of the United States with—<br />(i) high-quality health care;<br />(ii) affordable, safe, and adequate housing;<br />(iii) economic security; and<br />(iv) access to clean water, clean air, healthy and affordable food, and <br />nature.&quot;<br /><br />The first and last ones may be practical to actually carry out, but not the middle two. See, their ploy is to sneak a few outrageous things in with a bunch of reasonable sounding things so nobody will notice them. It&#39;s like an omnibus bill.

UgxH_ok0ZbZgRb6DwdN4AaABAg	0	1	2019-12-28 00:51:39	lenno 15697	The big problem for centre-right folk is that one, they want a economically efficient way to deal with climate change and two,<br />they don&#39;t want massive increase in taxes that would accompany the increase in the welfare state under the Green New Deal proposal/framework. From a political perspective any attempt to significantly increase the welfare state will be met with opposition from not only every Congressional Republican, but a large amount of Democrats (Blue-Dog Democrats and most of the Establishment).<br /><br /><br />So why not this - A high carbon tax (or alternatively tradable quotas that will be auctioned off, i.e. cap and trade) that significantly raises the price of releasing carbon into the atmosphere, which would force companies to transition to greener energy. And a UBI style rebate that would more than offset the regressive nature of the carbon tax. This proposal would be pareto efficient, revenue neutral, is still pretty progressive overall, and is a fair compromise between what the primary Green New Deal advocates (such as AOC) want and what Congressional Republicans want. It&#39;s basically something similar to the ACES bill advocated by Pelosi in 2009.	UCQNrg43WAcxFTTnMKLnOEPw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQNrg43WAcxFTTnMKLnOEPw	0

Consequently, greenhouse gases and global climate change are of paramount importance to the eco-activist agenda. While much has been written about global climate change over many years, the basic aspects of the issue haven’t changed; we are asked to forget things we once knew and ignore the simplest hypothesis that the earth’s climate is ever changing.

We need a complete change in ethics.. Namely profit must be a secondary goal, promoting a sustainable ecosystem must be the primary goal. Business must be required to prove what they are doing is beneficial to HUMANS, and not detrimental to food, water, air, and human health on all levels. Americas, Australia, Europe, and Russia must align and try to bring China on board.. this is an existential crises whether it be uncontrolled radioactivity, climate disruption, unsustainable extraction of any natural resource, genetic manipulation of food, 5G technology and on and on. . It&#39;s going to be really rough, the loss of population may be extreme.. we should seek to get as many people through the crises as possible.

The tree example was to point out a simpler effective way to reduce co2 emissions. Tesla has developed solar panels and batteries for homes that are being tested on homes in a few places. Look up Tesla battery australia to see trials they've done. It's promising. There's also a 100+ companies researching and developing solid state battery. Competition for new batteries is out there. The gov could add incentives. Governments are good at military research but market competitors are faster in getting products out to people and are already leading the way. It would be nice if governments could help speed up the research and the distribution.

It would cause many people to enter poverty for a result that will likely not have much of an effect on the climate. It would be better for people if the gov grew a few million trees and allowed people to upgrade to electric vehicles in a buyback program.

These scientists are malthusian in their warnings and authoritarian in their prescriptions, arguing that we must sacrifice all economic development for the sake of the planet despite the fact that we contribute less carbon emissions than the developing world. It is only through innovation that the planet can be saved, not through its stifling. We make more technological developments in five years as a modern society today than as in a twenty year period 100 years ago. Surely we can produce solutions to this crisis.

Combine that with his $15 minimum wage and for our economy aggregate supply would decrease as it becomes more expensive to do business. Basically, he would put us into a recession as workers get laid off from jobs as businesses become more expensive to run and cyclical unemployment begins to grow. So even though he may not want to stifle innovation, he stifles innovation by interfering in the market. All that besides, anyone who supports the green new deal wants to send the United States back into the stone age. That is literally what will happen. It would take trillions of dollars to build the new infrastructure to update our grid. We spend 2 trillion dollars a year on social security and medicare/medicaid combined. That is half of our budget. Such a multi trillion dollar plan is completely impossible with our current levels of spending. Bernie Sanders has no viable solutions to any of the problems America faces, he only has a shovel that would deepen those problems.

Think about it, 97% of scientists proven wrong with no other evidence to the contrary. People have tried. People have no other conclusion than that there must be human impact on the environment. Scientists try and underpredict the impact of humans because if they were to overstate it they'd be swiftly proven wrong. And for the naturalist argument that the Earth's climate is changing naturally, *they thought of that.* In fact, the Earth is actually in the process of moving towards an ice age. This and other environmental factors would mean that Earth is actually supposed to be getting cooler.

The issue is 1) to what degree and 2) is there a remedy or not and 3) how to address any portion that is human-caused. Once we can agree on some of the issues we only have to discover where our ideas differ and discuss from there. Simple in theory.

We will fail horribly if we do not transition into this. We can get to 0 emissions, but if we think that it is going to happen overnight with no recoil, we will not succeed. It doesn&#39;t matter if we have goals to help the world when it is so in need of our help if we are stepping over the dead bodies of our population to do it. Look at China&#39;s environmental policy, look how it is failing. We cannot do that to ourselves in the pursuit of even the most altruistic of goals. However, if we transition properly, we can do it!

To build on that, capitalists would use cheap methods of removing the waste: dumping into natural phenomenon such as rivers. Aside from that, there’s also a HUGE amount of risk in building nuclear plants - they produce large amounts of energy, but also require constant supervision and maintenance to ensure that they don’t overheat or otherwise malfunction. If anything goes wrong, then we’ve created an area around a malfunctioned plant of nuclear fallout.

You have to deal with the waste and you have to make sure the waste is safe for a very long time. What happens if in the future , due to climate changes there is some level of social collapse and the waste sites can’t be safe guarded? Then you have a big problem.

We thrive on making things more convenient for our lives, also on making more and more money.... hence inventions and innovations. But what we don&#39;t get is every time we invented something new, we have invented a new set of problems, whether it&#39;s resources or energy or by-products or wastes or destroying the ecosystem/environment. Even with the inventions of new ways to eliminate these problems, a new set of problems will arise within that new inventions. And that is the nature of all human inventions. We can only keep this problem under control by stop inventing new things but also adhere to massive reduction in human population to stop the demands and the wastes of these products that we so accustom to in our daily lives. We are in a vicious cycle and if we don&#39;t stop we will see the end of humankind in a not too distant future.	UCjE7JJ0fJlm-3P3w6Kt1ujw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjE7JJ0fJlm-3P3w6Kt1ujw	0

I would like to see a chart from as far back as possible. Because, in history, climate change has been happening long before fossil fuels. Populations have been exterminated or migrated because of climate change. And I never hear anyone say what part the geoengineering of the sky plays a part. Why is that? I really want to know. And how about the new building techniques that make it possible to live completely off the grid!!! It is real. No water bill, no electric bill, no gas bill. Freedom...but that means we would keep our own money instead of forking it over like the machine is used to. The green new deal just seems like a way to slip in and keep everyone dependent, just on new different methods.	UCd-7Z3cfdQ46nSsqMAfowPA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd-7Z3cfdQ46nSsqMAfowPA	0

India (8%) and China (20%) in combination produce 28% of the world's carbon while having a populations of over a billion people each. The United States has 340 million. Stop deflecting blame to other countries rather than acknowledging that the United States IS a massive producer, especially for our population and can help to set the trend for a clean future.

Underdeveloped countries are steadily growing. So this is the latest strategy to cut short their growth. Close industries and let the people starve by cutting down the economy of countries who were oppressed for their resources for decades. <br />Please don&#39;t underestimate human intelligence. We will go on living. Maybe without the trimmings and trapping of superficial western culture but the purging will benefit society.

If anything we should be preparing our infrastructure for the new climate and increasing coast lines. I&#39;m sorry but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible to change from oil anytime soon maybe 150 years but it&#39;s difficult because oil products are extremely energy rich and most of our infrastructure depends on oil and I don&#39;t mean financially I mean our energy needs are so rooted into oil that it makes invading lands for oil really justified. But if you&#39;d like a more hopeful outlook I think it&#39;s within the realm of possibility to anticipate the disasters and be more prepared than any country and then perhaps afterwards we can revisit trying to find a more long term goal with other major polluting nations. The money isn&#39;t the problem it&#39;s mostly technological limitations that may never be met unless we apply the solution in such a way that would be as saturated as gas stations are common in cities and throughout the United States	UCsafKUq3BABHQmJu-zLbmYw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsafKUq3BABHQmJu-zLbmYw	0

It has been 30 years since Japan experienced actual growth. Post World War II, Japan was not worried about militarism and they had to rebuild their economy after the collateral damage from the atomic bombs and the whole war had. What else would they focus on aside from growing their economy? Japan was a tech and innovation hub until recently. It became expensive, more competition came in. Japan had a rapid, near unheard of growth rate after the war, which was unsustainable. The economy has not moved since the 90s aside from their debt crisis growing. There is nothing worse than just a stagnant, non-moving economy.	UCz2DY50MN0FduRqMglFUMBg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz2DY50MN0FduRqMglFUMBg	1	UgzLsajF8vFS27hcamR4AaABAg	ettajamsy

When you say "socialism", people think of the government seizing control of the means of production and private property. In theory it's suppose to be collective ownership by the people, but it just ends up in a dictatorship. That's why the word makes people nervous - and rightly so. When you say that Denmark and Norway are socialist, you are misrepresenting what actual socialism looks like. Having socialized health care and state funded education is not socialism.

Even with EVs, with government subsidies, it is still only a small fraction of vehicles. Now the Chinese have scrapped the subsidies. I have been reading that sales will drop.

UgyA2pPiQ9py_cVQcQN4AaABAg	0	1	2019-10-18 01:04:01	Kuri	The climate problem is probably the best irl example of a perfect prisoner&#39;s dilemma problem, with three possible scenarios:<br /><br /><br />First scenario: unanimous support and cooperation of the world&#39;s largest energy consumers, that means US, Russia and China will need to agree on a plan, simultaneously reducing their carbon emission. For that plan to work, all parties have to cooperate, and suffer a lot in the process. <br />Yet the whole plan will collapse if anyone decides that &quot;hey, while it&#39;s costing others greatly to transform their economies, why don&#39;t we double down on fossil fuels?&quot;, whoever does that will become the single biggest winner of the next century, everyone else loses. This is the second scenario. The final scenario is everyone being as selfish as possible hoping they&#39;ll be the biggest winner and everyone loses in the end, &quot;loses&quot;, in this case, means the destruction of the human civilisation.<br /><br /><br />Last point to make this spicy: for Russia, global warming and rising sea level are almost all-benefits, and they&#39;ll be the least affected by the global humanitarian disaster, both China and the US know that.<br />Now, guess which of those scenarios will be the most likely one...?

No, we shouldnt switch cause even with the new power source there is no one to power the nation like fossil fuel did. Sure the sun is unlimited and the wind is too but it wont work cause the country would go bankrupt and collapse. When the country collapses then there is no earth day, there no agencies to try to fix these issues. Exxon has a better plan than this and that&#39;s to capture CO2 emission and break it down inside the plant. The world runs on fossil fuel cause it is the most efficient fuel. The US alone uses too much power to use solar and wind and it would take years to switch, there is no possible way to flip to the economic safety they want without causing more issues. This green deal is a flop cause it is unrealistic. Most energy in electric cars is made by fossil fuel and you need more energy than what fossil fuel puts out.

Cows that graze require lots of land, so to increase meat production you have to increase the amount of available land. Which requires you to deforest undeveloped lands which protect biodiversity and act as carbon sinks. The other option is to force the animals to live in cramped conditions where they are fed animal feed produced from corn. Not only is this unhealthy for the cows but they live in deeply unsanitary conditions and their diets did not evolve to digest corn based feed and it does not sit well with them. Their undigested food and waste products contain high quantities of methane which is a far more potent greenhouse gas than CO2. (There are ways of harvesting this manure as a source of energy but that's beside the current point.) Meat production on the scale that we do it in developed countries is deeply flawed and it will only get worse if we continue to expand it for new markets. Until we can find alternative production methods we should decrease our individual meat consumption and try to buy local ethically sourced meats. It won't be easy to completely change but just starting to take days off and reframe your relationship with meat will lead to a healthier climate and a healthier you.

The climate activists claim to be on the side of science but then they don&#39;t want to use science to solve the problem. As for electric vehicles they are already gaining popularity. It&#39;s not long before they become better options then combustion powered cars and people will start buying them.

Something we&#39;ve always avoided made so feasible in this one &quot;Deal&quot; complete and udder government control over our entire economic system. How do so many people ignore the most important part of the deal? I don&#39;t know<br /><br /><br />-Do we think the government will just hand the power back to the people after all of this??? No, they wont. In fact we might not ever get our America back.<br /><br /><br />-Is getting rid of cows truly necessary??? No, its not. What we don&#39;t see is that, this &quot;Deal&quot; just wants its greasy hands all over every part of the economy. (Some parts of this deal seem completely absurd! Their excuse for everything? Climate Change. Yes, I know your response... its a viable excuse. Whats not a viable excuse is the stench of socialism ALL over this document.<br /><br /><br />-I again mention that what they are trying to do in this &quot;second part&quot; could be irreversible. Imagine playing Jenga with a house (A very risky thing, I might say) this deal plans this pull the foundation from right beneath the house. One rule of Jenga I know is to not try taking the three blocks from the bottom. What happens??? Complete and utter collapse. Unlike regular Jenga, Jenga with a house cant just have its foundation slipped back in. It will call for a need of complete destruction of all the house that we all live in. So their plan is to just create another house with an even the rubble of the house beneath it. Not a very &quot;stable&quot; plan is it. This house represents the economy of America which will completely and utterly crumble. Something that can NEVER be undone. <br /><br /><br />NO Amount of money can fix this destruction of our economy. (Sad but true)<br /><br /><br />-My final problem is this. If this is the &quot;First Step&quot;, do we have the Second &amp; Third ready to go??? This plan bestows all of our trust and power given to the government (Which would be a massive mistake on our part) and hope they know what comes next.<br /><br /><br />I feel that if there is something that needs to be done... It must be done in a less extreme fashion that all people of this America and the World could agree on. Read the entire plan yourself (EVERY DETAIL) and get all your worries and questions answered.<br /><br /><br />-A Random Guy hoping for something better.

For instance, electric car battery production? And what about the existing combustion engine vehicles? Maintain the existing 10%, or a mere 15% ethanol fuel, the remainder being petroleum, or have that market share shift away from petroleum predominance, all with existing infrastructure. This &quot;Green&#39;&quot; presentation ignores specifics of any substitution /transition program, and it&#39;s complete neglect of the accelerated battery production carbon spike can make one wonder if they are intentionally trying to jolt Siberia&#39;s methane.

How are farmers supposed to grow crops and harvest them if they don&#39;t have diesel for their tractors? Electric tractors is not a viable option either. Are they supposed to go 3 rows and go back to the house to charge up? Has anyone actually read the green bill. They have not actually suggested any. solutions for going green. They just make claims for what it is going to change. There aren&#39;t any &quot;this is how we substitute the problems&quot; that this &quot;not a bill&quot; solution that they want so badly. I do not see any solutions for how we will build up our power grid to accommodate the mass influx into electric everything. Also, I cannot believe what people say about global warming. There was a study done by Yale I believe that disproves that the oceans are warming theory. They go into say that there has been too many inaccurate reading done by different countries to have any hard evidence. And not to long ago there was a group of people that demanded the immediate shut down of nuclear power plants. Theses same people demand that we go full electric. If theses people can&#39;t make the right decision then. How can we trust them now. I will vote for this &quot;not a bill&quot; when I am presented with feasible ways to switch over, backed by long term evidence and research. Not flowers crying about their feelings.

Implement a large carbon tax, which would increase the cost of fossil fuels and force firms to transition to green energy, and use the revenue as a UBI style rebate to offset the regressive nature of the carbon tax. This solution is 1. Pareto efficient, 2. doesn't require us to increase the size of the federal government. That being said, nothing is going to work without global cooperation.

To be honest though we don&#39;t have electric vehicles to fill in for the petrol vehicles we use now. Their is no way you are going to remove gas vehicles at this point unless you fill the gap with something else. And such an effort would have to be global to mean anything.

Petroleum (oil) 37% and natural gas 32%. Coal and renewable energies both make up about 11% each. Petroleum, natural gas, and coal are all finite resources. The more we use the less we have. The more we use the more expensive it is to extract what is left. Fracking to get oil has had damning effects on local ground water and (likely) increases the risks for earthquakes. Waste products from burning these resources worsens air quality for locals. Clearly we will have to come up with alternative energies eventually to cope with these realities. No one is saying solar, wind, geothermal, etc are perfect now but we won’t run out of sun, wind, ground, etc. That is why so many countries, scientist, engineers, etc. are working to further develop green energies.

What scientist? Also I’m not opposed to nuclear, but to dismiss other forms of energy doesn’t make sense to someone who has studied the pros and cons of alternative energy. In some places wind can be effective and done affordably, in some solar is, in some hydro is. No one is going to say we can only use ‘x’ and everyone must also use ‘x’. Just like how you don’t own your own gas power plant (much bigger gas-generator essentially) an energy system that is mostly green wouldn’t need everyone to own a solar panel. As we continue to develop more efficient solar panels, wind turbines, better ways to store energy, etc. green will continuously improve and become more affordable. Our large (mostly gas in the US) power plants are already at nearly peak efficiency in terms of extracting energy from the process. There is a much higher ceiling for alternative energy sources to meet our increasing energy demands.

An energy source that will continue to get more expensive to access as we use more of it. An energy source that is literally, by definition, unsustainable. Their is a finite amount of oil on the planet. Your plan is to ignore that and the warnings from scientists about global warming, in favor of continuing to use what has historically been used? Luckily with or without your support sustainable energy like wind, solar, hydro, geothermal, etc. will continue being developed and replacing oil and natural gas, similar to what happened to coal. Better to be a leader in the green energy space and invest in bettering your nations energy systems for future generations.

No one really needs a paper to stop you from driving a petro car or eating meat. Sad truth is that these industries only strive on the demand for their product or services. Anything from going for a quick bite at the fast food joint, to taking a flight to Las Vegas for the weekend even when you a buy a brand new phone. All of these are just convenient for the easy life and it&#39;s hard to let go. Even for Cortez that shouts out to stop Comercial flying but doesn&#39;t lead by example by showing how to do it the green way, instead she racks up a large spending in flying and Uber driving.<br /><br />Not here to bash on the lady I&#39;m sure she&#39;s going to do a great job one day. But it&#39;s an example of what I want to comment. Even if these politicians manage to get rid of one industries. With power they will not hesitate to indulge on what is not allowed for us. They are no different from us and they all wish for the good of earth. But at our expense and deaths this will be the only way to save earth if they do it by force. When that day arrives I will call it the Genghis Law.	UCrokrLeQUIJPGGDfJJrKoNQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrokrLeQUIJPGGDfJJrKoNQ	0

Why don't we set up a state or territory somewhere that models EVERYTHING the Green New Deal mandates . . . energy efficiency, equality etc. . . . and then see what happens? Then we'll have HARD EVIDENCE as to the true benefits of such a plan . . . instead of trying to convince people with hand waving, Microsoft excel charts, and virtue signaling. Anyone who want's to be part of the experiment is free to move there. If this plan is so good, it's bound to work, right? If not, you haven't lost a whole country. Side note: That's what I find so cool about our states . . . short of federal laws/ mandates, each one can pretty much govern as they see fit . . . which means we can really analyze the benefits/ hindrances of various policies.

Besides, at the end of the day in the US you are currently having a choice between two politicians in their 70s to be president for the next 4 years, because it's ultimately the parties that decide who is allowed to run and let's be fair here, regardless of which party you are, at 80 it's impossible to not be out of touch with what the younger generations need to thrive as the boomers were allowed to.

Paradoxically you have Capitalism which is a consumer+producer model and then you have the Green model which is a non-consumer model. Can&#39;t have both. For example people want to use cars (EV or other) which means you need to manufacture them and sell them in the Capitalistic system. However in a Green System you would want mass transit which means no cars are being produced as they are a waste of energy use and are a waste of energy to produce.

Not only that but Increased carbon results in higher plant yield, resistance to bacteria and viruses. Plants yield more fruit of larger sizes than normal. The higher the CO2 the more food we can produce. This is science. We also found out not long ago oil wells are not a finite resource. Previously closed wells have been reopened and are producing peak oil again. This is amazing but people don&#39;t hear about it. Democrats are evil racists, they have always been in opposition to the civil rights act, the voting rights act, the women&#39;s suffrage act, etc. They are trying to take control with this climate change BS its a lie. Revelation clearly says that there will be signs like earthquakes and storms all over. Jesus told us this will happen so don&#39;t lie about CO2 or why this is happening.

The problem is that we&#39;re just one country and we have no way to get the rest of the world to adapt to this. If you think other countries would be willing to go through with this you&#39;re sadly mistaken, Humans are greedy by nature and no one is going to be willing to give up all their power until it&#39;s too late. So if we were the only ones to go through with this we&#39;d not only be demanding that our country completely changes its way of life but we&#39;d also give up what makes us as a country powerful and lets act as a deterrent in the first place. We&#39;d lose what makes us a superpower and become completely reliant on other countries to survive. Sadly this deal is just unrealistic but i truly hope we can all come together to figure out a way out of this, if not that then at the very least get off this planet before it dies as sad as it is to say.

Plus many other concepts have been presented but as always, squashed. How did Tesla create free energy? Nikola Tesla was a scientist and inventor known for his patents and grand ideas about bringing the world “free energy”. The invention that was to produce wireless energy is called the Tesla Coil. ... It is made of a primary and a secondary coil, and each has its own “capacitor”, or energy storage.

But how can you get a job,if you dont have home to stay in, or ground to stand on. <br /><br />The green new deal might lead to a dead end, since this is the only solution for humanity for now.<br /><br />Who knows we might even be already too late to make the change, for centuries and centuries. Humans have wandered the Earth, we never realized how reckless our doings were. being reckless can backfire.<br /><br />But if we keep on doing this, it will end all life for earth. Sacrifices and risks must be taken from time to time, we already built nuclear power plants,or nukes.<br /><br />And if we leave them off, they&#39;ll crumble and spread radiation. Harming all life near it. We humans left a REALLY harmful carbon footprint. One that cannot be irreversible,why are we still doing this.<br /><br />Even though this might be harmful to the children&#39;s future. Is there really a way that takes no harm and risk.

The problem with the green new deal is twofold. First it&#39;s not economically viable. It would cost all the money that everyone in the United States makes and that 10-year period to implement the changes that were recommended. That doesn&#39;t even address the fact that no other country on the planet would be participating in that program and thus put only lower the average World temperature by .5% The second part is even more troubling in that it was revealed by AOC&#39;s former Chief of Staff that the green New Deal was really about changing the economy more so than fixing the environment. And basically we don&#39;t trust y&#39;all to make those decisions for us. <br />If you want to help out the problem and not go broke trying then take smaller steps concentrating on problems you can fix yourself and Technology generally has a way of making things better.

Making automobiles accessible requires achieving massive economies of scale in the production and supply chain process of vehicle manufacturing. Actually, the process of making EVs more accessible is already underway as we speak, in the following ways: 1. All vehicle manufacturers (not only TSLA) are pouring billions of dollars into setting up production plants for EV models. 2. They're also investing billions in EV battery production. These batteries are a substantial portion of the cost of EVs, so as batteries become cheaper to produce, the EVs will also become cheaper to produce. 3. Supply chains are shifting to accommodate EV production behind the scenes, so to speak. 4. Investments are also going into scaling up power (electricity) infrastructure to accommodate the coming wave of EV cars. 5. An adjunct to point 4 is the installation of chargers for "refueling" EVs along several routes. Just like you currently drive into a gas station to refuel your car, people will be able to drive into a recharging station to recharge their vehicle. Within the next 3 years, I expect EVs to cost significantly less than they do now, in terms of both upfront purchase price, and also ongoing ownership costs.

That made me realize that the world is indeed changing because of climate change. <br /><br />For the past few years, my country has encountered a lot of natural disasters that had killed a lot of living beings and also destroyed creations. I can&#39;t stand the thought of what will be the future like if we continued to live this way. <br />You may not have the utmost power to convince everyone that it is real and happening, but at least start it upon yourself. Just by understanding and acknowledging this issue, it is already a big step.	UC8H4PMXUpw_oU0ABQmFdPQg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8H4PMXUpw_oU0ABQmFdPQg	0

Sure there are some that were more dangerous than most of the recent ones but if it is happening to frequently and add the big disasters as well, ain't that a result of climate change already?

Not that the world is going to end. People who believe that do not do any research for themselves. co2 is the reason we have life. Us putting co2 back in the air was why the world as a whole was greening. The world was lacking co2 and has been steadily decreasing it for over 500 million years. Educate yourselves people.

That being said, I disagree with the claim that carbon tax would harm the economy. If you simply look at GDP growth, then yeah that would most likely slow. But from basic micro, we know that under negative externalities (such as CO2 emissions), the market is not allocatively efficient, and that levying a pigouvian tax (in this case a carbon tax, although it's easy to show cap and trade schemes are economically equivalent) can fix this inefficiency. Edit: The problem with non-market based approaches is that you no longer have the price mechanism to ensure that people consume up to the point where societal marginal cost meets societal marginal benefit.

Better idea is to streamline the process to build nuclear plants and build loads of them. that'd power EVs and production machinery much cheaper, safer, and cleaner than sources like mass solar or wind.

That way the poor aren't hit too hard, we transition to green energy, and we don't have to spend trillions in subsidies/government programs, most of which would likely be very inefficient. Basically, something like the ACES bill that passed the House in 2009 but didn't pass the Senate.

The same is true of carbon, something that's been understood of the element since the 1800's, where scientists then predicted that adding more CO2 into the atmosphere would raise the temperature of the planet, as the element is again, conductive of heat. In fact, it's actually the only argument scientists make, as the "natural climate change" theory was proven wrong when it was discovered that the Earth is actually in the process of going *into* an ice age, not out. This and other environmental factors would mean that without human and fossil fuel impact, the Earth would actually be cooling.

Also the real climate scientists that aren&#39;t being paid by the government say that.... yes people have an effect on the climate, obviously. But it&#39;s not enough to cause this issue on it&#39;s own. We do not understand the climate on this planet. It will rise and it will fall. Just like it has always done. Just look back 30,000 or 40,000 years and follow the climate charts until today. It&#39;s right there. This always happens and has been way worse. Yes it will be devastating but that&#39;s just life on earth. We cant stop it. The green deal will have zero effect on climate change. Its true. It&#39;s all there if you do the research. This coming from a liberal perspective/ Democrat. Listen to some of the climate scientists on the joe rogan show.

At the same time Clean Fuel Energy Corp opened a Renewable natural gas/ biomethane fueling station. Burning methane from organic waste seems one combustion engine permitted in the Green New Deal.

I&#39;m old enough to remember that Florida and New York were supposed to be under water by now. I&#39;m old enough to remember when &#39;climate change&#39; was global warming...and before that global cooling. And I&#39;m educated enough to know that The Green New Deal would do exactly nothing to change global climate. The Green New Deal is about changing America into a socialist &#39;utopia&#39; not about changing global temperatures.

Remember, your reading on a product that is created through Oil, Coal, and natural gas. This will be the removal of all electronic devices globally, and that is a start. All solar and wind products are made with oil and gas as well as all electric cars, batteries. Don&#39;t forget trains, roads, buses and of course our clothing. So, by reading the basis of the Green Deal, the only logical solution would be to eliminate the need for oil, gas and such. Yep you guessed it, the reduction of human population.The only green being made will be by the Oligarchs, oh excuse me; Masters who run the new World. Food for thought; maybe we all can start by consuming less, live minimalist life and not act so self important? Normally don&#39;t respond to anything online but we need to start with logic, not emotions.	UCI817nBJGZZ_0NTn_emSZZA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI817nBJGZZ_0NTn_emSZZA	0

The majority of this increase was when no fossil fuels were being burnt. So no I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to say this is a global catastrophe. Winters in the northern hempisphere in the 1990&#39;s were much warmer, now winters are much colder. So there is no real evidence of a terminal future, in the meantime a green new deal would put the economy back decades. The american people won&#39;t buy it unless you come up with something that&#39;s going to provide more evidence and a deal that isn&#39;t going to hurt people so much.

Maybe you need to learn the definition of freedom? Being stuck and dependent on a job that will inevitably go extinct at some point anyways (due to automation) is not freedom. Certainly not when you're dependent on that job for your health care and basic needs. I don't know about you, but I support the idea of competition in the marketplace. There isn't much competition to provide good paying jobs, when the vast majority of your employees are dependent on that job to survive. Thomas Jefferson called that "wage slavery".

One was contained without harm to anyone, the next involved an intense fire without provision for containment, and the third severely tested the containment, allowing some release of radioactivity.  These are the only major accidents to have occurred in over 17,000 cumulative reactor-years of commercial nuclear power operation in 33 countries.  The evidence over six decades shows that nuclear power is a safe means of generating electricity. The risk of accidents in nuclear power plants is low and declining. The consequences of an accident or terrorist attack are minimal compared with other commonly accepted risks. Radiological effects on people of any radioactive releases can be avoided.	UCBe_EqZEOniPhxJHhX12i-Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBe_EqZEOniPhxJHhX12i-Q	1	UgwnYjf1MN0MPCAkBDF4AaABAg	Dale Ralls

Solar panels take up lots of land and will probably end up in Africa in the next 20 years with the rest of our electronic waste and wind turbines affect wildlife and are very unreliable. The best solution is nuclear until we figure out fusion reactors.	UCI-V52mitMKubtBzmYvS3gQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI-V52mitMKubtBzmYvS3gQ	1	UgykYvtVOiHYzH6SP9t4AaABAg	magma?

You have to blow up mountains to get the materials needed and the waste it produces doesn't go away for millions of years. I wouldn't have a problem with using it to save us some time but it just isn't a permanent solution. We need to stop thinking about solutions from moment to moment and look as long term as possible.

If we covered all the earths energy needs with nuclear, it would last 4-8 years. It takes decades to build one power plant and it costs billions. Then you’re left with radioactive waste with a half-time of 10,000 years. We don’t have decades. And we need energy for far more than 4-8 years.

Increasing carbon emissions has also lead to a natural greening effect of the planet since CO2 is...well...plant food.(We’ve increased the carbon content of our atmosphere from 0.03 to 0.04% since we started burning fossil post industrial revolution almost 300 years ago.)

About Co2, yeah, co2 is a neccesary component to do photosyntesis, but it needs to be a balance in emissions/absortion of co2, if we emmit more co2 than the plants convert to O2 then CO2 would end having a negative effects, not everything in abundance is positive, for example, nitrogen is a key nutrient to plants, but if you pour too much amoniac(nh3) in the soil you will end killing up the plant.

Have companies let their employees to work from home, will reduce the drive to work. There is so much to do, if there would be enough people out there to understand the outcome of our future and our kids future and other after that, that one day it will be too late to go back and fix all this. <br /><br />I stand by the new green deal, I hope you will have a stronger message in senate next time, but at the same time work around with people with influence.

Since this democratic version was written you can find it called the ecosocialist green new deal. 2nd, they claim the dems will certainly implement it in 2020 if they win power, which is just proaganda. Much of the dems are still opposed to the gnd because they are owned by the corporations the gnd would destroy. Only a few dems would actually move this forward, whereas every Green has promised to work toward the gnd since its conception.

You are also assuming the stability of our current system, which is incredibly unstablev and we are overdue for an economic downturn. You imply we ought to do nothing when drastic times call for drastic measures. Our economy totally collapsed just over a decade ago, and people are really suffering still. In the 30s when that happened, fdr confronted the economic crash, the dustbowl, and a lot of the people's needs after strong unions led by socialists demanded the nd. This led to the most prosperous economic period in history. As a result of the nd, Americans built a lot that was previously inconceivable. It worked because the goal was not profit, but people (except minority communities). This is the kind of bold change our country needs again even if it leads to less consumption overall (with some modern changes). In the 21st c, there are other ways to ensure a booming economy without perpetuating a throw-away culture of toxic products made with toxic energy backed by the gamblers of wall st. If we continue the way we are going we will have nothing left. I'm going to put this simply: other animals don't foul their water, and humans have done this on a massive scale. Money is just a stand in for what we prioritize as a society, and right now, and things like clean water and keeping the sea levels from engulfing our cities ought to be at the top of our list. Your naysaying does nothing, but the gnd is an agreement to focus on and environmental-economic strategy to overhaul the old industrial system that isnt working for Americans.

UgxOo5iA6nNbSN3ae0J4AaABAg.8xNS7zI5VHp8xYoEqLFvX8		1	2019-07-19 03:14:13	Brian	Eagle-winged Turtle Your assuming: 1. This will create jobs and generate economic growth 2. This will increase industry and increase economic growth. In order to create jobs you first have to actually create products or grow an industry, which means you have to have an understanding of what you are building. The GND does not do this. Any sensible energy transition plan should be able to tell you: - how much generation is required to sustain a society - how much capacity and generation your energy sources will have. If I ask a GND supporter how much solar capacity the GND plans to increase in any given year, can you answer this question? No, because not only does the GND provide ZERO data of any kind in terms of actual power generation or projected capacity increases, it doesn’t even specify what type of energy sources it plans to use beyond just renewable. Additionally in order to grow the industry you have to have a good understanding of how that energy source is used. The GND wants to massively increase renewable capacity. Ok just using data from the US BLS and assuming every home in the USA uses a 7.5KW solar array, you can calculate that the net generation from residential solar is approximately 36% of our net portfolio. That’s great but not even close to being enough to replace fossil fuels or other energy sources. Here’s where the GND is devoid of logic. If you have to use more than residential solar this will require you to build- utility scale wind and solar. Utility scale wind and solar takes up sq miles of land. You cannot build these within city limits, and in order to maximize your production you will want to build large arrays which produce very large amounts of power. The GND contains ZERO language of any kind about transmission infrastructure. This doesn’t make any sense. 1. Using low voltage power line to transfer electricity across large distance will cause significant power loss due to overheating of lines. 2. If you attempt to transfer very large energy loads ok distribution cable the heat generated in the process will literally fry your line and potentially cause it to catch on fire. Unless you are planning on completely redesigning urban development of every city in the USA you will require transmission line to transfer your electricity from utility scale solar and wind to your cities, but apparently the GND doesn’t want to use any transmission infrastructure. This suggests either the co-sponsors want to completely redesign this country or they have no idea how electricity is actually transferred in this country. This is just one example of how the GND is complete utter nonsense. As for economic growth, if you can’t supply electricity to your industries and businesses your economy will collapse as they are unable to produce their products.

The problem is nobody can afford this I would literally have to drop out of school because I wouldn’t drive a car anymore because whatever this thing will cost will take priority. I would need probably more than 2 jobs. It’s one thing to promise something but to maintain it. If history has shown climate change it’s always going to happen by nature’s course regardless if we do anything about it. But this will cause more harm than you think. I mean the whole point of progression is to start changing technology by improving it and upgrading it. Cars is a prime example gas is much more cleaner than it was when cars were first introduced. The electric car is making its mark right now. Pass the Green New Deal that’s going to end all progression.

Mining rare earths and precious metals requires a lot of energy, usually produced by burning fossil fuels. Refining, manufacturing, assembling also requires vast amount of energy. That smartphone has probably been produced in Shenzen, China, where over 60% of energy production is done by burning coal. Shipping also relies on fossil fuels. Delivering the smartphone to the store/warehouse also is not runned on rainbows and dandelions . Charging the phone requires energy and, unless you are living in Iceland or Costa Rica, you are using fossil fuels (again). Disposal will also require energy for dismantling and recycling (if we are lucky).

Solar and wind farms take up an impressive amount of land...for large cities and even small cities, it would wipe out many farming communities. A small solar farm only supplies power to a few buildings, its the same with wind farms. Thats just a small amount of the problems that would arise. Taxes would sky rocket, jobs would be lost, they say we'll protect the workers, how when the economy goes haywire because only a few can afford to put money back into the economy, last i checked you need a job to make money....oh here's the answer, lets let the rich pay the taxes....there is not enough rich people to cover that...thats why they are called the 1%ers.

It was first proposed in the UK, and in part inspired by Energy and Tax policies in Norway. Unfortunately the paper was published just before the 2008 recession, so the left wing government of the time end up completely ignoring it whilst they dealt with the banks. By the time it had all settled down the Conservatives were in power, and they believe pretty strongly in de-regulation and privatisation, so it didn't stand a chance.

Predicting where lightning is going to strike is almost impossible (as far as I know), so you can’t build a tall metal structure to catch the lightning because it would have to move around to catch the lightning. Contrarily, nuclear energy is a much more likely solution as it’s very energy dense. Another pro to nuclear energy is that Thorium is three times more plentiful than Uranium and has no reactors yet.

Also those &quot;promises&quot; such as &quot;guarantee&quot; of employment, health care, etc. are not very reassuring because, as Robert Burns said, &quot;the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry&quot; and tbh, the NGD does not seem like the best laid plan.

But to redesign how a society is supposed to function is going to take more than 10 years to implement. And by then, temperature is predicted to be hitting the +2.5 degree mark by then. What we need to focus is renewable energy, especially China, but we can't decomission fossil fuels completely as it will destabilize the market of oil, gas and other means of resources. Plus, other countries rely on importing oil to the US. What will happen to those countries? America can't be self interested all the time, making the country better is great for America, but how they do that also affects the world. Remember that.

We don't need to rebuild whole cities, we need to transition to renewable sources of energy, forbid entirely combustion cars, etc. What would had happened if people said "it doesn't matter, other countries are worse/have a worse situation" when slavery was legal? Make those changes can make a difference, USA have the size of Europe, it's worth even if just avoid one hurricane more per year. Not to talk about the obviousness of that we have limited resources and the need of get rid of petroleum dependence. Btw, if we have 2 dollars now, we'll have only 1 later to pay a biggest bill and China needs to do something about pollution, it has a big economic impact and it's slowing the growth of the country.

Because everything, from the invasion, to the overthrow of hostile governments, to the imposition of 'nice' governments, to the taking of resources for the US' 'benefit', all goes through PRIVATE CORPORATIONS. Private corporations, who lobby the government to introduce legislation that will benefit them, because they have the millions and billions, instead of bringing prosperity to the people. Lobbying is no different to bribing elected Congresspeople. The taxpayer money that is spent on ALL OF THIS is too bewildering to even fathom. That's the cost of Pax Americana.

Their entire MO is using hyperbolic language in order to get a response. 2. No they didn't. They said *America* had to and specifically explained why *America* does. China and every other country is a completely different beast and can/will tackle problems in a way that best suits them. 3. China can and is. At least if you accept that "all at once" is hyperbolic. The way China works is completely different from Western democracies. If Beijing wants something it happens and it happens fast. They went from two high speed test lines in 2008 to more high speed rail than everyone else on Earth put together by 2018. Also unlike most other countries they exceed expectations more often than not. Their original clean energy proposal, for example, was to move to 20% "non-fossil fuels" by 2030 but they meet that target more than a decade early hitting 24% in 2015 and have since been taking on renewable energy projects on mass. In China's case though renewable energy isn't as big a concern as smog in their cities which is why much of their efforts have been surrounding industrial pollutants, transport as well as farming, steel and concrete alternatives. If Beijing decides they want to go zero emissions, and it looks like that's what's going to happen, it'll happen (figuratively) overnight. Because unlike America China doesn't have to pretend to care about people losing jobs or uprooting entire sections of their economy or politicians lying about proposals in order to dishonestly drum up fear and avoid actually addressing the reality of what's being asked.

Big cities have taken some drastic measures to reduce the number of new cars on the road and only certain license plate numbers can be on the road on certain days - forcing people to take public transit. Additionally they're taking steps to ensure that most of the new cars on their roads moving forward will be electric. They have the largest high speed rail network in the world reducing air travel and highway use between most cities. They're launching the largest clean energy projects in the world and currently produce more renewable energy than any other country in the world. America has a fancy branding term for their "green new deal" but China's been working on an almost identical effort since at least as recent as 2008.

A simple search of "Countries by greenhouse gas emissions" shows that the US (responsible for 14.75% of global emissions) is number 2 to China(27.51%) and India (6.43%) is third. The majority of other countries account for less than 1% each. America believes that they are a super power, a world leader in technology, democracy and fiscal policy. Its time we grow up and accept our responsibility in saving the planet. We're meant to be the leader. Quit whining about other countries until you do your part in combating climate change. Be brave to lead the pack, then China and India may follow.

How about the money that was supposed to fund Space force? Or we can start taxing the rich a little more. How about we actually start regulating the market properly to insure that they don't hide money in accounts far away in Sweden? In turn that should generate more money for the people. The list goes on and on and on. There are many ways we can pay for it. There is an abundance in useless taxes as well that can help fund The Green New Deal.

Did you know that 1 acre of hemp can produce 300 gallons of oil while not depleting the land? It is estimated that a state like Maine could satisfy it&#39;s own heating fuel needs without interfering with current agriculture. Not to mention dramatically slow deforestation as a significant source of paper pulp. The best thing is we could see full implementation in a very short period of time.

Back in the day, families would just grow their own food and their jobs were relatively local. It was all community. But now we buy from supermarkets, travel all over the world.. we want everything. We would have to force ourselves to &quot;go local&quot; again in order to reduce our activities on Earth. Remember, more people = more resources are needed to sustain the population.

Both are a means of transporting electrical energy, which would ideally come from solar and wind. Technically, H2 can also be synthesised from the steam reformation of methane, which would make it a fossil fuel derivative. This is where H2 mostly comes from today, but the future is electrolysis based on renewable power.

We have all the technologies we need and at costs that are comparable or cheaper than fossil fuel based sources. The ones that are not, such as hydrogen, just need scaling up. It is far less wasteful to mine for lithium pegmatites or pump out of salars because all that lithium adds to the stock. It is not a consumable like oil which needs drilling and pumping all the time. People arguing against this (and there are these clowns all over social media these days) are neither engineers nor economists, but clueless old boomers and dodgy real estate agents who get their half baked information from the Murdoch media.

We're going to consume resources, one way or another. We've been burning wood as fuel since pre-historic times. It's only recently that we've been putting this much carbon into the cycle. Our aim is to reduce our carbon footprint back to sustainale levels. Lithium is recycled. If taken care of, a lithum battery can last years, and then be recycled to be used *again.* Once gasoline and natural gas is burned, it's gone, or at least in someone else's lungs.

We obviously require a carbon free or carbon neutral solution for those people long term too but his point is a solution for a big percentage of the population is impactful even if it doesn’t totally reach zero emissions. Tackling this problem will include many strategies working together and it isn’t surprising that different technology will be needed for different people with different needs. Clearly you are distorting his words for your own agenda. What he was saying was in no way negative towards those outside of urban areas.

It&#39;s just another greenwashing PR campaign to further certain political careers.<br />If these campaigners were serious about dealing with this issue, they would be specific in their requests. Instead everything is intentionally vague, and that&#39;s why they came up with 14 pages of useless words.<br />There&#39;s three things the government has to do to fight global warming:<br />1. Stop subsidizing fossil fuel companies.<br />2. Stop subsidizing &quot;green&quot; projects. The vast majority of these green subsidies are just money given to aid politically connected businesses so that they can spend them on impractical projects in order to enrich themselves even more.<br />3. Put a tax on carbon emissions that&#39;s directly linked to the atmosphere&#39;s CO2 concentration. This will take care of everything and will guarantee that money goes only to the fastest, most efficient and most effective green projects.

I don’t understand why the government doesn’t try to indirectly help the environment by changing tax legislation. Offer small tax breaks to companies that do something for the environment (electric cars, air filters that convert CO2 into a low emissions fuel, nuclear and solar power plants, or even something small like serving food that’s locally sourced) and you’re guaranteed to get the companies to do the job for you. Most of them already invest being more environmentally friendly. Offer an incentive for it and they’ll invest much more heavily.

While yes, if everyone drove electric, there would be greater energy demand to charge those cars, when it comes to fossil fuel energy generation, it's more efficient to generate energy around the clock in a power plant, compared to the energy a car potentially wastes.

It will take tousands of pages of economic steps for each industry and community with bi-partisan sponsors.	UCKcNseDIshpy9v80w1ODAqQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKcNseDIshpy9v80w1ODAqQ	0

There is hard evidence that the recent rise in CO2 is attributed to man. The level of CO2 has not been higher than 350ppm in over 1 million years, we are currently at just over 400ppm. Before 1950 CO2 was consistently below 300ppm for 800,000 years. There have been many "ice ages" and warmer periods during this time which were attributed to changes in the earth orbit and solar activity. The recent increases seen in the earths temperature do not correlate with solar activity which has been on a relative decline. The level of CO2 in the atmosphere has not been this high in millions of years, last time it was this high temperatures would have been much higher and seas were much higher. The impact of climate change (along with pollution of various kinds) can be seen clearly, scientists believe we are in the middle of the 6th mass extinction, at least 1,000,000 species are at risk of disappearing in the next 50 years. The ecosystems we depend on to survive - to eat - are eroding. Crops are failing more regularly around the world, this will only get worse. The information is out there, you just have to find it and read it. It is hard to disagree with predictions made on factual evidence. Check the NASA climate change website or the UN, or IPCC or any of the other multitude of sources. This is NO JOKE. I have a degree in Biosciences therefore I am educated enough to understand what is actually a very complicated piece of science, it is a shame that not every one can understand. Although maybe ignorance is bliss.	UC-9_sB_Whwkff7637yrFddw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-9_sB_Whwkff7637yrFddw	1	UgwV8dcvjICti9pvfDV4AaABAg	Games2567

And YES we have seen the conequences allready! What do you mean the climate has not changed! We have proof and scientific research saying that temperatur has drastically changed. AND the proof is right in front of us too! Extreme weather! Wildfire, tsunamis, tornados, tons of rain etc... There is more and more of it every day! How do you explain that!! I live in Norway which is a very cold country. The summer here is not very warm but it has become more warm every year and last summer was the warmest summer in many, many years.

That means overwhelming carbon emitting fuels. Not to mention all the concrete which ahead comprises 8% of CO2 emissions.<br /><br />The Green New Deal is a giant virtual signal that will destroy everything.

Personally the deadline and additional regulations in my opinion will make it impossible for this construction to take place, but assuming that it could even happen how do you imagine that a continental public transit system, continental shift to disturbed energy grids and continental transition to renewables would not skyrocket emissions in construction, when there are no substitutes at necessary scale for how these materials are created and built? Look at China. Even with their massive investments to transition the country to renewable sources they are increasing CO2 emissions- how could that be possible? Because with rapid industrial movements CO2 emissions increase dramatically in construction and material creation sectors. If you want to mitigate CO2 emissions effectively you need a long timeframe and you needs to do it systematically so that in the process of your transition you do not increase emissions dramatically making your transition completely voided of purpose.

The entire construction industry contributes to 23% of air pollution, and that is counting skyscraper with heavy use of metal for foundation. So no, infrastructure rebuilding of coal power plant does not emit more co2. Nobody is rebuilding every car. AOC advocated for investment in public transit and zero emission car, not rebuilding.

Right now renewables provide 3% of all energy planet wide. We've got to rebuild then 97% of every power facility on earth, rebuild every car, build vast networks of bullet trains, rebuild or retrofit every building in the developed works etc. All that will be done with fossil fuels before we will get any savings of CO2 at all. It's called carbon debt, the carbon you have emit short term to save carbon long term. But the debt can be very large, the faster you go-to the bigger the v sect overall.

I understand that enviromentalists and anti capitalists are having a field day because of all the things that have to end (because they already hated them) but this needs to be fixed. If we don't fix this then we will loose everything. The natural world and also all the goodies and confort that development gave us. We are talking about massive dying and conflict. I'm sure this looks too much as a dooms day approach but this is a realization that took me some time to understand and accept.

It would not matter if we got rid of the 600b the military spends, the medicare for all would cost us 40 TRILLION. That's only ONE of several bills the democrats want us to spend for without any method of paying for them. IF we do what the democrats want, our national debt will increase 5 fold in one year.

Batteries are terrible for the environment as well both to build and to dispose of, and the electrical transfer between charging the batteries from solar in the day then recalling that batty power at night results is 20-30% loss of usable power. Not to mention communities that have large solar and wind farms like California rely heavily on fossil fuels to make up the difference. Nuclear power isnt all that bad most of our military uses small nuclear power reactors for its ships which means we already have a few hundred power plants around the world in our oceans. And guess what they are helping the environment cuz its clean energy! If we can drop the negative stigmatizum on mental health and criminals why cant we do it for nuclear power?

If we started investing in nuclear energy 20 or 15 years ago the situation would be a lot less dramatic. Nowadays, we have little time to prepare for climate change, so the easier way is to build lots of cheaper solar panels and wind turbines in less time, which is visual pollution, but it's better than climate change.

I’m studying nuclear engineering and the sheer amounts of power reactors push out is incredible with little environmental damage. It is the second most efficient source of energy behind hydro but hydro destroys habitats. The green new deal forget to mention this energy power house, and use unreliable sources of energy. As well, this trillions the deal costs can be cut down SIGNIFICANTLY. So as the green new deal has a good intention I believe the execution is terrible. The costs of the deal split among the people would add an additional 600k per household, you do the math. Taxes would be crazy.

You will actually be exposed to more radiation from a coal plant than a nuclear one ironically. It's really goofy to use the absolute worst case scenario as something that happens frequently. A nuclear meltdown has happened a total of 2 times within the last 70 years of nuclear power. And both incidents were issues with using old and outdated tech. The Fukushima reactor didn't even have a back up generator for the reactor core. (Not to mention this after being hit by both a earthquake and a tsunami so this isn't very typical at all.) Chernobyl was using tech that was even outdated for it's time. Modern reactors don't have any of these issues. As far as nuclear waste goes that is the one legitimate problem with nuclear tech. Liquid salt reactors reduce the amount of waste and the volatility of that waste and there is even ways to reuse old waste but safe storage is the current option. However, we are far closer to working out the kinks to nuclear energy than we are to making our renewable tech like solar and wind more viable and cost effective. All energy forms have downsides but nuclear tech is far cheaper, energy rich and even a smaller environmental impact than renewable and nonrenewable energy alike.

The tech used in Chernobyl and Fukushima was so out dated that it had no business being in service. Modern reactors don't really have that issue. Especially that new salt reactor that came out a few months back.While nuclear is not renewable, it is incredibly energy dense. A piece of uranium the size of a Coke can give a single person power for the rest of there lives. Solar, Wind, Hydro etc. Are nowhere near capable of providing that level of energy. And going back to the times nuclear has gone "nuclear" the amount of lives lost were not nearly what was projected. The radiation exposure in Fukushima hasn't killed a single person. Even deaths in Chernobyl which we thought were in the hundreds of thousands to even millions were really a couple hundred. (I mean there was an increased risk in thyroid cancer in Chernobyl but this form of cancer is far easier to treat than other variants. Not to mention more research into nuclear energy gets us closer to fusion.	UCg4WOPy7ybySz7Mz7ktTVTA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg4WOPy7ybySz7Mz7ktTVTA	1	Ugy27tfFwuRKkz4Zkfx4AaABAg	Jason mugford

So this "Green New Deal" won't actually solve the climate "problem", which means there is another agenda to it... namely socialism... which (a) doesn't work because it creates an elite group who are in control and get wealthy at the expense of others and (b) is inherently evil because it creates an elite group who are in control and get wealthy at the expense of others.

If you want people to pollute less, propose a tax break/cut to corporations that reduce their pollution by so much or that make certain switches. GMC (General Motors Company, not just the truck brand) is going completely electric by 2021, and many other companies will do the same in time, but a tax incentive will cause them to do so faster. That being said, China will make up for America’s lack of pollution by polluting even more with now cheaper fossil fuels.

That turned into a country who's economy was planned by a central committee who would decide quotas for each product in the country which ended in a complete economic collapse because they were unable accurately produce needed supplies while over producing others which combined with an isolation policy led to collapse. England has strong socialist learning up into the 1980s going as far as to subsidize the coal industry creating a national power crisis. Thatcher put an end to the coal subsidy and tried to stimulate the economy by following Regan like policies. I can go on with Sweden or even the what I call flavor of the week Venuzuala. My point is that what this deal is asking for is a complete and utter upheaval of the status quo with a strong progressive centralized beaurcracy. I am very concerned for our environment and how it is being destroyed in countless ways. I am however also a pragmatist and even if we could get all 300 million Americans on board we still have countries like China who creating more environmental hazards in a month than what we do in a year.

The guy spouting &quot;zero emissions&quot; has no grip on reality. The lights they are using to film come from energy. The chair he is sitting in is made using the energy he is denouncing. The pictures on his wall, his dog&#39;s collar, even the shirt he is wearing. The car he drives (any plastic in that &quot;green&quot; electric car? maybe a synthetic fiber?), the way he cooked his eggs earlier, and the light switch he turns on moving into the next room are provided by energy. Everything we touch is provided by natural resources. Light from the sun can&#39;t replace the base molecules of plastics. As you type your angry reply you are doing so on a keyboard that started with oil pumped from the ground to improve our lives. I love the earth too, just don&#39;t climb on a plastic soapbox and preach hypocrisy about how others should stop depending on oil when you so obviously do.

Cassava is Costa Rican, bell peppers are from Mexico (if you want to sell prime quality at a proper price). Ginger is Chinese or Costa Rican. Even some oranges come from Mexico and ones Brazilian oranges are allowed back,they’ll become dominant. The best and best priced produce is foreign, and it is not as easy as it sounds to start growing those locally or even within the country.

But even those are safer than most types of current energy. Look it up, nuclear is the safest type of energy, even safer than wind energy. The waste can be sealed tightly and stored safely. Even if someone of the future did manage to find it, it wouldn't matter unless they intentionally released the waste. Not to mention, we could also use the enriched uranium from decommissioned nuclear weapons for reactors. Solar panels are actually worse. When they break, they leak hazardous chemicals that aren't sealed safetly and that can contaminate the water. Good solar panels are made to last about thirty years iirc. But cheaply made ones (typically from China) can break in as little as five years and leak all those chemicals. I get that nuclear has a stigma surrounding it, but we could've achieved energy independence already if we had went all-out in the past.

And I agree that we should be doing something about climate change (we should've done something decades ago). Any and all forms of renewable energy like solar and hydropower should be utilized, along with fission reactors that don't use uranium and create less worrisome waste. I'm only advocating this *until* we reach fusion. Not being passive with the solutions.

However, it is still unwise to do nothing about the issue of climate change and wait passively for a solution be it nuclear or renewable. The reason why this is the case is because yes a switch in the way we produce power would be great. Production of power though only accounts for roughly %30 of the global emissions of greenhouse gasses. Fossil fuels would still be prevalent among industry, transportation among other sources. Solutions to emissions reduction would still need to be found as those problems are not all directly related to energy production.

If the climate change science is to believed and rising temperatures, among other things, cause sea levels to rise, you will see mass migrations. These migrants must go somewhere and where they choose to go those areas they go to will suffer the strain of having to deal with a sudden influx of people. Rising sea levels will also mean a loss of much of our landmasses and some of our farmland which will put a strain on food production meaning many mass starvation. This is only one of the potential effects of climate change and it is already devastating. It is true though. Nature will find a way, just we humans may not be there during its rebound.

They can not possibly tell you how much man is responsible because no one can tell how much nature is responsible. All you can do is find out how sensitive the atmosphere is co2 changes and history says it isn't. Despite what many so called "science" guys tell you, we are currently in an ice age and have been for millions of years. For 90% of earth history, there has been no permanent ice at the polls. What caused the ice to form in the first place was the Antarctic continent drifting over the south poll and the impact of the Indian and Eurasian plates creating the Himalayan mountains. When those two happened the temperature plummeted to what it is now in a (geologically speaking) relatively short time. At the time co2 was over 1200 ppm and could not prevent the formation of ice. So how can raising the co2 from 280 to 400 cause it all to melt? It cant. Every feedback they say co2 causes were in effect when co2 was 1200 ppm and it still could not prevent the ice age. Increasing it to 500 pp will NOT cause the ice age to end. Unless the ice age ends, not one of their dooms day prediction can happen. Without a dooms day, there is no reason to destroy our civilization to make a few people powerful. In case you have not heard, AOC's team has admitted that there was NEVER a climate risk, it was all about creating fear in people to make them give AOC and others the power to control the US.

They are definitely the number 1 producer of co2. Even india will soon be a bigger producer of co2 than the US. The problem is they expect the US to fund the changes. The only part of the Paris accord we have not already passed is the money to the UN and YET Everyone is so upset with us not "doing our part". Due to the corruption of the UN 90% of the money given to them is not used outside their own agency. Any money that is given would not have any restrictions on how it was to be used, so, for instance, North Korea could use it to buy nuclear material to bomb the US with US money. The government does NOT invent technology or patent it. President Trump offered to renegotiate the Paris accord with the US giving technological aid, but no one was interested in technology, only the money. I don't see no action as better than action, but useless actions is much worse than no action because it cost money and does nothing or makes the situation worse. Take for instance, the suggestions that we put things in orbit to reflect the sunlight away from earth to cool it. We are in an ice age, and the interglacial period will end in a matter of centuries, and yet they want to hurry that along. The truth is sceptics do not demand nothing be done, but we demand proof that uses REAL scientific procedures, which the alarmist refuse to use.

Nobody is saying the USA can solve this alone, just that we're in a position to lead the fight because we're heavily contributing.

I.e. he gave tons of money to other countries we should not have given to apologize for American being better at creating wealth. For instance almost all of nato's budget came from the US during Obama's presidency. 10% of our entire debt is due to the other counties not paying their fair share during Obama years. Add to the fact that we pay such a large portion of UN's budget and a lot of that was increased under Obama, and you can see that a large part of our debt is due to what went over seas.

The problem is, EVERY carbon tax plan made in the last 2 decades includes the ability to buy credits. What this does is raise the cost of the item but changes nothing. BUT in order to be able to buy credits you need a credit exchange and all the people pushing the demands for carbon taxes are on the board of directors for these carbon credit exchange companies. THAT means they make millions off it. IF the US had gone nation wide with its carbon tax in the early 2000, but 2008, Al Gore would have been the first carbon billionaire. EVERY prediction for 2100 is based on models that have failed already. ANYONE that claims that the climate will cause negative effects is lying because there is no evidence to support their claims. What good would it to for the US to completely wreck our economy to try to stop global warming when by 2025, china will be producing more co2 than the US, the EU and south American combined. According to many projections, by 2035, china will be producing over half the co2 in the world. MORE than the rest of the world combined!!!! What good does it do the world if almost ever other country besides the US is increasing their co2 output? The US output has flattened out but no one else has. YET everyone demands that the US destroy our economy to lower ours while they refuse to do anything to theirs.

GMC (General Motors Company, that is) is going completely electric by 2021, so every new car made by them from that point on will be electric. GMC makes more than luxury cars exclusively like Tesla, so they’ll be the first company to truly bring electric cars to the world. This also means that every other major automotive company will probably soon follow within the next ten years at most. Solar panels are pointless to get. They’re expensive to install, you need a battery to store energy in, the battery has to be replaced, you‘ll run out of power if it’s cloudy for a day or two, and batteries are literally some of the most difficult things to dispose of. You’re much better off getting electricity like most people do.	UChYGp22BINPSjZ59rBx59Tw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UChYGp22BINPSjZ59rBx59Tw	1	UgwxQwU3VMdPyoFRGy54AaABAg	Ayden

And to help people who lose their jobs, you’re going to spend more money to introduce universal healthcare. It seems very utopian. Honestly, I believe we need to take slow steps so that people begin to realize that there is this whole new economy that can be made by green energy. We need to start by creating jobs in cleaning the ocean and solar panel installations. But we need the money to incentivize people to change. It’s very hard to change when there is no money to make change.	UCoLusM3qiucdAlFZ0xjk7IQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoLusM3qiucdAlFZ0xjk7IQ	0

Not to mention that CO2 is not pollution it&#39;s a natural element necessary for the weather cycle. And when The tell you we will have less food that&#39;s totally wrong because plants eat CO2 and then they do better meaning better yields per plant just like in a green house where they actually add CO2. The truth is the earth is getting warmer but it&#39;s not in our control. And it&#39;s actually caused by water vapor from the sun hitting water which we cannot stop no matter how much money we throw at it. The good news is they cannot predict anything past two weeks. So when you hear about twelve years. Just think about the weather man telling you it will rain four Fridays from now. Go look for your self there are two groups on this and what they don&#39;t tell you is there a re a great deal of scientists that do not agree with this. Reason for the changes.

If co2 is capable of causing that kind of warming Antarctica could not have been froze more than 34 million years ago. Co2 was 1500+ ppm and Antarctica froze.<br /><br />The new Green Deal is nothing more than an attempt to take control over the worlds population so that a tiny group of people can become dictators.

Singapore has higher greenhouse gas emissions per capita than China despite having over 50 times the population density of China. The UK has similar emissions per capita as China despite having nearly twice the population density. And again, if you remove Western-owned industries from countries like China and India, their emissions would plummet. The West has reduced its emissions by shifting their emission-heavy industries to the third world over the years. Very sizable portions of the Chinese and Indian economies exist almost solely to supply the West with cheap goods and resources, and are almost exclusively owned by Western companies.

The only countries that routinely produce more per capita than the US are petro-states like Saudi Arabia and Qatar, which just the same supply the Western world. The US actually produces some 2.5 times as much greenhouse gas emissions per person than China, and over 8 times as much as India.

Stagnation? The USSR had stronger annual GDP growth than the US every single year from 1950 to 1988, the decline in 1989 is hopefully obvious. The famine wasn't caused by the liquidation of the kulaks so much as bad timing, seeing as drought during a time of massive agricultural restructuring is bound to cause problems, however the CPSU couldn't predict the weather of the next 5 years, could they? Not to mention considerable resistance from kulaks, typically burning their fields if they caught wind that they were next up to be liquidated. Still then, the famine was alleviated and recovered from quite rapidly, and became the last non-war-related famine in the history of the region, following regular famines during the Tsarist period. Again, this so-called "massive decrease" in economic productivity literally did not happen, effectively every measure showed that agricultural, and especially industrial, output had increased immensely between 1927 and 1937. Food security, something basically unheard of in the Tsarist era, was achieved in a span of less than a decade. The only measures that suggest otherwise are those calculating based on "value", which were outside calculations based on the final price of the agricultural goods which were being produced. These failed to take into consideration the massive subsidies provided by the state on food items, on top of collectivization already reducing the price of grain considerably.

Though if you're just a pencil pusher I could care less about your supposed "labor" as well. Also it actually did work pretty well in the USSR, considering that agricultural output increased immensely after the minority of wealthy landowners, who employed the other 90% of peasants, were removed from the equation. Quality of life increased immensely for the peasantry, food got much cheaper, and they were no longer struggling just to survive. Agricultural output was also diversified considerably after collectivization. By the 1950s, caloric consumption had far surpassed that in the US. Once agriculture was re-privatized through Perestroika, productivity declined rapidly and led to widespread food shortages. This intensified after the Soviet collapse, and it's taken over 20 years for many former Soviet states to recovered to pre-Perestroika agricultural output, many still being behind the old levels.

They too are limited by the Rankine cycle. All heat engines are limited by the Carnot cycle in the end. If you want to get down to the Physics, mechanical to electrical energy conversion via a dynamo is far more efficient than a heat engine. The issue is that the wind doesn’t blow equally hard all the time everywhere. So that’s what limits the output to about 40% of the rates power output over the year. With fossil fuels in a modern well supplied grid that factor is higher. For coal in a developed country it can be 85% though with cheap gas around it’s usually lower at 70-75%	UCbXVlB9O2myCDz2qq_nZ02g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbXVlB9O2myCDz2qq_nZ02g	1	UgxpB1jRLh1tNHmTSv94AaABAg	TyKOmain

Rather he’s saying we need to give nuclear a fair shake. If nuclear power, which is a much newer technology, received the same backing as solar it would be light years ahead. While solar and wind are cool and should be explored, they at the most produce power 20% of the time. For this reason we see countries like Denmark, which runs almost fully on wind power, pay some of the highest rates for power. On the other hand countries like France, which rely almost solely on nuclear power, pay some of the lowest rates. We simply don’t have the technology to make solar or wind work effectively right now and likely won’t have it for a few decades. If we need a solution now , it must be nuclear.

The historical relics you’re talking about have as much similarity to modern wind turbines as the musket to a Koch 416. The batteries for stationary storage are more often than not very different than the batteries for electric vehicles. I say more often than not because Tesla is marketing the same NMC chemistry in both but that’s just to make more dollars. Battery costs are crashing and will continue to crash as the variable cost of the raw material - for storage applications - is small compared to the overheads and capital recovery. So with scale the cost falls exponentially. At the same time coal power costs will go through the roof as the industry shrinks and the pool of manufacturers making steam turbines and supercritical boilers, not to mention longwalls and draglines, falls. It’s strange how some people such as yourselves don’t see the economics behind the costs of different forms of energy. There’s nothing inherently expensive about renewables, it’s all about scale. On the other hand, with fossil fuel the cost never ends because your always spending huge capex on exploration (oil and gas) or opex in digging up the coal.

Early rural electrification was first provided by wind turbines in some areas. Yet, the coal plant and transmission line were cheaper and more reliable - in the same way, the steam engine replaced the sail. Solar needs batteries to replicate the dispatchable characteristics of nuclear - this raises the cost exponentially. And any battery tech supplied should be used to make Musk's car cheaper and directly replace gasoline - not for the grid.

The U.S. should really stop invading other countries for resources and pretending to be "liberators" for many of these countries. They've done so for many decades. However, with the way the U.S. currently is, complete isolationism would not go well. The country would likely turn into a more laissez-faire capitalism or authoritarian country, like North Korea but with stronger military and better nukes. The U.S. system currently couldn't handle the job loss that automation would bring, nor the migration resulting from climate change.

Because for years now, conservatives have criticised green legislation for hurting the poor, or the middle class or the workers or whatever. Think about Trump's coalminers he always panders to. So they wrote a plan that doesn't hurt them. That's why social justice is part of the concept, to stop conservatives from bickering.

Many of the things this video stated are also stated within the Green New Deal. One major thing left out of the video is how the document also seeks to deal with some societal issues such as social injustice, homelessness, unemployment and poverty. IDK how to reference this document so i'll just say its on the bottom of page 5. These goals among other goals are to be achieved in a "10-year mobilization," called the Green New Deal Mobilization.

The majority of this increase was when no fossil fuels were being burnt. So no I don't think it's fair to say this is a global catastrophe. Winters in the northern hempisphere in the 1990's were much warmer, now winters are much colder.

The more countries that move away from oil, the more countries that will hoard oil and leverage it against everyone else in terms of industrial output. We have done a great many things but we're going to make this world borderline uninhabitable and we're doing nothing to stop it. If that isn't cause to be pessimistic, I don't know what is.

No one knows what to do with the waste. Even - or especially - the new nuclear people, not one of them actually has a plan for that. But they won't talk about it. Which leads me to believe that they just want to make quick money and in the end we'll have to pay for the waste. Again. Basically forever. All the studies that take this into account conclude that nuclear is just stupidly expensive because of that. It would be like a credit which we can never pay off but need to pay interest in constantly. Once someone actually has a working plan how to dispose of the waste, I think nuclear is a great technology - but until then (and that might never happen) it's really a bad idea	UCwHKhxUoEJtqB14stdmHBiQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwHKhxUoEJtqB14stdmHBiQ	1	Ugx1a2KdLOqZdiccCLZ4AaABAg	Ken Wells

This issue has been pushed aside for far too long and now that "pain," aspect of "no pain, no gain," has become very extreme as a result. If we had been easing our society off fossil fuels long before now we would not have to suffer this immediate and chaotic switch. Issues with the switch would of been identified and hashed out whereas now with such a sudden switch many societal norms will be flipped on its head and many hidden issues may arise.

Climate is in constant flux, always going up or down.. Within recorded history, the climate has changed over restricted areas.. Europe had a &#39;&#39;mini ice-age&#39;&#39; a few hundred years ago.. Greenland and Iceland were warm when the Vikings moved there, then they got so cold that people and livestock could not survive.. Now, their glaciers are melting as are glaciers in other parts of the world.. It&#39;s all guesswork and speculation.. What Mother Earth does, she does..

I’m all for stopping Global Warming, but it would cost nearly 100 trillion in a single year to go cold turkey on fossil fuels. Current renewable energy methods won’t work. Electric cars still run on co energy. It would run this land into anarchy before climate change would. <br /><br />We would need to transform all of New York into a solar farm to power the country. Plus, batteries for this tech are unadvanced. It would take all the lithium (which means strip mining) to get a weeks worth of energy that fossil fuels makes. Wind turbines only last about 30 years and cause noise pollution. We can’t dam every river for fear of destroying ecosystems. Tidal power doesn’t work. Nothing will work.<br /><br />I think we need to focus on helping the developing world on their emissions first, because they’re the ones without regulations. Reducing their emissions should be a main priority.<br /><br />Plus, A.O.Cortez is a terrible economist if she thinks it’s feasible. Socialism doesn’t work honey. You would have to tax us up to 80% for just the start of the project.	UCwcDUd2Yxdx5Mym4SkjDyMg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwcDUd2Yxdx5Mym4SkjDyMg	0

It&#39;s just a site for partisan point-scoring, not designed to actually pass and, importantly, not get repealed.<br /><br />We should work on a market-driven carbon tax/carbon credit system with bipartisan support. Punish the emissions and enact social policy along the way to help those left behind by the change. We have a dynamic safety-net already, so the major political barrier is determining the tax.

Carrying out those policies, like building solar farms, is like actually traveling through the chosen path towards the destination.

This kind of problem would&#39;ve been solved way sooner and easier if we didn&#39;t have countries, there would be no this country cheating, or that country trying to gain advantage by doing harmful activities, this is all because we don&#39;t trust each other and want to &quot;defeat&quot; each other because we&#39;re &quot;different countries&quot;.

This would send us into another depression, this would send the unemployment rate higher than we have ever seen before. Think about it. Truck driver&#39;s.

You just can't go 100% renewable unless you are a poor country with not a lot of population. You also need a good location depending on the climate.

The green new deal intends to put an end to destructive fossil fuel behaviour, and while the goal itself is commendable, it could quickly become an economic disaster worse than even the great depression if not properly managed - and it is highly likely that it won&#39;t be properly managed. Clearly, protecting the consumers via high-quality education, health care and other amenities is going to take a lot of tax money, and where is most of that money going to come from? - big corporations of course, which would also be taking the brunt of developing new clean energy tech. By doing all of this you&#39;re taking away the incentives for the companies to run; why would a company want to run if it&#39;s not profitable? They&#39;ll simply shift elsewhere. A bleeding good heart can&#39;t feed people, no matter what it&#39;s intentions. Good luck feeding the population with socialist principles	UCN78kgrHyNJ7AZmxYbF4xvg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN78kgrHyNJ7AZmxYbF4xvg	0

Our societies and governments did not exist in the past. Our cities and farmlands on the coast land did not exist in the past. What does exist now did not exist in the past and in historical circumstances our human society would be much different. The issue lies that with what we have now will be upended and changed for the worst should we let climate change occur. Millions will lose their homes, these new immigrants will put a strain on governments and people will starve. These are but a fraction of things to come should dramatic climate change occur. Comparing our climate to the climate Earth had millions of year ago does nothing for us, we have to think about what we have now and how climate change will affect that.

You can't, to follow your example, "remove pollutants from the oceans" without eliminating industries that rely on dumping pollutants in the oceans. Those people will have to be taken care of, obviously, but the way to do that isn't to prop up their jobs that are directly causing the problem.

I'm just unsure how you've arrived at the conclusion that climate change is only a political game It is scientific consensus at this point that human actions are warming the planet and that this warming will cause massive ecological damage. This is coming from the mouths of the scientists, whose jobs are literally to uncover true things about the nature of reality. Sure, climate science has become political, but political quabbling has no bearing on the reality of the situation. I don't give a damn for slimy Democrats either who have only their party's interests in mind. But in this specific case, they are very much right about something. You can support some things without supporting the whole agenda. That's how our country moves forward.

Our fossil fuels will never run out. New sources are being discovered all the time, just not all in the middle east. Even if one day we were to run out of fossil fuels, there would be no issue changing to renewables. Energy demand is massive constantly and people will innovate to meet it if the day ever comes(it wont). Also, our most reliable source of clean energy is nuclear, which the green new deal and its proponents are actively against. If we do ever run out of coal/oil/natural gas, nuclear will be the most likely substitute.

Also ignoring the effects a non-decision would have on the environment. I don't think anyone is under the impression that our fossil fuel are limitless. Shouldn't the government take steps to safeguard their own peoples future by investing in the solution and help push it forward. A lack of government action may result in potentially disastrous outcomes and for this argument I don't mean the environment (although it is the most pressing issue). Should we one day find our fossil fuel resources nearing depletion and when then now turn to the renewable energy sector what happens then? We will still see the dramatic shift from non-renewable to renewable as proposed by the Green New Deal, this shift is both slow and expensive and most importantly unprecedented. Who knows what complication may arise (look at Germany's current situation with their Energiewende). They have may great leaps toward renewable energy and yet there are many complications and coal is still needed to provide energy security to their citizens. If we delay too long what backups will there be, how much more will it cost if we do not start the process now? I am no fortune teller, nor am I an expert in economics, climate change nor politics but it should not be the norm for a government to act as a band-aid and work to mitigate or fix the problems that have arisen today. It is their job to safeguard the way of life and secure the future of the people they govern. Just as they invest in defence from foreign enemies, or education for the living standards of its citizens, or agriculture for continued food security. Why should it not invest in renewable energy for our energy security, to let us continue to have the luxury of using our electrical appliances and have debates over the internet. I'm sorry this is so long, if you don't read it I'm perfectly ok with that.	UCvlusmfbNSLkMa_zUaOMEgA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvlusmfbNSLkMa_zUaOMEgA	1	Ugy13UIS4mDFgSsIfbZ4AaABAg	Hanqing Sun

Besides, if the renewable energy companies can't create a product better than that which the fossil fuel companies offer, it's not governments job morally or technically to give taxpayer money to select businesses. If renewable energy companies can make a product that's better, they'll get the customers. If they can't, they shouldn't.

Millions of rich people at the top with no commodity to peddle, beef, coal, power plants, oil companies, auto manufacturers, parts manufacturers, etc. is a fight to the death to hold onto their investments. Billions will lose their jobs..who will pay taxes to the IRS to run an economy. The government wouldn&#39;t even be able to afford health care under a plan for all with so much money not going through the treasury. What will be the next job generation...solar panel, electric cars..health care ? Wind mill construction and installation ? Begin transitioning those jobs NOW. Land clearing for crops to feed communities due to eating local. What we are actually having to expect is to go back to the early pioneer days of existence with a few perks.

Not to mention while this process is being done China and India’s emissions are increasing which means we’ll probably have a less than 1 percent affect on the world’s carbon emissions. Here’s a thought, instead of tackling a problem we can’t fix, how about we tackle ones that we can domestically. Illegal immigration, crime, subsidized work. Let’s fix our house before we try to fix our world...	UCcYe3Mg7w5zvIS_4N_tVhYw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcYe3Mg7w5zvIS_4N_tVhYw	0

We just need to vote the right people in, and protest, strike, engage in peaceful civil disobedience until governments give in and finally do what's right rather than what's profitable.  Exxon and BP knew about climate change in the 20th century; they raised their oil rigs to compensate for sea level rise they knew would occur, but still continued funding groups that denied man-made climate change was even occurring.

The whole world also have to stop fossil fuel use (good bye Facebook and YouTube as the world rely on fossil fuel to make electricity). Only a few places use renewable sources for electricity. <br /><br />Even if all of North and South America stopped, it wouldn&#39;t even change the climate by a degree, because we are already one of the most environmentally conscious first world countries. So how do we get the rest of the world on board? Well The British Empire and the Roman Empire are the two most successful examples of getting the world to what you want.<br /><br />The Green New Deal, a prelude to the American Empire. am I wrong?

Geothermal can't be done anywhere because it requires specific geological conditions, wind whacks birds to death, solar obviously doesn't work at night and is weak during winters/at high latitudes. We can't just build dams willy nilly because of the ecological impact of changing the hydrogeology of entire areas. Fossil fuels need to have their subsidies cut but if there's any hope to make things green I don't think you can remove it from nuclear or the green alternatives as they get more research and development.

You can just change where your fuel is coming from. Instead of oil drilling, it will be oil manufacturing using carbon capture.<br /><br />Carbon capture produces an alcohol and water mixture which can then be turned into fuel, and apparently new advancements in this technology makes this process much more economical.<br /><br />This can also be used to fix the &quot;solar power problem&quot;, by generating fuel and then using it again later to generate power.<br /><br />With this technology a green future won&#39;t be a radically different and expensive future.

The disposal of solar panels will invariably lead to heavy metal leeching into ground water, and cause other ecological issues. But disposal isn&#39;t the only issue: solar panels require so much gasoline to produce that it takes over 5 years for them to become carbon neutral per panel, and then their life typically ends 5 years after that. But wait, there&#39;s more. Rare earth metals have to be mined in really ecologically damaging ways. Then you have wind. Yeah...does anyone really think wind is a great idea? The windmills take a huge amount of land, cause issues with regards to local wildlife, and then the transportation of the energy causes their efficiency to be effectively less than 20%. <br /><br /><br />Seriously, does nobody look at the actual production life-cycle of these &quot;green&quot; energy sources? It&#39;s really easy, and should be obvious. Solar panels don&#39;t just magically appear with no carbon footprint upstream. And they don&#39;t just magically disappear when they go out of service. This is literally the theory of permanence, you know, the same mental theory you all should have developed by the age of 2 (when something goes out of sight it doesn&#39;t disappear from existence).<br /><br />And what about the high speed rails the Green New Deal wants? That&#39;s not feasible for several reasons. <br />1. The amount of power that would be required for one high speed rail that extends from one coast to the other would be somewhere in the hundreds of megawatts. How will that be powered?<br />2. There are far more than just plains in between California and New York. There are several turns and curves that would be required to extend a railway between California and New York. That limits the speed, and makes a &quot;high speed&quot; railway less efficient.<br />3. Do you have any idea how much that would cost to build? How much do you think Highway 69 cost to build? Psst, it was about $4B. Well, imagine that times at least 10, and likely more. That&#39;s just the initial cost. Then there&#39;s maintenance cost which could be in the billions per year, depending on how the railway was built.<br />4. Talk to a Civil Engineer if you want more issues with this crazy idea.<br /><br />It&#39;s a ridiculous proposal. Please try again.

Also the reactors were built to withstand this current climate. As the permafrost melts and gaseous molecules propel upwards through the earth, there could be explosions, and that can certainly destabilize reactors. There are only so many precautions reactors have set in place. Nuclear is not the answer. My father and other workers all are exposed to this radiation no matter what small amount is emitted. Many are diagnosed with cancer. Nuclear is not the answer.	UCllpd8-3NfizhDRIjIwW52g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCllpd8-3NfizhDRIjIwW52g	0

UgzRQtjrB1XAbjX-p2J4AaABAg	3	20	2019-06-14 12:06:03	Eyurtaki	This resolution is a joke. Not only it mixes climate with social-economic and racial injustices (i suppose, the fact black people were oppressed has something to do with climate change...) but i doesn&#39;t offer a single solution. It only number, very broadly speaking, the key aspects of a law that the government is responsible to make... just because?<br />The House of Representatives and the Senate have as their main goal to pass laws. This &quot;resolution&quot; should have been the result of an academic committee suggesting the lawmakers to take action. But this, coming from the Law Making brunch of Government, is a joke. Seriously, green house emissions don&#39;t go down, because someone told them to. They go down by policy, outlining specific actions, that work towards this goal.<br /><br />We need X TWh of energy, which can be produced from Y solar panels, Z wind turbines and Ω nuclear factories. The government is hereby instructed to build said factories and fund the constructions of said solar panels and wind turbines.<br />That&#39;s what a policy is. Simple, specific instructions from someone, so someone else can follow them and the rest of us can evaluate if it&#39;s a job well done.

Maybe Thor Raiden or Zuis could be considered climate scientists, but we haven&#39;t experimented on Earth scientifically yet so they are merely climatologists. For any information on the science behind oceanic warming please refer to the chemists and physicists. Hmmm... Okay definitely no engineers in this, no immissions definitely doesn&#39;t mean no combustion engines which we need to power the generators to create alternating current to pump electric current through the power lines for long distances; you could simply collect the emissions. Again ask the chemists and engineers, we can do this, I mean literally we are able to do this now. These UN climate scientists, LMFAO, work for the biggest oil producing countries in the world, they don&#39;t want to stop selling oil, they want their competitors to stop selling oil. I hope we find a sufficient catalyst to convert grains and vegetable oil to clean sulfur free fuel so we can put big oil out of business. Than we can just send the rest of our oil reservoirs to Mars to create an atmosphere.	UCZamqCqNHdAhBFkBCfI0Svw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZamqCqNHdAhBFkBCfI0Svw	0

For instance, im a general labor who excepts that he cannot make money with out people with proper education. Just as the people with the education cannot make money with out general laborers. The issue here is why should educated people make more. A general laborer is equally as important as a educated person. Cannot have one with out the other. Correct that and transition maybe easier. Fyi, i understand that more education more bills. But more back breaking labor (literally 5 back surgeries) comes bills. So really all and education does is save your body.

Battery technology has significantly improved in recent years, reaching close to 90% efficiency in input vs output, but the waste that is generated as a byproduct of lithium battery production is a major environmental hazard in itself.

Big companies have vast sums of wealth and they invest some of that wealth into seeking further wealth at the detriment of others in the form of lobbying. For this particular case fossil fuel lobbyists are lobbying for the continued used of fossil fuels to further their bottom line at the cost of our planet and our children's future.

Many conservatives aren’t wrong about that, the government would have to take lots of control and dictate over many people’s lives but in the end something has to be done. The majority of the plan hasn’t been laid out yet but climate change is happening at a faster rate every year. Climate change has always been happening on some level but with the emission of so many green house gasses like CO2 it’s speed is gradually picking up.If we don’t make the change to a more sustainable system now we’ll be outta luck before we know it.

But seriously we should limit our emissions to under the 1.0 mark but also invest more into science. The most abundant and most important enzyme on earth is rubisco, found in plants, that can fix carbon. The only problem is that the enzyme is inefficient. When we look at earth right now, it’s slowly starting to resemble earth in its primitive days. How do we stop that from happening? We can solve it in a similar way that it was done back then. We can culture photosynthetic bacteria and we can also use science to speed up the action of Rubisco in plants, which is not being researched as much. Not only that, but we need to prepare for the future because irreversible damage has already happened. Don’t get me wrong I want to end climate change, but it’s estimated that the deal will cost $93 trill and will only get rid of emissions linked to the US, when what about the rest of the world. Also we would be put in a lot of debt but somehow she says we can raise minimum wage. This plan was created by someone who said the world is going to end in 12 years, someone who made up something in order for people to support her. I say execute a plan that limits the burning of fossil fuels by govt limitations. However also invest into science because this is not just an American problem, this is a worldwide problem.

Trust me, we are way past the days of Fukushima and Chernobyl. In fact, modern nuclear energy is one of the safest and most stable sources of energy. The only problem is that it costs tons of money to mine Uranium and create huge reactors, so scientists are now starting to expirement with a reactor called the TFSR, or the Thorium fluoride salt reactor which uses thorium as a source rather than uranium. It’s self sustaining, safe, and Leagues cheaper than uranium reactors. We just have to develop one on a big scale. *The future is actually bright in the fields of energy efficiency, so I would like to ask everyone to stop fearmongering for views.*	UC689OJNQ8N9YKq7FVTWr4mQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC689OJNQ8N9YKq7FVTWr4mQ	1	Ugx0rFrZaEy2P5PBYIB4AaABAg	Charles Lumia

Finding creative ways to reduce our environmental foot print is certainly ideal. My main issue with the idea is it's not just companies being wasteful although yes they are being exceptionally and needlessly wasteful. My point is more the demand for energy. The last remaining countries to make that transition into being a developed nation is nigh and this will skyrocket our need for energy. I think it is very important and even critical to reduce or consumption. However, this will not be enough to stop the damage we've done. We need better forms of energy and ways to reverse the what mass industrialization has done to our environment.

Meanwhile, we could also educate the whole population of richest countries to be aware of their energy consumption and try to reduce it. I mean, is restorative agriculture useful if people continue to buy off-season products or heavy-processed food and producing a lot of trash? Or is it useful to recycle our trash when big industries still create non-recyclable packaging (and people still buying it because that's part of their habits)? I understand that the more people there is, the more energy we need. And we can't cut on some comfort we have (like in medecine or communication), but I still think that the way we live in rich countries is, for the most part, a waste of energy and materials. So, is the prior thing to produce more energy or to re-think the way we live?

We are increasing in population and the more people there are the higher demand for energy. Asking people to cut back on energy is not a feasible solution when we simply need more and more energy through the coming decades. Our best bet is to choose cleaner sources of energy and sequester our emissions through restorative agriculture, afforesration and other methods that create a carbon sink.

Going green is taking too long, and being stifled by trade wars and U.S. politics continually derailing away from environmental activism. There will be no green progress in the U.S. until they stop their trade war with China. We can't wait for actors to finally get fusion energy or sustainable green energy. Nuclear is the middle ground for now, and you really are naive if you think otherwise. Yeah, it's not green, but when you look at the environmental damages that coal, oil, and natural gases are doing, it's looking pretty green in comparison. Finland is also currently building infrastructure to store the world's nuclear waste, and if other nations would do the same, their storage could be viable until we finally transition onto green. With regards to people doing the "Fukushima" or "Chernobyl" counter-arguments, please educate yourselves on how they happened, and what corruption went into ignoring the safety hazards which allowed these accidents to happen. Thorium molten salt reactors might be worth looking into more than only scratching the surface. Also, nuclear plants would have to be outside of economic competition, or else they would go down the same lobbyist route as the Fukushima disaster did.

As all but the poorest Germans could afford the switch to renewable energy, which is dependent on sun and wind, those who could not afford the switch still had to rely on traditional forms of energy production which for Germany is not mainly coal as they have phased out much of their nuclear power. As we all know the sun does not always shine nor does the wind always blow, meaning these sources of renewable energy cannot be ramped up or down to match demand. As a result Germany began to overproduce power as a precaution so as to not potentially end up with an energy deficit resulting in blackouts.

That's not even including the concrete needed to support such a structure that both releases a large amount of greenhouse gasses in its production and setting and can have impacts on the area around it. this further pushes back how long before it can be carbon neutral. Honestly its not hard to do a preliminary search for the well documented data displaying the energy/impact of many of these sources. Nuclear energy is actually very safe all things considered.

Solar is more expensive if you want to generate the same amount of energy comparing to a nuclear reactor. Also for 100 acre nuclear power plant, you would need thousands of acres of land to install solar panels. Plus enough lithium battery systems which would also need more mining, to hold energy during the night. Yeah there is nuclear waste but currently there is reactors that use waste as fuel or planning to. Such as the French’s uses that method. Plus 70 percent of their energy production is from nuclear energy. Solar takes more space, meaning more habitat destruction, decreased bird populations around the area, water supply tainted and polluted from deep earth mining, and yet you get small amounts of energy.

Most likely because there is no intelligent argument against nuclear that goes further than that. The technology used in chernobyl was 80s soviet tech. Nuclear technology has moved well beyond that, it's like comparing a ford model t to a bentley. As for fukushima, of couse putting a nuclear core near a seismic fault line has inherent risk, but most of the world doesnt live in an earthquake zone. Let's remember france, and the UK have had nuclear for decades with no issues. Fukushima was caused after an earthquake AND a tsunami. For nearly every country in the world, those are not risks to worry about	UCnCODoz_U5e5sy_FFcQYpsA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnCODoz_U5e5sy_FFcQYpsA	1	Ugx0rFrZaEy2P5PBYIB4AaABAg	Charles Lumia

Half the scientists produce proof of one thing while half produce proof of the other. One group produces what they discovered using scientific methods. The other group produces what they are paid to produce. But the paid side does such a good job of making it look legit, that you basically have to pick a side by faith. Although in the case of climate change, the doom side has made many predictions they guaranteed would come true, that all failed to come true. They also have collected a lot of income from spreading the fear. So for this particular science, it is a little easier to see which side is which.

The list is endless,at any given moment somewhere on the planet someone is burning something or discharging something. Be it slash and burn farming or a million farting cows! We have unwittingly, through sheer numbers terraformed our atmosphere in just a 100 years and now lack the know how to revert those changes.

Everything breaks down. Steel Mills aren&#39;t exactly green. As long as spare parts and replacement rails are need. Steel Mills and factories etc are needed. I have been in the manufacturing industry for 13 years. Not long. BUT I have made alot of product for wind power and locomotives. Companies like pangea, GE, electromotive all order replacement parts. Cnc Mills and lathes need fossil fuels to maintain efficiency. Hydraulics also need fossil fuels.	UCWaF-CW66KVYqE1zl2NXrvA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWaF-CW66KVYqE1zl2NXrvA	0

We are so lucky to have such a chemical concoction that can keep planes off of enemy radar and by all means we should not look into the environmental and health risks that comes with the chemicals that are raining down upon us. There are so many issues that are collectively causing climate change, I could HAARP about it until the farting cows come home. I truly am conCERNed about it but if I&#39;m going to implode with the planet in twelve years then I&#39;m going to run up some credit cards and buy me some ocean front property that I can still get on a thirty year mortgage on. 🤔	UCiLweUnmBc9Mp0JCaTvlNUw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiLweUnmBc9Mp0JCaTvlNUw	0

Not to mention all of the hazardous mining in order to create batteries and the dangerous disposal of batteries. All of these are done with massive gas-guzzling machines. With electric cars, they require coal and natural gas to provide the electricity needed to run it. However the actual zero emission energy source is at the same time the big bad N word of enegy sources. I&#39;ll give you a hint it make up 75% of France&#39;s energy and as a result, they pay the lowest electricity rates in Europe and makes france the world&#39;s largest net exporter of electricity. Meanwhile in Vermont, they got rid of their one plant and carbon emissions went up.	UCfiW1XMyzHBH0ztysWOTKmg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfiW1XMyzHBH0ztysWOTKmg	0

That’s exactly what will happen if we go forward with a plan that zealots are unwilling to recognize the flaws in and are going to pour al resources in maintaining the image of, including the image of the state in a rash transition period.

As you said these countries are developing, where can they get these highly-demanding energy rapidly: burning fossil fuels. Also, their government are currently building more solar and nuclear plants to reduce their reliance on fossil fuel power plants in the near future. They also building high-speed railways to reduce the carbon emission by aeroplanes. Meanwhile, the US is now already a developed country, a global powerhouse but like to spend its money on military and walls, increase the tariff on developing countries to threaten them and pretend to be the boss of the Earth, rather than building high-speed railways and reduce the usage of cars and aeroplanes, helping other countries developing their infrastructures.

Unlike AOC who’s Green New Deal will destroy the US economy, spend trillions of trillions of dollars while we are already trillions of dollars in debt. Retrofit EVERY Building in America in a ten year period which is next to impossible. And after all of these initiatives are finished guess what? The US only contributes 15% of Carbon Emissions which makes the whole impact of this practically worthless as it forfeits our position as the worlds best economy to China, puts us in extreme massive debt which will take decades and centuries to pay off, and it won’t have much of an Impact as China is leading the US almost double in Carbon Output. They will not destroy their entire economy to “save” the environment and put them and their security at risk	UC4pYWAfiX6It8TkxGPL320Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4pYWAfiX6It8TkxGPL320Q	1	UgxtFUCqz9vK1EwPI9Z4AaABAg	Koay J-Shenn

If young people are in office with socialist egalitarian ideas, what would they even do to stop climate change? Unless we are now going to stop using stoves to heat up our food and use sticks and flint to light up heat, or use bicycles to commute..... but even then do you really think people would do all these things? Why is it that America decreased its carbon emissions more than any other country, but it’s the capitalists to blame when developing countries like India China and Vietnam can pump out increasing numbers of carbon emissions without consequence?

This is a one size fits all approach that does not work for areas with rural agricultural communities. Notice that all the legislators against the Green New Deal are all from states with large rural agricultural communities. Without the rural states&#39; buy-in, this plan becomes fodder against urban elitists. If I have to drive 70 miles to buy groceries or watch a movie, why in the world am I going to take away the very mode of transportation that makes that possible? Locally grown food is a good idea, but how much food does a major metropolitan area consume and how much arable land is close by a city? The Green New Deal is a good first step, but it is an ultimate fail because the Green New Deal only considers major urban centers.

I totally understand if you or your family works in these industries that give off admissions. But if not, you should be for this deal. <br /><br />This is just a first step. It’s gonna be hard to go to zero admissions but we need to try. Not trying at all would be sad. Even if we aren’t on track, the harder we try and quicker we can get this done, the better off our planet could be.<br /><br />Also consider the economics. People say this will destroy the economy but what about the trillions of dollars that will be needed from all these natural disasters that will arise within the next century.<br /><br />I know this isn’t a super intellectual argument because I’m not an expert in these topics but any average person should understand this reasoning and agree.

As in nothing. How does anyone expect to convince even a single country&#39;s military to stop using jet fuel, stop using helicopter fuel, stop using anything but electric and nuclear powered vehicles of any kind? Especially when other countries are not giving this up.<br />Arguments of pro-military or anti-military aside, is it even in the realm of faint possibility to expect the U.S. Military, the largest on the planet, to give up this resource when it&#39;s rivels won&#39;t?<br />Maybe their portion of fossil fuel use is tiny (sort of doubt it), but I know it&#39;s definitely not zero. So where does zero fossil fuel use factor into a world where (almost) every country uses these fuels for defense? And why isn&#39;t that being talked about?

Also the one thing that wasn`t talked about it the amount of carbon generated by our current electricity grid, what`s the plan there? If we eliminate individual carbon foot prints but just turn around and increase the energy foot print do we really win? I fully agree with moving to greener energy, but they have to be realistic we can`t go from where we`re at to 0 in a few years...

The populations of India and China alone dwarf our population. They have very different concerns and goals and underlying beliefs. If we do this alone and let’s say we succeed somehow, we will be at an extreme cost disadvantage to international trade and productivity compared to those nations who can deliver cheaply while they wreck the earths climate and that isn’t really addressed adequately. It assumes our products and services will be competitive in the world which they may not be and it assumes cheap imports which they may not be.

Also the major benefits of thorium are found specifically in a LFTR. We have actually used thorium cores in the USA in the past at Shippingport (1977) and Fort Vrain (1984), but these reactors were LWBR. In both of these reactors the benefits were not high enough to justify the increased cost of production.

And the one in Hinkley Point, UK is even going to costs more. So it is true: Nuclear power ist the only power which got more expensive, while renewables are falling to a large percentage every year.

Building new nuclear power plant takes around 12-15 years. In that time renewables also keep getting cheaper. 3. Nuclear power ist the only power source which got more expensive over time. Meanwhile Solar has fallen 34% in price in the last year alone. 4. More and more companies are moving away from nuclear power because of the cost. Look at Hitachi and Toshiba in the UK.

The carbon dioxide level jumped from 300 ppm to over 3000 ppm, happening in 60000 years. The amount that we are releasing upsets the current natural balance that is there. We are contributing to a rough increase of 1 ppm per year, which is much greater than the rate observed during the Permian extinction. Why shouldn't we be worried?

Which countries are actually doing the damage ? And by the amount. It’s not even the big things , the small things we have such as plastic containers, bags, etc. Use glass containers and if we have waste put it in our soil (like food). But we have so many chemicals so how will it work.	UC7KaggMHeIUl9bhUq7vm1dA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7KaggMHeIUl9bhUq7vm1dA	0

Get India and China, who make up over 55% of pollution to cut emissions, to cut emissions. Also ask the countries that joined the Paris Accords to actually start lowering emissions since they are increasing emissions at a higher percentage than all other countries.

Think about all the push back the US is getting, that&#39;s going to happen to every single other country as well. Zero emissions means that every single country needs to participate, I doubt my country is even going to embrace it. <br /><br /><br />We need to stop thinking about how to stop global warming, our generation is past that point of being able to conduct preventative action. We need to start thinking about how to live in a world with weather uncertainty. We need to build resilient infrastructure to combat floods and generate enough energy that a sudden heatwaves can be mitigated through air conditioning. We need to switch our diets to rely less on animals but rather foods that will not be reliant on the production of other foods. <br /><br /><br />Its naive to think that 14 pieces of paper can stop a rock slide, if we want any shot of preventing global warming, its going to involve an ACTUAL takeover of governments and corporations. <br /><br /><br />Thats not going to happen.

Whatever you try to build to protect yourself will not only 1. cost more than preventative measures 2. require indefinite upkeep and repair 3. fail to protect forms of travel through massive ice and snow storms and 4. will never be able to keep up with the rate at which climate will change. You simply can't protect farmlands, city areas, water sources, rural areas and any coastlines from BOTH temperature increase and decrease due to climate change. You would have to make giant invincible domes to cover ALL of those areas and have pathways to transport food to all areas. You would also have to make sure that these closed off areas are zero emission, or else you will have the EXACT same problem on a smaller scale much faster. If anything, your ridicule of the only attempt at educating everyone on the state of our climate (The Green New Deal) is naive and ignorant.

To just call it "the weather" too, really undermines the repercussions of global warming. Also, the difficulty in this situation is the fact that we don't know what exactly is going to happen and to what degree if we do pass this +2.0 degree celsius threshold, which is why its so important to try and actively do something about it right now, rather than spending more money trying to protect ourselves over something we could've avoided. That to me, is more naive and creates more issues later on.	UCqg8W-1xUycGsT9L8E3ilTQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqg8W-1xUycGsT9L8E3ilTQ	1	Ugz4PDsdVewpt04oMqF4AaABAg	Thomas Shih

He added several regulations to your fossil fuel industry, that ensures that they do not pollute excessively. Something which Trump has been pulling back since his time in office. Also, I remember when Republicans fought and successfully killed the Cap and Trade Bill from yhe Obama administration which would have regulated your Carbon emissions very well.

The government has 3 jobs, to protect life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That means it's the government's job to make sure nobody can force you to do anything, and to give you the freedom to do whatever you want (as long as it does not take away the rights of another individual). It is not the job of the government to redistribute wealth.	UCVdYsXx6HzBoj7it8Xs6RKQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVdYsXx6HzBoj7it8Xs6RKQ	1	UgztNd1zc0oRgolggxJ4AaABAg	Mild To Moderate Cancer

But the government has the right to tax them, and taxes are used not for individual gain, but to fund vital services and infrastructure. The wealthy Americans have enough money that taxes will still not have a major impact on their incomes, while providing funding to vital services in the US. The purpose of taxes is to help the lives of everyone. There is a massive amount of wealth inequality in the US. I believe there needs to be higher taxes on wealthy Americans because of this.

However agriculturally it is still a disaster for another reason, the same area is mostly a mountainous craggy landskape with hardly any infrastructure to speak of (as much of russia is) so the argument still stands correct for those reasons.

The Republican Party is in an awkward position in which most Americans, and most of their own party accept that global warming is happening and yet there is very little work being done to create a real response to the Green New Deal. Republicans should be focusing on free-market approaches (data sharing platforms for companies to share sustainability practices and data, encouraging investment in American recycling processes and infrastructure, working with automakers to streamline EV regulations, open up federal land to lithium sampling and mining, etc.) to dealing with climate change rather than just acting as a bulwark against change. One thing that people often fail to realize is that there are two serious economic crises on the horizon, global warming and historically high debt to GDP in the US and other developed nations. Both have the capability of creating economic catastrophe and throwing the entire world economy into a tailspin. We need to address both and the current GOP leadership, starting with the president himself does not want to touch either.

There's a lot he could've of done and a lot he never was able to follow through with but let's just say Bush went little nuts (ended as a very unpopular two-term president) and Obama didn't know quite how to approach the situation. He was able to correct some of Bush's mistakes but didn't do much to solve issues.

Their answer to mitigate the cost is to give power to government entities to solve the problem of job loss. Chaos and instability is also a possibility in our future if we implement these sudden changes. Have we thought of what that would cost us? How can we save the Earth if we don't find a plan that balances short term costs with long term stability.

We don&#39;t have electric airplanes - All of our air travel would have to immediately stop. We don&#39;t have electric cargo ships - International shipping and trade would have to stop. This is not realistically possible. It&#39;s a hopeless fantasy to think that we could remove all of our fossil fuel use just like that.<br /><br /><br />Instead of this ridiculous plan, we need to develop strategies to reduce our fossil fuel consumption as soon as is REALISTICALLY possible. It is imperative to do so. Otherwise, we&#39;re just wasting time with proposing this pointless impossible fantasy.

The only thing holding us back is greed and selfishness. it is 100% possible to replace. Batteries the sizes of factories to store the wind and solar energy that is lost when it isn't instantly used. Nuclear power to act as a stepping stone until Hydrogen fuel cells are perfected. Hydrogen power offers the next greatest energy density of any other power source ONLY second to nuclear power. And you make one very important point. Besides trains and cars, how do we replace air and large shipping boats? Shipping boats are more easily converted to hydrogen power, as size and weight are not as big of an issue. Hydrogen power requires a source of hydrogen. Many people think hydrogen gas is the only way to store it. This is not correct. Intercalation (same process that happens with lithium ions in batteries) is a far safer and more adaptable way to store hydrogen to be used in planes and other forms of transport.

I can&#39;t be called a denier because the climate is changing I&#39;ve just yet to see any evidence that says we did it. The climate changing in this way has happened many times over the life of the planet. Alot of the science I&#39;ve heard and seen says this is and was going to happen with or without humans so someone give me that missing Link that says we are the sole reason this is happening to the planet! And also understand this, One single super eruption from one of the dozens of large caldera volcanoes on Earth WILL and I mean WILL because just like climate change these super eruptions are also inevitable meaning they WILL happen again. That event alone has in the past and WILL again in the future omit more carbon into the atmosphere then human beings could ever omit in millions of years on Earth. And that&#39;s nature instantly changing the climate without us, all on its own. I&#39;ll say it again 1 super eruption will put more carbon in the atmosphere then humans can do over millions of years. So please one more time tell me how we are the cause it and how us stopping everything we do could possibly ever prevent it? And good luck with this save the Earth by spending lots of money on my project &quot;green bill&quot; of yours there guys.

The better way to go is to not have any government control, just government specifications that need to be followed. So if its coal then it needs to be at the highest standard of environmental controls, same with oil, gas and nuclear. They need to be on par with Hydro, solar and wind in terms of minimal damage to the environment. So every type of energy production needs to be high quality and live up to a high standard but every type of energy is welcome on the grid. Electricity needs to be offered in more of a free market way where many producers can feed in and power is more valuable at peak times. The free market will allow the best energy source to win. The military industrial complex will need to stop supporting only one energy source though, the way it supports oil. No more government subsidies for nuclear, oil or any other type. I feel quite certain that if all subsidies were removed, we would find the cheapest energy over its life cycle is a mix of geothermal, wind, solar and Hydro dams as a backup for peak loads	UCYUQBu3Ef5qgWksKOA0iPjg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYUQBu3Ef5qgWksKOA0iPjg	1	Ugwk5d7sNaLbVVRsZzp4AaABAg	Sebastian Turner

And the USA government is friends with Saudis so they won't go against them for the sake of a powerless state like Sudan. Sad but unfortunately true.

The political tid-bits that are written in, namely doing away with the electoral college, should be proof enough for anyone that there’ is evil intent involved. Do away with the EC and you turn everything between NY and CA into vassal states and turns the citizens in those states into slaves. Though I have no issue with taking positive action for the environment, I do things to that end daily, I will not bow to any mandate to do so. If through some fluke any of this were to become actually policy, we will certainly see armed rebellion and resistance. No one is going to come into my home or onto my land and force any changes.

UgxFPyiKpgCRS3Uk6Vl4AaABAg	0	1	2019-06-13 06:49:48	Sudarshan Pujari	This video tells us just why the green new deal failed. Part 1 was spot on, in fact repeating the . It was part two which was political ergo polarising. One cannot force but build consensus, like any movement in history anywhere on globe. One cant skip steps. GND actually did more damage to green movement than good. It turned a good chunk of opinion hostile. Plus the last part of the video says, it actually accomplishes nothing but merely acknowledged the issues (which no one needs as the EPA and others exist, one might be better off if they go for public education on climate change and make them understand why of the issue to build support). Thus making tall promises without means to fulfill them is bogus. China is a master here. It is building its green capacity on the back of fossil fuels to make the switch. GND turns it onto its head and splits the two which is basically non viable. <br />In short without a plan of action this was bound to fail. Had it been two separate Bill&#39;s, there was bound to be some consensus on part one while part 2 debate could have been national conversation. Now a good chunk of opinion is turned hostile and this is disastrous.<br />I hope I am able to drive the point home.

Instead of simply legislating on climate change, it also tries to pass a ton of other legislation (a job guarantee, single payer) which people who agree with the former goal might not agree with. The goal is to solve climate change, not to tack on a bunch of progressive policy proposals and say &quot;We have to take drastic action&quot; if anyone opposes it.<br /><br /><br />It shouldn&#39;t be a package. It should be something easy to pass that the majority of Democrats and perhaps a few Republicans can agree on, not every single policy proposal Progressives want to ram through	UC97cNDjNK6eihjCIBIs8eGw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC97cNDjNK6eihjCIBIs8eGw	0

We are severely lacking in building of nuclear plants. Lets build so many that all the coal and gas ones can be turned off. They are a much better ROI than solar or wind.

To rely in the state to operate such a change is indeed a joke, such a process would only be a decoy to distribute money to bureaucrats and their entourage. The state is sluggish and riddled with unnecessary bureaucracy, it premiums unproductive behavior and foster the enrichment of politicians and their cohorts. Presidents and kings are all one and the same, democracy is just an absolute oligarchy with a softer make-up.<br /><br />Any change we want has to start with our very own sweat and hard work. If this trend that defines demanding the state is all the civic life we need to actually grow as society, the old dragon that Hobbes called leviathan will eat us alive and burn with our planet.

They both destroy 5 mailboxes ok their own free will. Each is responsible for the destruction of 5 mailboxes. Johnny decidea to pay Billy to destroy 3 mailboxes for him, and continues to destroy 2. On paper Billy destroyed 8 and Johnny destroyed 2. So we can claim Johnny has made improvements. But Billy is only destroying 5 for himself and 3 for Johnny. Had Johnny actually made an improvement instead of 10 mailboxes being destroyed only 7 would be. This is a way to offset responsibility by having another party take responsibility for the action.

The issue is the wall between policy and science. China is the largest emitter, but they're basically going through an industrial revolution at the moment. The U.S. is the second, and repealing environmental regulations like the govt has done will only make it worse. We have the technology and money to start converting most if not all of our energy into renewable/nuclear, but our government doesn't. It's very important to elect people into office who will work towards a goal of switching our energy sources. Rep. Gabbard put forward the OFF act which SHOULD be the first step the U.S. should take. I see your point of complaining, then being complacent, because it kind of defeats the purpose of activism, but we live in a 21st century world where 21st century technology has a grip on society. Giving that up makes life very hard, if not impossible for most people. The U.S. has TRILLIONS of dollars that it puts out yearly towards its military budget (typically for wasteful regime change wars) when we could be switching our energy sources.

They want to address all the wrongs of the past, the present and future. In short, utopianism, communism. The Earth's climate has been changing for 100,000 yrs. Check ice cores. Also, the Earth is losing its magnetic field, so "ripping out carbon" isn't going to fix that and we are starting a grand solar minimum which means less solar activity and heat. The fact that anthropomorphic climate change proponents are screaming about a 12 yr deadline proves they are not being truthful, because no scientist would ever give out such a precise answer on climate predictions. And is the rest of the world going to go along with this? No, they aren't. GND is madness cooked up by NWO forces intent on impoverishing and controlling the West so they can move the centers of wealth production to Asia.

The results: a very small fraction of a percent would decrease the temperature. Go talk to Russia, China and India to stop them from using gas, coal, fossil fuels. America has actually been reducing the amount of CO2 emissions and it’s at an all time low because of Trump. So the green new deal will not work and will never pass even Democratic politicians hate it.	UCtg2yGQ-Km4QkbZn4Or785g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtg2yGQ-Km4QkbZn4Or785g	0

My point is that there’s all this buzz and motivation to stop using internal combustion ASAP but I rarely ever see livestock pollution articles or videos. Internal combustion pollution articles or videos are plentiful. The media always tries to make car engines look so bad but modern engines barely use any fuel. They’re so efficient now. The 15 biggest ships in the world cause more pollution than all the cars in the world. They use internal combustion but the reason they emit so much pollution is because they use bunker fuel. Gasoline engines are many times more clean. Edit:typo	UCHSUR-rAzY9V6bQ1xAjMNNA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHSUR-rAzY9V6bQ1xAjMNNA	1	UgxU9otIYsu_jHQClU54AaABAg	Bunda Maker

I mostly just hear “solar, wind or water” but the problem with this deal is that all these electrical devices have batteries. Batteries have horrible chemicals like manganese , cobalt& lithium, that we have to dig up and that leak into the waters (meaning when they are thrown away they leak nasty checmicals & it’s extremely hard to recycle everything). But I agree we should be leading the way. We can lose 6$ trillion dollars, spend billions on pointless wars but cant fund healthcare, space/ocean exploration and education properly.

Can't meltdown or explode like current reactors. Produce 1/5th the waste as conventional reactors and the waste only has to be shelved for 2-300 years tops before it's safe. Molten Salt Reactors can even consume the waste of older generation reactors and recycle it.

Try to get people to stick their heads in the sand and pretend that if the US changes while China, India, etc. do not, the planet is going to be well-off regardless? This doesn&#39;t even seem to make sense.People should spend their time and energy trying to convince other countries that are actually creating most of the emissions to cut down on their emissions if they care about this issue. And who knows if that is even remotely feasible or even moral, considering that then people, likely impoverished people in other countries, will then lose THEIR jobs? So far this is not coming across as well-thought out to me.	UCRNNWsG4Z736NcJWG1et59g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRNNWsG4Z736NcJWG1et59g	0

Sorry, you got me off on a tangent. ;-) Carbon capture is going to have to happen. We have to pull as much of the CO2 out of the atmosphere as we can. If that means we build atmospheric CO2 scrubbers that float in the air, so be it. We need to get CO2 back to about 280 ppm or so. Wind turbines are going to have to be taken down. Solar and hydro will be supplemental sources of energy. Don't know much about biobatteries.

I mean will the give people cars? Not likely. Will people want to buy a new car when it took so much trouble to pay off the one they have an it works? Also if there&#39;s a need for some thing (fossil fuel) there will be people that fill that need. This transition should have started decades ago it will probably take a while. Its just too big of a problem to solve all at once. What they need to break it down and start somewhere.	UCsdZPHD3il0rX1nf7JQz92g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsdZPHD3il0rX1nf7JQz92g	0

If they couldn’t be believed then, why listen now. They have been crying wolf for 40+ years to push an agenda and catastrophic results of choosing to not follow that agenda are promised to manifest decades in the future. If you truly believe all of this theory, disconnect the power to your house, cancel your internet, cancel your cell phone, sell your car, and live the life style you are promoting. People are far more likely to take you serious if you practice what you preach. But, that’s just my opinion, if you agree with it, great. If you disagree with it, great.

Shut down all coal and natural gas power plants. Tear down all wind turbines. Use solar and hydro as supplemental energy sources where it is warranted. The natural progression for cars from there is to go electric, and once people realize that they can charge their car overnight for $5-$10 vs filling up their gas tank for $50-$75 a tank, they'll move to electric cars further shrinking our reliance on fossil fuels. That's it, that's all we need to do.	UCfgnvY8bNlFUN2sXvhNehyg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfgnvY8bNlFUN2sXvhNehyg	1	UgyOHydJW9AKHIrI8i94AaABAg	Brant Pickard

I don't know if she changed it since that letter came out to say we had 12 years to do something on policy, before the storms get worse than the normal. That's why she said the Green New Deal was so vague. I would rather work with places like Detroit, than have a carbon tax. Which could hurt the poor working class. I would just ban 100% gas cars by whatever year coming out of the factory. They can make the same model car, but it has to be hybrid. Til they can keep up with Tesla on the range and cost of a new car, etc. Once they can, then you ban the hybrids coming out of the factory. This is what FDR meant by sacrificing on the home front and making the tanks instead of the cars. I would call that Social Democracy, not Democratic Socialism. Like some would portray it to be.

I work with a research group and we are actually currently exploring electrolytes and electrode materials that use much more common elements. Namely sodium rather than lithium. Hydrogen would have to be produced via electrolysis like you mentioned and then store for later use. The hope would be that energy sources such as wind, solar and ocean/sea tides would be used for this purpose. It solves a lot of problems that electric vehicles face. The biggest problem is “fast charging”. It is extremely damaging to the battery to fast charge and lowers the overall capacity in the long-run. Ultimately more research has to be done, but we really do need to switch to something in the mean time, I would say nuclear energy as it can produce the massive amounts of electricity that the power grid demands. Thorium reactors aren’t 100% understood yet, more like 80% but take advantage of thorium which is five times more abundant than uranium and doesn’t produce the same terrible by-products. They are called LFTR’s in case you want to look them up.	UCntqLNJMtQgt4Ct-psIPdfg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCntqLNJMtQgt4Ct-psIPdfg	1	Ugx4WoOeFBpoUTRz3Qd4AaABAg	JazzKetchupIV

Batteries the size of factories would need tremendous amounts of rather unpleasant materials and chemicals, many of which are expensive and hard to get in any quantity. Second hydrogen is not an energy source. Currently we have two ways of getting hydrogen, the most common is to refine it out of natural gas, the second is to use electricity to get it from water. Both methods require more energy to produce the hydrogen then we get from burning it.

Two: What do you do if countries in the developing world refuse to adapt in time. Because even now those countries account for most of the world&#39;s emissions. That these technologies as they are now are not as competitive as gas and other emissions-producing products. That with this deal costing so much and putting this country into so much more debt that is economy could not be competitive and be ruined.

As a Canadian, I can&#39;t help but think there are a lot of steps to go though, that really should have happened by now, that will have to happen long before this can.

Money isn&#39;t evil, but it can make someone evil. In essences, it&#39;s kinda pointless, it just makes things more convenient but you can build and make things without money.

This can be realized with hugely expanded carbon capture, no need to demolish our existing energy infrastructure to reach these goals.

Ugxzukkn2rDUq0WteAl4AaABAg.8w6-P-1R4s78w85nC6YsLo		0	2019-06-13 21:45:27	Andrew Williams	I agree that it's going to take more than JUST carbon capture, I'm mostly trying to point out that the video specifically mentioned 0 fossil fuels which I think is even more unrealistic than building enough carbon capture to reach carbon neutral. Focusing on increasing carbon capture capacity would buy us some time while we build and develop feasible alternatives to energy storage - the problem isn't so much energy production at this point, it's storing enough of it during off peak production hours, as well as finding alternatives to hydrocarbons in plastics and other materials that support our daily lives. It's going to be near impossible to eliminate our dependence on fossil fuels, especially in the relatively short amount of time the Green New Deal calls for, so we need be focusing on the right things, like figuring out how we can still have fossil fuels as part of our energy and materials landscape while continuing to reduce emissions and eventually reach the "net zero" condition that is really important.

But we have enough resources to go around, but we are spending it on negative returns. We are spending money on things that cost us more money to solve:<br />-We waste money buying big cars that make us look cooler than we are. In my country, New Zealand, our biggest selling new car is a Utility vehicle (pickup truck, Ford Ranger). And many people who don&#39;t really need it are buying it...then complaining about the cost of petrol. Pickup trucks, diamonds and bottled water: 3 of the biggest wastes of money that we just DGAF.<br />-we spend way too much money on holidays and travel because we believe that it will bring us self-actualisation; that it will transform us as people or make our lives more interesting. Flying planes is horrendous for the environment, plus it&#39;s a huge expense. Engage with your family and community, learn a new skill. If you can&#39;t find fulfillment in your own life, constant international trips isn&#39;t going to do it for you.<br />-we spend way too much on unhealthy food that requires healthcare to solve. A lot of diabetes and heart attacks are preventable, but we are the cause. We are spending money on food that kills us and requires more money to heal us.<br /><br />We have the resources to take care of all around us. It requires boldness to say that you don&#39;t want a superficial life that is robbing you of your wealth and health.

What about some of the other major countries that are so technologically behind the curve: China, India, the Middle East; just a few that come to mind that are producing just as much C02 and then some. Is the US supposed to step in and control this issue globally? I was in the military and went to combat in Afghanistan; there are many problems with poor efficiency vehicles by the thousands in that country alone, using outdated fossil fuel engines and equipment to get work done, and so forth. The United States isn’t the leader of this problem there are other areas that need to be addressed before running the country into the ground over this Green New Deal.

Stop the wars , $7 trillion spent from Iraq and other wars we could stop to save trillions in the future. Make corporations and billionaires pay their share in taxes . Amazon paid $0 legally in taxes last year and so did many other companies . Wealth taxes, marginal tax rates, and maybe estate taxes. We just gave away a trillion dollars in tax cuts that went to the wealthy . There are so many ways to pay for it but it won’t be enough . That’s why it’s named after the new deal because it is an emergency that the government needs to do so that the world can survive . We still would pay even if we don’t do the green new deal because the green new deal is a prevention resolution if we do nothing we have to pay a reactionary resolution which would cost even more . You don’t wait years to go to the doctor to find cancer you go every year and eat healthy to prevent it instead of doing nothing .

There was a previous plan to move the spent fuel, but people who lived near its planned destination objected, and I don't blame them. We can't just put our waste in other people's backyards! And the costs to move and store the waste is also massive, plus it takes fuel to move them! Yes, there are challenges with all types of energy production. But the difference is that nuclear energy production has catastrophic risks. There's never been a Chernobyl or Fukishima scale event with wind or solar. And when big problems happen, they can't be corrected in a matter of years, they take decades or longer (if you're lucky). Solar energy can be stored with batteries to account for peak energy use after sunset. There are new, bird-safe designs for wind energy that also reduce noise pollution. Using biomass, especially from toxic wastewater sludge that we don't want to go back into the environment is also another mostly untapped source of energy. Look up how much energy a conventional wastewater plant uses as a percentage of municipal load. There's enough energy in sludge to power the entire plant plus create surplus energy. That's a very big potential impact.	UCpbYb8RPg3SN03nM3iRRIqg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpbYb8RPg3SN03nM3iRRIqg	1	UgwSLm-jNZU3y_ImS5t4AaABAg	justice nwade

It is far safer, vastly more efficient, and produces less radioactive waste. unfortunately, the US gov't and Canadian gov't have bills that stop Thorium plants from being researched or made greater than ~1MW of power.

Building new nuclear power plant takes around 12-15 years. In that time renewables also keep getting cheaper. 3. Nuclear power ist the only power source which got more expensive over time. Meanwhile Solar has fallen 34% in price in the last year alone. 4. More and more companies are moving away from nuclear power because of the cost. Look at Hitachi and Toshiba in the UK.

But with our current resources, it is extremely difficult to make a direct jump to solar and wind power plants (not hydro, because honestly, they cause tremendous damage to the environment) and as a result, nuclear fission is an ideal transitory fuel. I agree Nuclear fusion would be a major breakthrough, but we cannot just wait to find a way to sustain such reactions and by the time we do know how to, it might be too late. I'm not advocating for Nuclear fission as a permanent alternative but rather as a transitory fuel from fossil fuels to completely green sources because at the end of the day, whatever it costs, it still is way more sustainable than fossil-based fuels.

Given, it's not as green and safe as wind or solar, but it's substantially less wasteful than coal or oil and produces an enormous amount of energy literally whenever we want it. Green energy is awesome and we should produce and use as much as possible but electricity cannot be moved an infinite distance and there will be days where conditions are unsuitable for generating green energy (cloudy, windless, etc.). We don't have a sufficient power storage solution to remedy that so we need a backup source.

Commercial nuclear power, even in its current form, is a mature technology. It's literally the safest way to produce power, and it's tied with wind for the cleanest. The amount of energy required to mine, refine, and enrich the fuel pails in comparison to the energy that is released through fission in the core. A single fuel assembly weighing one ton can power about 10,000 homes for roughly 4.5 years. The energy density is incredible. All of the energy needs for your entire life can be provided by a mass of low-enriched uranium about the size of a can of soda. Because the waste products are sealed in a zirconium cladding, they never leave the fuel. Guess what that means? The waste you produce also occupies a volume the size of a can of soda. Of all forms of energy, nuclear is the only one that accounts for every gram of waste it produces. No other form of energy, whether it be coal, natural gas, oil, solar, wind, or hydro can make that claim. They all produce harmful waste, that waste just goes up into the air or dissolves into our water supply unnoticed. As for nuclear fusion, calling it a "huge breakthrough" is a major understatement. There's a joke in the nuclear engineering department at my school, "The rule of thumb with commercial nuclear fusion is that it's always 50 years out." The fundamental problem scientists are facing with fusion is that more energy is required to magnetically contain the plasma than can be extracted from the plasma its self. The professor within the nuclear engineering department at my university that specialized in plasmas doesn't believe that commercial fusion is possible. That may or may not pan out to be true, but there are some serious technological hurdles that must be overcome if we ever hope to produce power on a large scale from nuclear fusion. You have to be ready to accept the fact that you and I may be dead by the time fusion powers anyone's car or home.

Mind the fact that due to a mix of regulations and lack (or inefficient) government intervention certain nations just lead to the lack of funding for nuclear power. Fusion would be a good goal to have, but from a current standpoint, we can no longer rely on waiting for research to push out a break-even as time is ticking. Nuclear energy has had a severe amount of stigma surrounding it, some fears founded with evidence that are addressed, but others are almost plain and deliberate misinformation, thus creating a perception of an ultra-toxic and dangerous cloud of unknowable technology consolidated by the few.

One of the methods of mining and refining Nuclear fuel (such as Thorium, Uranium and Plutonium) only really require electricity to both do and get materials. And each kg of Uranium fuel roughly equals 400 tons of Coal, and Thorium-Plutonium can equate to 2000 tons. It is still vastly superior. And nuclear waste can be stored underground in huge vaults, and the only real issue is how to warn future humans to avoid the storage facilities.

Shell has begun building hydrogen fuel stations and automakers like Ford, Toyota, and GM have begun building plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles years ago. Ford is currently not selling any EV's, but they will be making the Mach E soon. All of this means that even though we will likely drastically reduce our fossil fuel usage within our lifetimes, these companies will simply diversify their products and keep many of their jobs intact.

Do these people know how electric is even created? You&#39;d have to burn a massive amount of coal and burn every tree down to power every car in America. I am a civil engineering in the private sector, so I am all for spending money on building. The people creating these policies are just clueless. What we ought to start really fighting for is for America to go full nuclear for energy, get rid of that astigmatism around it....and it doesn&#39;t help the most popular HBO mini series Chernobyl happen to be out right now.

Both India and China have cancelled practically all new coal power plants. For the 1st time in 40 years my country (Ireland) didn't burn any coal for power generation last month. Our neighbors, the UK, had their first week without coal power in their grid in nearly 140 years. Across the EU we've cut emissions by 20%. The US is lagging behind....

If we have learned anything from the success of the United States and also from the exponential progress of technology, it is that the free market, when incentivized properly, does an incomparably better job than the government can do at literally everything. At our current technological level, there is zero logic to the proposals in the new deal, it would simply cause an economic collapse. What NEEDS to happen is for energy technology to become more efficient, specifically regarding energy storage(IE batteries). Unless some kind of efficient hydrogen engine is discovered, which is not guaranteed, the only clear solution is to make renewable energy significantly more efficiently harvested and stored(ESPECIALLY stored).at our current technological levels, the green new deal is actually the most ridiculous proposal i have ever witnessed.

Stop buying into fast fashion (and stop buying clothes only to return them. Returned clothes are nearly always incinerated). Reuse and recycle. Stop leaving stuff on standby. Stop being wasteful with toilet paper (no joke that’s one of the biggest contributors to deforestation). Avoid palm oil products. Look into your options for renewable energy.

There are over a billion internal combustion engines on earth, and to get the U.S into net zero emissions will not just require reducing them in the US but in other countries as well because the US imports a lot of products and those products travel from foreign countries by land, air and sea before they even reach the US border. The critical element in solving the energy crisis is to come up with a high density and high energy delivery battery that will last longer than most solar panels which is also chemically and biologically safe, once that is done, the Green New Deal can at least be a serious proposal.

What about India? What about dozens of other developing countries that are just now hitting their own industrial revolutions? My understanding of climate change is that it is a global problem. So how does the US torpedoing it&#39;s own economy relative to our competitors out of some strange sense of green righteousness help the global situation?

And along with it, major airlines and intercontinental airports.<br /><br />With today&#39;s battery technology, electric aircraft are very limited in size and range; the introduction of larger electric airplanes appropriate for mid-range or overseas flights would have to wait for some truly revolutionary improvements in battery energy density. Nothing even resembling what we have today would be sufficient.	UCf_jPMiTyApF70pD7MNLq-g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf_jPMiTyApF70pD7MNLq-g	0

Even here at the capital, power outage used to be common and happen at least one per month, at the richer part of the city. We have now qualms to the zero eission plans. But developed countries don't want to share their tecnology to built more advanced tide, hydro, geothermal, wind tecnology. And we are just not knowlegdeable and skilled to do that. But on the other hand, we need electricity, and we can't ignore that developed nations don't want to help us. Even with those painfull realisation, we try to minimize our inpact, by not building any oil powered reactors, because they will polute more.

We have a President that apparently doesn’t understand wind power, a Congress and Senate ( on both sides) that’s scared to act because the lobbyists that work with big industry tell them this is bad. Past environmental policies that were passed showed that the sky wouldn’t fall but big business fought hard against every one of them, from car emissions to coal plants.

Methane does have a place in this world, as do all greenhouse gases. However, it is a delicate balance, and human activity has thrown it off. That has been clear to us for many years. Go ahead, keep drinking your milk, “regulate” the number of cattle that was PLANNED by us humans. Hate to break it to you, cows don’t live in the wild. The only place humans have a healthy impact eating meat is for example, hunting to regulate deer populations, which is fantastic. There are many healthier, more efficient ways of getting the nutrients meat provides. I’m not saying goodbye cows, I’m saying, be educated about what your food does to the earth.

And it’s actually been proven that developed countries production of meat has LARGELY contributed to the starvation of underdeveloped countries. Meat production uses massive amounts of crops that could a) be more efficiently feeding humans, and b) save water use that could also help solve the problem of water availability. It takes about 8 bathtubs of water to produce a single hamburger. Couldn’t we be using that critical resource in a smarter way?

So yes, cows are a huge problem. I’m not saying getting rid of them is the solution to everything, it’s not. But if everyone made an effort to eat less meat, even just one meal a week, a huge difference could be made.

I am not employed by any energy company or a company that relies on fossil fuels but if I were I would never vote for this bill. My contention is along these “promises” they make. If I’ve learn anything over the years is that promises are usually just that, promises. But for the sake of the video these promises do come to fruition I still wouldn’t like them. Your going to eliminate millions of jobs ranging from coal miners, to automobile engineers and you say your going to replace their jobs. My question is what are you going to replace them with? Are they all going to work for the government? The guy in the video calls this “economic freedom” but I don’t see how it’s freedom for people when your eliminating their jobs and giving them ones you want them to have. As an American I think economic freedom is the ability to choose whether or not I work in the coal mines, or a solar panel factory worker or wind turbine builder. I don’t perceive freedom as my job being eliminated by the government and then offered a replacement by the government and have to take it because otherwise I’d be homeless.

The technology is simply not there and the impact in the economy catastrophic (unsustainable debt). IMO the real uncomfortable truth is that human beings are impacting our planet on an unprecedented scale because of our energy consumption and our population. We should reduce consumption, optimize emissions where possible, but we will keep impacting our environment somehow.

As of today renewables are cheaper to create equal amount of energy. Maybe don't use data from 3 years ago 2. Typical stat based on asian power plants. Look at the nuclear power plants in the UK, France and Finnland which are currently build and you see how long it takes with western safety standards. In the UK it is assumed to take way over 10 years to build the Hinkley Point nuclear plant. The Flamanville power plant in France took 13 years until now and still isn't finished. And in Finnland the construction of the Olkiluoto plant took even over 15 years and is still not finished. 5. Maybe, but the US has over 1 million square miles of plains on top of that solar is best used on the roof. Batteries are getting cheaper fast so in a couple of years you can even use it to create your whole power yourself. 6. No giant batteries are needed with a smart grid in combination with Vehicle-to-grid. It's the concept scientists and economist are saying is the best possible way for 100% renewable energy. Charge your car at the day at work with e.g. solarpower and use it for powering at night. One tesla could give energy for a home für a full week so the battery is definitly not the problem and research shows this could even expand the lifespan of modern batteries (if used the right way). 7. You only need more and more people using electric cars. Another solution is power-to-gas, which also doesn't need rare earth materials, has the efficiency of nuclear and coal but only needs water.

A nuclear power plant only takes 40-60 months to construct 3. Solar is way more expensive to maintain 4. This point doesn't even make sense because they are companies, which are based in Japan, where 30% of it's electric power is from nuclear and they plan to increase it to 40% 5. To convert the U.S. into fully wind and solar millions of acres of land will have to be demolished thus creating more problems. A normal 1,000 megawatt nuclear plant takes up around 1.3 square miles, while a 1,000 megawatt solar farm takes up around 14 square miles and even worse a 1,000 megawatt wind farm takes up 260-360 square miles! 6. Not to mention the space you'll need for a giant battery to hold the energy the solar creates for the night and since batteries aren't perfect they would lose so much energy just by sitting there 7. Also, to construct a battery of that size you will need so much rare earth metals its cleaner to mine plutonium and uranium	UCR1IjmgdVyXaYhed27AIaWg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR1IjmgdVyXaYhed27AIaWg	1	UgxfnzbZYPnnw1SV1O14AaABAg	CoolStuff Unboxings

Renewables are cheaper in a lot of cases than most fossil fuels according to the Bloomberg New Energy Finance just released this year. And nobody is saying you need to turn of every consisting power plant in the next year, the point is today it is cheaper to install wind and solar than build a new nuclear power plant. Alone in the last year the US has installed wind and solar in the capacity of 10+ nuclear power plants (10.6 gigawatts of solar and 11.9 gigawatts of wind)	UCYbA9FUxXuwVBy3teXhXonA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYbA9FUxXuwVBy3teXhXonA	1	UgxfnzbZYPnnw1SV1O14AaABAg	CoolStuff Unboxings

Building new nuclear power plant takes around 12-15 years (In that time renewables also keep getting cheaper so they wont be competitive once activated) 3. Nuclear power ist the only power source which got more expensive over time. Meanwhile Solar has fallen 34% in price in the last year alone. 4. More and more companies are moving away from nuclear power because of the cost. Look at Hitachi and Toshiba in the UK.

He gave us the oil deposits during the great flood to provide for your large population today and to take ourselves out of the stone age into easier times. And there is a promise in the bible he will stop what some think is to be our nuclear war before its to late. Don&#39;t let them brainwash you into thinking we as a human race is on our own. We are not in charge. God is.	UC-em6jwhkcjDu8JEk7TbLvA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-em6jwhkcjDu8JEk7TbLvA	0

Mathew 24:21 "For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be. except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened." Though this passage does not say Nuclear war, whatever it is. It has the potential to kill all life on planet earth. It is not far fetched to think this being the case.

Read the Green New Deal and do your own research. Don’t listen to people who are simply funded to say this. I have read the Green New Deal. It is legislation and it is supposed to be. It was voted on and lost because of some of the absolutely ridiculous things added to the GND. There is no doubt that the climate is warming and it is an extremely huge issue, but this GND does not solve that unless certain unnecessary terms are taken off. You can yell and scream at me all you want, but your words are worthless and meaningless if you haven’t thought this through on your own and actually done the proper research on the document in question. Some of the terms are idiotic. Either the ridiculous terms go, or it will never succeed.	UCuhyWweNHxbRAM8axK9elxA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuhyWweNHxbRAM8axK9elxA	0

Everything you have an enjoy today is emergent from that. For people here it&#39;s easy to think that it&#39;s no big deal to revolutionize the agricultural, transportation, energy and heavy industries, when in fact these hold much of the jobs in the world. No way the economy could ever sustain such a radical and massive change. This green revolution will come, but not by destroying current economic and social model, but by replacing it with technologies and systems that make sense. Just as it is happening with transportation and energy industry. Things are moving slowly but they are accelerating. We need better technologies in order to do so.

That is socialism and it is always born out of a government who &quot;knows what is best for everyone&quot;. Government is not known to take complete control and give it back. It is also unlikely a people will be able to get to the other side and be ready to work and get off government care.

Try and change minds or possibly have yours changed, not pretend to be the moral authority and discount everyone around you. To begin the discussion, I will put forth: The Industry is going towards green energy naturally, without Government influence. Why do we need Government overreach to help this along, when it is happening naturally? If Climate Change is so true and undeniable, why do they have to rename it every 5 years to keep it factually correct? Why is every future climate model proven wrong? Why do they use the largest lie on the planet, the 99% scientific consensus myth, to try and push it? Why is it all these climate change activists only focus on regular households when we produce by far the least emissions at the moment compared to livestock and developing nations?

Current day Green Energy solutions just aren&#39;t efficient enough to compete with Fossil Fuels so assuming that all workers are covered by social programs (&amp; assuming we can afford it, which spoiler, we cannot) it would cripple economic productivity. This just isn&#39;t realistic at all, I&#39;m sorry and this is coming from a fellow Democrat.<br /><br />Instead, I would recommend using government incentives such as subsidiaries and tax benefits to EV Car makers such as Tesla among other Green Companies. We can also invest in Nuclear Fusion which is much greener and MUCH more efficient than Fossil Fuels. We know Nuclear Fusion has the potential to be efficient because we have the sun so it would definitely be a safe investment knowing this is possible. These solutions will not only create a greener environment but a much more stable one that yields greater economic productivity.

More products are being made from recycled products. Scientists are finding ways to decompose plastics faster. Solar and wind companies are growing. Beekeeping is increasing. More people are gardening. Recycling rates used to be less than 26% now it is 36-37%. Compost collection has increased by over 239%. Cars are becoming more fuel efficient. New constructions are implementing "green" ideas. Companies are removing straws and plastic bags. Paper use is declining. Environmentally friendly neighborhoods are being built. Companies are creating products from reused materials.	UCHkExZUgYAMI2yJ1OeSEJew	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHkExZUgYAMI2yJ1OeSEJew	1	UgxxGeBkUqGESmh_kvh4AaABAg	Simone

That's 9.3 trillion a year. No one has that. Not even disney has that money. All this Assumes that there are no legal issues, no safety issues, no unexpected costs, etc. That's also assuming that contracts will be filled on time, job positions filled, no one negotiating above the expected salary, etc. For the record, disney didnt actually have 73 billion dollars when it bought Fox. If you read the financial report, it states that it gave the shareholders 50% or more in stocks. Disney then received 13.8 billion in debt. The remaining amount of the 73 billion was actual cash they had. Again not enough to pay 9.3 trillion in one year.

I&#39;m from outside the states and know that a single country, or a single hemisphere changing its habits isn&#39;t enough to change the climate, it&#39;d be necessary that all country&#39;s halt their industries temporarily and that the industrialization of south america, Africa, Asia and the mid-east be restricted. The green new deal is flawed in the sense that it is not enough to change the climate and greatly hinders people. Even if people have different jobs open, transitioning is a difficult process and you can&#39;t make thousands of people do it, and we can&#39;t expect that they have the necessary qualifications for the new job. Furthermore, deleting all internal combustion engines would delete all cars and trucks freezing all industries and economic actions, and because we don&#39;t yet have affordable and efficient electric cars and trucks the economy would instantly collapse. The green new deal isn&#39;t a step, its a leap, a leap into an abyss, and it is truly surprising that there are or where people that thought that it was a good idea, or any form of progress, or a political tool capable of swaying voters. The green new deal, if anything, is to be seen as regressive, and an example to show how some people are ignorant and others are desperate to take control of everything on earth, including its climate.

Sending the GDP to the tank and skyrocketing energy prices. I wonder who that would've hurt the most by those rising costs? Maybe the already struggling middle class? I wonder if then that would force a lot more people to rely on governmental subsidies? Subsidies that somebody has to pay for...

Not trying to backdoor in sanctioned wide scale discrimination on a federal level. Solar and wind take up a lot of space in comparison to nuclear. So we give the federal government carte blanche to address this threat that will end the world in 12 years, better get those low density power plants up quick! Exercise eminent domain on a massive scale, it's a crisis after all! Sorry Mr. Jones, your cattle ranch is antiquated, we're seizing it for a solar farm. And guess what?

In communism, they hunt you down, put shackles on your feet, choose your job for you, and whip you when you complain. The difference may be subtle, but, it is there. The reason why we prefer capitalism is that there is some type of limited freedom, which is better than none at all.

Really we needed to start a more gradual process a couple of decades ago at least. But we didn&#39;t, so now we just need to try and reach achievable targets asap. And unfortunately things like the green new deal Just make people hate green policies even more, because they are so extreme. I think he need to gradually implement change one thing at a time so that the people that don&#39;t like it, don&#39;t notice so much.

Yes America depicted in Hollywood movies and nights on the town will be drastically different. Yes the government will have to completely flip to a world that is deprived of what our country thrives on. Yes, all of this is part of this deal. They dont understand that we are in too deep to, to come out of this clean. We cant make it out of this one without any changes. The solution this deal proposes is a huge answer to a problem that is just as big if not bigger. Our country, it&#39;s way of working has caused this problem. And if we want the problem to be fixed, we have to change it. This isnt a &quot;want&quot; from treehuggers. This isnt a &quot;please&quot; from Democrats. This is a MUST for our WORLD. It&#39;s a necessity. And we need to do something. I repeat, WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING. And this green deal will do what we need. But it will cost us. Only because we haven&#39;t took action before. If we did something earlier on these changes wouldnt be as drastic. But our ignorance and blindsided mindsets to this issue have only compounded the amount of changes we need to make, and had only multiplied the drasticness of the changes. We&#39;ve dug ourselves downward. And now, we wont be able to make it out without some humongous changes. The more we dont take action, the more drastic these changes will become.

I am a Liberal that believes that we need to take action to stop climate change, but the Green New Deal is one of the most idiotic things I&#39;ve ever seen. You completely skipped over the Q&amp;A section of the bill where they explained how they plan to deliver these results, you skipped over the fact that nobody voted for it including AOC, you skipped over the fact that there were sections in it also calling for things like Universal Healthcare, Free Houses, mandatory retrofitting of all building in the US, and the fact that the entire cost of all this would be the burden of the American Taxpayer. And for a bill that&#39;s supposed to be about reducing emissions in the best way possible, it never talks about the two best methods there are, Nuclear Power nearly the cleanest form of energy and most efficient, and a Carbon Tax. It&#39;s very sad to see how dishonest your journalism is becoming.	UCTAt1tc_B8iyVKZ3Ee-4J9w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTAt1tc_B8iyVKZ3Ee-4J9w	0

We will not get to zero carbon emissions and maintain our standard of living without nuclear power. This is as much of a fact as global warming but the Democrats behind the Green New Deal will not agree to any plan that includes nuclear power. There is no language specific to nuclear power in the 14-page letter but as this video states it currently doesn’t contain firm solutions but the work it is derived from is firmly antinuclear power. One side is happy to lie and ignore reality. The other side selectively chooses facts and fails to do the math to its completion.

It’s responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions than all fossil fuels combined, and yes, we absolutely have to get rid of fossil fuels, but what about the other half? No one acknowledges that half because they don’t want to change their diet, but as this video pointed out, climate change is an emergency. We can do step by step anymore. If you’re not willing to change something as simple as the food you eat for the future of our planet, then how is that any better than the congressmen who won’t change legislation because it’s “too difficult” upfront? Idk, just my thoughts.	UCflxXHyawF_UZCBVv1qrvYg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCflxXHyawF_UZCBVv1qrvYg	0

When you pass such a measure that involves retrofitting buildings to reduce the effects of climate change, you have to think of the unintended consequences of such a measure. <br /><br />You will undoubtedly have poor people who live in homes that will not meet the green new deal requirements and as such, these people (they are poor mind you) will have to shell out thousands of dollars to upgrade their building. Well these folks can&#39;t afford this and will be forced out of their homes. I just want folks to realize that as noble as something sounds to you, there are unintended consequences others feel.

We have to run cars and planes using something else. Global Warming is more important than transportation, if you ask me. People can't make the Country run Solar instead of Coal. The Government is the only one which can do that. I as an individual can only switch off appliances when not in use, which won't even make tiny dent in Climate Change. PS: I love when people read through other people's views and then present their's instead of just skimming through to pick mistakes to put forward their own opinion as the only correct one! So of course, I would love to watch your video and interact with you over there. And even though as of now, I don't agree with your points, it helps me think from a broader perspective and lets me know about mistakes in my opinions(Where the overall opinion is still right in my view and I just assumed some details in my opinion wrongly).

Think about it currently or even in the next ten years( cause that’s how long AOC it will take) what can we use instead of fuel to fly planes or drive cars. And my other point is why is the government the only way to stop global warming cause that’s what this plan inherently wants to do. I think if anything it should be the people, not the government.

SIVAH.	@Radiant Inspiration, US is in a position to release less now because of the huge amounts they have already released in the past which has uplifted their economy. I am not degrading US by saying that she should be the first to start a Green Deal. I believe US has the power to make other countries follow her and so I feel like she should be the first one to release a Deal like this(I'm not saying she should be the only one, just that she should start one). Btw what's wrong with the US starting one? I don't see any wrong. The technology she gains by doing this first can be sold to other developing nations, who don't have the viability like US to just start using Renewables all of a sudden. I do understand your point tho. When I came to know that Brazil is suddenly increasing deforestation, I was furious. But I do understand that they are developing and a lot of people live in poverty and the Amazon is like one of their most consistent resources. Not saying that this is a valid reason to start cutting down trees, but that they have no other option other than have their economy fall down with no other country helping them.

We are one of the least polluting countries in the world. While yes we do contribute, the contribution is miniscule. So why should the United States be the only country to find a solution or do something about it if the other countries won’t contribute	UCDFSX5FkQCKAvKoKC_pKfRg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDFSX5FkQCKAvKoKC_pKfRg	1	UgxSF75N3PKPIfCH1VF4AaABAg	DRskayker

And what I meant was that the US government gave the reason for their invasion as to maintain Peace, right? (Even though it wasn't and that's why I said 'sought') So they should also lead the World by implementing such a deal as they are already the richest country in the World. They were also the largest emitter for a long time and only recently are transitioning away. Developing nations are only starting to release huge amounts recently and putting a strain on them without any help from developed nations is not fair.

But please don’t use that as a way not to make large scale changes to industry. Even if every person cut their personal footprint down to the very lowest possible, entire industries still send a lot of carbon into the atmosphere. The point here is that we need to be lowering the temperature of the planet, which means *all* carbon emission needs to be cut down. We’re on track to blow past 2 degrees, and plateauing at 2 degrees isn’t okay either.

Europe overall has the most progression in cutting emissions, India is still facing widespread poverty and China has some policies in place though it is hard to say if they will actually go through with the political situation going on there.

The US, Canada, and Isreal are the only developed countries that are currently cutting emissions and those three together make up less than 13% of emissions, while China and India make up around 60-65% of emissions and those who joined the Paris accords are increasing their emissions more rapidly than any other countries. The US cutting emissions means absolutely nothing without specifically China and India and very little if Europe cut emissions.

If commercial air travel can be replaced with comparatively fast, lower-emission forms of travel, then commercial air travel will be unnecessary for the vast majority of people. So we have to develop a better solution, even though, as the video states, the transition to said solution will be difficult. But even if the GND did say air travel should be banned, that shouldn't lead to you rejecting the entire GND outright. If you believe that climate change is a problem, then support a less drastic solution to commercial air travel. But if you don't believe climate change is a problem, as I suspect you don't, no solution would ever work for you.

But we shouldn&#39;t destroy ourselves now because if we do the Green New Deal it will destroy the economy because it wants to replace all buildings in 10 years. The amount of workers they need to do that is horribly high. They would have to do forced labor. The bill costs are enormously high and we will destroy the USA trying to pay for it. The things they will say they will provide to people who lose there jobs won&#39;t happen because they will have to tax everyone to nothingness and it would cost just to have the government run so they can get that money to people. Plus the people they are trying to get money to probably won&#39;t have much tax to give so by them losing a their job the government gets less to give back to them through taxes. This bill is just socialism hidden in climate change. If this was passed the government would have free range to do anything to &quot;help the environment&quot; They would have the power to eliminate any job they deam not environmental healthly or kick you out of your house because it isn&#39;t energy efficient and when they redo it the cost will fall on you the tax payers and then the government would own everything.

But balance change is needed and i don’t trust the mind set that imposes harshly with your food and water and life. What is not happening is Republicans, every step of the way defeating even gradual changes since the Sixties. Carter put us on track for a more diverse energy use platform, and Republicans trashed it in weeks of the Reagan Admin. Diesel can be green, using carbon already in the air to put into energy. Smaller vehicles have better options for electric. The battery issue needs work though. Trains are now Green and the most energy efficient means of transport. Killing off all the cows means those that refuse to eat anything but meat will kill off the wildlife, similar disastrous result, dead US. Science is no longer listened too because of a political agenda sponsored media brainwashing to encourage no democracy, no compromise, no respect, no mutual understanding. Politics caused this, guided by personal pay offs and money earnings from oil, and the rights of Corporations to lobby and structure government policy, something the peoples voice do not have the money or organization abilities to achieve (Thanks US Supreme Court). The US is in a moral, ethical, and environmental crisis. But i cant get behind people who don’t have the wisdom presented in a bill that thinks Alaska can grow all its own food, or that green diesel is ready for sub zero weather use, solar is not going to work well at northern latitudes. Now this bill says people have to suffer, thats a bill of evil, a mind set no better than that of the oil based agenda.

One thing a lot of people don't take into account when comparing EVs with ICE cars is the cost of running the car and maintenance. EVs are much cheaper to drive and don't require as much maintenance (almost no oil changes, only very few moving parts and a lot less break pad wear since you can use regenerative braking, using the motor, to slow down the car).

Coal power causes orders of magnitude more cancer deaths than nuclear ever could. HBO's Chernobyl is an amazing series and a must-watch, but it's message is more that you should always accept the truth and science, or it will catch up to you eventually. It's unfortunate that many people's takeaway is that uranium is the fuel of the devil. The US is not the USSR in the 1980s. There is no censorship of huge flaws and safety always goes before money, especially in an industry under as much scrutiny as Nuclear. Nuclear is so safe that even reactors built in the 1980s that have been outfitted with modern safety equipment and procedures are still considered safer than any other power source. New reactor types like pebble-bed and molten fuel reactors will make atomic even safer. And no, you don't need nuclear plants in "every neighbourhood". In fact, you'd need far more coal or gas plants to supply a grid than nuclear. More wind and solar will be a great supplement to the power grid. Solar panel prices are decreasing constantly, but until they are cheap enough and public will is great enough to stick them on every home roof (and even after that), we will need a stable power backbone: Nuclear.

It's not perfect, but all sources of energy have problems. The two disasters we did have were based on bad designs, from which we have learned. Our track record with oil, gas, and coal isn't exactly stellar either, where the accidents number two or more a YEAR rather than two in three decades. Even wind, hydro, and solar come with downsides, pollution, and the use of dangerous materials. Fun fact: The biggest lobbying efforts against nuclear is actually the fossil fuel industry, including oil and natural gas. They throw more dollars against nuclear than they do wind and solar, and you should be asking why (hint: It's not because of Chernobyl).

And also unsuccessful projects like the futuristic, hovering F35 of yours? Leaving the Paris agreement was worse enough, this mindset of the Republicans is the wrong one in dealing with the issue.

India is spending a tons of money on renewable projects but they have too small economy to implement gigantic investments. At the end of the day the usa remain the second biggest polluter in the world way more than india itself when we look at greenhouse gas emissions and the usa is the biggest economy in the world. Usa has the money and power to do that, china and india don’t have that and despite that they still do.

Picture the following:<br /><br />You along with another 500 humans are the last remains of humankind, travelling on a spaceship from an already-destroyed earth to a new planet that has been proven to be in good conditions for human life. You are designated captain and have limited fuel for the trip, which will last 250 years. You won&#39;t be able to experience the arrival because you will be dead by that time, but future generations that breed within the spaceship will, as long as fuel lasts long enough to reach the planet. Then there is this crucial choice, you can spend more fuel today to live a better life within the spaceship (more showers, better quality food, more entertainement, etc), or you can save fuel to actually reach that planet that you wont experience but future generations will be glad you did. In order to do that you have to cut off this aforementioned privileges.<br /><br />This is the ultimate test to human narcicissm, to actually pospone our way of life for something we can&#39;t fully understand or picture.

But instead people are taught to think its a super dangerous energy despite the least amount of deaths on the job from it. <br /><br /><br />Also Chernobyl and Fukishima were age old generation 1 or 2 reactors with horrible safeguards and planning when they were built; human error.

Only the constructionphase would take at least 10 years. In that time we will already have shifted to an decentrelized and more efficient powergrid which favors local energygeneration rather than far away centralised power plants which deliver through inefficient high to low tension conversions.

I say this knowing I would be one of the people who could potentially lose everything to this change, and I do not have much now. But the people who are in power now, Republican and Democrat, will never allow this to happen. They would be on equal footing with the everyday person and they do not want that. It is going to take a disaster, something huge, destructive, with millions of lives lost; that is when things will change. And it has to happen in America. It has to happen in our backyard, we have to feel it. 9/11 was a drop in the bucket, all the mass shootings barely messed up our hair; its going to be so big, so loud, we cannot possibly ignore it.

If you look at the Apollo program, the actual New Deal, and the Manhattan Project, you'll see that government can have a role in making big things happen, and can do a pretty good job of it. The "New Deal" part of the GND specifically refers to that New Deal. It's not "everyone will work for the government", though government jobs certainly are a big part of it. We already have alternatives to fossil fuels, things we could be doing right now. We don't need to wait for petroleum to run out, we could be doing these things right now. But we aren't because people are used to their artificially, unrealistically comfortable lives, and in the US we also have this awful thing where people think that they should be able to do anything they want if it's available and they can afford it. Nobody will be saying "I sure am glad I owned a huge lifted truck I didn't need" when the ice caps are gone and there are tornadoes in Vermont. Climate change is objectively a very bad thing. Being able to grow tomatoes in January is great until you realize that it came at the cost of fisheries collapsing, coral reefs ceasing to exist, thousands of species going extinct, and large areas of the globe being uninhabitable.

The new industry would be heavily controlled by the government. I don't know about you, but I for one don't trust the government in control of a major economic artery. As climate change(at least this threatening caricature) supposedly damages the economy, it provides opportunities in colder areas that used to be uninhabitable and drastically lowers damage caused by cold temperatures. And these opportunities here aren't controlled by the government. Everyone, including the big fossil fuel companies know that the source is finite. But that doesn't mean it's running out anytime soon. While there still are available resources, people will continue to use them. When it does run out, companies will have already developed another source, which by then would be cheaper than fossil fuels. There is no need for the government to force it's hand on the ever-changing free market. Every modern example proves that a command economy always ends in failure.

Many many jobs will be created by transitioning to a low-carbon economy, and it'll be a boost to a great many industries. If we don't do it however, the cost will be very very high. Climate change will wreck almost every sector of the economy. Also, we know for a fact that fossil fuels are a finite resource, so why is anyone arguing that we shouldn't transition to other energy sources? We know for certain that we will run out of petroleum, and we know for certain that burning it causes many problems (even if you ignore the climate-affecting ones), and we have alternatives, so why is it such a revolutionary idea to switch? It isn't, it's simply logical.	UC7-68KVPsW-jKBmOcPnYSHg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7-68KVPsW-jKBmOcPnYSHg	1	UgwZ7PTreUCcvbgIKDJ4AaABAg	B May

It will become an obstacle that will take up the news and shift attention away from the environment. And it isnt the 1% who will also get hurt, but also the people who produce frivilous things. Those mansions built have given jobs to contractors, legal teams, apprasial agents, suppliers, architects, gardners. Those luxury cars built gave jobs to drivers, blue collars, inspectors, paint suppliers and producers, chemists, engineers, artists etc. You can appy this to any frivilous item. Someone had to produce it. In order to stay in business and provide jobs, those Manufacturers had to sell those products to the frivilous rich people.

More people are gardening. Recycling rates used to be less than 26% now it is 36-37%. Compost collection has increased by over 239%. Cars are becoming more fuel efficient. New constructions are implementing "green" ideas. Companies are removing straws and plastic bags. Paper use is declining. Etc. So we are doing something about it.

Ugxvs_3vnmXDBu4tplF4AaABAg	0	0	2019-06-12 17:08:32	M Z	It&#39;s a mistake that the Green New Deal ruled out a carbon tax to fund it. Nearly all economists agree that a carbon tax is the best way of reducing emissions. <br /><br /><br />Many say that a carbon tax cannot reduce emissions fast enough, but it all depends on how high the government sets the price. There&#39;s a bill in congress now that proposes a carbon tax with very high prices. A study shows that this bill would reduce carbon emissions by 90% by 2050 in the US. That&#39;s a little off mark from the IPCC report, but that doesn&#39;t take into account increased innovation caused by the carbon tax, which will be guaranteed to happen if companies are under so much pressure from the tax. <br /><br /><br />Another issue that needs to be addressed concerning a carbon tax is how the poor would be unfairly impacted by the tax. To remedy this, the carbon tax can be &quot;revenue neutral&quot;, where the tax revenue is cycled back to everyone. We could go a step further and refund the revenue progressively, so that income inequality is reduced as well, which is very much in line with the goals of the Green New Deal.

The lives of every living being on the world are at risk, but Americans are still divided in a two party oligarchy, where the &quot;left&quot; are the democrats, with their liberal identitarism, their obsession with profits and consumerism. The US spend billions creating wars all over the world, but says there&#39;s no money to save it... Americans are leading the world to its end. There&#39;s no hope anymore, only dispair. And we have to act now. We have to make sacrifices. We have to work together. It&#39;s not about money, or being the number one, or being the greatest nation, it&#39;s about all of us, together, fighting for a better world for the first time. Creating a new way to think, create, connect and act, where there&#39;s no power, but there are LIVES.	UCm-r3yJqJXc4I8G6s4ulv-w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm-r3yJqJXc4I8G6s4ulv-w	0

Like people have a right to be angry when they do something and got nothing in return unless its common courtesy. Evn when so many aren't aware of the problem until it's too late. Which we are getting to that point. Hardly anyone wants to help someone who they don't know. People are selfish by nature but then again they have plenty reason to be. We just need to help them along to benefit us all. Help people understand that helping others instead of removing then will benefit us and not create this endless cycle of pain. Hope you know what im referring to. Something always leads to another. But of course that should be obvious.

Sometimes local farms that produce meat is the only way some communities strive. And not everybody is to keen on giving up meat and it's already hard enough for some to afford imported products. The economy wil go down drastically. Many will go homeless and it's already hard enough as it is to find a job. Some Small industries wont be able to thrive if they cannot stock up on products provided by other companies. If we are talking about localy owned farms then what about the bigger cities which they take mostly from imports. Their will be more demand then supply. And of course their will be resistance from the public to account for who lose their jobs. The lower class will increase higher then it has now and frankly im living it right now and let me say it's not a pleasant experience. Annnnd you jist addressed most of this... Cule. Sorry couldn't read it all was on mobile... Anyways... This isn't an idea people are to consider. To manu problems to account for. This demands sacrifice people aren't willing to take especially when it means becoming poor. We could ask for help from allies but even still it wont be enough. -------------------------------- This is truly a pickle we're in. Too much ignorance and what not. Too many not aware of the problem. But hey atleast you gave a good suggestion.. Just too much to account for. (Especially when it comes to people) And yeh.

Wether ot be schools, food, shleter. Nobody wants to do something for nothing. Especially if they feel it was earned. We need jobs to keep moving things along. Who will make your food, clothes, etc. No one will do it for nothing. Jobs and money is important to move society going and living.

The air is too thin to get enough lift to take off. I honestly don't think battery-powered electric planes are the answer to the problem, but I can see hydrogen powered planes being viable because hydrogen has a much higher energy density per kg than batteries do.

The economy will be disrupted no doubt about that but if your county, community, district, state, city, town is buying from their area instead of a place who knows where then that would take up less fuel/energy and jobs are provided locally. Currently, jobs are provided by big companies because they can afford to. They distribute meat far away, take the money and use it to pay a lot of workers that prepare the meat. If we start going local, the big industry will go away and smaller businesses can thrive. Jobs can be created this way as all places will need a local place to get their meat and food from. The economy will drop due to the loss of big money supporting jobs but it can be stable over most likely a long period of time. It might never be as big as it is now but it will be different which could create many possibilities for the future. Jobs can be created locally as all places will need food and it costs a lot of money and fuel/energy to travel far. Food will have to be sourced closer to home and there's a lot of towns in the US who will need food and will need to create some of their own. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I know this is long and not completely accurate. Please don't see this as concrete because it's not. This is just an idea, this is likely what we have to turn to in the future and jobs will be lost but as jobs close jobs open. Future is hard to predict so please don't roast me. A lot of jobs will be lost that is certain. As time goes on there will be more jobs. There is a lot of infrastructures that will need to be built if we head into zero fossil fuels (electric charging stations, energy grids, solar panels, windmills, biomass, biofuel, and biogas, construction of cars). This is all very expensive so we'll see how the future turns out. *If you read this thank you, let's open the conversation up in a positive way ty.

Being environmentally conscious such as recycling isn&#39;t enough. They have to go to the extreme and put everyone out of business. I wish these politicians would live in coal country and tell everyone that feeding their kids doesn&#39;t matter. Heck, some of my favorite fishing and camping spots is on the river right next to coal mines. The fish, animals, trees and air doesn&#39;t seem to mind them. I guarantee you that it is way cleaner in my state of WV then it is in disgusting LA or NY.	UC20vJhuVAWNdQqW4TTtI3Vg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC20vJhuVAWNdQqW4TTtI3Vg	0

We&#39;d just also have to deal with an equal, if not greater, blow to our economy from aggressively cutting our energy usage. <br /><br />I also think it&#39;s weird how you just glossed over how cutting coal and oil from our energy usage would require drastic changes to the way energy is used in America today, because we&#39;d be working with a small fraction of it. Heating homes in the north during winter and cooling homes in the south during summer would have to stop, everyone would only be able to eat meat a few times a week, and we&#39;d need a host of other drastic lifestyle changes no sane person would reasonably expect the vast majority of Americans to voluntarily do.

The houses cost anywhere between $230,000 - $400,000. There are also environmentally friendly homes starting at $4 million dollars. It's great for saving the environment. Especially since they used recycled materials and focus on smart green planning. You should buy one. You're right after all. Why should YOU be concerned with the cost? What is it with money?

So a tree normaly takes co2 from the air and mixes it with other chemicals in order to produce sugar, while this happens is the co2 is cut into two new things o2(oxygen) and c(carbon) wich gets build into the plant. So after the tree dies the carbon inside him doesn't vanishes into thin air, but instead(most times) gets realesed back into the air as co2 by microbes who decompose the tree So the cycle begins again from new. So after you learned this, do you now understand that your forest always uses the same amount of co2 and also gives back the same amount of co2 back into the air(as long as the total amount of the trees doesn't incress/decresses permantly) wich means that it wont save us from climate change since we add more co2 into a cycle that only is able to reuse the co2 that it produces itself and not our co2	UCV_KsWYtC6vjpko0K-DTb6Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV_KsWYtC6vjpko0K-DTb6Q	1	UgxQXWGGdquyCp3NCDR4AaABAg	Bea nos.

Government plans to have Ubers and other hide hailing apps to have 60% electric fleets by 2025 with complete electrification somewhere in 2030-40. India is actually pushing Solar so much that its legitimately cheaper to buy Solar Energy. It costs just 6.4 Cents per Kilowatt hour, about 14% lower than Coal Plants. Our 20,000 Megawatt Solar by 2022 goal was achieved back in 2018, 4 years ahead of schedule, our new goal is 100,000 Megawatt of Solar by 2022 and by the way, 35% of all electricity in India is from renewable with about 70-80% of new capacity added to grid being renewable. We are time and time again overachieving our targets which were already considered pretty ambitious. We are out pacing USA not only in % of renewable capacity added but also in pure Megawatt figures despite the disparity in wealth of both nations. China is also in the same boat. At least we're doing our part. I just hope the entire world can get together and solve this crisis.

As the permafrost melts, massive amounts of methane will be released into the atmosphere. Methane is a greenhouse gas that is 34 times more powerful than carbon dioxide. It is stored inside the permafrost in the form of methane hydrate, and it is estimated that 2,000 to 10,000 gigatons of methane are currently stored. That's an average of 6 trillion tons. As the oceans get warmer, the solubility of gases in the water decreases, and carbon dioxide and oxygen get released into the atmosphere. This causes more warming, and the lower amounts of oxygen in the water create dead zones. Higher average temperatures also increase the risk of forest fires, which release more CO2 into the atmosphere, and gradually causes desertification.

It isn't even that good for your skin, it just isn't too harmfull. But there are even better versions which can be easily synthezised. Everything you are worrying about is beeing resolved as we dicuss. Only by properly including the real costs of co2 emissions to every end product, engineers and scientists of every industry will be encouraged to find alternatives which only right now seam too expensive because petroleum products are currently beeing subsidized by our grandchildrens potentially desastrous living conditions. Which of course we want to mitigate because I count on beeing alive for literaly ever (you probably are also unaware of the recent discoveries in genetic treatments which could one day enable you and me to witness the real cosequences of having over 400ppm CO2 concentration in our athmosphere).

If we cannot do something entirely, there are plenty of things that can be fixed. For skin care, alternatives are always viable and it's hardly necessary. I think the Green New Deal does a rather realistic job of detailing each individual thing that needs changing in general views; as resolutions tend to do. Many, many plastic goods are not necessary. Furniture there are alternatives, etc, etc. Tech needs a huge overhaul in general, and so will transport. Things we don't know how to make without plastics will be judged on their necessity, studied to be reengineered and if not hey, it's probably more of an effort than before. Life will be changed significantly. When you do research on projected studies, it's not a choice.

The problem with the green new deal is how it will do that. Immediate shifts to other sources of power are not reasonable. It would take some years to transition. The green deal does not allow for those years. It is like trying to change the world from a monarchy to a democracy in the span of one year. It’s not going to be a good thing and so much can go wrong.<br /><br />The green new deal needs to be revised. Seriously. People aren’t as worried about its economic impact as much as they are worried about its likelihood to cause massive instability	UCYNUGDXWJGpuM1IjqkYGsZg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYNUGDXWJGpuM1IjqkYGsZg	0

And how can you anticipate time is running out if you can't get a rough idea of how long you have and what's at the end of it? Seems like folk hype up like the end of the world is coming. It isn't, the climate is always changing for better or for worse and we've always managed to veer off the worst of it. Things might seem bad now but scientists have already developed carbon engineering as a way of greatly reducing CO2 emissions. New technologies will come, but I just think investing in solar, wind, reducing air travel, making electric or hybrid cars mandatory and such are obsolete.

The GND requires a massive government intervention, and that's everything that the GOP stands against. The way I see it, this will amount to nothing, and any attempt to realize it will fail spectacularly. And then the free market will automatically shift towards renewable energy once oil runs out. Of course, whether the ecosystem survives for that long is speculative.	UCep-UiWFIasDB8s62XS6BKQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCep-UiWFIasDB8s62XS6BKQ	1	Ugzq-oaFzPdJ47awUvV4AaABAg	Enes Ince

Let&#39;s be pragmatic here, fossils fuels are not going anywhere anytime soon. I personally think believe carbon neutral fuel is the way to go instead of building millions of electric cars. We are burning more fossil fuels by building electric consequently exacerbating the issue at hand. We should also keep in mind that there are many countries in the world that still haven&#39;t experienced industry revolution. How do you go about fixing this? This green deal is too optimistic and unrealistic. Let&#39;s find a much more realistic approach at solving this issue with climate change. It&#39;s implausible to think we would go from eating over 93 millions cows to eating zero.	UC2oH7h7I6flujnUX2YJ1ruA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2oH7h7I6flujnUX2YJ1ruA	0

In my opinion the documents scope should be strictly about the environment. However, just a couple of pages in, it begins to talk about labour policies, intersectionality and a whole slew of social issues that fall outside of it&#39;s scope. Not only that but it&#39;s too ambitious. I get that we&#39;re facing impending disaster but this document is too much for the American political system. It&#39;s doing too many things at once.<br /><br />If anything it&#39;s written like a well worded MUN resolution.	UC3JuBdeNCD0eLdFlegjv8Dw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3JuBdeNCD0eLdFlegjv8Dw	0

Everything you mentioned falls into the second category, protecting Americans from the inevitable social harms that come from moving away from fossil fuels. We can't save the environment without drastically changing our economy, and the average worker just doesn't want to take that risk. The reason it's called the Green _New Deal_ is because it's a labor and social welfare bill, but this time fighting climate change instead of the Great Depression.

It&#39;s simply because these people are way too old to ever see the effects of climate change in their lifetime. And for that reason, a lot of them simply don&#39;t care. For me, being 17, my life may be completely cut short by climate change, hence why I care deeply, and the same goes for many other young liberals who do. I even know young conservatives who care about climate change. Why? Because IT WILL AFFECT their lives. The issue is, a lot of the people who run our country, are way above the age of caring, and this creates a situation where no one would be in favor of a resolution like this. It&#39;s unfair politics.	UCBwz2Fl82cUIK3AVetjg5cw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBwz2Fl82cUIK3AVetjg5cw	0

Do you want to <i>spend billions</i> saving the planet in a responsible, organized manner that will ultimately cement our enginuity as a species into the future or do you want <b>lose TRILLIONS</b> to repairs, emergency aid and temporary fixes that will ultimately fail our irreversibly changed global ecosystems and likely set the human race back decades, if not hundreds of years if nothing is done?

Even in a relatively moderate country like the UK it took an outgoing politician to consider Net Carbon Neutrality by 2050. a date that is woefully late.

How about you try and get the people that actually pollute the world to stop. How about you get the people who dump the most pollution in to the oceans to stop. This is like targeting someone with a zero em car to become more environmentally sound, while a 1920&#39;s coal train is waving at you laughing.

China has also over 35 of the top 50 most polluted cities on earth. Again, fix the actual countries that are causing the problems.

However there is so much in this bill which has nothing to do with climate change at all. Healthcare, Higher level education and providing housing have nothing to do with Climate change and have just been included in there which is automatically going to put off the vast majority of republicans. I think America does need to change its stance on climate change and i am all for that, but making a bill with such loose language and being super ambiguous with the terms used is not the way to do it. This needs a V2 with a lot of the BS stripped from it	UCm1Fan2xE_--ApbqRv5dtGw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm1Fan2xE_--ApbqRv5dtGw	0

Fossil fuel is only neccessary to heat the water. Nuclear plants do it with the heat of radioactive metals, but also a dam can produce energy with the water that is falling a certain distance and therby moving said turbines. So there already is a variety of methods.	UCbL1iSIj6IZOUZ4mP2LLmoQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbL1iSIj6IZOUZ4mP2LLmoQ	1	Ugwtp6SAJz420VeJi5V4AaABAg	Rambo32g

We NEED a resource-based economy; ideas from the VENUS PROJECT and the ZEITGEIST MOVEMENT are the only ones that can save the world. The vested interests of politicians and governments actively halt the progression of humanity in order to gain more money- think about manufactured obsolescence, pretty much everything we buy is not built to last so we have to buy more. This creates more plastic, more emissions etc. resulting in the current state of the world I&#39;m sure we all know.<br />WHAT DO WE DO? We band together and demand this through CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE, where we completely halt from work and buying anything, we take and share what we need until money does not play a part in society, until corporations and politicians understand our system is broken. <br />As mentioned in the video, money is the main concern opposing the Green New Deal. For any change to happen we need to spread the word about RESOURCE BASED ECONOMIES and declare the world COMMON HERITAGE.

There are plenty of reasons to eradicate animal farming besides climate change, and plenty of plant-based alternatives for meat and dairy, that are actually healthier.

Liberals want to destroy the world's economy. This isn't a practical solution and will cause just as many deaths due to starvation and poverty as the perceived threat of climate change. They're completely delusional. Every "solution" they present is devoid of rational thought.

It’s not going to happen. ¿Comprende? The best we can do is learn to live with it. Humans will do what humans have always done. Survive. People will migrate to more habitable areas and find ways to cope with the new climate. It’s not the end of the world. Also, the “universe” does not experience itself.

The temperatures have been too hot this summer, there's already 5 deaths caused by extreme heath. The summer last two weeks longer than it did 20 years ago. The Biodiversity in my region had dropped drastically and I haven't seen a Bee in three months. The Smog in my city gets so high, we can't even see the mountains we have, who are iconic and represents our state. And we only have some industries and a lot of cars. We don't even surpass 6 million people. Now, imagine all of that to a global scale. Millions of people and tons of fossil fuels been released every second for the entire year. Meanwhile you say man made climate change is a hoax, thousands of people are been affected by the ignorance and lack of action between everyone and us. I'm not saying we are an infection nor we are monsters. No, we have light inside us, we just need to find it. We are almost divine creation, the universe experiencing itself, we are guardians who will preserve this planet and those on which we will settle down. We are humans, we commit sins but we can be forgiven and change until helping someone for everyone's wealth. Maybe a simple letter won't change your opinion, and I accept that. But please, at least try to reverse what you call Mother Earth's Climate Change. Because if we don't fight against it, the failure of ourselves will be charged upon the shoulders of our hopeless babies. And then you will hear the last prays on Earth. God bless, have a nice day, ¡ y saludos desde México!	UCQUXKukd1_Y18d0SvKOtkAQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQUXKukd1_Y18d0SvKOtkAQ	1	UgyLYdXrYBOfD54-Xtd4AaABAg	a a

I know climate change is real, but I don’t see this happen. It takes it to extreme. Plus isn’t there a Kyoto Accord that we recently pull out of. Maybe when we get back in there. Come together as a world to make a change. Is not like China going to change because of the New deal. China is extremely polluted. Worse than the US.

What I don&#39;t agree on is that The Green New Deal is just about moving the government into a position to prevent global warming from going further. It&#39;s evident in this very video considering it supports universal healthcare which is an issue totally separate from global warming, which is a big reason why so many Republicans support it. If Democrats really wanted this to be non-partisan they wouldn&#39;t be pushing additional left wing ideas into bills which they want the right to accept. Furthermore, the USA isn&#39;t even the biggest producer of greenhouse gases. Even if the USA complete stops emissions countries like India and China will still destroy the planet faster than we ever could. Fighting global warming should be primarily a question about how to stop countries like China and India, rather than trying to complete remove emissions from our own economy as a priority.

How are we supposed to pay for this deal? Not to mention the vast amount of money spent on retrofitting millions and millions of buildings. It’s not feasible, practical, or anything like that.

We are the second biggest emitter in the world behind China. We are the wealthiest country in the world and should be leading the way in the global effort to decarbonize. Yes the green new deal will be expensive but I want you to think hard about what the costs will be of doing nothing. Don’t close your mind to this just because it doesn’t align with your political views. If we do nothing and pass 2 degrees of warming, there will be enormous economic consequences from flooding, drought, wildfires, dealing with millions of migrants, and inundation of coastal areas. The costs of dealing with these will be far greater than the cost of the green new deal.

If you keep going back, you will notice the temperature of the earth has already been where it is now lots of time before, and not only that, but on a cycle. This is because the sun goes through cycles, from more activity, to less activity. Right now we are on a higher end of sun activity. To only provide data since fossil fuels were used is extremely, let me repeat, extremely misleading to your audience, and by definition, misleading data and the way it has been presented is considered lying. Is the earth warming? yes. Is it something we can fix with money? No. If fossil fuels are the cause, why was there a huge deal about the earth going into an ice-age in the 70s? The evidence brought up is so subjective and is carefully selected to show a misleading cause to something that really isn&#39;t caused by it. <br />I certainly believe we should cut down on emissions so that our kids can live in a cleaner environment, but I believe it is foolish to think that we can fix a natural thing by giving more and more money to the government.

Everything you’ve said has been debunked countless times. Yes the Earth experiences natural changes in climate. This is clearly different. Never in recorded history have we seen warming at this rate, and it coincides directly with our pumping of billions of tons of CO2 into the atmosphere. Ask any paleo-climatologist what happens when more CO2 enters the atmosphere and they will tell you exactly the warming trend we are seeing now. In the Permian volcanoes released huge amounts of CO2 causing a runaway warming effect and resulting in the end Permian extinction. Trust the science bro not conspiracy videos.

One day we will have to pay for a clean breathable Air. <br /><br />The governments and the people around the world are not taking it seriously about the climate change. We all are running after wealth, but not understanding the fact that in order to enjoy wealth we need a good Environment. <br /><br />Fossil Fuel, Plastics, Massive breeding domestic animals for consumption, Harmfull perfume gases, Aircondition, Petroleum products and much more, needs to be stopped. We are not realizing the facts that we are addicted to all of this. <br /><br />If you really care about our planet please share ! Let&#39;s future generations be proud of us.

Scientists and science popularizers have been sounding the alarm. Carl Sagan devoted much of his 1980 tv show Cosmos to educating people about the dangers of the catalyzing effect of greenhouse gases on the stored energy in the earth system.<br /><br />Populists, corporate execs and willfully ignorant zealots have been profiting off ignoring those warnings. Those people are not just selfish and greedy, they&#39;re criminally negligent. They know full well they&#39;ve prioritized their own selfish short term gains over education, science funding and innovation for all. It&#39;s clear to see these people will get away with impunity.

We currently have zero safe storage sides that can guarantee hold the waste for thousands of years without anything leaking into the ground water - and our record of shooting stuff into space is mixed at best.. Nuclear fission might be a short term solution but long term we have to become renewable and the only way to go about that is pump money into research and development	UCtNjEiac_1FaizcVTCvp4tQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtNjEiac_1FaizcVTCvp4tQ	1	UgxQenPG40lTD3PwPgh4AaABAg	Terron .W

It can be a pain in many of the same ways our system is, for sure. For their sake, I wish they'd do this sort of thing too 💔 Also yes it would most likely partially come from our taxes but that amount would be significantly less than what we pay right now for healthcare. Technically, we could pay for MfA and way more with small taxes on the ultra rich but somehow that seems less likely in 2019...

What we need is to give companies tax incentives to build renewable sources of energy e.g Wind Turbines or Solar Panels, which the government can then buy the excess power at market rates. This passes the cost over to the companies, grows GDP, increases wages and probably give workers a well deserved bonus. The Green New Deal is a disaster and will ruin our future.

With 20 cubic meters of produce per TEU (allowing for space for refrigeration units), that is 3 kg CO2 per cubic meter, or 3 grams CO2 per liter of delivered volume. a 53' truck gets around 7 mpg and has space for around 85 cubic meters/85,000 liters (allowing for some inefficiency in loading and packaging). at 7 mpg, the truck will produce 1.7 kg of CO2 per mile, which would be 0.02 grams of CO2 per liter-mile. That means a truck traveling around 150 miles will create the same amount of CO2 for a given amount of delivered volume as a container ship traveling 5,300 miles. Conclusions: global travel distance is nearly irrelevant as long as you are near a port. Eat pineapples if you are near a port, otherwise stick with rhubarb By the way, you seem to be obsessed with pineapples; have you ever considered *rhubarb* might be in your future?

I understand we need to change, to conserve and protect the environment for ourselves and for future generations but if u force for a drastic change in such a short period of time, its gonna hurt millions in the present, unemployment, economic degradation,etc. To save the planet is the right direction but to move without concern for how fast u are going is to crash and burn. Work for attainable solutions, not just ideals. Ideals and words alone dnt squat if u dont have a feasible way to do it. That is the flaw off the green new deal. Doesnt have squant in policy of how to achieve its goals, the way to do it, and thats why many people call it crazy.

I don&#39;t subscribe to this paper&#39;s idea of also outlining how it should be done. It&#39;s to broad and mostly sounds like left wing politics to me. The issue of climate change should not be a left or right wing politics problem. Don&#39;t propose ideas that incorporate only left wing politics into the solution and the ideas will get more traction. jmho.

How much CO2 will that produce? How are we supposed to maintain these &quot;green&quot; structures once we transition off of fossil fuels? Furthermore, how much fossil fuel will be burned mining the metals and minerals to make these green structures? What are we supposed to burn for heat during winter? Are we still going to get tools and machined parts from factories, or will we all have to be blacksmiths? In addition to the above, I want to know how we will defend ourselves as a country. Will the military be exempt from the Green New Deal? These are some questions that I would like answers to. I do have more questions, but I don&#39;t want to leave a massive comment.

Once we are at 100% renewable we can build anything without burning fossil fuels. Homes will be electrically heated. Yes things will still be made in factories not by blacksmiths what kind of question is that lol. Those factories will just be powered by renewable energy.

That's the most generic and empty action that can ever be taken in politics. People ignore the Green New Deal because it's void of any substance. Work out the details before pushing forward a Utopian pipe dream, and then you'll get the attention you want. Among the many fantastical claims, I haven't heard one sane defense of "guaranteed government jobs". That bit gets a ton of heat and no one addresses it. Sure the rest of it gets flak for being unrealistic, but that one in particular gets flak for being completely antithetical to a healthy country. EDIT: It should also be mentioned that the Green New Deal sets deadlines for goals that have zero explanations on how to get there. That's not how a coherent plan works.

If the Green New Deal actually substantiated any of its solutions with some kind of plan, statistics, studies, _anything,_ then maybe we could get somewhere.

UgzHvXmtEozxoYmKGQp4AaABAg	0	6	2019-06-12 14:26:45	Michaell Tobiass	This video shows how not to combat climate change by mixing scientific facts and goals with ideological policy.<br /><br />Yes, we need to stop the global warming from exceeding 1.5 °C and get to net zero emissions by 2050 (not zero emissions it&#39;s net-zero which makes a huge difference with upcoming carbon capture and storing). This video and the supporters of the &quot;New Green Deal&quot; act like that their socialist policy is the only solution and everyone else is destroying the earth.<br /><br />What we need is a discussion across party lines about how we can archive the goals with different options.<br /><br />An alternative to central planning for every sector is giving CO2 a price to reduce CO2 in the cheapest way using market forces. This can be done by a carbon tax or even better by cap and trade where the maximum amount of CO2 emission is capped and split into certificates that companies can trade with each other. This way, emissions reductions are rewarded while the maximum amount of CO2 cannot exceed the cap, which is set by the government. This way would be so much more efficient than detail planning of technology by bureaucrats and policymakers. <br /><br />The second part of the Green New Deal is also full of socialist instruments like job-guarantees. Here investing in R&amp;D, education for adults or even introducing a universal basic income (which I’m not a fan of at all) are all alternatives worth being discussed.<br /><br />But by portraying their solution as the only viable option, they divide America in the “either you‘re with us or against us” fashion instead of having a nuanced discussion on which path is the best to stop global warming.

Nuclear fusion is by far the best method of getting energy that we should get it work properly immediately, it doesn't emit waste and very efficient (the fuel is sea water). It's just currently in the process of development so it still eats more energy than it emits energy	UCGr73h21FIp-6DOpqn22ErA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGr73h21FIp-6DOpqn22ErA	1	Ugzj66cPop9J_vvGn914AaABAg	emina huremovic

A solar panel pays off its embodied energy in something like 3-5 years; after that, every watt-hour is "clean" energy, for 2-5 decades. Not so with any form of power plant, because they consume fossil fuel directly or their fuel is produced using fossil fuels. Another advantage of solar power is that it mostly eliminates transmission losses since the power is produced where it's used. I believe up to 30% of the electricity from a big power plant is wasted as heat in transmission lines. Nothing is free, including solar panels, which are mostly made using fossil fuels, but I sure hope nobody is making the argument that we shouldn't use any form of "green" power if the equipment used to harvest the e energy is made using fossil fuels. That would be ridiculous.	UC7-68KVPsW-jKBmOcPnYSHg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7-68KVPsW-jKBmOcPnYSHg	1	Ugzj66cPop9J_vvGn914AaABAg	emina huremovic

A solar panel is only about 18% efficient but it has no moving parts and requires no fuel. A nuclear plant is maybe 60% thermally efficient, but it also has the long supply chain to mine and process the fuel for it, with every step costing energy. Normally I'd say that the waste issue is enough to keep me from being okay with nuclear power (I think the safety issues have been sorted out). But as severe as the climate change issue is, we need solutions right now, and nuclear is a good one. I know that it is just pushing the waste issue into the future but we won't have a future at all if we do nothing. I think fusion is such a game changer in so many ways that we should be dumping bazillions of dollars into it. But we should also be pouring resources into other things, in case fusion doesn't happen in time.

Nuclear or Fusion is way more practical for the future, rather than these "Green" sources. Nuclear isn't emitting co2 into our atmosphere, and fusion would bring on a way more powerful source of energy, but isn't looking like it will happen until 2050.

Ut doesn’t work like that. A government needs an incentive; they need an excuse to do something. Something like this wont work, the govs will just set a goal 50 years away because that means they don’t have to address it. Change needs to be slow and sure, we need men and women like the Elon Musks of the world to lead and pave the way through inviting innovation, because the old men set in their ways that lead us only see voter volatility and removing jobs removes votes, increasing tax on the needy increases risk etc.	UCBYb2iAzt2yqUZOAPSzqOwA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBYb2iAzt2yqUZOAPSzqOwA	0

This isn’t me being preachy but all of the statists show that cutting down consumption of meats and dairy products will have the largest impact on reducing climate change. I’m the UK for example, having everyone eat only two of their meals per week as vegetarian will have the same effects as taking every car off the roads in the UK. This can’t be ignored !

They have the bigger number in our government for now, but they don&#39;t have reached the 51% so they had to make a deal whit another minor party, they signed a contract that they are strictly following. But everyone in the old world and especially in European commisions are trying to take down the our government. <br />All the press is against this policy because they don&#39;t see how they can survive. The 5 stars movement is also cutting down the middle man in information and rappresentation using a Online Operative System based on blockchain security protocol, to esure citizens direc participation to information and democracy, doing regularelly online vote, and proposing law written and choosen directly by citizens like me. They are very clean in all their moves.<br /><br />Please U.S. peoples here that are supporting the green deal, brake the wall made up by fake news, and bad press, and keep one eye on Italy, we can help each other with experiences, knowledges and people power to make the world rise up from such a decisive moment in the history of mankind.<br /><br />All the blessings to you U.S. friends.<br /><br />Achille (from Italy)	UC7ha6JRdHDM2Bj3lYIHn0CA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7ha6JRdHDM2Bj3lYIHn0CA	0

But watching developing countries become developed suggests that this is not gonna happen. Likely we're going to bring another 2-4 billion omnivores online in the next few decades. If we can contain our damage to one geographical region it, at least, minimizes the harms caused by transportation and machine production. I'm mostly considering fruit/veg/leafy production, but animal production is similar. Transportation is a substantial fraction of the greenhouse gasses produced in agriculture. Small farms universally transport their food to market in small trucks (worst), big farms transport their food by large trucks (bad, but better), giant agro-facilities transport their food by rail (less bad, still not good). Using rail to transport our food is less damaging (per calorie or unit of nutrition) than dozens of small local farms all using F150s to get to market. We're in a position wherein nothing we do is "good", but we should aim for the least-bad solutions.

The problem is that you are failing to address exactly _why_ farming has such a massive imprint. The reason why food production has such a detrimental effect on the environment is because of the animals themselves. It has nothing to do with the tractors. We could in fact prohibit any use of tractors and farming/agriculture would still have the largest imprint by far. And unless combining all farms into gigantic farm reduces the demand for food (which it won't) that won't reduce the imprint either. In fact this will result in a net increase in greenhouse gases due to the increased global transportation of food. These are only a handful of the many flaws that would happen. It really doesn't seem like you have poured a lot thought into this one.	UCHoz54ceRou4NYcaZdupdyg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHoz54ceRou4NYcaZdupdyg	1	Ugz23kzJpSjpAScgu2V4AaABAg	Andy Lord

If we can use superfarms as opposed to regularfarms we can reduce the damage footprint caused by our (necessary) food production (per calorie of food produced). Simple things like purchasing fewer tractors, and containing fertilizer and pesticide runoff to one area. Economics of scale kick in pretty effectively for farming. Some foods make sense to grow locally and ship to stores on truck, but trucks themselves are atrocious for our environment. Trains are much more environmentally efficient.

The reason they are good is because they actually make infrastucture that doesn't need to run on gasoline or other fuels of that type, and could potentially help with things like storing energy for green power sources when the car is not in use. Electric cars ARE not the perfect solution at all, but they could become a lot better in the future, so in that way - the more the better.

I know the social issues must also be addressed to help deal with the economic issues related to the reduction of carbon output, but to start with at least there should be a middle ground found on the social end to help the environmental focused issues to get going ASAP rather than bundling it with social issues more controversial to the Republicans, then focus the social issues to boost environmental ones at a later date. This way a climate focused bill can be passed sooner rather than later with the economic issues coming later to provide a boost and a good all round change.

The kind of change it requires scares the hell out of those who feel like their comfortable position of power is threatened, so they close their eyes, bury their heads in the sand and deny there&#39;s even a problem at all. Make you so mad you see red? There&#39;s only one way to fix it and get others to see it clearly. Get 2020 vision. See blue. Vote blue.

This will obviously dismantle the whole of the middle class pushing them well into poverty, and the already poor starving on the streets.<br /><br /><br />What an amazing idea, it would make the great leap forward during china communism which killed some 45 million people in a few years look very humane.

Local products where the first step, but i think that we need local JOBS. why should we buy our stuff from china, while we have structure selfe? I am european living in europe and rope is tighting up around our necks, while we have already good emisions. There is no talking about to green the city up, help the comunity or anything else. <br /><br />They have a point. The climate is extreme, but the way they where doing it is just not good. i mean we where using lithium and stuff like that, but it needs a high amount of energy to produce that. And many work is just there to push digital money around the world wich is also require much energy. <br /><br />If we keep the ways closer, if we work in closed comunitys, we could change it.

Also, it should be forbidden to ship goods in trucks all across the world. High speed rail for both people and goods is necessary instead of planes. The price of meat needs to rise drastically to get people to stop eating it, because that&#39;s the only way that will really make a change in the behavior of consumers. Gas prices also need to be driven up by carbon taxes to promote the usage of public transport, and such systems need to be built in the first place, especially in the US to be convenient and cheap for everyone. From a CEO of a company to a school janitor. And so much more..., a shame that the ones that will be retired by the time the planet falls to pieces are the ones dictating the rules and laws about how we should act today.

Also, in all seriousness, it would be VERY good if all of mankind's eggs weren't in the same basket. Once we get a significant number of people living off the Earth with enough infrastructure to support them if something really bad were to happen here mankind could go on, and there might even be resources from off the Earth to help us recover.

I have wrote two more comments, but hey, let me answer based on my first comment. I am all for scientific endeavours, and first "wave colonialism", which is in fact putting humans on Mars, but bringing them back. "Second wave colonialism", i.e. establishing a base which operates for a few years is too much right now, especially when we have such a serious situation on Earth. And no, low gravity is not the biggest problem. The lethally toxic Martian soil, full with perchlorate, and the radioactive erosion of solar winds would force any colony to dig under the Martian regolith in order to establish a proper base. Right now, humanity needs to battle with its own degrading atmosphere, not with another planet's environment. And you shouldn't start with " people like you". You don't know what do I expect from space research. Personally, in the XXIth century I would like to see us establishing a base on the Moon, for four reasons: - Obviously, to explore it inside and out. - To put a space observatory on it. -To later establish a refuelling station between Earth and future Mars colonies. - And very importantly, to mine helium-3, which is thought to have a natural abundance in the upper layer of the regolith. He-3 - deuterium combination is the second approach (after sole deuterium fusion) to fuel our future Fusion powerplants. Fusion power generation - if everything goes well - can save humanity by serving its huge energy hunger, with clear power generation. Fingers crossed for ITER. For some reason our extravagant billionaires are seem to be uninterested in helping us to reach this technological level. They are preoccupied with the dreams of space factories, and terraforming other planets. At least this is what they sell. Space populism, and scientific demagogy. In a nutshell: Don't terraform or colonise other planets, when our home becomes uninhabitable. Terraform other planets after we save Earth. P.S.: And by the way, with our current technology it is easier to reach Venus, and we could establish a flying base above its cloud-layer about right now. Why don't we do it? Because why would we? We need to prioritize. That is why colonising Mars should come only later, after we solve the problems back in home. Because without a supply line back to home, a Martian colony is doomed.

Similar types said the moon was just as pointless, and yet it brought us into the modern era and we are going back. Space and interplanetary living is just another challenge that we can overcome given time. The biggest problem with Mars isn't the things you have mentioned it's actually the gravity. Long term low gravity is uncharted territory but shouldn't be used as an excuse to never even try. Go stick your head back in the sand.

The Earth has triple of the ideal population and because of that, causes the problems mentioned in the video, climate change, poverty, etc. Mass genocide (preferably half the population) could be a simple solution but is not heavily favoured by anyone (even me), it is just not logical. At least with something such as a 0 child policy will slowly decrease the population by not adding more people to Earth to balance the people that have died. I dont know about you guys but just reply to my comment to share your thoughts with me and othwr people.

He just ignores this task, which would be the first thing to do for any terraforming civilisation. And right now building such a big and powerful machine which orbits Mars, exists only as a theoretical study (how to change its lethaly toxic perchlorate-rich soil is anybody's guess though). Still, we have a home planet to save first. Scientific achievements, and first wave colonisation is all right, but the fantasy of terraforming and second wave colonisation must be put on hold in order to turn our collective's attention towards the real task at hand: To save humanity's home. Because Earth will be still here in the future, but maybe without us. Now people should join forces sure, but what happens to us, when billionares with enough infulance are looking outwards from Earth? When Bezos wants to build space factories, Musk wants to build Martian colonies?

If I would be able, I would tell him it's 4 billion years late for us to live on Mars. That is when the planet's internal dynamo cooled, lost its magnetosphere, and then lost its atmosphere. Sure, maybe you can terraform it through hundreds of years, but the atmosphere you generate will be totally lost again. Mars is a toxic wasteland, blown dry by radioactive solar flares, and its low gravity can be turn out to be harmful for human physique. I would ask Elon to turn his attention towards Earthly things, but do it with responsibility. We don't need bombastic inventions which don't work, or can't even have a meaningful purpose in battling climate change. Daydreaming about space fleets and multi-planetary humanity in the near future is just escapism in a drag.

They are the inclination of the earth axis and the distance of the earth to the sun. Unlike most people believe the inclination of earth axis can change over time. Curently we live in a cold age since our northern and southern pole are still frozen. Every 100 thousand years or so the epoches turn from warm ages to cold ages and the other way around. Since It's a generell trend it can be argued that climate change is inevitable and is rather a question of time.

In my country, Germany, there have been school strikes for better climate policies every friday for about 6 months and in that time the green party has gone from 10% in the last national election to 19% and second strongest party in the elections for the european parliament. In current surveys the rank even higher at 26% and strongest party, which has never happened before.

By the way, IQ isn’t actually a very good measure of intelligence, and it doesn’t even try to measure whether or not someone has useful skills. And in case you didn’t know, literally running out of space isn’t the problem with refugees or immigrants, running out of resources and money is.

Solar panels are very good during the day but not the evening 5pm and after when everyone is home and most energy is used, not considering the stormy areas of the us and Alaska. So the only way that solar power could be achieved is a mix with nuclear which is not net 0 therefore is not allowed. Just to mention wind power is not efficient and is very random, and hydroelectric destroys natural eco systems so is a step in the wrong direction. Not only is it unfeasible but unethical as what if someone says no to letting you change there building, or a gas company says they won’t stop pumping oil they will just sell it. If touch there property the us would now be an authoritarian country, where the citizens rights are ignored.	UC2y6XkYbqGGByTYpkopNOhw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2y6XkYbqGGByTYpkopNOhw	0

I am sorry that I have to remain skeptical, your reporters have a long history of distorting the truth and outright lying. I can&#39;t really trust their claims until I can establish their actual expertise. Many times governments have placed unelected bureaucrats into positions that they had absolutely no expertise in. Most often, the actual best scientists in a given field are not talking heads, but rather working in industry or perhaps their own independent goals.

Hear me out: the massive government spending would a) crowd out private investment, meaning new companies would not be able to obtain funding because of higher interest rates (this is the crowding out effect); and b) cause investors to lose faith in the US government as they realize that the dent accrued is unlikely to be paid back. America is one of the stalwarts of global commerce, and a loss of faith in the USD would cause a massive contraction in the money supply. <br /><br />TL;DR, we&#39;re screwed either way.

According to new research, the rise is largely courtesy of China and India. A study by NASA, based on extensive satellite imagery and published in the journal Nature Sustainability, has revealed that the two countries with the world's biggest populations are also responsible for the largest increase in green foliage. Since the turn of the new millennium, the planet's green leaf area has increased by 5%, or over two million square miles. That's an area equivalent to the sum total of the Amazon rainforests, NASA says. But researchers stressed that the new greenery does not neutralize deforestation and its negative impacts on ecosystems elsewhere. A third of the leaf increase is attributable to China and India, due to the implementation of major tree planting projects alongside a vast increase in agriculture. "China and India account for one-third of the greening, but contain only 9% of the planet's land area covered in vegetation -- a surprising finding, considering the general notion of land degradation in populous countries from overexploitation," Chi Chen, the study's lead author and a graduate researcher at Boston University's Department of Earth and Environment, said in a statement.

Cost is not the problem, SUNKEN cost is! All these companies care for, is to sustain their operation and continue to make a profit. It's like a bus stuck on the gas pedal, it just won't want to come to a stop. You have to fight it until you have either stopped it and saved the world or crashed it and we're doomed.

We also have nuclear energy, but environmentalists don't wanna do that either. Solar panels also create emissions and expire over time, meaning they have to be renewed in 20yrs, time, Wind Energy is only limited to certain areas and can cause ecological damage as well	UCzK0DDaW0_3bInPy6hxNKsw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzK0DDaW0_3bInPy6hxNKsw	1	UgxqU6bfl5DhNalieuV4AaABAg	BaronZ

Renewables just need a facility to be built and then a few people to maintain it. To get it to other places all you need are power lines which are very cheap to make.

But climate change, as the video says stop all emissions, if nuclear is ever seen is the most immediately viable, that at least doesn't produce green house gasses. But it all just comes down to one mane thing as I see it. Someone and then everyone together actually just getting something done instead of all the fighting over "if" it's the right thing. Inaction is 100% more worse than no action or even a bad or terrible action.

As soon as they discover a material that even when a meltdown occurs that the danger and un reversible possibilities are reduced or even Neil and void people will probably start looking at nuclear as a more substantial possibility.

On the storage subject you contradict yourself : either we don't have the possibility to store electricity or we does have the possibility and it's co² emissions isn't worth it for now. I think the storage problem can be resolved by changing the way we use electricity more than the way we produce it. For example, the mining of lithium could be much more clean if we used electricity for the machines. A massive fleet of EVs could be used (by smartly recharging) to dampen the peaks and notch of renewable electricity. Thats just some example of change of behaviour that we someday would have to apply anyway, so why not now ? We need to keep in mind that changing our everyday life is inevitable : even in France where 80% of electricity comes from a very clean nuclear power, most of the energy consumption comes from oil. nuclear power won't help much as long as we don't build nuclear cars and nuclear industial machines.

That takes into account the co² emission of building solar panels, wind turbine and nuclear powerplant and the emissions of extracting, transporting and processing of uranium. the efficiency of renewable energy can vary greatly (between 3 and 22 gCO²/kWh for wind and 49 to 60gCO²/kWh in France) while nuclear vary around 16 (6 for France wich doesn't use the same processing technique than usa and japan). That said, the co² emission of steel and solar panel is mostly due to the use of electricity to heat the ore : with clean electricity production, solar electricity become even more efficient. I'm not sure about IFR, but melted sodium reactor were really hype a while ago and didn't find it's way to global use. I think if we don't use a technology it's mostly because it's not ready. Even if there is a part of the nuclear wastes recycled, it's just a small delay. Nuclear energy can be a very good way to reduce emission on a short term, but i think it's not likely to be the main energy source of the future.

You are fully aware that there is no international agency with enough power to provide a solution on a worldwide scale. So if we want to preserve what's left of confort in our environment, the decision to act should come from countries. I think the usa isn't just any country among the others. The usa have a lot of economical and political power, even among the richests country in the world, its viewed as a driving force to follow. So i think the usa has the power to devellop itself out of fossil dependency and drive everyone toward more efficient society. But with great power comes great responsability. You talked about china and india, i assume you think the usa share responsability with those country. i think its obscene of you to say this while the usa is still the biggest CO² emmitter. Comparing a slow development country with others that just finished their demographic transition is a nonsense. Nobody (and especially not the gnd) is asking the usa to save everyone, just to pay its share.

However, planes are still extremely important. Like I said, they are important when it comes to commuting people long distances, and transporting cargo. Sure, y’all may have high speed trains in Europe, but here in America, no high speed train can, or ever will exist simply due to the fact that cities are so far apart with lots of rural land, and the overall size of America is equal to that of Europe. Very few people realize this, but the reason why America can never look like Europe is because America is one country, while Europe has a multitude of different countries and governments, of which can maintain their own small areas. That means, the creation of high speed trains is much easier in Europe because each country doesn’t have to go as far with their trains, as say in America. Now, let’s also look at the fact that planes are also important when it comes to traveling overseas. There is no way a train could be built over an ocean, or a boat fast enough to compete with planes. Do planes emit a lot of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere? Sure, but there is no known solution, and likely never will be a solution, that replaces airplanes.

Aside from being used in helping research and improve our society (NASA in itself has contributed more to the economy than any other government agency. In fact, it’s a net positive from NASA when it comes to financial gain), rockets are used to send satellites into space, and I don’t need to tell you how important those are.

Henry Ford had worked with George Washington Carver about fueling his vehicles but we found out that we could use the runoff from kerosene to fuel our cars...and it was CHEAPER. We’re not so dependent on oil and gas as you thought. It’s just business, a very lucrative business that keeps this going. I know there will be some people that will disagree and you have that right. But look around you, it’s only June here in South Texas and we’re setting records that we’re set only a couple years ago. Stop following the 3% of those scientists, there probably backed by big money, that why we hear more from them than the others.

In fact, it takes more land to build a solar farm that produces the same amount of energy as nuclear, and still provides no wildlife refuge around it. Most of the land nuclear takes up is actually wildlife preservation. Oh, and since you think nuclear fuel extraction is dangerous for the environment, the materials used to create panels, windmills, and the batteries for these two energy sources is far more dangerous than a relatively stable radioactive isotope (long half life = less dangerous). Interesting anecdote that shows the importance of nuclear and baseload energy, back in December of 2017, North Carolina got hit with a huge cold spell and tons of snow. For a period of time, only coal and nuclear were providing energy to the grid because natural gas was being sent to homes for warmth, there was no sun for solar panels to work, the rivers were frozen, and wind was nonexistent. This anecdote I bring us shows the importance of baseload energy, and how solar and wind can never accomplish it, while nuclear, which has an uptime of over 90% (downtime is usually due to refueling, maintenance, and tests), can and will provide the baseload.

Compare 300 years ago When seas where colder on the north in the tropic of cancer. Those who live in the himalayas depend on glacier for water, now imagine you live there waking up one hot morning hearing the news on your town that snow in the mountains were gushing down... Also the earth has been shifting climate temperatures even before then so its normal, the problem is it's too fast.

However, I will also say that the US had plenty of chances in the past where it could begin reversing the problems with climate change while it was still economically sound. So, now, you&#39;re gonna have to pay, not just in dollars, but in time lost as well. Be grateful that right now, at the very least, there&#39;s a price tag. Because if you don&#39;t fund this, you may reach a point where even money can&#39;t save you. And when you reach that point, all you will be able to do is hope that God can save you, because you have no choice, no time, and no resources left.

I don't think you have a grasp on how much society will crumble as a result. It goes far beyond uncomfortable, it is the deaths of potentially billions. Those who survive would be living in a much different world, many luxuries, technologies, services and even foods we enjoy will likely disappear.

But it's only really needed for petrochemicals. Lubricants, plastics, etc. We'll kind of need it for planes for a long time too, but then most plane travel is not a necessity, so if we make that choice we can cut it. Anyway, using oil for petrochemicals is not a big problem for emissions. So that's not a big problem anyway. We don't need to require burning oil. For everything we do, except planes, we have alternatives, and they're rapidly becoming the cheaper alternative. By some measures, EVs are already cheaper in total cost of ownership compared to gasoline cars.

You do it by using the same tools we're using elsewhere: renewable electricity and electrification. The biggest reason why this extraction causes emissions is because the mining equipment, processing facilities and logistics run on fossil fuels. So by using the same technology we've developed in cars, and now trucks and ferries (battery electric and hydrogen electric) in mining, we cut those emissions. This is already well underway. In fact, the worlds largest electric vehicle is a dump truck! The worlds largest dump truck is a hybrid. Some mines have also started using equipment which is simply hooked up to grid electricity. The Swedish mining equipment manufacturer Epiroc has announced that it will be electrifying its entire lineup in the next 5 years.

Unless you have some kind of solution (technological or otherwise) for negative emissions. (Or a mix of both, of course.) Deforestation/afforestation is indeed one of the things required at this point to stay below 1.5 degrees of warming. It wouldn't have been if we had begun the mitigation efforts in earnest 10, 20, 30 years ago.

Which is why this video is pure fantasy. Your entire argument relies on a false belief that renewables can easily replace oil and gas currently. It's such a bad argument I suggest getting an education on how energy industry works or basic maths and science. Oil is specifically is used because it's more efficient. Renewables aren't consistent sources of energy or even reliable at this stage.	UCj3mlzGds0Z6jMEqfgr3Rsw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj3mlzGds0Z6jMEqfgr3Rsw	1	UgyrlHLudlmJ59P-aAl4AaABAg	Steve

At the moment it's mostly car manufacturers paying out for these points anyway, and if they have customers buying up their cars in rural areas then they will have incentive (as they are doing) to provide charging points in those areas. Both private companies and the state can quite easily and without much cost, work together to ensure that everywhere is well serviced proportionate to the need of those areas.

Assuming you did, charging times at the lowest voltage from empty to full on a prius (which isn't most situations, most of the time it's partial to full) are under 3 hours, and you can halve that by upping the voltage, which most people would spend at work, or shopping, or at home, or with friends. On a tesla model S it's 1 hour from 0, and only 20 minutes to charge to half. It's very unlikely that if you've got an electric car and an area well serviced with charging points (and there's more and more points installed every month), that you're going to be left stranded.

Honestly, yeah, we need to push for all of this (and also build a fucking energy-producing tokamak already), but I&#39;m almost certain it&#39;s not going to happen. At least not through the normal political process and not fast enough. And then again, even if you guys achieve it in USA, there&#39;s still the rest of the world, including China and India. Do your best and prepare for the worst, I guess. The current system is incapable of implementing such large-scale changes in any meaningful amount of time.

The bottom line is that we need dramatic change quickly and that we need to rethink this issue, not always couching it in the neoliberal capitalist nonsense that has stifled progress on this for decades. If you could share the excerpts of the specific part you are talking about, I think that would be helpful. Money is an attempt to put a specific value on abstract and subjective things. We try to be objective when assigning monetary value to things but fact is that it's a construct. If we think about this in the same old ways, it will never be immediately profitable or fundable and that means more precious time lost waffling.

Maybe rather than talking about conspiracies it might be helpful to share primary or secondary sources that back up your assertion since it seems to be your goal to educate the rest of us. All I know is that it goes against everything I was taught in my astronomy, paleo, and ecology classes on this subject. I am just not terribly invested in arguing in YouTube comments at this time because I'm well aware that people know how to throw around a few related terms about Milankovitch cycles or a paper about a particular portion of the Antarctic ice sheet possibly gaining some mass in order to foster skepticism towards something the vast majority of publishing climate scientists agree on. The conspiracy or creating guilt exists to what end? And what of the profit motive of massive corporations built on nonrenewable energy sources and the motive of those who simply don't wish to change their way of life and take whatever they can to assuage their guilt?

The land ice is the ice that is formed by snowfall over thousands of years. I.e. permanent ice. The sea ice freezes and melts every years as the seasons change. Yes there has been a measured increase in sea ice formation but as it melts every year it has no consequence on climate or sea levels. The Orbital Forcing you reference is an old theory of one scientist and while it does hold a small amount of merit, it is generally considered to not be the cause of sea ice formation but rather a small piece in the large puzzle of climate science. Scientists now have the understanding that other geological functions such as tectonic plate activity and the hole in the southern ozone layer are the primary causes of the increase in the yearly sea ice formation and subsequent melting which, as stated, bears no significance in climate change.

We will have to use fossil fuels to mine those new materials, build the buildings. It will increase the cost of living, it will destroy many dairy jobs. Wisconsin will be hit hard by this because so many of them are dairy farmers. It will put us in 93 trillion dollars of debt. It’s a socialist takeover.

Not all countries try to plant after they cut down. We live in an age where almost all land areas are occupied. Tree plantations take alot of space. We need to do other things with that space. Also the age between a seed being planted and being fully grown is multiple years. It’s really hard to explain and to write all the negatives. However i can assure you that it’s not that simple. Sure it’s still a great Idea to plant more trees but that won’t be nearly enough.

Trees will collect those two and create Glucose and Oxygen, which we alongside other creatures eat and breathe in. Etc so this photosynthesis is natural. The CO2 % Will remain around 0,038%. However when animals and plants Die and remain under the surface for millions of years and become fossil fuel and we burn then, that Will add CO2 to the natural 0,038%.

The only advantage to it is 0 is the freezing point of water and 100 the boiling point, which is cool if you’re boiling water, but not for anything else. Kelvin is a proper measurement of temperature. Kelvin’s zero is absolute zero, not the freezing point of something random. More importantly is that Kelvin is exact, so 2 degrees is twice as hot as 1 degrees. In Celsius, 273 degrees is twice as hot as 0, which isn’t even the coldest that things can get. Completely random.

Subtract 10% of that number. Add 32 to it to get Farenheit. So 20C becomes 40. 40-4 = 36. 36+32 = 68F. Do the opposite to go from F to C: 86F - 32 = 54. 54 + 6 (or 5) = 60. Half of 60 is 30C.

So at 0F we feel as if their is no heat at all and we can’t tolerate it. At 100F it’s way too hot and we can’t tolerate it. So between 0 and 100 we can tolerate it with the correct standard clothing without screaming “we need to get inside somewhere”	UCoIF6s3gRY8_c5YXgGQ0H9Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoIF6s3gRY8_c5YXgGQ0H9Q	1	Ugx2AllgDX9o5_v7ujx4AaABAg	CB

I can't relate to that). But as a rule of thumb, yours is a good way of understanding Fahrenheit, provided you don't live in a cold place. Thank you, never though of it that way.

So not hot at all. Where as 80F =80% heat and that’s pretty hot. 100F =100% and that is about as much as we can take in a healthy way.

I’m a chemical engineer and besides consistency in labs and calculations, there’s nothing inherently bad about using Fahrenheit for measure ambient temperature. You could argue that it’s even better for representing air temperature because it has a larger interval of integers; obviously you can add decimals in between the Celsius scale but that doesn’t really help since a person can’t accurately distinguish the difference between say 15C and 15.5C. Celsius is useful for calculations with liquid water, since the boiling and freezing point are at a reasonable 100 degrees and 0 degrees.

I didn't do the math and I wrote it down too quickly; I was totally wrong there. This is the actual increase in Fahrenheit as given to me by @Cars by Chris and my own calculation to verify: So, you know 0 °C = 32 °F? Well, 0.5 °C equals 32.9 °F. Where I went wrong is saying an increase of 0.5 °C was a big number (32.9 °C) when, in actuality, an increase of 0.5 °C is only 0.9 °F, when you subtract 32 °F from 32.9 °F. Again, *0.9 °F* is the actual increase and NOT 32.9 °F. Sorry for the confusion! [As much as I would like to have a shared use of one unit of measurement, you would have to think of the common man in the US who doesn't know it. It would be better to explain it in those terms, stating how we've already gone +1.5 °C, an increase of 34.7 °F. Only an additional increase of: .5 °C = 32.9 °F Is what this vid's talking about, and we're on our way to go past it if nothing is sacrificed to get the temperature back in order.]	UCcdRB1_Ko7MfEgpoEQPawZQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcdRB1_Ko7MfEgpoEQPawZQ	1	Ugx2AllgDX9o5_v7ujx4AaABAg	CB

People would rather lose their jobs in order to save Earth than to contribute to destroying Earth working a polluting job.<br />EDIT: The video is indeed about American policy. I&#39;m just baffled by how people (anywhere in the world) can think their wallet is more important than saving the planet. In the Nordics we are close to nature and that is probably why we are leaders in renewable energy and transport electrification, but Sweden is far from green.

A lot of Nordic GDP comes from fossil fuels though, and the considerably high human development index in Nordic countries allows for them to focus on environmental policy more. Not saying we shouldn't follow the Nordic example, but a lot of what has been done in the Nordic nations is because they're wealthy and so they shouldn't be so morally righteous about it.

Here in Ireland there have been calls to reduce the size of the national herd, to reduce emissions and of course the farming lobby has come out against it. People mostly don't vote green party here either because they are worried about huge increases on taxes like motor tax and VAT on fuel and particularly huge carbon taxes. people are simply not willing to make the substantial changes nesssecary because it's too much of an adjustment for them.

Everthing that is here on earth has to reach chemical equilibrium . “Le Châtelier’s principle can be stated as: When a system at equilibrium is subjected to change in concentration, temperature, volume, or pressure, then the system readjusts itself to (partially) counteract the effect of the applied change and a new equilibrium is established.”  Without going so far into science climate change is the earth's response and adjustment to gases emitted.

The mass migration you're talking about doesn't necessarily have to be to the US or Europe, who's to say we don't end up with dry lands migrating into Africa, south America or Asia? All I stated was not using coal (main supplier of electricity) and cutting fossil fuels (cutting industry & transportation of food and goods) isn't a viable option. The solution will likely be a technological one (as it's always been in history) where we can filter our pollutants out of the air or stop creating them all together (like a catalytic converter of sorts)	UC32itzQPatjNnjmBlYWOjrQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC32itzQPatjNnjmBlYWOjrQ	1	Ugzlh71cD7wgna3FUQ94AaABAg	Elvin Valentin

This plan will go against a lot of what republicans want, with he main problem being big government. There is no way to achieve this without a large governing body to ensure it works properly.

But the truth is that our planet has went through several glacial eras, way before humans were there, there was also 5 mass extinctions before. I personally believe humankind is doing harm to the planet, just to throw that out of the window, but you can't really call out people that are questioning it. It wouldn't be the first time scientists make mistakes, heck, in America cigarettes were advertised as healthy and a sign of manliness by doctors. In the end whether you're a republican or a democrat, that you trust in climate change or not, what are you exactly doing for the planet ? Everyone is acting like they're aware of what's going on, that WE should fight, but no one's doing anything, because the only way would be to lower of quality of life, and only a handful of people are willing to do that. People bragging on social media saying how they're so righteous and virtuous because they share some edgy random facts about how we are slowly killings our planet doesn't accomplish anything, besides maybe.. actually harming the planet by using energy to post it on social media. That's plain hypocrisy if you ask me.	UCE_oJXKiOsiGC00kk1DQeZw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE_oJXKiOsiGC00kk1DQeZw	1	UgyYCVqm2uMuW4eCKqB4AaABAg	Roman D. Uchiha

There are a lot less stupider things to cut than defense. You could start with cutting pay to politicians and cut foreign aid altogether, our tax dollars should go to things that directly improves the lives of Americans and not foreign nations.

Before the industrial revolution the avarage temperature was even going down a bit with the 14th till 18th century even being reffered to as the Little Ice Age. Because of the cooler climate around that time a lot of harvests failed which might even has caused the French Revolution. But after 1830, the start of the Industrial Revolution, you can see the temperature on earth rapidly going up. That is because taht was when we started using fossil fuels. Scientists can look at ice from gletsjers in Antarctica that contains air molecules from when the ice was formed. In that htey can see that the amount of CO2 in the air has increased since the 1830's at the same time the temperature started to go up and the Industrial Revolution began. Scientists can also see that the extra amount of CO2 is not created by volcanoes, because they haven't erupted more or less in the last 200 years than they did before the last 200 years.

Basically it runs jobs, ruins the livelihood of millions of people putting them out of work, and somehow doing all these things in the next 10 or so years? So I guess in the end the cost of us "saving the planet" will be: the U.S. goes bankrupt, millions out of work, starving, and a lot of people probably dying not able to find a job that fits their profession they had before, and even more trillions of dollars in debt. Sounds great, I mean we made a slight difference right? Even though Inda and China create more pollution 10 fold. Yeah great plan.

Maybe we should start with China And India 2 of largest pollution causing nations in the world. Let’s hold them to our standards. Tired of hearing how bad we are as a nation what about the rest of the world. Why can’t they help out save the world. We are all in this together. Right? That’s what I have been hearing all year long. Put your mask help save others. Stop fossil fuels. Well We need the rest of the world to step there game up on this issue tired of it.

Electricity isnt a game changer unfortunately, at least not until scientists figure out how to make a better battery. Nuclear remains our best option presently. Windmills cause too much damage on ecosystems and fusion is the next best thing. Now, we could change our diets. Take out beef and cows and we can reduce carbon emissions. Help India with greener solutions that's an option, because India is currently going towards coal and thats too many people to be burning coal. I think our biggest problem lies not in our politicians but with ourselves. Many of the people I hear cry for the future and change I do not see them change. The biggest challenge is everyone wants the freedom to live their life, but also to live it well later while someone else finds a solution now. Be the change you want to see.

China has tripled its renewable energy and found a safer way to use nuclear energy which makes it more effective and near impossible to Chernobyl. Also though still increasing there middle class has decreased the average carbon footprint of the citizens. Also, the have reforested the most land. Also, they just passed a new law where the heavily restricted skyscraper construction and encourage green eco-friendly and traditional architecture. Now china not perfect but the reason china and India have pollution problems is that they have a billion people and half of all people in the world live in that region.

Though, in the end climate change will cost a lot more then what it will cost to save the earth. Think about all those migrants, countries under water, millions of people losing jobs maybe even a billion people will lose their jobs, earth will be destroyed and we won’t survive unless we establish colonies outside of earth. In case that happens only a limited amount of people will survive. Or we could just save the earth before it gets destroyed it’s your choice, but it will effect everyone else	UC6pSRkOkEIxd0HGcczMtexw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6pSRkOkEIxd0HGcczMtexw	1	UgwyqQYfFpbFtZODrDR4AaABAg	Karl Kastor

Hydroelectric tide power uses ocean tides (very consistent and predictable, runs 24h a day, many coastlines around the world) to generate electricity, with minimal environmental impacts. Nuclear fusion could be crucial in a clean energy strategy, generating vast amounts of energy with no nuclear waste and in a safer process than fission, not to mention all of the other technology currently in development. It is inevitable that clean energy will plummet in price, it just isn't cheap enough yet for it to be feasible economically.

Their way of thinking is not rational rather it is based on what's more to gain than to lose. They only thought that there's only little to gain and more to lose. What's worse is that they put that stupidity into the minds of the people, destroying the hope of a new future. Our future depends on the hope and determination of those who are willing to change it. Our ways of perceiving the situation and adressing it(if we really are adressing it) should change by starting to talk about it to people. We should tell them that there's something that could be done, we need more minds to make better solutions, and we need to do that quickly(as fast as the wind blows in a storm). Look, whatever we do right now is based on our choices and the choices that we make and know are generated by what we believe in. And, what we "believe" in, impacts our way of thinking. So, if we don't think and perceive this in the right way, RIGHT NOW, then............... we might regret it in the future. @Karl Kastor that quote will be what everyone will say in the future, if we don't change now. We are fools for granted considering there are solutions that can be made, only if we take action on them RIGHT NOW. Just remember this: Climate change doesn't just change the climate, it will also change us. But, believe it or not, if we deny it, we might not make the change that our planet and our people need. To be a little bit direct, We don't make the change, CHANGE MAKES US.	UC_LRAUeMrKTyYUb6tQZYfEw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_LRAUeMrKTyYUb6tQZYfEw	1	UgwyqQYfFpbFtZODrDR4AaABAg	Karl Kastor

Because it has been increasing since we have left mini ice age a few hundreds ago. This graph is manipulative as the predictions which with over 100 models has been for decades now- off the predictions. There has been 1 which was predicting increase of temp and co2 right. You know which one is it? Russian. In spite of that UN or any other organisation uses only model that works and predicts corectly for over 20 years. Noone says that either. Sorry but new energy sources are for rich countries to keep status quo and send message that poor countries need to be poor for another 30 years. Because its not coal and oil that keeps those countries alive . Now they need to be dependant on countries with technology.

It’s also arguably the most progressive — pushing for the US to have a carbon-free economy by 2050.

Machines that are created with technology that eliminated carbon emissions must be made with the intention of being operated by a human worker wether a maintenance person or technition or operator or all of the above and this won't be possible unless there is government legislation that requires corporations to do this and it needs to be decided on what is viable for this. Jobs that replace older and dirtier jobs must also be required to hire anyone ether with open door policy with intention to do on the job training or to hire people with similar or as equivilant in nature experience and must be required to pay for schooling if necessary all wich will require government intervention. Any attempt to convert a economy and industry will require big brother to intervene on behalf of citizens and this does mean that 200 years of Laza Fare will have to be set aside at least for the time it takes to make the transition and if America can keep the gears turning with minimal turbulence and can prevent corruption then these are some of the solutions for the average worker to not feel it as much.

I was talking about renewable energy sources being a better long term energy source than nuclear or fossil fuels - that is a fact. How we generate energy from these renewable energy sources will change over time. Computers use to be the size of a room and do nothing more than simple calculations. Technology improves. Yes the production of solar panels produces toxic materials, but solar panels can be recycled, although it is currently difficult. Current solar panel technology is just one of many different renewable energy sources. The real issue with your argument is it puts toxic waste on the same level as nuclear waste, which is absurd at best. Nuclear waste is a sub set of toxic waste. Toxic waste means it's harmful to humans or the environment if not recycled or disposed of properly. To put this into perspective, the device you are using right now will become toxic waste at the end of its life. Lots of toxic waste can be reused, recycled or disposed of easily with current technology. Nuclear waste on the other hand remains dangerous to humans and the environment for hundreds of thousands of years until it is no longer radioactive. Meaning humanity has to put it somewhere safe and guard it until that time. Even if you could design a nuclear power plant that you could 100% guarantee would never go into meltdown you'd still need to put all the nuclear waste from it somewhere - that's why it's only a short term solution to the problem of fossil fuels and energy usage.

Nuclear may be a good short term fix. But it still produces hazards to our environment and humanities safety, which have to be constantly managed. Did you know that designers of nuclear waste long term storage have to take into account for the pressure build up of gasses inside the storage unit - if they are designed poorly they could explode. Generations from now we might find out about design defects in a very bad way. That's the way you have to think about nuclear, you don't have to do that with solar or wind.

Nitrogen fertilizer is one of many types of fertilizer. Switching fertilizer would be an easy fix. Also there are other ways to produce Nitrogen fertilizer that do not involve natural gas. Your argument is a bit like saying "lots of people drive, when oil runs out are you going to be able to drive". To which I am saying "Yes, in an electric car". Just because lots of people do it, doesn't mean it's right or the best thing to do, or even the only thing you can do.

The military spending is excessive I know but the reason both sides of the aisle support it is because it does help the economy as a side-effect by providing jobs in manufacturing and so on. Plus it is small compared to the estimated costs of the Green New Deal. The Green New Deal is estimated to cost between $51 trillion to the outrageous $93 trillion (this upper bound is disputed) over ten years. If we just go with $51 trillion, then that is $5.1 trillion each year. The US government is not able to generate that kind of money each year. That is why the government goes into debt each year to make up the rest to fund itself. Also, if I am not mistaken, the $5.1 trillion is just for the Deal and NOT for the rest of government spending. Therefore you can approach the $8-$10 trillion a year bill. I am sure some spending/funding can overlap to reduce the overall bill but not by much. So it is true that we just cannot afford it. It is like if you really need a house to live in but cannot afford it, what happens? You don’t buy it as you can’t afford it. Or if you have no healthcare, then you have no healthcare. It doesn’t matter how much you really need it. That is just how it is. We can give it a shot but risk wrecking the whole economy by moving too fast. So we save the planet long-term but make it hard for the current people to live. Someone can ask, is a hard and miserable life worth living?

Start thinking of solutions to the problems or keep your mouth shut while real adults do what needs to be done.

Windmills may become so reliable you can leave them in high sea without worrying too much about maintenance costs. Solar and its energy-storing batteries can become more efficient. There are more promising alternatives to lithium batteries that are yet to be fully explored. And sure, even with all this working, it still seems to me that we will need nuclear. But you need that kind of courageous investment in green energy to make those leaps happen while there is still time (if there is any left). It needs to be a set of investments, and innovation firing in all cylinders. And that is absolutely why we need something like the green new deal.

First hydroelectric, dams destroy the environment so there directly not allowed. Second wind is to random to be considered reliable. Finally solar is good in the day when least power is used as people are at work, and not during the evening and night. Not only that but batteries would not be able to store enough power, unless you get so many you destroy the environment trough mining as lithium and other rare earth metal mines are very bad.

But it comes at a cost of absolute economical disruption to a point it can't be reversed and America will be past, mass unemployment and a huge supply demand gap crushing the economy. We have to take action! But in steps, ensuring the economy isn't getting disrupted. We cannot afford to remake every building, but we can find other options to patch this problem it as fast as possible then slowly but steadily walk towards the end goal.

P.S that fossil fuel took millions of years to be in the state it was when we brought it out to burn it within seconds ... see what i mean here .... it is a cycle except we sped up the production of co2 but we didnt speed up that absorbtion ,,,	UCtdvmuQ0XSRldPPoDRTgyCA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtdvmuQ0XSRldPPoDRTgyCA	1	Ugxmr2FnqH2YwvVneQh4AaABAg	Skunkworks Customs

However, many people see the green new deal as extremely unrealistic. Thats why it gets the hate it does. The people want realistic actual PLANS, not a hopeful, vague vision thats going to crash our economy if we want to try to pay for it.

However if you look at GDP per capita then its different and US usually hovers around top 10, and countries like Monaco, Qatar and Liechtenstein fare much better in large part due to high levels of wealth (and natural resources) combined with very low populations.

But you know that even in those situations, people will hold on to bad habits, even if they know they make the situation worse. The only way is living in a dictatorial regime where the dictator is pro green plan and doesn't take no for an answer. In any democratic society there will be enough forces to stop this kind of green deal, because of the costs it brings with it.

Instead they are trying to use the big grid system to transfer all the additional power produced in the north to the south of the country. All leading specialist are backing the other system but politics just listen to the big energy companies, because otherwise they would earn less money!

Your basically giving your house to the government and letting them do what they want with it. Not to mention that solar power isn’t efficient enough and have to be backed up by coal because how inefficient it is. Just look up Germany. They tried going all solar and windmills and now Germany is going back because they were wasting more energy keeping the windmills up then they were going from them	UCK2pw9s14guz1BI_P8UkRew	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK2pw9s14guz1BI_P8UkRew	1	Ugy1eV-in2N7q9vLTTl4AaABAg	Damian Jackson
