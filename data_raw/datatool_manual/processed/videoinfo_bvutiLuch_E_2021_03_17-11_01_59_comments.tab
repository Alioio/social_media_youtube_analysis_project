The USA is facing virtual universal & vociferous opposition on this from all her (now former) allies - Except from Saudi & Russia (surprise surprise), & even they have signed up to Paris.. The deal was set up to be extremely loose, so that individual countries can implement it in any way they wish - This was at the insistence of the US. Portraying this as disadvantageous to the US is a fabrication. The US is a bigger polluter than the US per capita of population. Americans drive, fly, use more A/C & heating, eat more food etc etc, than their Chinese counterparts.

Solar and wind cannot make base load power, until then they are only supplementary feeds at best and it all relies on the weather. When your running an arc furnace you cant wait for the wind to turn it on. Alternative energy will be embraced when it can contribute to reliable base load that is predictable to use. Then you can enact a greener future, but that tech is not here yet. You cant do a night shift on solar? The tech will eventually come about then you can worry about making green power when its more cost effective and reliable for gird base load.

UggolOvuHFSQxngCoAEC.8TEzIxPSw018TUd5T8QwL4		0	2017-06-07 00:06:39	Cuddly Jon	John Mark, I just looked at a graph presented by the Environmental Protection Agency of the U.S. Link: https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/us-greenhouse-gas-inventory-report-1990-2014 By the graph, it seems like the U.S. has been wiggling around 6,500 "emission" units since the 90s. There was a significant drop but, only after a gradual increase with a peak in 2007 or so. Not to mention, there doesn't seem to be any other significant drop that has placed us back at the low of 91. What do you mean by "past years," exactly? Thank you for your input, btw. I appreciate people that voice their opinions without insults. Do you believe we're keeping our emissions within this range and is such a range safe? Do we have to drop lower to keep our environment good? One thing that is definitely suggested by this is that the U.S. certainly has not increased in emissions over these years and has not played a major role in the contribution to the rising CO2 output. Check this graph: Link: https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-data The U.S. has been wiggling but the emissions steeply increased not as a direct result of the U.S. Still, U.S. isn't entirely off the hook because the European Union still contributes 6% less than the U.S. does. The biggest question though, should we help out China and the other nations to decrease their emissions? I understand what you're saying, John. U.S. gotta look out for the U.S. but if we join the Agreement, there's a political statement being made that the U.S. hopes for a "greener" world (I don't want hotter summers). Plus, does the U.S. contribute to it indirectly? A lot of goods are outsourced from China and they make their way into the U.S. for sale. Does the U.S. bear some responsibility for the demand of such goods in that aspect?

Is it a priority for the federal government? But my point is, US during the past years had made effort to greatly reduce CO2 emissions via heavy regulations but other countries do not, like China even though they are bragging about its commitment but made no actual effort. So it is fair to say that leave a wide space for the states to enforce its own environment policies.

US already decreases the CO2 emission for the past years while China isn't. China is one of the most polluted country. My point is, no developing country will follow that even they sign since it is not binding or don't have any system to enforce it. It is just a free cash for EU globalists and the developing countries. Plant many trees, protect the rainforests and the species that absorbs the CO2 emissions and the cleanliness of the seas. But not sacrificing the american industries.	UCocgrNG7vDlVhb3RDUSO1qg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCocgrNG7vDlVhb3RDUSO1qg	1	UggolOvuHFSQxngCoAEC	CloudStreets

No one, ever, can bring peace - peace of mind, peace from terrorists, peace from criminals, peace from drug abuse, peace from injustice, peace from poverty and so on. If you don't like Trump then who is the president you want? Hillary? Bernie? Those two are worst. Hillary is a corrupt thief, warmongering, corporation and megabanks puppet. Didn't you know that Obama, Hillary, Bill clinton and even Chuck Schumer proclaim that they want the border wall during the past years or decades? Politicians aren't trustworthy anymore. Bernie want to sacrifice the liberty, wealth, equal opportunity of the middle and rich classes and the life line of the American industry for the sake of social justice. Ever since the US remove the gold standard and creates a massive deficit spending, US will soon to fall. The right wants to prioritize the life line of US while the left wants to prioritize social justice while the others are just a bunch of greedy people who don't want to see the government to fall down under their watch. Atleast for Trump, he wants to slowdown the downfall of US as much as possible because Obama accelerates it through doubling trillions of debt and foreign agreements that sucked the life line of US.

Are these three things the only you ever think of? How about the three things that drives the human world into evil, Greed, Money and Power? Many sons and daughters want to get rid their of their parents to achieve liberty in different kind of reasons or to have a wealthy life upon receiving inheritance. Many parents abort their unborn babies or many people leave their elders into home for the aged because they are totally inconvenient. Many people wants justice or vengeance. Many people wants to pursuit happiness sacrificing others' liberty, life and happiness. Does peace and love gave the end for world war 2 and other wars? People don't need to "feel" hate to get rid of others in pursuit of the three things you mentioned. Does killings of hundreds of millions of religious people by Atheist regimes like Stalin, Mao and Pol pot good? Because they believe religion is the opium for the common people that caused misery and getting rid of religious people will stop it. Does killings of heretics by the Roman Catholic Church good? because they believe that only people who is one with their believe living together in this world will make the world more peaceful. Does killings of Islamic Terrorists good? because of the same reason of the former powerful church. I can go on and on to give examples of many people around the world whose moral good anchors differently from the others. We can never achieve the product of your wishful thinking because your wishes aren't the wishes of others. This world is totally unfair and full of injustice. Hating others is not the cause of chaos. As I said, many people don't need to feel hate to get rid of even some random inconvenient guy in pursuit of happiness. If the border wall is a symbol of hate for you, well, it's a peaceful solution for the others. My advice for you is to stop thinking wishfully of something impossible for all mankind. To have a peace in this world, the only possibility is to remove the freedom of the will or feel to desire which is of course so far from even 1% chance since it is embedded in humans.

Anyone that has these three things is truly free. To have peace around the world these three things should not be horded just for ourselves (USA) and lock up the borders. We all live on one planet. Ideologies and cultures and these freedoms are not mutually exclusive. They are compatible to all people of this world. Until we extend these rights to ALL people of the world, there will never be peace. Call me a snowflake if you like, but war and hate is clearly not the answer. It is insanity. We as a species have committed these acts since the dawn of humans and it has stunted the possibilities for the extent of our existence.

If this is correct, then who cares that we must remain a party to the agreement for a few more years? The government can simply do nothing, whilst writing reports to tell the other parties to the agreement that we are doing nothing.

His intentions and motives are clear to me that he ONLY cares about the financial welfare of America. He says “China is eating our lunch” as if they’re stealing our money. A lot of people choose China to manufacture a lot of their products because it’s financially efficient for businesses. Sadly so the consequence of that is poor climate in Asia, they’re big sufferers from the pollution in the air.	UCCG8NkjAFk5lBokdp4YJLjQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCG8NkjAFk5lBokdp4YJLjQ	0

Only thing that changed was giving millions to other nations to help improve their infrastructures. In fact I think we're still doing that regardless of not being on the Paris Accord. Why is it that everyone has it stuck in their head that we need to be on this worthless agreement?

You know who does care about Paris? The Chinese. The Russians. The Brazilians. All but three countries (America, Nicaragua, Syria) support the Paris Agreement. Some of these countries thoroughly hate each other (eg India and Pakistan, Georgia and Russia, Turkey and Armenia) but all they all agreed that they had to deal with climate change.
