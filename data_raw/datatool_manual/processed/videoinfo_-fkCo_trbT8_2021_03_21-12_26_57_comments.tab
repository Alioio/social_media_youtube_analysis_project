Am I the _only person_ who noticed that all his statements are based upon a model that they have no way of confirming actually has correct data about the planet's current mean temperature? Sorry, it's just that I live on an island: he's talking about world temperatures rising for 6, 7 decades and ice melting due to it, & I'm still here above water and so is _ALL_ the island - as are all other islands. So, like this inaccurate model, are they measuring _ice_ in only certain areas, not over all the planet? After all, we do not have accurate records of the planet's mean temperature going back to even _last_ year. Can someone show _exactly what_ data they're putting into this model?

Besides, when their work is routinely trashed, mocked and undermined by a long line of Republican politicians, most of whom are generously funded by fossil fuel donations or fat cheques from science-denying thinktanks like the Heartland Institute, what do you expect them to say to environmentalists who push back these hatchet jobs? ... “Oi! You stay out of this!” ? “They allowed politicians and grifters like Al Gore and Ocasio-Cortez to make a mockery of their relatively new science. Oh is that so? So if you think Gore and AOC are making a mockery of climate science, WTF do you think Neanderthals like Tony Heller (“Make no mistake, global warming is the biggest scientific fraud in history ”), Jim Inhofe (“[Global warming is] the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people.”) or Donald Trump (“global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.”) are doing for climate science? Get a grip of yourself. “Climatologists have allowed themselves to supercede the science itself because they like the attention and funding that comes with calls to existential threats.” Read that sentence to yourself, Ken, and ask yourself how many of the hundreds of thousands of scientists who work in the broad field of climate research this rather rash generalization applies to. Now….care to reword it? “When a group of scientists are doing their best to sing in unison you know you have a REALLY big problem.” Ken, that is just a huge, steaming pile of horseshit. You are simply crimping out more vacuous, unsubstantiated and inane verbal diarrhoea. Once again, you are showing contempt for an entire field of scientists and your complete ignorance of the culture and mindset that prevails among scientists. I work for the world’s largest oil company and I cross paths every day of the week with some of the most brilliant scientists you could hope to work with, and I know from many a bracing personal experience that scientists are the most argumentative, pedantic contrarians in any organization. So when they do all “sing in unison”, as they do with anthropogenic global warming, yes, mankind should realize that it does have a really big problem. For once, you have been right, albeit entirely by accident. “That's exactly the opposite conditions in which science produces optimum results.” Ken, it is now abundantly clear that you know fuck all about science.

Did you look through the timeline of scientific research I posted earlier, which shows that we have known since the 19th century that emitting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere will cause the globe to warm? Here it is again. https://history.aip.org/history/climate/timeline.htm …and here is another one for good measure. https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn9912-timeline-climate-change/ But I would still be fascinated to hear why you think “it’s to climatology’s advantage that it came about in the modern era”. Please do explain.   “I tried to spare you the embarrassment of posting all the inaccurate predictions climatologists have made…” Well, you still are “sparing me the embarrassment”. Don’t be shy. Let’s have a close look at them…   “Peer review is an unsettled science and an unfalsifiable context. Amongst a group of other human egos invested in having confidence in their field of study.” Ken, you become less planted in reality and less coherent with each comment you post. Peer review, in and of itself, is not “science” as applied through scientific methodology but a component part of the scientific method, so it makes no sense at all to suggest it is “an unsettled science”. It is as non-sensical as saying “licking a stamp is not a reliable way to communicate”. Furthermore, since peer revision is about being willing to expose one’s work to forensic scrutiny so that any faults in data, methodology or conclusions drawn can be found, it is the antithesis of egotism. It is the charlatans like Tony Heller and Christopher Monckton, neither of whom are credentialed in the field of climate research, and who pontificate to a very uncritical and receptive audience, whose egos stand out. You seem to have made your mind up about what you want to believe and you’re now constructing convenient narratives to colour it in. For someone who earlier laid claim to knowing so much about “the history of science”, you seem very ready to peddle in baseless innuendo and borderline swivel-eyed paranoia.

Amongst a group of other human egos invested in having confidence in their field of study. I think its amazing you have so much confidence in an unsettled science. You honestly don't see any correlation with meteorology? We still can't accurately predict tornadoes. Although they occur frequently and have been measured in the context of the atmospheric conditions in which they originate, it's still too complex for anything related to accuracy. We know what types of patterns to look for but predicting the exact time and place is still entirety out of reach. Why? Because even relatively short time intervals and relatively small localities contain too much data for our models to delineate with accuracy. But somehow this relatively microscopic group of climatologists have figured out one of the most complex systems humans have ever grappled with. 40 years is nothing. Medical science has been around in some form for around 5000 years. 5000 years and we still don't know everything there is to know about our human size bags of complexities. Can you imagine the resources and combined thought invested into medical science over the last 5000 years? Climatology barely even exists by comparison. If only I could transport you 1000 years into the future; your epiphany would be entertaining to witness.

That means that their work can be studied and those who find fault with it can submit rebuttals. When you characterise them as "selling their wares" for funding, you not only betray your ignorance of how scientists think, you display the rooted ideology that informs your view. If you think the scientists are wrong in their prediction that we are heading for catastrophic warming, then don't cite me fossil-fuel-funded marketing men like Alex Epstein - I know exactly what he is doing. Cite me a peer reviewed paper that was published in a credible journal which shows convincing evidence that all the climate researchers are wrong.

As you can see, the current consensus has been over a century in the making. The basic principle that if we continue to emit gigatons of GHGs into our atmosphere then temperatures will rise, probably catastrophically, has been established in the science literature for over 40 years. Feel free to continue believing that climate scientists cannot model temperature accurately, but unless you are a climate scientist of considerable standing, you have no authority to make such a declaration. And even then, you would find yourself in a very small minority. Don't confuse complexity with unfeasibility.

There are public perceptions of the challenges involved with modelling climate, some of which are informed and some of which are rooted in ideology, and then there is the record of the climate models, which we can compare to observed temperatures over time. Some climate scientists get it wrong - they are the outliers. What the IPCC does is aggregate the results of many disparate disciplines within the broad field of climate research and go through a painstaking process of cross-checking and validation. Every 6 or 7 years, they publish an Assessment Report which articulates in terms of probability the confidence they have in what the climate will do. If you go back to AR1 (1990) and AR2 (1995), you'll be able to compare what they were saying about the climate today with observed measurements. And you'll find that the IPCC does a damn fine job at delivering very accurate predictions of what the climate is doing.

Scared that they are going to lose millions in revenue, the dastardly tobacco companies start paying doctors (and people pretending to be doctors) to recommend cigarettes as a healthy antidote to stress and as an appetite suppressant. They pay other scientists to come up with junk pseudoscience in an effort to disprove the link between smoking and cancer and to sew doubt in the minds of the public about the credibility of the scientists who claim smoking is bad for you. They pay lobbyists to persuade politicians that taxing cigarettes would cost thousands of jobs and that banning smoking in public spaces would be an infringement upon people's freedoms. Its a movie you've seen before, and the fossil fuel companies are using exactly the same script as the tobacco companies. When scientists bring bad news for big businesses making billions, they get their work trashed - even if they happen to have been actually paid by the big business in the first place, as happened with the Exxon scientists who found that the long term effects of burning fossil fuels would have a "catastrophic" impact on the climate. The fact is that the science that proves the link between GHG emissions and global warming has been refined over 120 years and is 10th grade simple. The only uncertainties surround how much time we've got to act. If you think the scientists don't know what they are doing, it is because you've chosen to watch the movie instead of the documentary.

The meteorology discipline can be modeled and the predictions compared to empirical outcomes in real time. Trial - error - adjustment - improve. The climatology discipline is more complex due to unknown precise quantities and unknown variables that play out over much longer periods of time. The climatology discipline has much less intellectual and monetary investment and exists without the training wheels of countless trial and error adjustments.

The fact is that, during a period when solar irradiance has been decreasing for over thirty years, logically indicating that the planet should really be cooling right now, climate scientists have been very successful in modelling correctly, to a very useful degree of accuracy, a rising mean global surface temperature. https://climatenewsnetwork.net/why-we-should-be-cooling-not-warming/	UCNbqDbC3eFJ0uvaq8LEZuQw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNbqDbC3eFJ0uvaq8LEZuQw	1	UgwYg9ibnAA5JIJMIUh4AaABAg	Bill Brockman

Climatologists have no idea how quickly the warming would be occurring minus the human species. Scientists are good at making predictions they can test and measure in a low entropy lab and in relatively short time intervals. Creating models and comparing them to real time empirical data. This is the wheelhouse of successful science. Earth climate models over long periods of time are incredibly complex and climatologists don't even know the multitude of absorption variables they aren't even aware of for instance. Remember Chernobyl? Scientists predicted it would take generations before wildlife would flourish in that immediate area again. Turns out the Earth was far more resilient to such things than previously estimated. Think of the massive resources and combined human thought energy dedicated to short term climate models, better known as: meteorology. The funding and manpower of that industry absolutely dwarfs that of long term climatology and yet they still can't accurately predict short term weather patterns. Long term climate models are far more complex, have far more variables and yet they claim to understand the science being conducted. We have been warming since the last ice age and the Earth has been through many rapid warming and cooling cycles in its history. The Earth has spent the majority of its timeline at much higher temperatures than it is now. Climatology is a racket and if you study the history of science you will learn this isn't the first time humans have been wildly over their skiis in this fashion. Humans are nothing if not egotistical creatures who believe they have the answers to everything. Throw in a complex issue that can be used to extract money and votes and you have the recipe for mass delusion.

The models form around national and institutional bias. As for human perfection, if it’s human imperfections then why do they assume the models model the climate accurately. I have a big problem with the accuracy of the models and the ethics of the scientific process. Just look at east Anglia university and the fake hockey stick and data adjustments. So for me there is an inherent bias in climate science, the models and the political class that get collateral from saying such stuff. Irrespective of whether climate change is man made, we should be sustainable and look after the planet. One other problem I have with the models is that they pertain to model a climate which is so complex. It is human niavity that believes something like this can be accurately modelled. When you look at the models as I have done you can see the assumption made and as I say, increase albedo or radiance et al you can introduce a bias. That’s not human imperfections. It’s called developing a model to curve fit. Very dangerous. And yes these models are advanced curve fitting then extrapolation exercises.

One model may bias albedo effect from cloud. One bias may increase the effect of co2. There is also institutional where institution have to demonstrate climate change. This can be associated with political bias that has pushed the climate agenda. I’m not a climate denier and I do believe in sustainability. However from my experience development of models requires numerical models to exist. It requires the interpretation of these numerical models. It requires the checking of the model against existing data. All those models which match existing data may actually be based upon bias assumptions within the model. Any bias in models does not show up when you compare to existing data. But when you extrapolate into the future any bias can distort the model. The problem. These models are developed from the mind of the thinker and developer of the model. The model will then be tinkered with yo match existing data. It’s an interesting process. The iccp use this extrapolated data to demonstrate potential scenario. So the models include both external and internal bias. They may not actually represent anything just the musings of those developing the models. IMO.

But it is everywhere out there with climate change, and yes it is ethically wrong to create a false impression. Just because its popular to engage in deception doesn't make it ok. Perhaps it is unconscious, that's possible. But I suspect originators know quite well what they are pulling off. Another example: They say Denver water is "acidic" when it is in fact not acidic at all, it is alkaline (above 7): "This new pH range is between 8.5 and 9.2 ... making the water slightly less acidic". The easiest way to manipulate the public is through fear. . Or, for example, they claim up to 200 species per day are going extinct from climate change, see Greta Thunberg TEDx talk at 4 minutes, it's scaring the children as designed. So congratulations, you're on that team that loves deception, I suggest you learn, look into a few of the counter points and consider bailing. Team-honest will welcome you. . Did that extinction claim come from a scientific study or even a model? None known. It was a lie evidently created out of thin air on the UN Environment Programme site in 2004, geared toward kids, no reference, removed in 2009 probably because they realized it has no connection to reality too much, embarrassingly so, pure fantasy, a complete lie. At that rate there are over 1 million species extinct from climate change since then, and they can't name a single one. (You'll find the melomys doing quite well thank you in New Guinea, its natural habitat surely vs that desolate 9 acre sand bar where it disappeared, simply show the cannibals a picture, have you seen this mousy thing(?), I hear they are quite hospitable and will even invite you over for dinner). The claim might have been fabricated by the World Bank along with WorldWatch for Rio+5 in 1997. If they were smart they would speak out against that outrageously nonsensical claim and score some integrity points with the public but they will not do so as they don't believe in the concept. Sorry if I sound annoyed, I am. . Why do you claim I supposedly didn't read the papers? My questions were about calcium carbonate (CaCO3), not mentioned in either paper. But they have the string 'model' 245 times, there are millions of models, there are 200 million pages on 'climate change' 'model'. (I suspect goog rounded that number, har har). . When I'm asked questions I give people either answers to the best of my knowledge or URL's they can use for starters. It doesn't take hours. . So anyway, as you can see folks, Arctic Haze and I do not agree on everything. I suggest we leave it at that or this could go on forever, and with each round, more evidence of climate change having it wrong will emerge, we're just scratching the surface.

Peace. In fact, color it green, why not. . My original point disregarded (because they like the perceived power in ad hominem instead of discussing actual science) ... Over the last 200 years, the magnetic field [of Earth] has lost around 9% of its strength (ESA) Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) has weakened by 15-20% in 200 years. (UCM) CO2 levels rise when Atlantic Circulation is weak and fall when it’s strong. (EOS) CO2 levels in the air have increased over 40% since 1880 (climatechangenews) Natural CO2 is 95% of overall .

Is the wikipedia Ocean acidification page correct that it really isn't becoming acidic but instead just a slight change in the basic range from 8.25 to 8.14? Using the footnote, the article they point to is practically ancient history, 1998. Not as some sort of gotcha but just to learn, does aragonite crop up in the classroom, the form of calcium carbonate life forms use to in exoskeletons? Does that capture of CO2 happen mostly near shores or also near the surface out in the open ocean? I imagine there's a cycle there, the CO2 is not locked up forever. Tiny shells fall to the bottom and eventually dissolve with the CO2 released as a gas again? Does that play a role? . What are some of the key points people maybe ought to be aware of?

It is too extensive for me to list all the literature I've been pouring through. You are quick to judge, my friend, with little info to go on, but I'm glad you did ask at the end of that. And good to hear you are a scientist, thanks for mentioning some of your experience. When I asked "Source?", that could too easily sound as if I don't believe you and some sort of invitation to a cage-match or who can bark the loudest, I should have worded it as simply a request for papers **YOU** consider worthwhile, because the 1.7 million results with co2 and flux in google scholar make my eyes cross, to say nothing of the 68 million with a plain google search (both using quotes of course, to insist both words do appear). The papers you pointed to are well done and appreciated. However ... . My point of view is: Not only are ingredients being ignored, if you mention it they get emotional and that's a bad sign, it is anti-science. I have a theory that once they get past their anger they might begin to consider these other potential factors. And greater public knowledge of ocean slowing and air stilling will help pressure them to do so. I want them to include it in studies even if they can prove it not a factor. But more to the point ... . The European Space Agency used SWARM satellites concluding Earth's magnetic field is steadily weakening and NASA has a page crediting ESA, it correlates with CO2 rise yet is ignored in models (of course) since it's a mystery so it would not make sense to include the magnetic field factor, that's ok. Some papers theorize on how that could be driving both ocean slowing (well-known) and atmospheric stilling (less well-known) and by the way I don't necessarily agree with them (I have my own theory based on some of my education and experience in physics etc over 45 years). I think ocean slowing especially can be a critical factor in CO2 flux (between air and ocean waters) so ignoring that one is not ok. Air stilling seems to also be omitted in the realm of air CO2 measurements. This might be important because, for example, although I can't find much detail about their CO2-level determinations, since carbon 14 is literally heavier, more still air could mean more 14C in "inventory" collected and therefore anthropogenic CO2 (our 4-5% portion) could then actually be even HIGHER than we think because the Suess Effect is based on its absence as you know (but some did not). . In science, we gather information, examine things, and often computer models are created based on data, trying to arrive at the best conclusions we can, and models are modified over time looking for predictive value and better understanding. Everyone knows models have flaws. To their credit, the ESSD paper acknowledges weaknesses/incertainties etc, that's as it should be, they are candid. I haven't read the other one as much and will give them the benefit of the doubt for now that they probably do the same. . A problem arises when inputs are disregarded. The Mostofa paper cites Fransson's study in one area south of Africa, "surface water sinks and thus brings CO2 into deeper layers". ESSD Friedlingstein et al acknowledges DeVries and the ocean weakening trend. But these appear to be in passing. If that factor is quantified in the models, then mea culpa and I would like to be corrected, although it would be almost impossible for them to do so because the 4,500 Argo floats only take readings as deep as 2 km and the mere 80 in number *deep* Argo floats do 6 km, but in general it leaves some 3/4ths of ocean depths we know little about. A mystery. . It is useful to do thought experiments using extremes. Since our oceans are slowing down, what if they were completely still? Heat rises and cold sinks. Our air would be warmer. CO2 from air would no longer make its way down deep, correct? The warmer water near the surface would not absorb as much CO2 from the air. We would see more CO2 in the air. It might be as if the ocean, from the CO2 point of view, is smaller, since it might only be interacting with upper -- layers, for want of a better word. . You are knowledgeable about CO2 exchange and pH etc. One of the reasons I asked for your source is because I want to learn more about acidification. I understand it involves calcium carbonate, CO2 being captured by the growth of small shells, which then sink to the bottom eventually. And other beautifully complex stuff. . Maybe you could help clarify? . Vast realm, I'd suggest instead of demonizing each other we simply talk the content of the topic. . Thanks in advance.

Overturning Circulation "(AMOC) has weakened by 15-20% in 200 years. (UCM) CO2 levels rise when Atlantic Circulation is weak and fall when it’s strong. (EOS) CO2 levels in the air have increased over 40% since 1880 (climatechangenews) Human CO2 is less than 5% vs natures CO2 over 95% of overall. . A search will find those middle four lines.

Now my comment: "Irreversible retreat"? The oceans used to be MUCH higher millions of years ago when the temperature was MUCH higher than it is now. So tell me, how could we have 'irreversible retreat' now when there wasn't 'irreversible retreat' then? How did the earth end up cooling down and adding all that ice? The earth isn't a thermostat that goes from 'off' to 'on' at a certain point. It is a complex set of subsystems that all interact to shed/absorb heat based on an incredible number of variables. CO2 is certainly one variable in that, but so is water and water vapor, the interaction of chemistry in the ocean which affects heat absorption, and a whole host of other barely understood processes.

It's just sad that in this day and age so many people still lack basic understanding of the peer review process and how brutal it is, but here we are. Anyhow, that's where these comments come from. Also, I have a feeling that a lot of people left their comments before even seeing the video, which is probably one of the reasons for this many dislikes. I don't think I've ever seen a video of her with that many dislikes. These so called "skeptics" were probably disappointed to see just a normal video of two scientists talking, without an inkling of human caused climate change denial, lol! Btw...she was asking pertinent questions, and for the opposite reason of what the video title might suggest. It's because Sabine is in fact very passionate about climate change, often advocating that more resources be put into that field. Given that the main issue seems to be the grid resolution that's lacking and computing power in general, she's right.

Topics like global warming become heavily politicized, and people are just tired of the public interest constantly being prioritized second to politics, or funding, or whatever else gets in the way. Climate is likely the next "bank bailout" scenario where trillions in taxes go to private companies. The big pink elephant in the room is the burning question - "is carbon the only explanation, or, are other, natural factors contributing to global warming too?". Those are the kind of questions ordinary people want answers to. Instead, we get this poor guy from Oxford, absolutely quivering over modeling fundamentals.... and rightfully so.

I think there are implied positions in the interview and intro text, intended to reveal that she knows perfectly well "scientists have done their jobs" in evidencing and explaining the broad likelihoods and seriousness of AGW. But given the present cultural and political conflict around the subject, I think it would be more courageous and clarifying if she could make her major positions on the subject explicit - even just for the sake of releasing these hoards of nay-sayers from the folly of expending their opinions and on each and every anecdote and ambiguity to keep erroneous belief relevant.

With a well paced CO2 pricing as above, this would not be the case.

This is plain bullshit. It won’t even help against blackouts like the one you were quoting and, while leaving some quckstart gas plants in place will be a good safety reserve for some time, with increasing storage capacity of different types, the need will shrink over time. It would be much better to build solar plants in Southern Europe than get gas from Putin‘s Russia.

Out of Merkel and Trump, I think she’s is worse and more dangerous then him I owned a Ship Engineering company before i retired and I live on a sailing ship and now that I am retired I can travel where ever I want, but I choose warmer climates., with my job and my way of living I need to understand power generation and also renewables, I’ve been using renewables before you were born. I can tell you that power generation is not hard, storage of the power is the problem. Batteries cannot provide for modern living and definitely not for heavy industry. It’s not only the storage but flow of the power, if there is a sudden spike in either direction it can damage equipment. My day is constantly checking the power. This is how I know politicians do not know what they are talking about, most do not understand the most efficient power is near to its source of generation. Because I had a business in Engineering I get to hear a lot of the behind the scenes thing that go on and I can tell you there is a lot of people making money, gaining power and after the tax payers dollars. In Australia 🇦🇺 the state South Australia that has gone to the biggest renewables had a major blackout. Australians stopped the carbon tax but the government sets the payments for power to the bid with renewables factored in so power generation is getting too expensive for the poor, industries cannot afford power and are moving, plus it is unreliable. The solution to the blackout is a battery bank to provide power until it the supply can be directed from a coal plant in another state. This will be the same for Germany after 2020 and your power may came from France or Russia. In closing another strange idea is to let China and India build as many coal power plants as they can, while we destroy ours, so climate change rules need not apply?

That's why you are a delusional fuckwit.	UCGcEOvg7z8aL9LvTH4QFnWA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGcEOvg7z8aL9LvTH4QFnWA	1	UgwYg9ibnAA5JIJMIUh4AaABAg	Bill Brockman

No, I was not saying any of that. > Big corporations are working with government... This is, as said before, a very strange assumption. Just rephrasing it does not making it more probable. In fact you are adding yet another argument, because these „corporations“ are running desinformation think tanks like CFACT (or EIKE in Germany). Why should they when it would be in their interest to go all renewables? > ...to bleeding tax payers... I don’t know what orange presidents would do, but here in Germany all models assume that the amounts taken from the CO2 emitters are distributed evenly across all people so that those who care are rewarded compared to those who waste. So this seems to be plain desinformation, too. > As we now know... At least I know that since 1985. Science knows it since Arrhenius’ paper dating back to 1896. Funnily, there were even governments reading scientific papers. You know what happened in Sweden in 1991? They introduced a CO2 price — which is now at 115+ Euros per metric ton. And corporations are still whining because only some of them got exceptions. > A lot of scientists... No. I know of no serious scientist assuming that. Only desinformation think tanks and former scientists now on oil&gas payroll „think“ that. And btw, same as you, I do not > choose and do without electricity and ... computers Why should I? But I consume only electricity from renewables, and so does my company, and many others at least aim for that, because they are on the same page with science and future.

I disagree, politicians are a necessary evil and we need to keep a lot of checks and balances on them, watch Milton Friedman thoughts on big government. Some politicians are corrupt, some are idolistic, many are just lazy and like the gravy train. Do you really think you can trust them. Big corporation are working with government in the renewable industry to bleeding tax payers, the end game is an carbon tax, big government, big corporations and a lot of regulations. note; Renewables rely on hydro, oil and gas industry to back up the power generation. Cheap, clean power is nuclear energy but it cannot work with renewables so is not promoted. I have been looking into the global cooling/ global warming/climate change for over 20 years, what first took my interest was people talking about "increasing carbon', I thought how does someone do that? As we now know; they are talking about CO2. A lot of scientist think now that CO2 follows temperature, I believe this is what the ice samples proved, when Al Gore put on his movie about global warming, what he said would be true IF CO2 was the cause, so far his predictions have not been true. If you believe in global warming, go and live however you choose and do without electricity and modern things like computers, TV etc but don't force it onto us to pay for your life choice or live like you.

The question remains why you think AGW is a „political concept“. Acting on it is so difficult from a policy maker‘s perspective. For most politicians things would work out much easier when decisions go side-by-side with global corporations needs. So why should any policy maker take up the hard work to defend a global conspiracy when truth would be they can continue as usual. So your assertion is very, very improbable and I kindly ask why you are promoting it.

Sincerely, Michael Densberger Remote Sensing Systems 707-545-2904 ext. 11 From: <My super hero secret identity redacted> Sent: Saturday, November 11, 2017 4:00 PM To: support-AT-remss-DOT-com <link changed to see if that lets it post in comments> Subject: STAR MSU onboard calibration procedure mismatches a solid-housed thermometer placed in the atmosphere If I'm understanding the STAR microwave sounding unit (MSU/AMSU) onboard calibration procedure correctly, then it measures a different physical aspect of Earth's atmosphere than is measured by a thermometer (either liquid-expansion or platinum-resistance) and it measures a lesser physical aspect. The underlying reason for the difference is that there is no long-wave radiation (LWR) inside a solid such as a platinum-resistance thermometer. I've never heard a climate scientist mention this. If the lower tropospheric (for example) atmosphere warms then there is an anomaly in these forms of energy: - molecular kinetic energy (molecular translational energy, heat), - LWR energy, - molecular vibrational energy of the GHGs (primarily H2O in the gaseous form). The warm target in a MSU/AMSU is a solid blackbody whose temperature is measured by platinum resistance thermometers embedded in it. The microwave flux density from it is used to scale microwave flux density (thermal emission) from molecules (primarily oxygen) in the atmosphere. The issue I see is that this onboard calibration procedure causes the instrument to scale such that it measures only molecular kinetic energy (molecular translational energy, heat) in the atmosphere and excludes LWR energy and molecular vibrational energy of the GHGs in the atmosphere. This means that differentiation over time of this proxy measures only heat anomaly. A liquid-expansion or platinum-resistance thermometer placed in the atmosphere at elevation 2m (for example) above ocean or land surface measures: - molecular kinetic energy (molecular translational energy, heat) plus - LWR energy plus - molecular vibrational energy of the GHGs (primarily H2O in the gaseous form) because LWR energy and molecular vibrational energy of the GHGs are transmuted to molecular kinetic energy (molecular translational energy, heat) upon impacting upon the molecules of the solid and I understand that there is no transverse electromagnetic radiation inside a solid. Placement of the thermometer inside an enclosure does not exclude the LWR energy and molecular vibrational energy of the GHGs due to GHG molecule collisions. Thus, differentiation over time of the liquid-expansion or platinum-resistance thermometer proxies for temperature measures the sum of all three anomalies but differentiation over time of the microwave flux density (thermal emission) from molecules (primarily oxygen) in the atmosphere at the example elevation of 2m measures only the molecular kinetic energy (molecular translational energy, heat) anomaly with the STAR microwave sounding unit (MSU/AMSU) onboard calibration procedure as described. In order for the MSU/AMSU to measure the same physical aspect as a liquid-expansion or platinum-resistance thermometer it would be necessary to calibrate with the warm target being atmospheric gases in close proximity to a solid whose temperature is measured by platinum-resistance thermometers, or a compensating adjustment could be made during analysis such as RSS and UAH based upon the ratio of LWR energy + molecular vibrational energy of GHGs to molecular kinetic energy in the atmosphere. Please inform whether: 1) I'm misunderstanding the physics, or 2) I'm not including another aspect of STAR microwave sounding unit (MSU/AMSU) onboard calibration procedure that deals with this issue, or 3) A compensating adjustment for this is made during analysis such as RSS and UAH based upon the ratio of LWR + molecular vibrational energy of GHGs energy to molecular kinetic energy in the atmosphere, or 4) The ratio of LWR + molecular vibrational energy of GHGs energy to molecular kinetic energy in the atmosphere is so negligible (far less than uncertainties) that no compensating adjustment for it is required for analysis such as RSS and UAH.

The deal is just to keep putting out actual WG1 climate science in print and talk in the expectation that one in 9,999 readers/listeners will turn out not to be a coal/oil shill-fuckwit but yet hasn't gotten around to a basic education on it yet. They are all standard level 0 (bottom-of-toilet level) coal/oil shill-fuckwits in the many comments down here that I've browsed so far, no science interest at all from any of them. Here's cut'n'paste of my take on that aspect to a Pollyanna in another climate video just now:.... @John Gage "Unfortunately they are unaware they are being fed lies". Oh that isn't it at all. You aren't following the social aspect that has glued itself to this particular science in an effort to fuck it up for their personal wealth interest only. It's that they don't care in the fucking slightest whether they are "being fed lies" as you type or getting valid science because they have zero interest in the topic. Absolutely zero interest in the topic from any of them at all. Their interest is absolutely 100% socio-political-wealth based and they've decided what is best for their wealth/life/fun with zero regard for anything else at all, all of them, no exceptions, I've been carefully studying their responses to me and others for 7 years, I've carefully studied thousands of those for any hint of an interest at all in the science, there is none, zero. So, with this being demonstrably, with utter certainty, the case as they all (no exceptions) demonstrate continuously the last 7 years to my knowledge (so actually somewhat longer) all they need then is constant ==excuses== which will ==always== be provided by those who make wealth directly by concocting those excuses (a new profession for this has come into existence) and funded by those wealthiest who have the most to gain/lose by alteration of their vast wealth. So it isn't in the slightest that "they are unaware they are being fed lies" but that they don't have the slightest interest. You can never, ever, ever convince somebody of scientific facts when they have decided (== rightly or wrongly ==) that their best personal wealth interest depends on them not understanding it.

I am not clear about your comment "Just it is never reflected in the agenda driven pseudoscience narrative called Climate Change. I'd rather be a Catastrophic Climate Change Denier than a Science Denier". I am not an expert in climate science, but I do think they(Climate scientists and the IPCC) are "more honest" than groups in some way or the other connected to or manipulated by the fossil fuel industry trying to muddy the waters and delay regulations. I'd put some emphasis on the more honest. When talking to the general public some scientists may have slightly exaggerated various effects, but this is science which has been needlessly politicized by various greedy interests(fossil fuel industry). In such an environment it is understandable that people(climate scientists) could be frustrated.

She was looking at the question with a bit more granularity. I think she highlighted why there is noise in the models. We know what is needed. We know that we don't know what the tipping point is and our current tipping points are from aggregating lower level models. This all seems reasonable to me. I don't know why climate skeptics jump for joy about this. Maybe they feel any ambiguity is THE ambiguity that allows them to maintain their religious skepticism. I don't know. But she seems to have given us a very good state of play vision of where the science is and where it needs to go. Which was helpful, at least to me.

Being based on science isn't the same thing as being science. The claim that CO2 drives up temps is wrong as ice core records show. CO2 level lags temps. The Earth is actually in a severe CO2 deficit today. The fossil records show CO2 levels are normally much higher on Earth. Reduce CO2 and kill the plants, then kill us.

Lets be clear the complexity of the climate will not be well understood anytime soon. You might as well be asking for proof of dark matter. Regardless of what you believe I contend you are dealing with an unknowable future. So rationally work to clean up pollution and work for sound energy policies... because there will be the continued burning of copius amounts of fossil fuel for a while...it's just reality. It's kinda like walking past Godzilla and hoping you don't wake him up.... Oh and In case you haven't noticed our study of global warming so far is so muddy and political it just begs one to be a skeptic...and Any rational person knows Energy Solutions by current renewables are woefully inadequate and hardly "clean". Perhaps something like thorium reactors can help but will the public embrace thermal nuclear reactors? At this point we have very little choice but to adapt to our problems and study more. You do understand that climate change can also happen totally independently of our CO2 levels..this is a fact.

He says 2 things ; Global warrming has been proven beyond a shadow of a doubt. Secondly, we are stil bad at predicting local effects. Lowering CO2 per person is very easy without any personal sacrifises. For instance, CO2 per person in the US is 15T per year and 4,5T per year in France. A lot of new tech that is better for lowering CO2 is also better for people, for instance cars. Electric cars are simpler to build,cheaper to maintain and much more powerfull than petrol cars. In 5 years time the battery problem will have been solved and you' ll have a much better product. The transition from oil to electric will be as the transition from steam to oil.

That's fine, but I just want to clarify the difference. Yet, experts exist event if you'd have them stripped of the title. They even disagree with each other often times, pursuing separate theories. Of course, I agree that people have egos in any situation (and historically, so much has led to problems in the scientific community, much like in the political sphere), but ultimately science has the benefit of being a philosophy which can only call itself 'science' when it is not dismissing evidence; and therefore a misuse of the philosophy is far more vulnerable to being debunked within its own sphere (where the peer-review of findings and attempts to disprove are the cornerstone of the endeavor).

It’s pretty clear that neither of them even entertain the idea that the planet is not warming or that the warming is not being caused by human activity, which is what it means to be an AGW skeptic. So the scientific discussion concerns the issue that *given* the fact that human activity is warming the planet, how fast is it occurring and what is the uncertainty in our ability to predict both the global mean and local dynamics and most importantly the levels of warming that lead to irreversible transitions. Just because we agree that global warming is real doesn’t mean we can predict its consequences or the extent of warming, especially at smaller scales, with absolute certainty, and that uncertainty effects what actions we should take, so it’s the relevant question to address. But the whole discussion is premised on the reality of global warming in general and the uncertainty is only in the details.

No doubt there are climate tipping points. We see tipping points evident through climate history. We’ve had glacier tipping points although high temp tipping points I don’t think are well known. Your colleague stated that bias should be removed from models. I believe the models are biased at the moment. I want robust science. We need to understand what is happening but bias does not help. Rigorous science and unbiased science is what we need. This gentleman does not appear bias. I alway listen to both sides of the discussion. Very interesting Sabine.

This is not the only video in which she tries to promote an alternative to "more popular" ideas. Like her pointing out issues with LIGO or with string theory. I understand that it is very important in science for "outsiders" to look in and check if maybe things are going off track. But in this video she isn't being brave. If this was just meant to be a semi technical interview, that's fine, but if this was meant to be some kind of critique of climatologists, then this is a pretty cheap way to critique them. Because as a scientist, I feel that the climate scientist here explained things rather well and professionally. But I am aware, and can see from the comments section, that a lot of people are seeing this same interview and coming to a very different conclusion. If it was indeed Sabine's intention to attract and feed the AGW skeptics, then this is the exact opposite of brave. It is easy for a scientist who is a AGW skeptic to get love from most everyday people.

Anyone who follows the competent but non-mainstream experts in the field will attest that there is no universal consensus. Indeed some world class experts in the field are able to make credible arguments that human CO2 is a very minor contributor to the greenhouse effect, that the registered increase in CO2 is mainly a result of natural processes, that CO2 in the atmosphere, even if doubled, cannot absorb much more IR than it currently does, that in view of the sheer quantities, water vapour is overall a much more relevant greenhouse gas, that other planets (where there is no AGW) have also registered warming, that in recent years global temperature rise is not following the rise in atmospheric CO2 levels and many other such arguments. The most worrying matter is that some of these experts have even pointed to serious flaws in past data and at least in one case this has led to court (see Michael Mann vs Tim Ball case). There is also the case of the 500 of so global scientists who wrote to the UN that there is no climate emergency. <br />Current list of signees: @t<br />It appears that climate change science is far from settled. Then there are the economic oriented arguments by Bjorn Lomborg re the unwise trends of the current measures trying to curb CO2 to reduce adverse effects of climate change.

Said differently, things were simple to grasp even as early as in the 80’s (when I was still in my teens) and as time moves ahead, climate change deniers should probably be held accountable for confusing the issues for the public while obviously serving big gaz and oil and coal’s interest. Status quo might be a human tendency, but it sure was not the right path to take as we pretty much can now observe. And the costs are not going to be less than had we invested in good and smart energy as early as back in the 80’s or even the 70’s (when Petro consortiums funded “green orgs” while supplying propaganda against clean energies — Just search for the documentary “Pandora’s promise” to get a sense of what has been going on for many decades now..) <br /><br />As for Prof Tim Palmer ideas and conclusions (after Ms. Sabine Hossenfelder reads/points to the title of an article in the Guardian — at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fkCo_trbT8&amp;t=26m42s">26:42</a>), he has made some pretty important points to take in and to have a think about. <br /><br />As I often state to my friends, peers and clients : <br />“Action without reflection is inefficient… and reflection without action is mostly useless. For real success, you truly need both.”<br /><br />Stay Safe &amp; Stay Smart!<br />:)	UCmFXkRPrg0CHhuvCN-CBLsg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmFXkRPrg0CHhuvCN-CBLsg	0

Speaker goes on to say the changes will be dramatic and swift, much more rapid than any model predicts. No one argues the Northern Jet will change dramatically.

So for one thing this tail is driven by large uncertainty in the models. The worse the models are, the higher the temperatures will be on this tail. Furthermore he ignores the tail on the other side of the distribution which has little temperature gain, or maybe even a temperature drop. This tail will be as likely as the tail that he focused on.

Places that are now notorious for being cold like Greenland once had farming settlements that managed to give good yields of crops like barley and corn during the Medieval Warm Age. So while this is a political rather than a scientific position, it still needs to be said that global warming is better than global cooling. Personally I don't buy the statement that carbon dioxide at 450ppm can affect the climate much. How much human activity was there when the globe is much warmer than it is now? Considering that it is plant food and we need them to grow our food, I am not keen in treating CO2 as a pollutant and am against caps in CO2 emissions. If anything more CO2 is good since it increases temperatures and crop yields. You also have to consider that water vapour at 100 to 40000ppm or 0.01 to 4% of the air we breathe is a much more abundant greenhouse gas. So why does no one talk about how H20 in the air results in climate change?	UCMKke45dsHtIcdOxW-3_7og	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMKke45dsHtIcdOxW-3_7og	1	UgxaRl52p8Zx4fplBZ14AaABAg	Juan Fonseca

None come even remotely close to reproducing the early 20th. century warming. So they fail to match past climate 2. The sizeable divergence at the end of the graph where almost all the models are substantially warmer than the climate record. So they fail to reproduce current climate. Both these short-comings are well known and widely discussed. So not only do they avoid seeing what is under their noses but what is well known to be the major problems with climate model output. Prof Palmer points to the origin of this problem : the sub-grid parametrisations, a nice way to talk about <b>fiddle</b> <b>factors</b> which can and are used to &quot;tune&quot; the model outputs to get whatever you want to find. The pink band is the calibration period, so models are tuned to best fit 1960-1990 and then run on to 2100. This is essentially a <b>grossly</b> <b>unscientific</b> extrapolation of an admittedly inadequate model WAY outside the calibration period. NO COMMENTS on that. Since the model mean is already diverging significantly from reality THAT is what we should be looking at before taking such unscientific projections as a basis for reorganising our entire society. I&#39;m very disappointed with Sabine for not being enquiring about these obvious flaws.	UC0je4Ysc2OfLbkrSEWL2mPA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0je4Ysc2OfLbkrSEWL2mPA	0

The ipcc made climate science into a political football when it chose one model over another that were at odds with each other.

The primary cause is rockets going through the ozone layer. As hot temperatures of rocket engines go through the ozone layer it destroys the ozone layer. This creates weaknesses in the ozone layer. Notice how rocket launch pads are in one place and have similar flight paths through space creating holes in the ozone layer. My theory is more sun energy gets though and the rays heat a spot in the ocean causing evaporation of ocean water and more or different weather patterns. What about the effects of solar flares from the sun and the effects on waves and wind? What are the frequency of solar flares of the sun flares over time? How does a weekend ozone layer effect the effects of solar flares?	UCBCDshafIl1SR2j-mKgbgmA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBCDshafIl1SR2j-mKgbgmA	0

Climate science went wrong from the beginning once they fell for climate models. here is a little thought experiment. imagine you are in a cold room and you throw logs into the fireplace. the room will reach a stable temperature at some point. is there any point in tracking how the individual objects in the room heat up? there is only one energy source. that limits the maximum temperature. there could be catastrophic events that stop you from achieving maximum temperature like opening the window. so there could be &quot;opening the window&quot; events in nature. but there is no magically creating extra logs in the fire. that is what happening when you allow multiplying factors in your climate equations.

Whenever I try to make sense of what 0.5 or 1 degree C increased in global surface temperature means, I got nowhere.<br /><br />However, when I started to try to understand the climate change by studying how energy is moved around the planet, I noted how temperature can distort the magnitude of energy flow at a region. This is because one important aspect of changes to energy flow is latent heat of fusion (334J/g) and vaporisation (2230J/g) of water. The specific heat capacity of water is small at only 4.1796 J/g K. Once I see this figure, it become apparent to me that water has a huge role to climate change. The state at which water exist on the surface of our planet has a big influence to climate forcing. Each kg of water vaporised into vapour will result in about 4200kJ of energy in the atmosphere. Once the water vapour condenses in the higher atmosphere, you get a huge amount of energy transfered to the air. It started to see the connection to why heatwave and storms are now increasingly more intense. It is simply not possible to make such observation by merely looking at the temperature. <br /><br />My thought is that if we want to deepen our understanding of climate change, we got to look at Earth&#39;s water cycle.

Now imagine instead of Bill Nye, it is thousands of less knowledgeable, unenthusiastic, overworked and underpaid teachers across a country. It quickly becomes clear that it is easy for folks to remain ignorant or misinformed, and thus unable to form nuanced opinions with accurate support.

However, I also agree that the cost of giving up on fossil fuels is probably too high (I guess more than billion people would die because of that, possibly much more because many social issues would emerge) so it would be great if we could try to scientifically estimate pros and cons of both sides (knowing that neither is perfect) and not be biased by propaganda of either side.

But then admits that the models use (empirically derived) parameters to tune the models. To me that sounds like curve fitting, not “based on fundamental physics”. And with so many degrees of freedom, you can fit an awful lot of wiggles in a curve. <br /><br />The grid spacing in the 100km range seems 2-7 orders of magnitude too large to represent what can happen with air/mixing. Maybe that is not important, but maybe it is. Has anyone taken their model, reduced the grid spacing by a factor of 4 (without changing any of the parameters), and compared the results? If so, do they have the same results? <br /><br />From other videos I have watched - a major attack on climate models has been on a multiplying effect of increasing CO2. As I understand it, this is where the known (measurable in a lab) “greenhouse effect” of doubling CO2 gets multiplied by a constant, to account for its effect on increasing cloud cover - with water vapor being the major green house gas. This effect is challenged by some scientists, who say the reflected sunlight off the clouds balances out the extra IR light absorbed by the water vapor in the clouds. <br /><br />You did not ask about this. And pretty much glossed over the entire model process, as well as the quality of the temperature data. I realize you only want to do a 10 min or so video. But you really need about 10 videos on this topic to cover it. <br /><br />And virtually all aspects of climate modeling have issues from no measures of “world temperature” data from before satellites- and huge swaths of the earth without ground temperature stations, to issues with the models being basically empirically tuned.

The general public is either completely oblivious to these issues or in a denial. I see very few (every day) people taking rational actions worthy of human intelligence and genius despite the obvious fact that our contribution to climate change is as certain as burning enormous quantities of organic matter produces enormous quantities of CO2. <br /><br />Having more accurate models to predict the catastrophic future won&#39;t make it less catastrophic. People need to be told the ugly truth about our collective behaviour. And they need to be educated. We need nothing short of renaissance to recover from decades of brainwashing by media and those who write their narratives.

How do you represent uncertainty overall? ... well okay internet says &quot;If you&#39;re adding or subtracting quantities with uncertainties, you add the absolute uncertainties. If you&#39;re multiplying or dividing, you add the relative uncertainties. If you&#39;re multiplying by a constant factor, you multiply absolute uncertainties by the same factor, or do nothing to relative uncertainties.&quot; <br />So albeit a process to rival the number crunching of the modelling itself ...it, uncertainty, would seem to be available to calculate. <br />Or is it the nature of the beast ....since, say (guessing an example) adding all the individual boundary box uncertainties always gives an answer which is (say) an order of magnitude larger than palatable ....? <br />Or is it that parameterizing say, a whole mountain chain, (rather than modelling its affects) makes error ranges meaningless? or unable to be reasonably applied?

While there is the technicality that no assertion can every be truly 100% confirmed, there are good measures for assessing the validity of a prediction based on large scale analysis of many different data sets. Anthropogenic climate change and global warming are more certain to be true than the existance of Homo Habilis.

Would you really expect the union of barbers and hair stylists to come out and say people should stop getting their hair cut and styled? I wonder if pro-global warming scientist would still claim it was a problem if they were told, &quot;If you say global warning exists, your funding will be cut off, you will have to resign and go find work in another profession.&quot; I am not making an argument either way about global warming. I honestly don&#39;t know. I would just like to hear from someone who doesn&#39;t have a vested interest in one side of the argument. To me, it&#39;s like asking your barber if you need a haircut.

The only folks disincentivized from this argument are those who wish to increase CO2 consumption. Given that everyone lives or relies on Earth, everybody has a conflict of interest with this problem, in a sense. The global rich have an additional incentive to keep co2 output to maintain their quality of life. It's very much not a scientific issue, its a social issue. Placing the onus on scientists and engineers to "solve" the problem is limiting.

From Nasa: What Effect Do Solar Cycles Have on Earth’s Climate? According to the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the current scientific consensus is that long and short-term variations in solar activity play only a very small role in Earth’s climate. Warming from increased levels of human-produced greenhouse gases is actually many times stronger than any effects due to recent variations in solar activity. For more than 40 years, satellites have observed the Sun's energy output, which has gone up or down by less than 0.1 percent during that period. https://climate.nasa.gov/blog/2910/what-is-the-suns-role-in-climate-change/#:~:text=Warming%20from%20increased%20levels%20of,0.1%20percent%20during%20that%20period. Look specially at the graph showing the inverse relationship between increased increased radiance and temperature, the temperature trends strongly up, the irradiance strongly down.

In science, yes you can create fairly accurate models of various organisms growing populations in petri dishes and so forth and come up with statistical properties like variance, but it's very unlikely you could accurately model mammal population growth the same way. The constraints are different. You have things like environmental conditions, prey, food availability, etc. you would need to model for. There's really no way to formulate "uncertainty" in such a model since you have no way to identify every possible input and calculate the probabilities of, say, the availability and adoption of various food sources. In other words, "uncertainty" in a probabilistic model makes sense. But fundamentally, it's a question of if your model is even accurate to begin with. All models make assumptions and simplifications. For complete certainty you would need to model every atom and its interaction with the Sun and other planets.

By their own admission, there are very few recording stations in the southern hemisphere and a lot of northern hemisphere stations have been encroached upon by expanding civilization.

After Al Gore lost the Presidential election in 2000 he jumped on the then catastrophic Global Warning band wagon saying the Arctic Ice Sheet would be all gone by now, the polar bears dead and Manhattan under water. Well, the Ice Sheet is still there and I believe polar bear populations are actually up. The only thing threatening Manhattan is Antifa and BLM. Al gore made a fortune selling carbon credits. Global Warming has become such a staple in the scientific community that if a scientist questions it they are shunned by fellow scientist and their funding evaporates. Global Warming/Climate Change isn&#39;t about the weather, it is about rearranging the worlds economy from the First world too the 2nd and 3rd World. The weather is always changing whether it be rising or lower temperatures. As I understand it an upcoming Maunder Minimum may actually cause a decrease in temperatures.

We assume that past warming didn&#39;t effect concentrations or release of gas from melting in past warnings(no control group to base off of) Second, we as scientists, know true accurately temperature readings wasn&#39;t accepted till mid 1850&#39;s. So, we are basing models off of 170 years of data, not enough time for proper prediction of millions of years of unknown climate changes. Another thing a lot of people do not account for, is major road systems and highways. Essentially carving passes through mountains, make a concrete asphalt rivers that storms now follow instead of its original path created by millions of years of unchanged topography. Also, major skyscrapers and buildings cause and change air movement. We also are not taking into account the heat islands of major cities and the addition radiating heat form black asphalt roads and black tar roofs. These add significant heat by not allowing it to cool keeping areas like cities under great heat. I&#39;m not saying this against climate issues, but believe a broader understanding and perspectives need addressed. All variables matter in science, even the butterfly. 😉<br />I do believe we do need to move forward and towards cleaner energy, however extremists climate people running around screaming sky is falling, doesn&#39;t help bring in more people, it puts them off.<br />Love your videos and different insite of information.

(warning: bullshit numbers incoming, they are not based on any data, but the idea still holds). If everyone lived like Buddhist monks, wearing a single piece of cloth, eating a plant-based diet and overall needing little, there could be twice as many people in the world with less impact on the environment. On the other hand, if everyone lived like the richest westerners, having private jets, private pools, several houses etc., just a few hundred million people would have a greater impact than all of humanity does today. So the goal should be to reduce consumption. This can be done by reducing the number of humans (not by genocide, but lowering fertility rates), taxing consumption (meat should be much more expensive than it is, so does petrol, fashion...), increasing production (or keeping it the same) while decreasing the environmental impact (renewable and nuclear energy, recycling...).

UgzTbstDZWxlqgQnDHR4AaABAg	2	0	2020-12-20 05:48:33	Don Jet	Follow the money. If glo-bull warming was real, the predictions alarmists made 30 years ago would have happened, but none did. They said entire nations could be wiped off the face of the earth if global warming is not reversed by the year 2000, the Maldives and Lower Manhattan would be under water by 2018, but it never happened. Al Gore made a movie that showed most of Florida under water along with other coast lines, then he built a 4 million dollar mansion on the coast of Malibu, and recently hussein odumbo bought a $15 million mansion on the east coast oceanfront. If oceans were really rising, all of the rich owners of coastal property would be moving inland, and the price of oceanfront property would be going down, but it never does. Investment banks wouldn&#39;t make loans of $50 million to Radisson (or any hotel) to build a hotel on the beach. None of the alarmist predictions have come true, and coastal property keeps increasing in value. Follow the money.<br /><br /><br /><br />As for &quot;settled science&quot;, it was settled science that eggs raised your cholesterol, now they know that was a lie. Thirty plus years ago science said cranberries caused cancer and they nearly destroyed the Ocean Spray company in the U.S., then decided cranberries were actually good for you. For over 150 years it was settled science that stomach ulcers were caused by stress, now everyone knows it&#39;s the H-pylori bacteria. Polar bears were supposed to be dying off, but the reality is there are 50% more today than there were 40 years ago. &quot;Global cooling&quot; of the 1970&#39;s, &quot;peak oil&quot; in the 1990&#39;s, BS on top of BS.  There are dozens of these examples throughout history, and the global warming hoax is just one more.<br /><br /><br />The 2005 UNEP (United Nations Environment Program) predictions claimed that, by 2010, some 50 million “climate refugees” would be frantically fleeing from certain regions of the globe. However, not only did the areas in question fail to produce a single “climate refugee,” by 2010, population levels for those regions were actually still soaring. In the Bahamas, for example, according to the 2010 census, there was a major increase in population, going from around 300,000 in 2000 to more than 350,000 by 2010. The Seychelles population grew by about 10 percent. The predictions keep getting thrown out	UC5GbEVpZ0_0fWawkSuNXQMA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5GbEVpZ0_0fWawkSuNXQMA	0

They use convoluted logic to make non-existent connections based on faulty evidence driven by their personal biases to come up with theories like, fires are hot and the planet is getting hot so the hot planet MUST be causing the fires.<br /><br />Woe be to anyone who has the audacity to say wait a minute, let&#39;s step back and examine this with an open mind using sound scientific inquiry and analyses.<br /><br />Wayne Y.

Did i get that right? Actually I think what I&#39;m getting at is that if there was more computing power available to the less dominant models that the uncertainty would be narrower thus allowing a faster better prediction of climate change as well as weather forecasting.

Water vapor is the warming gas that is 25-30 times more powerful than CO2 and does not have CO2&#39;s weird fact that as you double its atmospheric ppm values its ability to absorb the infrared spectrum is logarithmic and not linear.

It goes on to say &quot;Though there have been previous periods of climatic change, since the mid-20th century the rate of human impact on Earth&#39;s climate system and its global scale have been unprecedented.&quot; I&#39;m also not sure what that&#39;s supposed to tell us. They are both pretty obvious statements that don&#39;t seem to be useful to say. The next statement isn&#39;t much better &quot;That human activity has caused climate change is not disputed by any scientific body of national or international standing.&quot; I&#39;m starting to get the idea they think these statements have great meaning. Let&#39;s go onto the fourth statement. &quot;The largest driver has been the emission of greenhouse gases, of which more than 90% are carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane.&quot; Wait, the largest driver of what? Climate change? Or climate change caused by human activity? They are skirting a very fine line of ambiguity between another insipid statement and a monumental yet nonchalant shift from statements very few people disagree with to one which is hotly contested.<br /><br />I&#39;m just writing this to give context.

By definition a fact is something that is evidence based and/or for which there is proof. What is science? What is religion? Take a general statement like "if a source receives any funding at all from the fossil fuel industry it is AUTOMATICALLY invalid". I cannot see how such a sentiment would fall easily into the category of being science based, but would easily fall into the category of religious thought. The fossil fuel industry has their opinion, so do climate alarmists. Ultimately, opinions are like assholes: We all have one and most of them are full of shit. Scientists? They have their opinions too, possibly to a lesser degree full of shit. Hopefully. It depends on the individual. Almost everyone used to think the Earth was flat or that Earth was the center of the universe. Saying the science of climate change is based on a million bajillion scientific papers only shows evidence that a lot of people are measuring and/or seeing something similarly, but consensus is not an argument for any scientific principle. As unlikely as it is, someone could come along tomorrow with a single paper that blows it all out of the water. Just because a person expresses an idea with a high level of emotion does not equal how objectively true their idea is. More emotion does not necessarily equal more true. More scientific papers expressing a certain idea does not necessarily equal more true. While it certainly adds to the body of data, it does not necessarily positively inform a good decision or conclusion. Also, group-think is a thing. How much does that impact the conclusions people, including scientists and politicians, have about what the data shows? And never forget correlation is not causation. Science, the scientific method, is a systematic process. Science is not the be all and end all, it is writing a story which is still being written. A story which helps clarify our world. Challenging a narrative about a pile of data is not "obfuscation". Point, counterpoint. A process of deductive and inductive reasoning is how good science works. A scientist is not out to prove their hypothesis to lord over others. They use a hypothesis to their guide research through a process to which structure (controls) and documentation are essential. Political and religious reasoning: "Hey look at this thing! There's a million bajillion of them! This means we should do X!" A claim is made. Which is a scientist more likely to say and which is a religious zealot more likely to say? A) Bullshit. B) Let me tell you what to think and do. Science is inherently skeptical. That's a good thing. Some person could say, "that data is cherry picked!" Another could say, "This data stands out to me, it calls into question other data and findings. What's going on here?". If there is good science, it will be investigated and explained, not discarded and shouted down. Religion discards and shouts down, science investigates and questions. Religion sees being challenged as a threat, science see being challenged as just part of the process. Science is not infallible though, especially practiced by a species which has been impacted for thousands of years by religion and superstition in countless ways: psychologically, educationally, socially, genetically, etc. Science is only as infallible as the person practicing it. To think otherwise is irrational, religious even. Does the climate change? Change is constant. Is CO2 a significant factor? It looks that way, but to what degree? Does it matter? So, the planet is warming, C02 happens to be going up as well, is that a good or bad thing in the aggregate for the time being? I don't know. Plants are loving it, the Earth is greening. Deserts and desertification covers 2/3rds of the Earth's land surface. CO2 can help massively to bring life back to these areas. There were civilizations covering the area where the Sahara desert is now. They didn't live in a desert. We can fix this though. Open up vast areas of land to swallow all the CO2 being produced.

It's BS attempts at manipulation like that which turn thinking people off and stop them from listening as much as it hooks the fearful in. It is change though, for sure. People fear change. Fearful people act irrationally. Fearful people are the first to fall back on religion, to "other" those who disagree with them. The first to cast labels on the othered, those "deniers" and "skeptics" and try to control them. To rationalize their fear and justify it by labeling it with positive names, calling it "Science" even. They are usually the first to use violence on those who don't agree with them, to hurt them and kill them. Fearful insane mobs shouting "do what we say or we'll kill you!" are a bigger threat than any likely climate change in the next 100 years. In the next 100 years (10 years easy if we focused on it) we will definitely have figured out LFTRs to use Thorium to replace the bulk of fossil and gas fuels for the next 1000 years. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uK367T7h6ZY In that next 1000 years we will no doubt figure out a way to harness fusion or harvest and effectively store solar energy in an orbital array to power the planet which will provide energy for as long as we don't kill ourselves. Scale up to larger time scales. C02 levels were easily at least 20 times higher in the geological past. The world didn't end. The Sun was also smaller then so maybe that worked well with the higher CO2. The Sun is growing constantly though. Earth will become uninhabitable if we don't move it. When are you going to start protesting about that? Long before then we will have colonies on Venus and Mars, perhaps farther. By the time the Sun grows to envelope Earth and Mars orbits, we will be long gone or have found a way to move the rocky planets to a more comfortable thermal distance and terraformed them into planetary paradises. Moving a planet: https://youtu.be/oim7VvUURd8 Ultimately, climate virtue signalers bitching and moaning and judging others are stupid and annoying. The world isn't going to end because of the current CO2 bogey man. The real threat is people acting malignantly on other people. Attacking "climate deniers" only makes you part of the problem by amping up hate and drama. "Climate deniers" are vastly people who want you to just leave them alone, but somehow they are evil just because they don't share your warped view about how things should be done. Stop being silly. Learn some patience. Keep your hands to yourself. Stop being afraid of change. Or don't. It's up to you. I'm going to follow the good science and not the fear mongering politics designed to reduce freedom and control people. Everything is going to be okay. :)	UCsZAU5Kjdq794tf4otKmi8g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsZAU5Kjdq794tf4otKmi8g	1	UgzcjwfDuT06mnk-hVV4AaABAg	j2d4oi

Swallow either of them whole and expect your stupidity to metastasize. The scientists in the Climategate scandal were exonerated by over a half dozen investigative panels. No fraud was found. Agenda-driven blogs and videos across the internet do not change that ruling.  The temperature data showing the warming trend WAS NOT CHANGED. They simply used thermometer readings, which are more accurate than tree ring data. They did this because the tree rings that were collected were not normal, revealing anomalies that are only found in far northern latitudes, where global warming is most intense, and which may have been affected by the global dimming the earth experienced from aerosol pollution a few years ago.  Denier media outlets presenting a mix of facts, cherry-picked data and some verbal sleight of hand should never be the last word in your education. Seek rebuttals from the opposite side. Make sure you've been told ALL the facts, not just those that satisfy your bias.

I have a gut feeling that plotting thermal energy would be far less noisy; and it would also be more relevant in measuring climate change than focusing on the resulting temperature (degrees). Thermal energy can go to many places, some of which have more thermal capacity than others. For example, the absolute thermal capacity of the oceans is so much greater than the atmosphere&#39;s total thermal capacity that perhaps atmospheric temperature measurments don&#39;t even warrant looking at.<br />Politically speaking, I feel I can relax now that Elon Musk is tackling the CO2 problem without too much help from governments. I considered myself a Democrat for many years because of the climate deniers&#39; embrace by the right; in spite of my leaning to the right in most other respects; but now I feel I can be a Republican again, as the right&#39;s stupid climate skepticism no longer matters.

Nature breaks its own rules whenever it wants. Science cannot avert a single thunderbolt. Western science is a product of the Apollonian mind: its hope is that by naming and classification, by the cold light of intellect, archaic night can be pushed back and defeated.&quot;<br /><br />Camille Paglia	UC-UOY0kLEDVF7tJewGmaZ5A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-UOY0kLEDVF7tJewGmaZ5A	0

Climate protesters are therefore asking for something both impossible to achieve, and useless.<br />We need to study the detailed dynamics of our weather system and find the catalyst mechanisms which would allow for a reversal of the current raising temperature trend - with interventions that are coherent with the structure of our industry and our society.<br />EDIT. As a sidenote, few reminders: the base temperature of the planet, the balance of the Sun radiation Vs the heath re-irradiated in Space without the effects caused by the atmosphere, is -20 °C. The greenhouse effect is shared by water vapour at 80%, and C02 at 20%. There a lot more to understand beyond the CO2 causation.

So you come to me and say "this thing weighs negative 3kg" and my response is "even my shittiest fucking scale couldn't possibly give an answer that wrong." As is with the case of whether an increase in IR absorbing gas in the atmosphere increases or decreases the equilibria temperature. The sign is positive, period.

And I'm not saying this to insult you or suggest you are stupid. You likely are very smart. But you are not a genius like me. Nor is Tim Palmer. Within academia the theoretical aspect of meteorology and climatology have been completely supplanted with "just so" stories that serve a marketing function. You might eventually realize that the only skills any (any and all) university meteorologists or climatologists (academics) bring to the table are the political skills of being good at not stating anything that contradicts what most people generally agree is sensible. It’s mostly jargon measured to fit the mold of science--the look and feel. But it isn’t real science in respect to the fact that they don’t actually define concise hypotheses, they don’t make much on any attempt to quantify or measure them, and they don’t do experiments. They just tell stories and train their student to do the same. It takes incredible political skills to get a Phd in the theoretical aspects of meteorology and climatology. I am just a physicist. I don't have the skills to create narratives that provide people like yourself with the false confidence that they understand what they don't.

But we don't. And if we did it would also show that the magnitude thereof would be miniscule. Even without a precise GCM any reasonable person could only conclude that the net effect of CO2 would be miniscule AND PROBABLY NEGATIVE TO OVERALL TEMPERATURE (since CO2 is instrumental to cooling in the upper stratosphere). But we don't. So you are just talking out of your lower orifice, like all global warming whack-jobs. The real truth is that climate fraudsters use the imprecision of GCM's to hide the fact that the effect of a 3 percent increase in a trace gas that only comprises 1/20th of one percent of the atmosphere--a gas which possesses wholly unremarkable thermal properties--is miniscule. (This is your chance to prove me wrong. Put up or shut up.) Global warming is for frauds and dimwits. No real scientist has a chance in this intellectual environment.

I would, however, gladly take a position with Exxon because, as an environmentalist and a genuine tree hugger, I recognize that the paucity of CO2 in earth's atmosphere does make it more difficult for plants and trees to thrive, and the products of oil companies do rectify the shortage--if only slightly--of this gas, CO2, that plants and trees breath to survive. I am also an atmospheric physicists who has studied the thermodynamics of the gases of the atmosphere and, as such, I recognize that the net thermal effect of CO2 is atmospheric cooling. And, as a humanitarian, I recognize that the greatest problem for mankind that clearly shows up in the fossil record is the glaciation of most of Europe and Asia and virtually all of North America.

Another thing to consider is that so many jurisdictions have already implemented significant climate change mitigation, so we are now in a phase of the climate change story where there is a clear shift away from coal power, where gas use has increased, and where there are carbon trading schemes (eg EU) that has resulted in money being redirected to tree planting etc. So, that also has to be taken into account. Some of the early models assumed that none of that was going to happen quickly and that there was going to be very little R&D.

You start by dividing the earth into 10 km x 10 km grids. Then you evaluate the complexity of the topography of each grid, and in the case of complex grid units, you make a sub-model at a 1 km x 1 km scale. The vast majority of the earth&#39;s surface has simple topography (think of all the oceans, plains and ice caps). It is mainly mountainous areas and narrow isthmuses and straits that are complex, but these areas probably represent less than 10% of the earth&#39;s surface.

In most engineering applications (and probably also weather and climate simulations), Finite Element Methods are the most versatile and most popular approach for numerical simulations and that is an "integral method".

CO2 is not responsible for warming and for that matter the idea of a &quot;global temperature&quot; is ridiculous. As a meteorologist, I experienced the pain of dealing with early 1 level models of barotropic and baroclinic design. Very basic. You climate modelers need a heavy dose of reality by putting out a forecast at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fkCo_trbT8&amp;t=8m30s">8:30</a> in the morning and having to explain away the hail storm that you didn&#39;t mention that hit the County officials big afternoon meeting. <br /><br />Without skill you have nothing. We live in an interglacial. We are lucky it is warm and livable; Ice age means miles of ice on much of our Earth and for a LONG time! Plants and life on Earth may have a tough time of it when that happens.<br /><br />PS: By the way; the explanation of the hail storm was this: We had 2 late-night time clusters of thunderstorms; one to our East and one to The South East. These systems collapsed and sent out weak outflow boundaries. That Meteorological phenomenon did not do much except at the 1 spot where they intersected. RIGHT OVER THE COUNTY MEETING!

Aside from the ocean acidification nonsense, they cannot tell us which organisms are going to die off, nor how CO2 is going to kill them. The CO2 levels have increased and decreased in the past.

The atmospheric carbon content of the earth has been much higher than the present levels for the vast majority of the geologic record, and this did not cause an extinction event except for the end Permian extinction event which was caused by a flood basalt eruption the size of Texas which occurred in the Siberian Traps and emitted megatons of volcanic ash, methane, sulfuric acid, hydrogen sulfide, and CO2 into the atmosphere. It must be noted that the CO2 was approximately 20 times the present levels. So no, we are not anywhere close to an extinction event caused by CO2.

PH is a logarithmic scale with neutral being in the center at 7 and anything lower than 7 being acidic and anything above 7 being alkaline, as I have previously stated. You cannot call a base an acid. A real scientist would know the difference and would not be making such claims. There is much propaganda in the CO2 control movement. That is not how it works. There can be no reaction occurring with the shells until the PH dips below 7 and actually becomes acidic. You may not like the coke analogy, but it is not truly an analogy as it is the same exact phenomena. The same holds true for soda water, which is nothing more than water which has had carbon dioxide forced into it under pressure. Buy two bottles and leave one out in the sun and put the other in the refrigerator for awhile and then open both of them. The warm one will spray all over the place while the cool one will not release nearly as much CO2. This is pure undeniable physics. The same exact phenomena occurs in the world's oceans. The water will only hold as much CO2 as is allowed by the temperature and pressure of the environment, regardless of the concentration of CO2 that is in the atmosphere.

If it was purely dependent on temperature and pressure the pH should be rising, not falling. We wouldn't see this and creatures dependent on calcium struggle, if sediments easily buffered the change in pH. Species alive today aren't adapted to lower pH and sure won't ever adapt at the current rate of change. I don't get the coke analogy since our oceans haven't been poured out of a pressurized bottle from the fridge. Before our oceans get more alkaline due to higher temperatures I'd expect sea life as we know it long gone already.

Carbon dioxide, when dissolved in water becomes carbonic acid, which is why some people are claiming that the oceans are acidifying, which is pure nonsense. The oceans are alkaline with a ph of about 8.1. Of course there are local variations, but the ocean is not acidic. The ocean could only be considered acidic if the PH was less than 7. 7 is neutral, neither acidic nor basic. A fluctuation of the alkalinity is not the same as acidification. The amount of CO2 held by the oceans is purely dependent upon temperature and pressure, but mostly temperature. The atmospheric carbon content can only have an indirect, temporary, and minimal effect on the oceans ph through the amount dissolved in rain. It is just like a coke, though. The warmer that can of coke is, the more CO2 is going to be forced into the atmosphere. The warmer the oceans become, the more CO2 is expelled and the more alkaline they become. Furthermore, most rocks and sediments which comprise the sea floor are alkaline in nature and would react with acids, neutralizing them.

The carbon content is supposed to do two contradictory things simultaneously: warm the globe and acidify the oceans. Warm water holds less carbon, not more. Just look at the Cretaceous period. It was both warmer and had a much higher atmospheric CO2 content, and shell bearing organisms thrived. Practically the entire geologic record had a higher atmospheric CO2 content than the present. The last million years has been the lowest on the geologic record. Mollusks and and other shell bearing organisms evolved in environments that had higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Furthermore, their shells are made of carbon. They literally need carbon to make their shells.

CO2 has increased approximately 1.5 parts per 10,000 parts in our atmosphere and that total increase occurred over a period of several decades. I have to date been unable to find any hard scientific evidence that the increase is the primary driver of climate change as is claimed.

I don't quite see how it relates, but I'll gladly address your new points. _"Mars has more CO2 % than Venus but it's freezing."_ First of all that's flat out wrong. The density of Venus' atmosphere at the surface is 65 kg per cubic meter, whereas Mars' atmosphere has less than 0.001 kg per cubic meter at its surface. Both atmospheres have a relative CO2 concentration of more than 90%, so that means Venus' total surface density (and partial pressure) of atmospheric CO2 is thousands of times higher than Mars'. Mars is also much further away from the sun than Venus, so the difference in solar irradiance is about *5-fold.* You can't ignore a 5-fold difference in heat from the sun! _"Atmospheric pressure is directly proportional to temp not composition."_ That's incorrect. For _ideal gases,_ pressure is proportional to the product of density and temperature according to the ideal gas law. Composition does indeed not really matter for the greenhouse effect though, only the individual partial pressure/density. So it wouldn't matter if for example all oxygen in the atmosphere (O2) was replaced by something else, the CO2 would have the same greenhouse effect as long as its partial pressure remains the same.

Venus has 100 times our pressure, Mars has less than 10%. Atmospheric pressure is directly proportional to temp not composition. That's why the Gas giants are so hot deeper down and in hot spots due to violent winds.

Just like that, a few ppm CO2 make the atmosphere opaque to certain frequencies in the infrared spectrum of light, thereby causing a greenhouse effect. This physical phenomenon has been understood for more than a century and it has never been refuted. Just the understanding has deepened and improved over time. 400 ppm is almost a pint (or half a liter) per cubic meter, and it's a far higher than what caused the depletion of the ozone layer in the 80s (< 1 ppm).

The mechanisms of how GHG&#39;s can have an effect on average temperatures is not in dispute. However, this scientist is making a fundamental mistake in elevating one theory by explicitly stating that the whole world is warming today only because of Man&#39;s small contribution to just one element. This is not a fact. It is a theory because there is plenty of counter evidence which demonstrates that temperatures have changed by the same magnitude over the same term of the thirty years rolling average at a time when CO2 levels didnt change. Therefore it cannot be categorically stated that the change in temperature of just 0.79C over thirty years today is only due to Mankind&#39;s contribution to CO2. Climate model scientists have applied a value to CO2 which they can adjust to demonstrate this variable is the reason for the temperature changes. If one reduces the CO2 variable value and increases another factor in the modelling like Insolation or the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect then the models will still have the same result, however the CO2 problem will simply go away. This is where politics can interfere with the science because who is it who makes the decission on how much value is applied for the UHI adjustment for instance and by how much? The same question can be asked for each and every other variable in the equation. <br />Don&#39;t be fooled by a mathematical model, it is only as good as the input that goes into it and there are plenty of contentious issues that surround the variables within the models. Many hundreds of world renowned scientists believe that the extreme climate predictions being claimed have gone too far. On this basis alone it can be said that climate scientists have got it wrong and need a rethink.	UCF6shV7CZCfTkfjMEfY-opA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF6shV7CZCfTkfjMEfY-opA	0

What drives temperature change is the SUN radiation and Orbits variation. Point. The main green house compound on Earth is Water (75-95% of the GH effect). Try to understand this. Without the correct amount of water on the surface Earth would be a &quot;frozen&quot; planet. Ian Clark paleoclimatologist explains it in 10 minutes: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDKSkBrI-TM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDKSkBrI-TM</a> if you have further doubts write a letter to Ian Clark and maybe he can explain you the details. I could explain it but i have no time. CO2 is only a minor minor green house compound on the atmosphere currently 0,04% -vestigial gas. And by the way, Water vapour gives negative feedback to CO2 effect through clouds. Its a &quot;magical&quot; compound climatizing Earth. The rest is mumbo jumbo nonsense pseudoscience spread by the &quot;man made&quot; climate change CLIMATEGATE IPCC/hokey stick mainstream pseudoscientists that created the climate cult and hysteria and the new global warming industry employing an army of people producing papers &quot;PAL&quot; reviewded within the delusional CLIMATEGATE comunity. This encompasses a huge amount of jobs in the Academia, Media and industry with the &quot;renewables&quot; and a huge CO2 WEB of interests worthing trillions of dolars. Its why this monumental pseudoscientific JOKE, the greatest of all times gets going.

In Fact your Graph is misleading and wrong. It comes from a misleading CULT site named "skeptic.... ". The name says it all. In fact reliable solar radiation observation and recording is a recent activity. We only have PRECISE reliable data available for some decades now. This real data which is available, most of them manipulated by alarmist sites , shows CLEARLY that Solar radiation peacked around 1999-2000 and decreased from there. https://i.stack.imgur.com/Is7eN.jpg . Its why we are in a TEMPERATURE PAUSE https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-xAdiohdkcU4/VjpSKNYP9SI/AAAAAAACa8Q/639el4qIzpM/s720-Ic42/monckton1.png since 2000, despite the fact that desperated alarmist industry keeps saying that temperature is increasing, and keeps fabricating all type of fake news, such as " the hotest month in history ( somewhere)" " The hotest temperature registered in Antarctida", etc etc. The thermometer temperature record only started around 1850 WHICH makes THIS TYPE OF HEADLINES DELUSIONAL. But if we look closely for what means the "Hotest Month" we see that IT DIFERS FROM "THE LAST HOTEST MONTH IN HISTORY" ONLY A COUPLE OF CENTS OF A DEGREE CENTIGRADE, THAT CAN NOT BE DISTINGUISHED FROM THE MARGIN OF ERROR of temperature measurements and recording! If we look for the "hotest temperature in Antarctida" we see that is simply fake news.

The world will keep on spinning and we will adapt or we will die. Otherwise, without equal treatment throughout the globe as far as restrictions aimed at changing the direction the climate is going, without that equal suffering there will be resistance to any action taken. In other words, good luck getting anyone to comply without equal suffering and equal benefit for all. And given human nature having a strong desire for self preservation.

We are after all, discussing a mean number that is taken over a range of about -60F to 120+F depending on were you are on the planet, at a particular elevation during a particular season at that location during a particular solar cycle, etc.<br /><br />And why do they always use that data set from the 1800&#39;s to now...what about the rest of the data from the last few billion or even millions of years? Does that not have a bearing on what our planet&#39;s CLIMATE has been doing and if we are really out of the ordinary based on all of that data?<br /><br />Would anyone spend their life savings to purchase stock based on 1 minutes&#39; worth of data...or would they pull up the companies entire data set and look at the trends and base it on that?

The basics are accurate and they both look right, but the reality is they are both wrong (23.4). Human reactions are often in a directly inverse realtionship to the importance/reality of any given situation. Climate Change is real, but it is not a massive problem - despite what the movies, the media, and vested interests have &#39;informed&#39; people. Worldwide crop (food) production yield per hectare has increased over 20% through CO2 increases (a +). USA has reduced CO2 outputs since 2012 (in total and %) more than any other country. But China is increasing theirs even more than USA is decreasing. Politics never solves problems - only real people do. The only known solution is Nuclear energy - fusion would be best - but safe fission is here now. <br />I Refuse To Panic or be Paniced - by either &#39;global warming&#39; or Covid19 or whatever is next.<br />&#39;The mind is everything and what you think, you become.&#39; Buddha.

I am pretty sure 1.000 wind turbines are cleaner than nuclear reactors when you consider everything, from construction to operation to manpower to maintenance and, especially, to the waste management. And I’m pretty sure a project to install and operate 1.000 wind turbines is both safer AND cheaper than a project for installing and operating nuclear reactor in the first place. Wind power obviously doesn’t care about the time of day, but by “on demand” if you mean the solar panels can’t produce power during night, well… We are discussing going global nuclear here, are we not? And if we went global solar, I’m pretty sure the world would be producing power night and day, as, obviously, there’s always some “day” somewhere. Similarly, winter/summer production differences would also be cancelled out by north/south energy income. Meanwhile, we should also mention that building and operating a nuclear power plant safely requires a certain degree of technological knowhow, which many developing countries lack, and which is completely non-existent in third world countries. These countries can’t make use of nuclear power safely, but they can safely install and operate clean energy sources. Furthermore, operating nuclear power plants also requires: nuclear fuel rods. Which are usually enriched radioactive materials that produce nuclear waste after operation. Enrichment process itself is being strictly monitored and regulated (quite rightly so) so that no dirty bombs or nuclear weapons can be developed by certain power groups. From this point onwards it becomes a political matter, the nuclear technology will never be distributed along the countries of the world but instead will belong to select few. The only option developing countries have is to have their nuclear reactors constructed, operated, and fuelled by private companies of developed countries, which opens a whole can of bags that science alone can’t resolve. In fact, science doesn’t have such a mission anyway! It only does tell the situation and leaves the decision to decision-makers. But even in the best case scenario where a technologically developed country installs industrial plants on developing countries, trains their people to operate it, it still often ends in disaster, like the Bhopal disaster in India. These countries can’t even handle the nuclear material in their medical devices properly! While we are on the subject, green energy sources require less manpower equipped with less technical knowledge to operate. The lower the amount of human interference, the lower the risk of human error or misconduct. All those set aside, you are also comparing a newly developing area of energy sector with nuclear power, which had a world war and then a lot of civil time and money investment put onto it. If the same amount of resources spent for nuclear power production is spent for green energy production, any and all problems you might associate with them could be solved. I would argue that solving problems associated with solar plants and wind turbines and energy storage are easier to solve than ensuring the safety and cleanliness of nuclear power plants running and being refueled all over the world. If we as humanity come to a junction trying to decide the future energy production paradigm for our world, is it not much more obvious that going clean energy is a much more appreciable way compared to the way which requires the handling and disposal of radioactive matter?

The distance and output from the sun has a slight effect on warming, as does the Earths orbit. ALL of these possibilities have been extensively studied and discounted as a cause for current warming. All of the evidence is freely available. If the worlds climate scientists are mistaken, where is your evidence ? Where is your evidence for a conspiracy ?

It has been shown that Alaska DOES warm in these periods. Their claim of continuous warming for the last 30 years is FUCKING laughable. Pinatubo blast in 1991 CAUSED Global COOLING thru 1993. A LOT of the cold records here were in summer 1993. MOST of the winter cold records here were 1883 to 1887, after the Krakatoa blast in 1883. There were also cold years after Mt St. Helens. The IPCC has been PROVEN to be a SCAM constantly adjusting their FAKE data. Their claim that a GSM's affects is ONLY temperatures is laughably IGNORANT. It is FLOODING in desert areas all through Africa and the ME. China is under water. Record cold and snow thru ALL the southern hemisphere and far MORE places too. These ASSHOLES need to be LOCKED UP.

UgzpdXrsxjDO6RX6cRF4AaABAg	2	1	2020-10-11 13:12:49	W. Kurt Dobson	For thinking people; ah, the great debate on climate change. <br /><br />One way to test whether this is an honest exchange of facts and ideas is to to seed these sites with facts and ideas that either support the narrative, or contest it. I have done this over the last week on at least forty of the major channels and taking one side or another. <br /><br />What I found is that usually within 48 hours, anything I say that doesn&#39;t support global warming as a crisis is removed, or edited down to only language that is neutral or supportive, while anything post that would support the argument stays. Makes one wonder where the money is coming from...<br /><br />From NASA:  Based on orbital variations, Milankovitch predicted that the ice age would peak every 100,000 and 41,000 years, with additional “blips” every 19,000 to 23,000 years. Three variables of the Earth&#39;s orbit—eccentricity, obliquity, and —affect global climate. But it&#39;s a lot more complicated than that. <br /><br />And, the last ice age was about 30,000 years ago. Interestingly humans didn&#39;t do so well because it&#39;s hard to migrate and one can show that there were less than 30,000 humans that survived through mitochondrial DNA analysis. Whales, insects and such do much better and have been doing so for 100&#39;s of millions of years.<br /><br />So, I totally believe in climate change... It&#39;s been going on for 100&#39;s of millions of years, since planet formation.  Long before humans arrived; and yep, the ice caps melt, ocean levels change and humanity gets huge disruptions, then everything freezes up and people must move south to survive.<br /><br /><br /><br />And, finally any huge heroic effort by humanity to change things one way or another would take another 100k years (one cycle) to measure the effect. <br /><br />I&#39;ll wait a few days and see which if any of my comments survive whoever has time and access to edit or eliminate my input.

What about the medieval warm period when vikings were living in Greenland? The million year ago period when CO2 was 7 times higher but temperatures were not? The fact that tornadoes have been pretty low in power and occurance for the past 12 years? What about polar ice not melting but actually gaining volume?

CO2 has risen by approximately 137ppm since pre-industrial times, and the warmer climate that increased GHG emissions create can absorb more water vapour. So water vapour is NOT a driver of climate change, it is a positive feedback. This is understood by those who understand climate science. "Warmest period was around 1930."

You adjust the past to fit models and use models (like the Russian ones that use far lower forcing for CO2) that post hoc fit the temperature that gets adjusted. So regardless of that how does the Drs Connolly work looking at radiosonde data going back decades affect this if the CO2 signal is NOT what claimed it would be from these very same models.

UgwYtRcrOjZPipvdQ0x4AaABAg	5	1	2020-10-05 17:01:42	Ma.Theresa Smith	The last 5 mins addresses the issue of a &#39;tipping point&#39; by which I understand this to mean the point at which the concentration of CO2 reaches a level which leads to irrevocable runaway heating. We know that CO2 levels historically have been at 2-3x current concentrations, yet no runaway heating occurred. <br /><br />While Prof Palmer does not state at what concentration he believes this tipping point occurs, the suggestion is we are close (a handful of years away) but no-one has suggested CO2 levels in a decade or even by 2100 will reach historical levels of say 1,500ppm. How can he credibly say that a tipping point will occur at levels of 600, 700ppm etc when the planet has experienced those conditions well before man arrived and no positive feedback loop occurred?<br /><br />Am really struggling with this basic point and would liked to have heard Prof Palmer&#39;s explanation.

My issues with current climate "science" are threefold, one solar activity and it's obvious causing of ice ages is ignored, secondly geology as a field is being excluded from the conversion, because geological findings seem to contradict current theories, and thirdly it's not actually clear to me at all that CO2 has a greenhouse effect. When I ask where the solar cycles that have influenced huge changes in the climate historically factor into the climate models, and why core samples show that CO2 levels and temperature have historically not always been linked, I'm viciously attacked. That's not science. "settled science" and "consensus" aren't phrases that belong in science. Ask a global warming acolyte when they think the next ice age will occur and they will become very angry. Why? So many ice ages are well documented, this isn't an argument. So what, are ice ages over now? The earth has been much hotter in the past, much cooler, and has had much higher CO2 levels than present levels, and the temperature and CO2 levels don't necessarily correlate historically. Nevertheless patterns are clearly discernable, and there's absolutely no reason to assume that these patterns just suddenly stop dead in the 20th century. The furthest I can concede to these people is that these patterns will continue, but with a small added effect from our activities. But how significant are these activities? They are significant in the short time scale climate change people insist on looking at, but on a larger time scale, they are very insignificant. Volcanic activity has for example emitted much larger amounts of "greenhouse gasses" in the past, and in many cases, even in human history, radically changed the climate. If you deny the possibility of a future ice age, you're off your rocker, and in the same category as young earth creationists. It's not a question of if, but when, and the when is predictable, and plenty of work has been done on predicting it. I'm not even denying global warming. I'm simply taking issue with the narrow and cult like direction science has taken on the issue. To me, they are actively fighting against the inclusion of critical data in their models. For this reason I cannot take this stuff seriously at this point in time. It's too politicised and too dogmatic.

We have both tree ring & ice core samples showing us the Earth was a lot hotter then today, as well as the data showing Earth is colder more often, with longer durations. Why does the climate change with the other cycles (precession of the equinoxes, grand solar minimums, etc.) We are in the beginning conversance of cycles right? Historical data show a peak just before & right after. Are we prolonging it? Maybe, if so, is that good or bad? Again, just ideas. Bottom line is, Still no major changes. The Vikings settled Greenland, the Tams were frozen. Extremes our generation have not endured, so it's hard to believe were burning up, when last winter I had to get my car stated for work at 26 below during the third bad winters in Wi. in a row.

According to the training manual of the International Ground-source Heat Pump Association, the temperature of the subsurface temperature gradient, below which temperatures never change and are constant all year long but above which the temperatures change over the seasons just as they do above ground can be calculated as the annual mean temperature of any given location, which is also the definition of the temperature of the climate. Since it is always the ground that heats the air, it should be obvious to everyone what the source of climate is and we have absolutely no control over the internal heat of this planet!

Deforestation <br />Each of these is arguably of similar importance to CO2 in terms of climate change.<br />Ramanathan has written extensively on the importance of particulate emissions on atmospheric convection. Convection is crucial for the Earth’s ability to dump excess heat to Space.	UCT3kRBiS8eg0KYPOvpx6S1g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT3kRBiS8eg0KYPOvpx6S1g	0

The climate will react with more convection when temperatures become warmer. This process skips the CO2 within the Troposphere and dumps the heat at the base of the Stratosphere where it escapes to space. More heat loss and more ice cloud reduces average temperatures. The machanism of the natural properties of the atmosphere opperates a bit like a safety valve. However if climate model scientists over state the value of CO2 in the modelling then they will always make CO2 the problem and the reason for political change.

No climate scientist ever forecast coastal inundation by 2020. Sea level rise plays out over centuries. The predictions that low lying coastal areas will be inundated relate to the latter decades of the 21st century. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-019-0531-8 https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-sea-level Equally, your suggestion that glaciers "should have been gone years ago" is erroneous. No research ever predicted the disappearance of glaciers so quickly. But disappearing they most certainly are, contrary to your false claim that they are growing. It doesn't take much time to research this. https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-glacier-mass-balance https://www.intechopen.com/books/climate-change-realities-impacts-over-ice-cap-sea-level-and-risks/a-study-about-realities-of-climate-change-glacier-melting-and-growing-crises You did at least get one thing right. Children today are being brainwashed about the dangers of climate change. The culprits though are not those who spend their lives researching the changes and publishing their findings in peer-reviewed journals. The culprits are to be found in the mainstream media, most notably the Murdoch-dominated rightwing leaning media.

Climatologists can&#39;t delineate how quickly the warming would be occurring minus the human species. Scientists are good at making predictions they can test and measure in a low entropy lab or in relatively short time intervals. Creating models and comparing them to real time empirical data. This is the wheelhouse of successful science. Earth climate models over long periods of time are incredibly complex and climatologists don&#39;t even know the multitude of absorption variables they aren&#39;t aware of as an example. Remember Chernobyl? Scientists predicted it would take generations before wildlife would flourish in that immediate area again. Turns out the Earth was far more resilient to such things than previously estimated. Think of the massive resources dedicated to short term climate models, better known as: meteorology. The funding and manpower of that industry dwarfs that of long term climatology and yet meteorologists still can&#39;t accurately predict short term weather patterns. Long term climate models involve more variables, (or should and don&#39;t) and yet climatologists claim to understand the science being conducted. We have been warming since the last ice age and the Earth has been through many rapid warming and cooling cycles in its history. The Earth has spent the majority of its timeline at higher temperatures. Climatology is a racket and if you study the history of science you will learn this isn&#39;t the first time humans have been wildly over their skiis in similar fashion. Humans are nothing if not egotistical creatures who believe they have the answers to everything. Throw in a complex issue that can be used to extract money and votes and you have the recipe for mass delusion.	UCJmMrUy3hjrO9GDUWWRKENA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJmMrUy3hjrO9GDUWWRKENA	0

Cutting back our production of greenhouse gases certainly can't hurt and I recognize the possibility that climatology may accidentally be sounding the proper alarm. I just know humans don't have anywhere near the grasp they are claiming to have on this subject. In fact, I think nuclear is our current best answer. There is a new type of nuclear power plants that is self sustained and self corrected and although nuclear power is controversial its actually the safest way to generate the vast amounts of power modern society requires.

This leaves the human content of atmospheric volume @.002%. The claim climatologists understand all the variables and absorption in high enough resolution to contribute causation is laughable. Tiny fluctuations and anomalies in Earths natural processes have far greater impact. Climatology is in it's infancy and is too complex for our current understanding of Earths systems. The fact meteorologist can't accurately and consistently predict short term weather patterns should inform you of something fundamental. Humans will look back on this era in climatology as junk science.	UCJmMrUy3hjrO9GDUWWRKENA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJmMrUy3hjrO9GDUWWRKENA	1	UgxB9TmZe6x2X2JQZ2Z4AaABAg	Ken Hiett

I'm not arguing humans aren't contributing to global warming, I'm arguing climatologists can't possibly know to what degree. You're claiming to know we wouldn't have continued to warm without human intervention? That's absurd and it's simply a fact Earth has spent the majority of its timeline at higher temperatures. Higher temperatures achieved through natural processes and through a multitude of variables. Known variables and undoubtedly unknown variables. You are also using quotes inaccurately.

These studies have suggested that while a grand minimum might cool the planet as much as 0.3 degrees C, this would, at best, slow down but not reverse human-caused global warming. There would be a small decline of energy reaching Earth; however, just three years of current carbon dioxide concentration growth would make up for it. In addition, the Grand Solar Minimum would be modest and temporary, with global temperatures quickly rebounding once the event concluded.https://climate.nasa.gov/blog/2953/there-is-no-impending-mini-ice-age/.......it doesn't say trade wind phenomena.Idiot.

Similarly he speaks of highly accurate reginal forecasts requiring stochastic modeling which in itself means variation.

As he explains; the goal of the models is to predict average global warming. NOT the fine details. If a picture of your face is very clear but doesn't show each and every hair and pore, is the picture an invalid representation of your face? I've been reading about climate change since the early 80s. Back then they predicted very closely the effects we're seeing today. We all (including you, if you can) need to wake up.

You can't return the heat to the sun. The science is very simple; CO2 when increased in the atmosphere captures more heat than less CO2 and the CO2 acts as an insulator that keeps the added heat in the atmosphere instead of radiating out to space. I think you have enough knowledge to THINK you are an expert but not enough to understand that you're not. It's called the Dunning Kreuger effect. Look it up. By the way, what is your educational level? Do you have a degree in climate science?

An experiment with a bare light-bulb filament in a vacuum-chamber will show you that the filament runs much hotter than if you fill the chamber with co2. That's because heat absorption cools a heat source. It's how we cool engines, by cool air(including GHGs) absorbing the emitted heat. In the same way that the - 18°C atmosphere absorbs heat from the 14°C Earth surface. The surface is both water- and air-cooled. Heat absorption in air is how you cool something. Simple, basic thermodynamics instead of climate doomsday-cult nonsense.	UCNyH4O3uweBSlz1kRBBU1fA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNyH4O3uweBSlz1kRBBU1fA	1	UgwaPqifoon-R3m539h4AaABAg	Emil Junvik

Heat waves, heavy downpours and sea level rise pose growing challenges to many aspects of life in the Northeast. Infrastructure, agriculture, fisheries and ecosystems will be increasingly compromised. Many states and cities are beginning to incorporate climate change into their planning. Northwest. Changes in the timing of streamflow reduce water supplies for competing demands. Sea level rise, erosion, inundation, risks to infrastructure and increasing ocean acidity pose major threats. Increasing wildfire, insect outbreaks and tree diseases are causing widespread tree die-off. Southeast. Sea level rise poses widespread and continuing threats to the region’s economy and environment. Extreme heat will affect health, energy, agriculture and more. Decreased water availability will have economic and environmental impacts. Midwest. Extreme heat, heavy downpours and flooding will affect infrastructure, health, agriculture, forestry, transportation, air and water quality, and more. Climate change will also exacerbate a range of risks to the Great Lakes. Southwest. Increased heat, drought and insect outbreaks, all linked to climate change, have increased wildfires. Declining water supplies, reduced agricultural yields, health impacts in cities due to heat, and flooding and erosion in coastal areas are additional concerns.

Two degrees may sound like a small amount, but it's an unusual event in our planet's recent history. Earth's climate record, preserved in tree rings, ice cores, and coral reefs, shows that the global average temperature is stable over long periods of time. Furthermore, small changes in temperature correspond to enormous changes in the environment.

These studies have suggested that while a grand minimum might cool the planet as much as 0.3 degrees C, this would, at best, slow down but not reverse human-caused global warming. There would be a small decline of energy reaching Earth; however, just three years of current carbon dioxide concentration growth would make up for it. In addition, the Grand Solar Minimum would be modest and temporary, with global temperatures quickly rebounding once the event concluded. https://climate.nasa.gov/blog/2953/there-is-no-impending-mini-ice-age/	UCBGKCSbOJFhizHBv_dtDu1Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBGKCSbOJFhizHBv_dtDu1Q	1	UgylnrO9yYNTUB9fcHN4AaABAg	N Allen

Hansen’s 1988 model ultimately predicted about 50% more warming for the coming decades than actually occurred, giving fodder to skeptics’ arguments that scientists were exaggerating the issue of global warming. But the issue with Hansen’s model wasn’t its physics, Hausfather and colleagues point out. The model assumed higher emissions of methane and chlorofluorocarbons, both potent greenhouse gases, than actually occurred. That’s in part because the model did not account for the future impact of the Montreal Protocol, an international agreement to phase out the use of chlorofluorocarbons in an effort to reverse the ozone hole. “If you went back and reran that model with the actual levels of CO2 in the atmosphere and methane and chlorofluorocarbons, you would have gotten a value that was indistinguishable from the warming that https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/climate-models-got-it-right-on-global-warming/we’ve actually observed,” Hausfather said.

We don’t need to go back to the Stone Age to reduce our carbon footprint. Believe it or not, we have all the technology needed to curb co2 emissions, but the reason nothing is happening is because we lack the will to implement change, and because of this, you completely misrepresent the solutions and conclude from your misrepresentation that we must go back to the Stone Age, that’s called a strawman fallacy. In case you didn’t know, the sun has been dimming, so how come the global average temperatures skyrocketed in that time? Natural climate change is also 1-2 orders of magnitude slower than what we’re seeing today. I’ve heard this argument a million times from climate skeptics and it is really getting old. Tell me that the spike in CO2 immaculately lining up with the rapid temperature rise is natural. Explain to me a non anthropogenic mechanism that accounts for this almost sudden increase in temperature, starting at the industrial revolution (and the sun can’t possibly explain this because like I said it has been getting dimmer.)

Now I know the reason, more low clouds and no rain.<br />This is caused by a weak sun (electromagnetic, no sun spots). Cosmic rays form the clouds.

Watch what happens when you talk about ice ages, medieval warm period, sunspot cycles ect. The reaction is usually quite vitriolic. I'm always surprised by this, seeing as these are all very well documented, and do not directly contradict the greenhouse gas theory. The greenhouse gas theory can quite comfortably exist in the same reality as these established facts, and they know it. These people have an agenda, and that agenda is threatened by anything that distracts attention from their message that we should all be very afraid, and must await further instructions from our overlords.

I do NOT agree, both based on the science and the fact that I have lived long enough to remember the late 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s when &#39;we all agree&#39; that global winter was coming. I have ZERO faith and most definitely not enough to tear down all the gas stations and freeze in winter : Because freezing to death in winter is a REAL CERTAINTY, where as the rest is speculation. Ecosystem collapse is not at all likely. As you look now there are succession zones from tropical, to neotropical , to alpine, neoarctic and in each zone there are particular species of trees, other plants vegetation AND there would be no collapse but a shifting of dominant species. Some areas of the earth would actually become more agriculture friendly , such as northern Canada and Russia. Longer growing seasons due to pushing back the first frost and last frost dates would diversify the species of crops that can be grown in the positive. With the great number of invasive species across the earth - the idea of collapse is ridiculous. Where is evolution ? Where is human migration ? It is just all incomplete...where is biological science, engineering, ecosystem ecology in all of this ? Where is historical certainty in this ? Is this compatible with the idea that we are in phase that has lasted for thousands of years of global warming ? Global warming caused the end of the last ice age and made possible human existence ? Global warming enabled large portions of N. America and Europe from the ice sheets during the most recent glaciation ? I mean really...isn&#39;t this at its base just another load of manure ?

Also, most models are biased to some degree and climate models are no exception. That is why much of the global heating forecasted back in the 60’s and 70’s hasn’t been realized. Just means the models have to be recalibrated in accordance to the current observed data.	UCsA-UcCKil0tIpciH7esCrw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsA-UcCKil0tIpciH7esCrw	0

UgzLaBBvqlEB_t2QiPp4AaABAg	4	1	2020-09-20 08:11:51	Max Tabmann	&quot;The predictions have no uncertainty attached to them&quot; - this was a killer question actually, because he answered that the variation of unrepresentative models output represents the uncertainty. Only a fool could say that. What he missed out, and you missed to follow up on him is the sensitivity to changes in model parameters. This is the usual method, to change some parameter like e.g. forcing of cloud cover and observe how the output changes depending on input. Because these are highly coupled nonlinear equations, the change in output normally exceeds the change in input by orders of magnitude, and this is the better way to estimated uncertainty. It is also called error propagation. So simply from that you can conclude that climate science either does not know what they are doing, or they know and hide from the public. The other serious mistake is to leave out serious wheather events in the past in order to make believe, these events are increasing now, which is statistically wrong. Serious wheather events are decreasing - not increasing.	UCpgJ2pPUrxklN3-TvAXZjaA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpgJ2pPUrxklN3-TvAXZjaA	0

Not believing in your view means to admit that our whole population is mislead by science and that is something hard to accept. The whole story changes if politics and paid scientists make statements about your own special field and you can tell in every sentence, that these statements are wrong. Thermodynamics is an old and well established fundamental science, developed by Maxwell and Boltzmann, scientists much smarter than most nonames today and if you just compare what popular books said 50 years ago and books say today, it makes you shake your head. There is no option to join the majority in believing something wrong. Its true that the magnitude of public deceipt now has reached a level as high as never before, but similar intentional misconceptions have happened all through human history and it is only a matter of time until this fabric of pseudo-physics falls apart. If you are not a scientist, then look for contradictions and if you find one, then its time to start to doubt. If you have no relation to basic physics at all, look for statistics lies. Are there really more wild fires than 50 years ago? Are there really more extreme weather events? Untouched historic records tell a different story. One very simple example of cherry picking: Why do we hear about a warming artic every week but noone reports about increasing ice cover in the antarctic? see - https://data.meereisportal.de/maps/latest/extent_s.png - If science is open, it should tell the whole story.

There is nothing to discuss any more about the basics, only the details are under discussion. If you would just open your eyes you would see. But this is the problem science always had. Galileo told the cardinals to look through the telescope to see that the sun has dark spots. They told him that they don't have to watch, because they know that there are no spots. Same with you Max. Your problem is a very human one. If you would accept what everybody sees, if you would accept what practically all climate scientists agree on then you would have to change your life.

The question is man made or not? If you keep observing the weather for 15 more years and also read some serious literature on meterology, you will find out that earth climate is nothing stable. It changes roughly every 40 years, it did so in the past and it will do so in the future.

Or building them like mushrooms.<br />Or throwing billions at Thorium research?<br />And why aren&#39;t we preparing for both cold AND warm climates? What do we do I the planet hits a real ice age when our grandchildren reach age 45?<br />We are advanced, we can produce the structures needed.<br />Nuclear reactors don&#39;t produce co2, and thorium would even degrade nuclear waste we amassed in the past using nuclear energy.<br />Als long as this is not part of our daily reality I say: I&#39;m not convinced by consensus. I&#39;m not convinced by political opinions.<br />I want facts, stone cold, 100%.

The reason why we haven't moved away from CO2 producing fuels towards nuclear and renewables is the deliberate actions of the fossil fuel industries to prevent it. (See: "Merchants of Doubt" book and documentary). We aren't preparing for the most likely consequences, never mind the more unlikely ones like an ice age. The consensus in global warming and subsequent climate change, which results from it, follows a discussion between experts who have spent their careers collecting evidence. They build models to represent that evidence, using the model to try to predict future outcomes - and then observe the results to fine-tune the model. One of the earliest, by Exxon scientists in 1982, predicted the current global surface temperature rise surprisingly accurately compared to measurements taken today. The fossil fuel industry chose to go ahead and continue to promote fossil fuels as the primary source of energy regardless of the damage they knew it would cause. Wildfires, drought, floods and other extreme weather events like frequent hurricanes - which generally don't occur as frequently are now part of someone's daily life. It may not have happened near you yet, but you should at least assess the risk in your area.

So let's assume each model would have the same trend, then shifting the reference period in time would not change the picture, but just the values on the y-axis (so 0 would be found in the reference period). In case the models have different trends (they have, but usually this effect is minor) the order of models will change. Yes you can construct a way to make thinks look completely different (has been done in the discussion of the hiatus a lot) as you always can cheat in statistics, when you push the assumptions into an unreasonable state. So effectively: Minor changes in detail, but the general outcome is the same.

Without the correct amount of water on the surface Earth would be a "frozen" planet.

I could explain it but i have no time. CO2 is only a minor minor green house compound on the atmosphere currently 0,04%. And by the way, Water vapour gives negative feedback to CO2 through clouds. Its a "magical" compound climatizing Earth. The rest is mumbo jumbo nonsense pseudoscience spread by the "man made" climate change mainstream pseudoscientists that created the climate cult and the new global warming industry employing an army of people producing papers "PAL" reviewded within the delusional CLIMATEGATE comunity.

UgwTOT1h4RfgxorKnNJ4AaABAg	1	1	2020-09-14 13:42:03	Allen Loser	Existing methods of determining a global mean temperature have too many degrees of freedom to be credible. <br /><br />Temperature data is gathered at thousands of locations using disparate methods of measuring and recording the local temperature. Methods of measurement range from mercury column or alcohol column thermometers to varying types of electronic temperature measurement. Equipment used at a single location may be replaced over periods of decades. Thousands of data sets must be calibrated in order to combine them into a single data set. <br /><br /> Weighting of individual data sets must be applied. If I recall principles of data statistics correctly, the number of degrees of freedom increases with the square of the number of data sets and the number of individual calibration and weighting factors which must be applied.<br /><br />The locations at which data sets are collected are not evenly distributed across the surface of the Earth. There are large areas for which no data is collected. Interpolation of temperature data from other areas in which data was collected further increases the number of degrees of freedom.<br /><br />The reported global mean temperature can be almost anything which you wish the result to be if the researcher(s) choose(s) a suitable set of calibration, weighting and interpolation factors along with specifying a confidence interval which yields a desired result. <br /><br />Specification of a 90% or 95% confidence interval widens the range of uncertainty in the stated global mean temperature. A result of a 0.2C change in global mean temperature is meaningless when a 90% or 95% confidence interval is plus or minus 2C.<br /><br />NASA reports from several years ago reported global mean temperature at a confidence interval of 35%. Doing so narrowed the reported range of uncertainty. Doing so falsely suggested a high level of precision. A 35% confidence interval means that there is a 35% chance the real measurement is within the stated range and a 65% chance the real measurement is outside the stated range.<br /><br />I don&#39;t buy it that the reported global mean temperatures are credible.

That is to measure the temperature of an entire hemisphere of the Earth with a single set of measurements. Astronomers have been measuring the average temperature of an entire hemisphere of other planets for more than a century. The original method was to place a thermocouple at the focus of a telescope. Spatial resolution of a thermocouple is poor. A thermocouple cannot distinguish IR radiation from the equator of another planet from IR radiation from one of the poles. This is advantageous for obtaining a planet-wide average. The same principle can be applied to the Earth. Newer, more precise, instrumentation than a thermocouple is available. Degrading spatial resolution to the necessary degree is only a matter of hardware and software design. Place satellites in orbit at the Lagrangian points 60 degrees ahead and 60 degrees behind the Earth in its orbit around the Sun. The Sun, Earth and satellite form an equilateral triangle at these Lagrangian points and are (generally) stationary with respect to each other. Small changes in orientation and distance due to eccentricity of Earth's orbit about the Sun are well understood from orbital mechanics and are regular with the annual motion of the Earth and Sun about the common center of mass. An entire hemisphere of the Earth and of the Sun are visible to a satellite at one of these two Lagrangian points in the orbit. A detector with low spatial resolution can measure the IR radiation (temperature) of an entire hemisphere with one set of measurements. Changes in solar irradiance can also be tracked in real time from the Lagrangian points and correlated in time with measurements of the Earth's temperature. Measurements from one Lagrangian point correspond to four hours before local solar noon at a point directly below the satellite. Measurements from the other Lagrangian point correspond to four hours after local solar noon at the point directly below the satellite. The second satellite measures the temperature of the same spot with an eight hour delay. The temperature of that spot should rise during the eight hours of daylight. Seasonal temperature variations are averaged in since both North and South hemispheres are included in a single data set. Day versus night variations are averaged in since the data sets are collected at the same time, four hours before or four hours after local solar noon, for each data set as different locations pass under the satellite. Use of two satellites allows for cross-calibration. Every planetary orbit has five Lagrangian points. Another is located along a line between the Earth and the Sun. From this point measurements can be made at local solar noon at a point below the satellite. Another is located along the same line but beyond the Earth. From this point measurements can be taken at local solar midnight at a point below the satellite. The remaining Lagrangian point is along the same line but on the opposite side of the Sun. This location is useless for the proposed purpose since the Earth is not visible to the satellite from that point. Station-keeping at these three other Lagrangian points is more difficult since they are unstable equilibrium points. The two Lagrangian points 60 degrees ahead and behind the Earth in its orbit are stable equilibrium points. Station-keeping requires fewer adjustments and less fuel. Lobby your congressman to provide funding to NASA to design, build, launch, monitor and maintain these satellites in order to obtain a body of credible global temperature data. Better yet, hire SpaceX to do the work using private funding.	UCJIYgTQhhSTnpzx7piiqJyA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJIYgTQhhSTnpzx7piiqJyA	1	UgwTOT1h4RfgxorKnNJ4AaABAg	Allen Loser

I am on the edge of the boreal forest and parkland region in Canada and so I guess it always has been a transition area, but the ecosystem that is 300 miles south ( grasslands) will be the one in 50- 100 years ( hard to know, probably the latter) here. Anyway the noise is change and is converting to another climate system regionally, but I guess what is so unknown is how that one 300 miles to the south now adapts and or shapes and then feedback loop adapts to the topography here. More forest fires etc in the change period, has already started. So in short we can see the regional change from a global mean for sure.

Much bigger and missing portions of the puzzle are the variations of the sun and impact of volcanoes and absent is our early understandings and needed assumptions in the model are absent therein.

At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fkCo_trbT8&amp;t=1m13s">1:13</a> Prof Palmer states that ALL climate models are based on the <b>assumption</b> that &quot;increasing carbon dioxide is increasing the surface temprature.&quot; This is called &quot;cognitive bias&quot; and is the root of all evil in science. I&#39;m surprised you didn&#39;t call him out on this glaring example. If the base assumption is biased (and/or incorrect), then the resulting model is as meaningless as climate models based on a Flat Earth - <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/116/39/19330">https://www.pnas.org/content/116/39/19330</a> - no amount of fudging can make them accurate.

Ugz9Dsqs9Guwn6q6EQ14AaABAg.9DP2FdJH50T9DxLRyJdVBJ		2	2020-09-23 14:07:49	Mark Richardson	Incorrect. Without water vapour the amount of rising temperature (by CO2 alone) would be much lower (and water vapour is a much better greenhouse gas in terms of effect than co2 itself). But water vapour depends basically only on temperature. So it gets warm and the amount of water vapour rises non-linearly with it. So to know the amount of water vapour on the globe you basically only need to know the temperature (at least on global average). That's why everyone talks about the other greenhouse gases (like CO2, but methane and some others as well), because they are the ones who increase the warming "externally" to the system. So when you increase the other greenhouse gases, temperature will rise, with it also the water vapour, which will increase the temperature even more. Of course you have also counter effects and it depends on where you are looking in the atmosphere, but that would be probably too complex.

However Dunning & Kruger also noted that the more you learn about a subject the less confidence you have to about the mid point in knowledge, then your confidence starts to rise as you truly become an expert in that field though it never raises to as high as the ignorant persons confidence level. When grafted (x axis confidence, y axis knowledge) it looks like a crooked smile or reverse bell curve.

And there are limits, as to the benefits of CO2 regarding plant growth and ave temp as well as nutrient content.....this is essentially a bell curve with optimum temp being in 60 to 70F degree range, and as one might expect natural selection would reflect adaptation to the natural range of CO2 over time at between 180 to 280 ppm. But you got half of your last point (4) correct......any source of CO2 absorption would be beneficial at the moment....because CO2 at present levels is NOT our friend.

UgxRPZccBlpjfCUzWVt4AaABAg	1	0	2020-09-09 02:33:30	Brad Dixon	Great discussion. Couple of things came to mind while listening, 1) in the book Chaos by James Gleick, he mentioned even having sensors every foot apart would not produce the knowledge needed to accurately predict the weather, of course due to Chaos. I heard Prof Palmer mention Chaos, but too many times addressing parametrizing approximations, hence seeming to leave out Chaos. 2) the other thought has to do with processing. In image understanding with computer vision, the original techniques (random forests, etc) produced limited results, but when going to convolutional neural networks, huge strides have been made. It struck me that each of the existing nodes could be treated as an image pixel, and the same CNN used to process and make predictions. Any thoughts around something like that?

Chaos creates bounded random fluctuations and branching points that mostly get washed out by the averages. For neural networks, a quick research in google scholar "neural networks climate change" give results that go back to 1999, and a 2010 review of the field : https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11434-010-4183-3.pdf. I did not read the whole thing but the obvious critic of neural networks is that they are black box, over-fitted functions, and that their construction is more craft than science, all of those things being quite scary for most scientists, even though they do have an edge when it comes to modeling badly understood nonlinear systems. My guess is that neural networks could play a niche role in modeling specific subsystems of the climate for which we don't have proper mechanism based models.

I do agree we should reduce emissions of all pollutants because we dont know their long term effects. I just think humans should prepare for many things like asteroids or comets that could block sun for years and cause famine. We need better food storage for years to avoid famines because all manner of possibilities exist in the historical record.

Perhaps the political pressure for accuracy requires more planning, funding, and research (theoretical and otherwise) so saying &#39;we don&#39;t know&#39; rather than &#39;this is the best we have&#39; might might return the ball to the national politicians to at least fund to find out? - We all know global international political exercises obfuscate and delay the results through national self interest... perhaps the physicists approach of the &#39;spherical cow&#39; may give better results (given &#39;this is now&#39;, add CO2, &#39;this is what will be&#39; if all else is kept constant) - It seems like we are trying to describe a person, or the temperature of a gas, by giving the velocities and positions of their atoms - we know that is an impossible task - we need a theory of the emergent properties - a &#39;CERN for climate modelling&#39;. It is telling that genuine error bars have not been attempted.	UCVxryEb4rYxmdCpeTXDxENg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVxryEb4rYxmdCpeTXDxENg	0

Simple. Too simple in fact because humans can&#39;t stand simplicity, it gives us nowhere to hide. The complexity of science provides limitless opportunities to distort the conversation one way or another. I&#39;m NOT advocating giving up on science, not at all.

While you run around with your henny penny response and you accuse me of these things? I have a graduate degree in Natural Resources Management, so no I'm not "uneducated". Knowing what the "right temp" is is not a "silly question". It is the right question to ask. Here is why: People like you boil down "weather" and "climate" to 1 single number for the entire planet. You obviously understand that weather/climate is variable when you said "This decade, the drastic weather patterns..." yet you insist on looking at just 1 number to determine that things are going haywire. This is utter nonsense scientifically speaking. If people like you insist on using 1 number to describe the entire globe, then you have to determine what that number SHOULD be. As for your drastic weather vindicating scientists you are not correct in your BELIEF. Weather is made up of averages and within those averages we have outliers and "once in a xxx period" events. Just because we have a few of those events SOMEWHERE on the globe it doesn't mean scientists are vindicated. Weather recording globally to the extent we have now has only been around less than 100 years. We don't know how often these events occur globally in relatively short periods of time. We don't know if these rare events will continue. When you combine the lack of historical knowledge and the unreliability of the models it is premature to say scientists have been vindicated. AND I will throw in that the "drastic weather" you claim has been happening is over-hyped by the media and you allow it to fit your narrative, meaning you BELIEVE that the weather is more drastic when it really isn't.

It may not be perfect, but for thousands of years, current conditions sustain life admirably. Scientist have predicted with great iaccuracies that even a few degrees of ocean warming will cause havoc to our weather system. This decade, the drastic weather patterns all over the globe vindicate these scientists. For those not in the scientific field, the credibility of any scientific work is in its accuracy in prediction. If it predicts accurately, you've got a winner. So far, the scientist have been way off. But not in the way skeptics think. The forecast catastrophe is happening frighteningly much sooner than predicted. lnstead of 2050, it is hitting us in the face now, in 2020. Glacier melting, double stage 4 hurricanes at the same time. almost hell on earth fires due to drought conditions, etc. So while the uneducated fiddle with silly questions, Rome burns and the ones that can save us are sidelined.

It’s an intellectual bait and switch scheme. If asked believers will supply you with a mountain of data. The data will do little more than vaguely suggest some alarming eventualities in the indeterminate future. If you then ask them to delineate the connection to carbon dioxide you can then expect to be called all kinds of derogatory names implying that you are self centered and don’t care about future generations.

This warming thereby allowed Vikings to travel further north than had been previously possible because of reductions in sea ice and land ice in the Arctic. However, evidence also suggests that some places were very much cooler than today including the tropical pacific. All in all, when the warm places are averaged out with the cool places, it becomes clear that the overall warmth was likely similar to early to mid 20th century warming. Since that early century warming, temperatures have risen well-beyond those achieved during the Medieval Warm Period across most of the globe....https://skepticalscience.com/medieval-warm-period.htm Regarding the cooling predictions: There were 7 times more predictions of warming, you simply ignored those studies. Nobody said you would die from heat, you are a liar. The past hundred years are important because of the rapid warming and high concentrations of CO2 leading to more warming, this did not exist pre-industrial revolution. What happened thousands of years does not matter, at all as the causes of the cooling and heating of the planet was much different from today. Mankind does not thrive in warmer climates when the warming leads to drought and extreme weather such as flooding, it disrupts food production, etc. and the warming is much more rapid now so that adaptation is much more difficult due to the rapidity. There are plenty of youtube videos where climate scientists "debate" idiots like you that know nothing, at least they try but the ideas you hold are so deeply entrenched that you choose to maintain the traditional falsehoods over the clear science.

(incidentally, he founded Skeptical Science which ought to make one doubt its veracity).” Skeptical science always references peer-reviewed literature from long-established science journals to support their content, which is written with measured academic caution. If you are challenging Skeptical Science, then you are challenging the scientific research on which Skeptical Science base their content. Your man Tony Heller cherry-picks old newspaper articles and writes like an emotionally-challenged shill in the National Inquirer, deploying idiotic terms such as “fraudster” and “hoax”. Which source do you think is a more dependable outlet for objective content on climate research? Before you answer that, go back to the comments you read on Skeptical Science, reflect upon the content and the tone of the debate being carried out there, and then go compare this to the comments being written by your fellow Heller disciples. It’s an instructive and eye-opening contrast. “Quantifying the consensus on anthropogenic global warming in the scientific literature. This built on earlier work by Oreskes The Scientific Consensus on Climate Change. Cook's study found that 97.1% agreed that greenhouse gases were partly responsible for global warming. However, 66.6% of the papers reviewed expressed no opinion either way.” I’ve seen this lame argument before. If you were to read a bunch of research papers on the topic of bears, how many would you expect to see the need to explicitly endorse the notion that they shit in the woods? The climate debate has moved on. You have been left behind. “The problem i have is that Climate Science is highly complex and is not properly understood.” That, as you rightly point out, is your problem - not that of those who spend their lives studying the climate. “Earth has seen the same variations in temperature in the past when humans were not a factor.” Correct, but this does not preclude the notion that humans can impact their environment. “Yet Climate Science that relies on CO2 as the driver cannot explain this.” Climate science doesn’t “rely upon” CO2 as a driver. Atmospheric CO2 is both a driver of climate change and a positive feedback. This is not a contentious position. For long periods in the past, the climate was not being driven by atmospheric CO2, but by one of the other two fundamental factors that drive climate: Insolation and aerosols/particulates. “What we do know is that the changes are not major or an immediate problem...The economic consequences will be limited as the IPCC admit.” That’s not what “we know”. It’s what YOU THINK. And the IPCC admit no such thing. https://www.ipcc.ch/srccl/chapter/summary-for-policymakers/ https://e360.yale.edu/features/as-climate-changes-worsens-a-cascade-of-tipping-points-looms https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03595-0 “Economic assessments of the potential future risks of climate change have been omitting or grossly underestimating many of the most serious consequences for lives and livelihoods because these risks are difficult to quantify precisely and lie outside of human experience. Political and business leaders need to understand the scale of these ‘missing risks’ because they could have drastic and potentially catastrophic impacts on citizens, communities and companies. Scientists are growing in confidence about the evidence for the largest potential impacts of climate change and the rising probability that major thresholds in the Earth’s climate system will be breached as global mean surface temperature rises, particularly if warming exceeds 2°C above the pre-industrial level. These impacts include: Destabilisation of ice sheets and glaciers and consequent sea level rise; Stronger tropical cyclones; Extreme heat impacts; More frequent and intense floods and droughts; Disruptions to oceanic and atmospheric circulation; Destruction of biodiversity and collapse of ecosystems. Many of these impacts will grow and occur concurrently across the world as global temperature climbs. Some of these impacts involve thresholds in the climate system beyond which major impacts accelerate, or become irreversible and unstoppable.” Source: https://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/The-missing-economic-risks-in-assessments-of-climate-change-impacts-1.pdf “The general consensus, which is supported by a growing amount of evidence, suggests we should act sooner rather than later to avoid potential future costs. Successful mitigation policies will necessitate actions from all parties.” Source: https://www.schroders.com/en/sysglobalassets/digital/us/pdfs/the-impact-of-climate-change.pdf “As Lomberg and others (including the IPCC) humans are adaptable and can cope with change as they have done in the past.” You love your dodgy sources, don’t you? Lomberg is another character who has produced some very questionable research. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwMPFDqyfrA “we are already adapting, there are fewer lives lost through major catastrophes, fires, floods, tornadoes, etc than at any time in history.” Since none of your other claims stand up to any scrutiny, would you like to provide any evidence for this claim? “what we should be careful about is to adopt an unproven theory that may result in more problems than it purports to solve.” The “theory” that man’s emissions of GHGs are warming the planet is not a theory.

UgzMud7EoJNFkUjkA5V4AaABAg.9DBRuBpB-Lx9Ila1qEmPPb		0	2021-01-21 07:10:09	Jonnie Park	@Gregory Jones ​ “He makes statements that are patently unproven and yet accepts them as gospel. This is the same as a religious belief and it seems you adhere to the same one.” When you make accusations like this, which question a scientist’s fundamental honesty and integrity, it behooves you to validate such a condemnation with an example. Let’s see one. “I find it staggering that you give as proof articles that actually contradict one another.” Says the guy who cited Tony Heller as a source! https://realclimatescience.com/2017/08/todays-featured-climate-fraudster-zeke-hausfather/ Sorry mate, but I cannot take anyone who cites Tony Heller seriously. I recommend you have a look at the dismantling of his specious garbage at the hands of Potholer 54 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLjkLPnIPPw&t=1255s or Mallen Baker. Here is “How Tony Heller fools his audience.” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtvqwO-fb6w “If you had bothered to read Zeke Hausfather you would have discovered that the models did not predict Climate Change accurately.” Without any kind of evidence, I will dismiss this comment as nonsense. As the article states, some models were more successful than others: “The results: 10 [of the 17] of the model projections closely matched observations. Moreover, after accounting for differences between modeled and actual changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide and other factors that drive climate, the number increased to 14. The authors found no evidence that the climate models evaluated either systematically overestimated or underestimated warming over the period of their projections. “The results of this study of past climate models bolster scientists’ confidence that both they as well as today’s more advanced climate models are skillfully projecting global warming,” said study co-author Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA’s Goddard Institute of Space Studies in New York. “This research could help resolve public confusion around the performance of past climate modeling efforts.” “If you had read the comments on the skeptical science you would note that the author had misread the data” So you’re taking comments from anonymous posters as gospel? Did you fact-check them? How did “the author misread the data”? “also, they quote other articles and papers including those of the IPCC that refute the idea that these models work.” Why don’t you cite them if you think that is the case. Let’s have a closer look at them. “AS for the article by Buis, i suggest you read the original source by Zeke Hausfather. It was only by tweaking these models to retrospectively fit the data that they worked. But to quote from Von Neuman: "With four parameters I can fit an elephant, and with five I can make him wiggle his trunk.” That’s sweet. And I bet you have satisfied yourself that this cute quote is an absolute killer debunk of the entire body of evidence that underpins what scientists have discovered about our impact on our environment. Just stop yourself for a second and have a think about what you’re saying: Deniers: “Climate models don’t work!!” *Climate scientists refine models. Models work. Deniers: “You’re just tweaking there models to make them work!! Fraud!!” “Even when they do fudge these models they still do not fit the further back you go as Carrick pointed out in his response to the Skeptical Science article.” As one would expect, because the further back one goes, the more one has to rely upon proxies. What did you make of the responses to Carrick’s post, incidentally? “it must also be stated that Zeke Hausfather previously has failed to state that the data he uses has been changed over the years which has resulted in the past temperature becoming cooler. Stations at higher latitudes, rural stations, and ones at higher elevations have been dropped in favour of urban and marine influenced stations. https://realclimatescience.com/2017/08/todays-featured-climate-fraudster-zeke-hausfather/” If you can find a credible source for your comments, I will take them more seriously. As long as you quote Tony Heller, and not peer-reviewed papers, your comments can be dismissed. Heller is simply not an impartial, trustworthy arbiter of the science. If he knew what he was talking about, he would be publishing his work for peer review. He knows exactly what he is doing, which is why he doesn’t do that. “firstly the 97% statement made in the yaleclimateconnections paper is a complete myth.” It isn’t. Multiple studies confirm this. You just don’t want to believe that climate change is a real and growing problem, so you are in complete denial. https://skepticalscience.com/global-warming-scientific-consensus-intermediate.htm I tell you what. Why don’t you post here one – just one – peer-reviewed research paper from the past two or three years which fundamentally challenges the consensus that man’s emissions of GHGs is driving global warming to dangerous levels. We will wait..	UCNbqDbC3eFJ0uvaq8LEZuQw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNbqDbC3eFJ0uvaq8LEZuQw	1	UgzMud7EoJNFkUjkA5V4AaABAg	Rashad Saleh

This is the same as a religious belief and it seems you adhere to the same one. I find it staggering that you give as proof articles that actually contradict one another.

Even when they do fudge these models they still do not fit the further back you go as Carrick pointed out in his response to the Skeptical Science article. The IPCC itself quoted in their report on the physical science basis This means that the trends in the models used here are likely biased high compared to observations". it must also be stated that Zeke Hausfather previously has failed to state that the data he uses has been changed over the years which has resulted in the past temperature becoming cooler. Stations at higher latitudes, rural stations, and ones at higher elevations have been dropped in favour of urban and marine influenced stations. https://realclimatescience.com/2017/08/todays-featured-climate-fraudster-zeke-hausfather/ You then claim that "he is right to reflect the universally-held view among climate researchers that mankind's activities are to blame for the current warming." firstly the 97% statement made in the yaleclimateconnections paper is a complete myth.It derives from a paper issued by John Cook in his review of papers on climate change. (incidentally, he founded Skeptical Science which ought to make one doubt its veracity). Quantifying the consensus on anthropogenic global warming in the scientific literature. This built on earlier work by Oreskes The Scientific Consensus on Climate Change. Cook's study found that 97.1% agreed that greenhouse gases were partly responsible for global warming. However, 66.6% of the papers reviewed expressed no opinion either way. Of the rest, it was included if the paper accepted that humans had ANY effect on the climate. Nevertheless, 64 out of 12000 papers did claim that Humans were the major contributor to climate change - Hardly 97%. Follow up researchers found that only 41 of the 64 actually expressed that view. worse still many of the supposed papers were not papers but press releases prior to any research. Almost all Climate Scientists accept that Human Beings change the climate. the question was always to what degree and how much. Prior to the mid 20th century, there is no consensus as to anthropogenic increase. This is why the IPCC stated that "More than half of the observed increase in global mean surface temperature (GMST) from 1951 to 2010 is very likely1 due to the observed anthropogenic increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations" https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/WG1AR5_Chapter10_FINAL.pdf The problem i have is that Climate Science is highly complex and is not properly understood. Earth has seen the same variations in temperature in the past when humans were not a factor. Yet Climate Science that relies on CO2 as the driver cannot explain this. What we do know is that the changes are not major or an immediate problem. As Lomberg and others (including the IPCC) humans are adaptable and can cope with change as they have done in the past. The economic consequences will be limited as the IPCC admit. we are already adapting, there are fewer lives lost through major catastrophes, fires, floods, tornadoes, etc than at any time in history. Does that mean we should not strive for a cleaner environment, of course not. Nor does it mean that we should not do more research into climate. what we should be careful about is to adopt an unproven theory that may result in more problems than it purports to solve.

I notice this scientist does not give any examples of what he claims, nor refer you to where his assertions can be tested. He states that climate change models of late have predicted accurately which is contentious. He then backtracks and claims well they have predicted a trend but have not got them right. His religion obscures his facts. He argues that humankind has caused it mainly, again contentious, and does not reflect any historical evidence." I think you misunderstood the point of this interview and confused it with a research paper, and when you make fatuous comments such as "his religion obscures his facts", your credibility disappears up your arse. Whether you like it or not, Palmer was right about the accuracy of climate models. https://skepticalscience.com/climate-models.htm https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2943/study-confirms-climate-models-are-getting-future-warming-projections-right/ And he is right to reflect the universally-held view among climate researchers that mankind's activities are to blame for the current warming. https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2020/03/causes-of-global-warming/ If you think there is a more plausible explanation for the rapid warming we are witnessing right now, let's see it.

The Sun is in a cooling phase We are getting less radiation from the Sun. But we are warming. No credible climatologist argues we are not warming due to CO2. The only debate is at what rate. Don't bother coming back unless you can find a climatologist that says CO2 is NOT a greenhouse gas.

But that paragraph is a mere tune up for what you said: "The climate of the earth has always changed for different reasons and Co2 has saved us from extinction. People are adaptable, there is no huge crisis. The world will not end ". You are completely clueless as to the following: the rate of CO2 build up in the atmosphere has occurred not in the vast geological times to which you allude in your statement, but in a mere 100 years or so, this following hundreds of years of stability, no, the earth hasn't changed in the way it has and that is your problem. You don't recognize the difference between merely surviving and the suffering occurs.This is about a vision of the earth that is kind to species, including man. A vision that recognizes that it's better not to have a struggle to provide food or to not have to fight ever-intense fires, weather volatility on a much greater scale than has been experienced before by man. In short you are supercilious, look up the word you asshole. You are a naysayer to what most people hold dear . Finally, those scientists to which you refer are much more and increasingly certain of where the climate is going and looks dire. Only an ill informed person would claim that CO2 saved us from extinction, as if the planet was suffering from a deficit of CO2 and suddenly CO2 saved us from doom. That is a horrible misread of climate history as we never lived in a time when CO2 wasn't present enough to sustain our needs, lol, stupid upon stupid.Fuck you. And yet you deny , after asserting a relationship between co2 and man, that the inverse could lead to our demise or at least make living more difficult and unpleasant. Shut up you ignorant idiot.

There is a problem with replication in Physics, medicine, and chemistry that is why we have a difference between laws, hypotheses, and theory. Peer review is flawed as many studies demonstrate. Science like any subject is flawed. Even the greats in Science doggedly refused to change. AS for it not being Political of course, it is as even Scientists themselves admit. You claim that he does not use the term huge, no he does not because if he stated that it would weaken his case. Yet Results from a wide range of climate model simulations suggest that our planet’s average temperature could be between 2 and 9.7°F (1.1 to 5.4°C) warmer in 2100 than it is today. so what is a 485% difference if not huge. Graphs are misleading until we see all. they have been wrongly used wrongly in the Climate Change debate by both sides. People who study Climate will admit if they were objective that really it is their best guess. it does not qualify as Science in your terms. In reality, it matters little, The climate of the earth has always changed for different reasons and Co2 has saved us from extinction. People are adaptable, there is no huge crisis. The world will not end and silly talk from the likes of Professor Palmer about whether Humans can survive at these temperatures and humidity. He could claim that in certain areas it may happen but then that happens now. However, no one will know for 30 years.

In other words the mean temperature increases steadily and the variation happens around the increase of the mean over time. Look at the graph, damn, it's right there. Finally the process of science is not political, it's a process whereby results are reviewed and replicated. What politics does with the data, how policy changes with science is another story.

Throughout History Science has mainly been affected by politics. The problem your arguments have is that Scientists acknowledge that Co2 is not always the driving force, especially throughout History. My understanding was that they are stating that the present increase was as a result of humans increasing the amount of Co2 in the atmosphere. Just what the effect will be they are unsure especially as even Palmer notes the variations are huge. Being a sceptic as Science on the right states is part of science for it is the sceptics that generate advances in Science.

I don't have a problem with either. I just want a healthy dose of scientific skepticism. Based on the remarks from others responding to me, I guess I touched a nerve.

Science is apolitical so your appellation is a tell. The time frame we are interested in is post industrial revolution to present with the consequence of global warming aka climate change as a result of CO2 forcing. As to the contention that the sun is the culprit, and according to NASA, not so: One of the “smoking guns” that tells us the Sun is not causing global warming comes from looking at the amount of the Sun’s energy that hits the top of the atmosphere. Since 1978, scientists have been tracking this using sensors on satellites and what they tell us is that there has been no upward trend in the amount of the Sun’s energy reaching Earth. A second smoking gun is that if the Sun were responsible for global warming, we would expect to see warming throughout all layers of the atmosphere, from the surface all the way up to the upper atmosphere (stratosphere). But what we actually see is warming at the surface and cooling in the stratosphere. This is consistent with the warming being caused by a build-up of heat-trapping gases near the surface of the Earth, and not by the Sun getting “hotter.” No, it isn't the sun, nice try on placing more importance on your political agenda than the science.

Nothing to do with organised religion. there is enough Science out there to disprove this fact or to cast severe doubt on this. In fact, it could not be proven for at least 30 to 50 years and the costs of this religion to mankind are phenomenal. Trillions of pounds will be wasted. For what? Even if they are right the impact to Humans will be minimal. as Lumberg. (who accepts the Climate Science ideas) and his coterie of nobel prize winners point out the approach is all wrong. Scientists in the past have clung on to their erroneous beliefs as though it was religion. They cannot admit that their premise is wrong when presented with historical or contemporary facts that challenge or disprove their theories like a religious zealot they invent some new idea to support an even more tenuous theory. Climate change is happening the reason why is yet to be proven on a macro scale. Should we invest more in making the earth cleaner as Lumberg etc states of course! There have been too many scientific panics in the past, Climate change caused by mankind is a hypothesis, it is not a theory and it is not a law.

UgzMud7EoJNFkUjkA5V4AaABAg.9DBRuBpB-Lx9E7OQAcAMrv		5	2020-09-27 21:05:26	Rashad Saleh	Since there have been now multiple comments criticizing me personally as being lazy, a liar, a caveman, uneducated, closed minded, etc, I would like to respond. First of all, principles matter. Principles matter when you decide to calculate 1+1=2, when you decide to use gasoline for your car but water for your plants, and when you are building models to predict climate change. In this interview I heard a fascinating discussion about the current principles used for predicting climate change and how they are formed and being tested. But principles also matter in morality. Here is one that alluded you: Forming judgements about people must be based on the facts of reality. Calling Bill Gates lazy is unjustifiable given the facts about his life, and calling Ted Bundy a humanitarian does not go well with his criminal record. And, someone who forms judgements unscrupulously is definitely not the rational voice you cleverly pretend to be. What justification do you have in calling me “lazy” and “living in a cave”? How much can you know from my comment to conclude that? What just men do is give the benefit of a doubt when they don’t know, rather than go on assuming things that just so happen to be exactly the thing they had in mind. What a powerful tool! How it always works! If you assume what you already think, it always turns out to be the correct assumption, because you already knew it! So, you trolls, quit making assumptions and just read the comment again and take it for what it says: This is the first time that I heard a scientist talk about climate change, and the undeniable fact of reality is that I don’t have to be lazy, uninterested, uncurious, or closed minded for that to be the case. Because then why am I here?	UCGfd8j8--3zF_UdADYXL4Tg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGfd8j8--3zF_UdADYXL4Tg	1	UgzMud7EoJNFkUjkA5V4AaABAg	Rashad Saleh

He states that climate change models of late have predicted accurately which is contentious. He then backtracks and claims well they have predicted a trend but have not got them right. His religion obscures his facts. He argues that humankind has caused it mainly, again contentious, and does not reflect any historical evidence.

Kidding... The experimental cases about co2 only show one side of the coin. When you heat the experiment. Temperature is higher but will it stay higher when the heat is turned into cold? Co2 is very important for all life on earth and is a wonderful gas. It communicates with all elements - soil plant's water animals incl us. When was the last time you went into a deep forest after a cold night and the Sun starts to send energy- how the trees engine turns and consuming co2 which is all around with up to 800ppm?

Water vapour being the greatest green house gas, but nature can manage cloud but the balance is changing due to sea surface temperature, less forest, and us releasing sequestered CO3.  @Inklebonker 1  wow a twelve monthly cycle, and that's not reactive ! This whole idea of normalising forest burn, rather than moist leaf litter decomposing to peat, and so to carbon and eventually to coal, all securely locked away, because as we all know a healthy living Planet covered in PLANTS 93 million miles away from our fusion energy source, over produces photosynthetic carbon dioxide which would have a minuscule yet perceptible cumulative destabilising effect on the atmosphere, creating an over warming, (as we are seeing) if its not sequestered for ever underground, to release more would be catastrophic, that's the kind of action we need rather than winter back burning, so you see how long term this needs to be, sustainable means for ever, not just to 3100 or what ever.

We really do not have an accurate understanding of the total energy from cosmic and solar sources the are diverted for our planets biosphere. It makes sense to me that we can explain things like the loss of northern sea ice and the warming of the Arctic by the increase of energy, other than solar irradiance, being pulled into the Arctic by lines of flux of our planet. As the magnetosphere reduces we will see continual warming of the Northern regions independent of CO2.	UCksUPFv-llO9E2yQI3eUfrg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCksUPFv-llO9E2yQI3eUfrg	0

A cycle of La Ninas is about to kick in and global temperatures will drop sharply. The pause will be back this decade and may even turn into cooling.

The actual problem somehow lies within Navier Stokes and constructing accurate models is really really hard even with quantized lattice models. <br /><br />Also, there is usually no talk about global maxima. How do we know that this trend keeps happening? This is actually a big fallacy. There is not enough data (no, having just a few variables for several thousand years is actually not enough for a complex problem like global climate, also what about ocean dynamics? we dont have any real thing to simulate that). No reason to really think that we will reach a global maximum, maybe it&#39;s just local and it will go down again due to some unknown rebound effect. <br /><br />We don&#39;t know enough and no supercomputer can fix everything (This sounds like the collider argument: &quot;We just need a bigger machine&quot;).<br /><br />And now just my intution talking: The model kinda (eerily) looks reaaaally linear. I know, its not supposed to be linear but it really looks linear. And, if supposed it&#39;s (somehow) linear, how do we know that the error is not rising with a higher linear factor than the real data itself? This would lead to a major problem, being: We cant say shit.<br /><br />I hope I&#39;m wrong but it really doesnt look that convincing for me.<br /><br />Thanks for this video Dr. Hossenfelder, it goes deeper than most political nonsense.

So, why should the CO2 not get back into the atmosphere, where it used to be before?<br />There are archaeological findings that there was a jungle in the area of now Sahara desert. And that requires significantly higher CO2 levels than today. And green land was green thousand years ago, before it turned into a glacier.<br />The climate panics just assume that the climate is fundamentally unstable, and it will turn over it it get out of balance just a little bit. This is obviously not true, or the earth would have tipped over long time ago. And on top of that, the climate panics assume a ten-fold self-reinforcement of human influence of the human effects of CO2, for which they have not yet found any credible physical explanation.<br />Instead, climate scientists conduct social studies, in which 97% of self-proclaimed &quot; climate experts&quot; vote democratically that there is a &quot;significant impact of human activity to global climate&quot;. And most of the participating &quot;experts&quot; were social scientists. For a social scientist &quot;significant&quot; means &quot;extremely large&quot;, while for a physicist &quot;significant&quot; means &quot;very small, but barely measurable&quot;. But since that stupid internet poll, there is a which hunt on climate sceptics going on.<br />So, overall, climate science is not a natural science, because it is considered blasphemy to question the assumption. We are facing a new dark age in which we will loose the achievements of our civilization.	UC7Nvw7MnsRWgRHxdqr6LRyA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7Nvw7MnsRWgRHxdqr6LRyA	0

If you want to believe that this is a potential catastrophe, biosphere or otherwise. fine by me. You are in the majority. Nothing i or others can say will change the PC majority interpretation....... unless we do discover how to model climate change accurately and distinguish the natural factors from the man made. And then from this new super model, extrapolate how the biosphere and otherwise will be affected. But in the meantime there are those of us who look at the data and say "we cannot be sure of the man made component, quite obviously. We cannot even predict the ice ages!! Those were climate and biosphere 'catastrophies' on a much much larger scale. They were not 'fine details' lost in the innacuracies of present climate models. We dont know what the holocene was for example. Not a bloody clue!!. We dont know why the ice ages didnt come back. Not a bloody clue." Then some of us also say "what is so necessarily bad about a few degrees of climate change? Is it necessarily a catastrophe, biosphere wise?? The PC mainstream are predicting all kinds of terrible effects. Are their predictions any better than there climate models? Quite obviously not." You wrote "Undoubtedly chemical pollution is a huge threat to the biosphere, no question about that. But shouldn't we also factor climate change into that?".... and that for me says it all. Why? Why should we factor climate change into that??? The fact that for you it is so obvious that they should be conjoined and can be 'factored' together says it all. Man made climate change is the given driver for you .... and anything else however different should be factored into that. Right there is the revelation of your bias and the bias of the maiinstream. The biosphere has coped with far far greater changes in temperature than predicted by the PC government corporate backed climate scientists. Chemical pollutants in earth, air and water as produced by man? Where is the evidence that this is a 'factor' that can be extrapolated from previous climate change? It is completely new. At the primary level it has nothing to do with climate change at all. If man reduces global temperatures via PC carbon tax or otherwise..... the chemical pollution 'factor' remains barely touched. You dont have to believe in one to believe in the other. Your belief in man made global climate change dwarfs the general chemical factor. And i know methane and carbon dioxide are chemicals, but the whole 'carbon tax global warming' agenda focusses it to temperature effects and edits out the general chemical pollutant problem via a gross over simplification to carbon dioxide. I am more than willing to agree that carbon emmisions may significantly increase global temperatures. But i dont agree that the evidence has been produced. I am more than willing to agree that an increase in global temperatures may have profound and damaging effects. But i dont agree that the evidence has been produced. What i dont agree with is this PC focus upon carbon emmisions at the expense of what seems to me to be a much more worrying problem of chemical pollutants generally. There are no climate models for that for obvious treasons! Climate models miss it completely. Why would we look for man made biosphere catastrophe in carbon emmission climate change? Why would a culture do that using mainstream propaganda? ....To look away from biosphere catastrophe caused by other man made activity. It is a mainstream PC diversion ... and it has worked.

Most of these scientific claims about man made global warning are corporate and government financed. Whether accurate guesswork or innacurate guesswork, the aim is to bring in a carbon tax. The science cannot predict the background changes and fluctuations, so how can you predict the man made element? And even if true .... whats wrong with man made global warming??? why would it necessarily be a bad thing? These issues are brushed under the carpet. Just be a good citizen and trust the government and corporate backed science ... and accept the coming carbon tax.

As far as I know the sun activity is taken into account, and it is a minor correction. As for signals, he did say that global indicators are consistent with models and a rising global temperature trend, be it mean surface atmospheric temperatures, ocean temperature, glaciers melting etc ... At this point we can at most say that estimating the effects of climate change at the regional scale, that is the stuff that actually matters, is barely within reach of the current tools. Thus we don't know exactly at which point, in term of global mean temperature or greenhouse gases emissions, the consequences will go from bad but manageable to plainly catastrophic.

Naturally you dont have to make it just one parameter, you can probably do better with multiple, like say this region has 50% cloud coverage in day 100 of the year, this now is a 2 parameter version of it, and naturally will give better results. How far and exactly how you do this process is the choice of the researcher. Depending on how good or accurate the parameterization is, you get some divergence in the predictions of the overall model.

The science required to understand the alarmism is “political science” (follow the money, follow the pressure exerted on the researchers). His claim their models are trustworthy is laughable. Remember when data came in showing nearly all their climate models were overstating the warming. IPCC responded by claiming the warming was happening at the bottom of the Ocean without any change at the Ocean surface (a shocking denial of the laws of thermodynamics that say energy change inside a volume must pass through the surface). <br /> Sadly, these scam artists have forced the increase in electricity price so high, many industries shut down and moved to low cost electricity in China. China loves coal. Listen to this guy claim the science is settled that the CO2 will cause the climate to irreversibly flip while admitting they never actually modeled tipping point changes. He is an alarmist who claims 3rd world migration to Europe is because climate change and not because people simply wanting in on the benefits of a supportive advanced economy. If youwant the truth, then interview the founder of Greenpeace Canada (Patrick Moore, look up his interviews on youtube before they are suppressed). Mann’s private emails that leaked proved he was intent on corrupting the data to push his alarmist agenda and intent on suppressing true science that would discredit his agenda.

Some increase in snow is expected and consistent with AGW - basic physics as warmer air can hold more vapour which then snows on the ice sheet. But as you can see, the data is showing that the melt where the glaciers hit the ocean is very significant and the glaciers are moving faster. But these are facts that fly in the face of what you want to hear, so make sure you dismiss them and hold onto the ONLY study that shows what you want to hear. Although you don't even want to listen to all of what Zwally has to say: "The good news is that Antarctica is not currently contributing to sea level rise, but is taking 0.23 millimeters per year away,” Zwally said. “But this is also bad news. If the 0.27 millimeters per year of sea level rise attributed to Antarctica in the IPCC report is not really coming from Antarctica, there must be some other contribution to sea level rise that is not accounted for.” And is Zwally a Climate Change denier - hell no.

What has happened in Antarctica since 2008? And what do other studies show? Or do you simply instantly dismiss any study that doesn't suit your own cult? Here is the Arctic Ice Volume: http://psc.apl.uw.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/schweiger/ice_volume/BPIOMASIceVolumeAnomalyCurrentV2.1.png Oh, that does not look good! Maybe Greenland is better? https://www.pnas.org/content/116/19/9239 Oh - if you don't want to read sciency stuff, just go to the figure 3 - pretty obvious. And data is through to 2018 (not 2008). Oh, that is also not good. Which brings me back to Antarctica. It would be great if warmer air resulted in more snow accumulation on Antarctica, (warmer air can hold more water vapour which can lead to more precipitation) but it doesn't appear that it will if you tke the time to look at more than just ONE study. https://www.pnas.org/content/116/4/1095 And https://www.skepticalscience.com/argument.php?a=21&p=4 See the IMBIE 2017 Chart. "Between 1992 and 2017, the Antarctic Ice Sheets overall lost 2,720 giga-tonnes (Gt) or 2,720,000,000,000 tonnes into the oceans, at an average rate of 108 Gt per year (Gt/yr)." Zwally's results which rely on an assumption that the surface is ice (it is often snow which is not as dense) are in contrast with more recent GRACE studies which makes no assumption as it uses gravity so isn't as adversely impacted by whether the surface is fluffy snow or sold compacted ice.

Antarctic land ice is INCREASING in totality and contrary to science deniers, Antarctica ice is not increasing Ocean levels, it is DECREASING Ocean levels. Sadly, you are another example of cult fanaticism that promotes a catastrophic end times with a determined will to reject science. I will proudly stand with Galileo against religion that rejects science. I find it ironic that the Green party calls themselves “green” when they are against CO2 which is known to increase vegetation around the world from deserts to food crops and Tomato growers who pump additional CO2 into their greenhouses to greatly increase yields. Read this and weep, or set yourself free from fear ... your cult leaders have you deceived. Antarctic Peninsula A new NASA study says that Antarctica is overall accumulating ice. Still, areas of the continent, like the Antarctic Peninsula photographed above, have increased their mass loss in the last decades. Credits: NASA's Operation IceBridge Map showing the rates of mass changes from ICESat 2003-2008 over Antarctica. Map showing the rates of mass changes from ICESat 2003-2008 over Antarctica. Sums are for all of Antarctica: East Antarctica (EA, 2-17); interior West Antarctica (WA2, 1, 18, 19, and 23); coastal West Antarctica (WA1, 20-21); and the Antarctic Peninsula (24-27). A gigaton (Gt) corresponds to a billion metric tons, or 1.1 billion U.S. tons. Credits: Jay Zwally/ Journal of Glaciology A new NASA study says that an increase in Antarctic snow accumulation that began 10,000 years ago is currently adding enough ice to the continent to outweigh the increased losses from its thinning glaciers. The research challenges the conclusions of other studies, including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) 2013 report, which says that Antarctica is overall losing land ice. According to the new analysis of satellite data, the Antarctic ice sheet showed a net gain of 112 billion tons of ice a year from 1992 to 2001. That net gain slowed to 82 billion tons of ice per year between 2003 and 2008. “We’re essentially in agreement with other studies that show an increase in ice discharge in the Antarctic Peninsula and the Thwaites and Pine Island region of West Antarctica,” said Jay Zwally, a glaciologist with NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and lead author of the study, which was published on Oct. 30 in the Journal of Glaciology. “Our main disagreement is for East Antarctica and the interior of West Antarctica – there, we see an ice gain that exceeds the losses in the other areas.” Zwally added that his team “measured small height changes over large areas, as well as the large changes observed over smaller areas.” Scientists calculate how much the ice sheet is growing or shrinking from the changes in surface height that are measured by the satellite altimeters. In locations where the amount of new snowfall accumulating on an ice sheet is not equal to the ice flow downward and outward to the ocean, the surface height changes and the ice-sheet mass grows or shrinks.

As temperatures rise, even a little bit, the air is able to hold more moisture in it, and this change causes more turbulence which causes more clouds. Since the absorption of heat to this planet is greatest over the deep dark oceans and clouds reflect the most; the 2 buffer most of the rising CO2 temperature increase models predict. Then you have that rising sea levels from the last glacial period (technically it is not confirmed that we are out of the ice age) will reach a tipping point and shutdown the thermohalid conveyor belt pushing warm equatorial waters to the north pole. Then because of higher CO2 levels, we will avoid another glacial period, which I think is a better occurrence.	UC81KLawrg3NGL-K-XLZUVHA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC81KLawrg3NGL-K-XLZUVHA	0

So far they are not reducing the increase in heat in the atmosphere or the ocean. As long as there are ice caps we are in an ice-age. What we call the ice-age generically is the last glaciation. Forcing Earth outside its natural balance is an extremely risky business. Warming at 10x the post-glaciation speed seem insanely foolhardy.

If you drive down the highway and burn 3 gallons of fuel in an hour, thats the same as running 75 space heaters on full blast for that hour. Now when you look at all those cars as piles of running space heaters you have to ask where that heat goes. We make plenty other sources of heat too, and it would take time to radiate all that out.

Waste heat enters the atmosphere as infrared radiation and infrared coming from Earth is what excites CO2 creating and trapping more heat. So industrialization in general is contributing but the big effect is coming from CO2 and if we scre the pooch, a lot of methane could be released. That is beginning as the tundra thaws but there are massive amounts of frozen methane in the oceans that could be a huge problem.

It does not always mean the same thing. It could mean that, as you increase one variable X beyond a certain point, you encounter a region of much higher sensitivity, where very small changes in X lead to much larger changes to Y. Or it could mean that, as you increase X and Y increases with it, then reducing X does not lead to reduced Y until you have reduced X far below the point at which the original rise in Y occurred; in other words, hysteresis, where drawing the behavior of the function, you see a loop.<br /><br />And it can get more complex. The rate of change of X may change the relationship, as can many other things.<br /><br />We should be very suspicious when that term is used, unless it&#39;s in a very qualified manner.

Vor allem würden wir allerdings überhaupt eine effizienten Kreislauf von Wasser in der Atmosphäre bekommen können. Denn der scheint mir durch die Einflüsse der modernen Zivilisation (hier Mobilfunk-Infrastruktur und andere hochfrequente Strahlungsquellen) erheblich gestört zu sein.<br /><br /><br />Dafür gibt es diesen einen banalen Hinweis:<br />Die Temperaturkurven aus den Messdaten gehen zur gleichen Zeit deutlich nach Oben, wie die elektromnagnetischen Strahlungsquellen auf der Erdoberfläche an Flächendeckung zunehmen. Seitdem es den allgemeinen Mobilfunk als Infrastruktur gibt, steigen die Temperaturen auch überdeutlich an.<br /><br />Und die möglichen und wahrscheinlichen Auswirkungen der elektromagnetischen Strahlung auf die Atome und Moleküle des Atmosphärengases als fluide Masse.<br /><br />Ja, zur gleichen Zeit nehmen auch die Quellen von CO2 global immer mehr zu. Und CO2 ist natürlich ein Teil des Problems (weil Klimagase Wärmeenergie aufnehmen und abgeben können). Aber man kann natürlich auch nur das CO2 aus der Rechnung nehmen und so zu einer niedrigeren Temperatur gelangen, anstatt die elektromagnetische Strahlung aus der Gleichung zu nehmen (die da aber ja gar nicht in den Simmulationen enthalten ist / zu sein scheint). Die Frage ist nur, wie Effizient diese Strategie gegenüber der Verringerung der elektromagnetischen Strahlung ist. Ich nehme an, das beide durchaus relevante Einflüsse sind (obwohl das CO2 mit 400 ppm so gar nicht danach aussieht) . Zum einen kann die Erwärmung höher ausfallen, weil mehr CO2 enthalten ist (und mit der Wärme in die Atmosphäre eingetragen wird), zum anderen kann die Erwärmung auch höher ausfallen, weil bestimmte Frequenzen der elektromagnetischen Strahlung sehr effizient die Wärmeenergie-Übertragung/Verteilung innerhalb der Atmosphäre erhöht, sodass es zu weniger effizienten Wärmetransport zwischen den Atmosphärenschichten kommt (Stabilisierung der gebildeten Atmosphärenschichten).<br /><br />Erklärungen, das die Sonne doch die größte Quelle von elektromagnetischer Strahlung sei, funktionieren nicht. Denn deren Strahlung wird durch die Erdatmosphäre und das Erdmagnetfeld umgeleitet und zumindest im relevanten Frequenzbereich unterbunden. Dahingegen flächendeckende bestrahlung durch Mobilfunk-Infrastruktur genau diese Aufgabe der Atmosphäre und der erdmagnetfelder unterwandert, indem sie künstlich hergetsellt werden und in einem sehr effizienten Frequenzbereich die Atome und Moleküle in eine homogene Eigenschwingung versetzen, die dazu hinreicht, eine homogene Schicht mit homogener Temperatur zu erzeugen, weil die Wärmeenergieübertragung durch die erhöhte Eigenschwingung der Atome und Moleküle stark und effizient erhöht ist, sodass die Wärmeenergien im einzelnen Atom oder Molekül nur noch unzureichend dazu hinreichen, das dieser Wärmetausch zwischen den Atmosphärenschichten effizient genug stattfindet, weil die Auftriebswirkung in den Partikeln durch die enthaltene Wärmeernegie immer geringer ausfällt, da sie sich zu schnell in der Atmosphäre auf die anderen Teilchen überträgt und ausgleicht - die Entropie also künstlich verstärkt/erhöht ist.<br /><br />Zudem kann es duchaus möglich sein, das diese stabile Schichtenbildung durch elektromagnetische Ladungspotentiale verstärkt wird, sodass die erwärmte untere Atmosphärenschicht wegen ihrer durch Bestrahlung aufgeladenen umstände deswegen nicht wie erwünscht nach Oben aufsteigt, weil die Schichtenbildung durch Ladungsaufbau verstärkt wird, sodass eine große Schicht/Volumen nur zusammen aufsteigen würde können, das aber durch schwerere und dichtere Atmosphrenschichten darüber verhindert wird, weil diese das großvolumige Gas der unteren Schicht nicht druchlässt/eindringen lässt, denn es will/kann durch die Ladungspotentiale an sich selbst gebunden nur zusammen aufsteigen, aber nicht als einzelnes Teilchen.<br /><br />Ein Indiz für solche Bedingungen ist der urbane Stadtraum, über dem sich regelmäßig ein Mikroklima erzeugt. Mutmaßlich auch deswegen, weil es aufgrund von bestimmten Einflüssen auch eine gewisse &quot;Stabilität&quot; dieser Atmosphärenschicht ergibt, die aus gewissen Ladungspotentialen einen höheren Zusammenhalt als Gasgemisch hat, als wenn der Wärmeaustausch im Einzelnen ohne diese Einflüsse stattfände und einzelne Teilchen viel effizienter aufsteigen könnten, da sie auch mit viel mehr Wärmeenergie aufgeladen wären, also viel mehr Auftrieb besitzen, als ohne Mobilfunkstrahlung (oder den anderen Einfluß in urbanen Ballungsräumen mit vielen Menschen).<br />Elektromagnetische Felder zwingen Gase bis zu einem bestimmten Grad dazu, eine Einheit zu bilden, in der einzelne Atome/Moleküle weniger Freiheiten besitzen, als ohne diese Felder und Potentiale, die Anziehungskräfte zwischen den atomen/Molekülen erhöht ausfällt, was zu stabilerer Schichten-/Blasenbildung führt. Oder einfach die Bewegung der Atome innerhalb dieser Blase idealerweise wegen des Auftriebs nach oben leider umlenken und so die Tendenz der warmen Partikel nach Oben zu steigen, unterminiert, da deren Auftriebswirkung durch die Feldwirkung und Impulse durch die Feldschwingung auf die Partikel in der Atmosphäre wirken und die Partikel von ihrer Auftriebstendenz ablenken.<br /><br />Das elektrische Moment in der Szenerie kann man auch anhand von riesigen Nebeln im Weltraum wiederfinden: diese halten nur zusammen, weil sie als größere Einheit durch Ladungspotentiale aneinander gebunden sind und die einzelnen Teilchen in solchen Nebeln eben nicht einfach in irgendwelche Richtungen driften können. Zudem ist der Kollabs eines Nebels zu einer Sonne dem selben Effekt geschuldet: eine plötzliche Erhöhung/Veränderung im in dem Nebel befindlichen Ladungspotential, das die Partikel im Nebel dazu zwingt, schlagartig (was relativ ist) sich gegenseitig anzuziehen. Im Zweifel reicht da nur eine hinreichende Gravitationsquelle, die in den Nebel hineinfliegt, und dieses Ladungspotential und die stabile Form des Nebels damit stört, woraufhin sich plötzlich alle Partikel um so mehr anziehen. Gravitation wäre hier schlicht ein Unterschied im Ladungspotential zwischen den sich anziehenden Massen. Und das ist auch ziemlich plausibel berechenbar, wenn man von großen Gravitationsquellen als Protonen-Klumpen ausgeht, die eben Elektronen (oder negatives Potential) anziehen (welche hingegen aber nur als beestimmte Menge auf bestimmtem Volumen angereichert werden können, woraufhin es dann zu den Formen im Universum überhaupt erst kommen kann: Planeten, Sonnen.... Materie als Atome und Moleküle überhaupt).<br /><br />Das Moment der Massenträgheit und der Szenerie, das Impulsrichtungsveränderung und Kräfte durch elektromagnetische Strahlung bei bestimmter Frequenz zu einem gewissen Grad/Effekt mitbestimmt werden, sodass sich keine effiziente Auftriebswirkung durch Wärmeenergie ergibt, wäre die andere Einflußszenerie.<br /><br />Bei all dem muß beachtet werden, das die elektromagnetische Strahlung selbst keine/kaum (hinreichende) Wärmeenergie in die Atmosphäre einträgt, sondern nur atomar und molekular günstige Bedingungen erschafft, das Wärmeenergie sich eben so verhält, wie ich es andeute, und die zu einer &quot;Klimaerwärmung&quot; führt, weil sich die entropischen Tendenzen zu schnell vollziehen, die allerdings auschliesslich in der unteren Atmosphärenschicht stattfindet (was ein weiteres Indiz dafür ist, das die Ursache nicht allein nur auf ein Klimagas zurück zu führen ist, das eigendlich aufgrund seiner getragenen Wärmeerngie eine erhöhte Auftriebskraft enthalten / aufweisen sollte), sondern sich durch den erhöhten thermische ausgleichsprozesses und der elektrischen Bedingungen als Blase/Schicht stabilisiert. <br /><br />Insofern könnte man diese Klimaerwärmung/die Wärmeverteilung ebensogut auch mit den Mitteln der Mathematik der fluiden Eigenschaften berechnet werden, wenn man nur die dazu hinreichenden Faktoren einbezieht. Hier eben auch die Elektrostatischen Einflüsse und die gestörte Massenträgheit und Auftriebskraft der Wärmeenergie tragenden Teilchen.

Ugx2t3GwemKzs6fiZSV4AaABAg.9ClMq6AobJ_9ClMr7bUVgF		0	2020-08-25 01:57:51	cgfreeandeasy	Und es gibt ja verwegene Esotheriker, die da erklären, das eine natürliche Klimaerwärmung auch dadurch zustande kommen kann, weil die Fauna in den Biotopen diese elektromagnetischen Felder erzeugen, die da gewisse Einflüsse auf die Wetter- und Klimalage haben. Etwa, indem sie durch konstitutive Veränderungen des Nervensystems der ganzen Population dazu beitragen, das etwa die Kondensation von Wasserdampf verringert/verhindert wird (wozu nur ein sehr geringer Manipulationswert auf Quantenebene notwendig ist, um bei gegebener Umgebungsbedingung ungünstigerweise erhebliche Auswirkungen zu bewirken) allein, weil die Fauna ein neurologisches Signal/Potential in die Atmosphäre einträgt, das nicht mehr dazu hinreicht, das Wasserdampf in der Atmosphäre kondensiert - abseits der sonst üblichen und notwendigen Bedingungen, die ebenso immer recht geringe Grade der Veränderungen einzelner Bedingungen/Faktoren benötigt, um den Phasenübergang zu ermöglichen. Eine der extremsten Aussagen dazu ist diese: Eine Klimaerwärmung findet statt, wenn ein Massensterben genau diesen im Zusammenspiel mit der Natur und der Umwelt evolvierten neuronalen Komplex der dominanten Art verschwinden lässt und der neue dominante Teil der Fauna dann erst (evolutionär) "lernen" muß, wie das System funktioniert (was es eben nicht kognitiv macht, sondern unbewusst und ein evolutionärer Lerneffekt sei). Diese überdeutlichen Massensterben auf der Erde haben demnach nicht stattgefunden, weil sich das Klima drastisch verändert hat, sondern die drastische Klimaveränderung fand statt, weil es ein Massensterben gab. Das System "Gaia" ist zwar von der reduktionistischen Wissenschaft vernachlsässigt, aber es ist eben mutmaßlich doch viel einflußreicher, als man denkt, wenn man dem Reduktionismus so präferiert. Wenn man die künstliche Mobilfunk-Infratruktur und Strahlung mit dem neuronalen System und seine Auswirkungen also gleich stellt, dann ergäbe sich ein Effekt, der die natürlichen Bedingungen durch kpünstliche Einflüsse unterminiert. Man kann daraus Indizien für eine politisch gewollte Manipulation deuten, da ja Mobilfunk als elektromagnetische Strahlung mit Sicherheit auch Einfluß auf die Funktionen des Nervensystems haben (durch Reizung über den Proxi des elektrischen Feldes aus dem Gehirn selbst, über den hochfrequente Störungen übertragen werden können, die das Gehirn reizen und seine Funktion beeinflussen). Und also auch auf unser Bewusstsein Einfluß ausüben. In meinem Szenario aber wäre der eigendlich auslösende Prozess kein Massensterben (welches allerdings ja auch stattfinden soll), sondern die Störstrahlung aus den künstlichen Quellen der modernen Zivilisation. Und der Grund dieser offenbar sehr hohenb (zu hohen) Störstrahlung ist ein politischer Grund - nämlich: Die Verhaltensmanipulation von Menschen in extremen Umgebungsbedingungen. Kurz auch "Unterdrückung" genannt. Auf subtilste Art und vollkommen verleugnet.

Clean energy is mostly bullshit -- technologies like solar are only made possible by oil -- mineral extraction, smelting of aluminum and copper, massive amounts of energy are necessary to create batteries which last for only 5-10 years. The EROI is very low for solar. We are living in a time of abundant free energy -- burning millions of years worth of plants -- and that will soon come to and end and we will no longer be driving cars, flying in jets, etc, etc. What we have built will crumble quickly and most humans will be forced to live without air conditioning / heating. And since the population is rising, these energy problems become even harder to solve. In short, our love of technology is what will kill us. The fact that you and I are talking on our fancy new computers, connected by thousands of miles of wiring and god knows how many servers running in air-conditioned Amazon warehouses.

Shame on you for either being extremely gullible or totally dishonest. The MWP was a regional event. It was not global. This is now common knowledge. Most things on Earth were completely different when CO2 levels were higher so the impact was different. But it was hotter and sea level was much higher and climatic changes happened over thousands of years. Humans, civilization and agriculture evolved into the current inter-glacial period and this industrial warming is ten times faster than the post glaciation warming. Most species can't adapt that fast.	UCsZDCjnkMTO-jEO9PJaa6tQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsZDCjnkMTO-jEO9PJaa6tQ	1	UgzEVFoTdTRUGjutkGh4AaABAg	spex357

And it isn&#39;t sea level rise, which will take a hundred years (barring an Antarctic or Greenland ice collapse). It is famine. A few degrees rise globally pumps an enormous amount of energy into the weather system, which is a chaotic system. When you add energy to a chaotic system you get more Extremes and faster oscillations between extremes. These wildly swinging extremes will destroy crops, which rely on some weather consistency. Crop destruction leads to famine. And historically, famine leads to war. In fact, the Syrian civil war started with food shortages due to crop disasters.

I don&#39;t know why climate change deniers are using this video to substantiate their denial. Climate change is a fact. It poses a threat to humanity is also a fact as mentioned by Dr. Palmer himself. Dr. Palmer is not claiming here climate change is untrue or the model is untrue or disingenuous. All models will have limitations. Simulating temperature increase with great precision due to climate change is easy but to account for weather extremes and finding a tipping point due to nonlinear trend is difficult. <br />This is nowhere close to the discussion in the comment section. <br /> Scientists argue with each other all the time to improve the models. There is immense pressure on climate scientists to model and project the weather extremes. People should watch what he says at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fkCo_trbT8&amp;t=27m30s">27:30</a> and not let their political leaders think for them.

I am getting tired of these non-rebuttals where you use buzz-words like "logical", "facts", and "arguments" without even saying anything. What you have said has nothing to do with the greenhouse effect? Not a single statement you made has anything to do with science. The greenhouse effect is caused by gases in the atmosphere made up of heteronuclear molecules, not liquids. I am done wasting my time.

The green house effect is only a description of the interaction between gasses, liquids and radiation. Its fundamentally our atmosphere made of a cocktail of gases that allows life, not the level of C02 or water vapor in isolation. I understand and dont necessarily disagree with you, but your wording and presentation of facts within an arguments need work. Climate change is inevitable, just ask the dinosaurs. If we want to win an arguments, then our arguments need to be on point and not sloppy. We have to also acknowledge the counter factuals that without fossil fuels, we would have never had an opportunity to understand the complexity of nature and escape it as we can inside our homes. Too hot? Turn on the aircon, too cold? Turn on your heater, that is saving more lives than anything every single year.

These are heteronuclear molecules that takes infrared radiation and absorbed it to undergo vibrational excitation. I study these things for living. Since you didn't learn what I learnt in middle school. Here is the nasa educational website for kids explaining the same thing. "Without any greenhouse gases, Earth would be an icy wasteland. Greenhouse gases keep our planet livable by holding onto some of Earth's heat energy so that it doesn't all escape into space." https://climatekids.nasa.gov/greenhouse-effect-and-carbon-cycle/#:~:text=Without%20any%20greenhouse%20gases%2C%20Earth,t%20all%20escape%20into%20space.&text=Just%20as%20too%20little%20greenhouse,gas%20makes%20Earth%20too%20warm. Here is another source just so you make NASA a part of your conspiracy. "The Earth’s surface, warmed by the Sun, radiates heat into the atmosphere. Some heat is absorbed by greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and then radiated to space (A). Some heat makes its way to space directly (B). Some heat is absorbed by greenhouse gases and then radiated back towards the Earth’s surface (C). With more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere later this Century, more heat will be stopped by greenhouse gases, warming the planet.

I have all the proof for my fact, do you have it for yours? 'We don't freeze because of the green house' what are you talking about? We exist on this planet thanks to atmosphere and ozone. Greenhouse is an effect of the sun radiation and the atmosphere working in unison to reject some and conserve some of that radiation that enters. I am not arguing against a dim future due to fossil fuel use, I'm arguing rather with your lack of skill to set out a logical argument. If you want to belittle and debate 'deniers' then get your arguments straight first.

Green house effect is the reason life is possible on earth and not in mars because it prevents the planet from freezing in the absence of sunlight, which is half the day. The excess of greenhouse effect causes excess warming of the globe causing climate change. The same concepts that make infrared cameras and microwaves work also explains green house effect and climate change. Its called moecular spectroscopy. So, do they not exist where you live? We are all humans living in one planet. It is in our interest to keep this planet habitable. At least, read a little bit and understand the problem before making up your mind about it.

Six official investigations have cleared scientists of accusations of wrongdoing. A three-part Penn State University cleared scientist Michael Mann of wrongdoing. Two reviews commissioned by the University of East Anglia"supported the honesty and integrity of scientists in the Climatic Research Unit." A UK Parliament report concluded that the emails have no bearing on our understanding of climate science and that claims against UEA scientists are misleading. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Inspector General's office concluded there was no evidence of wrongdoing on behalf of their employees. The National Science Foundation's Inspector General's office concluded, "Lacking any direct evidence of research misconduct...we are closing this investigation with no further action." Other agencies and media outlets have investigated the substance of the emails. The Environmental Protection Agency, in response to petitions against action to curb heat-trapping emissions, dismissed attacks on the science rooted in the stolen emails. Factcheck.org debunked claims that the emails put the conclusions of climate science into question. Politifact.com rated claims that the emails falsify climate science as "false." An Associated Press review of the emails found that they "don't undercut the vast body of evidence showing the world is warming because of man-made greenhouse gas emissions."

"Unfortunately, the book is deeply and fatally flawed. At the simplest level, it is a polemic based on a strawman argument: To Shellenberger, scientists, “educated elite,” “activist journalists,” and high-profile environmental activists believe incorrectly that the end of the world is coming and yet refuse to support the only solutions that he thinks will work – nuclear energy and uninhibited economic growth. ‘What is new in here isn’t right, and what is right isn’t new.’ But even if the author properly understood the complexity and nature of global challenges, which he does not, and got the science right, which he did not, a fatal flaw in his argument is the traditional Cornucopian oversimplification of his solutions – reliance on economic growth and silver-bullet technology."

The model was not a " model" in any sense, it merely an algorithm that turned predicted and mock exam results into a final score. They didn't actually "model" the population of students. Besides, it has since emerged that the exam boards, who give the final grades warned the UK government that the results were going to be unfair and cause great dissatisfaction, but political pressure was applied and chaos ensued. The UK A-level exams were a government cock up. As for covid 19, the models were largely very accurate. In the UK, the imperial model was used to wake the government up to the looming crisis which they reacted to, although they were two weeks late. _Then add to the mix NASA falsifying data_ What data did they falsify? Is it that the earth is really flat, but they made it look round?	UCUeRLK_XJNl0EpSZFjuUU4w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUeRLK_XJNl0EpSZFjuUU4w	1	UgyO9JPYzKTt3GR9uDZ4AaABAg	Marc lang

Simply put, a reasonably thoughtful and informed person who reads the Article is unlikely to place any stock in Dr. Ball’s views, including his views of Dr. Weaver as a supporter of conventional climate science.” "...with the strangest get-out-of-jail-free card ever delivered in a Canadian libel trial, the judge concluded that Ball’s writing was too apparently idiotic to be taken seriously."

So why the delay? Obviously because their case was weak. Essentially, they lost. Next time perhaps don't use a source that in turn uses Mann's twitter feed as its source. That just foolish, the bias is obvious. Also, Mann uses data based on tree rings, there are plenty of similar studies from the same time that did the exact same thing, but different trees and they got extremely different result. This suggests that it is not a reliable method. Not only that, Mann switches between data from tree rings and temperature measurements etc. in a way that it would produce those exact result, turned on it's head and switched for the opposite, the outcome would have been completely different. Why Mann used the data the way he did is still not explained, it needs explanation. Likewise the discrepancies between his and the work of other people, which shows no warming at all.

When it's closer, Earth begins to warm which increases heat and releases CO2. This forms a feedback loop where CO2 increase heat and heat releases CO2. When Earth moves farther, the process reverses. Industrial CO2 is causing Earth to warm at an extreme rate even though we should be in a natural cooling trend.

Generally speaking though, you’re completely misapprehending how the scientific process works. Science isn’t like writing code or doing long division where you make one mistake and everything else comes out wrong. That’s actually a fallacy on your behalf - you’re treating the scientific process like a philosophical argument and then wondering why 2+2 doesn’t equal the sky being blue. It just doesn’t work like that. Datasets in science stand on their own merit, and a theory, a model of those datasets, isn’t going to be wrong just because the first dataset was faulty, because that dataset would have been repeated and modified many times over. You need to provide a source and elaborate a bit more but your general proposition that the greenhouse gas theory is somehow wrong because it is based on a faulty premise is completely false, because it wasn’t built on a single premise, it was built on many different concepts from different fields — physics, geology, meteorology — and they all stand alone each on their own merit, before being tied together.

There is a consensus among scientists on the basic scientific fact that greenhouse gases cause global warming, therefore the science is settled.

Because it’s the exact same scientific process; elimination studies, correlations, inference, cross-referencing other disciplines.

Something to consider. By the way, that’s not how fallacies work. A fallacy would be if the premise leads to a faulty conclusion. YOU just disagree with the premise.

This is it, Why did temperature rise around the globe BEFORE co2 and greenhouse gases increase? And why are the temperatures decreasing now? The climate changes have been happening since this planet first had an atmosphere. The climate will continue to change due mostly to solar maximums and solar minimums and currently the heat waves in Canada are due to the Magnetic north pole migrating out of northern Canada towards Siberia affecting the tilt of the earth in relation to the sun. The north pole has been moving approximately 50Km per year since the 1990&#39;s and has crossed the arctic ocean. The Climate change industry rakes in hundreds of billions of $ preaching the hoax and scaring people around the world.

Do the extra 5.8 people not breathe out CO2? Does the growth of meat agriculture to support that population not produce CO2 through respiration and waste gases? Any honest person hast to see the issue is population growth, not advances in technology.

If we were talking about climate change on Venus, for example, we can be much more agnostic in the interpretation of data. If the models say 50% chance of massive climate change, and 50% chance of only moderate change, we can say that the science is far from settled and we need to do more research before we can reliably say what&#39;s going to happen on Venus. With climate change on Earth though, we&#39;re forced to make decisions on incomplete information. Most of us will change our diet if our doctor projects a 50% chance of heart attack in the next 10 years, even if there&#39;s a lot of uncertainty in medical forecasts. But for many people, the climate models aren&#39;t accurate enough to make societal changes, even though they&#39;re all in agreement that things will get worse and it could be catastrophic.

The number is treated as accurate and precise once it is quoted in this manner.<br /><br />I have no doubt climate change is real, as does Sabine and Prof Palmer, but scientists need to do more to ensure that the public understands these models are useful but have limitations. The fact that you can even make a guess at future climate states of such a complex system is an astounding achievement in itself.

Not many people can wrap there head around simple statistical information or chaos theory and they project in a linear fashion but the climate will react chaotically.Small increases of energy have high peak effects prediction is not possible, projection of trends is as good as we get .

Stop driving the problem and the models don’t matter. <br />The Macro models are good enough to show the scope of the problem, stop making the problem worse and the micro models aren’t required.

He makes the statement that the &quot;natural variability of climate is at a minimum at global scales&quot; which strikes me as comical. The earth has been in and out of 4 separate glacial periods over the last 400k years where temperatures change by as much as 18F... and all during periods of relative constant levels of CO2. Glacier National Park in the US is estimated to have began forming around 7000 years ago, during a period when CO2 levels were 35% lower than today... in other words it was warmer 7000 years ago when there was no fossil fuel industrialization, no cars, ~10 million people and no human GHG emissions... warmer than today when there are 6.5 billion people, 1 billion cars and CO2 levels 35% higher. Clearly the &quot;natural variability of climate and atmosphere&quot; (the part science does not understand) is not at a minimum at global scales. Just another junk science video.

For some time I have a question, that are almost never talked about: It is not only the greenhouse gases, but how they get there. The way we produce and use energy results in us dumping insane amounts of heat energy directly to the environment, and AT THE SAME TIME we release a huge amunt of gases, that hinders it&#39;s dissipation to space. I do not see any kind of discussion about that. Perhaps someone have some answers to this.	UCWtihObRBNJvLElHfUpHbfQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWtihObRBNJvLElHfUpHbfQ	0

However we also dump a lot of energy directly into the environment with all the transportation, industrial production, agriculture etc. These consists a huge portion of our total energy usage, and my problem is that I don't see the figures discussed publicly that much. Yes, it is small fraction of the solar irradiation, but can complement other effects.

During WWII its economic growth was built on the production and export of arms and the reduction of domestic consumption. The end of the war meant a collapse of those exports. No one else had USDs to buy US goods so America had to grant them. <br />This wasn’t a long term solution and neither was the technological advancement driven by the Cold War economy. Capitalism had failed but the extension of the more productive techniques of the US to the rest of the world temporarily stabilised the problem. <br /><br />We are now in another breakdown and the major capitalist powers see no way out but to prepare for war again.

None of those things are going away with electric cars. Oh yea, those 7.7 billion people all need electricity. Here’s another contributor, Wildfire. It has been estimated that a single large wildfire in California produced more CO2 emissions that all of the cars in California for a year. Yet, I don’t see any effort by Climate Activists to address our pathetic firefighting capabilities. There is only one large aircraft for fire suppression in the entire state of California. There should be 50. Same with the other states and around the world. Not only do fires produce massive amounts of CO2 , they destroy millions of trees. Cars are a very minor contributor, yet almost all of the focus.	UCZAHuYZ7so65IacLjoEKSpg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZAHuYZ7so65IacLjoEKSpg	0

As far as I know, no one can yet quantify the size of the greenhouse effect caused by CO2. So far, there are only model calculations, but no controlled laboratory experiments.<br />For 50 years, climate research has failed to design and conduct laboratory experiments that could confirm or falsify the greenhouse gas hypothesis.<br />For this reason, I consider climate research to be pseudo-science because of the untested greenhouse gas theory.<br />On the other hand, I still believe that global warming is taking place and is mainly man-made, although CO2 probably plays a very small role in this. Much greater seem to be effects such as the sealing of land areas by general urbanization, deforestation, air traffic, which produces cirrus clouds, which reduces heat radiation from the ground into space.<br />I am afraid that we care too much about reducing CO2 emissions as these other possible causes of global warming.<br /><br />Translated with <a href="http://www.deepl.com/Translator">www.DeepL.com/Translator</a> (free version)	UCYj8vK8XNEscYPFggejwnoQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYj8vK8XNEscYPFggejwnoQ	0

Part of the answer is we've (the developed world) had 200+ years of pouring green house gasses into the atmosphere, while the developing world is only ramping up now - at best over the past 20 years, and in may cases less than 20 years. Whilst they may be contributing substantially to the instantaneous emissions now, in the sum total of all man made emissions they have contributed only a very small part. The professor may have other reasons too, for making this claim.	UC8ff5aQGcdbRqOHtqEMGpAQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8ff5aQGcdbRqOHtqEMGpAQ	1	Ugx-TTuYTy6B97EMz9J4AaABAg	Jotto999

Why not help nature remove CO2 from the air by seeding our oceans with Fe02 ? This will help plankton bloom and ingest CO2 and produce O2. Are there any concerns with this sort of solution?

UgxQ9AngXUmoy2tPUxN4AaABAg	1	1	2020-07-22 01:48:36	John McLean	This guy is correct on some points but woeful on others. He seems to think that climate models are accurate when the IPCC&#39;s 2013 report said that 111 of 114 climate model runs predicted greater warming for the period 1998-2012 than actually occurred. Further, a consensus of models is meaningless because if there were any accurate models, their output is merged with the output of many inaccurate climate models. He also talks of some organizations running models multiple times. Doesn&#39;t he know that each run will be slightly different.<br />Finally, when two leading physicists, Happer and van Wijngaarden, use the mathematics of quantum physics to investigate top of atmosphere radiation at different wavelengths and show that if CO2 doubled (take 150 years or more) temperatures will probably rise between 1 and 1.5C, doesn&#39;t it show that Palmer&#39;s alarmism is misguided?

Qualitative analysis shows water vapor covers most of the CO2 widest peak and that water vapor dominates the spectrum over all others. Quantitative analysis would show, based upon widely fluctuating presence of water vapor, that is it hundreds- to-thousands times more present than CO2. Is this in the models?

No matter how many models are run, the truth is, that at a point in the not so distant future, earth may become mostly uninhabitable! 😉 Will he talk differently, when the forest near his house has burned down 3 times in 5 years?<br />The general consensus is, that earth is getting warmer! I can attest to the climate change, having lived in the same local for over 70 years! The weather in northern Europe has changed considerably.<br />If you heat a surface or space in one corner, eventually the whole has the same temperature. So the local weather becomes irrelevant after a period of time.	UC07lxt3BqmF3tPlLGWMFhSQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC07lxt3BqmF3tPlLGWMFhSQ	0

But in time as with Covid-19, we will be learning far more and in doing so, be in a far superior and knowledgeable position to forecast more accurate weather-case model scenarios and possible outcomes, whichever they eventually maybe, pending location and varying circumstances of course. <br /> <br />So Sabine, as a keen layperson and follower, I must thank you and your colleague Prof Tim Palmer aka part-time lead guitarist in your entertaining and sometimes informative music videos, for a clear and honest assessment of the current position of climate change models with regards to &#39;global&#39; temperature forecasts, of which as Tim pointed out, have been surprisingly accurate for a substantial period of time, and from this layperson&#39;s point of view, this seems fundamentally the most important issue, as climate change indeed is no hoax but alas it will take time for more detailed &#39;regional&#39; models from across the World to have greater accuracy, given the many variables at place...... cheers Richard from OZ.

Come back when y&#39;all have an equally compelling theory of why our planet is suddenly getting warmer. Not that it&#39;s really a theory, the composition of the atmosphere having an impact on climate is simple fact (anyone who disagrees is welcome to move to a planet without an ozone layer), the only thing that could be up for question is by how much. Now that&#39;s not saying there are not OTHER factors. But none of those other factors have changed recently or change rapidly for that matter.

Since the variability between the different models is greater than the predicted rise in global mean temperature then its absurd for politicians to claim that they can accuracy predict doom, gloom, death and destruction.

This is because the effect is saturated with respect to carbon dioxide level. A doubling of carbon dioxide level will not lead to a doubling of greenhouse effect due to carbon dioxide. It will lead I believe to a 20% increase. This is a 20% precent increase of the fraction of the green house effect due to carbon dioxide. Since this fraction may be as low as 10 percent and as high as 30 percent. We are talking about between a 2 percent and 6 percent increase in the of the overall greenhouse effect. So I would not hold my breath expecting a 3 degree celcus temperature rise in the mean planetary temperature. My guess is that we would be lucky to see a 1 degree celcus temperature rise due to doubling of carbon dioxide levels say to 800 ppm. This fixation on carbon dioxide levels is why there has not be a significant progress in climate science and climate modelling in the last twenty years	UCM1Dgfoe1gK0D-JcBftiFUg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCM1Dgfoe1gK0D-JcBftiFUg	1	UgxiSXZTftTvmYaKZjh4AaABAg	Donald Boughton

What climate scientists claim is that humans change the balance of climate by injecting additional greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide. It's like "1=1", but then we added 0.01 on the left hand side and nothing on the right hand side, so now the equilibrium is disturbed, even though our contribution is somewhat small.

That's why this graph appears as it does. http://www.biocab.org/Geological_Timescale.jpg We know that correlation does not prove causation, but we also know that lack of correlation disproves causation. Empirical data from weather balloons do not support the claim that there is a "greenhouse effect". Computer modelling is used in engineering to great effect. Computer models in climate modelling may one day be as good as the models used to determine the load on a structure, but thus far weather is too complex and not well enough understood to provide accurate results.

It took me less than 4 Min listening to the first link y give to me to realize that the first myth comes up by this guy tell his audience the climate in the last 10.000 years has been relatively stable. Well. As we all know this is completely wrong. In this time of the last 10.000 years big changes have taken place on planet earth. For example people lived in the region what we call today the sahara about 6-7thousand years ago. Out of my sight, this is a much larger change in climate as the 0,9 C of warming we maesured today since the last 150 years or so. And by the way. Is it was so, that latent heat cause the warming in waves, how y explain that? As i understand it, the Oceane would take up heat and then there would be a delayed warming. But after that the temperature would have to rise permanently. But there were several waves. At first it got warmer, then colder, then warmer, then colder, then warmer again and then it stagnated for 20 years until the El Ninjo again reached a record temperature of 14.8C in 2016. Since then it has been colder than 14.8C. So in my opinion Heat absorption by the oceans does not explain the measurements.

And what do we glean from a juxtaposition of models with measured temps for the time AFTER 1990? Huge discrepancies between foretold temp trends and actual mean temps!

Every time they do more research, they discover that the situation is WORSE than they predicted it would be a few years ago and we have even less time to stop using carbon emitting fossil fuels and switch over 100% to non carbon emitting forms of power. The world, as a whole including the US, STILL hasn&#39;t gotten the message yet and the capitalists are trying to minimize the situation in the hope that they are right about it not being real so they can go right on polluting our biosphere as much as they want to and as long as they want as they continue raking in their huge incomes. When they realize how wrong they were, you&#39;ll see them all quietly moving down to Antarctica to enjoy the cooler weather down there and living off of the wealth they looted from the rest of humanity! The rest of us will be left up here to deal with the flooded out coastal cities, killer summer temperatures, environmental damage, and any disease pandemics created by the higher than normal temperatures.

To the merits of your case I want to point out that although the western nations are in for an ominous degradation, we have to understand that it is a protracted one, for several reasons. Amongst others, there is the race to the bottom with regard to currencies, counterbalanced somewhat by huge gains of efficiency thanks to technological and scientific advances. As the outsourcing makes products cheaper, prohibitive pricing strangles consumers only in the services and not in the trade section. This explains why inflation doesn’t bite so much overall (up to now), but prosperity is nevertheless under assault because of services like repair, assistance or (the production oriented) house building. Furthermore one has to take into account that even though corporations are keen to prevent a tax base in countries with high taxation, billionaires with some form of residence in the US are still taxed for their personal income, be it derived from board activities or via capital gains. Likewise, all share owners are taxed for profits from foreign value added. This helps to mitigate the wows of public finances. Finally, I want to compliment you for agreeing that a strong industrial base is the only source of (material) prosperity, all our other differences aside. All this talk about a “services society” glosses over the fact that, for example, the comfort provided by a physician doesn’t create national wealth by itself, but necessitates that others are satisfying the demand for material goods so that the doctor is free to provide its service.

My concern is who is going to give Americans "foreigh aid" when WE are finally going down the drain from all of the debt we're racking up?! Answer: NO ONE! We'll be on our own and our incompetent politicians then will be desperately trying to paper it over with fiat currency to make it look like it's all gone away. But the rest of the world won't be interested in worthless US dollars no matter how colorfully printed up they may be or how much hot air BS they are "backed up" with. They will be looking for GOLD bullion bars and it won't take long before Fort Knox's vaults are emptied out. Imo, one of the US' priorities now, aside from switching over to democratic socialism, it to start reducing this debt. The US used to be the world's leading creditor nation. Now we are the world's leading debtor nation! Economies that are thriving are not constantly increasing their debt, they are decreasing it. Sooner or later, probably much sooner than anyone expects, the US debt "bubble" is going to explode and when it does average Americans will experience a decline in their standard of living that they would expect to see in an impoverished Third World country. Everyone will be wondering why it was allowed to get to that point. Reason? Right now the rich are making too much money off of the status quo and are in no rush to change anything. They have a live for the moment and grab all the wealth you can and let tomorrow take care of itself philosophy. WHEN tomorrow finally comes and the mess they created didn't take care of itself, they will be living comfortably with their loot and as far away from the desperate masses as they can get!

Technically, it’s what I have hinted at with my mentioning of the “glorification of free trade at all costs”. Bottom line is that to me, the outsourcing of labour to national economies which have much lesser labour costs, much lower costs of living, much lower property and facility development costs *is unfair* (regardless of the absence or presence of ecological regulations). One has to be aware, though, that this kind of policy is a very efficient foreign aid und has boosted developing economies throughout the world, as can be seen via global energy consumption statistics (much more people do have finally laundry machines, air conditioning, heated water and so on). I personally draw the line where substantial sacrifice is forced upon western nations, and especially when some classes are much more harmed than others.

There's nothing wrong with free trade as long as it is fair trade and the modern world could not exist without it. What happened to the US industrial sector was certainly not fair trade. On average we were buying $5 worth of manufactured goods from China while they were buying $1 of resource materials from us to make those goods. That created a chronic yearly trade imbalance that persists to the present and which the rich in this country considered to be "free trade" and made sure they got their puppets in the US Congress to protect with various trade policies. The result was the closing of about 20% of the manufacturing plants in the US and the loss of tens of millions of good paying, middle class lifestyle supporting jobs. As that happened whole towns, often dependent upon a single company to supply most of everyone's incomes, became poverty stricken. Crime and drug dealing / use escalated. Only democratic socialism can help to relieve these problems caused by all the free, but really unfair trade policies that the rich have been pushing on everyone since the Nixon days. Right now the US National Debt is nearing $30 trillion with no end in sight. It will continue to get worse while the politicians keep babbling about how giving the rich even bigger tax breaks will solve the problem. Lol! That nonsense is a PROVEN failure, but it's still be peddled as their "solution". The first time the US can't meet the interest payments on all that debt, the Treasury Bond market will crash and the US won't be able to borrow, in the name of its citizens, all of the money needed to keep our technological Disneyland running along. That's when you'll see the real terror set in as our standard of living here drops to what's seen in many of the poorest Third World nations. Imagine what would happen the week after the first time that the Social Security checks did not get mailed out or direct deposited! Can't happen? Lol! It's all a LOT closer than anybody realizes now.

Actually, they "strive" to charge as many consumers as much as possible while keeping their own costs, especially for labor, as low as possible. The current collapse of the American industry sector is due to the rich "out sourcing" as many of our jobs to the Asian slave labor markets as possible and then bringing back the goods and selling them here cheaper than they can be made by American labor. That then creates a vicious cycle where, to keep making the maximum profit, all of the remaining companies in the US have to shift production overseas. This nonsense started during the Nixon administration and continues up to today. American labor was caught off guard and now their unions have next to no bargaining power as a result. It all worked out just fine and dandy for the rich. Meanwhile, Americans are in debt up to their eyeballs and being told that "conservative" politicians will straighten it all out for them. Lol! THEY are the ones who started it and NOW profit from it. They will milk this cow until it's completely dry and then, unless the US switches over completely to democratic socialism, all hell is going to break lose here. The bond and stock markets will crash and the US dollar will be about as valuable as a Zimbabwe one billion dollar bill! The sooner Americans wake up to what's happening to them, the sooner they will rise up, START voting en masse, and put an end to it all.

In fact, it has been proven many times in the course of history that almost all people profit from an economic order in which the recipients of trades and services decide by their own free will who gets how much money. If you don’t want rich APPLE investors, than don’t buy an APPLE, period. Moreover, neediness and the relative scarcity of wealth are two different kettles of fish. I’ve already pointed above to the fact that the billionaires’ wealth is not founded on their wish to have as much golden wc-bowls as possible, but on their strive to satisfy as many consumers as possible. That’s what benefits the whole of society. Only feudal Saudi Clans seem to cherish golden wc-bowls, besides. Ordinary citizens like me see the GREED of those who live on involuntary contributions and their dogma of purportedly necessary redistributions through “public” pockets (minus “provisions”) as the main obstacle to their own pursuit of happiness. I know for sure: if I should fail economically it will be because of the politicians and their cronies, not because people are allowed to own billions. And as regards the tribulations caused by globalization, that is, again, the responsibility of the political class.

The rich always say they have good intentions, but, ultimately, their main concern is the OWN wealth and any benefits they let trickle down to the masses are only the ones they think will enrich them further. With the coming democratic socialist world order, captialism will not be completely eliminated. There will still be SOME variations in income based on how much effort one makes to be trained for a job and how much work his or her job entails. That is only fair. However, there will have to be an upper limit on how much income any one person can get and how much wealth he or his family can accumulate over time. A universal taxation system should take care of that nicely. All of the taxes collected will then be used to fund various social programs for everyone, richer and poorer alike. This system could be put into effect right now, but it is still being successfully blocked by the rich who make sure they buy the votes of politicians to enact legislation that will maintain the present status quo. But, people, like me and billions of others, have finally awoken to what the real problem with this world is...GREED by a 1% minority who are delusional enough to think it is their divine right to possess 50% or more of the Earth's wealth while the other 99% majority have to struggle to get by on the remaining 50%. Things can and will be changing drastically in the future and the first sign of it in the US will be the upcoming Biden victory followed by the Democrats taking over the Senate.

However, - Free university tuition is the exploitation of people who don’t have diplomas, but have to contribute with their work and property to resources consumed by the academic community. - As academic employment is a very interesting and therefore attractive, but oftentimes unproductive pastime, a dwindling number of people without diplomas will be forced to contribute ever more for academic life, the more so as there will be a build-up of political pressure to create jobs for graduates in controlling, guidance and coaching disciplines, such as gender studies, psychology, climate science and the like. And not just for the sake of the livelihood of law graduates, ever more regulations will have to be created. Even now, the global amount of political pork flowing into climate science and associated industries surpasses the trillion Dollar threshold, as it seems. - The onslaught to academic life can’t be modulated alone by paying graduates less and non-academic workers in the dirty or less interesting sectors more, because the social standing of being academic and as such not being bound to satisfy a concrete demand outweighs monetary consideration. Before closing this chapter and moving forward to other questions, I want to stress that I’ve full respect for the wealth of academics earned by the free exchange of goods and services, such as earnings from intellectual property by way of patents. Constitutional questions: Eliminating a second chamber amounts to the elimination of autonomous self-determination of smaller units. This can be compared with a one chamber world government, where every vote weighs just a ten-billionth. Social questions: A guaranteed minimum income amounts to the exploitation of those willing to engage in the free exchange of trades and services.

It allows for many different parties each with proposals for enhancing the lives and opportunities of a nation's citizens. But, they must all recognize that there will be certain fundamental entitlements that all citizens will be guaranteed and which can not be revoked by the government. These will include such things as "medicare for all", free education up through the PhD level for those that can maintain a minimum average grade, guaranteed minimum income, etc. Aside from these "basics", there will be much discussion and coalition building to achieve other "big" things for society. More importantly, it can help get rid of the current two party partisan politics that now spend most of its time in a kind of grid lock that rarely agrees on anything. There will be no two house legislature. We will have a simpler, one house parliamentary system with each political party trying to win as many of a limited number of seats and votes as possible. Streamlining the US federal government will help get things done much more quickly. It should take decades for the changes to take place that people need. It should take less than a year, at most.

But, they all seem to be pointing to a rising global temperature which will cause much change to our biosphere. Personally, I noticed that the last "winter" in my area, northeast USA, was the FIRST I've seen in my entire life where I did not see a single snowflake fall. Yes, it could have just been chance. But, now I'm noticing that it's getting usually warm for early July and I'm expecting it to be even warmer in the coming months. I think a lot of Americans will start to take Climate Change seriously THIS summer if we start to get random power outages throughout the nation and their air conditions shut down for a few hours or days forcing them to sit in their homes sweltering from the heat and humidity. That could be just what's needed to make everybody, globally, start demanding we seriously begin the shift away from fossil fuels. Meanwhile, the Chinese are ready to supply the planet with as many all electric cars as they want along with the solar panels to power them all. When all of the world's wealth starts flowing over to China to pay for it all everyone is going to VERY upset with the western capitalists that let the situation get this bad.

Next, is that the reported world wide temperatures (temperature reporting stations) - which data is used to calculate the mean temperature - are fatally compromised. A significant portion of the stations that have data going back generation used to be out in the near wilderness and are now surrounded by buildings, roads, power plants, and on and on. It is now comparing apples and oranges. <br /><br />I made two heavily insulated &quot;heat&quot; boxes with a glass panel on one side each. One was atmospheric air. The other had the CO2 level of the air increased to 800 ppm (to the best of my ability) by a judicious use of one of my bottles of compressed gas used on the farm for welding, cutting and heat treating. Set out in the sun all day side by side on a clear July day and hourly temperatures inside the boxes were recorded. There was no significant difference between the two. The minor differences were due to chance (Students T test) My quick and dirty test is an N of 1 - for whatever it might be worth.<br /><br />There are people out there pointing out the fallacies of the climate change true believers. Freeman Dyson for one, Tony Heller for another, and a number of others whose grants do not depend on virtue signalling. At this point I believe we are seeing weather, sun activity, orbital variation (and cycles) etc. and not anthropogenic climate change. Lastly, reducing emissions is good. No one can be against it. Claiming it will slow/change/stop climate change is delusional, however..	UCfGgVaPuIfMw3PSC0_FNVew	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfGgVaPuIfMw3PSC0_FNVew	0

Just because there is a correlation does not necessarily make it the cause. I though you knew that. CO2 is a very stable chemical. Even if we stop all CO2 production today it would be over 100 years before one on you “scientist” could say it is coming down very slowly. Methane is a much stronger greenhouse gas compared to CO2 but would take only 30 years before levels started to come down very quickly. There is a way to cool the planet very quickly: I will give you a hint: How do volcanoes cool the planet? We need an equation for ice melt: ice melt is exponential not linear and they wonder why their prediction are always low. One more hint: latent heat. <br /><a href="https://www.google.com/search?ei=JUftXt6dEd2v0PEPopGXkAg&amp;q=methane+releases+in+the+United+States&amp;oq=correlation+does+not+make+it+the+cause&amp;gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQElAAWABgrO8TaABwAHgAgAEAiAEAkgEAmAEAoAEGqgEHZ3dzLXdpeg&amp;gs_ivs=1&amp;sclient=psy-ab#tts=0">https://www.google.com/search?ei=JUftXt6dEd2v0PEPopGXkAg&amp;q=methane+releases+in+the+United+States&amp;oq=correlation+does+not+make+it+the+cause&amp;gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQElAAWABgrO8TaABwAHgAgAEAiAEAkgEAmAEAoAEGqgEHZ3dzLXdpeg&amp;gs_ivs=1&amp;sclient=psy-ab#tts=0</a> <a href="https://www.google.com/search?ei=a0jtXs-3O9K4-gSS2LUw&amp;q=methane+release+from+permafrost&amp;oq=methane+releases+in+the+United+States&amp;gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQElAAWABg8McCaABwAHgAgAEAiAEAkgEAmAEAoAEGqgEHZ3dzLXdpeg&amp;gs_ivs=1&amp;sclient=psy-ab#tts=0">https://www.google.com/search?ei=a0jtXs-3O9K4-gSS2LUw&amp;q=methane+release+from+permafrost&amp;oq=methane+releases+in+the+United+States&amp;gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQElAAWABg8McCaABwAHgAgAEAiAEAkgEAmAEAoAEGqgEHZ3dzLXdpeg&amp;gs_ivs=1&amp;sclient=psy-ab#tts=0</a> <a href="https://www.cowspiracy.com/">https://www.cowspiracy.com/</a>	UCPYLRYsZYi_a9srUPE6ZL3g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPYLRYsZYi_a9srUPE6ZL3g	0

Whether the catastrophes talked about here will remain localised, as is suggested, is of course a crucial issue. The science already demonstrated that it is not a risk worth taking. Better to be safe than sorry and bxllxcks to the bread heads who can’t listen to reason or learn to behave responsibly. It may already be too late. But the current so-called “COVID-19” crisis has resulted in a global drop in CO2 emissions of some 40%. This coupled with the huge investment in sustainable energy projects means the politicians are at least trying. Just for once it’s not their fault! They’ve been busy finding ways to reduce carbon emissions without the bread heads losing out a single penny. COVID will change all that, of course<br />Once again I remind everybody that if we’d set up a coherence group when Maharishi suggested it, we’d have sorted all this long ago. We can still do it:- there are thousands of retired people with time on their hands who are now very experienced sidhas. What’s to lose?

Did you know rules for radicals state to accuse your opponent of what you're doing? Lack of science on a website run by a guy that likes to dress as a natzi. It defines the political weapon this has been used for. My entire argument was not based on a single point but many (that's the 1st mistake you made). The same fool at sks claims the medieval warm period was a local event. The same fool deletes post from people that do not agree with his cult following. If you bothered to read any of the material on the link you would see a great deal of disagreement (for posts kept on there) The 1st graph used in your link is wrong - as I showed and cited the paper. (the 2nd mistake you made). The comments in the link also don't account for when Co2 and temperature where completely out of step. Also the paper they took the data from actually says "...we feel that it is premature to infer the sign of the phase relationship between CO2 and temperature at the start of terminations" This was noted in the Vostok data and ignored. The "feedback mechanism" is an invented one with no actual proof of the concept that is repeatable. It's an assumption never proven. Also the article debunks itself since as per the other geologic records co2 has been completely out of step from temperature with no correlation, let alone causation whatsoever. The 2nd graph is temperature with CO2 used as already proven bad proxy data I cited several papers showing CO" to be way different than the ice core record AND why the data is unreliable. You didn't read them. It's a propaganda site that ignores what does not fit within it's cult belief system. Let's test another BS claim from SKS. "That the Medieval warm period was a local event" (they pick and chose so of course don't like PROVEN climate cycles) Liu, Y., Cai, Q., Song, H., An, Z., & Linderholm, H. W. (2011).

"..."In the present study, only three or four of the sites are from Europe, so it cannot be argued that the MWP was strictly a European phenomenon. Other studies also show the MWP (Little Climatic Optimum) in Europe (Lamb, 1965; Martinez-Cortizas et al., 1999; Shindell et al., 2001), Greenland (Dahl-Jensen et al., 1998), Africa (deMenocal et al., 2000; Holmgren et al., 2001), North America (Campbell et al., 1998; Li et al., 2000; Petersen, 1994; Shabalova and Weber, 1999), South America (Iriondo et al., 1993; Villabala, 1994), and Asia (Hong et al., 2000; Liu et al., 1998)." So your website is wrong about that too. John Crook and Hansen are climate activists. You've not debunked anything. Co2 levels.- wrong in the link. Co2 temperature relationship from non ice core proxies conflict with this data. Actual experiments - no forcing in an open system. Co2 as a "Heat trapping gas" in an open system it doesn't. After saturation there is no effect.

Let's shoot at a barn all day then draw a target around the best cluster. All 70+ are invalid since they fail to prove the concept with even 1. The actual warming is closets to result with CO2 having NO affect. NASA Giss are still telling lies on their website. https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/carbon-dioxide/ the 1st graph is correct, then the lies start. For a start there is no imperial evidence CO2 is the main reason for driving climate change or that CO2 drives temperature at all since temperature leads CO2. This is apparent in the vostok data they took the 2nd graph from though the time lag of 100's of years is bound to be off due to the resolution of the record: Petit, J.-R., Jouzel, J., Raynaud, D., Barkov, N.

Science of the total environment, 114, 227-284. https://www.co2web.info/stoten92.pdf Glacial records for CO2 are monotonic and so do not reflect what was actually in the atmosphere. It creates nice hockey stick graphs though. We can examine the popular claim the CO2 was not over 280PPM for millions of years again here. (the crooks at NASA GISS cite 300) 425PPM 13000 years ago: Steinthorsdottir, M., Wohlfarth, B., Kylander, M. E., Blaauw, M., & Reimer, P. J. (2013).

Fakery. The next point being CO2 as a climate "Forcer" is also nonsense since climate scientists fudged the Stefan Boltzmann into climate models where new physics is invented by adding 1 part of something, it can magically heat 2500 parts around it. (Happer an expert on Co2 is ignored) I won't dwell there as that is another debunking pathetic climate models unfit for purpose and never proof tested. They contrived a "Forcing" but ignored saturation and Kirchhoff's Law of Thermodynamics (that an absorber of thermal radiation MUST also be an emitter. There are no exceptions) Thus, CO2 also has a cooling effect on the upper atmosphere since it provides a way for heat to be liberated to space (as do other gasses) CO2 follows temperature rise, it is not the driver of it: O. Humlum et al. / Global and Planetary Change 100 (2013) 51–69 https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257343053_The_phase_relation_between_atmospheric_carbon_dioxide_and_global_temperature.

The system is an adiabatic mechanism not restricted either and we can calculate a theoretical doubling of CO2 as cited by Holmes: Holmes, R. I. (2018).

Note the last vid at the bottom is the actual experiment. The jar loaded with CO2 under the heat lamp is marginally cooler.

How can you have cooling and heating at the same time according to you? This reminds me a bit of using erroneous tree ring data that we now know is garbage, but still use. If temperatures are trending down without global warming then global warming is a good thing. Humans can tolerate the heat far better than cold. I remember scientists freaking out about a coming ice age in the 70's. Now THAT is a scary proposition. Humans had better get used to the concept that the planet doesn't give two fucks about us and that the temperature will be changing going forward with or without us. I'm fairly certain we can adapt. BTW, I don't think you provided a citation for your error bar claim. I would like to look at your data.

The 150 year thing was a bit of a cheat by governments so they didn't have to act sooner. Fact is the warming started earlier than that. And when scientists talk about keeping temperatures below 1.5 degrees - they mean preindustrial levels. We are already over 1C above pre-industrial and the models show we could crack the 1.5C barrier (not average, just a single year) in the next five years. The figure I gave was from an IPCC report and was for a single year. The little iceage is also - not really what it sounds like. It was a short term cooling isolated to the parts of the northern hemisphere - it was not a worldwide event. I say we should be cooling, because we are still technically still in an ice age. We are in a warm interglacial period. When we take out the effect of global warming - temperatures trend down.

Mine is from a Stanford study done a few years ago. I can find the exact source if you like. I'm pretty sure the current consensus is for 0.8C above 150 years ago, but it depends on when you measure it, because it fluctuates all the time. Also, what makes you say we should be in a cooling period? We just came out of the "little ice age" about 150 years ago followed by a period of warming, which happens every time we see one of these. Coincidentally, that is when "climate scientists" like to start the clock on whether the Earth is warming or not.

I mean - this is actually pretty simple as I said - because we can exclude all the usual drivers of climate change. We know we are supposed to still be in a cooling period. But we also know we have increased CO2 levels to their highest level in over a million years. And we know the extra CO2 in the atmosphere is a very specific type only created in the burning of fossil fuels. This currently the only factor that we cannot exclude as a cause of the warming. You keep talking about this speculation - but I really don't think that is the case. You're margin of error figure is a bit odd too - for instance, 2018 was reported as 1.0C above pre-industrial times with a margin of error of +/-0.13C.

I'm talking about them being more concerned about political messaging than the actual science. And some scientists agree with that crazy girl from Sweden, some don't. Almost all agree that the Earth has warmed 0.8C over the last 150 years with a margin of error of 0.98C. Beyond that it's mostly speculation in regards to drivers and predictions. The man made correlation has broken so many times it's hilarious that anyone takes that hypothesis seriously. While we do contribute, it's doubtful we are the primary driver.

But now, when there are fires in the summer, they call it proof of global warming. The thing was that they managed the forests back then, and fires were not catastrophic. Nowadays, it's illegal to clear brush, and whole forests go to insect rot because of the environmentalist movement, which Weyerhauser contributes $$$ to, because the environmental regulations puts the small loggers out of business, driving up the price of lumber.

There is no single focus on climate science, or rather that is just one aspect. But there is a huge range of different sciences (physics, chemistry, geology, biology, hydrology, history, engineering etc etc etc) that are all looking at different aspects of climate change. It's not like there is a single room with all the climate scientists in there. Many of these scients are paid regardless of the outcome - climate change or not - you still need these people to measure what they are measuring. A lot of climate related findings has come from work done by scientists to predict rainfall for farmers for instance. That doesn't get paid more or less if there is climate change or not. This is also work that is done in almost every country on earth. Some private, some government some funded by donations. And yet they are all finding - no matter what angle they come from - what political party the follow - what culture or country - that climate change is a real, and existential threat to our civilisation. This climate gate story is so goddam laughable - because a) it mistakes honest science with fraud - because they don't understand how data normalisation works (i.e. historic temperature gauges that used to be in a field, but are now in the middle of a city must have their data adjusted) b) because they didn't realise that if you left the original data alone - it actually would have resulted in stronger position for global warming... and b) Climate scientists are not paid huge sums of money - they would just have other science jobs - the financial incentive is a weird angle.

You seem to be listening to the character assassins, and not to Dyson's opinions, which are easily accessed, here at You Tube. The facts are that he talks about the increase of carbon and global warming, and he is not afraid of global warming from carbon emissions because they level off after a couple of degrees increase. You won't hear him say that global warming is exponential. It's not a runaway train. He is in fact against the increase of carbon emission by mankind, something you are unaware of. It's not because of the climate hysteria, but rather an issue of ozone layer destruction. He also gave advice on how the United States could sequester enough carbon in the ground to offset the increase of coal fired power plants in China. A strategy that beats the hell out of the Paris Climate Agreement, which does nothing to curb the building of coal fired power plants in China and India. If by some quirk, you were lax in your character assassination approach to science, and were curious about the CO2 molecule in the atmosphere....about the various vibrations, and frequencies and sunlight reflection properties, you might want to watch this except from this lecture, in which Dyson is in the audience. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8iEEO2UIbA&t=25m10s	UCuH31jHKz9PcTMsdGsCqf2g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuH31jHKz9PcTMsdGsCqf2g	1	Ugz58ZZXahtj2XcO_Yd4AaABAg	Jon Claerbout

There is a plethora of evidence observational and peer reviewed which clearly proves that humanity’s 270 year uncontrolled experiment has and is ALTERING BOTH THE CLIMATE AND ITS RATE OF CHANGE which has no analog in the geological record. The closest examples are the PETM and the Permian mass extinction both took many magnitudes longer to achieve what humanity has already accomplished.

Funding for research was diverted to modeling. There still are some scientists who think scientific research produces more advances in understanding climate than computer modeling. I suppose we can call those who don't value climate models as contrarians. But, I think it more accurate to say that people who want computer models have little use for scientific research, and assume that the modeling is true. The thing is, if the models don't give you the results you are looking for, you can adjust the models to get your desired results. And governments are wanting proof of man-made global warming. And that's not science.	UCuH31jHKz9PcTMsdGsCqf2g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuH31jHKz9PcTMsdGsCqf2g	1	Ugz58ZZXahtj2XcO_Yd4AaABAg	Jon Claerbout

I had to look at 10 pages of searching "hurricanes climate change" to find a doubter. And skimming down the titles on those 10 pages, there were many duplicates, triplicates, before finding the other side of the argument. The information that is available to you has been filtered through people with an axe to grind. On page 11 in Bing search engine, I found this article https://www.heritage.org/environment/commentary/can-we-blame-hurricanes-climate-change-not-so-fast I agree that the climate is changing, and that the Earth is warming. However, the effects of CO2 level off, they don't go exponential. The melting permafrost frees up methane, but the methane is short lived, and turns into CO2, mostly. The hotter it gets, the more clouds. The increase in CO2 promotes greater vegetation, which means more roots, and it that way, more CO2 is stored in the ground. I'm not against reducing CO2 emissions, but I would want it done without putting people out of work. China and India, who are building hundreds of coal fired power plants, have planted millions of trees lately, literally millions. There are practical ways of sequestering carbon, and the biosphere is where it is possible to do it. Dyson is for reducing CO2. He recommends developing crops and trees with deeper roots to sequester more CO2 in the ground. He said that to counter the effect of China's building coal fired power plants, the United States could increase it's top soil by 2% each year. There is a lot of arid lands, and depleted soil in America, and increasing the top soil is a practical idea. http://calling-muggins.blogspot.com/2020/06/green-mob-bullies-forbes-magazine.html	UCuH31jHKz9PcTMsdGsCqf2g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuH31jHKz9PcTMsdGsCqf2g	1	Ugz58ZZXahtj2XcO_Yd4AaABAg	Jon Claerbout

Do you think for a moment that man-made global warming is not the litmus test for gainful employment at university? As far as "...the data...", when the system is funded by governments which are politically motivated to promote the man-made global warming hysteria, you get such organizations as the IPCC and their "adjusted" data which produces the results which they were organized in the first place to arrive at: the Hockey Stick. One look at the Hockey Stick, and you understand why people are repeating, as if it were some catechism that climate change is exponential. Ask one of these talking heads what element of climate change is exponential, and you're in for a bevy of insults. And it's so easy not to ever consider the nasty goings on with the email scandal, and lawsuit against Mark Steyn, and the bullying,...the unbiased process of scientific inquiry was abandoned decades ago concerning climate change. And those leftist cults stand ready to cancel anyone. That's why it's now accepted that men can becomes women, and you're smart if you don't get into that mess. Or else.

There are plenty of folks who also believe in this exponential element to climate change, and maybe they can help you out with the explanation of how the climate changes exponentially, or whatever you meant by that. It appears to me that you are repeating things you heard, that might be false, but repeated so many times that it's accepted as Gospel. It's a catechism. Are you a true believer or a blasphemer? You don't question the climate change dogma as a young scientist. You risk your career because the dogma of climate change is a hot potato, being very political. The believers will cancel your career if you go public with doubts, in only a few hours. It is a career decision. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtRCXAV8SyM&t=5s For this same reason, scientists do not comment on whether a man can transform into a woman.

If you source most of these complaints back, they come from ex-oil executives and employees of fossil fuel companies. You've been duped beyond belief. These arguments you are using are just flawed. The hockey stick graph was redone btw to address some of the original concerns - from scratch - using different methods. It came to the same conclusion. The other problem is that we have a myriad of other ways, from ice-cores, to geology, to sediments and so forth to confirm the temperatures, and it keeps coming back to the same conclusion - we are experiencing the hottest climate on record for more than 100,000. With new evidence suggesting, it may be the hottest for 1,000,000 years. I'd have much more time for deniers, if they could produce "evidence" that wasn't clearly an attempt to skew the original data in a way that is misleading. But they don't, because they can't. It's such a give away... In the past two days I've had a graph produced to me that was supposed to demonstrate that temperatures haven't changed - I sourced the graph (because the title was removed) - and it was only from the mainland US (i.e. that is not global climate). I had someone else send me another graph that purportedly showed the same thing. Again, no title. I sourced the graph. Showed Troposphere temperatures. Completely irrelevant. I've had a graph sent to me that purported to show a decline in temperatures. Sourced the graph, was a zoomed in series from a larger graph that showed temperatures rising. I'm not stupid - ffs.

I also am somewhat puzzled after the email scandal and the fact that the IPCC has "adjusted" data, and the Hockey Stick graph which does not show the warming back a thousand years ago, or the warming in the 1930s, but you still have confidence in their findings. On the other hand, maybe Dyson and Happer are bought off, too. Certainly, Happer has been accused of being bought off, but isn't that what vested interests do? Don't they want to discredit the source, rather than argue the data? And are we to believe that Dyson is bought off, or maybe he's just too old? Have you listened to any of his interviews on the topic? They are very interesting. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiKfWdXXfIs&t=3m22s	UCuH31jHKz9PcTMsdGsCqf2g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuH31jHKz9PcTMsdGsCqf2g	1	Ugz58ZZXahtj2XcO_Yd4AaABAg	Jon Claerbout

And yet the results are pretty uniform. The IPCC scientists makes no money from the reports, and I would argue that for many scientists the outcome of the result does not determine the funding. They would be running models regardless because we have a vested interest in the climate in all scenarios - good or bad. It's not at all a good argument.

You might want to watch one or more of his interviews to get a better idea of what and why he has his opinions. Not all scientists will agree that the models have been correct. One of the problems is that most scientists are trying to make a living, and they may see their walking papers if they don't dance around the facts a little. What seems to be consistent is that most of the scientists who disagree with the current global warming scare are retired, and not connected to our left leaning universities. Politics is affecting science. You can see this when there is the debate about men becoming women. There are no scientists speaking up. In our cancel culture environment, scientists want their paychecks, because they have house payments, wives, and children to support and send to university.

He has stated that the earth is warming. He agrees that the carbon emissions have warmed the planet, and this may be wrong, he thinks there is a limit to the warming to be done by carbon. If I interpret him correctly, he thinks there are benefits to increased carbon, one of them being the increased vegetation worldwide. However, he is for reducing carbon emissions because carbon in the atmosphere attacks the ozone layer.

The freeze line is moving south every year, limiting crop production. This will continue for another 20 to 40 years.

Ugwwxcf-RMtyh7JBVhx4AaABAg	0	0	2020-06-12 14:38:13	Robert Lynch	I just wish that the scientists involved would not just refrain, but entirely censure themselves from using logic that includes forgone conclusions. <br /><br />For instance, at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fkCo_trbT8&amp;t=29m11s">29:11</a>, Prof. Palmer says, &quot;the only way to reduce that risk is to reduce our emissions&quot;. This in fact is false. IF (and I really do not doubt the improbability of it being so), if the increased CO₂ fraction annually accumulating in the atmosphere is increasing the risk for chaotically unpredictable (in specific), but predictable in general increases in extreme weather events and unlivable conditions, then the good professor should have said, &quot;the least controversial way to reduce risk (of these events and conditions) is to reduce the accumulation of CO₂ in the global atmosphere&quot;.<br /><br />Maybe that is too subtle for most, but it hits the real nail directly on its head. The problem is not CO₂ emissions per se, but the accumulation of those emissions each and every year, for the last 100 years, unabated. Say 50 years… per the graph presented at the outset of the video. The first 50 years was a “wiggly line” (using Sabine&#39;s terminology), that with a few ups-and-downs was largely flat. Flat-ish. Visibly flat on the timescale shown. Good enough! The next 30, 40, 50 years the curve veers upward, punctuated by a few relatively &#39;uninspiring&#39; volcanic eruptions loading the stratosphere with a bunch of SO₂ / H₂SO₄ sulfuric acids aerosol. Which is washed out by meteorological processes, in a few years. <br /><br />Not shown (really, really vexingly!) is the instrumentally measured CO₂ atmospheric loading levels. I could write an diatribe on that alone. (How dare any discussion of CO₂→climate change theory fail to include BOTH the CO₂ and the climate-change metrology? HOW?)<br /><br />But barring that, and remembering that there is a high correlation in observed CO₂ loading measurements and the attendant tropospheric mean temperature rise, one again can see that the problem is CO₂ accumulation. Where the CO₂ accumulation increases CO₂ absolute fraction, which through thermodynamic and atmospheric transport physics, in turn thickens Earth&#39;s &#39;blanket&#39;, leading to higher ground temperatures, on average. <br /><br />So how then to reduce the accumulation?<br /><br />Sure, like what I took offense to initially, one says, &quot;emit less CO₂&quot;, or at the limit &quot;emit NO CO₂&quot;, and then follow up with &quot;soon&quot;, or &quot;now&quot;, or ridiculously, &quot;yesterday!&quot; … sure, that would seem to be one solution. As the pair of scientists know though, it isn&#39;t just a pölïtically red-hot and essentially unsolvable issue at present, but it also hides civilization&#39;s dependence not just on CO₂ production for heating, electricity and vehicular propulsion, but it is really only a half-answer too. The OTHER answer, and I argue the more complete one is, &quot;… reduce accumulation of CO₂&quot;. <br /><br />That is an entirely different premise actually. We all have likely read endlessly glib articles about artificial leaves (photosynthesis to absorb CO₂), of markedly large investments in certain kinds of high CO₂ tree growing, of aquaculture of vast beds of algae (and sinking them to the abyssal deep); we&#39;ve maybe heard of spreading billions of tons of crushed olivine on beaches worldwide, of ever-so-slightly fertilizing huge swaths of the open ocean with iron, phosphorus and whatever else trace elements they need to step up the phytoplankton ecosphere they support, again ensconcing CO₂ to the abyssal dead-plankton drift. <br /><br />See? Mankind could invest in a relatively modest remediation industry, and accomplish with good science what pölïtically — at the current time — is untenable. Untenable and having a badly laughable amount of handwaving an picture taking by an endless tribe of ineffectual politicians and pölïtically motivated pseudoscientists … to massively cut emissions .... which just doesn&#39;t happen. <br /><br />One need look no further than the world-output of crude oil discovery, development and refinery input deliveries. The drumbeat of the activists loudly calls for emission reduction. The crude oil, coal and natural gas deliveries continue to increase. Activists, zero. Consumers, 1. <br /><br />But back to the complaint: I just wish the scientists involved were HARD in their representation of the science itself. Mitigate the accumulation of CO₂, and apparently according to nearly all the models, as clean or wobbly as they might be, apparently we will realize a substantially reduced risk of ecological and environmental collapse. <br /><br />⋅-⋅-⋅ Just saying, ⋅-⋅-⋅<br />⋅-=≡ GoatGuy ✓ ≡=-⋅	UC5SlM2su8TvNYBd9vYGYRUg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5SlM2su8TvNYBd9vYGYRUg	0

Some descriptions and predictions were short of the mark, others were over it, but on balance, most of them are scarily accurate.<br /><br />The important takeaway from this interview is that science is never &quot;done&quot;. Descriptions can become more accurate, which increases the accuracy of their predictions.<br /><br />So, while we may not be heading exactly due East on Route 42, we&#39;re definitely far East of West Bumble. &quot;Wrong&quot; would mean that we should still be in West Bumble, or at least headed West out of it instead.

Just looking at the lack of confidence in his voice and his twitching and stammering compared to Dr. Hossenfelder&#39;s steady confidence says everything.

The temperature sample data size and distribution of the sample data over the lifetime of the earth and the projected lifetime of the earth is statistically insignificant. It would be like taking sample temperatures over five minutes and predicting the temperature for the next 100 years. - I wrote the following counter rubbish a couple years ago to attempt to make a point. - Based on some quick Google searches,<br />The Earth is 4.543 billion years old.<br /><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_Earth">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_Earth</a><br />The Earth&#39;s habitable-zone lifetime is 7.79 billion years.<br /><a href="http://www.nature.com/news/earth-s-days-are-numbered-1.13788">http://www.nature.com/news/earth-s-days-are-numbered-1.13788</a><br />The earliest time that temperatures could have been measured against a scientific uniform scale would have to have been after the Fahrenheit scale was created.<br />Fahrenheit is a temperature scale based on one proposed in 1724 by Amsterdam-based physicist Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit.<br /><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit</a><br />We are currently at 2017 so we subtract 1724 to get the length of time temperatures could have been measured with any reasonable consistency.<br />2017-1724=293<br />We can calculate we have been able to reasonably measure the Earth’s temperatures for approximately 293 years.<br />Then we compare the time of available sample data against the projected life of the Earth. <br />293 / 7,790,000,000 or 0.0000000376 of the Earth&#39;s life.<br />Then we go to Wikipedia to learn what is defined as a statistically relevant sample size.<br />There are a lot of formulas there that would hurt my brain.<br /><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_size_determination">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_size_determination</a>.<br />Then I looked on <a href="http://dummies.com/">dummies.com</a><br /><a href="http://www.dummies.com/education/math/statistics/how-to-determine-the-minimum-size-needed-for-a-statistical-sample/">http://www.dummies.com/education/math/statistics/how-to-determine-the-minimum-size-needed-for-a-statistical-sample/</a><br />There is a nice table<br />For an 80% confidence level, you would need a z* value of 1.28<br />Now compare 1.28 to 0.0000000376 and you can see that it far beyond a statistically relevant sample size.<br />When the media says that all scientists agree that the Earth is getting warmer they are focusing on one small point removed from the entire context. A scientist would only be willing to say that based on the available data you can run a calculation and see that the average number is getting larger. I do not believe any credible scientist would make a broad sweeping scientific statement based on the limited sample data. If you were to read the entirety of a scientific report and not just a short clip, it would have to have statements allowing for the sample size and many other variables.

This is obviously a factor in the Co2 output on this planet but one cannot blame the whole problem on this. Our polar ice caps are melting releasing a lot of fresh water into the sea, which undoubtedly cause many changes to our biosphere. However, we must also look at the changes to other planets in our solar system at the same time. The ice caps on Mars are also decreasing at an increasing rate but I very much doubt that this is because millions of martians are driving around in automobiles and burning fossil fuels. The one combining factor in the whole equation is solar activity, which rarely gets a mention. Solar activity has a profound affect on our seas, which are one of the main factors in releasing Co2 from sea beds. Hence the warming of our seas. <br />There are many things which are happening right now, in recent years the decreasing ice in Norway? led to the finding of a Viking sword which was previously buried under ice halfway up a mountain. This would indicate that the sword did not work its way down through the ice, but was laid there and covered in later years. I would also bring your attention to the Viking race as a whole, who used to be a peaceful farming community. I would presume that the change in climate at that period in time led to the destruction of their farming capabilities which led them to set to sea to engage in raids on more southern, warmer climates. A race to survive so to speak. This is all evident in history. All this points to solar cycles which affects not only our planet but also others in our system as we can now see with our technology with other planets such as Mars. <br />Unfortunately the monetary system we have here on Earth is led by many high level &quot;opportunists&quot; who can see this whole thing as an opportunity to squeeze even yet more taxes out of the population in general. I despair of the people who govern us.	UCfA89tX6ewYEdw1r-ku8Dug	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfA89tX6ewYEdw1r-ku8Dug	0

Termperature readings are taken mostly in built-up areas, which are warmer than suroundings: temperature readings at related urban and rural sites show that the urban site is 6° to 11° C warmer than the rural site. Ss cities grow we can expect those temperature readings to increase too. Has this effect been controlled for in the global mean temperature estimates?

It is widely accepted that the climate models are flawed. Further, the so called solutions to date are focused on heavily taxing developed nations and then transferring the funds to corrupt third world countries. Any one who really understands power systems will tell you that green energy is not really green. It is necessary to build a second conventional power system to back up the wind solar , etc,, etc. green resources. If climate experts are in such a consensus on climate change, why cant&#39; they develop a consensus that real carbon reductions are to be found in nuclear power, or the commercialization of the thorium fuel cycle. World population is too large to return to an agrarian low tech culture. Cramming most of humanity in high rise megalopolises would lead to complete social break down. the best chance at really reducing co2 is a nuclear economy plus advanced batteries for transport. Forget fusion. It is great in theory but likely not economically feasible in our lifetimes.	UC90jQerPHbW5rNdCeZIiGCQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC90jQerPHbW5rNdCeZIiGCQ	0

UgyMlVYV9CaE1PUTuSh4AaABAg	0	0	2020-06-02 03:05:27	Tribun Averyius	Excuse me but it has not been established beyond doubt that humans are warming the planet!!! This man is following a united nations and western government left wing, Agenda 21 or Agenda 2030, political agenda to keep his funding and his position and toe the line like the many others who work for the IPCC. The western universities are full of these commie left wingers. Thousands of meteorologists, climatologists and others working in related fields consider this to be nonsense and say those computer models are essentially rubbish and cannot prove anything. Prof. Freeman Dysen also said so. Balloon and satellite measurements which are more accurate than surface based measurements show no global temperature warming of the troposphere over the last 20 odd years! Recent measurements of the Thermosphere by NASA show it has shrunk and therefore the upper atmosphere is cooling. Professor Happer of Princeton University a carbon dioxide expert, shows that only about one third to one quarter of CO2 molecules can cause back radiation since it depends upon oscillations and sizes of them. Dr. Richard Lindzen of MIT has estimated that the sensitivity of the atmosphere to green house gasses is low and has calculated a very small degree of any possible warming to be likely. In a paper by Dr. Robert Ian Holmes of the Federation University of Ballarat, Australia, &quot;Robert Ian Holmes. Thermal Enhancement on Planetary Bodies and the Relevance of the Molar Mass Version of the Ideal Gas Law to the Null Hypothesis of Climate Change. Earth Sciences. Vol. 7, No. 3, 2018, pp. 107-123. doi: 10.11648/j.earth.20180703.13&quot;, it is very likely that no one gas has an anomalous effect on atmospheric temperatures that is significantly more than any other gas. In short; there is unlikely to be any significant net warming from the greenhouse effect on any planetary body in the parts of atmospheres which are &gt;10kPa. The present ‘null hypothesis’ of climate assumes - without empirical evidence - that there is a tropospheric greenhouse effect (GHE); meaning an anomalous net warming from greenhouse gases like CO2. This effect supposedly causes significant net warming in the troposphere [24] - even though this hypothetical warming has never actually been empirically measured, quantified and then attributed to GHG in any published, peer-reviewed scientific study to date.

He further says that we don&#39;t know so much how to model big systems becaus it&#39;s difficult to model local systems. He&#39;s not sure that CO2 is causing all this but it&#39;s good society and politicians are aware that there might be some problems in the future due to living conditions. Next comes a lot of gibberish on Marshall plan to stop communism (not totally right) and people escaping from Africa or South America to Europe or North America due to climate change, I thought those poeple were escaping because the governments in their own countries are very corrupted and doesn&#39;t give a damn about the social condition of the people.

He says in a right way that those models just spit out what you input in them. Everyone who dealt even with simple calcualtions or simulations of chaos theories knows how a little change in initial conditions make huge difference at the end. What are the right initial conditions? Data from 60 , or 100 or 1000 years back? He was asking for more empirical evidence, not computer simulations. Said that, I absolutely agree with proposition that we should care about our enviroment and resources. Tim Palmer is simply building his eschatology when we need hard science instead.

Reading the IPCC reports and the executive summaries, even, and the snivelling groveling stance and tone of those portions of the reports, is horrific. Please listen! <br /><br /><br />Along with leaving out the fucking signals from things like FUCKING METHANE, because you had incomplete data. This from at least the last but one report, and I think I read the most recent dirge as well. <br /><br /><br />The models have been accurate in predicting the rise and impact of CO2, but TIMING, timing, FFS. Timing!<br /><br /><br />All I had to do to get freaked out was to graph the acceleration of the predicted future towards us, as the IPCC reports grew less and less vague and the stats stronger. And then to extrapolate that effect, oh fuck.<br /><br /><br />The reefs are gone in the next 1-5 years, and we are soon thereafter, to the extent there are still deniers they will be washed away, so to speak, within five or so years.

Happening on the poles, this could be a natural phenom that could never be forecast. Icelandic type blocking of the sun by Ash over extended periods of time is another unpredictable tangent which has major impacts. One very important study was the Freon model which meant so much in gaining a window as to how the Ozone layer needed to be fixed and now nature will regain it&#39;s power in fixing it with every lightening storm.

Stocastic calculations should only be used if you have zero data, and then it is only &#39;educated guess&#39; work. He then uses his bias in producing his model. My understanding is we now have over 17 years of satellite planetary thermograph data, and his biased model is wrong. Now we have 10k+ career &quot;scientists&quot; showing their embarrassing colours... the ugly truth... group think, egos, and cultism. You may argue that we do not have enough data to prove you are wrong, buth there is no indication in real data that you right. He didnt even talk about his magic CO2 physics... Radiation prevention is insignificant with 200ppm of CO2. He is a physicist and should know that. Deception or group think is the cause of the cultist religion. I think he followed up his physics degree his parents made him get with a life on the commune in the 70&#39;s. He even looks down during the talk and is not great with eye contact. He doesnt keep his hands out in front of himself as much as her. No tie and a hippie hair do.

It&#39;s not so much like standard calculus and I find that very irritating. In my opinion, I would assume that {0,1} and (0,1) are Equivalent, and try to derive a totally new kind of calculus such that it is profoundly ambiguous whether this new instrument is stochastic or deterministic. I think it is possible, but I have not yet succeeded, so I should probably just shut up now. However, if such a tool did exist at our disposal, it would likely make these modelling efforts (climate forecasting) much easier. That is all.

The thing Palmer mentions the MET office, amoung others, specifically does extensively. Yes, the IPCC report does some things in certain ways for political reasons. No, that does not seriously undermine the conclusions of the IPCC report. Also, the "climategate" email 'scandal' is bullshit. As are claims that models ignoring the effects of CO2 are more accurate. And speculation about some mysterious ability of the biosphere to magically absorb massive quantities of CO2 (ever heard of ocean acidification?) Maybe the people who have spent decades working on this topic have already considered the stuff you learned about last week, and much much more. Stop spreading misinformation. Stop insulting people like Palmer who actually know what the hell they are talking about. Of course Palmer asks questions. He's a scientist, that is literally the fucking job. PS: Do you not get why only rich countries run these models in a sensitivity analysis mode? The amount of compute cycles involved are staggering. It is really expensive. In a better world Bezos or Google or someone would donate a crap-ton of resources to the problem. As it stands, we rely on the largess of taxpayers, many of who think that climate scientists are idiots and grifters because they pay attention to random people on the internet telling them as much -_-	UC9m2HBsXdds19uxYcdwi7EQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9m2HBsXdds19uxYcdwi7EQ	1	Ugy2H_JkvGmN_JRqY_R4AaABAg	Little Rose Palmer

The wording "comparing the models in a stochastic manner" is from Palmer himself in this Video. If In his position you are not already discussing such nearby questions within the ipcc, there must be something wrong. How can you not compare each model with the other and with *reality* (messured observations)? Obviously it is not part of Palmers Job to ask questions. The whole synopsis is done by "the 11", the assasment report makers and they say something like "all models are equal".

You shouldn't assume people here are not educated either, or that has relevance anyway. We heard so called "Experts" waffle a load of crap decades ago. (This is not directed at Tim or Sabina. NASA Giss are still telling lies on their website. https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/carbon-dioxide/ the 1st graph is correct, then the lies start. For a start there is no empirical evidence CO2 is the main reason for driving climate change or that CO2 drives temperature at all since temperature leads CO2. This is apparent in the vostok data they took the 2nd graph from though the time lag of 100's of years is bound to be off due to the resolution of the record: Petit, J.-R., Jouzel, J., Raynaud, D., Barkov, N. I., Barnola, J.-M., Basile, I., . . . Delaygue, G. (1999). Climate and atmospheric history of the past 420,000 years from the Vostok ice core, Antarctica.

V., & Ono, N. (1992). Do glaciers tell a true atmospheric CO 2 story? Science of the total environment, 114, 227-284. https://www.co2web.info/stoten92.pdf Glacial records for CO2 are monotonic and so do not reflect what was actually in the atmosphere. It creates nice hockey stick graphs though. Alarm = funding isn't a new trick. We can examine the popular claim the CO2 was not over 280PPM for millions of years again here. (the crooks at NASA GISS cite 300) 425PPM 13000 years ago: Steinthorsdottir, M., Wohlfarth, B., Kylander, M. E., Blaauw, M., & Reimer, P. J. (2013).

Fakery. The next point being CO2 as a climate "Forcer" is also nonsense since climate scientists fudged the Stefan Boltzmann constant into climate models where new physics is invented by adding 1 part of something, it can magically heat 2500 parts around it. SB is meant for solids not gasses so they invented layers to try to get around this large problem. So your "experts" based unproven models on fudged science.(Happer an expert on Co2 was also ignored) I won't dwell there as that is another debunking pathetic climate models unfit for purpose and never proof tested. They contrived a "Forcing" but ignored saturation and Kirchhoff's Law of Thermodynamics (that an absorber of thermal radiation MUST also be an emitter. There are no exceptions. Thus, CO2 also has a cooling effect on the upper atmosphere since it provides a way for heat to be liberated to space (as do other gasses) CO2 follows temperature rise, it is not the driver of it: O. Humlum et al. / Global and Planetary Change 100 (2013) 51–69 https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257343053_The_phase_relation_between_atmospheric_carbon_dioxide_and_global_temperature.

The London, Edinburgh, and Dublin Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science, 17(98), 319-320. http://www.biocab.org/Experiment_on_Greenhouses__Effect.pdf (....which demonstrates that long wave infrared radiation is not trapped by atmospheric greenhouse gases.) all those squiggly lines on all those website sites parroting the same crap. The system is an adiabatic mechanism not restricted either and we can calculate a theoretical doubling of CO2 as cited by Holmes: Holmes, R. I. (2018).

Note the last vid at the bottom is the actual experiment. The jar loaded with CO2 under the heat lamp is marginally cooler. Bill Nye the lying science guy: https://wattsupwiththat.com/gore-and-bill-nye-fail-at-doing-a-simple-co2-experiment/ What happens to the "Heat trapping gas" if we put it inside double glazing? https://principia-scientific.org/industry-experts-co2-worse-useless-trapping-heatdelaying-cooling-2/ then there are all the wild claims about storms, accelerating sea level rises bla bla bla all unfounded media hype and frankly BS.

Everyone has the right to a voice. Politicised science has squashed those views of reality so far to a point climate change has become a cult or a religion one must dare not question. If my intelligence serves me correctly, Mr Palmer knows the game is up on CO2 as much as frau Hossenfleder does. This is why they bravely discuss climate models it here.....actually they gain respect for stepping out 1st. Loose it for dancing around this as if this is new news when it has been known for decades that the so called science framing the air we breath as some kind of poison is flat out wrong!. While an autistic teenage girl is paraded around like an experts in the climate lie MANY have stayed silent about. Societies should be tolerant according to the left (where I have been in the past) yet the left eats it's own ideological points because it's un supportive of facts. Sadly being courageous or brave is not the norm in today's society as a generalisation. Science normally embraces everyone as much as IQ is nothing to do really with education. Young bright minds soaking up the rubbish pushed into their face via a "Smart" phone, is actually popular deception. As a father myself, I urge you to get out there, talk to people (including those you may disagree with) and use all those muscles in your face combined with the complexities of human expression instead of a handful of emoji icons that supposedly the movements and moods of the human face. There are more muscles in our faces than emoji icons and few people actually laugh out loud while tapping "LOL" A collective that ignore people, is a collective of ignore(ance) the psychology behind this is simple. I quote a left leaning popular figure here Mr Stephen Fry while debating on the rights of freedoms of speech and political correctness. "I believe one of the greatest human failings is to prefer to be right, than to be effective" So very very true. I can hope Your Uncle and/or Sabine will give a thumbs up to science rather than one to being popularly wrong. It seems so here if a little light weighted.

And how do you keep count of geniuses? When you talk about intelligence in whole generations, maybe it's not geniuses, but how many above average intelligent individuals does a society produce? Like doctors and engineers? I would suggest that much intelligence is squandered by "mothering/smothering" since the 20th Century, when the intelligent person got a late start, or no start at all. How many intelligent people were stuck in hard labor because they had to support a family in a region with no vertical mobility? How many intelligent people were stunted by mind altering drugs, lead paint ingestion and other yet-to-be-identified chemicals in the environment? How many people were brought up in totalitarian societies and educated to be conformist? And really, who's keeping count of the above average individuals, or geniuses, in a generation, other than just people's perceptions of how many they noticed?

Not only the IPCC but culturally in general. It's one reason Boris J was talking about scrapping the BBC license fee. Why pay for their propaganda and child like 'fingers in the ears' "we do not debate climate deniers" while every episode of anything has to have a disproportionate representation of somewhere between a man, a woman and an it. (It being this infinite gender they try to create to appease a few weird people that one day, may well identify as a motorbike and take a shot at the tour de France. Gay lesbian, trans, Bi ok ok but when do we stop? Jordan Peterson has an excellent lecture on why the left eats itself. We have to have the right to freedom of speech, even if that offends some. I consider myself a labour man but as in America, people have had enough of this and many other things being shoved down our throats are really going backwards not forwards. When the minority have to be pandered to by the masses is akin to letting the village idiot run the show. This has infected our universities and our schools. Children being told there are not 2 genders (defying reality) and that an invisible trace gas is a danger to the earth as told by an autistic child- You can't make it up! Hypocritical elites on the side of madness. People sacked for telling the truth going against the narrative. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7j75L38PlI Back to the IPCC, they exist to prove man is some evil influence and they are part of the problem of group think. The globalist elites want the masses to transfer money into their pockets, keep them uninformed, keep them from developing (for a fatter profit margin since they can pay them less) and keep them in fear of something. Todays politics has a great number of Watermelons, (green on the outside, red in the middle). Virtue signalling their lies and socialist propaganda. Old ideals do not go away the far left and far right being equally dangerous places. Pulling down statues, public shaming....now. a left media claim mostly peaceful riots where more people died than the criminal resisting arrest shouting "I'm gonna die" way before the cop kneeled on him. The same media ignore a 5 year old boy shot in the head while riding is bike (sorry kid wrong colour) has this happened before. Got to go the red guard are at my door!

The experiments as shown show no heating effect at all since the other false claim of "...And because of our greenhouse gasses we are not cold like the moon" (or words to that effect. Planets with atmosphere's with zero greenhouse gasses have a temperature. Holmes paper demonstrates this thought it's not game over there because we have to factor ALL additional gasses to the atmosphere, not only CO2 for a more accurate calculation.

In each case I provide the paper and a link to it that should not be behind a pay wall. Holmes, R. I. (2018). Thermal Enhancement on Planetary Bodies and the Relevance of the Molar Mass Version of the Ideal Gas Law to the Null Hypothesis of Climate Change.

I cite wood here: Wood, R. W. (1909). XXIV. Note on the Theory of the Greenhouse. The London, Edinburgh, and Dublin Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science, 17(98), 319-320. http://www.biocab.org/Experiment_on_Greenhouses__Effect.pdf "....which demonstrates that longwave infrared radiation is not trapped by atmospheric greenhouse gases."! The earth does not cool at an IR spectrum affected by CO2. Also CO2 is shown to follow temperature rise not cause it. Climate alarmists on the side of pseudo science claim there was a trigger when the roles switched but provide no evidence to support this. Especially since CO2 has been around the same level as today 13000 years ago with no "trigger" then either. ~380PPM 500AD and 325PPM average <1939! The IPCC should throw out the 70+ wrong predictions and look more to the clouds, solar cycles they miss and solar activity. Lüdecke, H. J., Hempelmann, A., & Weiss, C. O. (2013). Lüdecke, H. J., Hempelmann, A., & Weiss, C. O. (2013). Multi-periodic climate dynamics: spectral analysis of long-term instrumental and proxy temperature records. Climate of the Past, 9(1), 447-452. 9(1), 447-452. https://www.clim-past.net/9/447/2013/cp-9-447-2013.pdf Indeed the IPCC ignored of forgot these climate cycles in their quest to frame CO2. The De-Vries, Yoshimura and Gleissberg cycles for example. You will see a lot of this BS claim "that CO2 has been at stable 280PPM for millions of years" it is because they use ice core data known to be wrong for CO2. Here is the paper showing this: More media BS (it string to say that but many have profited from this lie and they need calling up for it when they can't even fake an experiment properly. https://wattsupwiththat.com/gore-and-bill-nye-fail-at-doing-a-simple-co2-experiment/ I have seem Tim Palmers smirk about a Trump question in another Vid but hope at his core he is closer to science and not Pseudo science. There is actually no single paper providing evidence CO2 is a danger for our climate, only speculation far from the scientific method. Trumps advisors are correct in rejecting expensive ugly bird killing ineffective wind power (a Nazi ideology) and sticking with oil. That said if we want to make policies, they should be based on facts, not fear mongering. Nuclear is the best option if expensive to start up the safety of modern units are fantastic with the lowest waste footprint of all. Gone are the days of spent fuel rods being a hazard for 10's of thousands of years. I hope this information helps. Science beats propaganda, we had enough of that during WW2. “Not every item of news should be published. Rather must those who control news policies endeavour to make every item of news serve a certain purpose.” -- Joseph Goebbels “The bigger the lie, the more it will be believed.” -- Joseph Goebbels “The essence of propaganda consists in winning people over to an idea so sincerely, so vitally, that in the end they succumb to it utterly and can never escape from it.” -- Joseph Goebbels “The most brilliant propagandist technique will yield no success unless one fundamental principle is borne in mind constantly - it must confine itself to a few points and repeat them over and over.” ― Joseph Goebbels He could be talking about CO2 with that last one. Yes that 5% of a 0.04% trace gas that is suddenly a magic climate control dial with cherry picked data to try and prove it. It's as ridiculous as there being some new law of physics whereby adding 1 part to 2500 others will heat them all. Climate scientists also contrived a "Forcing" mechanism by miss application of the Stefan Boltzmann constant but that is another topic.

It's a matter of parenting. 20th Century psychologists convinced society that challenging children to learn is child abuse. It can be if done with meanness or force. But, the early years are crucial in the learning curve of a humans lifespan. Mozart, Beethoven, Menuhin, Mutter, and all of the early starters achieved greatness, in part because they started when they were young. One has only to look at the musical child prodigies coming out of asia to see the effect of good parenting. In the West, we wait until the child is a teen before they are taught language and music. It's a stunting of the learning process, and really, this is what abuse really is, starving a child of learning.

By now i believe that the errors made with the GHG and GHE are very axomatic, with wrong applys of the Stephan-Boltzman law and even with wrong interpretations of thermodynamics alltogether. However it still stays an unvoluntary experiment, in geological terms we add a lot of CO2 to the carbon cycle, but it all might be wholy beneficial. We measure the greening of the planet and we know from the distant past that oceans are capable of absorbing a lot more CO2.

Investigations show we are in a normal warm period and more research is needed into solar cycles. What the IPCC did was cherry pick start dates of 1850 to say "It's not the Sun" instead of when the warming actually started. (Giving TSI 20times higher than the IPCC claim) Also they missed off known climate cycles. Also they used ice core data for the CO2 proxy... It's a scientific fail after fail after fail when ignoring what does not fit a pre drawn conclusion that they exist to prove (evil man's impact on the climate) For CO2 to be a problem all of these must be true. 1. Temperature must follow CO2, that CO2 drives global temperatures. 2 The ice core record must reflect what is in the atmosphere at that time 3. most or all of the recent CO2 must have been caused by us .

I'm also just a curious lay, with a background in math and computer science, who's generally not satisfied with all the ideological bias and simplified scientific facts that are present in mainstream media. It's a slippery road as you might know, surrounded by strong believes and peer pressure for whoever doesn't adhere too much to the apocalyptic narrative and the backwards appeal to natures. It can often lead to being stigmatized by one's own peers. As a matter of fact, I believe many sadly falls into the camp of deniers as a an easy way of coping with such intellectual frustration unfortunately.

This article is 4 years old but seems to be pretty accurate: https://www.carbonbrief.org/surge-in-plant-growth-explains-slower-co2-rise-over-past-decade If this trend continues it will disturb many calculations. To my knowledge this it is not suprising at all, NASA confirmed global greening due to Co2: https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/carbon-dioxide-fertilization-greening-earth In the far past other iceages were able to absorb way more Co2 like in the ordovician, carboniferous and prmian ice ages: http://www.biocab.org/Geological_Timescale.jpg So we might observe a delayed absorption of our in geological terms very cold oceans. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that we humans are doing an involuntary experiment with earth, ading Co2 in vast ammounts. What is your "story" are you just a curious lay too? Good luck on your journey and come back if you have more questions or come to a different view. :-)	UCvnxpmGdSc_Q3-kvoenwuRQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvnxpmGdSc_Q3-kvoenwuRQ	1	Ugy2H_JkvGmN_JRqY_R4AaABAg	Little Rose Palmer

Imma put more focus on climate sensitivity uncertainty in the future during my private researches.

Unless I read you wrong (which I deem possible!) this is not matching my own findings. There seems to be a rise of CO2 over the last 150 years and so far this surge is not predicted to be cancelled out so quickly by the natural carbon life cycle on Earth?

I am just a lay, my main knowledge is from geology and paleonthology. I was looking into conspiracy theories just for fun, when it came to the "climate deniers" it got complicated and i got kind of obsessed for months with the topic. It all started with the fact that CO2 makes up 0,04% of our atmosphere. "..not possible to clearly separate/claim how much is down to the observed rise of human-made carbon isotopes in the atmosphere, as opposed to a natural climate cycle?" Exactly. Co2 Climate Uncertainty Relation if you will. "Would you disagree though that the Paris Agreement is at least aiming for the observed trajectory so far? Planning for the best... hoping for the worst essentially!" From my point of view the Paris agreement ist lost in a tautology. It is indeed aiming at a natural trend without realizing It. In an irrational manner it is decoupled from the temperature. Meaning it presumes that the reduction of Co2 *will* have a significant thermal effect. This means the Paris agreement will still be active even if it is dramaticaly cooling, despite nations failing to reduce Co2 (which is happening), untill the discrepancy is so big that no one can ignore it anymore. The dystopian part here is that this dilemma could hold many decades of ups and downs and could go on "forever" depending on how smooth the climate will change. I do not believe that it will keep warming though, compared to past warming periods we should be near the peak. It is not easy to determine what is "normal", but the past shows that changes like ours are not dramatic. To my knowledge Co2 is not rising as much as it should, the oceans and the flora seem to absorb more then Co2 expected and this is where the focus of research should shift to imo. This means that even the Co2 does not do what we expect it to do, distorting the whole calculation from another pillar.

May I ask you how much are you yourself acquainted and involved with those topics? There is just now one more thing that I've yet to understand. "At a CO2 sensitivity this low, it might forever get lost in the noise. 1,5°C does not mean CO2 "Makes" 1,5°C netto." By this do you mean that at this narrow temperature band it is so far not possible to clearly separate/claim how much is down to the observed rise of human-made carbon isotopes in the atmosphere, as opposed to a natural climate cycle? "Truth is they have advanced, if we accept the lower models as the accurate ones, we can exclude 3 and 4 degrees by now." I believe this is indeed what they should clearly say. Would you disagree though that the Paris Agreement is at least aiming for the observed trajectory so far? Planning for the best... hoping for the worst essentially!

This is a way better visualisation: https://www.drroyspencer.com/wp-content/uploads/ICCC13-DC-Spencer-25-July-2019-Global-LT-scaled.jpg Since one only needs the timeline, the instrumental data like RSS, UAH or Japan Meteo and the climate models which are accessable too, one can plot these graphs on your own, even with just a pencil and a paper. Which is kind of exciting because it excludes any manipulation. ".. carbon emissions caused by human origins have a latency of several decades" -The emissions started long ago with the industrial boom after world war 2, so the CO2 must have "arrived", there is no theory for a more then 50 year delay (?) . The atmosphere, unlike the oceans, reacts pretty much immediatly, 80%-90% of the molecules are in the lowest layer, the troposphere. Gases dispense quickly under the law of basicly diffusion, countered by gravity. So most of the CO2 is already where it will remain right from the start. The question if CO2 takes a long-travel way to enrich the higher layers like the stratophere, i find it hard to find material about the higher spheres.. The startosphere is cooling, one could say dramaticly. https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/state-climate-2011-stratospheric-temperature Well the IPCC has a simple and at first glance good task: We gather information world wide and refine a report on how dangerous CO2 is. However, I think biase and corruption beside that the IPCC is in a dilemma: They might *never* be able to seperate natural forcings from the CO2 thermal effect. With the ipcc 1,5 scenario and the Paris Agreement on 1,5°C we impalpably accept the former lowest threshold of 1,5°C as the new threat. At a CO2 sensitivity this low, it might forever get lost in the noise. 1,5°C does not mean CO2 "Makes" 1,5°C netto. 1,5 still just means the the lowest trend we could think of, no one expects a flat line or even cooling after all and maybe they took the temperature trend from the past, which came true since it is actualy a pretty constant trend, not accelerating unlike the CO2 increase: https://ds.data.jma.go.jp/tcc/tcc/products/gwp/temp/ann_wld.html 1,5°C might also just be the result of 3°C plus minus 1,5. Since 10 years ago everyone was afraid of 3°C, 3 was the best estimate. In other words: The IPCC would have to say: We have to say that we have not advanced in 30 years. Truth is they have advanced, if we accept the lower models as the accurate ones, we can exclude 3 and 4 degrees by now.

I consider myself a skeptical inquirer and I truly appreciate the value of dissonant voices/hints in any topic. I hope you don't mind me asking further questions. You say that the lowest models are the one that retroactively match today's temperatures. The link you give gives no information about this tho, it's just a ranking of the models depending on the temperature trends, a ranking of the variations between forecast and observed temperature would be what I would expect here as evidence of the point you make? Regarding climate sensitivity as far as I know the impact of carbon emissions caused by human origins have a latency of several decades, how much of the theoretical variations could be truly observed as of today? I mostly agree with you regarding IPCC. Again coming from a skeptical approach, this institution seems to suffer from ideological and scientific biases, here and there. Overall, I have not gathered enough knowledge about the IPCC to have more than an educated guess on the matter. Thanks!

No. The modells are legit, they are of course the result of what you put in. The obvious question is which Models meet the observation after 30 years? (including hindcast), the answer is: The lowest Models. https://www.drroyspencer.com/wp-content/uploads/ICCC13-DC-Spencer-25-July-2019-Global-LT-ranking-scaled.jpg The next logical question would be why are the lowest models accurate? The answer is: Because they neglect CO2 as driver. This leads to the question why the ipcc is telling us a different story and why we are not talking more about the models in the first place. The political answers you can find in climategate. If you want scientific answers you might start with the question "How much CO2 causes how much temperature?" (Co2 Climate Sensitivity). Wikipedia mentions that the ipcc is not doing research themselves, they put together the data they collect and merge them into reports for policy makers. The problem is that the whole issue is so polarized, that the ipcc became a political organization and my opinion is that an advocatus diavoli, a falsification organ would have been a healthy way to keep the scientific method and ethics.

But i think the "climategate" e-mails they speak for themself: https://www.lavoisier.com.au/articles/greenhouse-science/climate-change/climategate-emails.pdf Palmer made one crucial point himself: Why are the climate models not compared in a stochastic manner, would that not just be the next logical step to compare them and ask why the lowest ones meet the observations by now, asking for the "ingredients" causing these different results? Being a scientist like him stumbling about this question i would truly ask myself if what i am doing here is science after all. The list of former scientists that left the ipcc for scientific reasons is pretty impressive. Him asking these questions himself, maybe after Hossenfelder pointed them out, show that he is not discussing these things with other parts of the ipcc, which is sad and wierd and in the end bs, nothing but bureaucracy, collecting data, modelling and only the political bureau will interpretate everything. There is no room for theorizing and debate whithin the ipcc, it lacks an organ of falsification. This role of falsification is put to fringe, experts like Lindzen, Christy, Curry, Shaviv are named and shamed and excluded since the debate got extremely polarized.

Average temperature is a complex function which has been misrepresented by Denier “Science Communicators” such as JoNova as being purely representing the average of maximum temperatures. Average temperature is the summation of temperature and time and is complexed by atmospheric humidity levels. This has allowed science fakes to say “see, here is my graph of daily temperature maximums and the temperature in my area has increased at all so the climate bureau is wrong, they are faking their results”. The average temperature takes into account the temperature averaged over the whole day, and what actually happens is that the average night time temperature increases to the extent that the temperature over the whole 24 hours is constant but might actually be lower than the historical maximum for that time of year. So the real figure is that average atmospheric energy content which also includes the energy content of the atmospheric moisture as well (noting here that a high humidity tends to suppress temperature deviation so again the average temperature can be lower than historic temperature maximums taken when humidity was lower). It is that total picture which then feeds into what the Climate Changes will be for any one area. Climate Scientists have failed to educate the Media in the past as to how this all adds up to what Climate Change, driven by Global Warming&lt; is all about. The Media is allowing itself to catch up a bit where it suits their corporate interests. My simple explanation method is to say “put a large pan of water on the stove and turn up the heat a little. Observe how the water begins to circulate. Now turn the heat up some more. Observe how the water movement increases and changes. This is what is happening in our atmosphere. More energy means more overturning ie Climate Change”.	UC4ircU5sbntOYDrEf5Hj6wA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4ircU5sbntOYDrEf5Hj6wA	0

It is a complex thing alltogether but if you want to talk about the bigger picture you should talk about the Charney formula. Arrhenius was thinking of a CO2 climate sensitivty of 5°C to 6°C, the ipcc Charney formula expected a warming of 3°C plus-minus 1,5°C. By now we are below that lowest threshold of 1,5°C. After 30 years of modelling the modell called "INMCN4" is the one that matches observations best. INMCN4 uses a CO2 forcing of x4, neglecting the greenhouse effect. You see, it is not that complicated after all, the ipcc and you would just have to accept it. 1910 to 1940 had the same rate of warming as recent decades, without the vast human emissions.

If your understanding of a process is poor, your model is going to be poor.<br /><br /><br />At the time I was in college physicists were trying to build models of star fusion. All the models were woefully bad. As our understanding has increased, so have the models gotten better. But it is still fiendishly difficult to build a model of how a star burns its fuel. There is just so much to consider. And this is relatively simple in comparison to all the processes present in an ecosphere which can affect things.<br /><br /><br />We need to keep trying to understand. But we must admit how much we actually know.. and understand that when politicians say &#39;the science is settled&#39;, it is a straight up lie.

Mathematical models are built off of first principals, our understanding of the fundamentals. Please understand that there also exist statistical estimators as a class of model. For example, some temperature models are built using ARIMA. Such models can generalize well to lots of situations, but are subject to more influence by data choice. Much like training a neural net.

For Example, Factually Droughts can "Increase" in Area Size, Total Number per Year per Decade or Increase in Severity including the Temperatures Associated with Droughts. Droughts will Also Increase because of the Positive Feedback that occurs at the Drought Locations, hence they are growing Bigger and Bigger in Area and Temperature. The same with Storms, Storms can be Bigger in Area and Wind Intensity because Local Climate change has occurred. Hence the Storm Will Factually "Change" to a Different behaviour, some Locations will Experience Storms they Never Experienced before. On and On the Climate Change goes.

Asian climate in hopes of finding a way to provide credible predictions of monsoons, because S. Asian and particularly Indian agriculture desparately depends on timing planting relative to onset, duration and amount of monsoonal precipitation. It was around 2014 that govt of India announced it&#39;s conclusions of decades of study: the onset, duration and amount of precipitation are totally random. That was a bit of a disappointment. As an aside they claimed to see no signal of AGW in monsoon data. Then India announced it would be the world&#39;s most super super computer so that maybe some predictive signal or trends could be teased out.

It is churlish to suggest that this warming has anything at all to do with human produced carbon. With oceans being the largest sink for carbon, it seems only plausible or rather instructive to take into consideration the amount of carbon being released from the oceans, add to that volcanic activity, and to that the burning of forests whether natural or not. I don&#39;t think anyone in their right mind has suggested that climate change doesn&#39;t occur. What is in question, is whether those changes in climate can be sheeted home to humans. Perhaps we could start with looking at the activity of cellular respiration and breathing or exhalation rather. Each person on a daily bases exhales 1kg of carbon, and so with 7 billion people on the planet that equates to 7,000,000,000 kgs which works out to be 7,000,000 tons a day. Should we all stop breathing? This doesn&#39;t even take into consideration the vast number of animals exhaling CO2 each day. <br />So does climate modelling take this fact into consideration when predictions are made?

El ninos and ninas happen again and again. No one ever explained the cooling of the 70s, when CO2 was in full effect. No one explained the hiatus, the pause to the fullest. There is no studies needed, i was a lot on the skeptical science side, arguing back and forth. You can look at the Charney formula of the ipcc, with the discovery of man made human CO2 we set ourselfs a frame in which temperatures will rise by 3°C plus-minus 1,5°C with a doubling of CO2. By now we reached 412ppm, 40% of the doubling is done, the trend goes towards 1,5°C and below. You can use your own brain looking at our temperatures, the trend is steady and not accelerating, while the CO2 skyrockets away. One of the lowest models of the ipcc is called "INMCN4", it meets the observations pretty good. This modell uses a factor of x4 regarding CO2, neglecting the greenhouse effect. Stop being lazy by pointing at a bunch of "studies" on an alarmist side, btw the side that is responsible for the infamous 97% Cook study. Talk in your own words, pointing at some studies, letting me analyse them all, is a cheap trick that i have come across over and over again. If YOU want to learn something then you should read the comment section of "skepticalScience", this is were the real magic happens, the skeptics have the real arguments, countered by stupid consensus soldiers, always the same guys, while the moderators drasticly sanctionise the skeptics, at least by now. You might also realize that 10 years ago everyone was talking about the 3°C warming, now this can only be accomplished with ominos tipping points. By now, secretly without notice, we talk about 1,5°C, as if nothing has happened, only the older ones realize this if at all. https://images.app.goo.gl/QPSt14Kj38fR3RkU8	UCvnxpmGdSc_Q3-kvoenwuRQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvnxpmGdSc_Q3-kvoenwuRQ	1	UgxYdoO_mrKKI9ObveV4AaABAg	Big Red

I said humans are causing a rise in CO2, this called the elephant in the room. I did not say that humans are not breaking the CO2 cycle. The question is how much does CO2 contribute to global warming. So once again: Can you explain why 1910 to 1940 already warmed at the same rate as today, without the majority of human CO2 emissions? https://images.app.goo.gl/swmiDZvbHwBbxf5R9 https://images.app.goo.gl/56NfHxYirfNDxYkSA	UCvnxpmGdSc_Q3-kvoenwuRQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvnxpmGdSc_Q3-kvoenwuRQ	1	UgxYdoO_mrKKI9ObveV4AaABAg	Big Red

Big Red has a point, our breath emits more CO2 then our cars, however, it is true that this is already included in the "projections". CO2 was never stable, it always increased with warming and dropped with cooling, 1700 was still within the little ice age. Ofc humans added a lot of CO2, this is the elephant in the room. You are pretty arrogant trying to teach Big Red here, considering how unaccurate your own knowledge is. There is no evidence that "it is enough to throw the ballance off", you are making assumption after assumption. If you would try to find evidence for all the things you just stated as true and known, you might be suprised how hard it will be for you to find them.

Uh no. this post is probably too long to read but i want to get my thoughts down.<br /><br /><br />Hossenfelder noticed something usually missing from climate graphs: the absolute world temperature. it ranges from 12.5 to 15.5 degrees. that all by itself tells me the temperatures are not converging on anything and the models are not super accurate. over time they just point more or less in the same direction. here is a fun question: has any model been run to confirm the little ice age and other points of interest in the past 1000 years? is there any periodicity in IPCC models?<br /><br /><br />at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fkCo_trbT8&amp;t=8m30s">8:30</a> climate mainstreamer Palmer is telling us climate scientists use a kitchen sink approach to simulating the world. all the laws of physics are in there including back radiation differing in the weighting of each subfactor. unfortunately back radiation from CO2 is doubtful. backradiation is used to explain why earth isn&#39;t a deep freeze but the CO2 level has to be exactly right or there will be global warming. anyway the assumption is you can take horizontal slices of atmosphere, do a calculation and integrate the slices to get a net radiation transfer at the top of the troposphere. ok but remember 1) the natural temperature drop of 6 degrees per km of height has to be confirmed by the model and 2) the inverse square law of light has to apply to infrared radiation coming from the warm ground and 3) the emissivity of objects is dependent on the material and the temperature.<br /><br /><br /><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fkCo_trbT8&amp;t=14m17s">14:17</a> Hossenfelder asks another legit question. why do these graphs not have error bars? when you read your backyard thermometer and declare the temperature to be 24 degrees it is understood the measurement is 24 plus or minus a half degree based on the lines on the scale. Palmer says maybe only the big boys can run their model multiple times with a few reasonable permutations to get an error spread. that is bad science and must be embarassing to say out loud. his only concession was to say use the variation between the models in absence of anything better. to me that means there is an error bar of plus or minus half a degree for each data point you calculate. so how much error by year 2100? <br /><br /><br />17 minutes why do the models diverge from each other? because even if you have pressure humidity and other variable in a grid zone of atmosphere there is no formula to say if that area has zero cloud cover total clouds or half and half. plus the grids are kilometers in size. a lot of detail is just going to be lost in calculations with generic chunks of atmosphere. thats just great. you can&#39;t get enough detailed measurements at the kilometer scale so you parameterize until you get a resulting number you consider accurate.<br /><br /><br />26 minutes. at least hossenfelder said it is ironic that the science is said to settled if you admit to the uncertainties of the models and ask for more supercomputers to deal with the problem.<br /><br /><br />28 minutes. Palmer has the cheek to talk about the disasters hidden in the tails in the models. like what happens when the temperature and humidity in your country is so high sweating won&#39;t cool you off. idiot! <br /><br /><br />33 minutes. full alarmist mode. &quot;there will be a tipping point that can&#39;t be reversed&quot;. but he did catch his own contradiction on CO2 . he said a future tech that can roll back carbon dioxide to early times won&#39;t do any good once you cross the tipping point. really? so in earth&#39;s long long history there must have never been a CO2 tipping point because climate keeps changing. never been a time when the earth was too hot to cool off.

Alone the years from 1910 to 1940, with the same rate of warming as now, but without the same emissions, already describe that the ipcc has no meaning whatsoever. Hell, they are not even accepting their own modells after 30 years, the one that meets the observations best is the one called "INMCN4", it uses a CO2 forcing of x4, at such a low sensitivity a seperation from other natural factors is less possible, if it ever was.

But when I trained as a scientist before post normal science arrived we were taught that correlation is not causation and the IPCC has yet to explain the cooling between 1942 and 1970 as atmospheric CO2 levels increased or the similar rates of warming from 1910 to 1942 and 1972 to 1998 with different rates of increase in atmospheric CO2.

Add to this that most of the land area did not have adequate coverage until after 1945 and Africa and A America still do not the same applies to the land area values. Finally using krieging to correct temperatures over area is nonsense when one considers that on any one measurement site the surface temperature depends on an algorithm involving some 28 factors including soil type, pore space, infiltration rate, heat capacity, surface roughness, wind speed etc etc . In agriculture we use Class A Pan Evaporation units to arrive at a standard measuring method that gives the true warming effect and these units do not agree with the IPCC temperature trend, in fact they do not show any trend except where there have been changes in wind speed. The idea that science is being used to produce the IPCC claims as Palmer says is not supportable. He states that &quot;we still have some way to go to understand the climate&quot; In this he is correct we have hardly started as this real scientist states:<br /><a href="https://youtu.be/KaUmDZEAhbE">https://youtu.be/KaUmDZEAhbE</a>	UC5UwyHs6XNxGyhAJxIoS3sQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5UwyHs6XNxGyhAJxIoS3sQ	0

I was talking to potholer54 in person, it was about the hockeystick, sadly after a short discussion others jumped in and he stopped talking to me. With the acidification one has to understand the magnitude. The oceans hold 40 times more CO2 then the atmosphere, the ammounts to make it measurably less alkaline are beyond any human emissions. Furthermore since we are in an ice age, the oceans are already holding a lot of CO2, they do this in every ice age and were capable to absorb ammounts from ~5000ppm in the ordovician to ~1500ppm in our cenozoic age (now). This was never a problem to marine life. However, i agree that the we humans add CO2 at an extreme rate, so no one can deny that we are doing an experiment with earth. Nasa reported that CO2 caused a greening of earth in the last 3 decades, imo this is the field which we should focus more on, the flora.

But, as little as I know, ocean acidification seems to be of significant consequence, the ocean acting as a plausible buffer that lets the planet resist a more drastic change in temperature. Dismissing this factor seems wrong to me, especially since any buffer does have an eventual limit. In any case, I am at the limit here in the knowledge I have and the time I can spare. I can direct you to potholer54's YouTube channel, so may be you can have a more valuable discussion. I am open to any arguments against the significance of ocean acidification, I'll read it and consider it privately, but this will be my last reply. Thanks.

I mentioned that Palmer himself seems to wonder why these different groups, doing their models with their formuli, do not compare the models "in a stochastic manner". Human contribution can not be estimated at all, just because the trend is impressively continous, with the same rate that already happened from 1910 to 1940 (0,5°C in 3 decades), without the majoriy of CO2 emissions. The trend is steady, the warming is not accelerating while the CO2 is dramaticly increasing. Trends are not "clear in every Model", the trend is WRITTEN by earth itself. https://images.app.goo.gl/MWuEkWCZ3dunJLuZA This is so obvious that one can only shake ones head, how it is even possible that so many buy in the alarmism. The IPCC has not come one step further then 30 years ago. One of the lowest models is the one called "INMCN4", it meets the OBSERVATIONS pretty good and it neglects the greenhouse effect, using a a factor of x4. So the ippc could advance, accepting their very own models, declaring that thankfully it is not 3°C, let alone 4,5°C, but they don´t, instead they keep alarming, evading to "acidification" and wild tipping points. There will never be "perfection" and with 1,5°C it becomes almost impossible to seperate CO2 from other natural forcings. If CO2 was as strong as apprehended, like 3°C, then we would have strong evidence for the human impact, luckily this did not come true and with that the ipcc has no expresivness whatsoever. The dilemma of the climate uncertainty relation, if you will.	UCvnxpmGdSc_Q3-kvoenwuRQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvnxpmGdSc_Q3-kvoenwuRQ	1	UgyADNy7rz-xc_opSCR4AaABAg	Rohit Roy

Developing models at necessary resolution for cloud cover is an enormous task, and suggests a lack of data - an expensive proposition since perfect data would mean satellites all over the globe. Human contribution can be estimated based on the trends, regardless of what model is used, and trends are clear in every model. A scientist's duty is to pursue perfection, and then question it once achieved. For other rational actors acting on imperfect data, the next obvious steps would be to mitigate estimated damage, while funding better predictions.

The core question is how much is mankind contributing to the warming, in other words: How high is the climate CO2 sensitivity. If you listen closely you will find many questions that even Palmer stumbles upon, for example the question why the modells are not compared with each other, to find out why one modell is less acurate the the other. Which should be the most obvious next step.	UCvnxpmGdSc_Q3-kvoenwuRQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvnxpmGdSc_Q3-kvoenwuRQ	1	UgyADNy7rz-xc_opSCR4AaABAg	Rohit Roy

It&#39;s obvious that radiational cooling dramatically overwhelms CO2 heat trapping. However, if clouds form, the temperature warms after sunset proving that water and clouds are potent GHG&#39;s and CO2 is irrelevant and insignificant GHG.

Where do you get that will change to change close to 100kyears? When speaking in terms of physical laws, there is a stifling effect of rising CO2 levels increasing global temperatures. As temperatures rise, even a little bit, the air is able to hold more moisture in it, and this change causes more turbulence which causes more clouds. Since the absorption of heat to this planet is greatest over the deep dark oceans and clouds reflect the most; the 2 buffer most of the rising CO2 temperature increase models predict. Then you have that rising sea levels from the last glacial period (technically it is not confirmed that we are out of the ice age) will reach a tipping point and shutdown the thermohalid conveyor belt pushing warm equatorial waters to the north pole. Then because of higher CO2 levels, we will avoid another glacial period, which I think is a better occurrence.

She was referring to a proper uncertainty calculation derived from the math underlying the model. Par for the course in an undergrad physics lab, but apparently not for climate scientists.

For example, poverty was never as low as today. And statistics tell us that – thanks to intelligent adaptation policies – the number of deaths from natural disasters has sharply decreased.<br /><br />There is no planetary emergency, climate or otherwise. The climate crisis only exists in computer models. Yes we can, and will, continue to strive to do better for all people, on multiple fronts — including understanding climate and knowing how to adapt to changes.<br /><br />One dire consequence of current model-induced panic is that we are abandoning key elements of our successful, low-cost and reliable energy systems. These are the basis for the quality and duration of human lives! The energy erosion will inevitably result in economic decline and increased poverty, particularly in non-OECD countries.<br /><br />Therefore, the so-called ‘climate mitigation’ is an irresponsible policy. The fundament of social and economic development is adaptation to the climate evolution.<br /><br />Despite heated political rhetoric, we urge all world leaders to accept the reality that there is no climate emergency. There is ample time to use scientific advances to continue improving our society. Meanwhile, we should go for adaptation; it works whatever the causes are.<br /><br />We also invite you to organize with us a constructive, open meeting between world-class scientists on both sides of the climate debate. Such an event complies with the sound and ancient principle that all pertinent parties should be fully heard: Audiatur et altera pars.<br /><br />Letter to the WEF as pdf<br /><br />Yours sincerely, ambassadors of CLINTEL,<br /><br />Nobel Laureate Professor Ivar Giaever, Norway<br />Professor Guus Berkhout, The Netherlands<br />Professor Reynald Du Berger, French speaking Canada<br />John Droz jr, USA<br />Terry Dunleavy, New Zealand<br />Viv Forbes, Australia<br />Professor Jeffrey Foss, English speaking Canada<br />Jens Morton, Hansen Denmark<br />Morten Jødal, Norway<br />Professor Demetris Koutsoyiannes, Greece<br />Rob Lemeire, Dutch speaking Belgium<br />Professor Richard Lindzen, USA<br />Dr. Thiago Maia, Brazil<br />Dr. Henri A.

Exactly why do we think that humans have the ability to control the Earth when time and again the Earth demonstrates we are powerless to act against nature. Predictions are precisely that, just a few possibilities out of countless trillions of alternatives. Humans are a relatively small contributor to global CO2 emissions compared to volcanic eruptions, forest fires, or even termites! Reducing waste and emissions is good because it generally results in increases of efficiency, but who benefits from totally reorganising our established industries? Over population is the problem, not climate change.	UCjFcm9uMpvt7SdfhAofZPQQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjFcm9uMpvt7SdfhAofZPQQ	0

Scientists, all being specialists focused on their field of research, were slow to correlate and communicate. So the prime story of CO2 means more energy in the system in the oceans and near the surface means more moisture in the atmospheric and more circulation particularly in the equatorial zone. That circulation increase drives much of the change in climate by changing how the atmospheric overturning interacts with the Earth surface ie where the high and low pressure systems occur and with what airflow strengths. The real surprise was the rate of decay of the Arctic cold box and the way that failure is allowing massive disruption in the Northern Hemisphere circulation patterns. What we are really needing next are vertical sections through atmospheric data of <a href="http://earth.nullschool.net/">earth.nullschool.net</a> so that we can see more clearly the changes and connections with the overturning rates.

Greenhouse gasses? or some other molecules that only acts one way. (I think it was just a small mistake and he meant reflect IR back to earth as that is the whole (false in my opinion) hypothesis on &quot;&quot;greenhouse gasses&quot;&quot;<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fkCo_trbT8&amp;t=10m30s">10:30</a> - yes the trends we have seen are associated with humans releasing of CO2 it does not mean causation. 0.0008 of the total air or about 64 particles of 80,000 other are manmade CO2.<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fkCo_trbT8&amp;t=12m43s">12:43</a> while I don&#39;t agree at this point CO2 is the main driver of the modern warm period, I agree Tim says we have to get models bias free. Tony Heller&#39;s site identifies some of these biases and contradictions via the media. It&#39;s not on to weaponize and hijack science in this way for financial or political gain. The sociological effect is It&#39;s a form of apophenia.<br /><br />I remain a sceptic that a 0.001%human contribution is driving the current warm period since the warming actually started way before industrialisation AND there have been several times in the past where CO2 has been 100 times denser at 4-5000PPM with no driving effect on temperature then either.<br /><a href="https://www.climate4you.com/">https://www.climate4you.com</a> click start here and play spot the difference with adjustments to the data sets (almost always warming the present and cooling the past) The data is actual and sources are quoted.<br /><br />Ice core CO2 data is monotonic there are papers published that show 400PPM from plant stomata data. Satellite data is problematic for sea level rises and as seen from inaccurate orbital altitudes producing junk data.<br />The science of CO2 IS in question as a greenhouse gas:<br /><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324599511_Thermal_Enhancement_on_Planetary_Bodies_and_the_Relevance_of_the_Molar_Mass_Version_of_the_Ideal_Gas_Law_to_the_Null_Hypothesis_of_Climate_Change">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324599511_Thermal_Enhancement_on_Planetary_Bodies_and_the_Relevance_of_the_Molar_Mass_Version_of_the_Ideal_Gas_Law_to_the_Null_Hypothesis_of_Climate_Change</a><br /><br /><br />Using the molar mass version of the ideal Gas law accurately calculates the temperature of several our planets. This includes Venus with 96.5% Co2. The paper explains the limitation of the ideal gas law but points out how CO2 can NOT be the driving factor. It also explains 15 cosmic cycles that affect the earth and not just 2 the IPCC use (remember they exist to report human induced changes so of course they are impartial (wink wink) <br /><br />Here is a paper showing a more recent phase relationship of CO2 and temperature.

There are also global forces that are just waiting to destroy the sovereignty of western nations, dismantle the borders and force mass people movement by using climate change alarmism as a weapon against its own citizens.<br /><br />The end result may well be the introduction of totalitarian socialistic order where the energy use is taxed and used to control all aspects of the life decisions of ordinary citizens through draconian energy allocation methods per person.<br /><br />You scientists who are creating this climate alarmism (total madness in my view) is not only energising 16 year old girls world famous Nobel prize winning climate change activists, mass demonstration by XR and other activist groups but now governments, the media and those with vested interests in the renewable energy sector are interpreting every extreme weather event as climate change.<br />I would have thought that climate is define (Wiesbaden during 1934) as the statistical record of weather observations over a period of 30 years (minimum).<br />Howe can it be then that every since weather event is now called climate change. Even if the climate statistics are interpreted as an average over a sliding 30 year window that ends at the current date, what climate trend would then be observed? My guess would be the result would be quite unremarkable compared with the climate records of the past. There the weather variability experienced over recent decades are not unprecedented according to many reputable scientists. I think that we should make that point very clear to the policy makers.<br /><br />I just hope that you scientists have thought through what you are doing and the panic that you are creating. Now we are in a situation where trillions of dollars are wasted on PV solar and wind when any engineer (who has not be purchased by money) knows that these sources will never provide the energy that 8+ billion people need. Further the environmental damage of these technology (not to mention EVs) is enormous. This is all caused by scientist who are spreading the climate religion suggesting that the end of the world is near. For starters why don&#39;t you correct what Al Gore is saying or check with professor Tim Ball about the validity of the hockey stick graph.<br /><br />Let&#39;s talk about the science.<br /><br />Most scientist do agree that the average global temperature has risen by about 1 degree C and SOME OF THIS may have been caused by anthropogenic use of fossil fuels. However, during the early 19th Century there were three CO2 molecules out of 10,000 and this has now increased to 4 out of 10,000. Assuming that all CO2 molecules are equal in terms of greenhouse effect, had humans not existed on earth, how do you know that at least some of the temperature rise may have been by virtue of the natural three existing CO2 molecules? <br />It should also be noted that the temperature rise due to increasing CO2 concentration is logarithmic which means that if more CO2 is added the temperature rise will have a non-linear effect the greenhouse effect because much of the &#39;warming&#39; has already occurred due to CO2 being 400 ppm. Of course the climate models would also need to include water vapour because this is just as effective as CO2 and there is much more of it in the atmosphere. And as you mentioned in the video, the clouds are also important to get right. One of Al Gore&#39;s books most of the clouds on the picture of the earth from space have been photoshopped out presumably to give the impression that only CO2 is responsible for the greenhouse effect. Further the cyclones that have been included in the northern and southern hemisphere are twisting the wrong way not to mention one cyclone has been added to the equator - really? Why don&#39;t you call out this blatant manipulation of the facts. Professor William Happer knows the person in NASA to gave the picture to Al Gore for his book.<br /><br />You may not like the proposition that is CO2 is essential to all life on earth and it is the food for plants and accelerated greening of the earth. <br /><br />In other words, there are benefits that are totally ignored in terms of food production and greening of areas of the earth that have been damaged by human activity. <br /><br />It is wrong to vilify CO2 as a pollutant and as something to be avoided. Not one single person has died because of 400 ppm CO2 but millions are dying because of other harmful pollutants that are pushed into the atmosphere - why don&#39;t you tell this to the politicians and the media?<br /><br />The global average temperature has risen 1 degree C and if the CO2 level is increased to 800 ppm, one additional degree may be added (noting the logarithmic nature of absorption), which means that, in the wort case, 2 degree C warming may occur by the end of 2100. However this is quite unlikely considering that we have time to develop our nuclear energy options and other technology to complement the use of fossil fuel with other energy sources.<br /><br />The question is not whether we have somewhat more CO2 in the atmosphere because of anthropogenic activity AND that the global average temperature will rise slightly because none of this has been proven to be harmful to human life on earth. In fact, if the difference in temperate between the poles and the equator is slightly less, there is a good chance that weather extremes will also be slightly less and not more. And, in fact, this is the case looking at the ACTUAL DATA (not the models) of the number of extreme weather events over the past few decades compared with the past.<br />You also corrected the interviewee in the recorded data saying that this is the &#39;interpretation of the recorded data&#39; and to this many observers are saying that the actual recorded data has often been fiddled with so that GW appears to be much worse that what is actually the case. I note that you are using temperature graphs that show the anomaly of the temperature change, try and make the Y axis as a proper actual temperature scale (0 - 20 degrees C say) and see what the GW trend over the past few decades looks like. You might even find that the variation that we are experiencing is within the range of natural variations that has occurred during the earth&#39;s history.<br /><br />Finally, what really counts is: 1) is the CO2 level of 400+ ppm harmful to humans? The answer is no. 2) is a 2 degree C rise harmful to humans? Again the answer is likely to be no because humans have lived through such temperatures before and besides warmer weather is always better than colder weather.

He should also study the history of economic modelling in the last eighty years. The lesson learnt there are also applicable to climate models. Palmer doesn't seem to be aware that he and his colleagues are making some of the same mistakes. He is far too optimistic that using about extra computer power and smaller grids will give better results in the future.

In the closer past the ice cores show CO2 following temperature, the pressumed feedback forcing is nowhere evidenced after the onset of an interglacial. In our near past we had the decades of 1910 till 1940 demonstrating a natural trend after a little ice age, without the vast human CO2 emissions. This trend is repeated today and warming is not accelerating, again the evidence for CO2 having any thermal effect is faslified, not evidenced. Observing the same trend like 1910 - 1940 indicates that what is happening now is normal and evidenced by a comparable warm- cold rythm in the past, dominated by ocean rhythm on scales up to millenials. The evidence for GHG being the reson for temperature change does not describe how much CO2 is responsible. This is why the sensitivity is still estimated and not calculated after including all laws from Arhenius to Boltzmann (1,5°C to 4,5°C with a doubling). Proving the GHG effect as a whole, does not proof the overall share of added CO2 in a thermal manner, which leads to theories of saturation and opacity of the atmosphere and apossibly a new look at the black body radiation reults and the cooling mechanism of the stratosphere. Since the Faint Sun Paradox is not solved, warming in itself is not explained yet. Too many unknowns no matter how angry you are. The IPCC still fails to seperate CO2 from all other effects and the idea that a doubling of CO2 from 0,04% to 0,08% will increse the global temperature by 1,5°C, let alone 3°C, is idiotic if you consider CO2 concentrations from the precambrian on: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1OreyX0-fw The decline in CO2 is remarkable, already the concentration since the cambrian with up to 6000 ppm was extremly low and the further reduction to 2000 ppm in the early mesozoic, to the kaneozoicum of todays 300 ppm without ever showing any signs to have an influence on temperature. While during Snowball Earth effects CO2 was up to 90,000 ppm.	UCvnxpmGdSc_Q3-kvoenwuRQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvnxpmGdSc_Q3-kvoenwuRQ	1	UgwuedmDvlOaAQek0th4AaABAg	grindupBaker

UgwPgIbNWS1hozebT8R4AaABAg	0	0	2020-01-01 14:46:21	grindupBaker	<b>*</b> PART 1 OF 3 <b>*</b> <br />This is how the so-called &quot;greenhouse effect&quot; in Earth&#39;s troposphere causes warming. The so-called &quot;greenhouse effect&quot; effect is nothing at all like the effect that warms a greenhouse. A vast &quot;shimmer&quot; of transverse electromagnetic radiation (TER) in the long-wave band (LWR) is caused by molecules of water vapour (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (NO2) and some other gases in the troposphere due to their collisions (averaging 2,700,000,000 collisions / second) with other molecules, which are almost always going to be nitrogen (N2) or oxygen (O2) because they are almost all of the gas quantity in the troposphere. The H2O, CO2, CH4, NO2 and some other gases are being called &quot;greenhouse gases (GHGs)&quot; because the overall effect (not just this part) ends up causing warming of Earth&#39;s troposphere. All except H2O are called &quot;well-mixed greenhouse gases&quot; because their boiling and freezing points are so low that they don&#39;t condense or freeze in the troposphere, not even near the top, so they get spread out well mixed around Earth and well mixed vertically in the troposphere. The well-mixed GHGs now punch above their weight compared with water vapour (H2O) because the upper half of the troposphere is so cold that almost all H2O forms on dust/salt particles in liquid or solid form there rather than being a GHG but the others remain as GHGs. The lowest quarter or so of the troposphere where it&#39;s warmer and water vapour (H2O) is king is already highly &quot;saturated&quot; without much additional &quot;enhanced greenhouse effect&quot; possible (still, H2O has such a broad absorption band that it still manages to match CO2 pretty much exactly 1:1 net as a 100% +ve feedback). <br />------------------ <br />The GHG molecules don&#39;t emit a photon (LWR unit) of LWR when they collide and they don&#39;t later get to emit a photon of LWR after every collision, only after a few of them (note 1). What happens is that a collision might cause a GHG molecule to vibrate in a certain way (so with a certain energy) of which the GHG molecule has the capability of any one of a selection (called its &quot;vibrational modes&quot;). GHG molecules with more vibrational modes are more powerful GHGs because they have a broader absorption/emission band. The GHG molecule now has &quot;molecular vibrational energy (MVE)&quot; if the collision did cause it to vibrate. Energy cannot be created without destroying matter and matter doesn&#39;t get destroyed by this. What happens is that one or both of the two molecules slows down such that the total &quot;molecular translational energy (MTE)&quot;, aka &quot;molecular kinetic energy&quot;, aka &quot;heat&quot;, is reduced by precisely the same amount as the MVE that the GHG molecule acquired, so (m1*v1**2 + m2*v2**2)/2 after collision is less than (m1*v1**2 + m2*v2**2)/2 before collision because either v1 or v2 or both was reduced, thus obeying the Law Of Conservation Of Energy. Effectively, the temperature of the 2 colliding molecules was reduced by an energy amount equaling the MVE that the GHG molecule acquired, what happened was energy transmutation from one form to another. When this vibrating GHG molecule hits another molecule it loses its vibration (note 1) and one or both of the two molecules speeds up such that the total MTE, aka &quot;heat&quot;, is increased by precisely the same amount as the MVE that the GHG molecule lost. So it just moved speed/heat from one N2 or O2 (almost always) molecule to another. However, ==here we go==, very occasionally/rarely and not very often at all compared with the 2,700,000,000 collisions / second that happen to this GHG molecule the GHG molecule with MVE will spontaneously emit a photon of LWR and lose its MVE. Now it has converted one-photon&#39;s-worth of &quot;heat&quot; in the troposphere to one photon of LWR. It has cooled the troposphere by one-photon&#39;s-worth of &quot;heat&quot; (one molecule is now in a global Mini Ice Age ?). This &quot;relaxation time&quot; of the covalent bond harmonic motion (with a photon emitted) happens over 10ths of one second (a very long time indeed). <br />------------------ <br />LWR is also radiated from the surfaces of liquids &amp; solids such as the surface of the ocean, the surfaces of water droplets in spray above the ocean, the surfaces of water droplets in clouds, the surfaces of any water droplets at all, the land surface, the surfaces of trees &amp; grass, the skins of animals, the surfaces of dust, salt, volcanic ash, any ash and any surface whatsoever on the ocean or land or in the troposphere. Except for 10% of this LWR whose photons happen to have wave-lengths in a band called &quot;the atmospheric window&quot; this LWR goes into the vast &quot;shimmer&quot; of LWR in the troposphere with a distribution of energy quantity at each wave-length in the LWR band that you&#39;ve all seen hundreds of plots of all over the place. <br />------------------ <br />GHG molecules also absorb LWR provided that the photon&#39;s energy (which is its wave-length) perfectly matches one of that GHG molecule&#39;s MVE mode energies and the photon goes through (or tries to go through) the area of the GHG molecule that absorbs that wave-length (obvious example, CO2 isn&#39;t at all fussy what part of its molecule a photon of wave-length 15.00 microns goes through, it&#39;ll swallow it and vibrate). Obviously, a GHG molecule neither knows nor cares whether a photon of a certain wave-length trying to go through it was emitted by the surface of the ocean, the surfaces of water droplets in spray above the ocean, the surfaces of water droplets in clouds, the surfaces of any water droplets at all, the land surface, the surfaces of trees &amp; grass, the skins of animals, the surfaces of dust, salt, volcanic ash, any ash and any surface whatsoever on the ocean or land or in the troposphere, or emitted by another GHG molecule (H2O, CO2, CH4, NO2 and any other GHG molecule) because all photons of the same wave-length are the same. A GHG molecule with MVE that it got by absorbing LWR can, of course, ==here we go again==, very occasionally/rarely and not very often at all compared with the 2,700,000,000 collisions / second that happen to this GHG molecule (note 2) spontaneously emit a photon of LWR and lose its MVE. In this case the GHG molecule transmuted LWR back to LWR, it transmuted a photon to an identical photon, so it did nothing at all other than change the direction in which the photon is going. This is the cartoon that scientists show the public because it&#39;s a simple analog that Earth tried to cool itself to space and failed, but since there are 2,700,000,000 collisions / second there&#39;s just about a bat&#39;s chance in hell that the GHG molecule will spontaneously emit a photon of LWR and lose its MVE before it collides and loses its MVE (note 1). The coal/oil shills use the highly-incorrect nature of this ludicrously-over-simplified cartoon to &quot;disprove&quot; the physics theory but it isn&#39;t the physics theory that&#39;s incorrect, it&#39;s the cartoon that&#39;s incorrect. It doesn&#39;t describe the physics theory hardly at all as I&#39;ve explained in detail above. This is why I dislike this cartoon. When a vibrating GHG molecule hits another molecule it loses its vibration (note 1) and one or both of the two molecules speeds up. This means that &quot;heat&quot; increased, what happened was energy transmutation from one form to another, energy transmutation from LWR to &quot;heat&quot; with MVE as the intermediary step.

Ugy3_eav0yXSHAP-2Mp4AaABAg	2	0	2020-01-01 14:45:46	grindupBaker	<b>*</b> PART 2 OF 3 <b>*</b> <br />Now the so-called &quot;enhanced greenhouse effect&quot; explanation that I think is clearest, obvious and difficult to challenge by mis-direction disinformation and subterfuge per the memes concocted by the coal/oil shills. 17% of the LWR that Earth sends to space is emitted by the ocean or land surface because the photons are in a wave-length band called &quot;the atmospheric window&quot; that doesn&#39;t get absorbed by the GHGs. It&#39;s my understanding that this will narrow slightly with increased GHGs, but this isn&#39;t the prime &quot;enhanced greenhouse effect&quot; and I&#39;m not addressing any additional warming it might cause. 83% of the LWR that Earth sends to space is emitted by the GHG molecules in the troposphere, tropopause and stratosphere (note 2). This 83% of the LWR is the part that gets reduced by increased tropospheric GHGs and causes an energy imbalance with insufficient energy going out, which causes global warming, ocean heating and ice fusion, which causes climate change, which causes a variety of nuisances that I haven&#39;t studied. <br />------------------ <br />The troposphere has an upper and a lower surface. The upper surface is the top of the troposphere (the tropopause) and the lower surface is the surface of the ocean or land. LWR produced in the troposphere that reaches the lower surface will warm that surface so it stays in Earth&#39;s ecosphere but LWR produced in the troposphere that reaches the upper surface has a good chance to make it through the increasingly-thin tropopause, stratosphere and the ultra-thin extended atmosphere to space and be energy lost to Earth&#39;s ecosphere, thus cooling it. LWR reaching the upper/lower surfaces was produced by GHG molecules, the surfaces of water droplets and the surfaces of solid particles (sea salt, ash, dust) throughout the troposphere sending photons upwards/downwards as described in detail earlier. <br />- There is an average altitude in the troposphere of the LWR quantity that reaches space. If you could float at this altitude and watch/count photons with special eye balls and brain you&#39;d see 50% of those photons that reach space are heading up from below you. If you counted it at 48% then you&#39;d need to float upward to get more of the LWR photon production below you. If you counted it at 52% then you&#39;d need to float downward to get more of the LWR photon production above you. This is obvious. When you float to the place where 50.0000000% of those photons that reach space are heading up from below you then you are at the average altitude in the troposphere of the LWR quantity that reaches space. <br />- There is an average altitude in the troposphere of the LWR quantity that reaches the surface of the ocean or land. You could float and find that the same way as the preceding. <br />These 2 altitudes in the troposphere are approximately for illustration only and as a global average (I&#39;m not quantifying the so-called &quot;enhanced greenhouse effect&quot; in this comment, only describing its operation accurately): <br />---- average --- ---- average global ---- <br />---- altitude --- ---- temperature ---- <br />6,600 metres -29.75 degrees 50% of the &quot;shimmer cloud&quot; of LWR photons that will make it to the tropopause are emitted by GHG molecules and the surfaces of cloud droplets and atmospheric particles below this altitude. <br />1,650 metres 3.7 degrees 50% of the &quot;shimmer cloud&quot; of LWR photons that will make it to the surface of the ocean or land are emitted by GHG molecules and the surfaces of cloud droplets and atmospheric particles below this altitude. <br />These values are approximate. They are to demonstrate how the so-called &quot;enhanced greenhouse effect&quot; works, not to provide quantities. They are approximately correct though. They are based on a global average ~12,000 metres height of the troposphere but it varies geographically from 9,000 to 16,000 metres. <br />--------------- <br />If tropospheric GHGs are increased then 2 changes occur per my explanations above since the start of my comment: <br />1) More LWR than before is produced by the GHGs, and <br />2) More LWR than before is absorbed by the GHGs because the LWR photons have to make it through more GHG molecules that might absorb them before they can reach their goal of going up past the top of the troposphere or going down past the bottom of the troposphere and being absorbed into the ocean or land. <br />Note that I have not included &quot;(3) The LWR photons emitted by the surface of the ocean and land have to make it through more GHG molecules that might absorb them before they can reach space&quot; because I&#39;m dealing with the 83% of the LWR reaching space that&#39;s created by GHG molecules in the troposphere obtaining, then losing, MVE with spontaneous photon emission caused. I&#39;m not dealing with the 17% of the LWR in a wave-length band called &quot;the atmospheric window&quot; that gets directly to space after being emitted by the surface of the ocean and land. If that 17% is reduced by increased tropospheric GHGs (I&#39;m not sure) then that&#39;s an additional, unrelated, means of the so-called &quot;enhanced greenhouse effect&quot; (there&#39;s no particular reason why there has to be only one mechanism). <br />--------------- <br />The result of combined effects/changes (1), (2) above is that the average altitude in the troposphere of the LWR quantity that reaches the top of the troposphere gets higher, so perhaps it raises from the 6,600 metres to 6,700 metres (as an example). Also, the LWR quantity is reduced slightly (the so-called &quot;enhanced greenhouse effect&quot;) for reason of the tropospheric temperature lapse rate explained below. <br />--------------- <br />Likewise, identically, the average altitude in the troposphere of the LWR quantity that reaches the surface of the ocean or land gets lower, so perhaps it lowers from the 1,650 metres to 1,550 metres (obviously, it depends on the change quantity. I just showed a random example) because it has to get past more GHG molecules that might absorb the photon. <br />--------------- <br />In either case GHG photons were trying to reach their goal of the top or bottom of the troposphere but now there are more GHGs in the way so it needs, == on average ==, to be a bit closer to make it. So that&#39;s why the &quot;cloud&quot; of LWR that will reach the top is a higher cloud than before and the &quot;cloud&quot; of LWR that will reach the bottom (ocean or land) is a lower cloud than before <br />--------------- <br />The tropospheric temperature lapse rate is required to cause the so-called &quot;enhanced greenhouse effect&quot;. <br />The average altitude for LWR to space got higher (6,600 metres ---&gt; 6,700 metres in my example) which means LWR to space is from colder (slower) molecules on average because tropospheric temperature decreases with altitude and LWR to space is from higher-up-than-before molecules on average, so there are fewer GHG molecular collisions / second which leads to less MVE which leads to less LWR production. The quantity of LWR energy (power flux) provided by a mass of gas is proportional to its temperature(Kelvin)**4 (to the fourth power) so, as explained in detail above, the increasing of tropospheric GHGs ==must== cause less LWR than before to be passing upwards through the top of the troposphere. <br />That&#39;s the upper end of how the so-called &quot;enhanced greenhouse effect&quot; works.

In the end you got nothing, already the precambrian with the FaintSunParadox tells us that something is missing, hence the term "paradox". Im modern times we have 1910 till 1945 with a compareable warming to our decades and you can not exactly explain why and you can not say that this warming already occured without a cooling stratosphere. It is the same old story of "We can not explain warming with anything else except ghg" You should try to take an advocat diavoli position and realize that CO2 makes no sense as a driver at any given time in earth history. Your pseudo complicated calculations will all end in a climate-uncertainty problem, this is why after 30 years the IPCC has not advanced a single step, it is still 1,5° up to 4,5°, a high uncertainty while the natural trend and the false modells are ignored: The 1910-1940s trend after the little ice age is put aside just like the hiatus with arguments like "Well something else happened" This "something else" already is enough to question any explanationary power. Most likely Judith Curry is right, there is way too many uncertainties but it is probably long term ocean cycles that regulate our climate dominantly and this explains why temperatures do not react yet to a declining sun iradiance, it is the inertness of the system with the oceans as a battery.

The quantity of LWR energy (power flux) provided by a mass of gas is proportional to its temperature(Kelvin)**4 (to the fourth power) so, as explained in detail above, the increasing of tropospheric GHGs ==must== cause more LWR than before to be passing downwards to the surface of the ocean and land. This latter is called &quot;downwelling LWR radiation at the surface&quot; and I&#39;ve explained why it must increase and this must, of course, warm the land and ocean surface. <br />That&#39;s the lower end of how the so-called &quot;enhanced greenhouse effect&quot; works. <br />--------- <br />Note 1: I haven&#39;t yet found the collision MVE production &amp; destruction spectra so I don&#39;t know what %age make MVE and what %age destroy MVE. I looked a few hours 4 years ago but couldn&#39;t find it (not for free anyway). It makes no difference to the description of the mechanism above but it would be needed to confirm the quantity of effect for doubling CO2. <br />Note 2: Removed because I&#39;ve gotten confirmation. <br />Note 3: 80% of Earth&#39;s atmosphere is in the troposphere (the top of which is 16 km in the tropics and 9 km in the polar regions, averaging ~12,000 metres). The &quot;greenhouse effect&quot; warming can only happen in Earth&#39;s troposphere, there&#39;s no effect in Earth&#39;s tropopause and the effect is &quot;backwards&quot; in Earth&#39;s stratosphere with =increased= stratospheric GHG gases causing =cooling= of the stratosphere because the stratospheric temperature lapse rate has temperature increasing with altitude (that&#39;s how it&#39;s known with total certainty that it&#39;s increased &quot;greenhouse gases (GHGs)&quot; doing the global warming for the last several decades). Since there&#39;s no temperature lapse rate in the tropopause then any change in the quantity/type of GHGs in the tropopause cannot have any warming or cooling effect on the tropopause or the entire atmosphere, ocean or land. No effect at all. If you follow my description of the effect above for the troposphere but apply it to the tropopause then you&#39;ll clearly see that any change in the quantity/type of GHGs in the tropopause cannot have any warming or cooling effect That&#39;s the reality. The increasing GHGs in the stratosphere are a slight -ve feedback to global warming because downwelling LWR radiation from the stratosphere decreases with increased GHGs, but it&#39;s a very slight -ve feedback because only 6.3% of the well-mixed GHGs (and all molecules) are above the tropopause and they are initially colder than the average of the troposphere so they make even less LWR than the 6.3% factor. By the time the stratosphere warms more than the average of the troposphere there&#39;s only 0.4% of Earth&#39;s atmosphere&#39;s molecules above, negligible. <br />Note 4: FTIR power flux vs wave-length spectra recorded by the instrument on a satellite show which wave-lengths of LWR heading to space past the satellite came from the surface of the ocean and land and which wave-lengths came, on average, from the GHG molecules and surfaces of solid particles and water droplets in the atmosphere. From this atmospheric physicists have calculated the 83% of the LWR that Earth sends to space that is emitted by the atmosphere rather than by the surface of the ocean and land. Also, the MODTRAN tool on the internet can be used to play with a theoretical calculation of the FTIR power flux vs wave-length spectra by adjusting GHGs.

Looks like there is none, we will probably land at 1,3°C with a doubling of CO2 around 2050. Looks like something is missing, the IPCC refuses to interpretate their very own modells compared to the observations. In other words: Earth is doing what she wants, continuing her trend from the early 20th century. You AGW tools just take the wrong aproach. Earth always has a trend towards warming, it is only interrupted by ice ages and these are easy to explain: Sufficient landmasses at the poles like in the ordovician, the carboniferous, permian and cenozoic today with antarctica at the south pole once again. A cooling stratosphere does not mean anything since you have no observerd comparison in the past, you will never be able to seperate CO2 from the rest in its forcing, so just give in and accept what Popper and Ockham are telling you: Obviuosly CO2 does nada fuckwit.

Win	Sabine, a quick suggestion: since the subject of CO2/climate is obviously such a political debate, could you perhaps make a video on a more neutral subject, namely your opinion on LFTR (Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactors)? These modern fission reactors could power our entire globe for thousands of years with close to no radio active waste material, with only a half time of 150 yrs. Would this be the true intermediate solution until <del>and if</del> we harness fusion or perhaps learn how to tap fusion energy directly from the Sun. If done in the format of a video interview you might want to talk to Kirk Sorensen / Sunniva Rose? In my opinion unlimited, copious and clean energy is the way forward. As you know, Germany is currently still heavily reliant on the burning of coal for energy, making electric cars quite polluting after all...I personally can&#39;t see why we wouldn&#39;t switch to Thorium fission in stead, but perhaps you can shed your light??? thanx	UCtKiDIf9OK27p_5oTFlp7WA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtKiDIf9OK27p_5oTFlp7WA	0

Win	Sabine into politics...The IPCC Climate Change initiative is about the socialist pipe dream to scare people into given up their democratic freedoms and pay extra taxes. The climate has always changed and always will. We are coming out of the mini-ice age of the 17th century, so yes it gets warmer. Yes human industrialization has lead to higher co2 emissions. Is there a causal link? Nop. CO2 is a minor greenhouse gas. We know from archeological findings 4000 year ago in Northern Greenland that people lived of AGRICULTURE there, indicating at least 8 degrees warmer climate. Next under receding glaciers in Siberia, alps and Iceland we find remains of rooted tree trunks dating back to the Roman era, indicating at least 4 degrees warmer climate. So now what about the relation between CO2 and temperature dear Prof Palmer? But just look at this poor man&#39;s eyes; ....He does not believe a words he says , and why should we?

An example of why this is the case is the Central Limit Theorem. This says that in sampling random independent processes, the averages converge to the Normal probability distribution with a predicable mean and variation. This is how models are verified. You find, by perturbing your parameters, the results still fall within a predictable distribution. If you perturb the parameters sufficiently then one may get a completely different distribution — these are the tipping points&quot;. <br />------------------ <br />@Lawrence Winkler I&#39;ve just realized that my own simple computer simulations for engineering a few decades ago produced &quot;tipping points&quot; very frequently and I saw the &quot;tipping points&quot; happen 4 times that I recall. Your &quot;perturbing your parameters&quot; jolted my memory. It&#39;s a simple thing, not rocket science or climate science. I&#39;ve written computer simulations to calculate average and maximum wait times for elevators to avoid wasting space by having too many elevators. So the model user can only specify persons arriving in 10 minutes, maybe 550 for an office tower, but arrival is randomized just like it would be in reality which randomization is perturbing your parameters because bods randomly just miss an elevator by 1 second on 1 model run and maybe just barely catch it another time. So we run the model 100 times and obtain 100 results which tells us that the elevators won&#39;t get overwhelmed when persons arrive in random groups and nobody ever waits more than 3 minutes and almost everybody waits 30 seconds. It frequently collapsed like a &quot;tipping point&quot; when the developer tried to remove 1 elevator to save space &amp; cost. I saw it (a sort of &quot;tipping point&quot;) happen 4 times in real life (so not just the model) that I recall: <br />- Toronto Lester B Pearson Airport when the luggage carts ended up like a traffic gridlock <br />- Ryerson College Toronto library elevators (students!) <br />- Scarborough Centennial Hospital Toronto with 1 elevator broken <br />- 10 San Romanoway rental tower Toronto (mums with carriages &amp; groceries) <br />Total collapse in those cases. Have to sit it out for 1 hour until everybody else is gone, or take the stairs.	UCGcEOvg7z8aL9LvTH4QFnWA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGcEOvg7z8aL9LvTH4QFnWA	0

The quantity of LWR energy (power flux) provided by a mass of gas is proportional to its temperature(Kelvin)**4 (to the fourth power) so, as explained in detail above, the increasing of tropospheric GHGs ==must== cause more LWR than before to be passing downwards to the surface of the ocean and land. This latter is called &quot;downwelling LWR radiation at the surface&quot; and I&#39;ve explained why it must increase and this must, of course, warm the land and ocean surface. <br />That&#39;s the lower end of how the so-called &quot;enhanced greenhouse effect&quot; works. <br />--------- <br />Note 1: I haven&#39;t yet found the collision MVE production &amp; destruction spectra so I don&#39;t know what %age make MVE and what %age destroy MVE. I looked a few hours 4 years ago but couldn&#39;t find it (not for free anyway). It makes no difference to the description of the mechanism above but it would be needed to confirm the quantity of effect for doubling CO2. <br />Note 2: I&#39;ve read on the internet that spontaneous emission of a photon of LWR by a GHG molecule with MVE will typically occur after ~1.0 seconds with MVE but I&#39;m not accepting that without some serious fact checking which I haven&#39;t done yet. One photon / second just seems way too minuscule to me. I also need that information to calculate whether mis-calibration method of the STAR MSU/AMSU instrument makes the RSS &amp; UAH TLT temperature O2 proxy analyses analyse a significantly lower total of energy than thermometers measure, or whether the difference is negligible. It makes no difference to the description of the mechanism above. <br />Note 3: 80% of Earth&#39;s atmosphere is in the troposphere (the top of which is 16 km in the tropics and 9 km in the polar regions, averaging ~12,000 metres). The &quot;greenhouse effect&quot; warming can only happen in Earth&#39;s troposphere, there&#39;s no effect in Earth&#39;s tropopause and the effect is &quot;backwards&quot; in Earth&#39;s stratosphere with =increased= stratospheric GHG gases causing =cooling= of the stratosphere because the stratospheric temperature lapse rate has temperature increasing with altitude (that&#39;s how it&#39;s known with total certainty that it&#39;s increased &quot;greenhouse gases (GHGs)&quot; doing the global warming for the last several decades). Since there&#39;s no temperature lapse rate in the tropopause then any change in the quantity/type of GHGs in the tropopause cannot have any warming or cooling effect on the tropopause or the entire atmosphere, ocean or land. No effect at all. If you follow my description of the effect above for the troposphere but apply it to the tropopause then you&#39;ll clearly see that any change in the quantity/type of GHGs in the tropopause cannot have any warming or cooling effect That&#39;s the reality. The increasing GHGs in the stratosphere are a slight -ve feedback to global warming because downwelling LWR radiation from the stratosphere decreases with increased GHGs, but it&#39;s a very slight -ve feedback because only 6.3% of the well-mixed GHGs (and all molecules) are above the tropopause and they are initially colder than the average of the troposphere so they make even less LWR than the 6.3% factor. By the time the stratosphere warms more than the average of the troposphere there&#39;s only 0.4% of Earth&#39;s atmosphere&#39;s molecules above, negligible. <br />Note 4: FTIR power flux vs wave-length spectra recorded by the instrument on a satellite show which wave-lengths of LWR heading to space past the satellite came from the surface of the ocean and land and which wave-lengths came, on average, from the GHG molecules and surfaces of solid particles and water droplets in the atmosphere. From this atmospheric physicists have calculated the 83% of the LWR that Earth sends to space that is emitted by the atmosphere rather than by the surface of the ocean and land. Also, the MODTRAN tool on the internet can be used to play with a theoretical calculation of the FTIR power flux vs wave-length spectra by adjusting GHGs.

It&#39;s my understanding that this will narrow slightly with increased GHGs, but this isn&#39;t the prime &quot;enhanced greenhouse effect&quot; and I&#39;m not addressing any additional warming it might cause. 83% of the LWR that Earth sends to space is emitted by the GHG molecules in the troposphere, tropopause and stratosphere (note 2). This 83% of the LWR is the part that gets reduced by increased tropospheric GHGs and causes an energy imbalance with insufficient energy going out, which causes global warming, ocean heating and ice fusion, which causes climate change, which causes a variety of nuisances that I haven&#39;t studied. <br />------------------ <br />The troposphere has an upper and a lower surface. The upper surface is the top of the troposphere (the tropopause) and the lower surface is the surface of the ocean or land. LWR produced in the troposphere that reaches the lower surface will warm that surface so it stays in Earth&#39;s ecosphere but LWR produced in the troposphere that reaches the upper surface has a good chance to make it through the increasingly-thin tropopause, stratosphere and the ultra-thin extended atmosphere to space and be energy lost to Earth&#39;s ecosphere, thus cooling it. LWR reaching the upper/lower surfaces was produced by GHG molecules, the surfaces of water droplets and the surfaces of solid particles (sea salt, ash, dust) throughout the troposphere sending photons upwards/downwards as described in detail earlier. <br />- There is an average altitude in the troposphere of the LWR quantity that reaches space. If you could float at this altitude and watch/count photons with special eye balls and brain you&#39;d see 50% of those photons that reach space are heading up from below you. If you counted it at 48% then you&#39;d need to float upward to get more of the LWR photon production below you. If you counted it at 52% then you&#39;d need to float downward to get more of the LWR photon production above you. This is obvious. When you float to the place where 50.0000000% of those photons that reach space are heading up from below you then you are at the average altitude in the troposphere of the LWR quantity that reaches space. <br />- There is an average altitude in the troposphere of the LWR quantity that reaches the surface of the ocean or land. You could float and find that the same way as the preceding. <br />These 2 altitudes in the troposphere are approximately for illustration only and as a global average (I&#39;m not quantifying the so-called &quot;enhanced greenhouse effect&quot; in this comment, only describing its operation accurately): <br />---- average --- ---- average global ---- <br />---- altitude --- ---- temperature ---- <br />6,600 metres -29.75 degrees 50% of the &quot;shimmer cloud&quot; of LWR photons that will make it to the tropopause are emitted by GHG molecules and the surfaces of cloud droplets and atmospheric particles below this altitude. <br />1,650 metres 3.7 degrees 50% of the &quot;shimmer cloud&quot; of LWR photons that will make it to the surface of the ocean or land are emitted by GHG molecules and the surfaces of cloud droplets and atmospheric particles below this altitude. <br />These values are approximate. They are to demonstrate how the so-called &quot;enhanced greenhouse effect&quot; works, not to provide quantities. They are approximately correct though. They are based on a global average ~12,000 metres height of the troposphere but it varies geographically from 9,000 to 16,000 metres. <br />--------------- <br />If tropospheric GHGs are increased then 2 changes occur per my explanations above since the start of my comment: <br />1) More LWR than before is produced by the GHGs, and <br />2) More LWR than before is absorbed by the GHGs because the LWR photons have to make it through more GHG molecules that might absorb them before they can reach their goal of going up past the top of the troposphere or going down past the bottom of the troposphere and being absorbed into the ocean or land. <br />Note that I have not included &quot;(3) The LWR photons emitted by the surface of the ocean and land have to make it through more GHG molecules that might absorb them before they can reach space&quot; because I&#39;m dealing with the 83% of the LWR reaching space that&#39;s created by GHG molecules in the troposphere obtaining, then losing, MVE with spontaneous photon emission caused. I&#39;m not dealing with the 17% of the LWR in a wave-length band called &quot;the atmospheric window&quot; that gets directly to space after being emitted by the surface of the ocean and land. If that 17% is reduced by increased tropospheric GHGs (I&#39;m not sure) then that&#39;s an additional, unrelated, means of the so-called &quot;enhanced greenhouse effect&quot; (there&#39;s no particular reason why there has to be only one mechanism). <br />--------------- <br />The result of combined effects/changes (1), (2) above is that the average altitude in the troposphere of the LWR quantity that reaches the top of the troposphere gets higher, so perhaps it raises from the 6,600 metres to 6,700 metres (as an example). Also, the LWR quantity is reduced slightly (the so-called &quot;enhanced greenhouse effect&quot;) for reason of the tropospheric temperature lapse rate explained below. <br />--------------- <br />Likewise, identically, the average altitude in the troposphere of the LWR quantity that reaches the surface of the ocean or land gets lower, so perhaps it lowers from the 1,650 metres to 1,550 metres (obviously, it depends on the change quantity. I just showed a random example) because it has to get past more GHG molecules that might absorb the photon. <br />--------------- <br />In either case GHG photons were trying to reach their goal of the top or bottom of the troposphere but now there are more GHGs in the way so it needs, == on average ==, to be a bit closer to make it. So that&#39;s why the &quot;cloud&quot; of LWR that will reach the top is a higher cloud than before and the &quot;cloud&quot; of LWR that will reach the bottom (ocean or land) is a lower cloud than before <br />--------------- <br />The tropospheric temperature lapse rate is required to cause the so-called &quot;enhanced greenhouse effect&quot;. <br />The average altitude for LWR to space got higher (6,600 metres ---&gt; 6,700 metres in my example) which means LWR to space is from colder (slower) molecules on average because tropospheric temperature decreases with altitude and LWR to space is from higher-up-than-before molecules on average, so there are fewer GHG molecular collisions / second which leads to less MVE which leads to less LWR production. The quantity of LWR energy (power flux) provided by a mass of gas is proportional to its temperature(Kelvin)**4 (to the fourth power) so, as explained in detail above, the increasing of tropospheric GHGs ==must== cause less LWR than before to be passing upwards through the top of the troposphere. <br />That&#39;s the upper end of how the so-called &quot;enhanced greenhouse effect&quot; works.

UgxdbOqt2mM2Rshvlwd4AaABAg	0	0	2019-12-23 16:06:09	grindupBaker	<b>*</b> PART 1 OF 3 <b>*</b> <br />This is how the so-called &quot;greenhouse effect&quot; in Earth&#39;s troposphere causes warming. The so-called &quot;greenhouse effect&quot; effect is nothing at all like the effect that warms a greenhouse. A vast &quot;shimmer&quot; of transverse electromagnetic radiation (TER) in the long-wave band (LWR) is caused by molecules of water vapour (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (NO2) and some other gases in the troposphere due to their collisions (averaging 2,700,000,000 collisions / second) with other molecules, which are almost always going to be nitrogen (N2) or oxygen (O2) because they are almost all of the gas quantity in the troposphere. The H2O, CO2, CH4, NO2 and some other gases are being called &quot;greenhouse gases (GHGs)&quot; because the overall effect (not just this part) ends up causing warming of Earth&#39;s troposphere. All except H2O are called &quot;well-mixed greenhouse gases&quot; because their boiling and freezing points are so low that they don&#39;t condense or freeze in the troposphere, not even near the top, so they get spread out well mixed around Earth and well mixed vertically in the troposphere. The well-mixed GHGs now punch above their weight compared with water vapour (H2O) because the upper half of the troposphere is so cold that almost all H2O forms on dust/salt particles in liquid or solid form there rather than being a GHG but the others remain as GHGs. The lowest quarter or so of the troposphere where it&#39;s warmer and water vapour (H2O) is king is already highly &quot;saturated&quot; without much additional &quot;enhanced greenhouse effect&quot; possible (still, H2O has such a broad absorption band that it still manages to match CO2 pretty much exactly 1:1 net as a 100% +ve feedback). <br />------------------ <br />The GHG molecules don&#39;t emit a photon (LWR unit) of LWR when they collide and they don&#39;t later get to emit a photon of LWR after every collision, only after a few of them (note 1). What happens is that a collision might cause a GHG molecule to vibrate in a certain way (so with a certain energy) of which the GHG molecule has the capability of any one of a selection (called its &quot;vibrational modes&quot;). GHG molecules with more vibrational modes are more powerful GHGs because they have a broader absorption/emission band. The GHG molecule now has &quot;molecular vibrational energy (MVE)&quot; if the collision did cause it to vibrate. Energy cannot be created without destroying matter and matter doesn&#39;t get destroyed by this. What happens is that one or both of the two molecules slows down such that the total &quot;molecular translational energy (MTE)&quot;, aka &quot;molecular kinetic energy&quot;, aka &quot;heat&quot;, is reduced by precisely the same amount as the MVE that the GHG molecule acquired, so (m1*v1**2 + m2*v2**2)/2 after collision is less than (m1*v1**2 + m2*v2**2)/2 before collision because either v1 or v2 or both was reduced, thus obeying the Law Of Conservation Of Energy. Effectively, the temperature of the 2 colliding molecules was reduced by an energy amount equaling the MVE that the GHG molecule acquired, what happened was energy transmutation from one form to another. When this vibrating GHG molecule hits another molecule it loses its vibration (note 1) and one or both of the two molecules speeds up such that the total MTE, aka &quot;heat&quot;, is increased by precisely the same amount as the MVE that the GHG molecule lost. So it just moved speed/heat from one N2 or O2 (almost always) molecule to another. However, ==here we go==, very occasionally/rarely and not very often at all compared with the 2,700,000,000 collisions / second that happen to this GHG molecule (note 2) the GHG molecule with MVE will spontaneously emit a photon of LWR and lose its MVE. Now it has converted one-photon&#39;s-worth of &quot;heat&quot; in the troposphere to one photon of LWR. It has cooled the troposphere by one-photon&#39;s-worth of &quot;heat&quot; (one molecule is now in a global Mini Ice Age ?). <br />------------------ <br />LWR is also radiated from the surfaces of liquids &amp; solids such as the surface of the ocean, the surfaces of water droplets in spray above the ocean, the surfaces of water droplets in clouds, the surfaces of any water droplets at all, the land surface, the surfaces of trees &amp; grass, the skins of animals, the surfaces of dust, salt, volcanic ash, any ash and any surface whatsoever on the ocean or land or in the troposphere. Except for 10% of this LWR whose photons happen to have wave-lengths in a band called &quot;the atmospheric window&quot; this LWR goes into the vast &quot;shimmer&quot; of LWR in the troposphere with a distribution of energy quantity at each wave-length in the LWR band that you&#39;ve all seen hundreds of plots of all over the place. <br />------------------ <br />GHG molecules also absorb LWR provided that the photon&#39;s energy (which is its wave-length) perfectly matches one of that GHG molecule&#39;s MVE mode energies and the photon goes through (or tries to go through) the area of the GHG molecule that absorbs that wave-length (obvious example, CO2 isn&#39;t at all fussy what part of its molecule a photon of wave-length 15.00 microns goes through, it&#39;ll swallow it and vibrate). Obviously, a GHG molecule neither knows nor cares whether a photon of a certain wave-length trying to go through it was emitted by the surface of the ocean, the surfaces of water droplets in spray above the ocean, the surfaces of water droplets in clouds, the surfaces of any water droplets at all, the land surface, the surfaces of trees &amp; grass, the skins of animals, the surfaces of dust, salt, volcanic ash, any ash and any surface whatsoever on the ocean or land or in the troposphere, or emitted by another GHG molecule (H2O, CO2, CH4, NO2 and any other GHG molecule) because all photons of the same wave-length are the same. A GHG molecule with MVE that it got by absorbing LWR can, of course, ==here we go again==, very occasionally/rarely and not very often at all compared with the 2,700,000,000 collisions / second that happen to this GHG molecule (note 2) spontaneously emit a photon of LWR and lose its MVE. In this case the GHG molecule transmuted LWR back to LWR, it transmuted a photon to an identical photon, so it did nothing at all other than change the direction in which the photon is going. This is the cartoon that scientists show the public because it&#39;s a simple analog that Earth tried to cool itself to space and failed, but since there are 2,700,000,000 collisions / second there&#39;s just about a bat&#39;s chance in hell that the GHG molecule will spontaneously emit a photon of LWR and lose its MVE before it collides and loses its MVE (note 1). The coal/oil shills use the highly-incorrect nature of this ludicrously-over-simplified cartoon to &quot;disprove&quot; the physics theory but it isn&#39;t the physics theory that&#39;s incorrect, it&#39;s the cartoon that&#39;s incorrect. It doesn&#39;t describe the physics theory hardly at all as I&#39;ve explained in detail above. This is why I dislike this cartoon. When a vibrating GHG molecule hits another molecule it loses its vibration (note 1) and one or both of the two molecules speeds up. This means that &quot;heat&quot; increased, what happened was energy transmutation from one form to another, energy transmutation from LWR to &quot;heat&quot; with MVE as the intermediary step.

I envision a very tall (at least a kilometer) vacuum encased containment of atmosphere. The containment should be a highly elongated O shape with one side allowing upward convection of heated air and the second side allowing downward movement of cooled air. Heat would be added at the bottom and the exact same amount of heat would be removed at the top. Various atmospheric compositions should be tested. The key variables would be CO2 and H2O. Thermocouples should be arrayed up and down both sides of the containment to measure the distribution of temperatures. <br /><br /><br />If anthropogenic CO2 is causing heating of our atmosphere, we should see a pooling of heat at the bottom of the apparatus as the percentage of CO2 is increased. <br /><br /><br />I used to write computer models for a living. I know how easily they can be tweaked. Given the political supercharging involved in the global warming controversy, we need hard physical data collected under controlled conditions that can be duplicated by more than one researcher. <br /><br /><br />Sorry, but computer models are much too vulnerable to scams, and too many researchers have personal vested interests to be trusted in a matter of this significance.

Not sure as to what you hoped to get out of this rambling prof, but it this is really not helping your &#39;bias combat&#39; image. Sure human activity has increased CO2. In fact that is the only fact the alarmists got right. But the suggested direct relation to global warming is of course a farce. How do you explain that in the North (!!) of Greenland remains of villages were found dating 4000 years ago living of agriculture. How do you explain that throughout the globe (from the alps to siberia to Iceland) the receding glaciers expose rooted tree-trunks dating back to the Roman era, indicating at least a 5 degrees warming climate? Since this fine professor suggest CO2 is the cause (not consequence) of a warmer climate, this means the Greenland Inuit and old romans would need to be driving polluting diesel cars....Gee,,,did not know that.... I think you better look at videos of retired professors in climatology and Nobel Laureates (ivar Giaever) that quit the IPCC as to get a better understanding of climate change. With this video featuring a highly political steered person (ask him why the IPCC does not release the underlying hockey stick data not even after court rulings) you are not doing yourself a favor..,...Big bummer.....

A computer that&#39;s 100,000,000x as fast as the present top supercomputers for the same price (100x for each of the 4 dimensions) is what can be done about it. That&#39;ll give a 900 x 900 x 10 metre grid shoe box with a 9-second time slice and resolve all fine detail of Earth&#39;s ecosphere to an ultra-fine degree of accuracy using this pixelated method of parameterization. It&#39;s the same as your screen &amp; camera pixels. If you zoom in enough you lose the picture and the &quot;Sabine Hossenfelder&quot; entity&#39;s face looks like a bunch of fuzzballs of varying colours. That&#39;s parameterization aka digitization of an apparently-analog entity (only apparently analog because Universe is likely binary digital at its lowest non-homogeneity). So each datum in the shoe box is resolved to an average for temperature, clouds, wind speed/direction, pressure, solar radiation in/absorbed, aerosols of each type, ocean current speed/direction, salinity and dozens of other vital data. If any one of those data items was mapped to colours/brightnesses and you viewed it and zoomed you&#39;d see the pixels and lose the picture. If you had something 1/5th of a pixel wide then you simply couldn&#39;t show it. ==However==, you don&#39;t have to parameterize to an average (and they likely don&#39;t). You could have a formula of any complexity that defines the temperature/cloud/wind/ pressure/sunshine/aerosols/current etc. in the shoe box as Value = f(x,y,z) where x,y,z are 3D distances from the lower SW box corner. You could have any level of complexity to get it increasingly accurate. Here&#39;s the issue though, it takes more computer time the more complex the formula so therefore ------ why not keep the formulae fast &amp; simple and use the computer time saved to have a smaller box such as 45 x 45 x 0.5 km x 7 minutes rather than 90 x 90 x 1.0 km x 15 minutes. I made these decisions myself in 2002 when I wrote a quick cheap computer simulation &quot;model&quot; as a web site Promo for my engineering consulting company career. Mine was very simple so I could instantiate almost all Objects and use minimal parameterization. It&#39;s impractical for clouds, computers not fast enough. To model clouds without parameterization would need to code a Droplet template and then instantiate Droplet Objects from it and develop them and move them about. Can you visualize how much computer time it would need to follow the formation, development and movement of a water droplet that forms on a particle from water vapour and grows, and do that for every water droplet throughout the model Earth. Bottom line is that Deep Thought couldn&#39;t do it so if pan-dimensional white mice needed to solve that they&#39;d need to commission Slartibartfast to build a custom fake planet, populate it with millions of nice species (especially effelumps) plus a species of totally entirely worthless fuckers such as exemplar fuckwit the coal/oil shill-fuckwitted entity &quot;Zdzislaw Meglicki &quot; down here somewhere, ---- and then let er rip !

In order to predict global surface temperatures, this fool would first have to know and understand what climate is and what is the source of heat that produces the climate (the background temperature of our planet). Anyone that would take any notice of computer models is not a scientist. Computer models only show what the programmer wants them to and has no relevance to the facts or data.

Firstly, is a warming climate a bad thing? If so why. Secondly, is more CO2 in the atmosphere a bad thing since this is plant food, increases plant growth and food production, uses less H20 in the process. They have been carrying on since the 80&#39;s about global warming and I am yet to see it. They said the sea levels would rise and they are yet to rise. In Australia, we just had a 30 cm dump of snow in SUMMER. Perhaps we should be more worried about a coming ice age!! Every time there is a bush fire they carry on about climate change. Someone forgot about all the arsonists who light the fires! Does climate change lead to more arsonists?	UCOyUqvB4TGnCIBKW9T7wTSg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOyUqvB4TGnCIBKW9T7wTSg	0

But perhaps there was one tipping point, and that was the point at which life developed. Life has thrived ever since and there have been no climate tipping points that have made all life extinct. Humans have a major problem which is that they think the earth exists just for them and they are in control of it all. Humans are a small blip in earth&#39;s history.<br />Human&#39;s are also incredibly stupid and are not adapting to scientific discoveries. It is impossible for any tipping point to exist in our climate, especially when that point is runaway temperatures, either increasing or decreasing. Thermodynamics is a stable process that always results in temperatures moving to an equilibrium. The only tipping point will be if the energy from the sun changes.

They have been caused by truly catastrophic volcanic events known as flood basalt eruptions. These events are far greater than super volcanoes. One event in what is now Siberia consisted of lava (basalt), ash, SO2, and CO2 being forcefully emitted from the ground across the entire area the size of France, for 350,000 years! Enough lava was spewed to cover the entire U.S. to a depth of nearly two miles. This started a chain of additional catastrophic events, including gases being released from the oceans, which dramatically changed the Earth's climate for many thousands of years. Nearly all of the single cell organisms on Earth, on land and in water, were wiped out. But those unimaginable events are really not comparable with today's mild, peaceful, stable conditions.

There is absolutely no falsifiable methodology for determining precisely, or roughly, the effect of CO2 levels on climate temperature. There is no laboratory model of planet Earth upon which CO2–temperature experiments can be run. <br /><br />Where are the facts in this video? I hear unproven theories and speculation.<br /><br />The reference to tipping points has no basis in observed or historical reality. In the paleo climate record, when CO2 has been 5 or 10 or 15 times higher that the current levels, we have not discovered previous tipping points. <br /><br />It annoys me to hear so-called experts demonstrate such a lack of critical, integrated thinking and such a inexplicable inability to distinguish between observable facts and speculation.<br /><br />Anyone, who points to climate models as evidence of anything we can count on as being representative of the future, might as well be looking into a crystal ball—for all that climate models are worth.

The Sun: -When you state that the Sun is *THE* driver, what exactly do you mean by driver? I see multiple ways of understanding that. Do you mean driver of climate or climate change or both? -The way I use it in this context is to mean the most significant factor that is forcing the climate at that time. -The Sun has been getting warmer during the history of the Earth. The temperature on Earth has not followed this trend through history. So the other factors are clearly relevant. About Data: Well, that depends on how and why you change the data and if you are transparent about it. If you have to compare two different data sets from different instruments, you may need to homogenize (I think that is the term) the data to make sure you are comparing apples to apples. Or you may need to account for local variables, such as with heat reading near cities. -Take the example of ocean temperature reading. The had ships to do it and then switched to buoys, but temperature readings from the ships had a bias because of the ships, showing slightly higher temperature. This was not a problem because the objective was to look at change in temperature, so they added the bias to the buoys readings because there were far fewer measurements and it was less work. - If you have any evidence of deliberate misleading, please point to it. Water vapor more potent: You are correct in that water vapor is more potent. But that does not allow you to ignore CO2. If water vapor is 7 times more potent, that still means that CO2 would be ~12.5% percent of the potency of water. That little extra heating allows the air to hold more water vapor, causing more heating, more release of CO2 and more water in the air. So, feedback loop. It also absorbs a little different range of radiation compared to water, narrowing the window for infrared radiation to escape. And yes, the more heat the more the Earth radiates, which is one of the factors that prevents the Earth from going full Hellhole.

My understanding of this goes something like this: - To start you have a some forcing (f.x. big eruption, asteroid strike, Earths orbit or tilt changes a little, ocean currents suddenly change, etc.). - After that the feedback loops take over and a small initial cooling or warming ends up freezing or thawing the planet. Those are of course the extremes and due to the multitude of factors, this process can be different at different times and end at a different equilibrium. - That means that the tipping points would be those that the initial forcing has to exceed to get the feedback loops going. About CO2, we know it catches infrared radiation, the type Earth radiates when heated. So it stands to reason that increased concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere should have a heating affect. It is only part of the puzzle of course, but it is the part we have the biggest effect on. You mention that CO2 has been higher in the past which is absolutely true and the correlation is not perfect. But when you factor in the sun as well (which was cooler in the past), the correlation gets very good. So I think this in not a lack of critical thinking, but of this being a very complicated problem and there being a lot of misinformation out there that makes this conversation a mess.

When you actually measure and observe instead of playing computer games, there is nothing there&quot;. <br />----------------- <br />The &quot;climate sensitivity&quot; is assessed by 18 paleo climate analyses, and is NOT needed to be addressed by the computer simulation &quot;climate models&quot;. The purpose of the &quot;climate models&quot; is to determine the major global &amp; regional climate changes that the ==definite and indisputable global warming caused by increased so-called greenhouse gases (GHGs)== will cause. To this end the &quot;climate models&quot; are good in parts like the parson&#39;s egg. When Tim says that &quot;climate models&quot; represent the global warming well he&#39;s not saying anything useful about the global warming because that&#39;s pinned in the range of +2.4 to +4.8 degrees per CO2 doubling by 18 paleo climate analyses so &quot;climate models&quot; would just be a waste of money if that&#39;s all they did, because proving something that&#39;s already proved by established physics backed up by 18 paleo climate analyses. If Tim is saying that the fact that the computer simulation &quot;climate models&quot; get the GMST increase correct, matching the 18 paleo climate analyses, indicates they are on the right track to get the major global &amp; regional climate changes correct then that makes some sense (though not a very great deal because the models vary in regional climate from model to model and from run to run). The computer simulation &quot;climate models&quot; will never model global &amp; regional climate changes with a very high degree of accuracy until a computer is available at a practical cost that is 10,000x as fast the present fastest computer (10x for each of the 4 dimensions) so the grid can be 9 x 9 km with correspondingly finer granularity in the vertical layering. The Gulf Stream, as random example, is narrower at some places than the &quot;pixel resolution&quot; (the grid spacing) of a &quot;climate model&quot;. <br />--------- <br />None of the pros &amp; cons of &quot;climate models&quot; have anything whatsoever to do with the fact that Earth&#39;s Global Mean Surface Temperature (GMST) will rise by between +2.4 and +4.8 degrees if CO2 is doubled and no other large relevant effects occur, such as the large air pollution &quot;global dimming&quot; that actually has occurred and is greatly holding back warming (Jim Hansen says &quot;The Faustian bargain&quot; of industry). <br />--------- <br />&quot;Zdzislaw Meglicki &quot; entity is a coal/oil shill-fuckwit or Russian troll.

UgyeCG1yP5zMEDcxrnV4AaABAg	0	0	2019-12-13 01:36:04	grindupBaker	<b>*</b> PART 1 OF 3 <b>*</b> <br />This is how the so-called &quot;greenhouse effect&quot; in Earth&#39;s troposphere causes warming. The so-called &quot;greenhouse effect&quot; effect is nothing at all like the effect that warms a greenhouse. A vast &quot;shimmer&quot; of transverse electromagnetic radiation (TER) in the long-wave band (LWR) is caused by molecules of water vapour (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (NO2) and some other gases in the troposphere due to their collisions (averaging 2,700,000,000 collisions / second) with other molecules, which are almost always going to be nitrogen (N2) or oxygen (O2) because they are almost all of the gas quantity in the troposphere. The H2O, CO2, CH4, NO2 and some other gases are being called &quot;greenhouse gases (GHGs)&quot; because the overall effect (not just this part) ends up causing warming of Earth&#39;s troposphere. All except H2O are called &quot;well-mixed greenhouse gases&quot; because their boiling and freezing points are so low that they don&#39;t condense or freeze in the troposphere, not even near the top, so they get spread out well mixed around Earth and well mixed vertically in the troposphere. The well-mixed GHGs now punch above their weight compared with water vapour (H2O) because the upper half of the troposphere is so cold that almost all H2O forms on dust/salt particles in liquid or solid form there rather than being a GHG but the others remain as GHGs. The lowest quarter or so of the troposphere where it&#39;s warmer and water vapour (H2O) is king is already highly &quot;saturated&quot; without much additional &quot;enhanced greenhouse effect&quot; possible (still, H2O has such a broad absorption band that it still manages to match CO2 pretty much exactly 1:1 net as a 100% +ve feedback). <br />------------------ <br />The GHG molecules don&#39;t emit a photon (LWR unit) of LWR when they collide and they don&#39;t later get to emit a photon of LWR after every collision, only after a few of them (note 1). What happens is that a collision might cause a GHG molecule to vibrate in a certain way (so with a certain energy) of which the GHG molecule has the capability of any one of a selection (called its &quot;vibrational modes&quot;). GHG molecules with more vibrational modes are more powerful GHGs because they have a broader absorption/emission band. The GHG molecule now has &quot;molecular vibrational energy (MVE)&quot; if the collision did cause it to vibrate. Energy cannot be created without destroying matter and matter doesn&#39;t get destroyed by this. What happens is that one or both of the two molecules slows down such that the total &quot;molecular translational energy (MTE)&quot;, aka &quot;molecular kinetic energy&quot;, aka &quot;heat&quot;, is reduced by precisely the same amount as the MVE that the GHG molecule acquired, so (m1*v1**2 + m2*v2**2)/2 after collision is less than (m1*v1**2 + m2*v2**2)/2 before collision because either v1 or v2 or both was reduced, thus obeying the Law Of Conservation Of Energy. Effectively, the temperature of the 2 colliding molecules was reduced by an energy amount equaling the MVE that the GHG molecule acquired, what happened was energy transmutation from one form to another. When this vibrating GHG molecule hits another molecule it loses its vibration (note 1) and one or both of the two molecules speeds up such that the total MTE, aka &quot;heat&quot;, is increased by precisely the same amount as the MVE that the GHG molecule lost. So it just moved speed/heat from one N2 or O2 (almost always) molecule to another. However, ==here we go==, very occasionally/rarely and not very often at all compared with the 2,700,000,000 collisions / second that happen to this GHG molecule (note 2) the GHG molecule with MVE will spontaneously emit a photon of LWR and lose its MVE. Now it has converted one-photon&#39;s-worth of &quot;heat&quot; in the troposphere to one photon of LWR. It has cooled the troposphere by one-photon&#39;s-worth of &quot;heat&quot; (one molecule is now in a global Mini Ice Age ?). <br />------------------ <br />LWR is also radiated from the surfaces of liquids &amp; solids such as the surface of the ocean, the surfaces of water droplets in spray above the ocean, the surfaces of water droplets in clouds, the surfaces of any water droplets at all, the land surface, the surfaces of trees &amp; grass, the skins of animals, the surfaces of dust, salt, volcanic ash, any ash and any surface whatsoever on the ocean or land or in the troposphere. Except for 10% of this LWR whose photons happen to have wave-lengths in a band called &quot;the atmospheric window&quot; this LWR goes into the vast &quot;shimmer&quot; of LWR in the troposphere with a distribution of energy quantity at each wave-length in the LWR band that you&#39;ve all seen hundreds of plots of all over the place. <br />------------------ <br />GHG molecules also absorb LWR provided that the photon&#39;s energy (which is its wave-length) perfectly matches one of that GHG molecule&#39;s MVE mode energies and the photon goes through (or tries to go through) the area of the GHG molecule that absorbs that wave-length (obvious example, CO2 isn&#39;t at all fussy what part of its molecule a photon of wave-length 15.00 microns goes through, it&#39;ll swallow it and vibrate). Obviously, a GHG molecule neither knows nor cares whether a photon of a certain wave-length trying to go through it was emitted by the surface of the ocean, the surfaces of water droplets in spray above the ocean, the surfaces of water droplets in clouds, the surfaces of any water droplets at all, the land surface, the surfaces of trees &amp; grass, the skins of animals, the surfaces of dust, salt, volcanic ash, any ash and any surface whatsoever on the ocean or land or in the troposphere, or emitted by another GHG molecule (H2O, CO2, CH4, NO2 and any other GHG molecule) because all photons of the same wave-length are the same. A GHG molecule with MVE that it got by absorbing LWR can, of course, ==here we go again==, very occasionally/rarely and not very often at all compared with the 2,700,000,000 collisions / second that happen to this GHG molecule (note 2) spontaneously emit a photon of LWR and lose its MVE. In this case the GHG molecule transmuted LWR back to LWR, it transmuted a photon to an identical photon, so it did nothing at all other than change the direction in which the photon is going. This is the cartoon that scientists show the public because it&#39;s a simple analog that Earth tried to cool itself to space and failed, but since there are 2,700,000,000 collisions / second there&#39;s just about a bat&#39;s chance in hell that the GHG molecule will spontaneously emit a photon of LWR and lose its MVE before it collides and loses its MVE (note 1). The coal/oil shills use the highly-incorrect nature of this ludicrously-over-simplified cartoon to &quot;disprove&quot; the physics theory but it isn&#39;t the physics theory that&#39;s incorrect, it&#39;s the cartoon that&#39;s incorrect. It doesn&#39;t describe the physics theory hardly at all as I&#39;ve explained in detail above. This is why I dislike this cartoon. When a vibrating GHG molecule hits another molecule it loses its vibration (note 1) and one or both of the two molecules speeds up. This means that &quot;heat&quot; increased, what happened was energy transmutation from one form to another, energy transmutation from LWR to &quot;heat&quot; with MVE as the intermediary step.

UgxT-oXYQc_mzRPiSEZ4AaABAg	0	0	2019-12-13 01:35:20	grindupBaker	<b>*</b> PART 2 OF 3 <b>*</b> <br />Now the so-called &quot;enhanced greenhouse effect&quot; explanation that I think is clearest, obvious and difficult to challenge by mis-direction disinformation and subterfuge per the memes concocted by the coal/oil shills. 17% of the LWR that Earth sends to space is emitted by the ocean or land surface because the photons are in a wave-length band called &quot;the atmospheric window&quot; that doesn&#39;t get absorbed by the GHGs. It&#39;s my understanding that this will narrow slightly with increased GHGs, but this isn&#39;t the prime &quot;enhanced greenhouse effect&quot; and I&#39;m not addressing any additional warming it might cause. 83% of the LWR that Earth sends to space is emitted by the GHG molecules in the troposphere, tropopause and stratosphere (note 2). This 83% of the LWR is the part that gets reduced by increased tropospheric GHGs and causes an energy imbalance with insufficient energy going out, which causes global warming, ocean heating and ice fusion, which causes climate change, which causes a variety of nuisances that I haven&#39;t studied. <br />------------------ <br />The troposphere has an upper and a lower surface. The upper surface is the top of the troposphere (the tropopause) and the lower surface is the surface of the ocean or land. LWR produced in the troposphere that reaches the lower surface will warm that surface so it stays in Earth&#39;s ecosphere but LWR produced in the troposphere that reaches the upper surface has a good chance to make it through the increasingly-thin tropopause, stratosphere and the ultra-thin extended atmosphere to space and be energy lost to Earth&#39;s ecosphere, thus cooling it. LWR reaching the upper/lower surfaces was produced by GHG molecules, the surfaces of water droplets and the surfaces of solid particles (sea salt, ash, dust) throughout the troposphere sending photons upwards/downwards as described in detail earlier. <br />- There is an average altitude in the troposphere of the LWR quantity that reaches space. If you could float at this altitude and watch/count photons with special eye balls and brain you&#39;d see 50% of those photons that reach space are heading up from below you. If you counted it at 48% then you&#39;d need to float upward to get more of the LWR photon production below you. If you counted it at 52% then you&#39;d need to float downward to get more of the LWR photon production above you. This is obvious. When you float to the place where 50.0000000% of those photons that reach space are heading up from below you then you are at the average altitude in the troposphere of the LWR quantity that reaches space. <br />- There is an average altitude in the troposphere of the LWR quantity that reaches the surface of the ocean or land. You could float and find that the same way as the preceding. <br />These 2 altitudes in the troposphere are approximately for illustration only and as a global average (I&#39;m not quantifying the so-called &quot;enhanced greenhouse effect&quot; in this comment, only describing its operation accurately): <br />---- average --- ---- average global ---- <br />---- altitude --- ---- temperature ---- <br />6,600 metres -29.75 degrees 50% of the &quot;shimmer cloud&quot; of LWR photons that will make it to the tropopause are emitted by GHG molecules and the surfaces of cloud droplets and atmospheric particles below this altitude. <br />1,650 metres 3.7 degrees 50% of the &quot;shimmer cloud&quot; of LWR photons that will make it to the surface of the ocean or land are emitted by GHG molecules and the surfaces of cloud droplets and atmospheric particles below this altitude. <br />These values are approximate. They are to demonstrate how the so-called &quot;enhanced greenhouse effect&quot; works, not to provide quantities. They are approximately correct though. They are based on a global average ~12,000 metres height of the troposphere but it varies geographically from 9,000 to 16,000 metres. <br />--------------- <br />If tropospheric GHGs are increased then 2 changes occur per my explanations above since the start of my comment: <br />1) More LWR than before is produced by the GHGs, and <br />2) More LWR than before is absorbed by the GHGs because the LWR photons have to make it through more GHG molecules that might absorb them before they can reach their goal of going up past the top of the troposphere or going down past the bottom of the troposphere and being absorbed into the ocean or land. <br />Note that I have not included &quot;(3) The LWR photons emitted by the surface of the ocean and land have to make it through more GHG molecules that might absorb them before they can reach space&quot; because I&#39;m dealing with the 83% of the LWR reaching space that&#39;s created by GHG molecules in the troposphere obtaining, then losing, MVE with spontaneous photon emission caused. I&#39;m not dealing with the 17% of the LWR in a wave-length band called &quot;the atmospheric window&quot; that gets directly to space after being emitted by the surface of the ocean and land. If that 17% is reduced by increased tropospheric GHGs (I&#39;m not sure) then that&#39;s an additional, unrelated, means of the so-called &quot;enhanced greenhouse effect&quot; (there&#39;s no particular reason why there has to be only one mechanism). <br />--------------- <br />The result of combined effects/changes (1), (2) above is that the average altitude in the troposphere of the LWR quantity that reaches the top of the troposphere gets higher, so perhaps it raises from the 6,600 metres to 6,700 metres (as an example). Also, the LWR quantity is reduced slightly (the so-called &quot;enhanced greenhouse effect&quot;) for reason of the tropospheric temperature lapse rate explained below. <br />--------------- <br />Likewise, identically, the average altitude in the troposphere of the LWR quantity that reaches the surface of the ocean or land gets lower, so perhaps it lowers from the 1,650 metres to 1,550 metres (obviously, it depends on the change quantity. I just showed a random example) because it has to get past more GHG molecules that might absorb the photon. <br />--------------- <br />In either case GHG photons were trying to reach their goal of the top or bottom of the troposphere but now there are more GHGs in the way so it needs, == on average ==, to be a bit closer to make it. So that&#39;s why the &quot;cloud&quot; of LWR that will reach the top is a higher cloud than before and the &quot;cloud&quot; of LWR that will reach the bottom (ocean or land) is a lower cloud than before <br />--------------- <br />The tropospheric temperature lapse rate is required to cause the so-called &quot;enhanced greenhouse effect&quot;. <br />The average altitude for LWR to space got higher (6,600 metres ---&gt; 6,700 metres in my example) which means LWR to space is from colder (slower) molecules on average because tropospheric temperature decreases with altitude and LWR to space is from higher-up-than-before molecules on average, so there are fewer GHG molecular collisions / second which leads to less MVE which leads to less LWR production. The quantity of LWR energy (power flux) provided by a mass of gas is proportional to its temperature(Kelvin)**4 (to the fourth power) so, as explained in detail above, the increasing of tropospheric GHGs ==must== cause less LWR than before to be passing upwards through the top of the troposphere. <br />That&#39;s the upper end of how the so-called &quot;enhanced greenhouse effect&quot; works.

The quantity of LWR energy (power flux) provided by a mass of gas is proportional to its temperature(Kelvin)**4 (to the fourth power) so, as explained in detail above, the increasing of tropospheric GHGs ==must== cause more LWR than before to be passing downwards to the surface of the ocean and land. This latter is called &quot;downwelling LWR radiation at the surface&quot; and I&#39;ve explained why it must increase and this must, of course, warm the land and ocean surface. <br />That&#39;s the lower end of how the so-called &quot;enhanced greenhouse effect&quot; works. <br />--------- <br />Note 1: I haven&#39;t yet found the collision MVE production &amp; destruction spectra so I don&#39;t know what %age make MVE and what %age destroy MVE. I looked a few hours 4 years ago but couldn&#39;t find it (not for free anyway). It makes no difference to the description of the mechanism above but it would be needed to confirm the quantity of effect for doubling CO2. <br />Note 2: I&#39;ve read on the internet that spontaneous emission of a photon of LWR by a GHG molecule with MVE will typically occur after ~1.0 seconds with MVE but I&#39;m not accepting that without some serious fact checking which I haven&#39;t done yet. One photon / second just seems way too minuscule to me. I also need that information to calculate whether mis-calibration method of the STAR MSU/AMSU instrument makes the RSS &amp; UAH TLT temperature O2 proxy analyses analyse a significantly lower total of energy than thermometers measure, or whether the difference is negligible. It makes no difference to the description of the mechanism above. <br />Note 3: 80% of Earth&#39;s atmosphere is in the troposphere (the top of which is 16 km in the tropics and 9 km in the polar regions, averaging ~12,000 metres). The &quot;greenhouse effect&quot; warming can only happen in Earth&#39;s troposphere, there&#39;s no effect in Earth&#39;s tropopause and the effect is &quot;backwards&quot; in Earth&#39;s stratosphere with =increased= stratospheric GHG gases causing =cooling= of the stratosphere because the stratospheric temperature lapse rate has temperature increasing with altitude (that&#39;s how it&#39;s known with total certainty that it&#39;s increased &quot;greenhouse gases (GHGs)&quot; doing the global warming for the last several decades). Since there&#39;s no temperature lapse rate in the tropopause then any change in the quantity/type of GHGs in the tropopause cannot have any warming or cooling effect on the tropopause or the entire atmosphere, ocean or land. No effect at all. If you follow my description of the effect above for the troposphere but apply it to the tropopause then you&#39;ll clearly see that any change in the quantity/type of GHGs in the tropopause cannot have any warming or cooling effect That&#39;s the reality. The increasing GHGs in the stratosphere are a slight -ve feedback to global warming because downwelling LWR radiation from the stratosphere increases with increased GHGs, but it&#39;s a very slight -ve feedback because only 6.3% of the well-mixed GHGs (and all molecules) are above the tropopause and they are initially colder than the average of the troposphere so they make even less LWR than the 6.3% factor. By the time the stratosphere warms more than the average of the troposphere there&#39;s only 0.4% of Earth&#39;s atmosphere&#39;s molecules above, negligible. <br />Note 4: FTIR power flux vs wave-length spectra recorded by the instrument on a satellite show which wave-lengths of LWR heading to space past the satellite came from the surface of the ocean and land and which wave-lengths came, on average, from the GHG molecules and surfaces of solid particles and water droplets in the atmosphere. From this atmospheric physicists have calculated the 83% of the LWR that Earth sends to space that is emitted by the atmosphere rather than by the surface of the ocean and land. Also, the MODTRAN tool on the internet can be used to play with a theoretical calculation of the FTIR power flux vs wave-length spectra by adjusting GHGs.

Ugw5XBi-QitL6QqjWJR4AaABAg	0	0	2019-12-13 01:24:36	grindupBaker	@​ Zdzislaw Meglicki There&#39;s a PNAS-published recent paper similar to the one you were coal/oil shill-fuckwittedly babbling about. It includes &quot;To calculate the net cooling of aerosols in a spherical framework, one must count the increases in both incident and reflected sunlight, thus reducing the aerosol effect by 10 to 14% relative to using just the increase in reflected. Simple fixes to the current flat Earth climate models can correct much of this oversight, although some inconsistencies will remain&quot;. <br />So, it&#39;s stating that the aerosol effect best estimate of 1.41 m/m**2 cooling attempt since 1750 AD has been overstated by 10 to 14%. If correct this means that the &quot;greenhouse gas&quot; (GHG) forcing since 1750 AD has been overstated and therefore &quot;climate sensitivity&quot; is 3% to 5% lower than previously thought. So, 3.1 to 3.20 degrees instead of the 3.3 degrees previously considered correct. Considering that air pollution aerosols already have massive uncertainty ranges on them in the IPCC AR5 this is a very very minor revelation even if its science is correct.

A real one or many based on ACTAUL measurements and science not the fairy-tale journey towards a lake you portray here. I have a better more scientifically relevant analogy for you. We'll keep the water theme but this time a river. The water flowing is energy moving out to space. CO2 is taking a stake and planting it in the riverbed. Adding more CO2 makes it longer. Once out he water it's doing nothing. Reality is more like adding a stake behind the last one, and again and again. This is how adding to the mass of the atmosphere can calculate an actual effect of doubling CO2.

This is why most climate sceptics are experts in their field and retired. It has become the greatest fraud on science, it's application and methods. Sacking people for showing an alternate hypotheses or even for telling the truth such as Prof Peter Ridd for telling the truth about the great Barrier reef. "Climate scientists" seem to be like a car mechanic telling you the engine is about to blow up instead of that programmed Integrated circuit that had some that failed giving a knock on effect for a sensor reporting the wrong data that in turn generates the wrong fault codes. The mechanic is clueless to the deeper components of a system he claims to be "expert in" Real experts in their field know the complexities and problems of measuring a massively complex system dependant on masses of energy in constant turmoil.

It's necessary for the institutions to act top-down paternalistic in order to serve their purpose as authority, problem being that the expansion of recording media into the most private and/or casual corners of conversation enforces a timidity in dialogue among the intellectually cautious that has not been a part of previous intellectual cultures.

The real question is whether any alleged climate change is anthropogenic (i.e. &quot;caused by people&quot;). It isn&#39;t. We have more to worry from the eccentricity of the earth&#39;s orbit, large volcanic eruptions, asteroid strikes. PhDs have become skilled at bootlicking and asskissing, experience that they gain (1) from academia, as they progress to get their PhDs, and (2) chasing after/begging for grant money. There is no global warming. Go back to what you were doing.	UCusb1khHtljMJtxu5Qdh9aw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCusb1khHtljMJtxu5Qdh9aw	0

UgzJUdb_VNT10178cJB4AaABAg	8	0	2019-12-12 13:31:10	Zdzislaw Meglicki	A recently published PNAS paper [1] points to an error that plagues all present day &quot;climate models.&quot; It turns out, they assume locally flat earth. You see, on a spherical planet a computational column should widen with altitude, it doesn&#39;t in the models. To quote from the paper, &quot;Correcting from flat to spherical atmospheres leads to regionally differential solar heating at rates comparable to the climate forcing by greenhouse gases and aerosols. In addition, spherical atmospheres change how we evaluate the aerosol direct radiative forcing.&quot;<br /><br />That such a horrendous error should remain unaddressed for so long really points to extremely poor computational, mathematical, and physics skills in the &quot;climate change&quot; community. Let&#39;s be frank about this: their present day models are Mickey Mouse cartoons, unphysical, unscientific, full of bugs, omissions. They don&#39;t do clouds, they don&#39;t do convection, because, first, they don&#39;t have the resolution to do it, and, second, they don&#39;t know how. What they don&#39;t know, they kludge, and it is this kludging that produces excessive heating.<br /><br />&quot;Climate Change&quot; is a computational artifact. When you actually measure and observe instead of playing computer games, there is nothing there. The current climate parameters are all perfectly within the known bounds of natural variability. Human impact, whatever it may be, is completely swamped by observational [2] and computational [3] error.<br /><br />[1] <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1908198116">https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1908198116</a> (PNAS, September 9, 2019)<br />[2] <a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/rs11050589">https://doi.org/10.3390/rs11050589</a> (Remote Sensing, March 11, 2019)<br />[3] <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/feart.2019.00223">https://doi.org/10.3389/feart.2019.00223</a> (Frontiers in Earth Science, September 6, 2019)	UC3sDk0rKzOrMQE_eE1JpG_Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3sDk0rKzOrMQE_eE1JpG_Q	0

I have provided you with the reference (see the first post above), you haven't. Anyhow, the geometric error that [1] in my first post talks about is substantial and of the same order as the claimed forcing by greenhouse gases, which in the context makes the error "horrendous." It gets even worse at higher latitudes. I have also quoted the actual numbers from the paper that show this. And, no, the "climate sensitivity to CO2 doubling" isn't 3.1 (or 3.2) degrees. There is another recently published paper[*] (by Smirnov) that points to errors in climate model calculations of how CO2 molecules interact with the incoming and outgoing radiation. When the calculations are done correctly, it turns out climate sensitivity to CO2 doubling at the present atmospheric concentration is only (0.4 +/- 0.1)K. And all the warming that can be attributed to fossil fuels use since preindustrial times is a puny 0.02K. It is so small as to be practically unmeasurable. Climate models... fake it. The huge divergence in their predictions, both from each other and from the actual observations, points not only to errors and omissions, but also, importantly, to considerable real disagreements amongst climate scientists, since every model represents an opinion of a certain group. The one model that appears best is the Russian INM-CM4[**]. Why? Because it is the only one that predicted the hiatus in the early 21st century.

It includes "To calculate the net cooling of aerosols in a spherical framework, one must count the increases in both incident and reflected sunlight, thus reducing the aerosol effect by 10 to 14% relative to using just the increase in reflected. Simple fixes to the current flat Earth climate models can correct much of this oversight, although some inconsistencies will remain". So, it's stating that the aerosol effect best estimate of 1.41 m/m**2 cooling attempt since 1750 AD has been overstated by 10 to 14%. If correct this means that the "greenhouse gas" (GHG) forcing since 1750 AD has been overstated and therefore "climate sensitivity" is 3% to 5% lower than previously thought. So, 3.1 to 3.20 degrees instead of the 3.3 degrees previously considered correct. Considering that air pollution aerosols already have massive uncertainty ranges on them in the IPCC AR5 this is a very very minor revelation even if its science is correct.

If you care to look at the abstract of the paper, and at the paper itself, you'll find the following: "Spherical atmospheres intercept 2.5 W⋅m−2 more sunlight and heat the climate by an additional 1.5 W⋅m−2 globally. Such a systematic shift, being comparable to the radiative forcing change from preindustrial to present, is likely to produce a discernible climate shift that would alter a model’s skill in simulating current climate. Regional heating errors, particularly at high latitudes, are several times larger."

The only semblance of accuracy comes from fudging the models to better fit the past or fudging the temp record to better fit the models. Climate science is done, it&#39;s hardly a science when not a single prediction beyond it get&#39;s warmer (which is 1 out of 3 to get right by just guessing) has materialized so far. The maledives are still here, ski slopes open earlier every year, neither the pole ice nor the glaciers are gone and weather catastrophies are at a historic low. Everything is just fine.

The hypothesis is simple, heat is being added to the eco system. This should be measurable across the eco system, or it doesn't exist. Yes, local variations will exist. But ON AVERAGE you should see it over a 120 year period. A lack of any change in two geographical areas are VERY interesting results, but require a much wider look to know if those locations are anomalous or typical. Furthermore: This is brilliant backyard science. I've done the same thing with some measurements of average sea level. There have been small changes in the last 100 years, but nothing on the scale that the climate alarmists are talking about.

Are Denver and Dallas representative samples? If so, then climate is not changing. If not, then it says nothing about climate change since they are not representative, and therefor irrelevant. Climate science uses representative samples - the question is are these samples representative, are they accurate, and are the corrections made to the samples acceptable.

Is that why you believe in climate change did someone bully you too? Is that how good science works? My point was when a weather event like a hurricane or flood happens its blamed on climate change but when a record cold snap or snow in june its a weather anomaly and does not prove global warming doesn't exists. You know that cherry picking you were talking about. You have to start with the assumption that co2 and climate change cause every weather event except the ones that disprove your presupposition. But hey don't fret I will do as im told or you call me mean things in the name of "science" not sure why all science isn't like that.

Certainly, but if you look at the radiative balance of earth's atmosphere you will notice, that more CO2 leads to higher average temperatures, guaranteed. And that part is easy enough to calculate with a school level physics understanding. What changes in climate are being kicked off by them is more complex, but can be approximated with models. Like feedback loops, cloud coverage, precipitation patterns, change in albedo, etc. "I'm not a climate denier. Climate exists." I do not think there is *any* doubt, when I, the scientist in the video or in general when people talk about the contemporary climate change, that we are talking about *anthropogenic* climate change. You seem to deny that. So do not try to be smart with me. "Sometimes it is a warmer climate and sometimes it's a colder climate." And that happens by magic, or what? Or are there mechanisms we can describe as laws of nature and pack approximations into a model? "... and so the scientists worried that we were headed for an extended cooling trend." Oh, come on. Just try to find and read those publications and be surprised how few scientists "worried" about a colder climate within this century and because of what causes ... seriously it is the second time I ask you to do so. You would realize that the assumptions made in these publications are not applicable to our situation today. If you actually find one of the few. (I am not going to do the work since you clearly didn't even read the publications I provided) "And about 15 years ago, when the phrase "Global Warming" was replaced by "Climate Change", it was an admission that they didn't know which way it was going, really." Again with the same bullshit. There are several reasons why this didn't happen. Just two are: 1.) These terms mean *diffrent* things. Global Warming (GW) refers to rising *average global temperatures* , while Climate Change (CC) refers to a *changing climate induced by human activity* , which temperatures are just a small part of and the focus lies more on regional changes. 2.) If "they" (whoever that is) replaced GW with CC, would you not find a decrease in the use of the one while the other rises? But when I check, both terms were simultaneously in use. You should check that yourself for once instead of just believing some other idiot. The term "climate change" was in 1956 already in use and since then the use of that term became more and more commen in the scientific literatur. As I showed you with a publication before. Do you even read!? The same goes for GW. "CO2 was steadily rising in the atmosphere, yet the temperatures were not rising correspondingly." Dude, are you just copy&pasting stuff without reading it? You certainly didn't check it against reality. Temperatures not rising is just a myth, the rising trend in temperatures never halted, it is just overlaid with natural variations, due to NAO and ENSO, etc.. Just take a good look at the average global temperatures and calculate a 20-30 year trend line. It is something you can do yourself. "While it is certain that mankind contributes to the rise in CO2, ..." Well, at least I do not have to go into this. "a rise in temperature of about 2 degrees ... where the rise in temps will start to level off ..." Only if we stop emitting more CO2/green house gasses *and* certain tipping points aren't reached. Like major tawing of the permafrost, outgassing from the oceans and change in albedo of the north polar sea, due to sea ice melt, etc.. But at some point humans will stop producing CO2, willingly or because of the collapse of our economy. Just as an example look at Venus and wonder how well the off leveling worked there. Also, even just a 2°C rise in global average temperatures will have sever effects on some regions. Most won't have the resources to deal with it. (here have a look, https://interactive.carbonbrief.org/impacts-climate-change-one-point-five-degrees-two-degrees ) "... due to the complex nature of the CO2 molecule." If you think CO2 is a complex molecule or has a complex nature, then never study chemistry. "Water vapor and clouds are more important than CO2 when you consider climate." While water vapor has a strong green house effect, it is not important for our situation as the water vapor content of our atmosphere is directly coupled to the temperatur (so only important as a positive feedback loop) and it has a short dwell time in atmosphere. Also, average water vapor content didn't change much, which means there is almost no change on the radiative balance coming from water. Clouds are diffrent matter since aerosols influence their formation, and that they warm in the high latitudes and cool in the tropics. In general their influence has a high uncertainty. But smaller than the influence of even CO2 alone. "The complex motion of the earth in relation to the sun may also affect climate." lol, may? It absolutly does! What do you think was the likely cause of prior glaciation events (not talking about the "little Ice Age" here, but an actual glacial)? But that effect is slow, too slow to play a role here, today. "The sun ..." is the second best studied heavenly object after the earth. One would assume we would notice a significant change in it's output. "So, it may be the sun has more control over climate on earth than man." Wishful thinking. The cooling effect experienced during the Maunder minimum (-0,25 W/m² translating to 0,1 - 0,3 °C) was a magnitude smaller than what we already experience from the extra green house gasses today (2,4 W/m²). "because CO2 depletes the ozone layer." lol, dafuq!? No. There is *no* chemical mechanism that would deplete the ozone layer of ozone by CO2. You/Dyson (whoever that is) might have confused it with ClO (chlormonoxid radical) or NOx (various nitrous oxids). On the contrary actually, the warmer conditions over the poles in a climate with more CO2, where the ozone layer reaches quite low, might protect it from decay by ClO and NOx. (I need to look into it, to be sure) "The earth's climate is very complex, ..." And still you simply assume that "plant life will thrive, and expand into deserts" because only of rising CO2 levels, dispite the need of plants for a lot more than just CO2. You might not have noticed, but wooded areas worldwide are in rapid decline (of human causes). So much for sequestering CO2 in biomass. Sorry. Your post looks like some copy&paste thing since you didn't even adresse the points I made. If you do not check your claims on the replacement of GW with CC, the emergence of the idea of CO2 as green house gas 125 years ago and more, and the supposed halt in temperature rise in the 2000's, I am not going to respond any further, since this is going to be just a waste of time on my hand.

You can't accurately plant the "climate denier" label on me. I'm not a climate denier. Climate exists. Climates change, always. Sometimes it is a warmer climate and sometimes it's a colder climate. When I mentioned Aldous Huxley recommending immigrating to Canada, scientists were certain that the earth was warming. But in the 60s, the climate was cooler for approximately a decade, and so the scientists worried that we were headed for an extended cooling trend. And about 15 years ago, when the phrase "Global Warming" was replaced by "Climate Change", it was an admission that they didn't know which way it was going, really. CO2 was steadily rising in the atmosphere, yet the temperatures were not rising correspondingly. The earth is warming, though. And it is accepted in most circles that the earth will experience a rise in temperature of about 2 degrees in the next hundred years. However, the panic politics involved claims that it will be runaway temperature rise. While it is certain that mankind contributes to the rise in CO2, as you saw in that Happer video there is a saturation point, where the rise in temps will start to level off due to the complex nature of the CO2 molecule. Water vapor and clouds are more important than CO2 when you consider climate. The complex motion of the earth in relation to the sun may also affect climate. And the sun spews out cosmic rays which penetrate our atmosphere, which many scientists suspect has an effect on cloud formation and therefore the climate. And the sun's sunspots seem to correlate with warming and cooling of the earth. In the late 1700s and the early 1800s, the earth was experiencing a cold phase, and at that same time, there were almost no sunspots. So, it may be the sun has more control over climate on earth than man. If you are serious about reducing CO2 in the atmosphere, then there are practical ways of doing that. Planting millions of trees, like they've done recently in India and China, due to their guilt complex for building coal fired power plants, is a very good way to sequester CO2. Dyson also wants to reduce the CO2 in the atmosphere, not because of global warming, but because CO2 depletes the ozone layer. And he recommends that we invest in development of crops and trees with larger root systems which will sequester more carbon in the ground. He also suggests that if America were to increase it's top soil by about 1 or 2 percent per year, that would offset the carbon emitted by the coal fired power plants that China is in the process of building. As the earth warms, and CO2 rises, plant life will thrive, and expand into deserts, because most vegetation evolved when there was more CO2 in the atmosphere. And as biosphere benefits and grows, it will sequester more carbon. And as the temperature rises, there may well be more cloud cover. The earth's climate is very complex, and the models are not capable of predicting climate, due to this complexity and the modifying effects on climate by the biosphere and cloud cover.

You began the argument with "A thousand years ago, ..." talking about the medieval climate anomaly (MCA) and now you link articles from several media concerning material found from diffrent time periods including the stoneage, at least 5000 years ago. What point are you trying to do? It would help if you would elaborate your position if you want to have an argument, instead of seemingly copy pasting links from a prepared repository without any context. Atm. it seems to me, that you adressed only about two lines of text I wrote. Just the first paragraph after the tl;dr. What about your misconception of the term "global warming" being replaced by "climate change"? Did you check it like I asked you to do? You would have realized that this replacment of terms never happend. Did you read the publication from 125 years ago concerning how the CO2 content influences temperatures? It proves that this is a far older "scare" than only 25 years. Have you tried to find other "plateaus" in the temperature record? You will find several since the 1950s that are adding up to a nice stairway.

I was hurt by your distrust of me, for 20 to 30 seconds. Here's some interesting reading. https://climateaudit.org/2005/11/18/archaeological-finds-in-retreating-swiss-glacier/ https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/2000-artifacts-pulled-edge-norways-melting-glaciers-180967949/ http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7580294.stm https://www.huffpost.com/entry/pre-viking-tunic-found-glacier-climate-change_n_2932431	UCuH31jHKz9PcTMsdGsCqf2g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuH31jHKz9PcTMsdGsCqf2g	1	UgyuLd2hfe-h9BDm0DJ4AaABAg	no name
UgyuLd2hfe-h9BDm0DJ4AaABAg.92Oo_WcWAvq9BOWzv9Jvq6		0	2020-07-21 23:13:16	Scribble Scrabble	​@mu99ins First the TL.DR: You could have avoided a lot of these misconceptions, if you would have checked your claims first. "I remember reading a story about the alarming shrinking glaciers in the Alps. " During the "little ice age" several villages were threatend by advancing glaciers, might be that a few were actually razed by one. I would be supprised though, if one would find a village after a glacier ground it up, maybe only holes for beams holding up a roof? "Are you saying the earth was not warm back a thousand years ago?" Warm? That's relativ. The temperatures during the medieval climate anomaly (MCA) were certainly slightly warmer than those during the little ice age (LIA), at least for the northern hemisphere. But the last three, maybe five, decades were certainly warmer than during the MCA, regionally and globally. Also, todays change in temperature is happening a lot faster than during the intermediate periode from MCA to LIA. And are you going to tell me now, that there is no wine-grower in Britain today? "... and then CO2 caused warming. My opinion is that it's much more complex of a situation, ..." complex maybe, but in the end the same amount of energy coming in from the sun onto the planet needs to leave or an imbalance happens, which results in a change of the average global temperature, and that is the easy part to figure out. You can do that yourself, basic school physics. How rising temperatures affect the climate is a whole other matter. "It's a bit unfair of you to require, after the fact, that this is only about climate change." Since the titel of the video to this comment thread is "Did scientists get *climate change* wrong?" and the comments revolving around this topic, it shouldn't even needed to be mentioned that the topic should remain climate change, and to be precise anthropogenic climate change. That is not an unfair constraint. "scientists were fretting about global cooling." Not really "fretting". There were a few scientists and researchers who published such findings. But under specific assumptions. If you would have read these publications you would know, that these aren't applicable to our situation today. Since you are curious, I am sure you are going to look these publications up and read them yourself now. Maybe then you will understand that the stories in the media were hugely exaggerated. Today we would call that Click Bait. When the temperatures didn't rise in conjunction with the rise in CO2 after the turn of this century, ..." but they did rise. That "plateau" some anthropogenic climate change deniers wanted to see in the temperature development exists only if you pick and choose the data points for a linear regression. Actually, you can do that for several periods of the second half of the last century and find that temperatures seemingly plateaued or even cooled, but stitch them together, and you get an stairway up. In the bigger picture it is just the usual natural variance in a constantly rising temperature graph. "The phrase Global Warming was replaced by Climate Change." Replaced? These terms do not even mean the same thing, so why would you believe one replaced the other ...? _Global Warming_ (GW) refers to the observed rise in global average temperatures, while (anthropogenic) _Climate Change_ (CC) means the change in globe wide climate, which includes a lot more than just temperature. Also, both terms are used in literature before the 2000s. You could check this yourself with any search engine cataloging scientific papers, like google scholar, science direkt or others. Just to help you, this is a paper from 1956 talking about climate change: _The Carbon Dioxide Theory of Climatic Change_ ; Gilbert N. Plass (1956); Tellus VIII, 2 ; doi:10.1111/j.2153-3490.1956.tb01206.x <-- I hope you know how to use a DOI-adresse. But there actually was a change in use of terms. Till the seventies of the last century there was another term used instead of/parallel to CC meaning the same thing, _inadvertent climate modification_ . Then an apt name, but soon it was changed since the knowledge about earth's climate grew and noone in his right mind could claim the changes were "inadvertent", when everyone (in a position to do something about it) knew that rising CO2 levels would change our climate. I would have called it _negligent climate modification_ instead, though. "the climate scare starting about a quarter of a century ago." a scare? not really. More importantly, it started *five quarters* of a century ago ... seriously, we know of this for 125 years now, not 25. At least the global warming part. Svante Arrehnius calculated the effect of extra CO2 in earth's atmosphere and this paper of his he published in *1896* : _On the influence of carbonic acid in the air upon the temperature of the ground_ ; S. Arrhenius (1896); Phil. Mag. S.5, Vol. 41, N. 5; doi:10.1080/14786449608620846 . "Of course, the speaker has been debunked." lol, If you say so. After reading your comment I do not think you are a good source to base my judgment on. Actually, the video is quite good, just a bit simplified. You should watch it again and look up the scientific terms. Edit: a few corrections and changes.

It was a story about a village discovered after a glacier receded. Are you saying the earth was not warm back a thousand years ago? That would have support from the climate deniers, because the proof is the Hockey Stick. According to the Hockey Stick, climate stays the same and then CO2 caused warming. My opinion is that it's much more complex of a situation, here on Earth. For example, we can wonder, if we were curious, why this planet was warm back then. But, I was responding to your question, and I copy 'n' paste, " "All the predictions from the 80's did not even come close," which ones?" It's a bit unfair of you to require, after the fact, that this is only about climate change, since the present scare really took off in the 1990s. We've spent quite a lot of effort fretting about climate in the last century. In the 1950s, Aldous Huxley...not the same person who uses his moniker here,.... suggested people immigrate to Canada to respond to global warming. But, a decade or so later, scientists were fretting about global cooling. Then it changed back to global warming. When the temperatures didn't rise in conjunction with the rise in CO2 after the turn of this century, the phrase Global Warming was replaced by Climate Change. It's like watching a ping pong being batted back and forth. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oog7-KOtpEA&t=01m42s This link abover is an compelling lecture about climate, and the molecule CO2, which scientists know more about since the climate scare starting about a quarter of a century ago. Of course, the speaker has been debunked. Debunking is a process of guilt by accusation. It works wonderfully. But, still, this is an interesting lecture.

Politicians are despicable precisely because they give you straight answers when they shouldn't. If someone gives you a straight answer, then it's likely to be bullshit. If someone gives you a nuanced wishy-washy answer, then they're more likely being honest with you. Because reality, and our ability to understand it, is usually grey and murky, not black-and-white and clear. A used car salesman doesn't tell you, "Well, I can't really tell you how great this aspect of the car is, because I don't have the time or money to do a thorough inspection on each car, but my best estimate is..." A used car salesman tells you, "Oh yes, this car is in excellent condition, I can guarantee it." The used car salesman gives you a straight answer, and that's why he shouldn't be trusted.

Let me put in a relative context easy for the average American layman like you to understand, when you are eating your fiftieth cheeseburger for lunch you are getting calories which your body needs but since you have already eaten 49 you are going over and gaining extra weight instead. Carbon dioxide is essential at 160 ppm, like I said earlier it is currently at 400+. The extra carbon dioxide now can trap heat in the atmosphere, raise sea levels in the water, and suffocate cities and areas without trees. As to your second point about data, I am confused.

I also understand that these climate models are doing what they have been programmed to do. Do note, that he is not talking about the uncertainty in a computer model, but rather the results these (slightly) different models end up at. Say I'm trying to find the true value of Pi (3.14) and one model is doing 1 + Rand(1,3) and another one is doing 2 + Rand(0,2) they will with enough runs, both probably land on Pi being about 3.0. Can we conclude that Pi is 3 because the models converge on this number? Of course not. (He would mention that both models actually predict Pi as high as 4 but that's not likely). It is incorrect methodology - he knows it, but it is the only methodology they have - so he plays along.

Some of them can be infuriating, but others are quite sensible (same can be said of proponents). Some skeptics deny the science altogether – think it’s a hoax so scientists can get that sweet grant money, while others accept that we’re warming but don’t think it’s a big enough deal to warrant drastically changing our economy. I’m a proponent of the science of anthropogenic climate change, and due to its importance and uncertainty, support efforts to minimize emissions of greenhouse gases. However, I must admit that I find much of the mainstream media coverage of this issue to be reductive and irresponsible. I can understand why this type of coverage can fuel doubt in CC. They spend so much time talking about Greta Thunberg than experts in the field, because it’s the shiny new toy. But it looks like they’re desperate and reaching. I get it. It’s Economics 101 – give audience what they want, not what they need. The demand for entertainment exceeds the demand for education. It’s as true in adults as in children. A conversation like this would not be appreciated by most. There’s a reason why Pewdie pie has 2000 times the subs that Sabine does. Admittedly, I’m a bit jaded from interactions I’ve had on this topic. Most people don’t wish to do the work but want the easy answer (right or left). They are quick to form a strong opinion on the matter, despite their ignorance. I don’t even like it when people ask me, “do you believe in climate change?” It’s a malformed question. It should be, “Do you understand the science of anthropogenic climate change?” And then go from there. Afterall, we need to know the claim and evidence for the claim, before forming a strong argument either for or against it, right? I work with many conservatives. When the topic of climate change comes up, I just want to beat my forehead against the desk – I’ve heard arguments involving Al Gore, polar bear population increase, CO2 is only a small % of atmosphere, how the medieval warm period being was amazing, satellite data showing no temperature increase, etc, etc. But not one of them know how molecules absorb energy from light, or about the carbon cycle, hydrologic cycle, radiative-forcing components or paleoclimatology. They know about Milankovitch cycles, but do not know the time scales for those cycles. They have facts that are insulated from context - Facts used to muddy the water and cast aspersion on the integrity of individuals studying the field. There are skeptics who accept that the temperature is increasing largely due to human activity, but are concerned of the economic consequences that might arise from imposing excessive regulatory constraints, incommensurate to the level of risk. They fear a situation where the antidote is potentially worse than the ailment. I share some these concerns. But that’s all the more reason to speak to the individuals who give their life to studying, painstakingly analyzing, the various aspects of the climate system and not the bloviating media/political pundits who have ulterior motives. That’s all the more reason to get educated on some of the basic aspects of the physics underpinning this phenomenon, instead of sound bites (and yes, this includes the 97% number). Listen, scientists are human and have flaws. Group think can occur in any area of life (science is no different); for this reason, peer review and public discussions like what Dr.Hossenfelder is doing are vital to keep everyone honest and also to inform the public. I just wish it was more prevalent.	UCV07EMiJPTKn7oqF3HGOsGw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV07EMiJPTKn7oqF3HGOsGw	1	UgxAiW94uJgsitbhLvx4AaABAg	Learning with Suj

How do you think plants survived before the industrial revolution? If human civilization somehow stopped all CO2 emissions, CO2 levels would eventually drop down to the levels they were at prior to the industrial revolution, not lower. And it wouldn't be an instantaneous drop. I criticize Islam as much as your username implies you do, but you sound just as delusional as an antiscientific Islamist who denies evolution or the age of the Earth. Leave the criticism of Islam to those who aren't antiscientific, coming from you it's just hypocrisy.

But as you start to get to smaller scales of both space and time, then you are in effect moving away from &quot;climate&quot; and closer to &quot;weather&quot; ... and the predictability <i>shades</i> , as a continuum, likewise between the very predictable and the very unpredictable, ending at the opposite extreme (time on the scale of hundreds of kiloseconds, distances in tens of kilometers) in the usual &quot;50% chance of rain tomorrow&quot; forecasts we all know and love.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fkCo_trbT8&amp;t=6m51s">6:51</a> (@411 s) - those models are actually pretty impressive: they even got some of the finer spikes (look toward the right end) right. Yes there&#39;s a fair bit of variability but the trend is unmistakable and not one model nor the observations blatantly contradict that.

I'm an engineer and can get my clues from looking at those diagrams, and I find the averaged line disturbingly adequate for the past and present – and the overall trend is very clear.

On a temperature change of around 0.9 degrees, it is 0.4 degrees every time. So according to them, 50 years of warming or so. It means you can&#39;t say a model is relatively accurate before 50 years, and none of the models predicted on that time frame. In other words, it is inside the margin of errors. At this point, it seems that we simply don&#39;t know if they are accurate or not.	UC49ege8vBt4016lRDNI3pRw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC49ege8vBt4016lRDNI3pRw	0

I find it interesting that they all missed the hiatus in warming starting in 1998. I can find any result I want by merely "googling" the topic. Models have serious issues that limit their reliability. Measurement error, uncertainties related to solar energy, cloud cover impacts, and a lack of understanding of the relationship between CO2 and temperature. A large proportion of the warming that occurred in the 20th century occurred in the first half of the century, when the amount of anthropogenic CO2 in the air was one quarter of the total amount there now. The rate of warming then was very similar to the rate of warming recently. We can’t have it both ways. The current warming can’t be unambiguously caused by anthropogenic CO2 emissions if an earlier period experienced the same type of warming without the offending emissions. We don't have the necessary scientific evidence to be even close to certainty to anything related to climate. No amount of "googling" will change that.

Win	@KelliAnn Winkler Well actually it has increased considerably to 417 ppm as opposed to 350 ppm (i thought) some 50 years ago. And yes in part this is human industry related. The climate alarmists have a point on there. In itself 417 is historically not extremely high . 450 million years ago it was about a 10 fold. In contrast, 150 ppm is the absolute minimum for plants to survive. In itself Co2 pollution, like any human induced polltution is something we should avoid. The key thing however is that climate alarmists claim the current rise in temperature is caused by the CO2 increase. That's demonstratively NOT true. The holocene period demonstrates that despite lower CO 2 levels, temperatures were much high than today, dropping to the mini ice age of 1650. Moreover , over a very long periode (millions of years) there is proof that CO2 is actually a LAGGING indicator of temperature, meaning it follows (not causes!) the rise or fall of temperature on a much delayed interval. But bottom line, I am not against combatting CO2 but the current hype has no scientific base and is purely political motivated...

The 1st part being Co2 as a more effective refrigerant Gas ok sure that is true. 1b There is no physical law showing a "Stifling effect" of CO2 rising global temps. There is also minimal evidence as such since Co2 is clearly shown to FOLLOW temperature increase (forget the IPCC that shift data ~60 years it's trash) The best from research so far is that 1. CO2 has minimal forcing to zero it's more an asset than a problem. You base the assumption Co2 forces temperature it does not. 2. The ideal gas law trumps any "Scary predictions" and is proven to be correct by defining an additional mass to the overall atmosphere. 3. laws of heat transfer with solids vs gasses have contrived "forcing" by people I would like to see removed from science altogether. The SB constant suggests a solid surface behaves like a gas. It does not. 4. Ignoring all other factors is not science. 5. Ignorance. "will reach a tipping point and shutdown the thermohalid conveyor belt pushing warm equatorial waters to the north pole. Then because of higher CO2 levels, we will avoid another glacial period, which I think is a better occurrence" That ignorance is 2 fold. An effect you have been told in world salad format for a system you read as fact yet its proposed as an idea of a system and given a name. The 2nd part is what honestly dishonest people do when trying to sell an old broken car to an elderly couple. Please define these word salad systems because the actual science says the models are worthless since they ignore. AKA the models are as IGNORANT as the people that do not want to understand or learn. Frank I have hopes here for you since you are parroting crap. The ice melted a long time ago, it will ice over again a bit more than last time but hopefully if science and not the TV is in control be have a chance to worry about low crop yields around the corner.

UgxX47UE-iI1zvqBa1x4AaABAg.92Hcg5ILzDV9Cwh7Ltoi4-		0	2020-08-29 11:35:21	Frank Mueller	When speaking in terms of physical laws, there is a stifling effect of rising CO2 levels increasing global temperatures. As temperatures rise, even a little bit, the air is able to hold more moisture in it, and this change causes more turbulence which causes more clouds. Since the absorption of heat to this planet is greatest over the deep dark oceans and clouds reflect the most; the 2 buffer most of the rising CO2 temperature increase models predict. Then you have that rising sea levels from the last glacial period (technically it is not confirmed that we are out of the ice age) will reach a tipping point and shutdown the thermohalid conveyor belt pushing warm equatorial waters to the north pole. Then because of higher CO2 levels, we will avoid another glacial period, which I think is a better occurrence.

Or it's a sidestep since you are stating a belief because it's "Obvious" I am showing a position of AGW to be nothing as advertised and your opening point is that of ignoring every point I put forwards that no AGW is not a problem since there is a lack of evidence. At least list the papers that directly counter the arguments i make. If it's so "Obvious" it will be easy to do so. as for your interesting modelling potential, I am sure so long as you pop into your research some buzz words like 'AGW' or 'CAGW' or 'climate change' or 'CO2 and it's effect on....' (...being Insert some nonsense research here) Back to the point. You have not stated why your position is "It's obvious" the only "Obvious" thing so far is that you haven't presented points to counter my peer reviewed scientific research. Certified genius's know there is not a way to program with every complex variable. I mean this in a light hearted way but you should start´of with an Airfix model, they where popular in the 80's and you got to paint them how you wanted to. At least the ingredients are fixed, that one ends up with a spitfire, or the Bismarck and clearly distinguishable. Once you have nailed, paint away! add your artistic flair. But please stay away from science when I hear "Ignore" THAT is not a word of science. So please before the next made up data comes along that leaves out everything else to make is simpler to prove what you want it to, step back and let's discuss the trillions that have been spent so far on a big fat misunderstanding of spectrographic analysis, lack of empirical evidence that doesn't involve cherry picking time points and data sets for nicer hockey sticks (breath) AND data changed that mean 60% of what is presented is MADE UP! We are truly living in a simulation because this "Simulated" science is pretty shit. Actual observations and measurements are not.. It's warmed, Co2 has risen. And? send some money that people can make things up by ignoring all the other data because deep down they know it's not possible? 2 papers are showing how the current science is wrong. The earth is not a lab, the properties of CO2 are misused with misunderstanding. One shows the Molar mass version of the ideal gas law fits almost exactly to what is observable and some papers I already quoted about those parts of science you already ignore. https://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/New-Insights-on-the-Physical-Nature-of-the-Atmospheric-Greenhouse-Effect-Deduced-from-an-Empirical-Planetary-Temperature-Model.pdf https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324599511_Thermal_Enhancement_on_Planetary_Bodies_and_the_Relevance_of_the_Molar_Mass_Version_of_the_Ideal_Gas_Law_to_the_Null_Hypothesis_of_Climate_Change Correct me if I am wrong but in summary "I am not interested in AGW as that is obviously true" You are being ignorant. Earlier posts you seem to know much about the topic. There is of course an exit strategy too.

That's your argument all along. SO, I pointed out the ones missing. I pointed out the CO2 data used for nice hockey sticks is wrong, I pointed out that CO2 lags temperature. I've not said these cycles are the only points to consider either. If I can read the info for free, then show me a link that shows YOU have done your research since all my points Paul show the Paper and the link to that information....for Free! What's next? I jump through some hoops for a fish? Respectfully that is why there is a NIPCC a group of scientists that do not think CO2 is a problem as described to the public. If you want to counter my points (there are more) that CO2 is a real problem, then you have to back those argument up wit the papers that show it IS and NOT the many many peer reviewed papers that ASSUME it is. Many many children believe in Santa Claus, does it mean that because the majority think 1 guy in a suit can deliver presents to all the believers in a single 24hour period via a mechanism of magic is real and holds truth? NO because they are kids. ADULTS (some) are pretending to be kids again by agreeing that it got warmer and CO2 has risen therefore CO2 is the cause because 1 guy a long time ago got parts correct and other parts wrong. It's documented. At this point are you still claiming CO2 is the main reason for climate change? or have I shown you that this line of enquiry is severely flawed and lacking evidence? By all means base your arguments on counter papers to the science presented. That's what makes science better. Being ignorant of the parts you do not want to understand makes the people that call me a "Climate denier" look even more stupid when their arguments ultimately boil down to faith, ideology and a mind far far from the methods of science. I call them Science deniers. Now the "Movement" of popular idiots took that more impressive term and claim it as their own , since the original label for sceptics of the claims made that a trace gas is now going to be a BIG problem unless we all act to change CO2 amounts in the air...via taxes or penalties or face catastrophe. Lets rewind. For CO2 to be a problem all 3 of these have to be true: 1. Temperature must follow CO2, that CO2 drives global temperatures. 2. The ice core record must reflect what is in the atmosphere at that time. 3. Most or all of the recent CO2 must have been caused by us . Science shows not a single point is true so NO CO2 is not driving global temperatures. Suffering from group think is fine for lemmings because the concept of being right is more dominant than the view of the cliff. Ultimately the species survive because the minority are what define evolution by thinking differently. When lemmings are running science, it's time to take other appropriate action. Warm regards.

The closest models to reality are those that leave it out all together but they are also wrong. Kids and computers is a misuse of resources when the climate is far more complex than the "Forcing" they contrived by bastardizing Stefan Boltzmann (meant for solid surfaces) onto a gas! Then they contrived "Layers" in a system under constant flux...now starts the "Climb down" from the same people that sat behind the nonsense all along. They chose the majority side, not the scientific one. Sciecne looks at the for vs against arguents and that was lost as soon as people made a LOT of money, litterally from a trace gas we need more of as plant food for when the REAL emergency comes and it gets fucking cold and crops fail on a large scale!! The alarmist twats today will be the "Don't worry its colder and the ice is coming back so peace maaan" saying that the Green hippies of today will I hoope live long enough to remmember how less people die when it's warm than when they are old and dying in the cold. The last laugh is on the people they called "Climate deniers" that know more about it than their generation of group think social media TV junkies incapable of reading about the science (or lack of) behind the claims.

We can model trajectories to land men on the moon using Newtonian physics - which is not a perfectly accurate method. But it works - and works very well, because it's accurate enough. I actually write a lot of computer simulations in my professional life - and one thing I am acutely aware of is that a lot of approximations will give you results that are near indistinguishable from reality. It all depends on what you are trying to model. The more accurate we go, the better it will be, but we are already at a point that our models can predict climate to a high degree of certainty. We aren't suddenly going to go "Whoops - I guess climate change wasn't happening after all". Not going to happen.

Geological findings prove there is no such linear link as it was much warmer both 4000 and 2000 years ago, despite lower CO2 levels back than (or are you suggesting The ancient Romans also drove in huge diesel cars?) Sure I am with you that burning fossil fuels is a technology fitting for the 18th or 19th century, not the 21st. But knowingly scaring people with lies is neither scientifically nor morally acceptable. So I am all for renewables and if (as demonstrated) this is not enough despite billions in subsidies we should consider new and even safer fission energy in my opinion...for now, banning nuclear energy has lead to heavy polluting energy electricity power plants.

Win	@Paul Pukite Let's say it is very 'potent' indeed, but volume-wise in Earth's atmosphere it is still rather insignificant (0,04% of our atmosphere is CO2, and causes only a few percent of the NATURAL GH effect) ). When asked, the average person thinks it makes up a quarter of our atmosphere, and the governments are doing nothing to correct this unnecessary scare. Why? because thy like it this way! By intentionally misleading people to think CO2 is directly linked to the rising temperature (we are coming out of a mini ice age form the mid 1750's) people are made to believe they are the cause and that therefor it is just they pay trillions in extra taxes (which will not make ad difference, other then have government save public pensions).

He seems to discuss that CO2 development is being captured in math models and how much uncertainty there is in it. The 'devious' part of course that he is implicitly saying that Co2 (which CAN indeed be linked in part to human activity for sure!!!) effects global temperature. This is not true. CO2 is far more a lagging than leading indicator of global warming. Recent history has shown beyond the shadow of a doubt there were much higher temperatures both 2000 and 4000 years ago, with far LOWER CO2 levels. By trying to couple CO2 to Global heating the UN/EU tries to scare people into giving up their democratic rights and pay more taxes. It is a sinister yet very effective plot. People trust science and are deceived...Such is live....It is a shame that Sabine lends her status to this goal....Just sad. But hey, who's perfect...

In fact, if you are not above a little curve fitting they are inevitable products of modelling. Even linear models with an unconstrained input will inevitably lead to such outcomes. It tells you nothing whatsoever about the climate, past, present or future. It is just an artifact of your method. The fact that the models all show the same output artifact is evidence only of the consensus of the linear modelling approach they all use. The simple fact is that there is no evidence for such runaway effects on the basis of CO2 changes in the empirical record.

He is not questioning the accuracy of models of how much global temperatures will rise. Start listening from 27:49. "Now the one thing that climate models have been quite unequivocal about is actually that if we continue to emit CO2 as we are doing now, and as we have done, then by 2100 although we can say that the most likely amount of global warming might be 3 or 4 degrees, we know from these ensembles of integrations that there is a tail which goes out to more than that, could go out to 6 or 7 or even more than that degrees. *_Now, again, 6, 7, I don't know if that sounds a lot, but for anyone who knows their climatology, that really is catastrophic."_* So, in other words, there's very little chance that climate change will be less catastrophic than the consensus predictions. There is a greater than little chance that climate change will be more catastrophic than the consensus predictions. And if 6 or 7 degrees increase is obviously catastrophic, I don't imagine that the 3 or 4 degrees increase of the consensus is something to casually dismiss, either.

In astrophysics, we are able to look backward in time owing to the speed with which light traverses the universe; that allows us to collect comprehensive data about changes over time stretching back billions of years. In climate science, we have only been collecting comprehensive data on a global scale for changes over the last four decades. Proxy data about prehistoric climate changes, while intriguing, is not sufficient to serve as a basis for climate modeling. There appear to be cyclic changes in the climate that occur over the span of decades, centuries, and millennia; we may need to collect comprehensive data for several centuries to gain sufficient understanding of those cycles to form meaningful climate models.

What humanity needs is a plan B, to transition to anti fragile systems. I would agree with you, we have no viable alternative energy source based on the current levels of consumption. Industries and commerce need to become more sustainable in their energy usage. Solar and battery storage can effectively take care of residential usage. But you are correct, there will still be a deficiency. Fusion power is still too far away. We need more research into viable forms of nuclear such as thorium or molten salt reactors, to get us by until long term sustainable energy production such as fusion is usable. Switching from fossil fuel to electric vehicles will help, though this will then increase the demand on electricity grids, particularly during nighttime hours when solar and wind can’t provide. We need to look into alternative forms of storage such as gravity based systems which shift some kind of load using collected energy, then release the load to generate energy when required.

At present, we do not have any low-cost energy sources that can replace fossil fuels; to suggest that wind and solar can fill the gap is sheer fantasy. Nuclear power has potential but has high startup costs and faces public resistance. Were we to simply cut back on fossil fuel use without an adequate replacement, the cost of food in the developed nations would skyrocket, as would the cost of heating homes in winter. Hundreds of millions of people would experience a sharp decline in their standard of living, disproportionately impacting the poorest and most vulnerable members of society. Human civilization can adapt, yes, but not at the pace that would be required to meet the IPCC’s goals.

Cons, humanity needs to change its wasteful ways and start taking care of the planet, not abusing it and stripping it of resources. Industries and economics will have to change. On the plus side, we get to remain in a sustainable and habitable environment which we rely on and which is supporting all life on earth. Is we DONT do anything what are the pros and cons. Pros, we get to keep doing what we are doing, stripping the planet of resources and not living sustainably. Cons, we won’t have a habitable environment to sustain the current population, populations will need to migrate to more habitable areas, making resources more scarce, likely war will break out over resources and habitable zones, we will continue to suck the coal and oil resources until we reach a point where there is not enough supply and there will be a vertical drop in supply, as we are sent back to the Stone Age. Bottom line, humans are great at adaptation, we can handle a few changes in order to ensure we have a stable and sustainable planet. Status quo’s will need to change, nothing is set in stone, but for the good of our children and grandchildren, and future generations, this needs to happen, unless we want to turn all those post apocalyptic movies into reality.

About an hour later with no wind, high level clouds formed overhead. Not long after, I noticed the temperature rise, perhaps about 1-2 degrees.<br /> My point is that CO2 did not trap enough heat radiated from the Earth to overcome radiational cooling once the sun went down under clear skies, which caused the temperature to drop. However, the formation of high level clouds significantly overwhelmed radiational cooling by trapping noticeable heat from the Earth resulting in a rise in temperature.<br />It is reasonable to believe from this test that CO2 is not even close to being a strong greenhouse gas that can trap heat to affect our weather............it provided no noticeable warming and allowed cooling to predominate in the absence of clouds<br />All temperatures were read off of my car&#39;s outside thermometer with the car parked at the same location for about 1 and 1/2 hours	UCUSq-TyoXHgOAt7swGYSPyw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUSq-TyoXHgOAt7swGYSPyw	0

Ugwc0ZTbC449pn4E8Yp4AaABAg	1	0	2019-12-08 02:59:39	grindupBaker	<b>*</b> PART 1 OF 3 <b>*</b> <br />This is how the so-called &quot;greenhouse effect&quot; in Earth&#39;s troposphere causes warming. The so-called &quot;greenhouse effect&quot; effect is nothing at all like the effect that warms a greenhouse. A vast &quot;shimmer&quot; of transverse electromagnetic radiation (TER) in the long-wave band (LWR) is caused by molecules of water vapour (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (NO2) and some other gases in the troposphere due to their collisions (averaging 2,700,000,000 collisions / second) with other molecules, which are almost always going to be nitrogen (N2) or oxygen (O2) because they are almost all of the gas quantity in the troposphere. The H2O, CO2, CH4, NO2 and some other gases are being called &quot;greenhouse gases (GHGs)&quot; because the overall effect (not just this part) ends up causing warming of Earth&#39;s troposphere. All except H2O are called &quot;well-mixed greenhouse gases&quot; because their boiling and freezing points are so low that they don&#39;t condense or freeze in the troposphere, not even near the top, so they get spread out well mixed around Earth and well mixed vertically in the troposphere. The well-mixed GHGs now punch above their weight compared with water vapour (H2O) because the upper half of the troposphere is so cold that almost all H2O forms on dust/salt particles in liquid or solid form there rather than being a GHG but the others remain as GHGs. The lowest quarter or so of the troposphere where it&#39;s warmer and water vapour (H2O) is king is already highly &quot;saturated&quot; without much additional &quot;enhanced greenhouse effect&quot; possible (still, H2O has such a broad absorption band that it still manages to match CO2 pretty much exactly 1:1 net as a 100% +ve feedback).<br />------------------<br />The GHG molecules don&#39;t emit a photon (LWR unit) of LWR when they collide and they don&#39;t later get to emit a photon of LWR after every collision, only after a few of them (note 1). What happens is that a collision might cause a GHG molecule to vibrate in a certain way (so with a certain energy) of which the GHG molecule has the capability of any one of a selection (called its &quot;vibrational modes&quot;). GHG molecules with more vibrational modes are more powerful GHGs because they have a broader absorption/emission band. The GHG molecule now has &quot;molecular vibrational energy (MVE)&quot; if the collision did cause it to vibrate. Energy cannot be created without destroying matter and matter doesn&#39;t get destroyed by this. What happens is that one or both of the two molecules slows down such that the total &quot;molecular translational energy (MTE)&quot;, aka &quot;molecular kinetic energy&quot;, aka &quot;heat&quot;, is reduced by precisely the same amount as the MVE that the GHG molecule acquired, so (m1*v1**2 + m2*v2**2)/2 after collision is less than (m1*v1**2 + m2*v2**2)/2 before collision because either v1 or v2 or both was reduced, thus obeying the Law Of Conservation Of Energy. Effectively, the temperature of the 2 colliding molecules was reduced by an energy amount equaling the MVE that the GHG molecule acquired, what happened was energy transmutation from one form to another. When this vibrating GHG molecule hits another molecule it loses its vibration (note 1) and one or both of the two molecules speeds up such that the total MTE, aka &quot;heat&quot;, is increased by precisely the same amount as the MVE that the GHG molecule lost. So it just moved speed/heat from one N2 or O2 (almost always) molecule to another. However, ==here we go==, very occasionally/rarely and not very often at all compared with the 2,700,000,000 collisions / second that happen to this GHG molecule (note 2) the GHG molecule with MVE will spontaneously emit a photon of LWR and lose its MVE. Now it has converted one-photon&#39;s-worth of &quot;heat&quot; in the troposphere to one photon of LWR. It has cooled the troposphere by one-photon&#39;s-worth of &quot;heat&quot; (one molecule is now in a global Mini Ice Age ?).<br />------------------<br />LWR is also radiated from the surfaces of liquids &amp; solids such as the surface of the ocean, the surfaces of water droplets in spray above the ocean, the surfaces of water droplets in clouds, the surfaces of any water droplets at all, the land surface, the surfaces of trees &amp; grass, the skins of animals, the surfaces of dust, salt, volcanic ash, any ash and any surface whatsoever on the ocean or land or in the troposphere. Except for 10% of this LWR whose photons happen to have wave-lengths in a band called &quot;the atmospheric window&quot; this LWR goes into the vast &quot;shimmer&quot; of LWR in the troposphere with a distribution of energy quantity at each wave-length in the LWR band that you&#39;ve all seen hundreds of plots of all over the place.<br />------------------<br />GHG molecules also absorb LWR provided that the photon&#39;s energy (which is its wave-length) perfectly matches one of that GHG molecule&#39;s MVE mode energies and the photon goes through (or tries to go through) the area of the GHG molecule that absorbs that wave-length (obvious example, CO2 isn&#39;t at all fussy what part of its molecule a photon of wave-length 15.00 microns goes through, it&#39;ll swallow it and vibrate). Obviously, a GHG molecule neither knows nor cares whether a photon of a certain wave-length trying to go through it was emitted by the surface of the ocean, the surfaces of water droplets in spray above the ocean, the surfaces of water droplets in clouds, the surfaces of any water droplets at all, the land surface, the surfaces of trees &amp; grass, the skins of animals, the surfaces of dust, salt, volcanic ash, any ash and any surface whatsoever on the ocean or land or in the troposphere, or emitted by another GHG molecule (H2O, CO2, CH4, NO2 and any other GHG molecule) because all photons of the same wave-length are the same. A GHG molecule with MVE that it got by absorbing LWR can, of course, ==here we go again==, very occasionally/rarely and not very often at all compared with the 2,700,000,000 collisions / second that happen to this GHG molecule (note 2) spontaneously emit a photon of LWR and lose its MVE. In this case the GHG molecule transmuted LWR back to LWR, it transmuted a photon to an identical photon, so it did nothing at all other than change the direction in which the photon is going. This is the cartoon that scientists show the public because it&#39;s a simple analog that Earth tried to cool itself to space and failed, but since there are 2,700,000,000 collisions / second there&#39;s just about a bat&#39;s chance in hell that the GHG molecule will spontaneously emit a photon of LWR and lose its MVE before it collides and loses its MVE (note 1). The coal/oil shills use the highly-incorrect nature of this ludicrously-over-simplified cartoon to &quot;disprove&quot; the physics theory but it isn&#39;t the physics theory that&#39;s incorrect, it&#39;s the cartoon that&#39;s incorrect. It doesn&#39;t describe the physics theory hardly at all as I&#39;ve explained in detail above. This is why I dislike this cartoon. When a vibrating GHG molecule hits another molecule it loses its vibration (note 1) and one or both of the two molecules speeds up. This means that &quot;heat&quot; increased, what happened was energy transmutation from one form to another, energy transmutation from LWR to &quot;heat&quot; with MVE as the intermediary step.

Ugwsk8H4AZLN31W3Ug54AaABAg	0	0	2019-12-08 02:58:52	grindupBaker	<b>*</b> PART 2 OF 3 <b>*</b> <br />Now the so-called &quot;enhanced greenhouse effect&quot; explanation that I think is clearest, obvious and difficult to challenge by mis-direction disinformation and subterfuge per the memes concocted by the coal/oil shills. 17% of the LWR that Earth sends to space is emitted by the ocean or land surface because the photons are in a wave-length band called &quot;the atmospheric window&quot; that doesn&#39;t get absorbed by the GHGs. It&#39;s my understanding that this will narrow slightly with increased GHGs, but this isn&#39;t the prime &quot;enhanced greenhouse effect&quot; and I&#39;m not addressing any additional warming it might cause. 83% of the LWR that Earth sends to space is emitted by the GHG molecules in the troposphere, tropopause and stratosphere (note 2). This 83% of the LWR is the part that gets reduced by increased tropospheric GHGs and causes an energy imbalance with insufficient energy going out, which causes global warming, ocean heating and ice fusion, which causes climate change, which causes a variety of nuisances that I haven&#39;t studied. <br />------------------<br />The troposphere has an upper and a lower surface. The upper surface is the top of the troposphere (the tropopause) and the lower surface is the surface of the ocean or land. LWR produced in the troposphere that reaches the lower surface will warm that surface so it stays in Earth&#39;s ecosphere but LWR produced in the troposphere that reaches the upper surface has a good chance to make it through the increasingly-thin tropopause, stratosphere and the ultra-thin extended atmosphere to space and be energy lost to Earth&#39;s ecosphere, thus cooling it. LWR reaching the upper/lower surfaces was produced by GHG molecules, the surfaces of water droplets and the surfaces of solid particles (sea salt, ash, dust) throughout the troposphere sending photons upwards/downwards as described in detail earlier. <br />- There is an average altitude in the troposphere of the LWR quantity that reaches space. If you could float at this altitude and watch/count photons with special eye balls and brain you&#39;d see 50% of those photons that reach space are heading up from below you. If you counted it at 48% then you&#39;d need to float upward to get more of the LWR photon production below you. If you counted it at 52% then you&#39;d need to float downward to get more of the LWR photon production above you. This is obvious. When you float to the place where 50.0000000% of those photons that reach space are heading up from below you then you are at the average altitude in the troposphere of the LWR quantity that reaches space.<br />- There is an average altitude in the troposphere of the LWR quantity that reaches the surface of the ocean or land. You could float and find that the same way as the preceding.<br />These 2 altitudes in the troposphere are approximately for illustration only and as a global average (I&#39;m not quantifying the so-called &quot;enhanced greenhouse effect&quot; in this comment, only describing its operation accurately):<br />---- average --- ---- average global ----<br />---- altitude --- ---- temperature ----<br />6,600 metres -29.75 degrees 50% of the &quot;shimmer cloud&quot; of LWR photons that will make it to the tropopause are emitted by GHG molecules and the surfaces of cloud droplets and atmospheric particles below this altitude.<br />1,650 metres 3.7 degrees 50% of the &quot;shimmer cloud&quot; of LWR photons that will make it to the surface of the ocean or land are emitted by GHG molecules and the surfaces of cloud droplets and atmospheric particles below this altitude.<br />These values are approximate. They are to demonstrate how the so-called &quot;enhanced greenhouse effect&quot; works, not to provide quantities. They are approximately correct though. They are based on a global average ~12,000 metres height of the troposphere but it varies geographically from 9,000 to 16,000 metres. <br />---------------<br />If tropospheric GHGs are increased then 2 changes occur per my explanations above since the start of my comment:<br />1) More LWR than before is produced by the GHGs, and<br />2) More LWR than before is absorbed by the GHGs because the LWR photons have to make it through more GHG molecules that might absorb them before they can reach their goal of going up past the top of the troposphere or going down past the bottom of the troposphere and being absorbed into the ocean or land.<br />Note that I have not included &quot;(3) The LWR photons emitted by the surface of the ocean and land have to make it through more GHG molecules that might absorb them before they can reach space&quot; because I&#39;m dealing with the 83% of the LWR reaching space that&#39;s created by GHG molecules in the troposphere obtaining, then losing, MVE with spontaneous photon emission caused. I&#39;m not dealing with the 17% of the LWR in a wave-length band called &quot;the atmospheric window&quot; that gets directly to space after being emitted by the surface of the ocean and land. If that 17% is reduced by increased tropospheric GHGs (I&#39;m not sure) then that&#39;s an additional, unrelated, means of the so-called &quot;enhanced greenhouse effect&quot; (there&#39;s no particular reason why there has to be only one mechanism). <br />---------------<br />The result of combined effects/changes (1), (2) above is that the average altitude in the troposphere of the LWR quantity that reaches the top of the troposphere gets higher, so perhaps it raises from the 6,600 metres to 6,700 metres (as an example). Also, the LWR quantity is reduced slightly (the so-called &quot;enhanced greenhouse effect&quot;) for reason of the tropospheric temperature lapse rate explained below.<br />---------------<br />Likewise, identically, the average altitude in the troposphere of the LWR quantity that reaches the surface of the ocean or land gets lower, so perhaps it lowers from the 1,650 metres to 1,550 metres (obviously, it depends on the change quantity. I just showed a random example) because it has to get past more GHG molecules that might absorb the photon.<br />---------------<br />In either case GHG photons were trying to reach their goal of the top or bottom of the troposphere but now there are more GHGs in the way so it needs, == on average ==, to be a bit closer to make it. So that&#39;s why the &quot;cloud&quot; of LWR that will reach the top is a higher cloud than before and the &quot;cloud&quot; of LWR that will reach the bottom (ocean or land) is a lower cloud than before<br />---------------<br />The tropospheric temperature lapse rate is required to cause the so-called &quot;enhanced greenhouse effect&quot;. <br />The average altitude for LWR to space got higher (6,600 metres ---&gt; 6,700 metres in my example) which means LWR to space is from colder (slower) molecules on average because tropospheric temperature decreases with altitude and LWR to space is from higher-up-than-before molecules on average, so there are fewer GHG molecular collisions / second which leads to less MVE which leads to less LWR production. The quantity of LWR energy (power flux) provided by a mass of gas is proportional to its temperature(Kelvin)**4 (to the fourth power) so, as explained in detail above, the increasing of tropospheric GHGs ==must== cause less LWR than before to be passing upwards through the top of the troposphere.<br />That&#39;s the upper end of how the so-called &quot;enhanced greenhouse effect&quot; works.

Ugw7KSCB7s65cmovXyV4AaABAg	2	1	2019-12-08 02:57:14	grindupBaker	<b>*</b> PART 3 OF 3 <b>*</b> <br />The tropospheric temperature lapse rate is required to cause the so-called &quot;enhanced greenhouse effect&quot;. <br />The average altitude for LWR to ocean and land got lower (1,650 metres ---&gt; 1,550 metres in my example) which means LWR to the surface of the ocean and land is from warmer (faster) molecules on average because tropospheric temperature decreases with altitude and LWR to ocean/land is from lower-down-than-before molecules on average, so there are more GHG molecular collisions / second which leads to <br />more MVE which leads to more LWR production. The quantity of LWR energy (power flux) provided by a mass of gas is proportional to its temperature(Kelvin)**4 (to the fourth power) so, as explained in detail above, the increasing of tropospheric GHGs ==must== cause more LWR than before to be passing downwards to the surface of the ocean and land. This latter is called &quot;downwelling LWR radiation at the <br />surface&quot; and I&#39;ve explained why it must increase and this must, of course, warm the land and ocean surface. <br />That&#39;s the lower end of how the so-called &quot;enhanced greenhouse effect&quot; works. <br />--------- <br />Note 1: I haven&#39;t yet found the collision MVE production &amp; destruction spectra so I don&#39;t know what %age make MVE and what %age destroy MVE. I looked a few hours 4 years ago but couldn&#39;t find it (not for free anyway). It makes no difference to the description of the mechanism above but it would be needed to confirm the quantity of effect for doubling CO2.<br />Note 2: I&#39;ve read on the internet that spontaneous emission of a photon of LWR by a GHG molecule with MVE will typically occur after ~1.0 seconds with MVE but I&#39;m not accepting that without some serious fact checking which I haven&#39;t done yet. One photon / second just seems way too minuscule to me. I also need that information to calculate whether mis-calibration method of the STAR MSU/AMSU instrument makes the RSS &amp; UAH TLT temperature O2 proxy analyses analyse a significantly lower total of energy than thermometers measure, or whether the difference is negligible. It makes no difference to the description of the mechanism above. <br />Note 3: 80% of Earth&#39;s atmosphere is in the troposphere (the top of which is 16 km in the tropics and 9 km in the polar regions, averaging ~12,000 metres). The &quot;greenhouse effect&quot; warming can only happen in Earth&#39;s troposphere, there&#39;s no effect in Earth&#39;s tropopause and the effect is &quot;backwards&quot; in Earth&#39;s stratosphere with =increased= stratospheric GHG gases causing =cooling= of the stratosphere because the <br />stratospheric temperature lapse rate has temperature increasing with altitude (that&#39;s how it&#39;s known with total certainty that it&#39;s increased &quot;greenhouse gases (GHGs)&quot; doing the global warming for the last several decades). Since there&#39;s no temperature lapse rate in the tropopause then any change in the quantity/type of GHGs in the tropopause cannot have any warming or cooling effect on the tropopause or the <br />entire atmosphere, ocean or land. No effect at all. If you follow my description of the effect above for the troposphere but apply it to the tropopause then you&#39;ll clearly see that any change in the quantity/type of GHGs in the tropopause cannot have any warming or cooling effect That&#39;s the reality. The increasing GHGs in the stratosphere are a slight -ve feedback to global warming because downwelling LWR radiation <br />from the stratosphere decreases with increased GHGs, but it&#39;s a very slight -ve feedback because only 6.3% of the well-mixed GHGs (and all molecules) are above the tropopause and they are initially colder than the average of the troposphere so they make even less LWR than the 6.3% factor. By the time the stratosphere warms more than the average of the troposphere there&#39;s only 0.4% of Earth&#39;s atmosphere&#39;s <br />molecules above, negligible. <br />Note 4: FTIR power flux vs wave-length spectra recorded by the instrument on a satellite show which wave-lengths of LWR heading to space past the satellite came from the surface of the ocean and land and which wave-lengths came, on average, from the GHG molecules and surfaces of solid particles and water droplets in the atmosphere. From this atmospheric physicists have calculated the 83% of the LWR that <br />Earth sends to space that is emitted by the atmosphere rather than by the surface of the ocean and land. Also, the MODTRAN tool on the internet can be used to play with a theoretical calculation of the FTIR power flux vs wave-length spectra by adjusting GHGs.<br />Edit: 2019-12-15 from &quot;downwelling LWR radiation from the stratosphere increases with increased GHGs&quot;<br />to &quot;downwelling LWR radiation from the stratosphere decreases with increased GHGs&quot; <br />I mistyped that word backwards.

Listen to what Palmer points out at the end of the video. Climate change is going to cause an exponential increase in Third World migration to the West, the exact thing that the right is most afraid of. If D R is right and the left is about "White Man Bad", then the left should be climate change deniers, hoping that we continue pumping out CO2, raising climate catastrophe in the Third World and pushing left-voting immigrants into Western nations. And the right should be the political wing which is most in favor of limiting CO2 emissions, because CO2 emissions are going to be what "destroy Western nations" by rising global temperature and driving immigrants into richer nations. And yet the case is the opposite. The left wants to combat climate change, despite the accusations from the right that the left favors increased migration because immigrants can be expected to vote for leftwing leaders. The right doesn't want to combat climate change, despite the fact that it's going to cause a massive increase of nonwhite immigration into historically-white nations. How do you explain that? The explanation is that the left isn't willing to deny science, and that the right is more detached from reality. Or, perhaps the rightwing elites and media figures know that climate change will push more immigrants into Western countries, and thinks that's a good thing because it will get their xenophobic base more riled up to do their bidding.

And the thing about magnetism? It is the &quot;key&quot; that opens the climate &quot;lock.&quot;<br /><br />Temperature and CO2 are not relevant. Why? Because biology says it&#39;s actually important for plant life on Earth. So CO2 is not the problem. Temperature should be looked at for what it is: A measurement of heat energy. How many scientists recall this basic fact: That it takes 1 calorie of heat to raise 1 cubic centimeter of water, 1° C.<br /><br />But for the macro scale of Earth, the amount of heat we have is directly related to the UV and microwave radiation we get from the sun, which varies because of the strength of the EM field, our distance from the sun + axial tilt (Milankovitch Cycles), and the degree of solar output of radiation, indicated by sunspot activity.<br /><br />Again: If you don&#39;t understand magnetism in the climate equation, you understand nothing.

But also, yes, to simply claim that climate scientists probably never think about magnetism is stupid. You seem to be an example of the Dunning-Kruger effect. You have learned a little bit about the subject and from that limited information you have, you asses that you are an expert who knows almost everything there is to know. There is a reason why to become a climate scientist you have to do years of studying at university and not just a bit of "digging into this issue". I am just saying what is most probable. You can believe whatever you want. You are nobody.	UCTA3peKrDGvOyntMMSRejyA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTA3peKrDGvOyntMMSRejyA	1	Ugzcb_B0gFHBtaMNYYp4AaABAg	Isaiah Welch

Honestly, do you believe that such a piece of a complex puzzle could not be missed? Especially among people who may not even have magnetism as part of their discipline? Frankly, the fact you discount the merits of what I've said tells me everything I need to know about what you believe -- because you honestly sound like the same kind of person who, in 1905, would have discounted Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, or someone who would not believe Tesla's work during the Power Wars. And yes, I do think scientists have missed this important component, because if you were to ask any competent climatologist if anyone understands how and why climate changes, they will all say nobody does. Which means that the mechanics are not understood, which means nobody at the current time knows climate mechanics. All they know are two things: A) That climate change has occurred, and will continue to occur; and B) That the answers of how and why these changes occur have not been found. And the thing about Occam's Razor? As here, the only application that would apply is that no theory has a simple answer, because without an understanding of the mechanics, you cannot check mechanical hypotheses against other known laws of science, and other scientific facts. And since we know magnetism is one of the four known fundamental forces of nature, not to mention our planet uses magnetism to protect the surface from deadly amounts of radiation that would kill us -- yet, this same field lets through just enough radiation to maintain a stable biodome environment that lets life flourish on the surface. In that context, the role of magnetism needs to be taken into account, and it's not. Because of this massive hole in how magnetism plays a role in climatology, it's no wonder that there is no actual simple answer. And since the EM field is part of this planet's life equation, then it must also be part of the climate equation as well. Otherwise, no model, using flawed data, will be able to explain what will happen in the future, as a model is supposed to do -- because inherently, a lack of mechanical understanding of the climate means that all theories are inherently flawed, inconsistent, and unsound, and perhaps even invalid, as AGW now is. And AGW is invalid because other disciplines and other factual certainties rebut the theory prima facie. And those in Greta's camp, or AOC's camp, will never admit this, because it would destroy the very reason for why they are pushing for something that would fundamentally change our society, as such reason invariably gives them more power and enslaves the rest of society by removing free will and autonomy. This is a direct violation of the Law of Best Intentions, which is then used to implement a global Virtual Panopticon. And since such a position is anti-human, anti-life, is inhumane, immoral, and unethical, then I most oppose the theory of AGW, and those who support an invalid theory.

What is more likely, that you - a random person on the internet - are a genius who is the only one who has thought about geo-magnetism which the entire scientific community for some reason simply forgot about, or that you are simply missing something about the climate models which were created by many many different people who are on average smarter than you?

As I've seen, when over 20 different disciplines are needed to understand climate mechanics, it is highly improbable that the solutions put forth are anything but simple -- because most evidence creates more questions than answers. And if the "science was settled," and "there no longer is any debate," why are there more questions than answers? The science itself, if we actually understood it, would be simple -- but it's not. And part of the problem is that not all variables are being taken into account. And the thing is, climate scientists are trying to understand the output of all the variables without understanding the mechanics -- and thinking this approach is valid. It's not. This approach is like trying to cure a disease by only considering the symptoms, when a fundamental understanding of anatomy and physiology is needed. And doing that doesn't work in medicine, and it won't work for climatology. Because it is not consistent across science as a whole.

The models, if they can be called that, A) Are flawed, and do not account for every variable, and B) geo-magnetism must be accounted for, because magnetism is one of the four fundamental forces of the universe. I don't know what the "electric universe" theory is, so I can't say if it holds water or not. But what I do know is that Nikola Tesla is right: Everything in the universe, from atomic theory to black holes, relies upon some form of frequency, vibration, and energy. And in the case of climate change, in order to understand the whole picture and understand the mechanical aspect of how and why climate change happens, an understanding of magnetism must be part of the climate equation. Otherwise, you act like someone who uses a car, who thinks they can fix the car when it breaks down, all the while you fail to understand how or why the car runs the way it does. And climate change cannot be approached in this manner, which is why any climate model, to be accepted, has to be able to predict what lies ahead to some degree, and no model can. Weather predictions are more accurate than almost every climate model there is.

How could anyone do anything without estimating at every step, including random events?  And all events are random, and the only question is whether any of the events are the rare and unique "fat tail" events. Have you never driven anywhere? Every trip from A to B IS a trip from A to C to D to E to F to G to H ... and finally to B. Millions of events ARE occurring between each of those points. Yet, miraculously most of the time we actually go from A to B without even noticing. And I'm absolutely certain I can give an accurate time of arrival.

You don't need decimal point accuracy for global understanding and prediction. Predictions of global climate change today is good enough. Precision is not necessary. A chaotic system is predictable -- and is typically only chaotic at the local level and highly predictable overall. The more precise one attempts to predict the worse the result. For example, I live in Madison WI. I frequently travel to Milwaukee WI, a distance of ABOUT 90 miles. I know it's ABOUT an 1 1/2 drive. I need ABOUT one hour account for traffic, parking, walking. Traffic is a chaotic system: accidents, traffic jams, road construction, other events like the State Fair, sports events, parade events, etc. I have a long history of driving to Milwaukee -- I've got a 50 year history here. Yet, I do not need to have any more accuracy than ABOUT to wholly predict the outcome of the trip. It's not important to predict to the minute when I will arrive -- plus or minus 10 minutes is good enough. Climate Change predictions are the same -- it's good enough and has been for decades.

The scale of the modelling required for global coverage is the challenge, and that is, as Palmer said clearly, a problem of supercomputing. The "chaotic" element of translating a change in global average to regional effects is where you are left some room for FUD. But that room is shrinking.

I call bullshit because if the situation were as dire as it is claimed, a punative carbon tax in the free world would not be the solution. This is about power and control and smoke and mirrors and not science. These dire warnings about catastrophic warming and cooling have been wrongly predicted for centuries. Also if fossil fuel use is the cause of our doom, why are the powers contemplating the migration of 100&#39;s of millions north into the free world&#39;s colder climates where the fossil fuel use will need to increase dramatically??

Missing station data is made up. The measurements from stations with continuous records show that there is little in the way of warming since the 1930s and most is due to exposure to artificial heat sources. Most continental records took place BEFORE the 1950s. The satellite record shows no statistically significant warming for two decades. The US, which has the best data, shows no measured warming since the 1930s. Hansen&#39;s paper shows that the Arctic was warmer in the 1940s than it was in the 1990s. IPCC&#39;s FAR showed that Arctic ice cover was LOWER in the mid-1970s than in the 2000s. We have emails that discuss how papers that do not fit the narratives will be kept from the IPCC assessment. We have a pretty good theory about the link between solar activity, CRF, cloud cover, and temperatures. The models have failed. The observational record suggests a warming of 1.2 C per doubling, which is positive for human beings and the biosphere. Time to call out the fraud and move on.

I know it has increased but not significantly. If you respond please dont blow me up, I just have questions. Also we in the US could reduce CO2 emissions a lot (approximately 50%) by upgrading our antiquated electrical grid. Lastly, freon use has skyrocketed since refrigeration and comfort cooling were introduced in the middle of the century. Freon is a much more efficient greenhouse gas than CO2. Could there be a connection?	UCE4U99b86R2UcOHQz21BwaQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE4U99b86R2UcOHQz21BwaQ	1	Ugxoo1KXATDQ8ofEDX14AaABAg	AustNRail

And it didn&#39;t melt due to a few cavemen lighting their cook fires. The ice melted because of a global warming WHICH WAS CAUSED BY NATURE, NOT BY MAN. <br />That same natural warming may yet be occurring today. And if so it is still caused by nature, not by man. <br /> <br />Incidentally, why is nature-caused global warming an acceptable thing, but any putative man-caused warming a terrible thing?

They are likely proud people who would not appreciate that they are being lied to and used to spread the misinformation online. Their adherence to political ideology makes them vulnerable to misinformation they deem is valid because it comes from the other end of the political spectrum (which is does not, but making you believe that this science is "liberal" is sure to make you reject it).

If someone comes into my office saying there is a mistake somewhere in, say, the theory of relativity, I will listen to the arguments as to where the problem would be. I do not reply that I will NOT listen and am not interested because a majority of the scientists believe the theory is sound. Sure it is quite unlikely there would be a mistake but in physics at least, we are never really finished describing nature so I will always listen. BECAUSE sometimes it happen that the arguments ARE valid and then it may lead to ground breaking new discoveries. History shows that it often only takes a single brilliant person to change physics and then the world.

There is really no "debate" process, its a collection of reviews of published data and papers. You can call that a debate, but that doesnt make much sense. When it comes to reviews, it is done by people whom are actively publishing scientists and qualified. Finally, and this is a simplest aspect that a child could get, when most of the scientists involved in the studies agree, then the balance of probability is obviously high. Yet, adults are putting more weight on the oddities (1%). That is highly irrational and, to my original point, highly arrogant.

The idea that climate change (or indeed biological evolution) was a liberal idea seems to be specifically US American. It's definitely not the case for many other countries. Heck, even the Catholic Church accepted biological evolution long ago and they never had any position against climate change. It should really make you think if you consider an idea "liberal" which even the Catholic Church accepts. By the way, there is a simple argument why every layperson should believe the expert consensus if there is one. The probability that a layperson is wrong and the majority of experts is right is much greater than the probability that the majority of experts is wrong and the layperson is right. Why do I believe that the Earth has a solid iron core? Because this is consensus among geologists.

There's nothing liberal about that. There's something very twisted about your argument.

Historically the holozene optimum 8000 years ago was 3 degrees warmer, but the sahara and also the atacama were not deserts at this time but green landscapes with many lakes. So it is equally likely that the trend of reduced temperature difference between poles and equator may be very beneficial for mankind and nature. So why do we insist on maintaining the climate of 1850, which was the end of the Little Iceage?	UCpgJ2pPUrxklN3-TvAXZjaA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpgJ2pPUrxklN3-TvAXZjaA	0

At the same time scientists say the science is settled, which is definitely false after this interview, the agencies spend much more money on climate IMPACT than on climate RESEARCH. This confirms the impression, the goal is not to protect the world but to destroy the world. The bad consequences of decarbonization are not vage but very reliable, whereas the consequences of increased CO2 are quite unreliable.

As an example, right now, Australia is fighting one of the worst bushfires on history caused by yet again massive heatwave. Australia has been experiencing bushfires of increased frequency and intensity in the past 20 years. If you blame others of being disingenuous, then it is expected that you don't lie and spread disinformation. however, the comment above is a blatant lie. And that makes you, I guess, a liar.

So the models have to be fine-tuned, and that is a tedious task.<br /><br /><br />In this case, this is well-accepted. Noone expects perfect forecasts because everyone knows about the limitations of the models. But also noone doubts that the basic science behind weather is, at least, partially understood.<br />Why the scepticism about climate change then? This is basically the same thing on different scales. The principles are understood, the predictions are reasonably accurate, just not perfect. And they will never be. But it remains true and valid.

No reasonable, honest scientist would dare call any of the current climate models &quot;accurate&quot;. The models have all been embarrassing, ALWAYS substantially exaggerating the amount of warming. How would Palmer explain the periods in Earth&#39;s history when the atmospheric CO2 concentration was many times higher than now, at the same time that the Earth was much colder it is than today? And how would Palmer explain the periods in Earth&#39;s history when the atmospheric CO2 concentration was lower than now, at the same time that the Earth was much hotter than it is today? The fact that he intentionally ignores reality in his own field of study, including ignoring the intentional falsification and selective deletion of critical climate data in his own country, speaks volumes. Sabine, would you ignore proven falsification of data regarding the nature of photons, or the nature of dark matter, or the falsification of similar astronomical topics? Merely the fact that he is employed in this field in England, indicates his fraudulence - they would never tolerate any scientist who doesn&#39;t say that the Earth is not in imminent danger. For Palmer to not stress that the output from the IPCC is manufactured by ignorant, utterly corrupt politicians, and not by scientists, is very damning. For Palmer to not even mention the variability of the Sun&#39;s output and variabilities in the Earth&#39;s orbit, is also very damning. For Palmer to state at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fkCo_trbT8&amp;t=31m44s">31:44</a> that the forced mass migration into Europe and the U.S. was due to climate change , rather than a truly evil political plan by those nations&#39; leaders to institute a permanent, global, totalitarian communist government, was an extreme insult to all those who value the truth and freedom. And for Palmer to just assume, out of the clear blue sky and based on no evidence or reasoning what-so-ever, that the Earth being a few degrees hotter will be a net negative to mankind, rather than a net positive, is very damning. Everything this lying fraud says should be ignored. It is so very, very tiresome to repeatedly see jackasses like him being interviewed. Sabine asking, at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fkCo_trbT8&amp;t=21m50s">21:50</a>, &quot;So, what can be done about it?&quot; is such a disappointment. That question assumes a scientific reality that even Palmer admits is absolutely not known. Sabine, to your credit, you are so honest and logical that you have a hard time recognizing (or believing) how utterly corrupt the scientists and politicians are in the field of climate science. This is a fascinating example that even your iron-grip on scientific rationality can be corrupted. Please use the same level of scientific skepticism for climate science that you used when you analyzed the need for a larger supercollider. You are so much smarter than this.

That is why I am not ready to examine your idea at this time. But if you have a few references I would be glad to take a look. The driver that interests me is the change in cosmic ray flux in the lower atmosphere. A great overview was provided in a popular book called The Chilling Stars.

From a scientific point of view climate change was proven false the very first time a prediction failed. And don&#39;t buy the bullshit that you can measure the global mean, there are areas of the Earth larger than the USA that have no data. Nearly half of Africa has no data. Where there is no data they make the shit up. You can get models to do anything you want when you make up the data like these fraudsters do.

Also not the late C19th (just after the Little Ice Age ended) was 0.3 degrees BELOW average. Today we are 0.4 C above the value in late C19th. But we would be - they were exiting a 500 year cold period.<br /><br />Please can you explain how current thinking fits into the mini ice age v warm period fluctuations. I mean we had a warm period from AD 900 to AD 1300 and a cold period from AD 1300 to AD 1850. <br /><br />So while we are seeing warming, are the changes we see part of the natural cycle.

There might be some equilibrium threshold which (if crossed) results in a runaway further rise. Why even take the risk? I am worried however about the complete ineffectiveness and inefficiency of the world-wide measures promoted by NGO's and UN. It seems to me they are deliberately not taking effective steps. If we want to address this issue than we must invest in the 100 % safe MSR thorium nuclear technology as our future energy backbone. a MSR reactor was already running in the 60's until Nixon killed the initiate because the waste was so little and low on radioactivity they could not make weapons from it. That was the sole reason the dangerous uranium reactors where chosen as nuclear energy standard over the benevolent Thorium. Boy what a mistake. Beside nuclear as backbone, solar and to some extend wind could be the additional sources completing the top 3 power mix. But so far NGO's/UN are not going that way. In stead they spent huge amounts in counter productive measures such as cutting down and burning our forests ('biomass') or highly subsidized /low productive wind energy. What we should do is going 100% clean and safe nuclear, bringing down human growth rate (focusing on countries with the high rates of birth) combined with circular economy initiatives. I am hearing too little of it. Just spreading fake climate panic stories might be 'defendable' to spread the correct gospel but so far no effective measures are promoted, other than extra taxes and a totalitarian un democratic world government. Not good. Neither is locking up the entire world population over a virus that has only a fractional higher Infection Fatality Rate than the flue. If meant to reduce CO2, these are not sustainable measures. UN governance sounds nice but history has shown such extreme socialism tendencies always rely on and end up in mass murdering the general public (Stalin, Mao, Hitler, Pol Pot etc). Grass rooted democracy may seem irritating to world leaders but it is the only successful way keep us prosperous and in touch with the planet...As such George Carlin's take on politics and environment was right.

In another thread I was asked if I work for Exxon. Here is my response: No. I'm an unemployed climate scientist--kind of a lonely genius. I would, however, gladly take a position with Exxon because, as an environmentalist and a genuine tree hugger, I recognize that the paucity of CO2 in earth's atmosphere does make it more difficult for plants and trees to thrive, and the products of oil companies do rectify the shortage--if only slightly--of this gas that plants and trees breath to survive. I am also an atmospheric physicists who has studied the thermodynamics of the gases of the atmosphere and, as such, I recognize that the net thermal effect of CO2 is atmospheric cooling. And, as a humanitarian, I recognize that the greatest problem for mankind that clearly shows up in the fossil record is the glaciation of most of Europe and Asia and virtually all of North America. Here is something for you to read. In this post I take on a climate skeptic. I accuse him, Dr. Berry, of hypocrisy in comments that he directed at one of the numerous climate alarmist whackjobs that are so prevalent on the internet: The Roof Leaks at the Top: Conversation with Edwin Berry Phd. https://www.thunderbolts.info/forum3/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=446 Also, read down toward the end of the thread to find more links to my content.

Government (UN , NGO's) invest heavily to keep this theme of 'human made' climate change (colder or warmer, both where suggested the past 50 years), as to syphon off stupendous amounts of carbon taxes and inject fear into humanity so they will run into the arms of the 'green' totalitarian world government, as is happening now. And sorry, if you listen to Comrade Klaus S (WEF) his green carbon free reset sounds as communistic as can be: Their goal 2030 : '..You will own NOTHING and you'll be happy about it...' Thats your green agenda goal..ehhh...no thank you.. Call it what you like, but climate 'science' is as political and fact-free as it gets.

These observations doesn't contradict AGW at all and shows that CO2 is an important greenhouse gas. It's also ridiculous that you accuse me of political bias when you label the science as a Marxist conspiracy. If you've really done the independent research that shows that AGW is a falsehood you should publish it and claim your Nobel prize, but I think it's more likely that you just misunderstand the science.

Climatologists can't delineate how quickly the warming would be occurring minus the human species. Scientists are good at making predictions they can test and measure in a low entropy lab or in relatively short time intervals. Creating models and comparing them to real time empirical data. This is the wheelhouse of successful science. Earth climate models over long periods of time are incredibly complex and climatologists don't even know the multitude of absorption variables they aren't aware of as an example. Remember Chernobyl? Scientists predicted it would take generations before wildlife would flourish in that immediate area again. Turns out the Earth was far more resilient to such things than previously estimated. Think of the massive resources dedicated to short term climate models, better known as: meteorology. The funding and manpower of that industry dwarfs that of long term climatology and yet meteorologists still can't accurately predict short term weather patterns. Long term climate models involve more variables, (or should and don't) and yet climatologists claim to understand the science being conducted. We have been warming since the last ice age and the Earth has been through many rapid warming and cooling cycles in its history. The Earth has spent the majority of its timeline at higher temperatures. Climatology is a racket and if you study the history of science you will learn this isn't the first time humans have been wildly over their skiis in similar fashion. Humans are nothing if not egotistical creatures who believe they have the answers to everything. Throw in a complex issue that can be used to extract money and votes and you have the recipe for mass delusion.

We need to combat our pollution for sure (even our CO2 pollution) , if not for the planet (it has been through much more horrors the past billions of years) than for our own living environment as humans. So no plastic waste, no CUTTING forrest for biomass, no burning of any carbon for that matter, pro Thorium MSR fission nuclear (clean and safe). It is just that the narrative that we would be able to meaningfully control the current (mostly natural) rise in temperature, if we wish via dialing down human CO2 output (even if in itself a good thing), is a complete falsehood. Any Marxist, (academia pushed) political revolution based on that premise is false and misleading and will only lead us into poverty and slavery in stead of a bright future.

And if the pattern found in paleo data would continue, we are close to the end of the current warm period, and should actually have a decreasing temperatur on average, on the big scale.

Nope. Here is the google maps project of all papers studying the MWP, most areas were warmer and many found that the areas were dryer or wetter, aka climate change. Earth has been warming for 400 years, prior to that it had been cooling for hundreds of years, prior to that it had been warming for hundreds of years; these aren't "magic" cycles they are explained by cycles of solar variance and ocean oscillations. https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1akI_yGSUlO_qEvrmrIYv9kHknq4&ll=-12.559931042472849%2C117.50507916622843&z=2 The entire back radiation hypothesis is pseudoscience that is fundamentally flawed on so many levels that it is far too much to fully discuss in a TY post. Simply read these to understand why: https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_39.html - https://arxiv.org/pdf/0707.1161.pdf - https://arxiv.org/pdf/1012.0421.pdf - Then compare it to this synapsis of the back radiation hypothesis of climate - http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/staff/trenbert/trenberth.papers/BAMSmarTrenberth.pdf The global warming cult keeps calling quantum physics phenomenon "simple" like he did at 8:20, showing that he doesn't understand it. It's not as simple as "some gases absorb photons and reemit those photons in random directions" and since they emit back towards the surface they "trap heat". The theory of stimulated emission first proposed by Bozeman and Einstein has been proven, today scientists are literally cooling gases with lasers. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHmGNDMV1cY IR emission from the Earth's surface is semi-coherent, the emissions are normal to the emitting surface, and that direction is overwhelmingly out towards space. Deserts cool off so rapidly at night because there is no latent heat, the back radiation hypothesis doesn't seem to show up here. In fact, most desert regions including the Sahara actually lose more radiation to space than they receive from the sun, shown by CERES data onboard the TERRA satellites. It's because radiation from the surface isn't effectively absorbed by "greenhouse gases" and radiated back to the surface, gases mostly lose energy by colliding with lower energy molecules, trillions of collisions per second in just one square meter. On average a photon emitted in dry air reaches space in just 4 milliseconds, it doesn't bounce around the atmosphere like it's "trapped". http://www.biocab.org/Mean_Free_Path_Length_Photons.html Thermal enhancement of solid surfaces underneath an atmosphere is explained by basic physics. Since gases are inherently kinetic/potential energy reservoirs, they act as thermal capacitors. https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Thermal-Enhancement-on-Planetary-Bodies-and-the-of-Holmes/5d3ecd676b4ad08fe1a054b265eea789a9659dc2?p2df	UCy-57V-0NDV73qozYuOPmQA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy-57V-0NDV73qozYuOPmQA	1	Ugx8Fgb_0NBR-ImRxKt4AaABAg	Faustian Revival

""The reconstructions are based on techniques that vary widely in their assumptions and approaches to the reconstruction problem. They span a broad range of complexity using basic proxy composites at the one end and advanced statistical techniques at the other that incorporate physical constraints and forcing information via climate model simulations"" This is a big problem with this whole topic. When taking ACTAUL data the story is different. Old school science of measurement and real tests not computer generated ones. The Pages 2 data is a reset of the original crap in = crap out. At the least we have to take both data sets. Pages 2 does not include any contrary evidence and so it's relabelled "Bias" as "independent research. One pay pay anyone to show something if they are making money from it. My UNPAID research shows the ignorance of conflicting data. We also (sceptics and warmers alike) also have to contend with data changes that should be publicised openly (site by site) to show how the past was cooled and the present warmed. Sadly the self investigation and deleting of emails seems to be a Hillary Clinton sport catching on within some corrupted people. To get back to the science of "Local events" I can cite the papers showing these missing climate cycles and those showing the warm periods where not local. MWP (Medieval warm period could also be the Modern warm period) https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs11434-011-4713-7.pdf (Chinese paper on the temp changes 2485 years and MWP and CWP ) Lüdecke, H.-J., Hempelmann, A., & Weiss, C. (2013). Multi-periodic climate dynamics: spectral analysis of long-term instrumental and proxy temperature records.

Energy & Environment, 18(7), 1049-1058. http://faculty.fgcu.edu/twimberley/EnviroPol/EnviroPhilo/GlobalTempResc.pdf The study also shows the Medieval warm period, The little Ice age and current warm period that started 1690 and continues today. ""In the present study, only three or four of the sites are from Europe, so it cannot be argued that the MWP was strictly a European phenomenon. Other studies also show the MWP (Little Climatic Optimum) in Europe (Lamb, 1965; Martinez-Cortizas et al., 1999; Shindell et al., 2001), Greenland (Dahl-Jensen et al., 1998), Africa (deMenocal et al., 2000; Holmgren et al., 2001), North America (Campbell et al., 1998; Li et al., 2000; Petersen, 1994; Shabalova and Weber, 1999), South America (Iriondo et al., 1993; Villabala, 1994), and Asia (Hong et al., 2000; Liu et al., 1998)." Some 44 locations also say "It's not a local event" The Lüdeke paper also shows the missing climate cycles. the 61 yr Yoshimura and De-Vries ~2010-240 When peaks stack = Warming. Troughs = Cold. The IPCC AR5 report took TSi from 1850 NOT 1680 when the warming started. A nice trick but it get's TSI (solar output) to 20times less than it should be. Co2 Ice core proxy is also unreliable, the temp data is in agreement with climate cycles. CO2 was ~380PM 500AD, 325PPM <1939 it was 425PPM 13000 years ago...No "Forcing" then either. Conclusion. There have been a series of fatally flawed arguments used to prop up AGW theory. Sure there is an effect, its small as shown in this paper: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324599511_Thermal_Enhancement_on_Planetary_Bodies_and_the_Relevance_of_the_Molar_Mass_Version_of_the_Ideal_Gas_Law_to_the_Null_Hypothesis_of_Climate_Change There is also the points of this so called "Established" science being correct! yet it's highlighted there are differences back then in conclusions. I DO listen to certified Genius's rather than propaganda, the point is HEAT at the IR spectrum the earth cools is NOT at a "Blocking" lambda Co2 operates in. ALL matter once heated gives off its energy. No exception. Imagine a river flowing. Co2 is you with a sturdy spear and you stick it in the river bed. Making it longer reaches a point it's sticking out above the water. Adding more spear is just making it longer of adding more to the river bed directly behind the 1st one. The water will flow past 20 or 50 of these in a line. The are NOT a dam since each must follow the same line as the 1st. THAT is how CO2 and methane is working. Doubling as shown in the Holms paper is just water displacement (very slightly) so doubling bring a hypothetical +.01C heating which would take a long time AND assume NO uptake from the natural world (observed by Nasa as greening)	UC_Wc0Fg54cK4LbeHQ0-4fXw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_Wc0Fg54cK4LbeHQ0-4fXw	1	Ugx8Fgb_0NBR-ImRxKt4AaABAg	Faustian Revival

As I showed critical thinking knows that the models are missing so much data to be of actual use to start with PLUS always overestimating = made up forecasts. To quote a worrisome part of your post here: ""It's even more hilarious that people who believe they are capable of critical thinking actually just look for youtube videos that confirms their belief, and just forget about all the well studied research on basic topics such as radiative forcing, climate feedbacks, Milankovitch cycles, Natural Variability, General Circulation Models etc"" 2 points. 1. On You tube you are saying that YouTube is no source of information and you write about that in the place you claim is no source of information. That's funny if you are joking. 2. "Radiative forcing" is a contrived concept misusing the Stefan Boltzmann constant (meant for solids) on a Gas. That is why "Layers" of atmosphere where contrived to overcome this fail. Climate scientists also ""lost"" saturation and decided to ignore the scientists that invented the device that can measure the spectrographic properties of an element. 3. You mention Milankovitch cycles, Natural Variability, General Circulation Models etc" What is the etc part? could your "Etc" part be indeed these missing cycles.

Glaciers are moving, breathing almost living things because ice acts as a fluid. There's nothing weird about new things ending up at the bottom of a glacier even if the glacier had been there for a million years. it's all about the internal movement of the glacier. That's why you have to be really picky about where you take ice cores from if you want to go back far in time. The more static that particular little piece of ice has been over periods of millions of years, the better. And even then you have to contend with sinkholes, fissures, meltwater rivers, etc. If you want to go around being "critical" at least learn a little about the items you want to be critical about. Also your attempt at undermining scientific findings by calling them all "marxists" is juvenile. Also saying that humans are not the dominant factor when it comes to economics is... Kind of hilarious. Have you noticed any other species taking part in our economy recently? Exactly who except for humans have an influence on an economic system made up by humans?

They'd better use these trillions to adapt the landscap where needed to mitigate risks. To be sure I also am against polluting the world, against burning trees ('green' biomass) and even against disturbing the CO2 balans which human industrialization definitely does. But to construct on the basis of false science the narrative that humans would be the cause (or even significantly contributed to) the current warming period and thus could reverse it once we reverse policies (i.e. once we lower our CO2 emissions) is simply not true and is a misuse of science for political purpose. On the basis of this we even have our freedoms taken away from us in the EU where an EU marxist ' green initiative' is imposed on us because of those incorrect narratives. So it is less innocent than you think to continuously provide a platform to CO2 stories. Tehn again it, is her platform so thats her right.

My point is exactly the opposite. I ridicule the very idea CO2 is a substantial factor at all in this discussion. CO2 is only 0,04% of our atmosphere and a mere 3% of all greenhouse gasses. The only reason the environmental community is hyping CO2 is because there is a clear undeniable relation between its rise and human industrialization. But this does not mean the is a causal relation between the CO2 and the current warmer period. As such it HAPPENS to currently coincide with a warming period and thats why they try to link both, since injecting fear and guilt into humanity is a great political instrument. But any objective scientist would look beyond this simplistic idea, and quickly see that this cannot be the case if one analyses the much warmer earth periods (with far LOWER CO2) over the past thousands of years. Climate like all natural things always has been and always was a cyclical phenomenon, never a linear phenomenon. The entire 'human induced' climate change is unfortunately just a way to scare people and get more taxes (and thus pay for the idiotic academic reports) and accept world governance as a solution. It is really too childish to even discuss as a matter and certainly not worthy of any serious academic to spent a second on...If even top scientists start to actually believe their own manure they produced than god help us all. Then we have seen the apex of human civilization for sure and its down hill form here...buckle up....

Win your entire argument against climate science relies on the "fact" that there is one possible cause of rise in earth temperature (so low CO2 level with high temperature led you believe CO2 cannot be the cause). But that is not a fact, it's a religious belief. A pretty dumb belief, ignoring all basic chemistry and facts about solar cycle or geoscience. See, I have refuted your entire chain of posts (which have no source). You haven't grasped what "fact" means. It's always the most hopeless and most dangerously stupid people who believe they "only look at facts", when all they have is an unquestioned religious dogma they are not aware of. Here are some facts: 1. You have not addressed the basic logical error I pointed out from my first post. 2. You have not provided any source for your claims. You have no data or analysis of data but firmly believe you have "facts". 3. The theory you support has not produced any correct prediction, but I can let this slide, because it's your religion. Look at how science is done, their models and evaluations are completely transparent https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/WG1AR5_Chapter09_FINAL.pdf 4. You attempted to refute scientific papers with just words and talk of politics. See, have you actually looked at the facts even within this small discussion? I'm not talking about grand issue like the climate :) Scientific self-cleansing process is being carried out when people like you who never passed statistics class in high school have no say in how statistics is being done. Hey that's another fact!

See "No evidence for globally coherent warm and cold periods over the pre-industrial Common Era" [2019] https://boris.unibe.ch/132301/7/333323_4_merged_1557735881.pdf One extract from that paper : "In contrast, we find that the warmest period of the last two millennia occurred simultaneously in the 20th century for over 98% of the globe. This provides strong evidence that anthropogenic global warming is not only unparalleled in terms of absolute temperatures , but also unprecedented in spatial consistency within the context of the last 2,000 years."

You follow a political agenda (scaring people, after which socialists governments rake in stupendous taxes, which in part go back to your 'scientific' institutions to fund these fake studies) and that's fine. Don't get me wrong, I am against man induced pollution, deforrestation and what more , but with respect to CO2 (government's big tax-moneymaker), yes I am all for cutting down these emissions also, but there is demonstratively NO linear relation between CO2 rise and global warming of the earth over a longer period, unless you want to erase all archeologic findings that prove this. Sorry, the early middle ages and Roman period, were far warmer periods coinciding with FAR LOWER CO2 levels. You can't argue with facts. So please make up any mathematical model you want (skewed towards the outcome your government wants, like Imperial College did with Covid 19 producing a 30X too high fatality prognosis) but it is plain and simple fraud, doing more harm than good to humanity... It is a silly subject and I am sad to see how many people get lured into the wrong direction, paying taxes into the completely wrong directions and even producing environmental disasters (forest bio mass burning).

Nobody "proves" any thing with ANY empirical science, "fundamental" physics or other "deeper insight" you got from your religion doesn't provide proofs either. Appealing to Einstein's authority doesn't work because Einstein would say the same thing "As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality". Proofs only exist in mathematics. I don't know what they wrote in pop sci magazines to convince dumb people about global warming but I can see that it led to many fundamental misunderstandings. Do you actually have a proof that the sun will rise tomorrow? if you think you do, then I am completely right, you just don't know what a proof means. Google the problem of induction. Learn the difference between inductive vs deductive inference. What we have is simply rational decision making in the case of global warming. The climate scientists recommend rational action by comparing probabilities of different scenarios (climate models with different parameters). More importantly please refrain from using words such as "causation" and "correlation" when you don't know what they mean. You need to read https://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r350.pdf before parroting the slogan "correlation does not imply causation" in this case. That slogan does not say what you think it says when it comes to statistics, people do in fact infer cause from statistical data all the time, that's how diseases are diagnosed and cured. Only the scientific illiterates don't understand how much of their daily life is affected by causal inference in statistics, they think progress in science is like magic with deeeep "human insight" and similar big words they parrot from some famous scientist lol From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_inference "The main difference between causal inference and inference of association is that the former analyzes the response of the effect variable when the cause is changed" guess what? the climate scientists did the standard causal inference: They did remove the anthropic CO2 forcing in their model, that is "changing the assumed cause": All the models are unable to predict recent warming without taking human CO2 emission into account. In fact the climate science deniers did try to build statistical models to explain climate's behavior over the past century without CO2 warming, but their predictions were wrong so many times in the last several decades they have quit making statistical models altogether and only focus on trashing other side's climate models and try to get dumb laymen on their side with pure sophistries. Of course I don't expect the scientific illiterates to know what this behavior means :)) you guys are only skeptical about one side of the issue, the other side is your religion.

Statistics is fine but you can't 'proof' with statistics that the underlying physical concept you are promoting with it is 'fundamental' or just correlated to a deeper insight. You are mixing up correlation with causation. With QP we simply did not even bother to look for any underlying physical concept anymore...In that sense statistics as the 'scientific proof as e.g. promoted by shady magazines like Nature, are not meant to promote human insight, but keep us literally in the dark, imposing limits to our progress. I think Einstein said it best: '..Concepts which have proved useful for ordering things easily assume so great an authority over us, that we forget their terrestrial origin and accept them as unalterable facts. They then become labeled as 'conceptual necessities,' etc. The road of scientific progress is frequently blocked for long periods by such errors...'

Win I'm not sure which is funnier, your basic misunderstanding that statistical science deals with "proofs", or that you wrote wall of text to share you misunderstanding with others and rant about Marxism "it was at LEAST 5 degrees warmer 2000 years ago on a global scale. since CO2 levels were much lower back than we simply cannot hard-link rising CO2 levels to the rise in Earth's temperature" Without looking at climate data anyone who has grasped propositional logic (high school students) could see you are incapable of logical reasoning (which makes your criticism even funnier): your premise does not entail your conclusion at all. The warm climate in the past is caused by X does not entail "we cannot link" current warm climate to another cause Y. Not to mention we already know that X is absent (In this case X could be orbital changes, solar cycle, etc. and Y could be the raise in CO2 level, none of these details matters because the form of your reasoning is already illogical) That linking between rise in temperature and rising CO2 levels is called causal inference through statistical modeling, it is not a "proof", just like you can never have a "proof" that the sun will rise tomorrow. Apparently you don't know what a proof means. Please at least educate yourself on the difference between inductive and deductive reasoning before giving opinions on science. "Fact is that the current warming is by and large a cyclical event" No it's not a fact lol it seems you don't know what a fact means either... Natural climate cycles *THEORIES* are inferred from paleo data, people who look at those data and hypothesize about natural cycles also build models and they conclude that there is a huge difference between current climate and natural cycle https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16494.epdf  The religious belief that recent rising temperature can be explained by some magical "cyclical event" is unsupported by any model. It's even more hilarious that people who believe they are capable of critical thinking actually just look for youtube videos that confirms their belief, and just forget about all the well studied research on basic topics such as radiative forcing, climate feedbacks, Milankovitch cycles, Natural Variability, General Circulation Models etc. People who follow the climate denial religion are in no position to criticize Marxists or flat earthers.

Fact is that we we have glaciers melting currently. That is true. But fact is also that under these melting ice sheets we are finding 2000 year old well preserved and rooted tree trunks, dating back to the Roman era. Not just in the Alps, but also in Siberia and Iceland. This unambiguously proofs it was at LEAST 5 degrees warmer 2000 years ago on a global scale. Now, since CO2 levels were much lower back than (which I am happy to accept) we simply cannot hard-link rising CO2 levels (for which indeed humans have a strong influence, and yes it is a greenhouse gass) to the short term rise in Earth's temperature. So by posting video's like this Sabine is supporting the notion that human induced rise of CO2 levels would be crucial to predict future rise of temperature and thus that having reliable CO2 predictions is important . Fact is that the current warming (which is mostly regional by the way) is by and large a cyclical event, possibly even linked to solar output cycles. Much as Marxists want to believe, we humans are not always the dominant factor (whether in the economy or in Nature), nor can thus steering our habits have a major impact on the grander cycles. Yes we must stop polluting our planet and stop cutting trees in the Amazone, but we should also not overestimate our impact in Global wether cycles, or even solar Cycles. Bottom line, either Sabine is incapable of logical thought or she is deliberately letting herself be used as an alarmist in the marxist push for centralized government. To some extend it is sad to see one of the very few critical thinkers in the scientific world not being able to distinguish facts from fiction. Humanity is letting itself get hyped and perhaps we don't deserve a brighter future because of our proven incapability of opinion-free judgement...So whatever...:-)	UCtKiDIf9OK27p_5oTFlp7WA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtKiDIf9OK27p_5oTFlp7WA	1	Ugx8Fgb_0NBR-ImRxKt4AaABAg	Faustian Revival

That said it also seems clear that the current climate models are overshooting by a factor of nearly two.

Ugw6wz9DiQyCT-yK3694AaABAg	0	0	2019-12-03 02:16:19	grindupBaker	<b>*</b> PART 1 OF 3 <b>*</b> <br />This is how the so-called &quot;greenhouse effect&quot; in Earth&#39;s troposphere causes warming. The so-called &quot;greenhouse effect&quot; effect is nothing at all like the effect that warms a greenhouse. A vast &quot;shimmer&quot; of transverse electromagnetic radiation (TER) in the long-wave band (LWR) is caused by molecules of water vapour (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (NO2) and some other gases in the troposphere due to their collisions (averaging 2,700,000,000 collisions / second) with other molecules, which are almost always going to be nitrogen (N2) or oxygen (O2) because they are almost all of the gas quantity in the troposphere. The H2O, CO2, CH4, NO2 and some other gases are being called &quot;greenhouse gases (GHGs)&quot; because the overall effect (not just this part) ends up causing warming of Earth&#39;s troposphere. All except H2O are called &quot;well-mixed greenhouse gases&quot; because their boiling and freezing points are so low that they don&#39;t condense or freeze in the troposphere, not even near the top, so they get spread out well mixed around Earth and well mixed vertically in the troposphere. The well-mixed GHGs now punch above their weight compared with water vapour (H2O) because the upper half of the troposphere is so cold that almost all H2O forms on dust/salt particles in liquid or solid form there rather than being a GHG but the others remain as GHGs. The lowest quarter or so of the troposphere where it&#39;s warmer and water vapour (H2O) is king is already highly &quot;saturated&quot; without much additional &quot;enhanced greenhouse effect&quot; possible (still, H2O has such a broad absorption band that it still manages to match CO2 pretty much exactly 1:1 net as a 100% +ve feedback). <br />------------------ <br />The GHG molecules don&#39;t emit a photon (LWR unit) of LWR when they collide and they don&#39;t later get to emit a photon of LWR after every collision, only after a few of them (note 1). What happens is that a collision might cause a GHG molecule to vibrate in a certain way (so with a certain energy) of which the GHG molecule has the capability of any one of a selection (called its &quot;vibrational modes&quot;). GHG molecules with more vibrational modes are more powerful GHGs because they have a broader absorption/emission band. The GHG molecule now has &quot;molecular vibrational energy (MVE)&quot; if the collision did cause it to vibrate. Energy cannot be created without destroying matter and matter doesn&#39;t get destroyed by this. What happens is that one or both of the two molecules slows down such that the total &quot;molecular translational energy (MTE)&quot;, aka &quot;molecular kinetic energy&quot;, aka &quot;heat&quot;, is reduced by precisely the same amount as the MVE that the GHG molecule acquired, so (m1*v1**2 + m2*v2**2)/2 after collision is less than (m1*v1**2 + m2*v2**2)/2 before collision because either v1 or v2 or both was reduced, thus obeying the Law Of Conservation Of Energy. Effectively, the temperature of the 2 colliding molecules was reduced by an energy amount equaling the MVE that the GHG molecule acquired, what happened was energy transmutation from one form to another. When this vibrating GHG molecule hits another molecule it loses its vibration (note 1) and one or both of the two molecules speeds up such that the total MTE, aka &quot;heat&quot;, is increased by precisely the same amount as the MVE that the GHG molecule lost. So it just moved speed/heat from one N2 or O2 (almost always) molecule to another. However, ==here we go==, very occasionally/rarely and not very often at all compared with the 2,700,000,000 collisions / second that happen to this GHG molecule (note 2) the GHG molecule with MVE will spontaneously emit a photon of LWR and lose its MVE. Now it has converted one-photon&#39;s-worth of &quot;heat&quot; in the troposphere to one photon of LWR. It has cooled the troposphere by one-photon&#39;s-worth of &quot;heat&quot; (one molecule is now in a global Mini Ice Age ?). <br />------------------ <br />LWR is also radiated from the surfaces of liquids &amp; solids such as the surface of the ocean, the surfaces of water droplets in spray above the ocean, the surfaces of water droplets in clouds, the surfaces of any water droplets at all, the land surface, the surfaces of trees &amp; grass, the skins of animals, the surfaces of dust, salt, volcanic ash, any ash and any surface whatsoever on the ocean or land or in the troposphere. Except for 10% of this LWR whose photons happen to have wave-lengths in a band called &quot;the atmospheric window&quot; this LWR goes into the vast &quot;shimmer&quot; of LWR in the troposphere with a distribution of energy quantity at each wave-length in the LWR band that you&#39;ve all seen hundreds of plots of all over the place. <br />------------------ <br />GHG molecules also absorb LWR provided that the photon&#39;s energy (which is its wave-length) perfectly matches one of that GHG molecule&#39;s MVE mode energies and the photon goes through (or tries to go through) the area of the GHG molecule that absorbs that wave-length (obvious example, CO2 isn&#39;t at all fussy what part of its molecule a photon of wave-length 15.00 microns goes through, it&#39;ll swallow it and vibrate). Obviously, a GHG molecule neither knows nor cares whether a photon of a certain wave-length trying to go through it was emitted by the surface of the ocean, the surfaces of water droplets in spray above the ocean, the surfaces of water droplets in clouds, the surfaces of any water droplets at all, the land surface, the surfaces of trees &amp; grass, the skins of animals, the surfaces of dust, salt, volcanic ash, any ash and any surface whatsoever on the ocean or land or in the troposphere, or emitted by another GHG molecule (H2O, CO2, CH4, NO2 and any other GHG molecule) because all photons of the same wave-length are the same. A GHG molecule with MVE that it got by absorbing LWR can, of course, ==here we go again==, very occasionally/rarely and not very often at all compared with the 2,700,000,000 collisions / second that happen to this GHG molecule (note 2) spontaneously emit a photon of LWR and lose its MVE. In this case the GHG molecule transmuted LWR back to LWR, it transmuted a photon to an identical photon, so it did nothing at all other than change the direction in which the photon is going. This is the cartoon that scientists show the public because it&#39;s a simple analog that Earth tried to cool itself to space and failed, but since there are 2,700,000,000 collisions / second there&#39;s just about a bat&#39;s chance in hell that the GHG molecule will spontaneously emit a photon of LWR and lose its MVE before it collides and loses its MVE (note 1). The coal/oil shills use the highly-incorrect nature of this ludicrously-over-simplified cartoon to &quot;disprove&quot; the physics theory but it isn&#39;t the physics theory that&#39;s incorrect, it&#39;s the cartoon that&#39;s incorrect. It doesn&#39;t describe the physics theory hardly at all as I&#39;ve explained in detail above. This is why I dislike this cartoon. When a vibrating GHG molecule hits another molecule it loses its vibration (note 1) and one or both of the two molecules speeds up. This means that &quot;heat&quot; increased, what happened was energy transmutation from one form to another, energy transmutation from LWR to &quot;heat&quot; with MVE as the intermediary step.

UgyUZGd6ln9zUFCaLA14AaABAg	2	0	2019-12-03 02:15:44	grindupBaker	<b>*</b> PART 2 OF 3 <b>*</b> <br />Now the so-called &quot;enhanced greenhouse effect&quot; explanation that I think is clearest, obvious and difficult to challenge by mis-direction disinformation and subterfuge per the memes concocted by the coal/oil shills. 17% of the LWR that Earth sends to space is emitted by the ocean or land surface because the photons are in a wave-length band called &quot;the atmospheric window&quot; that doesn&#39;t get absorbed by the GHGs. It&#39;s my understanding that this will narrow slightly with increased GHGs, but this isn&#39;t the prime &quot;enhanced greenhouse effect&quot; and I&#39;m not addressing any additional warming it might cause. 83% of the LWR that Earth sends to space is emitted by the GHG molecules in the troposphere, tropopause and stratosphere (note 2). This 83% of the LWR is the part that gets reduced by increased tropospheric GHGs and causes an energy imbalance with insufficient energy going out, which causes global warming, ocean heating and ice fusion, which causes climate change, which causes a variety of nuisances that I haven&#39;t studied. <br />------------------ <br />The troposphere has an upper and a lower surface. The upper surface is the top of the troposphere (the tropopause) and the lower surface is the surface of the ocean or land. LWR produced in the troposphere that reaches the lower surface will warm that surface so it stays in Earth&#39;s ecosphere but LWR produced in the troposphere that reaches the upper surface has a good chance to make it through the increasingly-thin tropopause, stratosphere and the ultra-thin extended atmosphere to space and be energy lost to Earth&#39;s ecosphere, thus cooling it. LWR reaching the upper/lower surfaces was produced by GHG molecules, the surfaces of water droplets and the surfaces of solid particles (sea salt, ash, dust) throughout the troposphere sending photons upwards/downwards as described in detail earlier. <br />- There is an average altitude in the troposphere of the LWR quantity that reaches space. If you could float at this altitude and watch/count photons with special eye balls and brain you&#39;d see 50% of those photons that reach space are heading up from below you. If you counted it at 48% then you&#39;d need to float upward to get more of the LWR photon production below you. If you counted it at 52% then you&#39;d need to float downward to get more of the LWR photon production above you. This is obvious. When you float to the place where 50.0000000% of those photons that reach space are heading up from below you then you are at the average altitude in the troposphere of the LWR quantity that reaches space. <br />- There is an average altitude in the troposphere of the LWR quantity that reaches the surface of the ocean or land. You could float and find that the same way as the preceding. <br />These 2 altitudes in the troposphere are approximately for illustration only and as a global average (I&#39;m not quantifying the so-called &quot;enhanced greenhouse effect&quot; in this comment, only describing its operation accurately): <br />---- average --- ---- average global ---- <br />---- altitude --- ---- temperature ---- <br />6,600 metres -29.75 degrees 50% of the &quot;shimmer cloud&quot; of LWR photons that will make it to the tropopause are emitted by GHG molecules and the surfaces of cloud droplets and atmospheric particles below this altitude. <br />1,650 metres 3.7 degrees 50% of the &quot;shimmer cloud&quot; of LWR photons that will make it to the surface of the ocean or land are emitted by GHG molecules and the surfaces of cloud droplets and atmospheric particles below this altitude. <br />These values are approximate. They are to demonstrate how the so-called &quot;enhanced greenhouse effect&quot; works, not to provide quantities. They are approximately correct though. They are based on a global average ~12,000 metres height of the troposphere but it varies geographically from 9,000 to 16,000 metres. <br />--------------- <br />If tropospheric GHGs are increased then 2 changes occur per my explanations above since the start of my comment: <br />1) More LWR than before is produced by the GHGs, and <br />2) More LWR than before is absorbed by the GHGs because the LWR photons have to make it through more GHG molecules that might absorb them before they can reach their goal of going up past the top of the troposphere or going down past the bottom of the troposphere and being absorbed into the ocean or land. <br />Note that I have not included &quot;(3) The LWR photons emitted by the surface of the ocean and land have to make it through more GHG molecules that might absorb them before they can reach space&quot; because I&#39;m dealing with the 83% of the LWR getting space that&#39;s created by GHG molecules in the troposphere obtaining, then losing, MVE with spontaneous photon emission caused. I&#39;m not dealing with the 17% of the LWR in a wave-length band called &quot;the atmospheric window&quot; that gets directly to space after being emitted by the surface of the ocean and land. If that 17% is reduced by increased tropospheric GHGs (I&#39;m not sure) then that&#39;s an additional, unrelated, means of the so-called &quot;enhanced greenhouse effect&quot; (there&#39;s no particular reason why there has to be only one mechanism). <br />--------------- <br />The result of combined effects/changes (1), (2) above is that the average altitude in the troposphere of the LWR quantity that reaches the top of the troposphere gets higher, so perhaps it raises from the 6,600 metres to 6,700 metres (as an example). Also, the LWR quantity is reduced slightly (the so-called &quot;enhanced greenhouse effect&quot;) for reason of the tropospheric temperature lapse rate explained below. <br />--------------- <br />Likewise, identically, the average altitude in the troposphere of the LWR quantity that reaches the surface of the ocean or land gets lower, so perhaps it lowers from the 1,650 metres to 1,550 metres (obviously, it depends on the change quantity. I just showed a random example) because it has to get past more GHG molecules that might absorb the photon. <br />--------------- <br />In either case GHG photons were trying to reach their goal of the top or bottom of the troposphere but now there are more GHGs in the way so it needs, == on average ==, to be a bit closer to make it. So that&#39;s why the &quot;cloud&quot; of LWR that will reach the top is a higher cloud than before and the &quot;cloud&quot; of LWR that will reach the bottom (ocean or land) is a lower cloud than before <br />--------------- <br />The tropospheric temperature lapse rate is required to cause the so-called &quot;enhanced greenhouse effect&quot;. <br />The average altitude for LWR to space got higher (6,600 metres ---&gt; 6,700 metres in my example) which means LWR to space is from colder (slower) molecules on average because tropospheric temperature decreases with altitude and LWR to space is from higher-up-than-before molecules on average, so there are fewer GHG molecular collisions / second which leads to less MVE which leads to less LWR production. The quantity of LWR energy (power flux) provided by a mass of gas is proportional to its temperature(Kelvin)**4 (to the fourth power) so, as explained in detail above, the increasing of tropospheric GHGs ==must== cause less LWR than before to be passing upwards through the top of the troposphere. <br />That&#39;s the upper end of how the so-called &quot;enhanced greenhouse effect&quot; works.

That is that the net radiation received will equal net radiation radiated. This doesn't change. You can propose a system whereby a greater percentage of radiation is absorbed - and this will change the equilibrium temperature to some extent. The problem is that the models ultimately break equilibrium. Which is why scientists were looking for "the missing warming" - which never was and never will be.

The quantity of LWR energy (power flux) provided by a mass of gas is proportional to its temperature(Kelvin)**4 (to the fourth power) so, as explained in detail above, the increasing of tropospheric GHGs ==must== cause more LWR than before to be passing downwards to the surface of the ocean and land. This latter is called &quot;downwelling LWR radiation at the surface&quot; and I&#39;ve explained why it must increase and this must, of course, warm the land and ocean surface. <br />That&#39;s the lower end of how the so-called &quot;enhanced greenhouse effect&quot; works. <br />--------- . <br />Note 1: I haven&#39;t yet found the collision MVE production &amp; destruction spectra so I don&#39;t know what %age make MVE and what %age destroy MVE. I looked a few hours 4 years ago but couldn&#39;t find it (not for free anyway). It makes no difference to the description of the mechanism above but it would be needed to confirm the quantity of effect for doubling CO2. <br />Note 2: I&#39;ve read on the internet that spontaneous emission of a photon of LWR by a GHG molecule with MVE will typically occur after ~1.0 seconds with MVE but I&#39;m not accepting that without some serious fact checking which I haven&#39;t done yet. One photon / second just seems way too minuscule to me. I also need that information to calculate whether mis-calibration method of the STAR MSU/AMSU instrument makes the RSS &amp; UAH TLT temperature O2 proxy analyses analyse a significantly lower total of energy than thermometers measure, or whether the difference is negligible. It makes no difference to the description of the mechanism above. <br />Note 3: 80% of Earth&#39;s atmosphere is in the troposphere (the top of which is 16 km in the tropics and 9 km in the polar regions, averaging ~12,000 metres). The &quot;greenhouse effect&quot; warming can only happen in Earth&#39;s troposphere, there&#39;s no effect in Earth&#39;s tropopause and the effect is &quot;backwards&quot; in Earth&#39;s stratosphere with =increased= stratospheric GHG gases causing =cooling= of the stratosphere because the stratospheric temperature lapse rate has temperature increasing with altitude (that&#39;s how it&#39;s known with total certainty that it&#39;s increased &quot;greenhouse gases (GHGs)&quot; doing the global warming for the last several decades). Since there&#39;s no temperature lapse rate in the tropopause then any change in the quantity/type of GHGs in the tropopause cannot have any warming or cooling effect on the tropopause or the entire atmosphere, ocean or land. No effect at all. If you follow my description of the effect above for the troposphere but apply it to the tropopause then you&#39;ll clearly see that any change in the quantity/type of GHGs in the tropopause cannot have any warming or cooling effect That&#39;s the reality. The increasing GHGs in the stratosphere are a slight -ve feedback to global warming because downwelling LWR radiation from the stratosphere increases with increased GHGs, but it&#39;s a very slight -ve feedback because only 6.3% of the well-mixed GHGs (and all molecules) are above the tropopause and they are initially colder than the average of the troposphere so they make even less LWR than the 6.3% factor. By the time the stratosphere warms more than the average of the troposphere there&#39;s only 0.4% of Earth&#39;s atmosphere&#39;s molecules above, negligible. <br />Note 4: FTIR power flux vs wave-length spectra recorded by the instrument on a satellite show which wave-lengths of LWR heading to space past the satellite came from the surface of the ocean and land and which wave-lengths came, on average, from the GHG molecules and surfaces of solid particles and water droplets in the atmosphere. From this atmospheric physicists have calculated the 83% of the LWR that Earth sends to space that is emitted by the atmosphere rather than by the surface of the ocean and land. Also, the MODTRAN tool on the internet can be used to play with a theoretical calculation of the FTIR power flux vs wave-length spectra by adjusting GHGs.

Suppose you have a warmer winter during which the cold nighttime temperatures go up by 10C at higher latitudes but still remain well below freezing. If all other temperatures remain the same, we will have an increase. But there is nothing to suggest that the increase is harmful because it has no meaning. The observations suggest that a doubling will produce a 1.2C increase in average temperatures. That would be beneficial for humanity and the biosphere. So why does it matter?

All say &quot;The water level will be rising&quot;, but cities around the world still expand at sea level for just for that (for some reason) are the most exclusive land, for me climate change is not as scare as the collective stupidity that spend more time on saving old places like Venice rather than thinking of where the cities of the future will be located.<br />And the best thing we can do is to live as climate change is right whatever we think, it is better for the environment, better for the air quality, it help economy by stimulate to invention and development and it pushes technology forward.

So high average temperatures and higher had the world at the time of the dinosaurs. The honest and neutral politicians independent climate scientists confirm: The opposite of global warming will occur. The changing activities of the sun determined the climate on planet Earth and not man. The earth now has a warm phase and in 80 years will again come steadily into a cold phase, as in the years around 1890. On a previous warm period around the years 1780 followed again and again a cold period in the cycle of 100 to 120 years. The activity of the sun pumps, also depending on the number of sunspots. Other stars in space also have strong swings in their activities. This evolution of the activity of the Sun is to be seen from the climate data in the past 1000 years and also to see that the climate on the planet earth had always cyclically changed between warm and cold periods. There were also ice ages! Accordingly, in the next world climatic period until the year 2100, the mean temperature will logically drop again steadily by one degree Celsius. In 100 years we have worldwide temperatures again as in the years around 1880, the last glacial period. So get dressed!

The warming is measured by 3,800 self-profiling floats called "Argo floats" and is +0.11 degrees / decade for the shallowest 750 metres. The stratosphere is cooling. The 1st gives the quantity and the 2nd gives the cause. Only an increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHGs) can simultaneously warm the oceans, warm the troposphere and cool the stratosphere. An increase in solar radiation cannot simultaneously warm the oceans, warm the troposphere and cool the stratosphere. A decrease in global average cloud cover cannot simultaneously warm the oceans, warm the troposphere and cool the stratosphere. A decrease in air pollution aerosols cannot simultaneously warm the oceans, warm the troposphere and cool the stratosphere. No increased form of energy entering Earth's atmosphere from space can simultaneously warm the oceans, warm the troposphere and cool the stratosphere. No decreased form of energy entering Earth's atmosphere from space can simultaneously warm the oceans, warm the troposphere and cool the stratosphere. No increased form of geothermal heat can simultaneously warm the oceans, warm the troposphere and cool the stratosphere. An increase in heat leaving the oceans cannot simultaneously warm the oceans, warm the troposphere and cool the stratosphere. Only increased atmospheric GHGs can simultaneously warm the oceans, warm the troposphere and cool the stratosphere, and that is what's been happening the last 50 years. It's the smoking gun for increased atmospheric GHGs being the cause.	UCGcEOvg7z8aL9LvTH4QFnWA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGcEOvg7z8aL9LvTH4QFnWA	1	UgwaS8VbosEVqc_nxq14AaABAg	Nickel Chrome

The less the suns energy soaks into the ground during the day the cooler it will be and the less energy that can be trapped by co2 when it radiates back up. Many of the temperature readings are taken in areas that have had trees replaced by concrete thus giving false data.<br />Strategic planting of trees and using shade sails to keep the ground from heat soaking will have more effect that reducing greenhouse emissions in the short term and result in the models becoming more correct.

Trees do not instantly grow and convert their entire mass from co2 instantly But you can convert almost the entire mass of a tree into co2 almost instantly. Planting trees for capturing co2 is a waste of time as there is not enough land to make the slightest dent in co2 levels . CO2 has stuff all impact on global mean temperatures fortunately otherwise we'd be living in a furnace.

You are incorrect with your 1st comment and you are correct with your 2nd comment that contradicted your 1st comment. So "but not by reducing co2 , but by simply shading the ground" --- Wrong. "Plants grow by absorbing the suns energy , if that energy is absorbed and converted it can't radiate back up from the ground" -- Correct but it directly contradicts your line above. When plants grow by absorbing the suns energy they reduce CO2, that's exactly what they do. And, as you correctly stated, the Sun's energy that's required to convert CO2 to C and O2 is therefore unavailable for heating so there's some global heating reduction. It could even be worked out easily. If 3,300,000,000 trees were planted each year and they thrived then that would reduce CO2 by 10 GtC / year as the trees reduced CO2 and grew. They would then be using the same energy quantity as all of humans' current fossil fuel energy with a slight difference for efficiency of photosynthesis vs coal/oil/gas burning for electricity, heating and motivation. Strange thing is I'm sure you meant "but not by reducing co2" as in making CO2 be less but very strangely indeed "reducing CO2" is also the proper technical term for converting CO2 to C and O2 because "reducing" is the opposite chemical process to "oxidizing". That's a weird coincidence that "reducing CO2" slows the increase in Global Mean Surface Temperature (GMST) in 2 entirely-different senses of the same phrase. Anyway, it's always nice chatting with any totally-random coal/oil shill-fuckwit such as yourself. All the best, bye.

I was being facetious , But if you look it up you will find that shade from trees and other foliage does reduce the overall temperature in a climate zone . Think about it, Plants grow by absorbing the suns energy , if that energy is absorbed and converted it can't radiate back up from the ground.

Humans did that. Chinese rice paddies and European settlement. Humans started a global warming attempt 6,000 years ago by increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and more so 4,000 years ago by increasing atmospheric methane (CH4) but that global warming attempt wasn&#39;t sufficient to offset the cyclical ~20,000 year cooling of the Milankovitch cycles that commenced 7,000 years ago. Instead, it only reduced that cooling from the -1.2 degrees that it would have been without the human CO2/CH4 emissions down to the -0.6 degrees that it was as shown at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fkCo_trbT8&amp;t=1m40s">1:40</a>. The human CO2/CH4 emissions for the last 6,000 years have cut the natural cooling in half until ~170 years ago when it overwhelmed the natural cooling completely, and 50 years ago when humans started going hog wild and utterly smashed the natural cooling with near-vertical extreme global warming instead, really going Boss. You can see this explained in clear detail by comparison with half a dozen prior de-glaciations by a ==real scientist== Bill Ruddiman at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqoh1jTBCh4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqoh1jTBCh4</a> Prof William (Bill) Ruddiman &quot;Early Anthropogenic AGW&quot; or &quot;Early Anthropogenic Transformations of Earth&#39;s Climate&quot; by &quot;Understanding Climate Change&quot; at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqoh1jTBCh4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqoh1jTBCh4</a> Bottom line is that Ruddiman hypothesizes that GMST should have dropped 1.2 degrees last 7,000 years until 400 years ago but instead dropped only 0.6 degrees last 7,000 years. Just in case a person interested in the science happens to accidently stumble on this juvenile coal/oil shill-fuckwit video that&#39;s strictly aimed at the army of coal/oil shill-fuckwits, then that not-a-coal/oil-shill-fuckwit who got here by accident can watch that interesting ==real scientist, real science== video instead.

That&#39;s msny times the forcing from CO2. That proves that at most a few might be correct. All the others should be tossed out as Falsified.<br /><br />Yet they are all kept and illogically averaged together. That is NOT scientifically valid. Averaging falsehoods with the truth won&#39;t better reveal the truth.<br /><br />ALL of the models (and the basic theory) predicts considerably more warming in the tropical mid-troposphere. That is not happening...so ALL the models are falsified.<br /><br />Extremes are not increasing. The last IPCC report so stated. The next report is being politicized to report some increases. Flooding isn&#39;t increasing. Cyclone total energy isn&#39;t increasing. Lying will have terrible economic consequences. <br /><br />There is no way to cut emissions enough without nuclear energy...10&#39;s of thousands of plants, but these same liars are blocking it. If we are all going to die, the safest mode of power production (nuclear) must be on the table.	UCPxGYD8XjwP4bM4PE1Q7p0A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPxGYD8XjwP4bM4PE1Q7p0A	0

The climate models with higher-than-ensemble-mean climate sensitivity output reproduce the annual cycle well. Although the division of Sun's SWR radiation into surface absorption portion (161 w/m**2) and cloud/atmosphere absorption portion (78 w/m**2) isn't very accurately known, the absorption total of 239 w/m**2 is far more accurately known (certainly only a tiny fraction of your proposed +/-40 w/m**2) from CERES for SWR inbound & reflected, and from ACRIM/SORTC/TIM for solar flux, so your comparison of the +/-40 w/m**2 with +CO2 forcing is entirely misleading non-information as is entirely typical for a socio-political-only-wealth-interested-science-not-interested coal/oil shill such as yourself.

In 2017 and 2018 Greenland added 1000 Billion tons of ice from snowfall. It lost about the same from calving and melting each year...like it does every year. Arctic ice extent was low in 1925 and 1958 like now. Ice extent expanded tremendously during the 1970 Ice Age scare. It has retreated...but only from that abnormal high ice extent (most since the time of the Little Ice Age). <br /><br />Extreme weather events are not more common. <a href="https://www.climatedepot.com/2018/08/30/prof-roger-pielke-jr-new-book-shreds-the-climate-to-extreme-weather-link/">https://www.climatedepot.com/2018/08/30/prof-roger-pielke-jr-new-book-shreds-the-climate-to-extreme-weather-link/</a><br /><br />Dr. Pielke is a strong advocate for Climate action yet is called a Denier because he won&#39;t falsify data &quot;for the cause&quot;.

It's 270 Gt/year average lost last 18 years but up & down massively from 435 Gt lost in 1 year to 44 Gt gained in 1 year for Greenland. Globally, it's been 575 Gt/year + 44 Gt/year**2 lost for a couple of decades so ~11,500 Gt total lost the last couple of decades. That's 32 mm of global average Sea level change rise (SLR) the last couple of decades, plus 34 mm for heat expansion has been 66 mm of global average Sea level change rise (SLR) the last couple of decades.

Because, in the mind of &#39;layperson voters&#39; such as I, this sea of complexity/uncertainty leaves significant room for doubt as to what degree mankind is directly responsible for climate change at it broadest levels. And with that being the case, to talk of predicting/accounting for specific extreme weather events, sounds utterly fanciful in the context of the current levels of model immaturity. <br /><br /><br />Credit due for some admissions (as opposed to emissions :-) ), because it&#39;s lazy/poor/political media coverage like the Guardian example given here which keeps peddling the narrative: &#39;99.9% of every scientist who has ever existed knows everything about catastrophic climate change and yes you should buy an electric car NOW as that WILL make a difference&quot;.<br /><br /><br />But when you said that you are concerned for the under-developed world, I thought you might acknowledge that it sounds hard to justify a narrative dangerously close to &quot;we have had our industrial revolution, but you can only have yours on our terms, which includes using materials for generating power which you cannot afford......sorry, but our models show that your country might be too hot to live in, in perhaps in as little as 100 years......which models are those you ask.....er.......the ones which we need more funding to get right&quot;.

Did I say I was advocating everything anyone from XR has ever said? No. Don't start straw-manning me. I said lots of scientists support them. When XR say false things, I and plenty of other scientists argue with them like hell. But on balance, would the vast majority of scientists take XR as more mature, more responsible, more scientifically literate and a more considered response to the current climate situation than Jordan Peterson? Yes. Yes, they would. Absolutely no doubt at all. Not all, but most. It's up to you whether you choose to write off the majority of scientists as hysterical loons with no grip on reality (which would be wrong), or whether you think they might understand something significant about complex physical systems such as the climate that you don't (which would be correct).

Have you listened to Peterson's views on the subject, if so, what did you think? "Pseudoscience is extremism" sorry, but that reads as the language of an idealist/activist - scientists constantly look to test, question and disprove, theories are being revised and disproved all the time (to slur alternative viewpoints as 'pseudoscience' or rely upon 'majority opinions' is not what has developed our understanding of the world by the great work of scientists ......and I am saying that to a science teacher?) XR claimed that "billions will die" then the scientific community in this country politely pointed out that there is no data/evidence to support that claim, to which XR basically responded with 'yeah we know that but it's important to grab the headlines'. I think that one either signs up to working from empirical evidence and objective assessment of all available facts, or you are happy to support groups who say such things. But there's the catch, if you accept bending the truth for a cause, for any reason, well, that's where the 'climate deniers' have their field-day and you can't complain when people resort to lazy thinking "so it's all a croc of sh1t then?". i.e XR are damaging the climate argument in the UK (there we go, I am doing it now, making statements as if they are facts). "Good on them"?? No! children are losing sleep and becoming more anxious every day here, they have a nightmarish vision of the world burning soon, a vision which is hysterical in comparison to all but the very worst case scenarios from scientists. I have questions, you have strong beliefs, I think you have 'helped' me as much as you can to be frank, but I will look up your suggestions so thanks for that - as I have said, I am looking for the 'holistic' consideration I spoke of, as opposed to people listing assertions.

They're pseudoscientific. Arguments exist both ways, but the arguments on one side are straightforwardly false. The Earth isn't flat. The climate is warming due to human activity. Presenting these things as if they're debatable is deeply misleading. I'm not advocating for XR, but your assertion that their approach and their presentation of the climate has no support among scientists is untrue. A quick search for scientists supporting extinction rebellion will show you how wrong that is. Scientists supporting the views of Piers Corbyn? Exceptionally few. I can understand why you might think XR are the extremists and PC is some kind of reasonable balance, but the reality - as large parts of the scientific community see it - is entirely the opposite way around. Climate denial - meaning (as per the Oxford English Dictionary) denying the reality of human-caused climate change - is deeply irresponsible pseudoscience, with no more scientific basis than astrology. It's extremism. What XR is proposing is not. I'm not one of them, but thousands of scientists are fully on board and I understand and respect that. I have no interest in conspiracy theories around global taxation. It's dull, it's childish and it's pathetic. Many of these scientists have been watching in horror for decades at what we are doing to the planet we live on, and how little we seem to care. If XR can get more people to care - and they have shown that they can, even people who dislike them intensely - then good on them. If we continue to accelerate climate change, the consequences will be horrific. That is a straightforward statement of physics. There's no politics in it at all. Developing countries will be hit hardest and first if we keep our foot on the accelerator. They don't have to spend hundreds of years choking on coal to catch up with the rest of the world - they can go straight to decentralised, independent clean energy. Look for references to climate in the policies of aid agencies - Oxfam, WHO, Save the Children, Christian Aid, etc. They don't recommend promoting fossil fuels to developing countries, because they're not incompetent. They recommend urgent action is taken on climate change. Because they can see the unthinkable horror that is coming if we don't. Advocating for urgent action on a legitimately urgent situation isn't extremism. It's competence. It's taking responsibility. Pseudoscience is extremism.

I do understand where you are coming from, even though I have questions about certain key areas of the "settled long ago" assertion, but I think they are better dealt with in open and objective debate, with the involvement of experts, rather than trying to deal in YouTube comments. I will follow your advice on increasing my personal understanding and that will hopefully move me on from the 'agnostic' position that I currently have. I remain sceptical on both sides at the moment, and that's largely due to the way in which the varying positions are argued. Not sure in which country you reside but YouTube is the only source of the climate sceptic voice in the UK that I am aware of, with all mainstream media and political debate taking the climate crisis as 'a given'. In fact I would say that the UK public is generally too unawares of the counter arguments and questions around 'climate extremists' (I have XR in mind here, with their politically tinged agenda and proclamations which none of the legitimate climate scientists sign up to). As such, UK mainstream media is totally different to Australia's (Sky) for example. I sense your frustration, so leaving aside my personal doubts/confusions about (1) mankind's Co2 being THE cause for the current climate change as opposed to it being one of a number of highly complex factors, then I am still left with (2) what mankind can realistically do now to reduce carbon to levels that will actually make a difference, and how such steps are considered in a holistic way. So, I am not about to 'lecture' anyone who teaches quantum physics (respect for that btw), but rather, to share my thinking: when I say 'holistic', at a very high/fundamental level, what are the impacts on a human suffering scale of (a) draconian approaches to reducing Co2 which see's much of the poorest in the world plunged even deeper into poverty and only the elite being protected vs (b) rises in sea level and temperature of x-degrees and y-feet. Where is the reasonable compromise, what is the reasonable best expected outcome. That's something other than screaming at the top of voices "cut all Co2 now or we all die in 12 years" , or, "telling us to cut Co2 is due to a globalist plot, we don't need to do anything." If you can point me in the direction of where that kind of sensible debate is taking place I might be a little reassured (I didn't see it in this YouTube clip, or any other, as yet).

There is no scientific debate about the reality or the cause of climate change, or the question of whether or not it is a profoundly serious threat to human health and prosperity worldwide. These questions were settled a long time ago. Are there a handful of scientists clinging onto the idea that it's not s bad? Of course. There are millions of scientists in the world. It's always possible to find a handful with extreme views of any kind. What's unsettling here is how much attention the handful gets in this particular case. Their voices are amplified by those whose politics or whose business interests rely on the unimpeded financial success of the richest corporations on the planet. Most of these voices, eg. Piers Corbyn, are not scientists and have no research expertise in the climate. Every scientific organisation on the planet has made formal statements supporting the basic facts of climate science and the urgency in addressing them. The last one to dispute any of this was the American Association of Petroleum Geologists in 2007. The basic facts were settled long ago. Look in any reputable science publication - Scientific American, New Scientist, Science, Nature - the scientific facts are clear and consistent. Wikipedia is excellent. The NASA website is excellent. The planet is right there, any competent scientist can study it, check the methodology of academic papers, analyse the data. Anyone with an understanding of the basic laws of physics and a bit of statistical competence can check it for themselves, and they do. If you want to know more of the basics, use Wikipedia, the Met Office or the NASA site. For more depth, go to NOAA, try some lectures by active climate scientists, speak with scientists yourself, take a course.... And apply some skepticism to those who promote the narrative that mainstream climate science is bogus. There are always extremists. It takes courage to recognise that the ones whose arguments seem reasonable to you are the extremists. Sometimes I wish more of science were less counterintuitive. I teach quantum physics, so I have to watch students struggle with it, and with their idea of a solid, real world. Climate science can be like that too. The reality is fascinating and genuine, as well as unsettling, but I know that many will never take a single step towards it. I wish more would try.

Unfortunately, he is trying to model 2 highly turbulent, planetary-sized systems that interface with each other over 70 percent of the planet’s surface. He briefly mentioned the Navier-Stokes equation. In order to do what he is trying to do, he would have to solve this equation for turbulence. Unfortunately, this is considered to be one of the great unsolved problems of physics and is one of the 7 millennium problems.<br /><br /><br />There is also the issue of how to measure the temperature of an entire planet, or even a small region of the planet, particularly when there is a tremendous amount of latent heat bound up in the system which is moved around chaotically by a phenomenon that we call ‘weather’.<br /><br /><br />The fact that the GCMs accurately predict temperatures from the 1950s to the 1990s is meaningless, since they would be poor models indeed if they didn’t predict the data that was used to create them! As Nassim Nicholas Taleb pointed out in one of his books, you can curve-fit virtually any dataset, regardless of how random it is. The real question is whether or not the resulting model has any predictive value.<br /><br /><br />Unfortunately, the GCMs have failed to predict the lack of warming over the last 20 years – a fact that Dr. Palmer conveniently failed to mention. Perhaps Dr. Hossenfelder would like to give Richard Lindzen or Nir Shaviv, both of whom have the academic credentials to be taken seriously, equal time to explain why Dr. Palmer is barking up the wrong tree.

I'm a professional physicist, so I do the physics myself, I can assess the quality of the academic research, I can use the laws of physics and do my own calculations. The basic facts are not complicated, and I think it's very reasonable to say that any professional scientist who can't figure it out for themselves is incompetent. It's not an ad hominem. It's also not a slur on non-scientists. If you're not a scientist, there's no reason why you should be able to figure that stuff out. Most people have better things to do with their life than spend years training themselves in science. If a scientist were to claim that the basic facts of climate science are false, that would be rather pathetic. The laws of physics aren't negotiable. They aren't a popularity contest. The vast majority of scientists understand them and use them responsibly. If you're intent on following the ones that do not, come what may, that's your call. All I can do is recommend that you apply skepticism to those who validate your beliefs and try reading around. Speak to a variety of scientists. Take a course in atmospheric physics or planetary science. If you can't bear to be challenged by others, at least challenge yourself.

Sure sounds like argumentum ad hominem to me. When you refer to, "... tens of thousands of scientists who consistently arrive at the conclusion you don't like", it sure sounds like argumentum ad populem to me. Here is a link that was recently posted by Ken Van de Burgt: https://www.rossmckitrick.com/uploads/4/8/0/8/4808045/model_obs_comp_nov_2019.pdf The trend was flat from 2000 to the super el nino in 2016. As the author pointed out, the heat from the el nino is now mostly gone. But you would ignore reality in favor of models that support your pre-conceived beliefs. Sure sounds like confirmation bias to me. Oh by the way, here is a link to the petition project: http://www.petitionproject.org/ It sure sounds like, , "... tens of thousands of scientists arriving at a conclusion you don't like" to me. But you would ignore that inconvenient fact. It sure sounds like the 'argument by selective observation' fallacy to me. As I said in another reply, it's interesting to note how people with no understanding of the subject nevertheless have strong views. They choose to believe 'experts' who espouse theories compatible with their political beliefs and disparage 'experts' who don't. I'm dubious of Dr. Palmer's claims for substantive reasons that I have previously stated. I was hoping to have an intelligent discussion on this topic. Instead, I got you. You can have the last word.

There is no doubt that about 60 percent of the warming that has occurred since 1850 occurred prior to 1940, when it couldn't have been caused by rising CO2 levels. Also, the hottest year on record in the USA, where the vast majority of the surface temperature stations are located, was 1937 -- at least until NOAA 'adjusted' their data to make the hottest year 1998, the year of the super El Nino. The GCMs assume that a doubling of CO2 to 800 ppm will result in a forcing of 1.1 watts/m2. This isn't controversial. What is controversial is the GCMs' assumption that this will result in a feedback forcing of about 3.4 watts/m2, due to evaporation of water vapor -- the dominant greenhouse gas, for a positive feedback gain of slightly over 3. This is absurd, since any system that has a positive feedback gain of greater than 1 becomes unstable and quickly crashes. If our atmosphere was that sensitive to changing temperatures, planet Earth would have either turned into a snowball or a replica of Venus many hundreds of thousands or even millions of years ago. I would assume that the 'tipping points' that Dr. Palmer refers to are other mechanisms that are holding things in check but that would be overwhelmed if the global temperature rises much higher. Why this didn't happen during the medieval warm period, or the roman warm period, or the egyptian warm period, or the minoan warm period, or the holocene maximum, all of which had temperatures at least as high, if not higher than our current temperature is a mystery. And you are correct that it is more like a political argument. Back in the 1970s, the liberal progressive environmental canard to justify wealth redistribution was 'global cooling'.

Data from ice forage in Greenland and Antarctica indicates that interglacial during the Pleistocene last on average 10ky. We are more than 11 thousand years into the current Holocene. So are we buying some more time before the next glacial maximum and if so then the current CO2 forcing on the climate might at the end be a good thing?

The bulk of evidence indicates that physical impacts of climate tend towards a dampening of outputs rather than acceleration. Current models, that ignore solar impacts among other issues, cannot explain &quot;the pause&quot; in global temperatures that has existed for the last 20 years, directly contrary to a continuing increase in atmospheric CO2. Using questionable climate models (and worst-case input assumptions) to scare people in order to push political agendas is immoral. Disputing the accuracy of climate models is not &quot;denying science&quot;, but objective comparison of model outputs to reality.

Anyway, it is representation bias, since what is important is global temperature, and global temperature didn't raise. It has been hot in summer in Europe, but this is a statistical fluctuation we are used to. It is because of the anticyclone on the Acores. In the same way there are streaks of cool summers, and even very rainy and cold summers. But they are averaged out in the year. Indeed, in France this year there are snowfalls more than a month early. Another strategy to scare people, which bares the bones of the political agenda.

Each I know isn't capable of predicting weather correctly for longer than 1 week and has troubles even with that. How can you predict then, what will happen in hundreds of years? Referring to my points: Ad.1) No. Human influence on climate can be barely distinguished among sampling and prediction noise. Even that isn't due to ~150ppm of CO2 change, but more to landscape transformation. Climate is constantly changing and mostly following activity of the Sun, activity of Earth (volcanism, continental drift) and Milankovitch cycles. Ad.2) No. CO2 level follows temp. It's the global ocean absorbing and emitting CO2 depending on temp. The process is slow - many centuries in length. We shouldn't even try to infer our CO2 contribution from any atmospheric measurements, but just count our extraction and consumption of Carbon-containing minerals, and identify final products, which remain in environment. Biosphere is constantly using and re-emitting CO2. Plants incorporate it. Water vapor is many times more potent greenhouse gas than CO2. Water appearance states are also crucial. Ad.3) We have no clue what to do, to save humankind and even whether we actually shall do anything. We have no idea how we could do it and what effects will our actions have. Looking at CO2 levels throughout ages, it's laughable to allege that it's any significant problem. The grave problem, no one talks about today is the coming end of current interglacial. When it happens, even with current technology, we may not be able to maintain the current level of development.

Judith Curry is one of a pathetically tiny number of scientists clinging onto these kinds of ideas. It's always the same ones. However much you may like her fairytales, there are tens of thousands of experts in climate science, atmospheric physics, planetary science, ecological science, paleoclimatology, and any number of related disciplines who would regard her views as misleading. When *every scientific organisation on the planet* is warning of something deeply serious going wrong that we need to fix if we are to have any chance of a healthy and prosperous future on this planet, and one or two scientists are saying no don't worry your pretty little head over that, even then I can understand why you'd choose to go with the reassuring one or two. If experts all over the world were warning about a type of construction being catastrophically unsafe, to the point that every engineering society on the planet made statements about the urgency of taking it seriously, it wouldn't be responsible to ignore them all listen to the reassuring minority. Even if you thought you were a genius and you were personally convinced it was safe, it still wouldn't be responsible – never mind if you knew you weren't an expert yourself. It's a big deal.

No scientific organisation acknowledges anything, only the IPCC acknowledges the seriousness of scientific organisations, and that's precisely were it goes foul. The IPCC is not a scientific organisation, it is a political one whose purpose is to advise the governments. We got exactly the contrary: the politicians, puppets of multi-billionaire people, advise the scientists by funding the "serious" scientific organisations. Water never flows upward.

The climate of the Earth is a very stable one, since it saw events of several orders of magnitude more important than man-made CO2. Indeed, glaciation periods is the maximum amplitude allowed, and we are in a inter-glaciation period. The worst we have to fear is cooling, not warming.

At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fkCo_trbT8&amp;t=24m16s">24:16</a> &quot;...most likely thing is cloud cover...&quot;. Happer sure fucked that one up big time. Nothing to do with cloud changes at all. It&#39;s that the tropical Pacific Ocean easterly trade winds started having higher average speed at 1995 AD due to a warming tropical Atlantic Ocean surface due to the global warming thing that&#39;s been going on. This is known by anybody who knows their arse from a hole in the ground (so none of you then). Happer&#39;s a worthless clown just like all you coal/oil shills. <br />---------------- <br />The Tropical Atlantic Ocean surface has warmed and has increased the intensity of the Tropical Pacific Ocean trade winds by 50% in under 30 years because the atmospheric circulation is coupled between the Tropical Atlantic Ocean and the Tropical Pacific Ocean, but the Tropical Atlantic Ocean and the Tropical Pacific Ocean aren&#39;t coupled because there&#39;s land in the way <br />ENSO is a massive feature of Earth&#39;s climate and the GMST trends have been: <br />+0.13 degrees / decade: UAH lower troposphere 1979-2017 <br />+0.17 degrees / decade: RSS lower troposphere 1979-2017 <br />+0.165 degrees / decade: Surface La Nina &amp; ENSO-neutral years 1970-2014 (me from GISTEMP) <br />+0.20 degrees / decade: Surface El Nino years 1966-1995 (me from GISTEMP) <br />+0.23 degrees / decade: Surface El Nino years 1995-2014 (me from GISTEMP, high uncertainty, sparse &amp; varied data points) <br />+0.18 degrees / decade: Surface average 1966-2014 (GISTEMP) <br />+0.11 degrees / decade: Ocean surface 1966-2014 (GISTEMP) <br />+0.047 degrees / decade: Ocean 0-300M depth 1966-2010 89 / 432 = 0.206 (me from various, Hadley, ORAS4, talk plots etc.) <br />+0.030 degrees / decade: Ocean 300-700M depth 1966-2010 76 / 576 = 0.132 (me from various, Hadley, ORAS4, talk plots etc.) <br />+0.026 degrees / decade: Ocean 700-1000M depth 1966-2010 (me from various, Hadley, ORAS4, talk plots etc.) <br />+0.15 degrees total increase: Ocean 0-1000M depth (me from various, Hadley, ORAS4, Matthew England talk plots etc.) <br />---------------- <br />+0.009 degrees / decade: Ocean 700-2000M depth 1966-2010 77 / 1872 = 0.0411 (me from various, Hadley, ORAS4, talk plots etc.) <br />Note the +0.23 degrees / decade for El Nino years since 1995 and only +0.165 degrees / decade for La Nina &amp; ENSO-neutral years. A big difference. <br />ENSO appears to have &quot;strengthened&quot; since 1995 due to Pacific trade winds (Easterlies) having started increasing in average speed since 1995 and now 1 m/s faster than before 1995. This was the main cause of the &quot;hiatus&quot; or &quot;pause&quot; between 1997/98 huge El Nino and very large 2015/16 El Nino. <br />---------------- <br />Quotes: &quot;Atlantic warming turbocharges Pacific trade winds Date:August 3, 2014 Source:University of New South Wales. New research has found rapid warming of the Atlantic Ocean, likely caused by global warming, has turbocharged Pacific Equatorial trade winds. Currently the winds are at a level never before seen on observed records, which extend back to the 1860s. The increase in these winds has caused eastern tropical Pacific cooling, amplified the Californian drought, accelerated sea level rise three times faster than the global average in the Western Pacific and has slowed the rise of global average surface temperatures since 2001. It may even be responsible for making El Nino events less common over the past decade due to its cooling impact on ocean surface temperatures in the eastern Pacific. &quot;We were surprised to find the main cause of the Pacific climate trends of the past 20 years had its origin in the Atlantic Ocean,&quot; said co-lead author Dr Shayne McGregor from the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science (ARCCSS) atthe University of New South Wales.&quot; <br />---------------- <br />Quotes: &quot;The record-breaking increase in Pacific Equatorial trade winds over the past 20 years had, until now, baffled researchers. Originally, this trade wind intensification was considered to be a response to Pacific decadal variability. However, the strength of the winds was much more powerful than expected due to the changes in Pacific sea surface temperature. Another riddle was that previous research indicated that under global warming scenarios Pacific Equatorial Trade winds would slow down over the coming century. The solution was found in the rapid warming of the Atlantic Ocean basin, which has created unexpected pressure differences between the Atlantic and Pacific. This has produced wind anomalies that have given Pacific Equatorial trade winds an additional big push. “The rapid warming of the Atlantic Ocean created high pressure zones in the upper atmosphere over that basin and low pressure zones close to the surface of the ocean,” says Professor Axel Timmermann, co-lead and corresponding author from the University of Hawaii. “The rising air parcels, over the Atlantic eventually sink over the eastern tropical Pacific, thus creating higher surface pressure there. The enormous pressure see-saw with high pressure in the Pacific and low pressure in the Atlantic gave the Pacific trade winds an extra kick, amplifying their strength. It’s like giving a playground roundabout an extra push as it spins past.” Many climate models appear to have underestimated the magnitude of the coupling between the two ocean basins, which may explain why they struggled to produce the recent increase in Pacific Equatorial trade wind trends. While active, the stronger Equatorial trade winds have caused far greater overturning of ocean water in the West Pacific, pushing more atmospheric heat into the ocean, as shown by co-author and ARCCSS Chief Investigator Professor Matthew England earlier this year. This increased overturning appears to explain much of the recent slowdown in the rise of global average surface temperatures. Importantly, the researchers don’t expect the current pressure difference between the two ocean basins to last. When it does end, they expect to see some rapid changes, including a sudden acceleration of global average surface temperatures. “It will be difficult to predict when the Pacific cooling trend and its contribution to the global hiatus in surface temperatures will come to an end,” Professor England says.&quot; <br />---------------- <br />Recent intensification of wind-driven circulation in the Pacific and the ongoing warming hiatus <br />Nature Climate Change 4, 222–227 (2014) doi:10.1038/nclimate2106 Received 11 September 2013 Accepted 18 December 2013 Published online 09 February 2014 Corrected online 14 February 2014 <br />Matthew H.

Bear with me here, please. Let's first agree that the magnitude of the greenhouse effect is determined by the *quantity* of gas that the radiative energy has to pass through, not merely the concentration. With that in mind, I'll offer a Gedankenexperiment to begin with, and maybe you can then suggest how we might make it more practical without departing from your remit. Does that sound ok? Construct two identical columns of air 10km high. Place identical tanks of earth at the base of each column, and arrange thermometers at various identical locations in each tank. (Ideally, these tanks would be a few km deep, with 70% water and 30% earth at the surface, but I think 10m depth of earth would be fine. The atmosphere is the important part.) Set the concentration of CO2 to 300ppm in one column and 400ppm in the other. Shine artificial sunlight down from the top of each column onto the tank, and monitor the temperatures over several years. We should also monitor the humidity in each tank, as water vapour is also a greenhouse gas. (Alternatively we could remove all water from the experiment and use dry gas and dry sand in the tanks. It depends on what we are trying to test.) The columns and the tanks must be perfectly insulated with perfectly reflecting sides, so that, the *only* way in which they can lose heat is through radiation and convection up through the full 10km high column of gas. The scale of this experiment is daunting, but it's not impossible to dig a bore hole a few km downwards. The most difficult part would be preventing the experiments from exchanging heat with their surroundings. The artificial sunlight will transfer heat to the tanks, and we need to ensure that the only way they can transfer this heat back out again is upwards through the entire column of air, as is the case for a planet. I think that would be an excellent way to test the difference between 300ppm and 400ppm atmospheres. Would that suit your remit? I'm open to your suggestions as to how we can make the experiment more practical without losing the physical characteristics that we want to investigate.

Only if you postulate a domino effect and circulus vitiosus causing the consecutive release of other climate gas sources and temperature raising factors you get to these frightening numbers. But each factor constitutes a different theory! We're expected to believe in all those theories like it was only one solid theory, just because ideologically biased scientists say so. That's the deception. It is disappointing that Frau Hossenfelder, whose claim to fame is critisizing biased science in the field of physics, loses her audaciousness in the face of climatologists.

This takes no calculation power at all and it takes no Einstein or Sherlock Holmes to ask and anawer this question. I can give you the answer: The lowerst, most accurate climate models like the russan INMCM series neglect Co2 as a climate driver.

The population as the "sacred cow" is the dangerous conclusion that this may lead to if the hysteria will even increase. It is what the prophets of doom are demanding already, the ones that say the IPCC is underestimating the threat. My take on this is that anti- human thinking is wrong since humans are not to seperate from nature and that technicaly it is already possible to live in harmony with nature, while emphasising on CO2 is a huge waste of energy and hinders actual progression in many aspects including enviromentalism.

He continues to agree that it might be better to compare these modells and draw conclusions in a stochastic way. This makes one wonder why exactly this is not done and why there is such a fractioned isolated knowledge and responsibility seperated among the groups, in other word a criticism towards the structure of the ipcc. Furthermore he admits that already topolgic barriers and cloud forming takes the modells and computers to their limits. All in all Palmer appears to be a bureaucrat, that involuntary stumbles over the own missing force of expression. His statement that the CO2 signal is clear is just a statement based on the very own axiomatical false assumption of the CO2 forcing. Towards a child i would have to explain that they are trying to calculate the whole planet, hence your term "complicated" and that for numerous reasons the CO2 signal is indeed lost in the noise in a sense of "climate uncertainty relation". Palmer comes to another confession: The tippingpoints become more important recently, since it is kind of the last alarmist resort. Finaly he comes to threats, that never came true and are contradicted by observations refering to drouts, wealths, storms, greening, extincton etc. pp. To a child i would have to explain that in our ice cores, temperature and CO2 are in an almost lockstep correlation and that the ipcc has a theory of feedback during an interglcial, that is nowhere readable. Looking further back, Ockham and Popper would suggest that CO2 fails to show the assumed ipcc forcing of CO2 at any given time in earth history, quite the opposite: There is only descrepancies. Ordovician ice age despite 6000 ppm, carboniferous flora CO2 absorption without a reacting temperature to the rapid CO2 decline for ~80 mio years. The whole mesozoic with declining CO2 with constant high temperatures. The mentioned icecores, where temperature rises first without changing the general, rapid trend after the subsequent CO2 release from the oceans. Even not today in GISS where we have a rise of warm from 1900 to 1940 comparable to 1980 -2019 WITHOUT the major emissions of man made CO2.

I regard consensus science as an extremely pernicious development that ought to be stopped cold in its tracks. Historically, the claim of consensus has been the first refuge of scoundrels; it is a way to avoid debate by claiming that the matter is already settled. Whenever you hear the consensus of scientists agrees on something or other, reach for your wallet, because you&#39;re being had.<br /><br />Let&#39;s be clear: the work of science has nothing whatever to do with consensus. Consensus is the business of politics. Science, on the contrary, requires only one investigator who happens to be right, which means that he or she has results that are verifiable by reference to the real world. In science consensus is irrelevant. What is relevant is reproducible results. The greatest scientists in history are great precisely because they broke with the consensus.<br /><br />There is no such thing as consensus science. If it&#39;s consensus, it isn&#39;t science. If it&#39;s science, it isn&#39;t consensus. Period.”~Michael Crichton	UC8BdmoAN8rXqZ0sgPF0I-1A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8BdmoAN8rXqZ0sgPF0I-1A	0

They should do the research and release the results whatever they are. Have others replicate results adds to their soundness. Science has advanced so research has become harder and often it takes a multitude to do the research. Sin is for the superstitious not the scientific.

Fraud. Academics won&#39;t get any funding unless they support the hypothesis (no proof by the way) that man made CO2 is causing significant climate warming. There are some excellent and principled scientists who are saying that the whole man made climate warming hypothesis is based on pseudo science. At the very least, we should be getting a more balanced argument presented to us but we are not. Why? It&#39;s an agenda. We can call it, &#39;Political Climate Change&#39;.

It could go out to six or seven or even more than that degrees. Now - again - six, seven&quot; <br />There are 18 paleo climate proxies that peg climate sensitivity at 2.4 to 4.8 degrees, so most likely close to 3.6 degrees. That&#39;s where climate sensitivity is derived. Of course the climate models tend to get a very similar range or they&#39;d be crap and they cost some tens or I think it&#39;s more like hundreds of millions of dollars each.

UgyNdrZB38sd6tmGxGZ4AaABAg	0	0	2019-11-23 00:45:45	Gary Raab	Fs = kx <br /> <br />Hooke&#39;s law is a law in physics that states that the force (F) needed to extend or compress a spring by some distance x scales linearly with respect to that distance. <br /> <br />Most of us have played with a spring, stretched it, ruined it; ruined meaning that the spring no longer acts like a normal spring. <br />Simple human behaviour! <br />In physics class, students may have experimented with masses hanging from a spring, developing a mathematical model that shows the relationship between force and displacement. The model is very consistent until too much mass is applied. The additional force once again spoils the spring, stretches it out of shape. <br /> <br />Both the physics student and the physics teacher recognized something has gone amok! <br /> <br />However, the physics student, and most likely the physics teacher, do not understand the quantum physics beyond the simple linear force, spring constant, and displacement relationship. <br />The learning endeavour usually does not extend past one or two trials. Satisfied that our understanding of springs is thought to be complete, we fail to ask the deeper questions , ‘What would happen if we changed the composition of the spring?’ or ‘What effect would warming the spring have?’ Asking why questions, and the investigating about complex systems makes our head hurt – literally. <br /> <br />Humans understand climate science to a much lesser extent then the physics of springs. <br /> <br />What do we humans have to do to begin to address changes in climate? <br /> <br />Once we stretch a spring, we have to play carefully with the next spring; having noticed drastic changes in regional climate, and experienced adverse consequences, we have to be increasingly mindful of possible human causes and future effects. <br /> <br />Memorizing Hooke’s law for a pop quiz, doesn’t make an one informed spring scientist. Once a spring stretches and no longer returns to its original form, does not negate Robert’s contribution to science. Similarly we must to do a deep dive into predictive climate models, to learn about the physics corresponding with multiple climate science variables, not just the CO2 variable. <br /> <br />There are a lot of environmental and economic reasons why we should reconsider the use of hydrocarbons, beyond simple combustion. If we mentally lock in on carbon dioxide, we will lock in to confirmation bias, a tendency to search for, interpret, favour, and recall information in a way that affirms one&#39;s prior beliefs; in this case, the reason for climate change. Cognitive bias and systematic error is related to inductive reasoning. People display this bias when they gather or remember information selectively, or when we interpret forward in a biased way. The effect is stronger for desired outcomes, for emotionally charged issues, and for deeply-entrenched beliefs. <br /> <br />Reducing hydrocarbon combustion may be ‘the essential step’, but locking in early, when ~99.999% of us know next to nothing about the physics of climate science, will limit the possibility of not only stopping or slowing climate change, but also interrupt the creative process of dealing with the future consequences of increasing climate change. <br /> <br />What are other possible reductions, besides hydrocarbon combustion that might be seriously considered? Use your imagination! Did we consider manipulating the population variable in the climate model? Are testosterone and estrogen variables worth consideration? <br /> <br />Far fetched? Who is James Clerk Maxwell? <br /> <br />The University of Chicago has a free introductory course online. Humans need a deeper understanding of climate science, the biosphere, and anthropomorphic factors; because even the best laid ‘economic’ plans cannot buy a new planet! <br /> <br />Spring into learning, go to: <br /> <br /><a href="http://forecast.uchicago.edu/lectures.html">http://forecast.uchicago.edu/lectures.html</a>	UCZ1OabcTC7vujsKsDm50jxQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ1OabcTC7vujsKsDm50jxQ	0

That isn&#39;t how the so-called &quot;greenhouse effect&quot; works. It doesn&#39;t matter for general discourse because the end result is the same. I could explain the particle physics at a mid level if anybody was interested but I think a workable, yet accurate enough, quickie summary for the public with a light science education or better (so good for British but no good for almost all U.S. of Americans because they have only a small educated elite atop a mass of human intellectual shit) is that LWR is a &quot;shimmer&quot; in the troposphere being fed both from the surface and from within the troposphere. Increased greenhouse gases (GHGs) causes the LWR which makes it to space to be from a higher altitude and LWR which makes it to surface to be from a lower altitude (because it&#39;s &quot;thicker&quot; so LWR cannot get through it quite as far as before, not to either end point, not to surface and not to space). Since the tropospheric temperature lapse rate has (generally, almost always) decreasing temperature with altitude this means the LWR is reaching the surface from a warmer average point in the troposphere and the LWR is reaching the space from a colder average point in the troposphere. This means more LWR reaching the surface and less LWR reaching space. That&#39;s what causes the TOA imbalance that causes the global warming that causes the climate change and the warming oceans and land sub-surface.

Sorry I&#39;m dumb&quot;. <br />----------------- <br />@Cameron Bradley No you&#39;re not dumb for being &quot;confused&quot; as you say by the Heller/Goddard crap. It&#39;s beyond miserable and as old as the hills. For example, Heller/Goddard is still spouting that old Monte Hieb drivel and having the chutzpah to call that old multi-debunked-for-a-decade crap &quot;Basic Science For Climate Scientists&quot;. Talk about fucking click bait. He pretends he understands some science with his lame wildly-incorrect &quot;explanations&quot; but all it does for knowledgeable persons with a functioning brain like mine is inform them that he&#39;s a silly-arse babbler. Every single bit of it is either irrelevant, or minuscule, or just general-purpose drivel. I could rip it to tatters but I no longer (since 5 years ago when I stopped bothering) waste my time simply because there&#39;s no audience in this venue. A quick scan of the comments here shows it&#39;s 99.9% coal/oil shill-fuckwits. They&#39;ve zero interest in science as you clearly see from every comment. They are all 100% socio-political wealth-driven-only arse holes, and that is an unchanging thing because persons don&#39;t change. They are what they are and this bunch in these comments and Heller/Goddard are the shit heap of human intellect, so no point for me. Heller/Goddard even massively contradicts here on the basic particle physics.........wait for it now.........no other than William Happer the infamous and quite intelligent coal/oil shill and an actual professional physicist. Now who would a coal/oil shill-fuckwit believe ? Their clown-idiot with the science education of a British 10 year old, Heller/Goddard, with his stupid contrived (hey, a &quot;model&quot; not data) massively-incorrect physics at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fkCo_trbT8&amp;t=17m13s">17:13</a> or William Happer who provides real absorption/emission physics in a talk and claims it&#39;s +2.65 w / m**2 for each CO2 doubling (the physicists that WG1 climate scientists use claim it&#39;s +3.71 w / m**2 for each CO2 doubling). Decisions, decisions, choose an actual physicist who&#39;s a card-carrying coal/oil shill recently hired into a government job in some country or other by the global coal/oil industry &amp; friends, or choose a pathetic babbling idiot (Heller/Goddard) ? Beats me. <br />-------- <br />Atmospheric temperature isn&#39;t what impacts the atmospheric carbon dioxide (your question). It&#39;s obvious to a person like me but is also explained by WG1 climate scientists in talks on GoogleTube. The temperature of the ocean and especially the Southern Ocean impacts the atmospheric carbon dioxide, not atmospheric temperature. All in the comments here are brain dead and Heller/Goddard pretends to be brain dead because he&#39;s a professional coal/oil shill pretending to do science so he has to pretend that he doesn&#39;t understand. They drive each other. It&#39;s a classic self-reinforcing +ve feedback loop same as happens all over the place with climate, same as hurricanes, same as ocean ice loss, same as the mighty ENSO, same as thermohaline circulation (THC). All of those are types of self-reinforcing +ve feedback loops, otherwise none of them would exist because they would be unable to build up. Atmospheric CO2 and ocean temperature drive each other in a classic self-reinforcing +ve feedback loop. They drive each other. ======They drive each other====. ======THEY DRIVE EACH OTHER====. ======THEY DRIVE EACH OTHER !!!!!!! ====. Tell the Heller/Goddard coal/oil shill-fuckwit &amp; all the coal/oil shill-fuckwits in the comments here THEY DRIVE EACH OTHER !!!!!!! They are all so fucking brain-dead stupid that it never even occurred to them that THEY DRIVE EACH OTHER !!!!!!! As the Southern Ocean warms it absorbs less atmospheric CO2 than it used to (it has been of late ~93 billion tonnes / year of atmospheric CO2 that the ocean and especially the Southern Ocean used to absorb). It is irrelevant what warms the Southern Ocean. The Southern Ocean neither knows nor cares what warmed it. As it gets warmer it&#39;s going to absorb increasingly less atmospheric CO2 and start helping humans increase the atmospheric CO2 instead. That&#39;s why the warming will greatly accelerate over the next few decades as the Southern Ocean warms. Humans have kick-started it by warming the surface/air and ocean by greatly increasing atmospheric CO2 &amp; CH4. The Southern Ocean will increasingly take over the job and it will become increasingly difficult for humans to stop it if they choose to stop it one day (like let&#39;s say a weird plague kills every single fucking U.S. of American and just leaves the rest of us, the cream of the human species, so we immediately act to make climate as affable as possible). So the Southern Ocean can be warmed by the cyclical change of the Milankovitch cycles or by anything at all that warms the Southern Ocean and the result is the same. <br />---------- <br />IT&#39;S A FUCKING CLASSIC SELF-REINFORCING +VE FEEDBACK LOOP SO IT DOESN&#39;T MATTER A MONKEY&#39;S FUCK WHETHER ATMOSPHERIC CO2 CAUSES WARMING 1ST OR SOUTHERN OCEAN WARMS 1ST, SAME RESULT EITHER WAY. <br />---------- <br />Same irrefutable science is available to debunk every single little snippet of Heller/Goddard&#39;s miserable torrent of non-stop worthless coal/oil shill-fuckwitted drivel he spouts in this video, not just from me but all over the place from intelligent experts for any person who cares to search for it.

No. The Greenland ice core Greenland surface temperature proxies (there are several) correlate poorly with the Antarctica ice core Antarctica surface temperature proxies because Greenland had 25 Dansgaard–Oeschger (DO) events jolting its surface temperature up &amp; down fast by a few degrees while Antarctica had no such thing because it&#39;s Atlantic Ocean currents that kick the Greenland surface temperature around. For anybody who is interested, one of the interesting talks about this is at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-YW8Y0ooPg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-YW8Y0ooPg</a> The NGRIP (one of the Greenland ice core sites) temperature proxy analysis plot and atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) proxy analysis plot graph is at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fkCo_trbT8&amp;t=5m22s">5:22</a> at that link I just typed. Enjoy that talk by Jerry. The long-term climate situation is very clearly that atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) has been the primary driver (the &quot;thermostat&quot;) over time scales of tens of millions to hundreds of millions of years, so with surface temperature averaging to a single average value over a medium-short time span of a couple of hundred thousand years or so, with the Sun increasing its radiation output by 0.065% every 10,000,000 years because Sun is a well-behaved star (a hydrogen nuclear-fusion machine) operating on the main sequence providing a steady warming ramp over the last ~4,600,000,000 years from Sun&#39;s energy increase overlaid with surface temperature swings over the shorter periods of tens of millions to hundreds of millions of years due to variations in the quantity of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and with a variety of very short events modifying average surface temperature greatly such as the notable Paleocene Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) which started 56,000,000 years ago and warmed average surface temperature a large 4-8 degrees in an eye blink of just 24,000 years and then took ~100,000 years to cool down again to where it was before (cause appears to be large methane (CH4) release for reason(s) still debated by experts). During the last couple of million years or so when these glaciation periods (&quot;ice ages&quot;) have been going on the most significant cause of warming &amp; cooling by far has been the ice sheets &amp; vegetation changes albedo-change feedback, with CO2 change feedback being half the amount of the ice sheets &amp; vegetation changes albedo-change feedback. The trigger that causes these changes is, as you all know, the Milankovitch cycles of orbital eccentricity, axial tilt &amp; precession of the equinoxes changes but this change in summer solar radiation at latitude 65N and thereabouts that pulls the trigger is a small factor and gets totally overwhelmed over the following hundreds &amp; thousands of years by the massive ice sheets &amp; vegetation changes albedo-change &amp; atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) feedbacks. The feedbacks take over after some brief period of a few hundred years of warming (or cooling when it&#39;s going into the glaciation period &quot;ice age&quot;) that&#39;s needed to get them going, and that&#39;s why the surface/air global average temperature change precedes the 3.4x-as-big atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) feedback change by ~400 to ~800 years. Here it is yet again because it&#39;s important for the portion of you who aren&#39;t coal/oil shill-fuckwits and therefore you are interested in this fascinating science. The most recent de-glaciation causes quantified. The top-of-atmosphere (TOA) forcings/feedbacks of the most recent de-glaciation were: <br />0.5 +- 1 w/m**2 8% Orbital eccentricity, axial tilt &amp; precession of the equinoxes changes <br /> forcing (what pulled the trigger that started it) <br />3.5 +- 1 w/m**2 53% ice sheets &amp; vegetation changes albedo-change feedback <br />1.8 +- 0.3 w/m**2 27% CO2 change feedback <br />0.4 +- 0.1 w/m**2 6% CH4 change feedback <br />0.4 +- 0.1 w/m**2 6% N2O change feedback <br />::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: <br />6.6 +- 1.5 w/m**2 total <br />That 6.6 w/m**2 of total imbalance plus water vapour &amp; cloud feedbacks is what increased Global Mean Surface Temperature (GMST) by ~5.0 degrees from the depths of the glaciation period &quot;Ice Age&quot; 20,000 years ago to the Holocene Optimum 8,000 years ago. Pretty simple stuff.	UCGcEOvg7z8aL9LvTH4QFnWA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGcEOvg7z8aL9LvTH4QFnWA	0

Muller&quot; at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNm1-GMWdlw&amp;NR=1&amp;feature=endscreen">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNm1-GMWdlw&amp;NR=1&amp;feature=endscreen</a> Does that sound like a classic &quot;alarmist&quot; talk to you ? What happened is (I think maybe 2009) several thousand emails were stolen from Hadley Centre and one from Phil Jones was found (allegedly by Russian interests) discussing the decline in quality of tree ring proxy data after ~1950 and how it could be smoothed into later instrumental data without a sudden &quot;funny&quot; jump and the email said something about &quot;hiding the decline&quot; in that tree ring proxy data that was clearly screwed up after ~1950. The professional coal/oil shills and the politicians in U.S. America who are owned by the industry chopped the long wording down to &quot;Mike&#39;s trick to hide the decline&quot; which was just bare-faced lying about the email wording because they massively changed it, but bare-faced lying with chutzpah is what the coal/oil shills do best (it&#39;s all they can do at all well). So U of C Berkeley professor Richard Muller gave talks (and later wrote in an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal) about &quot;Mike&#39;s trick to hide the decline&quot; saying essentially that it was outrageous poor science. Muller got funding from the Koch brothers coal/oil billionaires to do an analysis of Global Mean Surface Temperature (GMST) in order to show that NASA, HADCrut were all over-stating it either deliberately or by poor analysis or by poor stations such as &quot;urban heat island&quot;. U of C Berkeley professor Muller&#39;s BerkeleyEarth group analysis was performed with Koch brothers coal/oil billionaires funding to show how warming was greatly over-estimated and they found instead that it was already done well and their careful analysis was the same within a few percent. Mister Think&#39;s GMST plot at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fkCo_trbT8&amp;t=11m43s">11:43</a> is clearly annotated &quot;Based on Chart by Berkeley Earth&quot; which means it&#39;s Muller&#39;s group. So the reason why I&#39;m laughing here and your comment questioning Mister Think&#39;s choice of GMST plot at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fkCo_trbT8&amp;t=11m43s">11:43</a> is hilariously ironic is because that particular GMST analysis was directly funded by Charles &amp; David Koch, the coal/oil billionaires who have been paying whore scientists and funding coal/oil shills for years to the tune of tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars to lie about climate change either not happening or not being CO2-caused. That particular GMST plot at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fkCo_trbT8&amp;t=11m43s">11:43</a> that Mister Think chose (not that it matters, they all show the same) is one that was ==from work directly funded by the Koch brothers coal/oil billionaires specifically to prove that the existing ones from NASA &amp; HADCrut were faked to show way too much warming==. So LOL, LMFAO, DOUBLE LMFAO. So your comment questioning that specific GMST analysis is hilariously ironic. <br />------ <br />Anyway, that&#39;s Richard Muller&#39;s BerkeleyEarth group analysis and you can go to their site, and send them a donation if you like. There&#39;s also NASA GISTEMP, HadCrut, Cowtan &amp; Way variant, Remote Sensing Systems RSS AMSU TLT satellite data proxy analysis (the lower troposphere) and UAH AMSU TLT satellite data proxy analysis (the lower troposphere). And all of those show the same warming trend within a very few percent variation except UAH AMSU TLT satellite data proxy analysis by the self-professed coal/oil shill Roy Spencer mysteriously shows 30% lower than the others (it now, version V6.0, shows +0.129 degrees / decade). RSS AMSU TLT satellite data proxy analysis of the very same data shows essentially the same as all the surface/air analyses (it shows very slightly more, may be 5% more if memory serves). I&#39;m not saying outright that the self-professed coal/oil shill Roy Spencer is a crook falsifying it. I think it&#39;s just that he&#39;s only marginally competent. His V5.0 was showing &gt;30% higher warming rate than this and he was saying what he showed then was correct of course then all of a sudden his V6.0 version appears and it&#39;s showing &gt;30% lower warming rate than his V5.0 which he had said was correct. Now apparently that one was wildly incorrect and this new one is correct. It&#39;s fun eh this shitty UAH satellite data proxy analysis ? It changes by &gt;30% overnight. It&#39;s pretty random.

You aren&#39;t following the social aspect that has glued itself to this particular science in an effort to fuck it up for their personal wealth interest only. It&#39;s that they don&#39;t care in the fucking slightest whether they are &quot;being fed lies&quot; as you type or getting valid science because they have zero interest in the topic. Absolutely zero interest in the topic from any of them at all. Their interest is absolutely 100% socio-political-wealth based and they&#39;ve decided what is best for their wealth/life/fun with zero regard for anything else at all, all of them, no exceptions, I&#39;ve been carefully studying their responses to me and others for 7 years, I&#39;ve carefully studied thousands of those for any hint of an interest at all in the science, there is none, zero. So, with this being demonstrably, with utter certainty, the case as they all (no exceptions) demonstrate continuously the last 7 years to my knowledge (so actually somewhat longer) all they need then is constant ==excuses== which will ==always== be provided by those who make wealth directly by concocting those excuses (a new profession for this has come into existence) and funded by those wealthiest who have the most to gain/lose by alteration of their vast wealth. So it isn&#39;t in the slightest that &quot;they are unaware they are being fed lies&quot; but that they don&#39;t have the slightest interest. You can never, ever, ever convince somebody of scientific facts when they have decided (== rightly or wrongly ==) that their best personal wealth interest depends on them not understanding it.

Ugxje1Pz8b3UG2Exkih4AaABAg	0	0	2019-11-22 22:54:51	grindupBaker	From: &lt;My super hero secret identity redacted&gt; Sent: Saturday, November 11, 2017 4:00 PM To: support-AT-remss-DOT-com &lt;link changed to see if that lets it post in comments&gt; <br />Subject: STAR MSU onboard calibration procedure mismatches a solid-housed thermometer placed in the atmosphere <br />If I&#39;m understanding the STAR microwave sounding unit (MSU/AMSU) onboard calibration procedure correctly, then it measures a different physical aspect of Earth&#39;s atmosphere than is measured by a thermometer (either liquid-expansion or platinum-resistance) and it measures a lesser physical aspect. The underlying reason for the difference is that there is no long-wave radiation (LWR) inside a solid such as a platinum-resistance thermometer. I&#39;ve never heard a climate scientist mention this. <br />If the lower tropospheric (for example) atmosphere warms then there is an anomaly in these forms of energy: <br />- molecular kinetic energy (molecular translational energy, heat), <br />- LWR energy, <br />- molecular vibrational energy of the GHGs (primarily H2O in the gaseous form). <br />The warm target in a MSU/AMSU is a solid blackbody whose temperature is measured by platinum resistance thermometers embedded in it. The microwave flux density from it is used to scale microwave flux density (thermal emission) from molecules (primarily oxygen) in the atmosphere. The issue I see is that this onboard calibration procedure causes the instrument to scale such that it measures only molecular kinetic energy (molecular translational energy, heat) in the atmosphere and excludes LWR energy and molecular vibrational energy of the GHGs in the atmosphere. This means that differentiation over time of this proxy measures only heat anomaly. <br />A liquid-expansion or platinum-resistance thermometer placed in the atmosphere at elevation 2m (for example) above ocean or land surface measures: <br />- molecular kinetic energy (molecular translational energy, heat) plus <br />- LWR energy plus <br />- molecular vibrational energy of the GHGs (primarily H2O in the gaseous form) <br />because LWR energy and molecular vibrational energy of the GHGs are transmuted to molecular kinetic energy (molecular translational energy, heat) upon impacting upon the molecules of the solid and I understand that there is no transverse electromagnetic radiation inside a solid. Placement of the thermometer inside an enclosure does not exclude the LWR energy and molecular vibrational energy of the GHGs due to GHG molecule collisions. <br />Thus, differentiation over time of the liquid-expansion or platinum-resistance thermometer proxies for temperature measures the sum of all three anomalies but differentiation over time of the microwave flux density (thermal emission) from molecules (primarily oxygen) in the atmosphere at the example elevation of 2m measures only the molecular kinetic energy (molecular translational energy, heat) anomaly with the STAR microwave sounding unit (MSU/AMSU) onboard calibration procedure as described. In order for the MSU/AMSU to measure the same physical aspect as a liquid-expansion or platinum-resistance thermometer it would be necessary to calibrate with the warm target being atmospheric gases in close proximity to a solid whose temperature is measured by platinum-resistance thermometers, or a compensating adjustment could be made during analysis such as RSS and UAH based upon the ratio of LWR energy + molecular vibrational energy of GHGs to molecular kinetic energy in the atmosphere. <br />Please inform whether: <br />1) I&#39;m misunderstanding the physics, or <br />2) I&#39;m not including another aspect of STAR microwave sounding unit (MSU/AMSU) onboard calibration procedure that deals with this issue, or <br />3) A compensating adjustment for this is made during analysis such as RSS and UAH based upon the ratio of LWR + molecular vibrational energy of GHGs energy to molecular kinetic energy in the atmosphere, or <br />4) The ratio of LWR + molecular vibrational energy of GHGs energy to molecular kinetic energy in the atmosphere is so negligible (far less than uncertainties) that no compensating adjustment for it is required for analysis such as RSS and UAH. <br />Thanks	UCGcEOvg7z8aL9LvTH4QFnWA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGcEOvg7z8aL9LvTH4QFnWA	0

The stratosphere is cooling. The 1st gives the quantity and the 2nd gives the cause. Only an increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHGs) can simultaneously warm the oceans, warm the troposphere and cool the stratosphere. <br />An increase in solar radiation cannot simultaneously warm the oceans, warm the troposphere and cool the stratosphere. <br />A decrease in global average cloud cover cannot simultaneously warm the oceans, warm the troposphere and cool the stratosphere. <br />A decrease in air pollution aerosols cannot simultaneously warm the oceans, warm the troposphere and cool the stratosphere. <br />No increased form of energy entering Earth&#39;s atmosphere from space can simultaneously warm the oceans, warm the troposphere and cool the stratosphere. <br />No decreased form of energy entering Earth&#39;s atmosphere from space can simultaneously warm the oceans, warm the troposphere and cool the stratosphere. <br />No increased form of geothermal heat can simultaneously warm the oceans, warm the troposphere and cool the stratosphere. <br />An increase in heat leaving the oceans cannot simultaneously warm the oceans, warm the troposphere and cool the stratosphere. <br />Only increased atmospheric GHGs can simultaneously warm the oceans, warm the troposphere and cool the stratosphere, and that is what&#39;s been happening the last 50 years. <br />It&#39;s the smoking gun for increased atmospheric GHGs being the cause.

Measured in parts per million, your 0.04% is 400 ppm, which is high, causing the rapid heating. During glacial periods, co2 was 180 ppm, other periods about 280 ppm. Remember, toxins have toxicities measured in parts per million (ppm). Lead poisoning begins at 0.1 ppm. Co2 in your blood should about 1 ppm — higher may mean Cushing syndrome, kidney failure, metabolic alkalosis, or adrenal gland problems. Lower, and you may have Addison’s disease. Seemingly small numbers don’t mean small effects. One base pair change on chromosome 11 results in Down’s syndrome, Or Huntington disease, BRCA2 is breast cancer.

Heat is the transfer of thermal energy and energy cannot be created or destroyed. If something is being cooled, something else must be getting warmer; and vice versa. If you're air conditioning your home, you must be heating the air outside. Boiling water is cooling the water in the pot as it converts other water into steam. Ice on lakes is made by extracting thermal energy from the water, heating the air above it, and the water below it. To understand temperature and heat transfer, you need to know the properties of the substances involved, their mass, their density, the temperature gradients.

To cut the 90 x 90 km shoe box containing each current set of its values every 15-minutes (the time slice) to say 9 x 9 km needs a computer that&#39;s 10,000x as fast as today&#39;s super-computers, 10x for each of the 4 dimensions, without breaking the bank by paying $500,000,000,000 for each one rather than the El Cheapo $50,000,000 that each computer simulation climate model super-computer now costs. It&#39;s that simple. So what happens when you write a computer program for that is that you can have a value for average cloud in the box that&#39;s 90 x 90 x 1 km (I&#39;m just guessing 1,000 m for a tallness) and it&#39;s like a screen pixel you are seeing, it&#39;s just one homogenous fuzz. You could also have a formula like c = a + b*x + c*y + d*x**2 + e*y**2 + f*x**2 + g*y**2 (or whatever, that&#39;s just an ad hoc example) where c == cloud amount x,y,z are space coordinates within the shoe box and a,b,c,d,e,f,g are the variables (the coefficients of the equation) updated each 15-minute time slice to describe the cloud in each part of the box with good accuracy, obviously a far more accurate cloud parameterization than just the one homogenous fuzz. However, you can see that the computational time for doing c = a + b*x + c*y + d*x**2 + e*y**2 + f*x**2 + g*y**2 by updating a,b,c,d,e,f,g for the 5,000,000 shoe boxes for Earth in a climate model each 15 minutes for 100 years (17,534,000,000,000 of those computations in total) would take far longer than a simple c&lt;new&gt; = c&lt;old&gt; + c&lt;change&gt; to get the new homogenous fuzz each 15 minutes, and of course it&#39;s far worse than that because the 6 boundary surfaces of each shoe box would need to communicate the massively-more-complex non-constant boundary cloud situation to the 6 adjoining shoe boxes. So then why not just make the shoe boxes smaller and keep the homogenous fuzz cloud pixel but have 16x as many pixels ? It depends on which is less computation overall for a 100 year run. ==== And that is the sort of choice to be made for each parameter --- temperature, wind speed, direction, humidity, gas mixture, and so on, in each shoe box, and I know this because I&#39;ve faced that question my self in my simple Java simulation of persons moving randomly in large commercial, institutional &amp; residential buildings and I&#39;ve made my parameterization choices. I could use discrete Objects because my reality being simulated was so small so I could have Person Objects with differing qualities and situations for each but they can&#39;t have a Droplet Object set up even in a super-computer because there&#39;s 13,000,000,000,000,000 kilograms of water vapour in Earth&#39;s atmosphere so how many fucking cloud Droplet Objects would you need in Java (or Fortran equivalent) to precisely match Earth&#39;s clouds ? Can&#39;t be done, not even close. Fortunately though it isn&#39;t necessary to Objectify each cloud droplet and other minuscule components to get the various aspects of climate projection as accurate as needed for practical purposes. Just needs highly-accurate physics (like how about knowing something at least about large ice sheet dynamics guys, preferably before all the fucking ice is gone so it becomes just academic) and a much much smaller grid box &amp; time slice than 90 x 90 x 1 km x 15 minutes. The only alternative is to do what the pan-dimensional white mice did when Deep Thought got the ultimate answer but said a digital computer can&#39;t solve the ultimate question and that&#39;s commission Slartibartfast to build a custom planet, fill it with one species that&#39;s a worthless pile of fucking half wits, some other random nice species like effelumps, spin it up and let er rip. It&#39;s a bit pricey but that&#39;s what I&#39;d do.	UCGcEOvg7z8aL9LvTH4QFnWA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGcEOvg7z8aL9LvTH4QFnWA	0

Ugxb2_KXV1XUt02dt4l4AaABAg	0	0	2019-11-22 22:44:24	grindupBaker	John Weiss: &quot;How does the modern maximum of cosmic rays correlate with earth cloud cover?&quot;. <br />@John Weiss I recall seeing a graph in which cosmic rays correlate well with Earth cloud cover (perhaps it was only low cloud cover) over the quasi-11-year solar cycle. It seems to be universally accepted that solar activity has an effect on cosmic ray flux at Earth&#39;s TOA, and that&#39;s sensible of course. I&#39;ve also seen a plot somewhere showing a correlation of Earth&#39;s cloud cover (perhaps it was only low cloud cover) with the quasi-11-year solar cycle, which would be sensible at least because there&#39;s a tiny fraction of 1 degree warming &amp; cooling due to the quasi-11-year solar cycle that can be seen if the much-larger ocean current cycles and the global warming trend are filtered out. The issue is that the plot I recall seeing a few years back didn&#39;t have a scale for the cloud cover so I&#39;ve no way of knowing whether it&#39;s a minor Global Mean Surface Temperature (GMST) cycle effect such as +/- 0.03 degrees or whether it&#39;s a minuscule Global Mean Surface Temperature (GMST) cycle effect such as +/- 0.003 degrees, all that can be seen is the shape of the correlation of Earth&#39;s cloud cover (perhaps it was only low cloud cover) with the quasi-11-year solar cycle. Of course, as you all know, the WG1 climate scientists do think that low cloud cover decreases as the Global Mean Surface Temperature (GMST) increases but the amount is poorly known (a ~20% +ve feedback by my own calculations over the last few years) so this supports the idea that higher solar activity would result in less low cloud cover, which would result in low cloud cover having a quasi-11-year cycle synchronized with the quasi-11-year solar cycle. <br />-------------------- <br />So here&#39;s how the coal/oil shills work the scam with that one (it&#39;s so obvious that you&#39;ve all guessed already you brainy Thinkers). If you plot on a graph a plot of solar activity, a plot of galactic cosmic ray (GCR) flux at Earth and a plot of cloud cover (perhaps it was only low cloud cover) for a few consecutive quasi-11-year solar cycles, then you see the quasi-11-year solar cycle correlation between all three plots. Then what you (the coal/oil shill) do is quite simply === remove the quasi-11-year solar cycle plot ===. So now you just have the plot of galactic cosmic ray (GCR) flux at Earth and plot of cloud cover (perhaps it was only low cloud cover) and they correlate so you say &quot;cloud cover can&#39;t affect GCR flux but they correlate so GCR flux is affecting cloud cover&quot;. It&#39;s a cute little scam and I saw it done in at least one junk-science presentation by a coal/oil shill. It&#39;s another nice little meme prepared for parroting by the shitty army of worthless coal/oil shill-fuckwits who have zero, absolutely zero, interest in this science, and for parroting by the Russian trolls so, like the other items in the large eclectic mix of their total bull shit, it does the job. It&#39;s useful information for the few of you who aren&#39;t coal/oil shill-fuckwits because any time you see a person present a plot of GCR flux and cloud cover and it has a cycle of ~11 years for both, but no solar activity is plotted on the graph (or carefully explained) then you know for certain that the presenter is a coal/oil shill and everything in the talk will be concocted disinformation bull shit. I&#39;ve developed a few dozen such items over the years that inform me within seconds whether the talker or writer is just a worthless coal/oil shill spouting concocted disinformation bull shit. It&#39;s handy and fun.	UCGcEOvg7z8aL9LvTH4QFnWA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGcEOvg7z8aL9LvTH4QFnWA	0

However there was no real explanation as to how it is a &quot;statement of fact&quot; that man is responsible for warming the climate. If you start with this as your premise without a proper explanation then the debate is meaningless and reminds me of the citizens assemblies I witnessed in Ireland, discussing climate change policies. <br />The graphs at best show a limited ability to forecast overall trends over a very short timeframe, and in my opinion demonstrate their inaccuracies , particularly towards the <br /> A statement that present migration from the third world has an element of climate change is merely an opinion and disregards the socio economics which are far more relevant. <br />The EU flag beside his desk gives an indication of his bias.

Fortunately though it isn&#39;t necessary to Objectify each cloud droplet and other minuscule components to get the various aspects of climate projection as accurate as needed for practical purposes. Just needs highly-accurate physics (like how about knowing something at least about large ice sheet dynamics guys, preferably before all the fucking ice is gone so it becomes just academic) and a much much smaller grid box &amp; time slice than 90 x 90 x 1 km x 15 minutes. The only alternative is to do what the pan-dimensional white mice did when Deep Thought got the ultimate answer but said a digital computer can&#39;t solve the ultimate question and that&#39;s commission Slartibartfast to build a custom planet, fill it with one species that&#39;s a worthless pile of fucking half wits, some other random nice species like effelumps, spin it up and let er rip. It&#39;s a bit pricey but that&#39;s what I&#39;d do.	UCGcEOvg7z8aL9LvTH4QFnWA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGcEOvg7z8aL9LvTH4QFnWA	0

They are tested in the laboratory, they are tested in producing the daily weather, they are tested predicting the path of hurricanes, they are testing against the past by running simulations with know past data, and determining if the result conforms the past results which are known.  In fact, most advances are based on computer modeling, today. Computer modeling is far cheaper and more accurate than building and testing mock-ups. Aeronautical engineers, marine engineers, bridge engineers, architects, vehicle engineers, computer chip engineers, etc all build and design their products on computers. The days of wind-tunnels for testing plane and jet designs are long past. It conforms 100% to the scientific method.

You’re not. It’s so transparent that you have a political interest in disagreeing with climate science but you don’t want to be seen as a science denier, so you spin this bullshit yarn that the subject is just too complicated for the science to be valid. It’s not. You’re just a science denier if you think the greenhouse gases theory is too complex to be sure about. There are plenty of subjects that are far more complex than climate science and they still have no problem producing basic scientific principles. Obviously there are the finer details and intricacies to every subject that are more advanced. For example, there is nothing complicated about the reasoning behind why climate change will cause increased extreme weather events. Mapping out the exact frequency, type, causes and intricacies of those weather events however, is much more difficult and much more prone to error. But just because the details are more complex than the basic principle, that doesn’t mean you should treat the basic principle as though it’s also complex, because it isn’t, and certainly not as though it’s less true just because the validity of the details have wider error bars, because that’s not logical at all. That’s where your thinking is wrong. Greenhouse gases is a simple principle. It is very basic stuff that there are greenhouse gases that cause our atmosphere to trap more heat than it releases to space. There’s nothing complicated about the methodology or evidence we have for that basic principle, and just because there are other aspects to climate science that are more complicated, it doesn’t make the basic principle of greenhouse gases any less true. You just want to believe there is because then you can feel justified in denying it. There isn’t and you’re not.

On the one hand, global temperature rise will increase migration from poorer nations to richer Western ones. Both leftwing and rightwing governments could get more power from this: leftwing ones because migrants tend to vote left, rightwing ones because migrants scare natives into being more supportive of the right. On the other hand, such migration will foment conflict and threaten governments (leftwing and rightwing!) with destabilization and collapse. So if governments want to maintain their power, they should focus on combatting climate change. The alternative is post-collapse anarchy—which probably isn't that great for citizens either. And, you also have to consider that, even if a government wants to obtain more power, they might still believe in delusional things, like climate change being a hoax.

They have a 90 x 90 km grid size and a 15-minute time slice and those are too coarse to capture some climate items accurately. The famous Gulf Stream surface current is narrower at some places than that 90 x 90 km grid size so obviously that can&#39;t be modelled very accurately.

There was hothouse climate with liquid oceans in the precambrian, hence the therm "paradox". The 4% lesser sun does not change the fact that both equilibriums happened in the fashion as all following Ice ages and hot hous ages. The assumed forcings of CO2 are contradicted in every period. Even more so if the sun brightend up towards 100% today. There is always a hothouse equilibrium unless there is landmasses at the poles, like in the ordovician, permian, carboniferus and cenozoic. Everything else is transition between these 2 temperature equilibria. The tempearture gives jack shit of what CO2 does, obviously. In every glacial period, CO2 is sucked out of the atmosphere, due to ocean solibity, even at 6000ppm. Schark et.al 2019 hirnation event.

In the carboniferus CO2 dropped like a stone due to land flora explosion, temperature stayed high for millions of years. In the jurassic we have a meeting, CO2 rises while temperature drops. In the cretateous we have the highest discrepancy between CO2 and temperature. There is a general rapid trends towards warming when there is no landmasses at the poles. There is zero evidence for our warming to be unusual, even in a modern scale like GISS you can see a comparable warming from 1900 to 1940, before the main emissions.

A theory of gravitation is a set of equations and principles that should predict all gravitational phenomena. That's it. What else would you ask from a theory of gravitation???? Newton's law of universal gravitation was believed to do that for a long while. The fact that it was replaced is that it turned out to be an approximation and a theory with a wider range of validity came about. You say that what makes GR a theory and Newton's not a theory is that GR has "more profound principles", that is "nicer" than just saying that gravity is explained by an instantaneous force proportional to mM/r^2. WHO CARES if one finds the principles of GR more "profound" or "nicer". IT DOES NOT MATTER. I know you will say "but there was no explanation behind GmM/r^2, but there IS an explanation behind Einstein's GR, the principle of general covariance". But this is complete bs. Because obviously one can ask "but what explains that general covariance should be true?? What is the profound reason behind that?" And of course, there is no more an answer to this as there was an answer for why F= G mM/r^2 seemed to work. So saying that the principle of general covariance proves that GR is a theory whereas Newton's law of gravity was not because there was no explanation as to where it came from is complete bulls*t. Because there is no explanation as to whether general covariance should be valid. And of course, in many approaches to quantum gravity, general covariance is just an approximation so we don't know yet if it will survive as a fundamental principle. What matters are the predictions of the theory and whether they fit experiment. Th fact that someone might find the principles of GR more "profound" does not matter. Newton's theory was as much a theory of gravitation as GR because it gave in principle a description of all gravitational phenomena. The fact that you find nicer general covariance does not make GR more of a theory as Newton's universal gravitation.

A theory is a theory. Newton's theory (that F= GmM/r^2) explained Kepler laws, yes. Einstein's theory explained the perihelion of Mercury and the bending of light by the Sun. There are principles behind Einstein's theory. And there are principle between Newton's theory (that there is an instantaneous forces between any two masses, that's it's an inverse square law etc). I guess you will say that the principles of GR (like general covariance) are more profound and more correct than the ones of Newton. This is true but it does not make Newton's theory less of a theory. It is just a simpler and flawed theory. And we know that GR is itself flawed, so there has to be more fundamental principles at work. That does not mean that it is not a theory, it is just flawed. Why the heck would it matter if a theory is constructed first to explain observations? It does not make it less of a theory. If you were right, that would mean that if someone had come up with Einstein's equations by starting with explaining the perihelion of Mercury, and then discovering the principles behind them , it would make them less of a theory.

This is an approximation to Einstein's general relativity which is more than sufficient to use in climatology. Even when men were sent to the Moon, all calculations were done using Newton's law of gravity, not Einstein's. You are right that all laws of physics are models. But a successful model is one that can explain many observations with relatively few adjustable parameters. A good model has all its adjustable parameters determined by a certain number of observations and is THEN used to make predictions of some results, which are then confirmed. But when you have a model with several dozens of adjustable parameters that you use fit the results to one set of data, and that the uncertainties from all these parameters is not provided, the whole thing loses credibility, it is not objective science anymore.

This is the trouble with listening to scientists who live in silos... they forget about earth history (CO2 concentrations were 15 times higher when life began on earth), biology (CO2 has greened the planet by ~25%, and makes plants more drought resistant), &amp; recent history ... that weather was more severe in the recent past (look at almost any Tony Heller video showing that from news reports), and nothing today compares. CO2, if it has had any effect at all, has probably decreased severe weather. The wind blows hardest between cold and hot, not between cool and warm. Global warming will warm the cold regions much more than making hot places hotter. That means less severe weather. I want everyone to enjoy their work, but climate scientists seem to fall into that category of people who want to be recognized as prophets and saviors rather than scientists and theorists.

They have a 90 x 90 km grid size and a 15-minute time slice and those are too coarse to capture some climate items accurately. The famous Gulf Stream surface current is narrower at some places than that 90 x 90 km grid size so obviously that can't be modelled very accurately. I assume you know that computer simulation "climate models" are ==not== how it's found that Earth's Global Mean Surface Temperature (GMST) increase CO2 doubled is going to be between 2.4 and 4.8 degrees, most likely 3.6 degrees. That's been worked out from 18 paleo climate analyses going back over all sorts of time scales to times when this or some similar warming or cooling happened before (except, of course, much much much much much much much much much much much much much much much much much much slower than it's warming now).

The argument I miss is: why is the temperature warming due to CO2 and not the CO2 rising due to warm temperature?<br />How do they know this?<br />Is this either black or white, but nothing in-between?<br /><br />Then, how is temperature warming on the surface affecting the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere?<br />Other than CO2, clouds are something tangible, something everyone can observe in ones daily life: in winter/night cloudy weather keeps you warm, in summer/day cloudy weather keeps you cool ..., meaning it works both ways, space to earth and earth to space.<br />Since CO2 and water vapour are both greenhouse gases, why would CO2 work differently? (respectively they&#39;ve been both classified as greenhouse gases because of their similar influence on the temperature of atmosphere.)<br />Why would be a rising CO2 level bad, since it does the same like water vapour?<br />Are clouds bad for the global climate?<br />Or is an humid and warm environment rather favourable for life?<br />Why is having the earth&#39;s surface reflecting radiation back into space through an atmosphere without greenhouse gases, better than keeping the energy within the system?<br />Are deserts and glaciers the ideal condition from the perspective of a climate scientists?<br /><br />Now, do humans influence the climate through their ... existence on the planet?<br />Probably?<br />But, so what?<br />Can &quot;science&quot; effectively stop climate from changing? <br />I guess not.<br />Then why bother pretending to be able to stop it GLOBALLY, instead of dealing with it, timely, regionally and most important ...

G.	@Lawrence Winkler I'd like to give you an example: This is an article explaining how Global Warming works: https://www.livescience.com/58203-how-carbon-dioxide-is-warming-earth.html This paragraph is from the article: " The physics of greenhouse gases Carbon dioxide is no dark-horse candidate for the warming of the atmosphere. In 1896, Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius (who would later win the first-ever Nobel Prize for Chemistry) published a paper in the Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science that laid out the basics of what's now known as "the greenhouse effect." The effect is a result of how energy interacts with the atmosphere. Sunlight enters the atmosphere as ultraviolet and visible light; some of this solar energy is then radiated back toward space as infrared energy, or heat. The atmosphere is 78 percent nitrogen and 21 percent oxygen, which are both gases made up of molecules containing two atoms. These tightly bound pairs don't absorb much heat. But the greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, water vapor and methane, each have at least three atoms in their molecules. These loosely bound structures are efficient absorbers of the long-wave radiation (also known as heat) bouncing back from the planet's surface. When the molecules in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases re-emit this long-wave radiation back toward Earth's surface, the result is warming." Following questions: 1. is the sun only emitting radiation as ultraviolet and visible light? 2. are the greenhouse gas molecules only re-emitting that "long-wave" radiation, the heat reflected from earth (I guess they mean infrared waves) back to earth? 3. Assuming the answer to the first question is "No" - which it is - wouldn't the infra-red radiation (heat) coming from the sun also be absorbed by greenhouse gas molecules and the re-rediated, ... in some direction? Do you remember, in my first comment I mentioned clouds (water vapour) blocking the heat from the sun above them in summer/day while keeping the heat from the earth below them in winter/night, and was asking why should CO2 work differently. Now again, WHY? Which body is emitting more infrared waves, the earth or the sun? In other words: is the earth emitting or receiving more infrared (heat)? And then: WHY is that article suggesting that the sun is emitting only ultraviolet and visible light waves?

G.	@Lawrence Winkler I see, you make the argument that solar radiation captured by solar panels, which convert it into electricity, which I then used to have a radio playing music for me, in fact ends up being re-rediated at a frequency which isn't in the initial rage of the solar radiation. I agree. As I said, I don't think that's that simple. However, I was talking about direkt re-radiation, meaning a wave hitting an atom/molecule would either pass through, be absorbed (transformed) or be re-radiated depending on its frequency. Are those re-radiated (better: reflected) frequencies outside the frequency range of the solar radiation? I wasn't talking about transformation. So, what's the role of CO2 in all this? If I get it right a CO2 molecule absorbs a certain frequency from the solar radiation and transforms it. My point is: what happens to a wave at that frequency if it does not hit a CO2 molecule on its way through the atmosphere? (which is more likely that hitting one) Is there a guaranty that it does not hit something else on its way or on the surface, which absorbs/transforms it? I am not saying that when that certain frequency hits the CO2 molecule, it does not cause what the Climate Chance science (actually chemistry and physics) says it does. This is indisputable. My question is: what happens to that energy carried by a wave at that certain frequency when it does not hit a CO2 molecule? Is it as simple as: either it hits CO2 and gets "absorbed" into the system OR the wave gets re-radiated out of the system by the surface taking its energy with it? PS: sound waves may have a different frequency but need mater to propagate. neither the ringing of your bell nor the music coming out of my radio speakers would end up leaving the earth ;-)	UCt3jNIAGhbSv478wNKneeuA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt3jNIAGhbSv478wNKneeuA	1	Ugysnw8nqRyD0cR-x814AaABAg	CL.

Does the earth re-radiate the solar radiation which is not within the spectrum of the solar radiation itself? Yes! If I strike a bell with a hammer it radiates sound independent of the frequency with which I hit it with a hammer -- it rings for a very long time based on a single hammer strike and the frequencies radiated are based on the bell material and its geometry. Hit a nail with the hammer with the same force and the radiated sound is quite different from the bell. This is whole science of spectroscopy, which is the study of the interaction of matter and electromagnetic radiation. The spectroscopic interactions can be classified into Absorption, Emission, Elastic (reflection), Impedance, Inelastic (this is where the shift in wavelength (~~ frequency) occurs), and Coherent.  Everything around you proves what you claim isn't true. Even the simple incandescent light bulb proves this. Neon bulbs, florescent lighting, LED lighting, Lasers, TVs, computer screens, radio waves, X-rays, MRIs. These all involve the controlled interaction of electromagnetic radiation (often in the form electric current) with atoms and molecules of different gases, solids and liquids, to produce light and often heat (like the heat waste from incandescent bulbs).

G.	@Lawrence Winkler may be. but! does the earth re-radiate the solar radiation at a frequency which is not within the spectrum of the solar radiation itself? Which frequencies would be that? Anyway, I guess not. Also, CO2 (and the other greenhouse gases) absorbs a certain range of frequencies - something what every atom and molecule does. It absorbs it when it comes from the sun or after it gets re-radiated from something on the earth's surface. Therefore the idea would be that that frequency range absorbed/transformed by the CO2 molecules (which would be how many % to the entire spectrum) is the key frequency for heating up the planet, and would otherwise - in absence of greenhouse gases - be entirely re-reflected from the earth. Do I get this right? Anyway, the entire idea seems to me pretty simple, somehow black & white: we get rid of CO2 everything will change the way we assume. I don't think that it is that simple ... I do not dispute that there is a correlation between CO2 and temperature. However the chain of causalities responsible for the correlations isn't proved in my opinion. For example it could be something else causing both to rise or fall at the same time ... Like, let's say, the amount of in-coming solar radiation. Regardless of the changes in earth's orbit and the regular solar min/max, wasn't the sun constantly changing and isn't it supposed to change until it swallows some of its planets and then eventually collapses in itself in a few billion years? Is this change going to happen ... "over night"? Anyway, I am not against reducing CO2 emission, keeping the environment as clean as possible and protecting live on earth. I am against POLITICS getting involved!!! Money and Power aren't helping anyone besides those which abuse Climate Change as an ideology (religion) to get them for themselves and keep YOU under control!

Solar radiation comes into the greenhouse (or your car). It doesn't heat up anything. When the radiation hits plants and dirt and other things, the radiation is absorbed and re-radiated at a different frequency, which is not able to penetrate out the greenhouse window and shifts the light frequency into the infrared (heat). Solar radiation (the collection of all the light (frequencies)) can pass through CO2 because CO2 does not absorb most of the frequencies of solar radiation. CO2 does absorb the re-radiated frequencies reflected from the earth. Light frequencies are the key issue. Clothes, doors, windows work. Clothes keep us from looking naked because light frequencies are absorbed. But we're naked to radio frequencies because we receive calls on our cell phones if they're in our pockets, or if we're behind a door.

G.	@Lawrence Winkler do you really believe humanity can bring the level of CO2 in the atmosphere to that from 3+ billions years ago? 3 billion years, would that be before the sun dies? Besides, I am not sure you understood the point I wanted to make with water vapour. Clouds are protecting the surface from solar radiation by partly "catching" and partly reflecting it, right? And so does CO2. Radiation which otherwise would hit the ground hits greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.  How do you know that by lowering CO2 and the other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the radiation which then would simply pass through the atmosphere, would hit the ground just to get reflected back into space? How do the climate models account for this?	UCt3jNIAGhbSv478wNKneeuA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt3jNIAGhbSv478wNKneeuA	1	Ugysnw8nqRyD0cR-x814AaABAg	CL. G.
Ugysnw8nqRyD0cR-x814AaABAg.91ZHbrpiyqW91dzBeENKYz		1	2019-11-22 19:22:19	Lawrence Winkler	Increasing CO2 is causing increasing CO2 and methane and water vapor. That is the positive feedback loop that is making things worse exponentially. Increasing CO2 is not unfavorable to life -- just aerobic life. Anaerobic bacteria will just love the new earth, which will be the same as the old earth some 3.5 billion years ago, when the atmosphere of the earth was heavily CO2. After a billion years of anaerobic bacteria metabolizing materials and putting oxygen into the atmosphere, aerobic bacteria evolved, such as cyanobacteria, to utilize oxygen and use sunshine and CO2 to produce sugars.  The problem with burning fossil fuels is that it is putting back into the atmosphere the CO2 which was sequestered by bacteria as far back as some billions of years ago, certainly 10's of millions of years ago. Even today, the mass of all bacteria on earth far exceeds the collective mass of other living organisms on earth. No, increasing CO2 won't kill all life on the planet, just mostly the multicellular, non-bacterial life.

You are wrong when you say &quot;nobody is physically affected by global mean temperature...&quot; Higher global temperatures means increasingly warmer atmosphere and warmer oceans, which will cause more melting of glaciers and ice sheets and cause ocean waters to expand. Both of these phenomena will lead to potentially devastating increases in sea levels, and cause significant physical harm to millions of people who live near the coasts, all over the world.

Ugx-Fg8QYffGtd-C-U54AaABAg	1	2	2019-11-20 00:04:32	Roberto Kersevan	Nice interview, Sabine. Tim Palmer is one of the most serious (i.e. not cultist) climatologists/modelers around. He&#39;s talented for explaining things in a concise and clear way, plus being a native English speaker it helps, as compared to some non-English modelers.<br />Unfortunately he said some things, important ones, which are not true, and easy to prove as such... it suffices to read some papers on Geoscientific Model Development and/or similar peer-reviewed journals, where the performance of models is discussed, assessed, validated.<br /><br /><br />At the beginning of the interview he&#39;s said that the models rely on sound physics, he made the example of quantum mechanical calculations for the absorption lines of CO2 (or something like that), but in fact this is NOT true. Most physical phenomena in the models are PARAMETRIZED, i.e. they take the shortcut because their direct physical simulation is not possible today. This is due to the huge amount of lacking computer power, like 10 orders of magnitude, which would be necessary in order to model correctly all effects. This is not my opinion, to be clear, just listen to the youtube TEDx talk of Gavin Schmidt, head of GISS/NASA, another modeler coming from the non-climate field (Schmidt is a mathematician, while Palmer is a theoretical physicist). In addition many feedback effects are badly understood and modeled. This is also very well documented: albedo, cloud formation, ice/water/vapour H2O transition, and more... no way to model it correctly, also because they have no idea yet on how to do it.<br />Another proof that Palmer was not saying the truth about the implementation of physical principles in the models is the fact that HE is the one who&#39;s advocating &quot;imprecise computing&quot; (google this term in quotes and you&#39;ll see) for solving the lack of computational speed of today&#39;s models. There&#39;s a video about that too, easy to find, an hour-long one.<br />As S. Manabe, the first modeler, said back then in the early 80s, &quot;models are good to study the climate, but are not adeguate to make predictions&quot;. What the IPCC community tries to to is exactly the latter, to make predictions. <br />That make this predictions fake science, sorry. :-(<br />Cheers.

They found out it was easier to adjust the measured data to match the models, and they do it so good, they defy laws of nature. They got glaciers to grow in hot temperatures and to melt in low temperatures. I am sure they soon got it about right, to align the temperature curves to the Kieling curve, which the models already aim at.<br />Soon your pseudo science and fraud will be obvious, and you will be infamous along side with Göring, Luchenco and the tinfoil hat people	UC2BapqHuwOrdjKfnlRYYQkw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2BapqHuwOrdjKfnlRYYQkw	0

But the message is clear. 1) climate models produce two types of information , global and regional. 2) Global predictions are indicators they basically give a relation between co2 emissions and global temperature over time. Of course, the predictions are not perfect, but they are adequate to show that if we carry on as we are. then life will be impossible in some regions and mass migration could occur, “From the current trickle to a torrent” 3) Regional predictions are of the form:- How likely are we to see such distruptive events as the flooding in Doncaster and hurricanes etc elsewhere in the world. Predictions of such events are too hard to make precisiely at present. For a number of reasons. 4) a) Random effects that just can’t be modelled. ( The butterfly effect) b) sub grid modelling by parameterisation. for example the size of a grid cell in the model is about 100km square, which is too small to model individual clouds, so percentage cloud cover ( a parameter) has to be estimated from the average temperature and humidity in the computational cell. This parameter is not a fundamental equation (like Newtons laws of motion) which are used to calculate say pressure. More research, and particularly much more money for computers would be needed to resolve this. c) other problems with inadequate grid size are to do with topography( eg mountain ranges cause particular effects, if the shape and steepness of the mountain is not resolved then such factors as snow cover will not be calculated correctly. Similarly in ocean currents which circulate both horizontally and vertically require a better modelled resolution. 5) despite the modelling difficulties, a clear pattern emerges of more severe weather events occurring more often. ie the science isn't finished in terms of making accurate forecasts for the year 2100, but it is beyond reasonable doubt that CO2 levels rising at current rates would cause widespread damage to many people particularly the third world. 6) tipping points. eg if a forest gets too dry it will die, adding water later will not bring it back to life. Thus it won't do to say oh well carry on as we are and in 50 years time we'll have effective technology to capture and store CO2 and thus reduce CO2 levels to a safe value. By then the damage will have been done. If the forests are turned to a dustbowl, or a sand desert like the Sarhara, then nothing can be done to restore the forest. ( not said: other tipping points are glaciers feeding major rivers, when the glaciers melts permanently, the river dries up, then all vegetation will die and the soil will erode. also melting permafrost will release methane (a Greenhouse gas) which will lead to further warming). The conclusion, Global warming is real and dangerous. The possible effects are severe, we cannot say accurately which effects will occur when or where, but the threat to human life and prosperity is clear.

Why have we not reached this tipping point in the past when CO2 and temperatures were 10x higher than today?

Two or three years in a row is not warming, it is mere statistical fluctuation. Hotter may mean +0.1 °C, it is not a proper measure. 4. The present raise in CO2 concentration is then not caused by the human activity, as claimed, but by the global warming. There is no evidence whether emissions of CO2 can cause it, that is, whether the greenhouse effect is real, or whether the equilibrium point can be shifted. You don't need to insult people if you disagree, that only shows you are not confident, so there is a suspicion you are not honest. The authority argument is not valid either, but childish.

For example: I know that many temperature recording stations many years ago were located on the outskirts of small towns but those small towns have grown into cities today, and because of local effects near those stations the temperature readings today will be higher than say 100 years ago. How does the data take that effect into account?	UC8ba_9GilAzsAtYZoMg1ggg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8ba_9GilAzsAtYZoMg1ggg	0

The last ~50 years uncertainty has been minuscule like +/- 0.05 degrees Global Mean Surface Temperature (GMST) uncertainty because there's been hundreds of millions, likely billions, of high-quality measurements available to average. For anybody interested and not just another worthless brain-dead standard level 0 (bottom-of-toilet level) coal/oil shill-fuckwit there's a pretty good talk on temperature measurement since 1850 AD covering corrections and reliability in some detail at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQnt73zJ-S4 ("Francis Zwiers: The Instrumental Temperature Record and What it Tells us About Climate Change" posted by " Simon Fraser University" (8 km up the hill from me).

I suspect they would agree on most things except the reliability of the models.<br /><br />This video started out very positively from an &#39;alarmist&#39; point of view but from 14 mins on the whole video was about the unreliability of the models from both a confidence point of view and a granularity viewpoint. The latter, i.e. the inability to model local effects such as mountains and smaller cloud formations, means that there cannot be any confidence on the probability of tipping points.<br /><br />I thought Sabine was excellent in teasing out the uncertainty in the accuracy of the models. Very interesting that the range of predictions at 2100 that is rammed down our throats is due to the different models rather than a portrayal of degrees of confidence in any particular model. <br /><br />If I have misrepresented the video I would be very happy to be corrected. This is the first video I have found where a pro AGW expert has agreed that the science is not settled. Very refreshing.

You mentioned CO2 and the ocean, yes sure the study shows how it gives up CO2. This study shows it's temperature increase that has caused the CO2 increase. The human element is about 5% of that and not noticeable, but the point is Temperature rise is what elevates CO2 NOT the other way around. https://www.researchgate.net/profile/J-E_Solheim/publication/257343053_The_phase_relation_between_atmospheric_carbon_dioxide_and_global_temperature/links/56e4581508ae68afa1106148/The-phase-relation-between-atmospheric-carbon-dioxide-and-global-temperature.pdf O.

The reality is the climate scientists did little research and forgot these other 3 important ones: The De-Vries, Gleissberg and Yoshimura. When these sinusoidal time periods HIGH points stack = exceptional warming, when the troughs coincide = the opposite. maunder The medieval warm period was not a local event either but this is long enough and plenty to read. There are experts with seriously more knowledge and intellect than the 'used car salesmen' that represent so called "Climate scientists" but that is changing. All the best.

When CO2 catastrophist scientists debated scientists (including LIndzen) in a well-moderated "intelligence squared debate", the polling, before and after, showed that support for the catastrophist predictions collapsed. You can probably find that debate on youtube. There another youtube video of Gavin Schmidt basically avoiding Dr. Roy Spencer (Climate Scientist Gavin Schmidt runs in fear from a debate ) Ralph Nader once tried to get a climate debate between a Democrat and Republican, and basically the Democrat could never fit it in his schedule. I did see (surprisingly) a "debate" between Judith Curry and Michael Mann, about 2 years ago. It wasn't well moderated, and so Curry and Mann mostly talked past each other. It was like a US political talk show, where people stick to talking points and practice evasion as standard MO. Maybe Sabine will interview Dr. Patrick Michaels, whose take on the models is about the opposite of Tim Palmer. See youtube video "Dr Patrick Michaels: Is Science Trustworthy?" Is she "courageous" enough to do that?	UCpfFpXxZbN7C0TiefokiitQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpfFpXxZbN7C0TiefokiitQ	1	UgwilDTp-KiJFdYr0AB4AaABAg	Dave W

I read into you running away to debunk something based on some blog or opinion or self created "We claim this site to be propaganda" when they are actually describing themselves. The only way we all get answers is by discussions, it seems climate alarmists inflate their own positions and ignore conflicting data. There is not a single paper proving how Co2 has caused climate change now and in the past, but proving we can calculate what a doubling of Co2 will bring. I discuss on Quora too where diagrams can be presented and discussed. The usual fall back to my facts is some claim I am paid oil or very weak arguments emotionally based and not scientific in nature. I do this for free because I want science away from ideologies and religion as is seems to have contorted to these last decades.

All you will do is probably cite say sceptical science which is not an unbiased point of reference. I ask that you read the content not cite some political bias to a website. Cite the papers critical off the science. I fact check the fact checkers and have found THEM to be wrong. By all means I already checked and there are 2 very lame attempts critical of Humus's paper that actually now claim some other trigger point that is undefined since that would back them into a corner of some forcing pre-industrial and therefore not manmade..The desperation to keep the lie going is endless. That tends to happen when non-scientific people do not question a hypothesis. Science get's better with critical thinking. All states of matter do not behave in the same way and the problem applying SB is that climate scientists lost saturation after they contrived "layers" in a gas. They know it exists yet it's gone. If CO2 was forcing it would have done so at the times when it was as high as today or higher. It did not. The molar mass vision of the ideal gas law applies not the SB constant. There is one professor I found that does not like Homes' paper claiming a circular reference, but this does not seem to hold weight since the calculations are backed by measurements (2 Venus landers) Climate change is real but cherry picking the data such as the IPCC did is getting TSI at a level 20times lower than it should be. They also missed off these climate cycles you can read about them in this paper. Lüdecke, H.-J., Hempelmann, A., & Weiss, C. (2013). Multi-periodic climate dynamics: spectral analysis of long-term instrumental and proxy temperature records. Climate of the Past, 9(1), 447-452. https://www.clim-past.net/9/447/2013/cp-9-447-2013.pdf The data confirms the Antarctic proxy valid for temperature even the extraction and measurement method with pressure induced errors make the ice core data unreliable for Co2. This paper also confirms the medieval warm period was NOT a local event since 6 European cities agree with the Antarctic data set. Skeptical science tried to "Debunk" the graph I presented showing these past climate cycles and they failed. Another here confirms the periods were not "Local" Loehle, C. (2007). A 2000-year global temperature reconstruction based on non-treering proxies. Energy & Environment, 18(7), 1049-1058. http://faculty.fgcu.edu/twimberley/EnviroPol/EnviroPhilo/GlobalTempResc.pdf "In the present study, only three or four of the sites are from Europe, so it cannot be argued that the MWP was strictly a European phenomenon. Other studies also show the MWP (Little Climatic Optimum) in Europe (Lamb, 1965; Martinez-Cortizas et al., 1999; Shindell et al., 2001), Greenland (Dahl-Jensen et al., 1998), Africa (deMenocal et al., 2000; Holmgren et al., 2001), North America (Campbell et al., 1998; Li et al., 2000; Petersen, 1994; Shabalova and Weber, 1999), South America (Iriondo et al., 1993; Villabala, 1994), and Asia (Hong et al., 2000; Liu et al., 1998)." Why are you keen to palm science off to a parking house and not discuss it here? Interesting. Co2 is not a heat trapping gas, all matter gives of it's energy. While taking say water vapour and clouds as an example the heat is not trapped, it's effect is local and slows a great deal of energy release, The pressure differential being key to high-warm low-cold. For co2 to be a problem all 3 of these must have to be true. 1. Temperature must follow CO2, that CO2 drives global temperatures. 2. The ice core record must reflect what is in the atmosphere at that time 3. Most or all of the recent CO2 must have been caused by us . Not a single point is true. Co2 was already 325PPM average <1939! since after the maunder minimum we have the modern warm period. I am open to being proven wrong are you? for example the testing of ~2000 mini suns during the cold war apparently gets no mention in any discussions about temperature and man's impact. That is laughable politicised group think based on pareidolia and apophenia. Co2 can only be framed by ignoring a lot of science and data to frame it. It's fraud or incompetency (or both) the BBC refuse to discuss with experts holding science to themselves. Key players for example at GISS refuse to debate or interview experts. Settled science? not even close.	UC_Wc0Fg54cK4LbeHQ0-4fXw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_Wc0Fg54cK4LbeHQ0-4fXw	1	UgwilDTp-KiJFdYr0AB4AaABAg	Dave W

What I mean is science for Co2 claiming climate change is actually based on several mistakes with spectrographic analysis. By parroting I was talking about false claims the number 1 being that elevated CO2 is the cause for temperature change. There are 2 papers, one shows a possible link another suggests a forcing. Neither provide evidence of that great assumption. There is a relationship but no causation. This is seen in the Vostok data, though the data is so course 800 year lag is suggested. More recently by Ole Humlum. Co2 follows temperature rise, it does not cause it. https://www.researchgate.net/profile/J-E_Solheim/publication/257343053_The_phase_relation_between_atmospheric_carbon_dioxide_and_global_temperature/links/56e4581508ae68afa1106148/The-phase-relation-between-atmospheric-carbon-dioxide-and-global-temperature.pdf Another is GHG (greenhouse gas theory) "Discussion on Maxwell vs Arrhenius and the ‘Greenhouse Effect’ ""Work in this area of gas physics was detailed in the 19th century. However, there is a strong difference between the work and the views of the researchers Maxwell and Arrhenius. Maxwell’s work [15] shows that temperatures in the lower troposphere of Earth are primarily determined by convection and the atmospheric mass/pressure/gravity relationship. Arrhenius’s later work [18] completely ignored this and determined that temperatures in the lower troposphere of Earth are caused by the radiative effects of greenhouse gases. There have been papers critical of Arrhenius’s radiative effects ideas since 1909 [19]."" A third is that of spectrographic analysis. Just because a certain band is seen to react to IR, It's a false assumption this blocks heat. To use an analogy dropping a pebble into a river will not stop it flowing, the pebble is wet. Dropping 1000's may displace the water enough that the width changes. Also the wavenumber that CO2 has an effect is nowhere near that where the earths atmosphere gives up heat. The science was dodgy since radiative transfer starts of using the Stefan Boltzmann constant (mean for solids) applied to a gas. My claims are not false they are based on a detailed study of this topic and the scientific fraud it has become. By adding mass to the atmosphere a temperature increase can be calculated. GHG theory is wrong, we do not live in a system that constricts convention as in a greenhouse so that label is already a poorly chosen one. It's a climb down to reality yet he does contradict himself at one point, it's probably just a slip of words. You can read about GHG in this paper that accurately predicts the temperature on several planets with an atmosphere: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324599511_Thermal_Enhancement_on_Planetary_Bodies_and_the_Relevance_of_the_Molar_Mass_Version_of_the_Ideal_Gas_Law_to_the_Null_Hypothesis_of_Climate_Change.

Site the paper showing a 7 Degree difference please and Co2 levels. You parrot false claims. Ice core data has a monotonic data set and that's why it's used for Hockey stick alarm. Other proxies clearly show over 400PPM during human times. Pretty much all of the past had higher CO2 levels than today. It wasn't imported from space. There is no evidence or supportive evidence that stands up to scientific scrutiny that Co2 is some control thermostat on our temperature. It IS the sun, Cosmic ray flux and known climate cycles. The IPCC report shows 0.05WM2 because they cherry picked the data, it's 26times that when looking at when the warming ACTUALLY started (which of course is pre industrial) CO2 follows temperature, it does not drive it.

CO2 is an insulator that traps heat in the atmosphere. The more CO2, the more heat gets trapped, and the more the Earth warms. That was true then and it still is now.

It treats climate change like one single deadly event, rather than an ongoing process that will cause more destruction the longer it's left unaddressed. The point is that we can see an obvious warming trend in climate data, we’re already seeing ecosystems collapse and biodiversity suffer and extreme weather displace entire towns. The longer emissions continue unchecked, the worse it’s going to get and the more people will suffer, and that alone is enough to take action.

We can see the very broad strokes of how billions of tonnes of CO2 pumped into the atmosphere a year will cause disruptions in the Earth's climate systems, vital ecosystems, agriculture, etc. Modeling the finer details will be important for predicting extreme weather, among other things, but we have enough information to act on.

Furthermore, its emissions are growing, whereas those of the highly industrialized countries, like the US, are falling. In practical terms, it means getting the Chinese to stop and reverse their emissions. The most likely Chinese response would be (and actually is) to give a big, fat finger. And there&#39;s nothing the world can do, even with Greta&#39;s help, about the Chinese finger, so here we are.	UCsqumdoz9OXQqfyWAUjif2Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsqumdoz9OXQqfyWAUjif2Q	0

Extreme weather events, to use the terminology were frequent in the past as well, when CO2 in the atmosphere was somewhat lower.

The second mission is a thousand times more difficult yet it is now demanded (by political ideology?) that science be as certain and precise in the second mission as in the first, so as to be useful in advising policies of governments, and without delay. I think (climate) science and scientists are in to a very difficult time. Everybody should carefully watch your movie about bias, Sabine.

Yes, co2 generally lags INITIALLY shifts in temp (eg milankovich cycles shift the amount of solar/ energy into the system) but then due to feedback effects co2 spikes and pushes temperature changes.

He can not see the forest for the trees and his vision is limited by his own prejudices. Has he considered that 99.99% comes from the sun? Radiative forcing is the area we could simply change by shielding the earth at some point closer to the sun with a solar sail to shade the earth. We could also use multiple satellites to redirect sunlight to the earth to warm it. There are dozens of possibilities if you are willing to allow them into your imagination, none of which will happen if we are constantly in the mind set that the sky is falling and there is no hope. That sort of fear mongering is how you cow a population and rob it of its will to be free and innovative. We live in a world where life expectancy has doubled in 150 years, Poverty is dropping and we have the opportunities past generations have died to secure for us. Yet we give this dreaming up for this leftist defeatest dogma? I refuse to believe we must work harder to make do with less. I believe in humanity and their ability to survive and evolve. Define the problem and we will deal with it. Don’t give me global cooling then warming then green house effect then extreme climate then climate change and now Climate emergency. Pick one things and we will fix it if we find it’s a real problem. Defeatism has never solved any problems nor will it now.

Then with all that uncertainty he claim a whole bunch of things he is certain about. As to the veracity of the chart which is a bunch of models that can’t get anything right averaged to somehow make the average more accurate than the sum of all their inaccuracies... wow is that what passes for science these days? He freely admits that so much is unsettled and no model can even remotely approximate the real world by itself without the help of other data or massaging the raw information until it fits the facts you want. So upon this unstable mess he would like us to build world policy, when already we are spending more than one US billion per day solving problems that haven’t happened (except in these model that are based on first principles and zero real world factors)...at the detriment of real world problems we have right now. We are destabilising our power systems with unreliable “renewable “ energy, we are wasting money that could be used to further solve poverty and housing. We are not spending nearly enough on chemical plastic recycling or medical research. We are weaponising and terrifying our children. This approach is unacceptable.

The Russian model is the outlier of modeling and the closest to correct. The Russian model has been predicting no significant warming and we have had "the pause" during this time. You cannot even prove warming. But let's say the planet is warming for the sake of argument. Is it because of carbon dioxide? Probably not, rising carbon dioxide has been a trailing indicator with no runaway effect. But for the sake of argument let say it is. Can humans stop and reverse the rise in carbon dioxide without equal disruption of economic growth and prosperity from rising sea levels? Maybe. It would probably be better just have everyone just move. But for the sake of argument, let's say it we can stop global warming by lowering co2. The western world has been lowering co2 emissions through technology and efficiency over the last 50years. Cars alone are 2 to 3 times more efficient. The main growth in co2 emissions are from the developing world, China, India, Africa,... should they stop developing. What is the cost in human life to stop 3rd world development?? Climate change alarmists claim they are following the science, you are not. you are following the heard lead by the politicians. If you get your science and weather from your politicians you have a really big problem. So why do politicians want global warming?? Problem, solution, reaction. This is a method that leads the masses to a solution that was predetermined by a fabricated problem, global warming. The solution is a world bank run by the UN that uses carbon credits as currency. BTW: There is such a thing as carbon credits managed by the World Bank out of the UN. It has made Al Gore a billionaire and Gates, Clintons', and many more politicians very wealthy.

What the Times indicates as signs of accelerated climate change are normal variations of whether. Over the last three years, the Greenland ice sheet has gained several million tons of ice mass. The fact that the mass in August is less than in February is not climate change. The year over year change is well within the norm.<br />The Times mentions the heat wave in Europe. There have been much worst heat waves, many in the period before carbon dioxcide was elevated. Normal variations in weather are not climate change.

You can see that temperatures fluctuated during the 40s and 50s, but generally rose during the 60s and 70s. The data is there, it's very variable, but the obvious trend is up. Saying that there's a rise over the last 70 years doesn't mean it rose every year, or necessarily even every decade. Has it risen every decade since the 1940s? Actually, it has: https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/figures/global-annual-average-temperature-deviations-1850-2007-relative-to-the-1850-1899-average-in-oc-the-lines-refer-to-10-year-moving-average-the-bars-to-the-annual-land-and-ocean-global-average-3 It's not shown on those graphs, but the 2010s so far has been unambiguously higher than the 2000s.

When you find a bias in old data, and a straightforward and reliable way to estimate the affect of that bias, you correct the data. It would be wrong not to, especially if you need comparisons between old and new data. Besides, the effect of this revision on average global temps was to revise the historic data *upwards,* which *reduces* the amount of global warming since that time. That would be a daft thing to do if NASA were in on a conspiracy to exaggerate the warming. If you're interested, there are plenty of detailed explanations you can find on actual science sites, rather than dedicated science denial conspiracy sites.

Well, go back 70 years and you are in the 1950s and in the 1950s temperatures were warmer but CO2 was less. More Tax = more money for research "Grants" and more jobs for "Scientists".

Yet Dr.palmer says climate scientists need more money to predict future extreme weather events that....may, or may not ....have a impact in the future. This man was tip toeing around the argument and seem clearly conflicted so as not to piss off the alarmists, while simultaneously trying not to appear foolish to the scientific community due to the politicized nature of global warming. In case it is not clear where I stand on this topic, I will spell it out for you. I think made-man Warming, due to CO2, is BS and a non-problem hijacked by the left to impose their political will, increase taxes, and make energy prohibitively expensive to the poor and middle class.

Why do you not say with your own words why and where i am wrong? Unlike Ally i mention all periods, so if you want you can pick one or fight them all. Here i have a link too, it is a graph and you can say "i do not trust this data". Well we have Isotopes and proxys, so give me a better graph. It makes you wonder why these graphs are only brought up by skeptics, wouldnt it suggest itself that we would have countless of these visualisations of CO2 and temperature? Instead no one barely talks about it and Ally does a poor job here. https://images.app.goo.gl/2vgfna25Meyi7Q4G8 This graph is not the end of all wisdom, in fact i can actualize it myself with a study of Scwarck et,al 20019. Where it is stated that 6000ppm CO2 was absorbed by the cold ocean in the ordovician, so i can even help you to lower CO2 but it will not help you, because the question remains: How is a full ice age possible with 6000ppm in the first place and the faint sun paradox wont help, because it was hot before and after the glaciation anyways, hence the term paradox. You have to realize that between the normal hot house equilibrium and the exceptional ice age equilibrium, there is "only" 10°C difference, so the forcings even of "just" 1,5°C per doubling, simply does not work anywhere in history. And this is despite the general correlation of CO2 and ocean temperature due to solubility. With an Orckham view we need only one thing on a geological time scale to explain temperature changes: Continental Drift, if there is landmasses at the pole, there is an ice age. CO2 is nowhere needed to explain temperature and nowhere it shows its supposed forcing.

During that period carbon dioxide levels have risen only in the past one hundred years significantly. How much of that temperature increase is due to Carbon Dioxide is largely unknown as the true sensitivity to carbon dioxide is thought to be less than previously hypothesized due to how inaccurate the models have been using the theorized sensitivity value. Satellite data was used to actually measure the Infrared Radiation Budget or how much was absorbed and how much was lost to Space. The actual data suggests that not nearly enough Infrared Radiation was being absorbed for Carbon Dioxide playing any real part in the current warming instead due to increased plant growth it might actually be responsible for the pause or halt in warming. Climate could have never developed into the semi stable system we have that allowed life to flourish in the first place.

The total Power output of all of these Hurricanes, Typhoons and Cyclones is and has been recorded for over 100 years. The total power output of these storms and frequency has decreased not increased. Droughts, Wildfires, Flooding etc also have not increased. The number of Climate Scientists who believe Catastrophic Warming or Climate Change is happening is not 100% Professor Lindzen of M.I.T. one of the original Climatologists along with his colleagues and others like Judith Curry all agree the earth is warming and that Carbon Dioxide plays a part but they do not agree that the warming will pose any danger. That is the position of most Climatologists as they can see planetary warming due to a number of factors. What is dangerous is understanding how close we were to not having enough carbon dioxide to support life. Anything less than 120 PPM Carbon Dioxide and photo synthesis can no longer occur and that means everything dies. You will know Catastrophic Global Warming is real when the proponents start acting like it and money is being spent on adaptation and survival instead of luxury conferences.

We suffer storms all the time, horrible heat and heavy rains, I am in a temperate zone, but nothing absolutely nothing that didn&#39;t happen before. <br /><br />Things grow so fiercely in my garden that I cannot keep it in check. Nothing is dying except from man&#39;s invasion of animal and plant territory but you leave nature unchecked and it&#39;s thriving.<br /><br />You mentioned devastating climactic events. Is it just that now we can see what is happening whereas before we didn&#39;t? I mean we couldn&#39;t observe in real time what was happening around the world whereas now we can. Many of the records show that less people die from severe weather than in the past and that severe climate has always happened, in modern records, and further back, little has changed.<br /><br />Or if it has, show me.

UgzuU7KL_0j5ERW21N54AaABAg	7	2	2019-11-17 23:57:01	Paul Hunt	An interview that revealed that the &quot;science&quot; is based on assumptions, approximations, the setting of parameters etc; it cannot be made to to apply to any particular regions only on a global scale. As Sabine&#39;s questions revealed, the whole science is a series of differing forecasts that have been homogenised to produce an overall result. Where are the comparisons of the predictions to reality? Good science always compares reality to the forecast(s) and identify the reasons for any differences. Professor Palmer did not mention reality, except in a very generalised way, when not only did he repeat the usual mantra about the need for change etc, but he then sought to blame climate change to the migration issues faced by Europe and the USA.. On what grounds? What scientific proof is there of the connection of climate change to migration? Sabine, by asking a few key questions and then staying silent, has revealed the lack of fact- based rigour and analysis at the heart of this science.

If you think you are always right because you have a tenure, I can swear I have seen people with tenure that were clinical morons. In the 60's, everyone who were hanging out in an university because they had big dads or money have been converted into researchers, including engineers. You are disgustingly arrogant, you think you are better than everybody, but no evidence to exhibit for that, and especially not in your comment dripping of conceit and despise. It is an open secret now how peer review works. The authors are judged by the mass of mediocre researchers, and if they express something that is not adopted by the mop, their career is at risk. Science, all disciplines, is stalled for 50 years because of this crazy system, only technology evolves and conceals the flop. Research have been corrupted by the big corporations, and vast propaganda operations have been setup to mute the "dissident," especially with phases like "conspiration theory." The money is concentrated in few hands, they don't even need to conspire. The truth is, today we can no longer trust the scientists in hot subjects like drugs, pesticides, GMO, and precisely climatology. Anyway, even top researchers overnight align to the official science, we can trust weathercocks.

The flat earth thing mystifies me to be honest. Not sure how anyone can say they think the earth is flat with a straight face. I also don’t understand why arguably intelligent people are swallowing this whole climate change nonsense. Nobody but nobody can truly say they understand enough about all the factors which influence the Earth’s climate to know with any certainty what it should be doing. Nobody can say they can accurately measure the global mean temperature. The best they can do is little more than a guess. Nobody can say what it should be either. Science does not know what the optimum CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is nor can anyone say what it would be if all fossil fuel consumption ceased immediately. Science is nowhere close to understanding how it all works yet here we are. People are genuinely deceived into thinking that somehow there is a climate knob that we humans are capable of turning. There isn’t. We don’t know the first thing about what to expect from the climate if we take drastic action. To put this in context, all the models so far have predicted what will happen if we don’t. Every single one of them without exception has been dead wrong. It’s not that they’re a bit wrong or one or two were wrong. Every single one. They said the arctic ice would all be gone years ago. It isn’t. They said the Maldives would be under water by now. They aren’t. They said polar bears would be extinct by now. They’re not. They talk about a rise in global temperature of was it 2 degrees Celsius like it’s a tipping point that will somehow cause catastrophic problems ranging from the sublime to the ridiculous. I mean, give me a break. At some point you have to face up to the fact that reality just isn’t lining up with the narrative. Ocean acidification is complete nonsense. I could go on and on. I’m sorry, but all the peer reviewed scientific literature in the world isn’t worth a thing if reality doesn’t back it up. I’ve read all the pages in the links you sent and I thank you for taking the time to respond. I found nothing convincing in them and I remain firmly convinced that the whole anthropogenic climate change story is nothing more than a gigantic global scam with an ulterior motive. My rationale goes something along the lines of “How come every proposed solution to climate change involves socialism?

You say "It's real and serious and requires action for lots of reasons, EVEN WITHOUT MODELS (My emphasis)" The first link you gave gives 9 lines of "evidence". The first point is "Simple chemistry" - when we burn carbon based material C02 is emitted - no dispute there. The second point is "Basic accounting" - what we burn and therefore how much C02 we emit. This analysis uses computer modelling. Third pont is "Measuring C02" - in the atmosphere and trapped in ice. We have one station atop Mauna Kea that supposedly represents the whole atmosphere and the ice records, which show clearly that C02 levels have been much much higher in the past - as much as 1700ppm during the Cambrian period when life flourished - this analysis uses computer models extensively. Fourth point is "Chemical analysis of the atmospheric C02" that reveals the increase is coming from burning fossil fuels. This also uses extensive computer models and is a topic of much dispute. Fifth point is "Basic Physics" that shows us that C02 absorbs heat. Absolutely no dispute but this really isn't a good illustration to use for multiple reasons. Sixth point is "Monitoring climate conditions" to find that recent warming of the Earth is correlated to and follows rising C02 emissions. There is much research and much data pointing to the fact that C02 in fact lags temperature rather than leads it. Someone's got the cart before the horse or the bull by the horns - not sure which. Oh, and about that monitoring climate thing - as Prof. Palmer so succinctly explained, we really are kidding ourselves if we think we have enough data to do that and then even we did have enough data, we don't have sufficient computing resources to process it. What we do have is computer modelling. Seventh point is "Ruling out natural factors" that can influence climate like the Sun and ocean cycles. "Rule out" the sun and the oceans? computer models and their complete inadequacy are at the root of this. Eighth point is - Employing computer models - Ninth point is "Consensus among scientists." This is actually irrelevant. It's also blatantly untrue, that 97% thing has been roundly and soundly demolished but even if it wasn't - it's still irrelevant. Consensus is valid in law - it has no place in science. I'll have a look through those other links shortly as well.

Here's a good list of some of them: http://blogs.edf.org/climate411/2017/03/23/how-do-we-know-that-humans-are-causing-climate-change-these-nine-lines-of-evidence/ And every science organisation on the planet has spoken out now and said yes, it's serious, and yes, it requires action. You can scroll through read all their individual statements here: https://www.gleick.com/blog/statements-on-climate-change-from-major-scientific-academies-societies-and It's not reliant on models. I think the models are good evidence, but if you don't, that's up to you. Here's something that might interest you. In 2010 a group of skeptics got together – not just random skeptics but seriously scientifically competent skeptics – with millions of dollars of fossil fuel funding, to redo the climate data for themselves. They wanted to prove all the other groups wrong. If they had done, that would have been an absolutely massive deal. The guy who led the project was a serious climate skeptic – there are plenty of videos of him pre-2010 trashing climate scientists. Here he is talking about what happened: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTk8Dhr15Kw	UC-Xz0kbedHc6JV9BkSRpbrg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-Xz0kbedHc6JV9BkSRpbrg	1	UgxMw8J2EdqyPn4q94Z4AaABAg	pete jones

I guess if you believe what the models predict then sure, but if you have trouble accepting that premise because you’ve been paying attention and discovering that without exception the models have failed, then it seems fair to remain unconvinced. I appreciate that most - I wouldn’t say every - major scientific organisation is on the same page. It’s to be expected when they’re all singing from the same song sheet. And why wouldn’t they? Money talks. I notice he uses the terms ‘CO2 forcing’ and ‘tipping points’ but he didn’t speak about them with any sort of conviction, almost like he doesn’t think they’re real but he stops short of coming out and saying it. It’s almost like he’s obliged to parrot the whole narrative whether he believes it or not. This is where there’s a problem. The science is anything but settled. There are many scientists who don’t believe there is a climate emergency or that any drastic action is needed. This is where there is no science, just belief. It’s only certified nutcases like Al Gore who are pushing this climate alarmism. It’s patently obvious reasonable scientists don’t go along with it but where is their voice of opposition? They remain silent. Not because they agree with it but because they’ve seen what happens when they speak a word against it. Another point if I may, don’t make the mistake of thinking that every major science organisation on the planet has done their own work. They haven’t. Most of it comes from a small handful of people at a very small number of organisations. To this day the IPCC computer models remain unavailable for scrutiny or testing because they are ‘proprietary’ models. So we find that the whole anthropogenic climate change story rests upon computer models that nobody is allowed to see. We just have to believe that what they tell us is true because “scientists say”. Do you see why people with the ability to think for themselves might consider that climate change has more in common with a religion that it does with science? Yes, science does know it’s limits. It needs to stop pretending it knows more than it does.	UC_4Qms9VmsXgUn64wITd0fA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_4Qms9VmsXgUn64wITd0fA	1	UgxMw8J2EdqyPn4q94Z4AaABAg	pete jones

We bloody well do know enough to know that climate change is real, profoundly serious and requires urgent action. Every major scientific organisation on the planet has said this. If he didn't say that, it would be very odd – given all the lines of evidence that *don't* involve computer models, in addition to what is clear from models. But there are limits to what we can say from computer models about what will unfold at individual places and individual events. He's giving it to you exactly as it is.

But it is certainly your prerogative to present yourself to the world that way if you wish. But since you like to read, here are a few more publications for your consideration. The climate debate is shifting and some of the evidence of that follows: https://solarisheppa.geomar.de/cmip6 https://www.princeton.edu/news/2018/0... https://e360.yale.edu/features/how-a-... https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.04843.pdf https://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/briefs/rossow_01/computer.html Best wishes.

It is factual, and reports observations that are real, and that contradict statements written in The New York Times, *which is not a scientific source* Indeed, it hasn't been a "heat wave", but three short temperature peaks with abnormally cold periods in between. I witnessed it myself. And there have also been a cold wave on the East Coast of America, is it global warming? Both continents are very different because of the Gulf Stream, the anticyclone on the Acores isles, and because of the Sahara that is very hot. Heat peaks are not exceptional at all in Western Europe, even if they don't reach temperatures above 40°C, air masses coming from the Sahara are common. So The New YT can sing any song to the american people.	UCFFgGCT5wFP3-b_P4A-l58A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFFgGCT5wFP3-b_P4A-l58A	1	UgxYQ-psjpcVObyBKoJ4AaABAg	Tom Burns

The planet is greener now than during the industrial revolution. Arctic sea ice is fluctuating at normal intervals. Agricultural yields are better than ever. Those are facts that you can look up. Even the most sceptical person should first and foremost invest some time into research before falling for a political scam and mass hysteria. Heat waves and some weather extremes have and will always occur. As of now the planet is doing just fine. Don&#39;t believe me ?

Guess what, I managed to blow some more co2 into the air, just for good measure and of course to keep the plants happy. Anyway, you keep asking me for scientific evidence, however somehow I can't get rid of the feeling that if I present data you will say it isn't relevant or ridicule the source, right ? Guess the same way I claim that the IPCC reports have been 'tuned' to fit the agenda..... And I am pretty sure you will also have explanations at hand that will explain why life on earth has survived co2 levels in excess of 7000ppm and why we suddenly are reaching a 'tipping point' just now around 440ppm, right ? Fact is that no matter how much you try to be a climate alarmist, the whole Asian economy is laughing at the Western economy strangulating themselves with some sort of mass hysteria. Do you hold stocks in some Chinese company? That would explain a lot to me..........

Even the most hardcore climate change supporters have to admit that current climate models have undeniable flaws.

The unadjusted rural thermometer temperature record still shows slight cooling since 1900. That doesn&#39;t fit the CO2 narrative but with the help of the three government stooges, Mann, Schmidt, and Hansen, the necessary warming can be manafactured.<br /><a href="https://youtu.be/vzGPq9LSjEw">https://youtu.be/vzGPq9LSjEw</a>	UCYMQs4o7pQ830ThusytaUmw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYMQs4o7pQ830ThusytaUmw	0

There are too many independent teams working on exactly the same question. Finding an error in standard knowledge is gold in science. And I don't see that the governments are really interested in tackling climate change. Quite the contrary. It makes no sense that they manipulate science in that direction. And then they don't even pay scientists to work on the IPCC? To me this is no explanation. No evidence. Not logical. Improbable. ... And by using words like "left", "hijacked", "socialist agenda" I don't see you coming and arguing from a scientific view point. I know it is easier to manipulate in a field like "health field" (especially trophology for additional reasons) where data is the problem. And naturally it should be heavily influenced by companies. But even there the main error has to do with statistics (wrongly used, p-hacked, significance niveau too low,...). And due to systematic errors (repetition studies are not validated) there is a reproduction crisis. And more importantly you see evidence of this in statistics of the papers. But this is all not the case for climate scientists. The only thing you perhaps need to analyse the data is to have excess to super computers. Every scientists can use time on one in my country. ps: I have read many articles including from climate science. It is my way to inform myself.

Okay, my comment was directed towards Danny, however I will address your comment too. I have a doctorate degree in the health field and I have reviewed hundreds of articles in scientific journals and I have first hand knowledge regarding research and it’s funding. There is widespread corruption in the scientific method. It has been corrupted by funding. Money is only available for the topic that the funder ( usually the federal government) wants researched, and if you want the gravy train to continue, your conclusions had better match the “expected” outcome. So if you truly have any idea how research works your comments are disingenuous. As far as you tube is concerned, there is a wealth of legitimate information available thru recorded lectures and interviews. So I call BS on your assertion that you tube is for ”entertainment only.” I am not a climate scientist, but I can smell the stink of this politicized topic, and the fact that you rely on scientific articles that you probably never looked at to support this non-problem speaks volumes. Man-made global warming has been hijacked by the left to further their socialist agenda for tax revenue and unwittingly increasing the cost of energy for the poor and the middle class. It is immoral.

But your sentences lack semantic and syntax to make them readable. For example "CO2 is the axis". What axis? CO2 is no axis. Do you mean that CO2 should be data on one axis of a graph? Which graph? It doesn't make sense! "caused the turn around" What turn around? (turn around at the end of the ice age, or the cooling, the turn around of the warming - both could be judging from your sentence before) From syntax the axis is what is turning things around. This makes the axis even more mysterious. Now it must be a physical thing. Not an axis of a graph. "If ..., _then ..._ ?" Your sentence is missing the main part. What if? What is the question?

The climate warming/cooling is much more to do with sun cycles than anything else, ive read a paper due to be released next year by 2 Irish guys... completely dissproves c02 causing climate change, we all will see the evidence soon, which is why the government's are pushing so hard now to get the tax MONEY for a false mission... spend 100 bil on reducing c02? Or 100 bil on flood defences ,agricultural reapropriation, pollution control?🤔 doenst matter what field I'm in, your local farmers field for all it matters... a simple extensive look into global temperatures and correlating c02 lvls will show you that the climate ... 1.. has nothing to do with c02.... 2... we are getting colder 😘	UCy9y9bNLJ_2gJo7sLtGndqA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy9y9bNLJ_2gJo7sLtGndqA	1	UgyCAT2SpYRsgKc7hq54AaABAg	Michael Krusche

I don’t think humans can control or change anything at this point. If we cut emissions we will warm due to aerosols falling out of the sky. What field of science are you in if you don’t mind me asking? And C02 levels that are too low is a different problem. But without water vapor the surface of the earth would be some 30c degrees cooler. And water vapor is limited by the Clausius-Clapeyron relation and therefore cannot change significantly unless the temperature does. And CO2 is responsible for relatively few degrees of change, but unlike water vapor, it can change by accumulating over long periods of time....decades or longer.

C02 is plant food and if we had double the amount we have now, tje climate would do what it was doing anyway... it gets warm it gets cold.... its happened continuously since time began, only humans are arrogant enough to believe they can control what is goin on	UCy9y9bNLJ_2gJo7sLtGndqA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy9y9bNLJ_2gJo7sLtGndqA	1	UgyCAT2SpYRsgKc7hq54AaABAg	Michael Krusche

However, it took nearly 250 years to warm just 1 degree above baseline from CO2 alone. Methane, is a hydrocarbon has 26x’s the warming potential per unit than CO2, but doesn’t stay in the atmosphere as long as CO2 and there is less of it in the atmosphere. Water Vapor will cause the most warming and could accelerate the CO2 levels and cause more warming in a short time than by CO2 alone. There are other non-condensable gases that have some GWP, like oxides of nitrogen, ozone, BC, BrC, or aerosols , cloud feedback and sulfuric acid needs to be considered.

You guess, because it is mathematically impossible. Palmer is trying to model a chaotic system, he doesn&#39;t know how many variables to use and his models are simply his opinion because there is no science involved - just a load of guesswork. How much money is the government paying him for this garbage? You should ask him about Le Chatilier&#39;s principle and why he is using positive feedback. He does that to give himself the answers he wants to find. Positive feedback would have cooked the Earth billions of years ago.

Q1: Which observables are in chaotic systems easier and more robustly predictable through ensemble methods than in non-chaotic non-convergent systems? What does "easier" and "robustly predictable" mean in this context? Q2: The absolute majority of experts believed for a long time that the Navier-Stokes equations let's say on the whole 3d-space without obstacles have global classical solutions for initial conditions in Schwartz space. Why did they believe that and what paper/result changed their minds?	UCxY_EHgyeTc4fIpE2qVM2jQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxY_EHgyeTc4fIpE2qVM2jQ	1	UgzZEpYP40HHoc3Itkx4AaABAg	Spiro Gyra

Anthropogenic CO2 is less than 4% of the 0.04% of the CO2 in the atmosphere and this is supposed to control all of the world&#39;s climate zones? There is no empirical evidence for this and if Palmer has evidence he should tell us. He does not because it doesn&#39;t exist. He is peddling propaganda.

If the presented models of Rahmsdorf in this article meet observations than fine. Then they are below the average as well. However, I couldn't look into this Foster-paper, where the temps are from. What Rahmsdorf obviosly did, was mixing all types of temperature data together. But the sat data are considerably lower than the others. So even here the sat. data alone would be at the lower end. Just project 0.14K... And also assume that only part of the warning would be from CO2. As I picked up from a Video somewhere the currently most exact models are the Russian models. I wonder what they made differently. And If you really hear to what this guy here in the Video said about how the have to adjust the models for all kinds of real problems I really doubt a lot of their outputs because of what they put in. Also check the undocumented historical temperature adjustments by NOAA and friends always in a specific direction. I don't even to talk about the data tricking by the Mann-climate gang. What will happen during the upcoming minimum of sun activity? Previous periodes of that kind brought global cooling and extreme whether patterns... To bind the whole climate to CO2 is obviosly nonsense as history and climate records prove. Just rember the ice age fear from the 70ies or the fast melting period in the first halfe of the 20st century. Oh, NOAA and friends Just removed them recently.

Ok cool. Nothing is "Impossible", another haitus can come and you do not know why, another mini ice age will come and you do not know when, the heating might go on since the interglacial is not over and it is clear what you will say why that is. The truth is that the lowest threshold of 1,5°C is by now the new high. This underlines that there is no expressivness whatsoever, except that it will not be 3°C or 4,5°C., instead it is just a normal trend in no meaning exceptional or unpreceded. And this only makes sense if we look into the past, where CO2 contadicts the assumed forcing in the ordovician, carbonferous, jurassic, cretateous and now in the cenozoic.

The modells are complicated, yet they still struggle with clouds, and tropologic barriers. There is no expressivness in the IPCC. After 30 years we have to accept the lowest threshold of 1,5°C. The aasumed forcing of CO2 is not possible to be seperated from the natural warming. He even mentions that the IPCC is just one institute, while all bigger countries have there own modells. The russian one is the lowest one and it meets the observations. It is neglecting CO2 as a potential driver.

Further remarks: There are reasons to cut aerosol emissions. For example air quality. But it was discussed if aerosols from ships (where air quality is not important) in large quantity artificially added in the atmosphere could be a possibility to mask the warming. But these would be other aerosols which have a more long-term (and more one directional) effect, not the ones from coal burning. But you are right. It would be interesting to know it more precisely. It would be interesting how much warming due to greenhouse gases have been hidden by aerosols. There is a possibility that we drastically underestimate the greenhouse effect due to CO2 because of this.

But you are correct, much data is in the report; however, the levels of uncertainty are also noted.

God is trying to get this world&#39;s attention to coming events like the Rapture, 7 year tribulation and 2nd coming of Christ. Worry more about being left behind after the Rapture than climate change since the 7 year tribulation will be the worse period in human history especially the last 3 1/2 years when all hell breaks loose. Since prophetic events are on the way repent and turn to Jesus for forgiveness of sins and salvation. The only and easiest way to heaven is through Jesus and Jesus alone. If anyone finds themselves in the tribulation period it is their fault not God&#39;s so accept Jesus as Lord and Savior before it is too late.

That's where climate sensitivity is derived. Of course the climate models tend to get a very similar range or they'd be crap and they cost some tens or I think it's more like hundreds of millions of dollars each. For that money they'd be shit if they couldn't even get something as obvious as climate sensitivity correct. I can do it in my head within +/- 10% because the physics is certainly accurate enough for that.

"This guy thinks CO2 levels are only a manmade occurance. #1 False assumption" We know the increase in CO2 is of human origin. The isotopic concentration of carbon in naturally occurring CO2 and the one that comes from burning fossil fuels is different, and we've measured that the extra CO2 in the atmosphere comes from fossil fuels. You didn't know this because the special interest groups that pump millions in disinformation to make sure you don't react are making sure of it. They are lying to you and they are using the same tactics that tobacco companies used in the 60s-90s. Three fronts: deny it's happening at all, deny it's their fault, deny it's a bad thing. All at the same time, even when the arguments contradict each other.	UCiwx_xHCGFWL8y8P4SMaOQg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiwx_xHCGFWL8y8P4SMaOQg	1	UgzBnCScXTAtruN2EZp4AaABAg	Mark Kaidy

I hope Sabine considers doing a second interview with Prof. Palmer on the difference between weather and climate. I have seen some comments that reveal how confusing is for some that distinction and worst, how they draw false conclusions as to the importance of climate predictions. The argument goes like this if you can&#39;t predict weather out to three weeks (because of the chaotic nature of the atmosphere-ocean-cryosphere system) how then can you expect to get climate predictions right. This question is as old as climate science and it would be nice to hear it from Prof. Palmer.	UCGU2PiqP3h9DSWSZLtZZUkQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGU2PiqP3h9DSWSZLtZZUkQ	0

It&#39;s almost as if he&#39;s not working tools like mathematics or the laws of physics although he claims the opposite. His hemming and hawing is almost unbearable. I believe that if he passed gas while he was answering a question he would have to adjust his statements to reflect that change. Making it ridiculously hard to weed through his blathering doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s intelligent or even very smart at all. Societal concerns mean - or should mean - nothing to the scientific investigation of any phenomenon. Where did all the hurricanes go after Katrina? You remember - the year AFTER Katrina was supposed to have a record number of even worse hurricanes. Didn&#39;t happen. In fact, for years the intensity and number were far less than average.

It does not follow the scientific method <br /> 2. it relies on &quot;consensus&quot; rather than rigorous review to establish its credibility <br /> 3. it is highly dogmatic, does not tolerate dissent <br /> 4. it uses children as a defensive shield to prevent rational discussion <br /> 5. it hides its data, most of which is tax funded and therefore should be legally public <br /> 6. <b>NONE</b> of the catastrophic predictions have come to pass... <br /> 7. it relies on predictive &quot;models&quot; ( none of which agree ) rather than sound empirical methods <br /> 8. it is heavily promoted by society&#39;s most untrustworthy: <br /> a) politicians <br /> b) media <br /> 9. it promotes <b>TAXATION</b> as its primary solution <br /> <br />In short: it is a cult which some have credibly argued is the long sought-after One World Religion. <br />Think about it.

It is what plate tectonics and vulcanism will do over time anyway, until the point of not enough energy left in the system and plants die (US too). Some way to go to make a climate model indistinguishable from reality? Are you effing insane? The Earth&#39;s climate system has a PRACTICALLY INFINITE number of variables, and when you can measure them all you still will not have enough information to make a prediction that is good for more than 5 DAYS anyway.

If you meant "overfitting", these global climate models aren't fitted statistical models (like statistical regression), these are physical models. They don't try to fit a function to a set of data points, they model the actual physical processes governing climate. The uncertainty comes from local effects that affect climate but instead of modeled they're parametrised (like clouds), it's the whole "grid resolution" issue that Prof. Palmer keeps mentioning. I hope this clarifies a couple of things for you.	UCiwx_xHCGFWL8y8P4SMaOQg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiwx_xHCGFWL8y8P4SMaOQg	1	Ugzdm6gMypxTWHQ9WK54AaABAg	David Wilson

I won't be holding my breath. Just in case, here are a couple of links to detailed analyses of the performance of GCMs (because obviously scientists have to assess how each others' models are performing, and it's not difficult to do): https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00243-w https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2943/study-confirms-climate-models-are-getting-future-warming-projections-right/ (along with the one I posted earlier) And if you're thinking climate science is all about GCM's, that's also completely false: https://escholarship.org/uc/item/3428v1r6 I'm a physicist, by the way. The climate is a physical system. You could learn about it, it's genuinely fascinating. The physicists discussing it in the video understand it very well. Alternatively, you can continue to trot out denialist clichés and silly excuses for ever. It's pathetic, it's infantile, it's dull, predictable and transparent. If you can't find the courage to look this issue in the face, that's where you'll stay. Fairyland. Where everything is just fine. With all your fairyland friends. Here's a nice intro to the physics, in case you're interested: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUFOuoD3aHw And the 4.5 billion year history of the planet: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujkcTZZlikg The science is real.

I’m sorry that you typed all that bullshit under the apparent impression that anyone takes you or your views seriously! But also I’m grateful for the amusement I got out of you distinguishing “sunlight” and “IR emitted from the ground” along with apparently buying that argument about water absorption without noticing that the point is that the water absorption would occur and has been occurring without any human activity, so any absorption by CO2, no matter how little relative to water absorption, is trapping additional energy on the planet—the warming from water is required to produce normal temperatures after all—you have to be careful just aping arguments you learn from YouTube videos. The funniest part was the bit about whether or not I can read a book...I read one or two, in part at least, while getting my PhD in biophysics. ;) Type as much as you like in response it couldn’t possibly do anything but amuse me!

It supposedly comes from c02 absorbing infrared emitted primarily from the ground at night. And it does extremely little of that and absorbs very small bands of infrared wavelengths that are almost all already absorbed by water vapor which is a far, far more powerful greenhouse gas because of the assymetric shape of the H2O molecule, which is responsible for virtually the entire greenhouse effect without which the earth would go subzero every night. CO2 absorbs only a few small wavelengths that are already almost entirely absorbed by water vapor, it has a tiny, marginal effect, at best. You’re so smug because you hide behind paid propagandists without even the slightest clue as to even the basic physical theory behind the religion you defend without evidence. Sad really.

If he did check, he would find that the later is not the case. That begets the question, &quot;Does Prof Palmer lack integrity or is he not skilled in basic cause-effect analysis or is he just a follower and not a critical scientist?&quot; <br /><br /><br />If he did a check of the Hadley Climate timeseries on CO2 and T, he would find the opposite of what he is saying. I&#39;ve done those checks. Hadley, NASA, NOAA, Spencer, RSS, Berkeley, MLO, and TCC all show the same signal. Prof Palmer, do you have the integrity to check your own database and report the results?	UCsVmVh7t_uFkdxu00uw1bQw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsVmVh7t_uFkdxu00uw1bQw	0

If you ever get the courage to test your own belief, let me know. I'll be glad to walk you through the database downloads, autocorrelations, cross correlations, and non-linear regressions. You would be impressed by what climate scientists have collected. You can get as simple or as complex as you want. But what I found interesting was that no matter how simple or complex the analysis got, the fingerprints in all climate-science time series said the same thing. CO2 has been damping the rise in T during the past 61 years of the Holocene Optimum.

If that's all it takes then your ability to account for confounding variables by just looking at 1D correlations of two scalar quantities is very impressive! From my pov with my head buried in the sand, all of these different "emergent properties" should be mediated by a ton of other factors in the ennvironment and looking a just the datasets you reference I wouldn't expect to be able to draw conclusions, but if I had a model, on the other hand, which specified the leading-order causal relationships between potential confounding variables then I might know what else I should look up before making inferences about how CO2 effects temperature other than via direct absorption.

It is a life-giving gas for flora (cools). It is associated with aerosols that reflects ETSR (cools). It??? We sometimes only focus on what is beside us. It's like standing next to the compressor of an air-conditioner and only seeing the heat coming off of the compressor and concluding that this mysterious device heats the atmosphere. Yes, it does. The question is do you want to see the total picture? Or are you locked into only seeing what the compressor does? If Prof Palmer took the time to actually test his country's premier CO2 and T dataset, he would see the larger picture and see not just the GHG effects of CO2 (which by the way are quite powerful), but he would see the other effects of CO2 and see the net or total effect. Joseph, I believe that you are from the US. The US has a plethora of premier datasets on CO2 and T. The one closest to you is probably NOAA (but MLO, Berkeley, NASA, Spencer, RSS also have incredible datasets). If you test the NOAA CO2 and T datasets, they will reveal the truth to you as they have done for many of us. But my guess is that you and Prof Palmer won't look. And that is OK. Scientists need to be courageous enough to be wrong to lead the paradigm shift to new discovery. I was wrong until I looked that the datasets that climate scientists swear by. The datasets gave me quite an education. I was so stunned that I decided to test all the datasets. You are correct. CO2 is a GHG. Its effect is off-the-chart quick and strong. But, there is "the rest of the story". It's all in prof Palmer's dataset, your dataset (as a US taxpayer), the TCC dataset ... all 13 datasets, to be precise. They all say the same thing.

Even Mr. Palmer has to resort to &quot;denier&quot; as the preferred designation of sceptics, he might as well say &quot;heretic&quot; or &quot;unbeliever&quot;<br />As I watched I hoped you were going to get through his boring avoidance of any point and nail him with a sceptical question. I was disappointed. Instead we listened to useless discussions about the necessity of removing carbon from out once-prosperous economy instead of common sense flood control. Energy poverty is real, is it not? More people die from cold than heat.<br /><br />The models are symptomatic of what you called postdiction in the LIGO video, always tuned (parameterized) to give a result of increasing temperature. Anyone who deviates from that goal has a very short tenure and no funds in Climate Science. If the past is too difficult to parameterize the past is modified {&quot;we must remove the Medieval warming&quot;) or the present is misrepresented. To increase the average global temperature just tweak the computation of Sea Surface Temperature (SST version 1 version 2, etc.).<br /><br />Storms have not gotten worse, only the reporting.<br />Study the Sun not CO2.

Even below that, the processes aren't just 'made up'. There's some rationale behind it, even if it has to involve some guesswork, to try to patch the discrete to the continuous with some reasonable assumptions about what the effects of clouds or mountains or cities should be – this is an entire area of research on its own.

We’re moving through an entire galaxy, that in itself contains a type of womb with varying conditions, being affected by other outside electromagnetic processes. I’m not saying humans have no effect on the climate, they obviously do, but let’s get a grip and stop the constant political fear mongering, and work at cleaning up the planet realistically. Every kid I see out protesting climate change, carrying the newest iPhone, and wearing synthetic clothes, is like listening to a new Kafka novel unfold.

Of course this isn&#39;t the case in places like China, where rapid industrialization has polluted the air in that local<br /><br />One question I want to pose is what concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere starts to affect animals.

M. - the problem is that if your model assumes CO2 has a measurable effect on climate, then your model will show that increasing CO2 levels will cause warmer climate in the future. It doesn't really prove anything. Models can not tell anything that isn't already encoded in the premise. Note: None of these charts show the actual uncertainties in the runs, because it is enormous. Therefore they rather show 50 runs, and say that the answer is somewhere in that neighborhood. What if I'm trying to find Pi with data models, and all my models are saying it is 2 + (Random(0,1)) - I get numbers between 2 and 3 and most of the models land at about 2.3-2.7. Does running these models 100 times help? No.	UCMi8XpFyhSFckKSNA8l8Cxg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMi8XpFyhSFckKSNA8l8Cxg	1	UgzZ2-h8NtnWmbYgQDh4AaABAg	Dan Casey

How much is natural variation caused by the Earth, Sun, etc." We do know this, and Prof. Palmer explains this very well in this video (4:00). He states very clearly in the video that the upward trend in average global temperature caused by humans, is an easy accurate prediction with the current models (7:49 - 10:29 - 12:44). What do you think that meant? What we can't predict, yet, are the local effects (what, when and where the specific effects of the human caused raise in average temperature will happen). We know the current drastic increase in global temperatures is caused by human activity. That's pretty much all we can say with certainty and that's what the interviewee confirms in this video.

Early on in the talk the speaker says that there is no doubt that human activity is increasing global temperature. I agree with this viewpoint.<br /><br /><br />However, the actual global temperature must be made up of the natural background variation plus the variation due to human activity and then the variation due to human activity must have two components first due to CO2 and second due to other (Non CO2) factors attributable to human activity.<br /><br /><br />I agree with everything that is being done to reduce CO2 emissions such as green energy and planting trees but I would like to know what percentage of the problem this is addressing. If the CO2 is only 50% of the problem of human activity causing global warming then we have to also look at other factors. It is known that temperature in the cities is often higher than in the countryside by one or two degrees so this gives a clue that the growth of cities may be a factor in increasing global warming.There may also be other factors which are less easy to control such as water vapour in the atmosphere.<br /><br /><br />I would like to see a more general solution which can mitigate the effect of human generated warming plus also variation in solar activity. I would like to see the testing of a space based solution to address the problem in the longer term. Start with a single sun screening unit which is able to unfold a screen which is 20m x 20m covering an area of 400 m^2 and can be placed in space at the Lagrange L1 point which is 1.5 million km from Earth in the direction of the sun. The test would show the technology of screening the suns rays and show that a single unit can be placed in a stable and controlled position and be controlled from Earth to furl and unfurl the screen. <br /><br /><br />To have any effect on global temperature there would probably have to be maybe thousands or even millions of these devices in the vicinity of the Lagrange L1 point. Creating one such device would not be a huge investment. Creating millions of units would be a huge investment but it seems that the scale of the problem of climate change would justify such an investment. Before having a noticeable effect on average global temperature such a system might be able to have a local effect on specific badly affected areas of the globe.<br />Richard	UC_M96Y52WsIPMxjtyut4MOw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_M96Y52WsIPMxjtyut4MOw	0

Why is the warmth of the dust bowl era in America not represented?

Ugznj95HZndcKjd5wp94AaABAg	30	1	2019-11-16 13:06:03	Hans Vetter	YES! Scientists got the climate change COMPLETELY WRONG! ... In what aspect? ... well ... in that they claim it is a man made climate change. This is scientifically plain wrong! <br /> Why? ... well ... because infrared-active trace gases like water vapor (H2O) and carbon oxid (CO2) cannot store absorbed infrared radiation by transfering it into kinetic energy in form of oscillations of the molecules. The physical reason for it is that the oscillation relaxation time of CO2-molecules is in the order of 0.1ps (pico-seconds) but the molecule flight time between collisions of air molecules at 1 atmosphere and 59°F (288K) is around 147ps. So by a factor of more than 1000 longer in time ... <br /> So each infrared-active molecule like CO2 has re-emitted isotrop (in all directions) the upfront absorbed ir-photon (13um..17um) far before the next collision with another air molecule. What that means? ... well ... it makes clear that CO2 can only COOL the earth, because it scatters only half of the emitted radiation back, which still is a 50% energy loss for the earth, which is scattered towards space. By scattering energy back to earth, which got radiated by the earth upfront tells us only that this mechanism of COOLING the earth gets slightly slowed down, but it is still COOLING the earth! <br /> In numbers: <br />Sun constant is 1361 W/m2 coming in ... averaged to the whole surface of the earth to 342 W/m2 (1361/4) ... <br /> 23% gets converted into chemical energy of ozone (O2 =&gt; O3) and 29% is the albedo effect (reflections by clouds &amp; ozeans) ... so that only 48% of sun radiation reaches the earth surface! <br /> From this 48% the biggest part of 25% gets into water evaporation for building clouds in the troposphere and 5% goes into conduction into the lowest air level of the troposphere ... <br /> The atmospherical window (8um..12um) let additional 13% go into space as direct energy loss for the earth ... so that only the rest of around 5% gets radiated by the earth in form of infrared radiation (4um..66um). Most of it gets absorbed by water vapor (H2O) and just 0.5% or 1,7 W/m2 gets absorbed by CO2 and half of it (0.8 W/m2) scatters back to the earth surface ... what climate alarmists call &quot;atmospheric back radiation&quot; ... lol ... <br /> NOBODY deny climate! What they deny is the man made climate change, which the alarmists called at the beginning &quot;global warming&quot; ... lol ... I call it the CO2-lie! We are all witnessing the biggest science scam of all times! ... made by the &quot;scientific&quot; church-of-global-warming!

Up to now you haven't named one. You gave only wrong arguments. By the way. If you try to ask something to deduce if the other person knows basic physics don't make it so easy. One way to transfer energy from a photon to a molecule is by it having a dipole moment. Water molecules are dipoles in their ground state. The distance of charge separation roughly depermines the frequency of the photos from which energy can be transfered. The strength of the dipole determines the probability of the transfere happening. By the way. CO2 has no non-zero dipole moment in the ground state (as CO2 has two axis of reflection symmetry). But it is a dipole in a significant amount of time due to thermal collisions. But also molecules without a dipole moment but other charge separations allow transfere of energy from photons. Dipole moments are sufficient but not necessary ... .

This is ONLY done by conduction at the surface of the oceans after absorbing the shorter wavelength radiation coming from the sun.

And by the way ... "slowing the cooling" is still COOLING! ... CO2 can ONLY COOL the earth, but never ever "warm" it! ... and the effect is just 0.8 W/m2 from 342 W/m2 or 0.25% of the sun constant averaged to the whole earth surface, which is 342 W/m2. You need to differentiate between different forms of energy. There is kinetic energy (translation, oscillation & rotation) and radiaton energy (photons). The transformation process is called 'absorption' & 'emission'. Only condensed matter is capable of transforming absorbed radiation into kinetic energy! ... what you call 'thermal energy' ... why is that? ... well ... because condensed matter has no 'flight time' between collisions of molecules ...

Modulo irrelevant scientific errors your main conclusion in the middle is exactly what science says. Let's just forget that we can warm water vaper by IR light. Let's forget that you ignored that energy will end up in thermal energy and get radiated out (which makes your second part completely wrong). Let's just assume your argumentation in the first part is right because it is not on the bottom of this argument. Then CO2 stops the earth from cooling 100% of the otherwise radiated IR-energy to only 50%. And if a photon in mean hits a CO2 molecule twice before leaving the earth it will cool down only by 25%. *Greenhouse gases slow down the cooling of the planet.* Congratulations that is exactly what science says.

Why mislead the public if the science is settled? That’s the actions of politicians, not scientists. Models are always wrong but sometimes useful. What is not useful is when data has been tampered with to fit the models. This is not a problem just isolated to climate change which really brings into question the current mindset of the most protected and unquestioned group on earth; scientists. <br /><br />I wonder how long Tim Palmer will keep his tenure after subtly wording his answers here. The trouble with science is the protectionist culture surrounding it. Scientist are too scared to do their job which is to unequivocally tell FACTS based on actual evidence. When we have timidity in the face of an overwhelming threat of being sacked from your job seems to me to be an ideological cult rather than a space of free investigation. That is corruption 101.

We know that the earths average has varied through time a couple of degrees or so, but in the models there is no variation at all. We know now the earths orbit and the suns variations, why are they not included. The trend to 2100 is only up and up?!?

But is it abnormal? <br /><br />Similar floods have occurred before. There&#39;s references to the mid-nineteenth century with similar floods right there. See: <a href="https://doncasterhistory.wordpress.com/local-history-2/doncaster-floods-through-time/">https://doncasterhistory.wordpress.com/local-history-2/doncaster-floods-through-time/</a><br />CO2 levels from human activity were very low back then. What caused the extreme weather back then? Please do some research for yourself. Disasters have always happened throughout history and will happen forever. Climate has not changed enough (and I doubt it ever will) to be responsible for a flood or a drought once in a while.

It's warmed they make claims and invent a name for critical thinkers and call them deniers. The real deniers are those that deny science. The real reasons for the warming is not because of Co2. The IPCC report cherry picks data for a low TSI of 0.05WM2 when in fact it's over 20 times greater. Climate skeptics (like myself) have studied this in detail. There is no evidence for catastrophic global warming based on Co2 output. The CO2 increase is mainly natural and just about every alarmist graph uses Ice core which is monotonic. It's not even an accurate proxy for Co2.	UC_Wc0Fg54cK4LbeHQ0-4fXw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_Wc0Fg54cK4LbeHQ0-4fXw	1	UgwRZcXTuB4jO5ecmqR4AaABAg	Robert Aspindale

Given i) the albedo effects of whiter tropospheric clouds and their profound effect on temperature modulation, ii) the explanatory power of Fourier transforms and PCA - on proxy cosmic ray data related to multiple temporal solar dynamo cycles - for historical temperature proxies, iii) the recent demonstration by Svensmark at al. (2017) showing how cosmic rays can lead to creation of cloud condensation nuclei, iv) the reliable demonstration of cloud cover reductions during Forbush decreases (solar winds reducing incidence cosmic rays) providing real world examples of the solar activity/ cosmic ray/ high albedo cloud effect, v) the attribution of all temperature rise out of the little ice age to CO2 without any attribution to solar activity, vi) the attribution of 33 degrees centigrade (difference between the theoretical temperature of earth without an atmosphere and the actual temperature) to 1 part in 2500 of CO2, with no consideration of the energy added to atmospheric molecules due to work done by gravity compression contributing to total entropy, vii) the fact that at preindustrial CO2 levels, IR quanta at the narrow bandwidths absorbed by the rigid polyatomic CO2 molecule was already saturated, and viii) that most of the absorbed energy is not irradiated back at the earth surface as it is transferred to diatomic N2 and O2 through collisions that raise the atmospheric temperature which then leads to the far more efficient convective transfer upwards of the warmed air (heat loss) ... and I guess that is enough to explain some skepticism?

The records show that it was much hotter in the USA, Europe and Australasia then than it is now (these are the areas for which we have good records). Tens of thousands of people died from the heat. This year in the UK, we had a typically poor summer, damp and cloudy, apart from a couple of "heatwaves" that lasted a few days each. One of those days was apparently a fraction of a degree hotter than the previous hottest day recorded. There were then fear mongering headlines about record high temperatures. No, it was one day in an otherwise crappy summer. If we had another summer like 1976 in the UK now, the climate extremists would be running around like headless chickens. The earth cooled from the 1940s to the 1970s (remember the fears of a new ice age?) and have been warning since. This is cyclical and natural. Climate change has become a new religion. Superstitious people in the past would make sacrifices to the gods in order to bring the rains. Now they want everyone to sacrifice the fruits of civilisation, such as private transport, in a bid to change the weather. If it weren't so serious, it would be hilarious.

The focus has always been since industrialisation. It's simple Pareidolia and the whole CO2 forcing falls on it's face when being scientific and comparing other times it was higher. By adding to the actually mass of the atmosphere the calculations hold up since the added gas was not a part of the atmosphere the temperature rise can be calculated. (as seen in the DR Homes paper) this still leaves out what is causing the modern warm period (that is natural cosmic variations not mentioned by the IPCC). If I can research this for 4 months why are the IPCC claiming to be a panel of experts relying on peer review (that have been found to steer the peer review process in their political self existent environmentalist favour) and why leave out this crucial data? possible because this whole fraud unfolding is making people rich. Willie Soon and the NIPCC point this out. Will Happer points this out, Dick Linzen does and 31,479 others (8000 with PHD's) http://www.petitionproject.org/signers_by_last_name.php?run=all The "consensus" only really exists from suffocated Universities where people have been sacked for an opposing scientific opinion and from the media raking it in too. Science should welcome critical thinking and conflicting data in order to do things better. I mean 70+ climate models is ridiculous but they need to make the predictions work since the IPCC body only exists to prove a link between human activity and climate change. Pollution, de-forestation, fracking problems and plastics aside it's becoming ever more apparent we have little impact on the resent warm period when all the science is considered.

But growing concern about reproducibility is driving many researchers to seek ways to fight their own worst instincts." https://www.nature.com/news/how-scientists-fool-themselves-and-how-they-can-stop-1.18517 On peer review: https://www.vox.com/2015/12/7/9865086/peer-review-science-problems quote: “The Lancet editor Richard Horton has called the process "unjust, unaccountable ... often insulting, usually ignorant, occasionally foolish, and frequently wrong." Not to mention that identifying peer reviewers and getting their comments slows down the progress of science — papers can be held up for months or years — and costs society a lot of money. Scientists and professors, after all, need to take time away from their research to edit, unpaid, the work of others. Richard Smith, the former editor of the BMJ, (Britisch Medical Journal) summed up: "We have little or no evidence that peer review 'works,' but we have lots of evidence of its downside." Another former editor of the Lancet, Robbie Fox, used to joke that his journal "had a system of throwing a pile of papers down the stairs and publishing those that reached the bottom." Not exactly reassuring comments from the editors of the world's leading medical journals.” and yet, "96% of scientists" agree on AGW. Are you kidding me? In Medical science, at least one deals with reproducable (apparently not) facts. A patient gets better , or not. In Climate it is a matter of interpretation of sketchy data. We just showed that scientists even in the medical field, adjust te data to suit the requested narrative. So it would appear to be just opinions of some, parrotted by the many. So, I can only conclude, keeping in mind the above presented data, that whoever came up with that number of 96%, had a political agenda, pushed by mainstream media, (fear sells well) resulting in a cult-like movement, where the slogan "look at the "science" has become the main mantra, without any justification. A sorry state of affairs.	UCmiwpYQS22luLKjr-5vjNaw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmiwpYQS22luLKjr-5vjNaw	1	Ugxbg5_CZU53EwNH3Cd4AaABAg	scsirob

Good luck with that. I drove 2 hours south in my car and got a 5 C difference in temp. Than drove home to a 8 C temperature difference one day later. Collecting data on this subject is ridiculously hard to have certainty about using the data for results that are accurate enough to make me pay more for my life. And furthermore I live in Canada which means climate change is everyone else’s problem. we are carbon neutral as well as only 40 million people.

Yeah, and once there was Pangea and you weren't there either. Europe was much colder yes, and why? It was the medieval cooling that Micheal Mann tried to write out of the data and we are still coming out of it. Temps were higher in the Medieval Warming, The Roman Warming, and The Minoan Warming, but you don't address these facts and obfuscate the debate with NOW, NOW, NOW!!! We don't have a climate catastrophe, we have a cyclical collapse happening that you and your brethren blame on an inert gas. As to your assumptions on what I think or believe or what I do in terms of remedial action, is exactly the way of thinking this PoMo Death Cult uses to kill positive action against pollution or your negative actions involving albedo and geoengineering. I am not, unlike you, trying to destroy this planet or its science for future generations. I am very active in areas that you have no idea about at a national level, not just 'my' little part of it, but these actions are positive for every little part of it. Keep your Hubris and death cult well away from the planet and start getting on the right side of history.

Also notice that the models then diverge from &quot;reality&quot; afterwards, running higher.<br /> So how can a model predict a volcanic eruption? Are they <b><i>THAT</i></b> amazingly prescient? Looks like they were tweaked to fit known points, but fail to predict reality shortly after the tweaking periods.<br /><br /> How this guy claims that models have been pretty good is astounding, unless he ignores the period after 1990 (which is what really matters) and instead rests on the laurels of their results in the yellow &quot;tweak&quot; zone (1960-1990).

That means we don&#39;t have measurements, observations, of key factors, and their variations, in the same resolution scaled to the human fossil co2 contribution. So they fudge them. You can&#39;t make predictions without measured observations to base them on. The scale needed is you take that graph as the top of a 3 foot pile, representing the total co2 content, with that graph being the top 2 inches representing the average fluctuation of all the natural variables. The amount of human fossil fuel burned over the entire 20th century averaged for 1 year is, on the scale of that graph, one thousandth of an inch. We have that measured to the penny because we pay it at the pump, and publish averages in the paper every day. You can get those numbers from the national petroleum institution. You can go to the library and confirm those numbers for yourself with a day or 2 research in the microfilm newspaper files for the entire 20th century. You would have to observe, measure, and &quot;parameterize&quot; all the natural factors that contribute to that natural fluctuation in the same resolution of that thousandth of an inch of human output to make a scientifically convincing argument that your predictive theory is valid. You don&#39;t even have basic observations even on the most gross scale of measurement let alone on the scale needed to be convincing.

The false global warming claim is about the relationship of human released co2 and the co2 concentration. That you didn't know that is why the "global warming" narrative isn't a convincing scientific argument. The charge to be proved is against the human annual production of 1/10,000% of the total co2 content from fossil sources not against the co2 that is there already. The case global warmists are making is "Here's a body. There's the accused. The butler done it. I rest my case".

M.	@dpsamu2000 " In fact spotting a trend and predicting it will continue can be done knowing absolutely nothing about cause" Physics establish the cause-effect relationship between CO2 concentration and temperature increase. And the model based on that physics has been producing accurate results (and analysis of past data) since forever. Just because you can't pinpoint individual events to the warming it doesn't mean you can't pinpoint the general trend to the general trend predicted by the model. Because that's what's happening.

Arguing that because a "trend" can be seen and "predicting" it will continue, and being accurate isn't support for a claim that any asserted cause is actually the cause. In fact spotting a trend and predicting it will continue can be done knowing absolutely nothing about cause. claimng to know a cause based on a trand and predicting it continuing is a defined fallacious argument. No. Without measuring, not guestimating, fudging, and pulling numbers out of your hat, you can't make scientifically valid claims. Especially when the signal you're claiming you can predict the effect of is thousands of times smaller than the error in the predictions of the variables you're guessing at. It's nothing like predicting where trains will collide. You're pulling that out of your hat. You argue out of utter ignorance. I know this is the first time you even heard mention of the scale of the problem.

"That means we don't have measurements, observations, of key factors, and their variations, in the same resolution scaled to the human fossil co2 contribution" No, it doesn't. It means that we don't have the computational power to actually model those, so they need to be estimated based on observations. Then you have a statistical model with all the caveats of statistical models, and that's why it's hard to predict an exact value of global temperatures in a specific day 100 years in the future. Nevertheless, we can predict the trend with astounding accuracy, and we do know that the effects of that trend are going to be bad, very bad. If you have two trains on the same railroad track running in opposite directions, you might not be able to predict in which point on the track they will collide with absolute accuracy, and which of the passengers will die, which will end up maimed, and which will survive, but it's easy to predict that unless the trains slowdown significantly, and they slowdown sooner rather than later, all of the above will happen.

The Earth is after all getting greener and plants are faster growing because of CO2 fertilization. The poor of the world are much richer because of the new technology invented in the west which was made possible by capitalism and freedom of expression and free publication of information. If the poor countries adopted a constitution like that in Switzerland they would probably cease to be poor by the fastest realistic method, know to man. So if some say that the west has been economically net damaging the poor countries, I have to disagree. It often seems to be politically incorrect to say that the west has not continually done economical damage to poor nations since the European Enlightenment. And I wonder, has the more CO2 in the atmosphere also been a net benefit to the poor countries, Ceteris Paribus?	UC0Oz8tvYj9Cj-oQ-mwU_m5w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0Oz8tvYj9Cj-oQ-mwU_m5w	0

First, greening can disappear overnight and thus any warming due to greening can also disappear overnight. Take for example a case where Greens achieve their goal to return CO2 to 300ppm? With our excessively greened world, that excess greenery will gasp even more CO2 from the atmosphere and CO2 will plummet precipitously. 300ppm will overshoot to 50ppm and all plants on earth will die. Within one-week, the earth will brown. Within one-week and one-day, global desertification (browning) will eliminate any so-called global-warming. <br /><br />Global-warming is therefore, a transitory effect. The same effect a jungle has on local climate. In Africa, the desert battles the jungle over millennia. Vast portions of the Sahara shift between desert and green. Israel is now green, where it was recently (a hundred-years ago) was desert. Attributed to irrigation, most of Africa&#39;s greening is actually due to CO2 (including Israel bordering Africa). <br /><br />The world is said to be warmer, because the continents are greener, not because of permanent solar capture (Climatologists incorrectly attribute global-warming to solar capture). That&#39;s why sea-level predictions are wrong. It&#39;s why polar ice models are wrong. Because CO2 is not a direct driver of solar energy capture, but rather acts through (local) greening. It&#39;s also why CO2 global-warming will never go nonlinear, never hockey-stick and is not permanent. <br /><br />Finally, transitory CO2 greening must never be reversed, especially not suddenly. Because if Leftist Greens ever get their wish to lower CO2, the world&#39;s plant-life will die just as suddenly. Global-cooling can and someday surely will go non-linear, hockey-stick, but global-warming can&#39;t and won&#39;t.

Green-New-Deal proposes to end all fossil-fuel use essentially immediately. Either of these will cause catastrophic CO2-depletion. Because the world is now 30% greener than it was forty-years ago, any sudden CO2 reduction will cause plant-life to gasp for CO2, just like we'd gasp for oxygen if oxygen were suddenly reduced? And since there are now far more plants, their gasp will deplete CO2 below where plants can survive. (more...) Ask yourself what CO2 level would plant-life choose? (hint 1,500ppm). And what level is CO2 now? (hint 400ppm). Plants are already starved for CO2. Climatologists and your gov't-paid K-12 teachers lied to you. The world doesn't have too much CO2, it has too little.

Any number of natural or man-made catastrophes could shut-down man-made CO2 production? A nuclear war, asteroid, global-scale earthquake, etc. could cause fossil-fuel power plants to shut down? Global shut-down of power-plants for as little as one-week could precipitate CO2 depletion. Exactly what Leftist climate-Greens seek (lower CO2-levels), could kill us all through famine.

Note that as this clip goes out there are epic floods going on in the UK and globally, and the sun is well into solar minimum. Herschel and others noticed the sun correlates with cold and wet yet these guys ride on the fack that solar activity has increased over the last 100 years, warming the climate and venting more CO2.

That&#39;s what you get; first year college math on differential equations teaches you that. Their models are incredibly crude compared to the actual complexity of the earth&#39;s totality, and won&#39;t until the next generation take into account solar eruptions and flares. The certainty that these climate modelers give for their prediction is unwarranted, given that they tweak the model to fit the past. If you ran the model from year zero it wouldn&#39;t fit the curve. So to a great extent they are cheating. Its like a model that predicts the lottery winners which has embedded in it the past winners, so you get a false sense of its accuracy. If i was double checking their model, i would subtract all the training data past a certain point, and then see if it matches. Before we make billion dollar decisions, we should double check their work with outside auditors, because they have a vested interest in predicting doom, which of course stimulates their budgets. Greed is an extremely powerful force, and they are not immune to it. The amount of power and control that the are implying the government needs to drastically change our energy and transport industry is also a massive temptation.

Please remove the unnecessary unscientific nonsense. Don't waste other peoples time. - You don't have to know the initial conditions for a chaotic system as the pseudo random walk due to the chaotic behaviour changes between the initial conditions no matter what. - Averaging takes care of the high frequency variability. The more chaotic the system is, the easier the estimates after averaging are. Hence: You don't need to know the initial conditions precisely and you don't need to simulate the next day ... precisely in order to make accurate predictions about averaged values in chaotic systems. Chaotic systems are in this regard simpler than non-chaotic systems due to their pseudo-random behaviour.

I am familiar with scientific computing of this kind. Giant matrices that chop of the earth into little chunks and then you run the fluid dynamics and thermodynamic equations on that matrix. Keeps a computer very busy. Since accurate simulations require knowledge of initial conditions, which we don't have at all, they are making assumptions all over the place. If the result of the model is a single number for earth for the whole year, what does that number even mean really? All over the earth the temperature is going up and down during the day wildly. If someone told you that they had a computer program that predicted the stock market, would you believe it? The stock market is controlled by only a few ten thousand banks and rich individuals; child's play compared to the entire earth. But nobody dares claim they can predict the future market because everyone knows that is impossible; yet the climate scientists boldly claim precise numbers. How about they put their predictions on the internet for the next 10 years, and the ones that are way off get de-funded. We need to put some rigor into this discussion. A lot of very expensive decisions are riding on this, and sloppy work should be weeded out. Not everyone is good at this kind of programming that cuts across so many disciplines.

You think you learned that because they gave you only the simplest realistic equations. For every function you can build a differential equation the solution of which is exactly this function. For example the function Given by f(x)=1/(x²+1) Calculate the derivative f'(x)=-2x/(1+x²)² Try to simplify it using the function. For example f‘(x)=-2xf(x)² There you have your differential equation y'=-2xy². You prefer homogeneous differential equations? No problem y'=-y² will do it (same method).

The effect that CO2 has on temp is known science.<br />3. Too many people think it&#39;s all a conspiracy to tax them more.<br />4. To have much effect on decreasing CO2 output we would have to make big changes and the bigger the change the more inertia in the change.<br />5. We have invested enough CO2 to ensure that temp will rise for decades to come.<br />Relax, it is too late to avoid serious effects. Everyone give up stop debating just live your lives as you please.

Transmits visible (ie sunlight) and blocks infrared at wavelengths beyond 2.7 um (radiation from the ground). Hence the similar temperature rises in different greenhouses. This utterly swamps the effect of CO2 in a greenhouse. The term greenhouse effect is by analogy, the CO2 having a similar effect as the glass, though on a different scale.

This imparts it a touch of scientism, but it is a lure. The principles that drive climate change are conservation principles. We need a thermodynamics simulation, but even thermodynamics is a bad model of climate because all scales are involved and intertwined. Actually, climatology isn't a scientific discipline as we know them. It need developments we haven't yet. In short, the scientists are not gods and they have limits, climatology being still beyond these limits.

There is a limit to c02 forcing. Water vapour is the biggest greenhouse gas and yet this can not be blamed on humans. Vapour is 65% of warming apparently. So whilst I really do believe in sustainability and not polluting the earth. For me c02 is not the culprit. Nasa verify that c02 has increased foliage growth. It has some warming effect. I add a planet close the the sun has massive co2 and a run away greenhouse. Humans were not there for that warming and was entirely a consequence of volcanic and plate movement. In the past volcanic eruption put carbon in the air and created a subsequent boom in land life. This boom in life through carbon increase is well documented. But we shall see. As state climate can have tipping points. Evidence suggests that also.	UCITpj1rwTAskh4WM9hCOklw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCITpj1rwTAskh4WM9hCOklw	1	UgygCuidAr5hF0oM8ax4AaABAg	Nicholas Mills

Neither in discussions with people developing these models, nor in the publications dependent on their results (I worked with the UN through four successive rounds of IPCC reports) have I seen evidence of increased statistical confidence in the bounds of their models. Rather, I have observed increased sophistication (coupled atmosphere/ocean interaction; decreasing cell size and vertical lamination; more stochastic effects) but always within fairly constant statistical uncertainty... almost like "we can compute more better faster than 20 years ago, but we include greater variability just so we can't be held to greater account.".

So why did I find this conversation so deeply unsatisfying? Part of it was because Prof Palmer went on so long about basic points that it started to sound obfuscatory. Why are there no uncertainties in the IPCC outcomes? It sounds like the short answer is we have no idea how to calculate them. Taking the ensemble of different groups&#39; knob twisting (the sub-grid parameterisations) is a measure of ignorance, not uncertainty.<br /><br />I think Sabine hits on this when she asks why, then, do the different models diverge. Again, the answer is nebulous but it seems to be down to different groups&#39; opinion on which parameterisations are important. And finally, when Sabine asks what can be done about it, Prof Palmer seems to completely misinterpret the question. He starts talking about policy responses instead of the difficulties with the models.<br /><br />Given Sabine&#39;s history of appropriate, impartial, and dare I say <i>brave</i> , skepticism regarding fundamental physics, I&#39;d be very interested to hear her opinion as to how satisfactory these climate models are. She&#39;s in the same &quot;educated but non-expert&quot; position as the rest of us trying to evaluate the claims. The stakes are high as both action and inaction have potentially very high costs. Personally, after hearing one of the <i>inventors</i> of the climate models in this video, I&#39;m even less convinced than I was. But I want to keep an open mind.<br /><br />I would be interested to hear some more quantitative assessment of the models. How <i>many</i> parameters are inserted by hand? How many could be replaced by proper physical models if we had finer grid resolution. How far away are we from having the computing resources to do this? How <i>much</i> uncertainty is introduced by not having formulas for computing cloud cover? (I gather there are also opposite effects of albedo vs. radiative trapping for high and low altitude clouds). In short, help us understand the uncertainties and let&#39;s not be shy about any shortcomings of the models on such a crucial question.

Current state-of-the-art climate models span a range of 2.6–4.1°C, most clustering around 3°C" (Rahmstorf 2008).  Several studies have put the lower bound of climate sensitivity at about 1.5°C,on the other hand, several others have found that a sensitivity higher than 4.5°C can't be ruled out." "One recent study examining the Palaeocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (about 55 million years ago), during which the planet warmed 5-9°C, found that "At accepted values for the climate sensitivity to a doubling of the atmospheric CO2 concentration, this rise in CO2 can explain only between 1 and 3.5°C of the warming inferred from proxy records" (Zeebe 2009).  This suggests that climate sensitivity may be higher than we currently believe" "Comparisons of observed and modeled coolings after the eruptions of Agung, El Chichón, and Pinatubo give implied climate sensitivities that are consistent with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) range of 1.5–4.5°C. The cooling associated with Pinatubo appears to require a sensitivity above the IPCC lower bound of 1.5°C, and none of the observed eruption responses rules out a sensitivity above 4.5°C."

And this shows me that you continue to completely miss the point. " Nope, I'm not missing the point "you are making". My comment regarding "likely to be in between the best and worst case scenarios" was in reference to that temperature range coming to fruition. And given that it's not just about "twiddling knobs" I would say that's likely. "The most fundamental metric -- the equilibrium climate sensitivity -- simply isn't known, at least to within a factor of two or three." The sensitivity of the Earth’s climate to increases in atmospheric CO2 concentration is, as you rightly imply, a question that sits at the heart of climate science. And it's true that as yet we don't have a 100% precise answer. Currently we have an estimate that has a range of something like 1.5 to 4 degrees if I remember correctly. But that estimate isnt just fiddling with knobs as you put it. Feedbacks drive uncertainty of course, both positive and negative feedback's and there's extremely strong evidence that positive feedback's will amplify warming, based on the Earth’s past, and indeed the physical processes involved. Water vapour is the best understood feedback and measurements from satellites confirm that water vapour concentrations have been increasing in step with temperatures in the atmosphere over the past few decades. There are additional methods used, for example the study of present day volcanic eruptions that give us a pretty good idea that our estimated sensitivity range is correct. Again, climatologists arent morons. So what are we to do if your premise is correct (it isnt)? Assume that at some arbitrary date that "it wont be too bad" and that "all will be okay". We cant assume that. But what we can do of course is look at the impact climate change is having on the environment and the lives of people NOW! And when we do that we see that tropical storms are increasing in frequency, glaciers have shrunk, ice on rivers and lakes is breaking up earlier, plant and animal ranges have shifted and trees are flowering sooner, low lying islands already threatened. And here in the UK where I reside, an increase in flooding is already being experienced. Meanwhile we are still pumping out prodigious quantities of CO2 and chopping down rain forest at a frighting rate. So I don't think we have to be geniuses to realise that, despite climate sensitivity being an estimate, the impacts we are seeing now are just a taste of what's to come. So yes, I still don't see your "adapt rather than mitigate" strategy as logical. Adapt and mitigate best we can maybe. "Anyone professing to be concerned about anthropogenic warming had better a) start lobbying like crazy for new nuclear, b) lobby like crazy for funding of technology breakthroughs like fusion and the Allam cycle." You bet. We don't have to worry about fusion though. Plenty of funding there. ITER main reactor building is now complete and plenty of private companies beavering away we speak. "In the worst case, the world actually isn't going to burst into flames, no matter what certain sinister people are preaching to our kids." The world/planet isn't no, but if anything but the best case scenario comes to pass, ultimately the human race will be in deep shit. And then if indeed that worst case scenario does come to pass, future generations will look back on us with disdain. "The ensemble of models are the result of tweaking knobs with unknown effects." Or more accurately... "Modern sensitivity estimates are based on evidence from many different sources, including models, observations and palaeoclimate estimates. As Dessler suggests, one of the main advances in understanding of climate sensitivity over the past few decades is scientists’ ability to more confidently rule out very high or very low climate sensitivities." I think we should give scientists a bit more credit.	UCf9OPsS0o4ePBlUaMeRq6-g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf9OPsS0o4ePBlUaMeRq6-g	1	Ugxcswil3F8gmqP9kdJ4AaABAg	ps200306

And this shows me that you continue to completely miss the point. You are assuming that you are dealing with normally distributed random variables, and therefore the central limit theorem applies. If that were true then the most likely outcomes would indeed be the ones that the IPCC plots half way between worst and best cases. But it _isn't_ true. The ensemble of models are the result of tweaking knobs with unknown effects. The most fundamental metric -- the equilibrium climate sensitivity -- simply isn't known, at least to within a factor of two or three. So it's not a case of RCP 8.5 being a range of 2 to 5 degrees, with 3.5 being the most likely. There isn't even any guarantee that the temperature anomaly will be within the proposed range. We simply don't know. Now, in the abstract the precautionary principle would tell you not to flirt with potentially hazardous outcomes. But we are not dealing with an abstract "will we, won't we" question. We have moved two billion people from poverty to middle class in the last thirty years. Achieving the end of human poverty depends on supplying the energy needs of the rest of the planet which needs it. Even putting it like that assumes some sort of godlike power of deciding whether we will bestow these benefits on the most deserving. But we don't have that power. Countries are going to modernise whatever "we" want. China is going to build 300 new coal-fired power plants in the course of its Belt and Road initiative, while countries like the UK hmmm and hawww about whether they'll shut down their single remaining coal plant. All the kicking and screaming of climate activists will be useless at best, and will harm their own economies at worst. Vast additional energy resources are going to be utilised, like it or not. On the current trajectory, renewables will grow at a rapid pace, but conventional energy use will also grow. Anyone professing to be concerned about anthropogenic warming had better a) start lobbying like crazy for new nuclear, b) lobby like crazy for funding of technology breakthroughs like fusion and the Allam cycle. Personally I think those will come to pass and we will look back on the current hysteria as quaint. In the mean time, don't worry about things you can't change. In the worst case, the world actually _isn't_ going to burst into flames, no matter what certain sinister people are preaching to our kids.

RCP 2.6 in 2100, as a mean, as I said, is higher than today, due to the inertia in the system I would have thought. RCP 2.6 refers to mitigation scenarios, our attempt to limit warming to 2 degrees. In terms of the spread, best case scenario is that we keep temperature at today’s level. Worst case scenario, with successful mitigation, is just under 2 degrees. RCP 8.5 is the “business as usual” scenario. The likely outcome if we don’t make concerted efforts to limit CO2 emissions. In terms of the best case scenario for RCP 8.5, we see a greater than 2 degree temperature rise. Which I’m sure you will agree is likely to bring with it adverse consequences. The worst case scenario for RCP 8.5 is a huge 5 degrees. So if the best case scenario if we don’t do enough to limit emissions is greater than 2 degrees and the worst case scenario is a huge 5 degrees, then clearly that justifies action whether we encounter the best case scenario or worst case scenario. In reality of course, the scenario is likely to be somewhere in between the best and worst case scenario. RCP 4.5 and RCP 6.0 are the consequences of alternative mitigation strategies and in both cases the most likely scenario is 2 degrees. Personally, I seriously doubt we will achieve an RCP 2.5 or 4.5 scenario. Given the procrastination, the resistance to necessary action, I’m thinking we will be lucky to see RCP 6.0, with a likely temp rise of 2 to 3 degrees as a best case scenario. So given the above, I'm afraid I don't see your point regrading being better off saving our resources for climate adaptation instead of spending them on avoidance. Its clear to me that we need to act.	UCf9OPsS0o4ePBlUaMeRq6-g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf9OPsS0o4ePBlUaMeRq6-g	1	Ugxcswil3F8gmqP9kdJ4AaABAg	ps200306

I think we can be pretty sure that's not going to happen given our dismal record so far. Look at the instrumental temp record from the beggining of the industrial revolution to now. We see a sharp rise, the infamous hockey stick graph. It would be utterly illogical to believe that without reducing emmisions, suddenly the rise in tempreture abates. Of course it wont. The causal factor remains, our emmisions. So without action and the causal factor remaining, of course temps will continue to rise. I have scientific qualifications too. But that wasnt what i said.

No, the spread of values is not all upward, it includes a range of values less than today's temperature. Now, that is for a low emissions scenario. The graphs are for a range of so-called Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP). See the spreads in the vertical bars on the right hand side. All of the pathways have overlapping outcome values. The two central pathways have temperature anomalies between 1.1 and 3.1 degrees. How useful is that in terms of making policy decisions? Not very. At 1.1 degrees we are almost certainly better off saving our resources for climate adaptation instead of spending them on avoidance. The fact that temperature is going up is simply not enough, and the climate models are not being especially helpful.

"Because scientists know which wavelengths of energy each greenhouse gas absorbs, and the concentration of the gases in the atmosphere, they can calculate how much each gas contributes to warming the planet. Carbon dioxide causes about 20 percent of Earth’s greenhouse effect; water vapor accounts for about 50 percent; and clouds account for 25 percent. The rest is caused by small particles (aerosols) and minor greenhouse gases like methane. Water vapor concentrations in the air are controlled by Earth’s temperature. Warmer temperatures evaporate more water from the oceans, expand air masses, and lead to higher humidity. Cooling causes water vapor to condense and fall out as rain, sleet, or snow. Carbon dioxide, on the other hand, remains a gas at a wider range of atmospheric temperatures than water. Carbon dioxide molecules provide the initial greenhouse heating needed to maintain water vapor concentrations. When carbon dioxide concentrations drop, Earth cools, some water vapor falls out of the atmosphere, and the greenhouse warming caused by water vapor drops. Likewise, when carbon dioxide concentrations rise, air temperatures go up, and more water vapor evaporates into the atmosphere—which then amplifies greenhouse heating.

The reason, of course, is that the mechanism of a greenhouse is to limit heat losses by convection. Carbon dioxide has absolutely nothing to do with limiting convection." Wrong! The greenhouse mechanism is not about convection, its about radiation. Morse cut and paste, hope you like it. "The effect is a result of how energy interacts with the atmosphere. Sunlight enters the atmosphere as ultraviolet and visible light; some of this solar energy is then RADIATED back toward space as infrared energy, or heat. The atmosphere is 78 percent nitrogen and 21 percent oxygen, which are both gases made up of molecules containing two atoms. These tightly bound pairs don't absorb much heat. But the greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, water vapor and methane, each have at least three atoms in their molecules. These loosely bound structures are efficient absorbers of the long-wave radiation (also known as heat) bouncing back from the planet's surface. When the molecules in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases re-emit this long-wave RADIATION back toward Earth's surface, the result is warming." Convection still has a role to play though. The greenhouse effect warms the atmosphere as detailed above, and then convection within the atmosphere transports heat around generating what we call weather. Again... this stuff is well understood. In 1896, Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius (who would later win the first-ever Nobel Prize for Chemistry) published a paper in the Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science that laid out the basics of what's now known as "the greenhouse effect." Thats right, we have understood the greenhouse effect for 123 years. Its not open for debate. In fact, if it wasn't for the greenhouse effect this planet of ours would be a cold barren rock. CO2 is the primary temperature regulating gas in the atmosphere.	UCf9OPsS0o4ePBlUaMeRq6-g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf9OPsS0o4ePBlUaMeRq6-g	1	Ugxcswil3F8gmqP9kdJ4AaABAg	ps200306

I won't respond to the first because it's frankly irrelevant. In your third paragraph you outline the hypothesis I was trying to coax out of Martin. However, you did not go so far as to outline the predictions that follow from this hypothesis. The first consequence of increasing CO2 concentrations at higher altitude is heating of the tropopause. This has not been observed. The second consequence of this heating mechanism is that, due to the albedo at extreme latitudes, heating is expected to be greater at those extremes. Also not observed. If a hypothesis cannot make predictions, or if the predictions made are not observed, the hypothesis is wrong.

Tip for you: don't go preaching about "personal understanding of phenomena" when you display none yourself. First of all, the greenhouse effect is a misnomer. Congratulations for knowing that, but there is no climate scientist on the planet who doesn't also know it. Nobody thinks that CO2 acts like the glass in a literal greenhouse. On the other hand your assertion that "ultraviolet insolation is red shifted when it is reflected by the Earth" is completely laughable. About 8% of solar energy reaching the earth is in the ultraviolet. About half of it is already in the infrared and most of the rest at visible wavelengths. It is not "redshifted when reflected". That displays an ignorance of basic physics. It is absorbed, and contributes to warming of the Earth's surface. The Earth then emits blackbody radiation characteristic of its own equilibrium temperature, which happens to be at longer wavelengths since the Earth is considerable cooler than the Sun. You are correct that greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are at saturation level. However, that doesn't mean what you think it does. The excited state of CO2 after absorbing an infrared photon has a short half life. After a fraction of a second it will re-emit that photon or -- much more likely since it collides with other air molecules ten billion times per second -- it will be collisionally de-excited and impart its energy to an oxygen or nitrogen molecule. That's how it contributes to warming. It is only in the upper, more rarefied layer of the atmosphere that the CO2 molecule is more likely to radiate its energy into space without collisional de-excitation. Increasing the CO2 concentration raises the altitude, and thus lowers the temperature, of the layer from which the radiation escapes. To maintain radiative equilibrium, the surface must warm to compensate. That's the "greenhouse effect". You should read about it from a reputable source sometime.

The climate models produce a significant spread of values. That's because we basically don't know the equilibrium climate sensitivity to CO2 within a factor of two. It doesn't really matter whether you call them "wrong" or "not absolutely precisely accurate". Without more precision we cannot know whether extremely expensive mitigation is required.

Your copy-pastes show very little personal understanding of the phenomena you so passionately champion. There is no such thing as a "Greenhouse Effect" in our atmosphere. The reason, of course, is that the mechanism of a greenhouse is to limit heat losses by convection. Carbon dioxide has absolutely nothing to do with limiting convection. Yes, ultraviolet insolation is red shifted when it is reflected by the Earth, and some of that reflected energy is in the absorption bands of CO2. Unfortunately for this early hypothesis, the energy in these bands was already being fully absorbed at much lower CO2 concentrations, i.e. saturated. This led to a revised hypothesis. I can only presume at this point that you were not aware, given that you made no reference to it. You mention the feedback mechanism that highlights the preeminence of water vapor (I'm glad you've acknowledged the fact early on). However, in the context of AGW, you first have to show that there is a mechanism by which increased CO2 can possibly heat the atmosphere, which you haven't (you haven't even availed yourself of the current argument, so you're not even close). Even if you can give a plausible and testable hypothesis for how CO2 heats the atmosphere, you would then need to show causation. Ironically, climatefeedback.org were very quick to reach for this gem in their reply to "No Experimental Evidence for the Anthropogenic Climate Change." However, what they didn't mention is that the literature is replete with the hypothesis for how low cloud cover is actually increased and decreased by cosmic ray density incident upon the Earth. If you don't understand the Physics behind these mechanisms yourself, you have no business spreading your evangelical beliefs beyond the confines of your own narrow mind.

There's nothing basic about the problem, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt" The physics describing the greenhouse effect, that we have know about since French physicist Joseph Fourier in 1824, is indeed basic physics that today we understand very well. The difficult is in terms of short term prediction, extent of warming, time frames for worst case scenarios etc. The details in other words. "If you think you know what you're talking about, give a concise explanation of the mechanism by which CO2 causes global warming." Why concise? The definition of BASIC is: "The essential facts or principles of a subject" Those facts aren't necessarily concise in written form. One of the primary factors is the water vapour positive feedback loop. You see, CO2 isn't the most powerful greenhouse gas, water vapour is. But when mankind releases CO2 into the atmosphere, the atmosphere warms to a degree. That small degree of warming causes greater evaporation and given that water vapour is the most potent greenhouse gas the temperature rises further. As the temperature rises further, locked up CO2 from places like, for example, permafrost is released and worst still methane. So the temperature rises again, so more evaporation and the cycle continues. The water vapour positive feedback loop is a very important factor. And why just a few parts per million of CO2 is such an issue. In terms of the greenhouse effect itself, It's how energy interacts with the atmosphere. Sunlight enters the atmosphere as ultraviolet and visible light, some of this solar energy is then radiated back toward space as infrared energy, or heat. The atmosphere is 78 percent nitrogen and 21 percent oxygen, which are both gases made up of molecules containing two atoms. These tightly bound pairs don't absorb much heat.

The other worry is that temperature alone does not tell us what we need to worry about. Is there actual evidence of more extreme climate events?

In the real world, it's accepted as high quality science by every major science organisation on the planet. You can look at the websites of every national and international science organisation in the world – every scientific specialism, in every country, every culture, every political leaning – and not one disputes the basic scientific facts that the climate is heating, it is serious, it is human-caused and it requires urgent action. Because scientists all over the world know how to study the planet they live on, and they know how to evaluate scientific research. It's called competence.

They use natural recorders of climate variability such as tree rings, ice cores, fossil pollen, ocean sediments, corals and historical data. The "adjustments" you refer to in regard to tree ring data, aren't a guess, they are based on a well tested algorithm. The reason data correction takes place for SOME tree ring data is because tree ring data in some high altitude locations doesn't accurately follow atmospheric temperature. This variable has to be accounted for with an effective algorithm. If climate scientists didn't do this then the results would be wrong. Its a well understood method of accounting for inaccuracies in SOME tree ring data. But again, climatologists have lots of other proxy data to back up the tree ring data. "the predictive capability of climate models" Its the LONG TERM climate models that are the most important, as a long term global average temp. And in this respect the models have been shown to be pretty accurate. https://skepticalscience.com/climate-models.htm	UCf9OPsS0o4ePBlUaMeRq6-g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf9OPsS0o4ePBlUaMeRq6-g	1	UgydFrDcqrTII6jOcsJ4AaABAg	Mike Jack

Highly disturbing as well is the series of emails that shows how Dr Jones and his colleagues have for years been discussing the devious tactics whereby they could avoid releasing their data to outsiders under freedom of information laws. The latter behavior is further evidence that badly colors the fundamental motivations of these researchers.

Without it, can&#39;t help but be a little skeptical. For example, the news says things like deforestation in Europe contributes to global warming (less trees so less CO2 sequestration) , but a crude analysis suggests the opposite, i.e., replacing forests with concrete or sand increases the Earth&#39;s albedo, and the resulting cooling more than offsets the warming from the lost CO2 absorption. I am not saying this crude analysis is not overlooking something, and of course I am not in favor of any deforestation whatsoever. It is just an example of the need to see their math.

The exponential increase in solar photovoltaic electricity production, currently at a doubling time of 2.4 years, along with contributions from wind and nuclear power, with NO subsidies necessary due to the &quot;Moore&#39;s&quot; law type of price reductions, it is overwhelmingly likely that the problem of CO2 emissions affecting the climate, will simply be solved by market economics by 2040, or 2050 at the latest. While business as usual climate prediction is a science problem, the growth of such technologies like solar is an economic problem, one which has now begun to follow an exponential growth curve, almost making any fixed target for energy production, reachable within 30 years. <br /><br />It&#39;s the failure by the activist groups to understand economics which is causing the hysteria, and their pressure on governments to intervene, is the greatest threat to solving the problem.

You seem to know how to ask the right questions in other scenarios.<br />Notice that Palmer started off by saying the the model predictions have been very accurate. What???!!!. How could you not ask him to give an example of a prediction the models made that actually happened. Unless something has changed recently, whenever the modelers were asked about this they tried to escape by saying the models only predicted climate DECADES ahead (i.e. they didn&#39;t due weather prediction stuff) <br />Well, this escape clause caused a problem. As you know, physical science is time invariant. The laws that apply and determine the future are the same laws that apply and did determine the past. There was NO climate model that predicted the Medieval Warm Period which took place several hundred years ago. That is why some of the Climategate emails said &quot;We have to get rid of the Medieval Warm Period.&quot; They had to get rid of it because their models couldn&#39;t predict its existence. If the models can&#39;t predict the past they can&#39;t predict the future.<br /><br /><br />Climate has worked in repeating cycles over the last several thousand years. Before the Medieval Warm Period there was the Roman Warm Period. [both of these were without industrial levels of CO2] It was because of this higher temperature that Hannibal was able to take his elephants through the Alps to attack Rome. If he had tried to do this during the Maunder Minimum (circa 1650 AD) ago he would not have been able to get them into the Alps let alone through the Alps.<br /><br /><br />You also missed an important slip in the logic of Palmer&#39;s explanation of how the models work. He explicitly says that CO2 raises global temperature and by implication that means the models are programmed to predict a temperature rise; especially considering the models are parameterized to assume rising atmospheric CO2. That CO2 on a global scale raises temperature is not proved. In fact, analysis of ice core samples from the Antarctic which go back hundreds of thousands of years show that during that range the global temperature rises and then about 300 years LATER the CO2 levels in the atmosphere go up. CO2 rise follows global temperature rise not vice versa. Why didn&#39;t Palmer himself bring this issue up. Intellectual honesty on his part requires him to broach the topic.<br /> <br />You need to talk to Tony Heller about how accurate the the models are. Heller has a YouTube channel where he produces several revelatory videos on how fraud is being created by the so-called climate scientists. He is not a conspiracy theorist. He has been an advisor on this topic to state governments in America and Australia. I&#39;m not saying Professor Palmer is one of those whom Heller considers a fraud; but, I am suspicious of how he answered your questions.<br /><br /><br />Anyway, Heller has the real data, he has the newspaper clippings and national weather readouts that show that the 1930&#39;s were the hottest times ever. All the nonsense about each succeeding year (nowadays) being the hottest ever is just science fiction. Heller also has articles from the 1970s when major science magazines were saying that a new ice age was imminent. That is more likely to be our climatological direction. Right now, in Toronto we have had major snowfall in early November. I can&#39;t remember the last time this happened. As Heller shows in his videos there are several states in America that are currently going through major snowfall pretty much a month earlier than usual. Did Palmer&#39;s models predict these phenomena? I don&#39;t think so.<br /><br /><br />Horrendous math error in the first graph shown to you. You NEVER average out the temperatures produced by various models. That is a NO-NO. The result is meaningless. You should have caught that or at least commented on it.<br /><br /><br /> Think about that graph for a moment. In the 1970s climate scientists were predicting an impending ice age BUT the chart you were shown indicated that the temperature had been going up since 1960. Something wrong here. I think the answer is that you are looking at fudged data. Data created recently and by people who don&#39;t know their history and are unaware of the Ice Age scare of the 1970s. Anyway, Tony Heller has produced several videos on this problem. He has also shown that NASA is changing its own previously published temperature data because the old data doesn&#39;t accord with the trends NASA is trying to show for the future. Worse, NASA is starting to use the temperatures computed by its models as if they were real thermometer determined temperatures. This is another NO-NO. Obviously, you compare the model temperatures with the real ones measured by thermometer to see if the models work. This may explain Professor Palmer&#39;s ludicrous claim that the models are predicting accurately. They are predicting accurately their own output not the temperatures actually occurring in Nature.<br /><br /><br />Anyway, contact Tony Heller his Internet site link is <a href="https://realclimatescience.com/">https://realclimatescience.com</a> I&#39;m sure he will provide you with more than enough data to show the fraud that is going on.

I agree with you but keep in mind sometimes the data comes from newspaper clippings and when it does it should be used. As an example we are told that this year or last year was the hottest on record but historical records (newspaper clippings and government reports from the time) say otherwise. In fact the 1930s were the hottest on record as Heller's data shows. I'm old enough to well remember what went on in the 1970s and how scientist were claiming an impending Ice Age was on the way. That was the mantra of the climate alarmists mantra back then. It was also said that there was a consensus on the issue. It was a fact! Same as now when it is said that A.G.W. is a fact! So did some new bit of physics get discovered to change things. No, but something new got in the mix. Governments wanted a way of increasing revenues something that people would not resist. They got it in the climate scare over CO2. Now they can tax businesses and individuals based on their 'carbon footprint' and no one complains because they believe they are 'saving' the planet. There is a reason there is no debate (there never was one): the warming side (science and government both) has too much to lose if they are shown to be wrong. Also, it is not a case of proving everyone wrong. I suspect you may be thinking of the so-called consensus on warming (97%). If so, that figure is a fiction. There never has been a mechanism to determine such a number. The link below is to a paper written on the origin of the 97% consensus and why the number is bogus. https://www.thegwpf.org/content/uploads/2014/09/Warming-consensus-and-it-critics1.pdf Lest you think that this paper was produced by some crackpot organization, if you look at the members of the Academic Advisory Council members listed you will see the names Professor Richard Lindzen, Professor Freeman Dyson, and Professor William Happer. All three are internationally recognized at being at the top level in their fields. So, yes, you are definitely right in what you say and the only way to overturn this is through science. That requires debate and publication. The A.G.W. side has never been willing to debate and if you know anything about the Climategate scandal you will know that there was an effort underway to prevent peer reviewed publication of any articles that took an opposing view to A.G.W. Which brings us back to Tony Heller. One of his friends and 'mentors' was the guy who created method of predicting Hurricanes. According to Heller, every year this guy got his funding for new climate research. Al Gore invited him to speak at one of his conferences. This guy said he would come but he was of the opposing view at which point he was disinvited and he never received another government grant for his research. There is something going on O.N. and it won't allow for a proper scientific approach. There's too much money involved. You don't get government grants by claiming 'the sky isn't falling.'

I feel sorry for you because all you will ever be suited to do is flip burgers or act as a barista. You really should sue the university or college that educated you. I'm sure you spent a lot of time and money getting an education that is useless. Its unfortunate. There was a time when higher education taught students how to argue and debate. You can't even come up with a simple counter argument. Claiming Heller is not a scientist when he has worked doing research for one of the most prestigious labs in the world is a complete brain fart on your part. Fortunately, nobody on the planet who is a scientist has to get your authorization to be called that. By the way, if Heller is making unscientific claims shouldn't it be easy for you to prove that? "He's not a scientist" is not a counter. It is a logical fallacy called "Truth by Declaration" meaning something is true because you say it is true. Worthless. The same for "What he does isn't scientific . . ." You obviously were too simple-minded to understand what I was telling you in my discussion of Einstein and Darwin. First, Eddington was an astrophysicist and by definition he was a scientist. When he photographed the stars near the Sun in 1919 he was doing science. In this case, he was doing what Einstein suggested to disprove his theory. When Tony Heller, who is degreed in science (at least twice) photographs proof that the ice caps are not melting away, he is doing science. He is proving that the climate models that predict the melting are wrong. He is disproving the predictions made by the models or those using the models. Models are based on theory. Once there is a counter to the theory that theory is disproved entirely. That was Einstein's point about disproving Relativity. He predictions had be be EXACT or the entire theory was wrong. By the way, did you find anything that shows Professor Palmer has proved that he is a competent 'climatologist'? He should have been involved is refuting several predictions made by other climatologists over the decades that have long since been shown to be overtly wrong. So far, I haven't found anything along these lines. At the same time, I have yet to see anything to prove the claims made by Tony Heller are wrong. So, for the moment I will listen to what Heller has to say on Global Warming before I listen to Palmer. Please learn what science is and please learn how to frame a counter argument if you are going to continue with this. Oh, and have a look at The Fallacy Files site (link below) it contains just about every logical fallacy perpetrated during debate (usually by those on the left). https://www.fallacyfiles.org I don't think I need to come up for air just yet but you are definitely in way over your head.

When 'competent people' were claiming that the North Polar ice cap was disappearing he provided the evidence that they not only were'n't disappearing but were growing. As he showed in one of his videos: some Nordic idiot believing in the 'competent people' as you put it tried to kayak through the North Pole and had to turn back after going a little more than 20 miles as the North Polar ice cap was far too intact to allow him passage. Funny how that happens when you listen to the 'competent people.' Heller also has an interesting video on the research vessel that decided to study the melting South Polar ice cap and got iced in because the ice wasn't melting. The rescue ship sent to retrieve the researchers had to turn back (too much ice). Funny how that happens when you listen to 'competent people. I assume, for some unknown reason that you think that Prof. Palmer is one of these competent people. So, can you find me an example of his competence. For example, when Al Gore predicted the North Polar ice cap would be gone by 2012 did Prof. Palmer come out and say, "Wrong Al, won't happen"? When others (including Gore) predicted that the Maldive Islands would be under water by 2018 (predictions started around 1988) did Prof. Palmer say publicly "Ain't gonna happen"? Do you have anything to show he is competent (other than Sabine Hossenfelder sought him out)? No, I don't think actual scientists should stop doing actual science but the alarmists don't come across as scientists or as people doing actual scientific work. If they ever make a prediction that actually happens I may concede that they are but until then absolutely not. Many are snake oil salesmen at best. I think they should listen to Heller and if necessary debate him on the topic; but, they won't and with good reason they know they would lose. This guy comes loaded for bear and he takes no bear as prisoner. By the way, that is how science is supposed to work. Someone proposes a theory. Others now try to disprove it. The process behind Science is about disproving a theory not proving it. Any single disproof is enough to invalidate the entire theory. When a real scientist proposes a theory, he provides information on how that theory may be disproved. For example, Einstein in his publication of Special Relativity made it clear that stars in the vicinity of the Sun's image would not appear in their expected position due to the bending of Space Time by the Sun's gravity. If the stars did not appear EXACTLY where Special Relativity predicted them to be then his theory would be wrong and he would have to go back to the drawing board. Arthur Eddington did real science and yet all he did was take photographs (kinda like Tony Heller does) of the solar eclipse of 1919. The stars that could be made out in the photograph were where Relativity predicted so the first support of the theory had been found (i.e. it had not been disproved) . Similarly, when Charles Darwin proposed his Theory on the Origin of Species he made it clear that it had a problem that would have to be dealt with eventually; specifically, the Cambrian Explosion. He recognized as a legitimate counter to his theory the apparent springing into existence of complex animals in a relatively short period of time. That was a problem because evolution was a very slow process. Darwin supposed that an incomplete fossil record may be at fault for this inconsistency with his his theory. That may be the case; but, to date, no one has shown that the fossil record prior to the Cambrian is so incomplete that the precursors needed to prove continuity of complex life are 'lost to time'. Now, with the CO2 theory of Earth's temperature; can you cite the paper that proves this as a fact. Remember, such a paper would have to provide possible counters to such a theory. I've definitely tried finding such a paper but it doesn't seem to exist. As I mentioned to Sabine Hossenfelder; the core examples show that CO2 elevations come after temperature rises not before. It's not just Tony Heller who has made a point about this just about every scientist I've heard talking about the issue points this out. All in all Tony Heller is closer to a real scientist than the guys you think of as 'competent people'. By the way, Tony Heller is a trained scientist. He has a Bachelor's of Science in Geology and a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering. Oh, he's also worked as a scientist with the following credentials: Geothermal research at Los Alamos National Labs Oil shale research at Los Alamos National Labs Thermodynamic research of methane hydrates at Los Alamos National Labs Volcano research at Los Alamos National Labs So, a wingnut he isn't. A populist he isn't. A scientist he is and I guess that's why his videos sound 'sciencey' to anyone who understand science.

Sabine is usually good at avoiding this, a rare talent. The scientist will tend to emphasize the inaccuracies and limitations of his methods, whereas the skeptic will cherry-pick the factors that reinforce his pre-conceived notions.

The public is easily fooled by sciencey sounding rhetoric. Environmentalism has replaced traditional religion. Global warming was created by the UN in 1988. They will never stipulate a null hypothesis. The fact is that there is zero reproducible experimental evidence that CO2 has much of any net effect on the temperature of the atmosphere. Most of these climate frauds are very careful not to be caught in a situation where they can be asked the questions that real scientists are suppose to answer. I think it is only because Sabine and this guy are friends that he thought he'd be safe. He kind of miscalculated. But actually Sabine is not asking any really tough questions.

Meanwhile, the warming trend has much to do with wood burning and single stroke engines. So, there is much technology to advance both cooking and transportation in the developing world, as well as cleaning up the coal fired power plants being built, the majority of which will be in China and India. Freeman Dyson recommends engineering plants, esp. crops for bigger root systems to sequester carbon in the ground. He also said that if the United States would increase it's top soil by 1%...or was it 2%, memory fails me...that would offset the carbon production of the Chinese increase in carbon emission.

Yes, solar has become cheap but its taken 50 years for that to become true, maybe more (Einstein's Photovoltaic paper was 1905?), but it took until the 1950's for the precursors of that physics be applied, followed by the cost-insensitive NASA to pay for solar cell development, California taxpayer support in the 1980's for commercial investments, China investment to mass manufacturing of solar cells.

The whole of science has never been more accessible or more transparent, including climate science. You have access to presentations by the world's best scientists at the top of their game, all at the touch of a button. Pretty much every scientific organisation has web pages explaining it so clearly they can be used for primary school children. Wikipedia has pages on it with hundreds of links to quality journalism and research. NASA has an excellent site that guides you through the evidence. Science youtube channels like sixtysymbols, veritasium, minutephysics, seeker, ... all have great explainers on climate change. Every reputable popular science journal (Nature, Scientific American, Science, New Scientist, ...) does specials on it every few months. Most newspapers cover it regularly and responsibly (with notable exceptions of course). There are some excellent science journalists who spend most of their time trying to convey the magnitude of this thing, and the reasoning behind it. Scientists aren't born communicators, and most don't take up the job in order to present their work to the public, they're investigators and measurement-takers and fact-finders and fact-checkers. Recently, hundreds of actual climate scientists have stepped up to try to communicate this stuff, and some have done it brilliantly, *despite* many of them getting no funding for it from their institutions, and despite how much time it takes, and despite the continual attacks and threats it exposes them to from lunatics on social media. Scientists aren't politicians. It's not their responsibility to try to change your mind. It's yours. It's all out there. When you're ready for it, it'll still be there.

Global mean sea levels are rising at an accelerating rate, now around 5mm per year. Both of these are essentially 100% attributable to greenhouse gas emissions from human activity, with the main contributor (about 65%) being CO2 emissions now totalling more than 2 trillion tons. Sea ice, ice caps and glaciers worldwide are melting at exceptional rates. Despite the huge amount of energy being used to melt ice at the poles, temperatures in the Arctic and the Antarctic are increasing twice as fast as in the equator. The reduction in temperature gradient weakens the jet stream leading to blocking patterns in temperate latitudes, making extreme weather more prolonged. The increase in temperature of tropical seas increases the maximum power of cyclones. Increases in prolonged hot dry weather increases the incidence of forest fires and intensifies water shortages. Agricultural land is lost to salt-water incursion and drought. A reduction in the stability of weather patterns and increase in extremes increases the risk of crop loss. Higher temperatures increases the capacity of the air to hold water vapour, which increases the intensity of extreme rain events, intensifying soil erosion. I haven't even mentioned the effect on vulnerable societies through loss of reliable harvests, desertification, land loss to floods, spread of tropical diseases. When famine strikes a community, they have three choices: sit and suffer, fight, or move and they never choose the first one. I haven't even mentioned biodiversity loss and all the knock-on effects of that. They're all interconnected. This is pretty much all mainstream science now, even if I've butchered some of the details because I'm not pretending to write a climate science paper. The more Greenland ice melts, the lower the sea level around Greenland gets. That's a strange one. You can test that. Do you need any more? The higher the CO2 levels in the air, the lower the nutritional content of some crops. Some plants do respond positively in growth rate with higher CO2 concentrations, all else being equal, but given that climate change is predicted to bring more droughts, more floods, higher likelihood of loss of pollinators, higher likelihood of invasion by pests, higher chances of heat waves and less stable seasonal cycles for farmers to work with, the net effect on crops worldwide is pretty much guaranteed to be negative. Barring a worldwide agricultural genetics revolution. You can test that. It's so much easier to brush aside than to understand. I met hundreds of schoolchildren at a climate event today. They get it. They're going to have to.	UC-Xz0kbedHc6JV9BkSRpbrg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-Xz0kbedHc6JV9BkSRpbrg	1	UgwG5lwv-xjgAS99d6Z4AaABAg	Hank Snow

So, all models have assumptions, approximations, and, indeed, errors (or residuals) and are thus imperfect. Some models are better at forecasting (or producing forecasts that are reasonably close to observed future value), but this is often because they are modelling simpler phenomena. Hard science models can often produce good forecasts, for example car crash dynamics can produce results close to what is modelled, similarly for laboratory chemical reactions...( add chemical X to chemical Y, under controlled conditions and the result is pretty easy to forecast and reproduce.) On the other hand, social science models have horrible predictive power. This is especially true for subjects such as economics, whose models have about as much predictive power as a circus fortune teller. (Mainly because they rely so heavily on human behaviour or interactions with the systems being studied.)

The key point here being that the fundamental driver of CO2 concentrations is economic activity. The solution to the CO2 problem can never be solved by regulation, it can be solved by the exponential growth in technology such as photovoltatics which is currently following a "Moore's law" doubling every 2.4 years. Within less than 5 years, some say far sooner, the cost of solar electricity, will become the first the cheapest form of power, when the cost of new fossil power stations are included over the life cycle, and soon after, the cheapest, on a day to day basis, rendering a fossil fuel power station a loss making activity. Problem solved - the only thing that can go wrong, is a misguided effort to interfere with the market.

It seemed unreal and totally inconsistent to me. I don&#39;t want to say I was a visionary, the only thing I try to say is that we even don&#39;t need supercomputers to figure out climate models. A decent amount of common sense is sufficient.

Fossil fuel are organic materials that have been compressed over many millennia. There are only three type coal, oil, and natural gas. Coal come in layers like sedimentary rock deep in the earth, or as an outcrop underneath the earth surface. Oil primarily comes from aquifers. The largest oil aquifer in the world had been in the Arabian peninsula. Natural gas also comes from aquifers, and also between layers of sedimentary rock. A mechanical/chemical process called fracking removes the natural gas from the rock in mini substations, where it is fed into a refinery for processing. All fossil fuels have a burning capacity and are measured in terms of octane ratings and BTU, and need oxygen and fire source to burn. In the case of a coal fired power plant coal is burned with oxygen, giving of pollutants measurable polltants like Carbon Monoxide, Nitrous Oxides, Sulphur Dioxide. Until recently Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide were reported as percentage ratio. How since the revival of the climate change movement, carbon dioxide has been under severe scruitiny as the pollutant that is the major culprit of global warming. Suggesting, burning down fossil fuels would somehow advance technologies so that alternative energies would be adequate in the future is not a very well thought up idea. Climate change has now well documented effects that include loss of land use effecting crops, rising sea levels and flooding in low lying densely populated areas, more frequent level 4 hurricanes, cyclones, drought conditions causing forest fires and severe shortages of drinking water, increased population migrations and famine, destruction of wetlands with loss of species habitats, enormous loss of biodiversity, and maybe even war. I think cognitive computing like artificial intelligence will only exacerbate the future of a climate change threatened world.

When a billion refugees start knocking at Europe and US doorstep. There will be no consensus at that time even. There will be a blame game and war. People with wealth will scramble to save what theirs. Deniers will continue blaming geoengineering. Like a self fulfilling prophecy GE with horrible side effects will be finally implemented by desperate governments. Finally war on Russia which will hold most of the habitable land, will brake out at some pretext.

What if the higher carbon dioxide levels we are now producing are the key to returning to that previous temperature and the inevitable devolution of all species back to only those that can survive in higher temperatures?

Industrial exploitation of dense hydrocarbons has happened for 200 years (0.1%) of the total human evolution. It would be very arrogant to think that we will find out how to fix climate change before it kills many of us. Over the past 2000 years the human existence has involved many famines and resource driven genocides the next 50 years is likley to be no different. The way I see it we are just another organism that has outgrown its environment. When most of the human race has died nature will take over again and some humans may survive but we will take many species with us that have no ability to migrate or evolve to deal with the higher temperatures. We are not smart enough to stop the oil and gas lobby from wringing every last drop of profit out of the ground and even if we were, we would still not get developing countries to halt their growth and use of cheap hydrocarbons to achieve that growth. Unless there is international consensus on action we may as well just get on with enjoying the time we have.

Or that within five years, the price of solar cells and storage, will mean that it will be cheaper to shut down existing fossil fuel power stations and build a solar power station instead? Or that by 2040, over 50% of world electricity will be from solar power? By 2050, fossil fuels will be less that 10% of World energy production and the biosphere will begin to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. Do you know why this will happen? Because of the greedy, exploitative, capitalist system, that has given you your iPhone and the ability to communicate with anyone on the planet. Look at history, every new technology has grown slowly, then faster and faster, then cheaper and cheaper, your iPhone/Android has more computing power than a supercomputer from the 1980’s. Once the process has begun, faster, cheaper, more efficient, it becomes self sustaining, until the technology matures and a new idea is found and it starts again. All this will happen due to economic incentives, without any measures by governments, simply because the market is far bette at finding the best solution, rather than a political process. It’s already happening, the very people who fear the future, are the same people who condemn the system which will save the planet - because the know nothing about economics. https://www.powermag.com/iea-world-energy-outlook-solar-capacity-surges-past-coal-and-gas-by-2040 . And by the way, twenty years ago I worked at the same research centre as Tim Palmer, he is a brilliant scientist and I endorse everything that he says. I am not “a denier”, Prof Palmer is doing good scientific research, it is just not part of his job to analyse the effects of technological change, and how it will very likely solve this and many other problems. The biggest problem facing the world today is the predatory activities of the US, UK and their allies. Regime change wars, withdrawal from nuclear agreements, refusal to sign bio weapon conventions, any of this madness could end life on earth long before the globe overheats. The largest supercomputers today, are not being used to model climate change, they are at the US Department of Energy facility at Oak Ridge - being used to simulate and design the next generation of nuclear weapons. Where is the anti-war left? Watching Janes Clapper on MSNBC saying” it’s in the Russian DNA to lie and cheat” hero worshipping the CIA, using racial abuse on twitter calling any dissenter “A Russian troll/bot/stooge” , in my opinion this is a far greater risk than climate change. The few on the left who tell the truth are mercilessly attacked by their own side. By either promoting Russophobia, or preaching climate catastrophe, or attempting to redefine our language, how is this making the world a better place and promoting peace?

The amount of tree has recovered in the Northen hemisphere (read: developed countries stop cutting down trees): https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/08/planet-earth-has-more-trees-than-it-did-35-years-ago/ Yes, we should find a way to better energy source to replace fossil fuel because by definition it will run out, solar and wind have not been very effective so far and need much more improvement, nuclear energy is a good solution yet it is being hunted down by "activists" for irrational fear. Also as shown above, we need the developing countries to develop so they can stop cutting down trees, the problem is to do this they will either have to burn a lot of fossil fuel (like we did in the past) or have access to a new source of energy that is better and cheaper than fossil fuel, we have yet to make solar and wind to even work at developed countries so far (again, nuclear energy might be a solution but a lot of those countries are politically unstable and giving them access to nuclear power can be a concern).

They are an extremely dense form of energy, with a very low entropy, which is a compressed form of solar energy. This gives it the property of having a very high "Gibbs Free Energy", a thermodynamic term for the ability to do "work" at a very high efficiency, the low entropy is the "fuel" for an exponential growth of information in a technological society. You want to know what "burning it down" will do? It will accelerate technology, industry, information, ideas, and science and allow us to develop efficient solar technologies so that the problem will go away, within 20-30 years.

Interesting how in 1815 a volcano exploded which was 150 times that of Mt. St. Helens. It was equivalent to over 60 Hiroshima sized atom bombs. In Indonesia, a large mountain named "Tambora" exploded and killed over 300,000 people. Its effects lasted over two years. The Global temperature cooled by 1.5 degrees (F). Most crops in Europe didn't grow for a year and a half. Thirty-six (36) "cubic miles" or about 100 megatons of sulfur and smoke and grit encircled the Earth. There was no spring season and the summer never warmed. The following year, 1816 became known as "The Year Without Summer". There was a famine in Ireland. In New England, the year became known as "1800 and froze to death". Morning frost would last until June and almost no planted seed would grow. Livestock died. However, the 19th century was already known as "a little ice age". But after the "Tambora Event" was over after two years, the Earth's "natural thermostat" took over. Eventually, precipitation brought the smoke and dust to the ground. The "stuff" eventually went to the bottom of the ocean which eventually gets recycled into the plates and digested inside the molten magma beneath the ocean. So what do we do? Do we spend trillions and trillions of dollars to reduce carbon emissions only to have another large volcano or a huge rock suddenly fall from space and start all over again?

Back of the envelop guestimate from my armchair here: the Earth has a surface of roughly half a billion km², times 100 for the vertical resolution (?) so I guess the simulation needs about 50 billion nodes. Can we cram all of the state needed for a single node in 100 bytes? Then that would be 5 terabytes of state for one snapshot of the whole simulation. Which I guess all needs to be loaded into GPUs for massively parallel computation. A modern Nvidia Tesla type GPU might come with 16GB, so a naive division suggests about 300 GPU cards could handle this. Call it a thousand for a round number. And then of course tons of motherboards, power supplies, disk space, networking and custom software to shovel all that data around. Would be pretty interesting to work on something like that!

Given that 8 million years ago, hominoid-like creatures started to appear, it might be wise to cover at least that much time. Not so much to determine how much influence hominoid beings had on the Earth, but rather to have a better, larger data sample since Earth&#39;s climate may have been somewhat similar for far grander periods of time back as far as maybe 50 million years ago.

Headlines and articles typically contain emotional loaded language that favors the right such as this Wrong Again: 50 Years of Failed Eco-pocalyptic Predictions. This story comes from the questionable climate change denial website RealClimateScience. When not promoting climate change pseudoscience, they advocate for Libertarian positions such as small government and property rights. Editorially, the primary purpose of the CEI is to mislead on climate change. They have been criticized by scientist for publishing misleading information such as this: Scientist to CEI: You Used My Research To “Confuse and Mislead”. According to Ballotpedia the “CEI believes that scientific consensus on climate change and global warming were politically rather than scientifically motivated.” Finally, the CEI has a long history of lobbying for the tobacco industry and since 2011 has advocated for the e-cigarette industry. Overall, we rate the Competitive Enterprise Institute Questionable based on far right bias, promotion of propaganda, use of poor sources, lack of transparency with funding, and a general rejection of scientific consensus. (D. Van Zandt 7/12/2016) Updated (9/21/2019)" In other words, it's far-right denialist horseshit funded by oil companies, the Koch bros., and the like. There's no point in my even bothering to check the vids linked to. You can go ahead and try and get through to one of these people, but I'm a retired Chemist, and being old, do not have time to waste on these scientifically illiterate assclowns.

That's like trying to model turbulent flow in half of a water pipe. But, Ken, they just cannot grasp the complexities, let alone think their way through a propaganda piece to uncover the faulty methodology, cherry-picking, inclusion of irrelevant data, and lack of peer review.

Here let me help you out: - Global warming: The persistent long term warming of the planet that we've been measuring for over a century. Long term is key. Anything driving global warming has to work on the time scale of at least 100 years. - Earth tilting: The sun typically hits the earth at different strengths depending on latitude and time of year. See that last word..."year". This effect changes the temperature over the time frame of a single year. You just described how we get the seasons of a year and that has *NOTHING* to do with the current global warming. Nobody is saying there is global warming because the summer is warmer than the winter. - Solar cycle: Ok you are getting a bit better with the time frame. The sun has a solar cycle of 11 years on average, but you've got two problem trying to link that to global warming. First is that there have been roughly 10 complete solar cycles since we've seen the start of global warming. If the sun caused the warming, the temperature would keep resetting back to the baseline every time a new solar cycle started. That doesn't happen. The temperatures just keep going up. Second is that the most recent sun cycle was coming to the end last year, and it was a pretty weak one even at its height. If the sun activity was the main factor for temperatures changes, temperatures should have been cooling, but we keep setting records for warmth. See link for chart of solar cycle. https://en.es-static.us/upl/2018/12/Sunspot-activity-observation-dec6-e1544118001987.jpeg This last point is also majorly tripping you up. You say the planet will start heating up more in the future because we are currently at a minimum. Well yeah. But what does that have to do with all the record heating we've just been going through. The sun's activity is a huge danger signal because we've been getting these record highs AT THE SAME TIME the sun was reducing activity. When the sun starts increasing again it's going to be even worse. ====== As for your cherry picked articles, you just don't know how science works. It works by consensus. You will always be able to find fringe ideas. That is especially true if you go outside of peer reviewed articles.The key is what does the consensus of climate scientist says. For one thing, there was never a consensus for global cooling. That was just a small number of scientists who were trying to make the first climate models and overestimated how much aerosols would cool the planet versus how much CO2 would warm it. Even so, most scientific articles at the time still said CO2 was the driving factor and that temperature would rise. As always I come with the proof. Here it is in this article that I know you won't read: THE MYTH OF THE 1970s GLOBAL COOLING SCIENTIFIC CONSENSUS https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/2008BAMS2370.1 Oh and I've been saving this reply for just this occasion. You keep getting on your high horse that climate scientists have made mistakes in the past. Well guess what? Global warming deniers have a long history of making mistakes, and they all underestimate the amount of warming. They started out saying the earth was cooling, which is why I guess you seem to think it was, but even they had to come around and admit the earth was warming. I've been amused while you claimed the earth was cooling all the while knowing that even the people you were citing didn't believe that any more. I know your side better than you do. Here, take a read and weep. (Really just look at the graph at the bottom that shows the many changes the global warming deniers had to make) https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/may/11/more-errors-identified-in-contrarian-climate-scientists-temperature-estimates ====== Well alrighty then. See how it's done. You challenged me, and I met the challenge with answers and an references to back them up. (I knocked it out of the park if I say so myself) Meanwhile you are still diverting from answering the simple question: *How can the Arctic ice be melting at the same time that you insist that the earth was cooling?* As I mentioned to Timon Anderson, I now know you all are wasting my time. You never answer my question. All you do is divert and throw one global warming denial theory after another as I spend time knocking them down. I will no longer be doing that. From now on I will simply reply to you with my unanswered question that I've asked 6 times now, and call you out for not answering it.

Solar irradiance causes warming, and due to the the approaching solar activity minimum the temperature will change again, and will continue to do so as it has for billions of years.

It's main flaw is that it uses northern hemisphere data to make global analyses.

The reality is that while temperatures were falling in the northern hemisphere, they were rising in the southern hemisphere. That dynamic can't be captured in a single global temperature value for a year. This is documented by the study titled "Global Cooling?" by Paul E. Damon and Steven M.

You claim there is no extra heat, yet from 1978-2018 the Arctic Ocean lost 12.8% of its September ice per decade relative to the 1981-2010 average(1). Ice requires heat to melt. That extra heat has to exist. It is basic physics. Oh and btw, you were not just saying there was no man made extra heat (nice goal post moving there). You literally said "there has been a cooling over the last 20 years". That's the exact same time that the Arctic ice has been melting. To paraphrase the absurdity of your argument. You are trying to claim with a straight face that the ice cubes in your freezer not only started melting for no reason at all, but your freezer got colder while it happened. That's impossible. Unless you can break the laws of nature to explain how that is possible, your basic facts are so wrong it invalidates your entire argument. So I ask again. How do you explain that the Arctic ice melted while you claim the planet got cooler? Your entire credibility rests on answering that simple question you keep dodging. I will note that I had no problem shooting down your theory questioning how Antarctica gained ice during global warming. Yea, that was yet another theory you got wrong and conveniently dropped.

If CO2 in the atmosphere goes below 150ppm all life on earth will be no more. Since 1980s there has been a 14% increase in global greening, which is because plants are naturally historically adapted to much higher levels of CO2, and an increase to 3000ppm would have no discernable effect on global temperatures. It is obvious you are not going to move from your stance, and I won't either. Therefore, only time will prove one of us correct. However, there have been several "climate catastrophe" predictions over the past few decades, none of which have come to fruition, ie Al Gore said by 2007 vast areas of the US would be under water, but the date for such events is continually move, but it still hasn't happened. In this time numerous scientists have been sacked from their jobs, pressure brought to bare on institutions to remove anyone with skeptical views on global cooling, global warming, climate change and finally climate disruption - can you see the picture?? And all the time the bank balances of those that advocate the alarmist retoric increase, including Al Gore being the first carbon trading billionaire.

The Arctic melting is not only real but accelerating. There is clearly far less ice, and during the summer in recent years we nearly have an ice free Arctic Ocean. That's unprecedented.

NASA has to manipulate the data because the recording methods changed over time. I specifically called out the fact that in the past, temperatures in the US were typically taken in the afternoon which is hotter while more recent data was taken in the morning which is cooler. The older data had to be reduced to compensate for the face that it was taken at a different time of day. That was just one of the changes that had to be made. See the following links for more. https://climatefeedback.org/claimreview/nasa-did-not-create-global-warming-by-manipulating-data-tony-heller-steven-goddard/ https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/feb/08/no-climate-conspiracy-noaa-temperature-adjustments-bring-data-closer-to-pristine What is even more damning to the argument that the data was manipulated to show greater warming is that all the changes taken together actually reduced the magnitude global warming a bit, but deniers like to omit that point. They just like to focus in on the US data points that had the time of day adjustments to lower a subset of the temperatures, and ignore the data prior to 1940 that was actually increased in temperature.

It clearly shows global temperatures are rising, and after a brief slowdown in the early 2000s, have taken a steep incline to continue to break records. https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/ BOOM! 2) These record high temperatures aren't just a statistical curiosity. They are already altering the earth in major ways. See here how the Arctic ice is literally melting away. https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2510/see-how-arctic-sea-ice-is-losing-its-bulwark-against-warming-summers/ Any claim that global temperatures aren't rising are shot down by the simple fact that "Global climate change has already had observable effects on the environment. Glaciers have shrunk, ice on rivers and lakes is breaking up earlier, plant and animal ranges have shifted and trees are flowering sooner." https://climate.nasa.gov/effects/ You don't make major changes to the planet like that and not negatively impact human civilization.

You haven't discredited my argument. You've ignored it. You are trying to make points by arguing over which part of the Titanic will sink first. Just like the Titanic took on water and sank, the planet is warming and that warming is accelerating with dire consequences. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! 4) Your conspiracy theories have already been debunked. The graphs shown were deliberately manipulated to exaggerate the discrepancy and only deal with satellite data measurements that are inexact. Other types of data measurements are more inline with the models, but they were conveniently ignored. See here for a full analysis of the flaws in the graphs you provided. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVMsYXzmUYk http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2017/03/the-true-meaning-of-numbers/ http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2016/05/comparing-models-to-the-satellite-datasets/ 5) Your claim that US historical temperature data was manipulated...well that is actually true, but not how you think. Temperature data has not always been recorded in a constant way. Climate scientist have to adjust the data so older measurements are measuring like-for-like with newer ones. One of the bigger discrepancies with US data was that in the past temperatures were typically measured in the afternoon which is hotter, while newer measurements were made in the morning which is colder. Those older measurements were adjusted down to reflect this. That's not a conspiracy. That's science. That was just one of the adjustments that was made. Here is a more complete description of the changes made, and how they were verified to be correct. https://climatefeedback.org/claimreview/nasa-did-not-create-global-warming-by-manipulating-data-tony-heller-steven-goddard/ https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/feb/08/no-climate-conspiracy-noaa-temperature-adjustments-bring-data-closer-to-pristine BOOM!!!

The odds of adding that much energy to a system and getting a neutral or better result is vanishingly small.

But I thought he was utterly terrible - dishonest, irrational, unscientific, and generally full of shit. While he seems like a nice fellow, with people like him in the professional position he is in, it is no wonder that Climate Change is an utterly corrupted, politicized and dishonest "science". In what other field of science do key scientists refuse to show people both their  raw data and their "crunched" numbers? Usually a scientist will talk about his data, his theories, his experiments and his conclusions until the listener is blue in the face, and wants to flee the room! But not in climate science. In what other field of science are everybody's official, documented predictions so very wrong, year after year, and the predicters still stand by their models, theories and beliefs? You might recall that it was loudly declared worldwide that by July of 2015, all of greater New York City would permanently be submerged under 20 feet of seawater, and there would be absolutely no ice at or near the North Pole, year round, in perpetuity. Also, all of the Maldives Islands, Venice, and Bangladesh would disappear forever. And much of Holland would be permanently destroyed/submerged. And the number and severity of tornadoes and hurricanes would go up off the charts, for at least a century. Many, many other similar predictions were made, some with definite completion dates. Well, NOT ONE single prediction came true, or came anywhere close to coming true. Climate science is absolutely not a science, and Tim Palmer is nowhere close to being a scientist.

They last for usually 100,000 years and are interrupted by relatively short Interglazial periods of around 20,000 years. Given this situation the thought of higher temperatures being a threat seems absurd.<br />Then he added the ridiculous statement that we do not know, if the human body can withstand such temperatures and humidity. From that moment on the interview ceased to be scientific. The human body can easily withstand humidity of 90% or 100%. And the estimated rise of the average global temperature is minimal compared to seasonal changes in temperatures. So what did he try to say with this statement? The unprotected human body does not even withstand the current global average temperature of 15 degrees centigrade. This is why we wear clothes. This is a totally irrelevant statement.

I dug into what "hide the decline" was, saw Phil Jones conspiring to delete email, and saying he'd rather delete data than give it to climate skeptics via a freedom of information request. Tony Heller goes over data and articles. Science is corruptible. You can ad hominem and appeal to authority all you like, but that's not a valid argument.

The most important greenhouse effect gaz is water (H2O). Now water has just the ideal concentration in the atmosphere, it keeps the ideal temperature and never change.

You don't even address the obvious counter argument that it is the other way round, global warming cause CO2 emission from the oceans and through the development of micro-organisms. You assume that global warming is caused by human activity, it is circular reasoning. The concentration in H2O can change for another reason than human activity or global warming, there is no plausible reason why it should remain constant while everything else changes.

Its increase is caused by burning fossil fuel. The other green house gases like methane and water vapor are the result of ocean heating which increases the amount of water vapor, and also releases sequestered methane within the oceans (and also the melting permafrost). Humans are not releasing water vapor, it’s Co2. It’s a positive feedback loop.

They use laws of thermodynamics and differential equations and parametrized guesses and apply them to a chaotic systems. The fundamental law of a chaotic system is that the past really has very large but unpredictable influence on the future!!! So much so that you cannot correlate past and future... Therefore these models gave no predictive power whatsoever. It hets worse. <br />The basic assumption of these models is that CO2 is a greenhouse gas. Where is the proof of that? Water is the greenhouse gas not because it absorbs the infrared radiation. It is greenhouse gas because as it follows the laws of thermodynamics and warms up, its specific weight decreases and therefore moves upward. But while this is happening, water vapor undergoes phase change, fog and clouds are formed in a rather nonlinear fashion, and trap the heat in the troposphere!!! CO2 does not behaved like that. It captures heat, than moves to higher layers of the atmosphere and carries the heat energy with it. High above the clouds it simply loses the heat and sinks back. This is actually an efficient way to COOL the atmosphere. It is much more efficient then just plain radiation: it is a heat pump!

If AGW is happening there should already be an acceleration in the long term slow linear rise in sea level but so far it seems the climate alarmists are struggling to find it and beginning to get a bit twitchy. Predictions by Al Gore and others form the 1980&#39;s are already miles off track.	UC-jPWEVlJ8EWo80pxUBXjYg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-jPWEVlJ8EWo80pxUBXjYg	0

Sea level data is far less ambiguous and anthropogenic warming has to show as an acceleration in the pre-existing linear rise. Without this acceleration it seems to me the climate models fail. It's 'odd' that this issue is not the main focus of attention in reporting of AGW evidence, arguments about weather are irrelevant. I'm not sure I made it clear enough that the increase in the rate of rise claimed in the study is over the entire duration of the 25 year observation period, NOT annually.

Unfortunately despite using extensive satellite altimetry to measure ocean surface height they then adjusted the data using climate models to attempt to correct for climatic patterns and volcanic effects so they are no longer working with empirical data. Effectively the models are being used to prove their own predictions. It doesn't take a genius to spot the flaw in this approach.

Question everything, but don't be afraid to learn, and don't be afraid to stop pretending to know more about science than scientists. CO2 followed temp when temp changed very slowly, at the end of each ice age cycle, because warming ocean water releases CO2. That made it even warmer, which released more CO2. How do we know that's not happening now? Because the CO2 content of the ocean is going up, not down. And because we're putting billions of tons of CO2 in the sky every year ourselves. And because it's warming hundreds of times faster than it ever did at the end of an ice age. And because we've known how CO2 traps radiative heat since the 1850s.

Every major scientific organisation on the planet, representing scientists from every part of the world, every culture, every political leaning, supports climate science and acknowledges that climate change is real, human-caused, serious and requires urgent action if we wish to maintain habitable conditions on Earth. If it were politics, organisations from different parts of the world would be disputing each others' work. Science progresses through argument, dissent, proving each other wrong, breaking through with new ideas. Universities and academies are in fierce competition. When the evidence is so overwhelming that competence demands that they agree, they agree. Most scientists have zero interest in politics. I'm a physicist. This stuff is *basic*.

What you wanted to say, is correlation does not imply causation, but that's not the same thing at all here. Model predictions is all about causality.... that's like the whole point, to understand causes.

In this graph, the black line is the actual climate data as best can be determined, and it says the temp has risen by about 0.4 of 1 degree C since 1980 when it was last at zero. So in 30 years, the time ris is 0.013 degrees C per decade, hardly cause for alarm. An this graph stops, conveniently in 2010, and if one notices, from about 1990 forward the black line flattens out, and continues being flat up to the present, which other more honest scientists include. And there is nothing in this graph which says anything whatsoever about causes, much less causes specifically attributable to human activity. <br /><br /><br />Sabine is terrific, this guy is trying hard to be PC compliant with the ideology, and in doing so he is sacrificing his scientific integrity and credibility.

Not checking your work is a poor show. I am not terrified by any increase, but if you think there's an acceptable rate of temp increase then what is that acceptable rate? Supply a number. If I drive a spike into your head is one millimetre a year progress into your skull acceptable to you? .... The true number from your calculation is 1.7C per century of AVERAGE EXTRA GLOBAL TEMP & HEAT ENERGY & I don't think you realise how much extra energy in the Earth atmosphere/oceans & seas that represents! And I don't think you realise how that extra energy will be expressed in real world natural events. An increase of 1.7C in a century will change everything & it will be hell for our children & grandchildren. For one thing you can expect nations fighting over water rights [already critical in some places] & you can expect human migrations on the order of 100,000,000 people [or perhaps in the billions] as agriculture is forced to track the new higher latitudes of optimal growing land. Wildlife & particularly vegetation cannot track such changes in such short intervals of time. Even rich nations will struggle to feed their populations - many people are going to die.

People don't read research directly from scientific journals, they don't have the time, scientific inclination or access (many are behind paywalls). Instead they watch news programs or read the news in papers or on websites. So Heller's criticisms of the incorrect predictions and hyperbolic interpretations of research by the media are completely valid. since this is where the overwhelming majority of the public gets their information and is how these people form their opinions. Heller exposes the fraud that occurs through data manipulation at NOAA and NASA and how this fraud is communicated to the public through the propagandized corporate media. If Heller is the one who is a TOTAL fraud, it should be a simple matter for any of these mainstream climatologists like Mann, Hayhoe or Hausfather to engage him in a conversation and demonstrate how he is wrong, but you'll never see this occur, because they are the ones committing fraud, and their science can't stand the scrutiny that would occur, if the public were allowed to hear the logic and arguments from both sides.

He has a blog where he pretends to analyse climate data, and he collects newspaper articles making daft predictions about future climate that have turned out false and pretends that they disprove the science. And of course he stokes right-wing craziness, pro-gun-lobby, misogyny, islamophobia and rabid fear of sixteen-year-old girls as well, and his posts are pathetically juvenile, because all these things seem to go hand in hand. I don't know if he also encourages his followers to show up at accident scenes and encourage bystanders to mistrust first responders and prevent them from doing their job. But it's basically that.

I say never unless the climate really was changing in a drastic way. It's very cold at the moment with temps likely to be below freezing in many places tonight. 6 to 7 degrees rise is ludicrous. Let's just play around with computer models and call it science. Even the professor admitted it was an extreme prediction so why he then turned it into a prophecy is anyone's guess.

There's plenty more fossil fuels to find – if we carry on accelerating fossil-fuelled economies, 6 to 7ºC is well within range. He's describing the best science we have. I'm a physicist, I've seen plenty of papers in that range, there's nothing wrong with it. Human nature. If you're not careful, it can become almost automatic to think you know better about science than a science professor at one of the world's top universities. But the alternative possibility – that he may have a better grasp of the situation than you, and you may be mistaken – is worth bearing in mind too.

Isn't it interesting to learn that temperatures of 90F were recorded in the arctic region in the 1920s and 1930s? Or that Scientists were lamenting about loss of arctic sea ice in the 1930s and 1940s? Or should that be something that is kept hidden from the public? Or maybe you think that Dr. Judith Curry is a "wing nut" because she is a vocal critic of climate consensus which she calls "climate change madhouse effect", in which she has highlighted "rampant overconfidence in an over-simplistic theory of climate change", with "enforcement of a politically motivated manufactured consensus".

But real science is about taking an hypothesis and creating a falsifiable experiment to try and destroy the hypothesis. If it stand up then your peers try to bust it. If it stands up time and again it eventually gets accepted as a theory. As far as I can tell, so far there is a global warming hypothesis. I would dare to say that climate science is a very loose science, without the rigger of physics. To add climate science is what people often do because they are not smart enough to work in physics or maths. It is also important to understand the nature of truth. You can never know if you have overlooked something, so you can never know for sure if what you believe is true. We are therefore by default all stuck in a world of guesswork. However, I might have overlooked something, which could make this idea of truth incorrect. However, it is probably accepted by most philosophers.

We knew more than enough about the cause and the seriousness of climate change 25 years ago. The basic facts have not been in any doubt for a long time. Far, far too long. Every competent scientist can see that this is now a genuine international crisis. Our response, our time-wasting and our excuses so far have been utterly pathetic. We can only hope it changes soon, otherwise we will lose so much, it's heart-rending.

What I was trying to get at in my earlier questions regarding equations, though I did not say, is that the climate of Earth is complex, and mathematics is not very good at calculating complex systems. Predicting water vapor 100 years in the future is not going to be easy, and water vapor, if I understand correctly, is the predominant greenhouse gas. Essentially nobody has written an equation for climate that includes all the variables and lays out the relationships between them. There must be hundreds of variables, many unknown.

UgwE6fxbm7X3MgHFnFV4AaABAg	2	2	2019-11-15 20:30:29	Susan Maddison	A good explanation most of the way through -- but then he makes a flatly false statement: that the only way to prevent catastrophic warming is by cutting emissions. <br /><br /> Surely he knows that in fact there is another way: SRM geoengineering. And that in fact, on its own logic, it is SRM that is the only way that is likely to succeed in preventing catastrophic warming. <br /><br /> This seems obvious for the very reasons he gives. As he accurately states, we&#39;re on track, even were there to be drastic emissions reductions, to further feedback loops or tipping points of temperature increase. This renders meaningless any projections about distant future temperature reductions by way of mere emissions reductions. We would have already passed the tipping points.<br /><br /> He is also right that the other, atmospheric carbon reduction forms of geoengineering are decades away from being scalable adequately, by which time more tipping points will have been passed. The one thing we know of that could make it scalable is to succeed in harnessing fusion energy, a matter he doesn&#39;t mention. That leaves SRM and nuclear energy as the things he would logically be pointing to. So why are they being ignored?<br /> One has to find an honest social science to this glaringly obvious question: why he hasn&#39;t faced the glaringly obvious logical implications of his scientific statements -- that emissions cutting isn&#39;t going to prevent warming, not even if we cut emissions far more than there&#39;s any actual chance of cutting them, because we&#39;ve already built more warming into the existing carbon levels and this will take us into tipping points? Despite this, he goes on relying exclusively on the existing emissions reductions program and the only further thought he brings up is to pour still more money into it. <br /><br /> Is it any excuse, that this is the same thing that the international conferences and agreements do, and that the green movement does, and that all the major media do? I think not. It just makes it worse. He is supposed to be the scientist. The scientist who coined the term &#39;global warming&#39; had the courage in his last years to draw the logical conclusions from the same facts and point to the necessity of geoengineering. That was honest, and it is the honesty I expect of a scientist, even though he suffered some vilification for it.<br /> Nor is it a good excuse, to point out that it&#39;s no worse than the governments that have for decades used the dishonest consensus of the movement environmentalists as the sole basis for their operating program. Scientists are supposed to speak truth to power.<br /> Yes, lots of governments have tried hard to cut emissions, often at great cost to their economies and societies, in France destabilizing the government itself in the last year as we saw from the Yellow Vests (and civil conflict can lead to enormous emissions increases); all this with at most a minor effect in slowing the rate of increase of global emissions. The second differential is still positive -- the rate of change in global emissions is still positive, not negative, much less down to zero, much less down to zero minus and thereby reducing carbon levels in the atmosphere -- at a time when, as he says, we need not only the 2nd but the 1st differential and the sum total to be negative in the here and now. <br /><br /> The statement about emissions reductions as &quot;the only way&quot; is a shocking misstatement of obvious fact, coming from a competent scientist. <br /><br /> The fact that this-era SRM geoengineering is not included in this discussion, and is almost never mentioned within the enormous mass of governmental, media, and movement discussion of warming - and most of the few mentions of it are done in order to scare people about it and to organize more institutional obstacles to prevent the proper testing of it - has detracted seriously from the integrity of the discussion. <br /><br /> Were it not for this pervasive dishonesty in the discussion, various forms of SRM including SAI would have been more thoroughly researched by now and adequately tested. We&#39;d have already had a fairly good idea of how to proceed decades ago, we might have gotten started years ago, and we&#39;d have a much better chance of avoiding the feedback loops. As it stands, if we proceeded right now with a crash program of R&amp;D and testing on SRM, it&#39;ll be several years before we could be ready to start acting to stop the warming, with all the risks of feedback loops attendant on even that delay. The dishonesty of the discussion has also intimidated SRM SAI scientists from advocating the needed crash program, lest the whole thing get further destroyed by green movement and media attacks on it like the ones that have prevented nuclear energy from doing its part to reduce emissions.<br /><br /> That same negligence of nuclear energy for emissions reductions, in favor of the much less effective set of renewables, is the other huge piece of dishonesty in the dominant discussion and policies on the matter. . It has set back the prospects for actual emissions reductions by decades. It is probably the main reason why we have failed to stop increasing emissions globally despite the enormously expensive and socially risky efforts that have been put into trying to reduce them in many countries.<br /> There is a crying need for honesty both in the science of this and the social science of it. One cannot, as a minimally competent social scientist, advocate apocalyptically costly programs, in the name of reducing emissions that would probably send some countries into chaos or civil war, with all the actual fires and emissions attendant on that. One cannot say that a program that points in that direction is &quot;the only way&quot;, then acknowledge that it is not nearly enough and cannot be enough, then propose nothing but pouring more into it, and refuse to mention the actual ways that could one. <br /><br /> A logical and scientific person cannot defer to the greens and dominant media and politicians in their refusal of nuclear energy and geoengineering, treating these as inevitable unalterable facts and failing to do the basic scientific job of speaking truth to power about them; while joining them in attacking blindly the actually-inevitable societal resistance to implementing on a catastrophic scale the plans for emissions reductions by way of reliance on renewables. <br /> I thank you, in this video and others before it, for taking on scientific questions that have been dumbed down for the public, talked down to the public about, and presented in simplistic forms lest anyone figure out that there are complex unresolved questions involved in them. I think you have in the present case however missed out on half of the problem in that regard. The program has been dumbed down to the point of lying about it, not just the diagnosis. <br /><br /> In reality, surveys have found that many of those who say they don&#39;t &quot;believe in&quot; global warming will also indicate that what they really mean by this is that they think global warming is real but they don&#39;t support what is presented as &quot;the only way&quot; of dealing with it, because it is both too ineffective and too damaging to society and the economy; and because saying they &quot;don&#39;t believe&quot; is the only answer they&#39;re permitted in order to avoid getting falsely cited, in the media and political interpretations of the surveys on the subjects, as supporters of that &quot;only&quot; way. It is perhaps significant that the most famous denier, Trump, has several times said pretty much the same thing. A large part of the scientific explanatory discussion, dumbed down to tell a presumptively dumb public that it should &quot;believe&quot;, has been not just too dumbed down and patronizing, but missed the actual point. That is the danger of talking in a bubble. I have learned to expect better from your videos, and that&#39;s why I&#39;m taking the trouble to write to you about it.

There is an actual geopolitical nightmare here, but it follows not from SRM but from the failure to test SRM and its side-effects; and, if less risky than lack of SRM (as seems likely), implement it competently. This failure means limiting ourselves to emissions reduction just as you say; which translates as letting the carbon in the air keep warming the planet, and putting lots more carbon into the air as well, just at not quite as fast a pace. Tipping points will inevitably be passed. Countries will be flooded. SRM will then be done anyway, too late, and not very competently, by the most desperate or interested country that' can put together some funds. It's widely known how to do SEM in terms of the basics of it, but we don't know as much as we could or should about how to do it well and minimize risks. That's what R&D and testing are for. It raises the question of why some forces have been slowing and obstructing R&D and testing and the gaining of competence on it. There's no way to stop desperate countries from doing SRM, in the basic, already-known ways, once they start getting flooded much more. After hasty unilateral poorly-done SRM, there really will be competing SRM actions and geopolitical struggles over it. All this seems practically inevitable, if we stick to current plans of limiting ourselves to emissions while the carbon totals are still going up, avoiding even the nuclear energy that could make a real difference on emissions, and avoiding preparations, competence, and timeliness on SRM. It is a very real nightmare that I see in front of us not too long down the road.

Pretty much every scientist I've spoken to or heard from considers it a long, long way from responsible technology. Just cut the emissions. We don't need to be attached to 19th century tech like children clinging to a parent's leg. We certainly don't need to carry on accelerating the problem. We need to stop making so many pathetically desperate excuses, adopt the solutions we already have and get on with it. We have lots of great ideas for drawing down carbon, but the best easily-scalable tech we have for drawing down carbon is still trees. We need to try to find better ones – but no matter what we do, in many parts of the world it will still be trees for a long time. Plant trees. Restore ecosystems. Stop emitting greenhouse gases. It's not hippy nonsense, it's the best science we have. Don't underestimate it.

In France we have been said it is a record temperature, 43°C, but without the (human caused…) global warming it wouldn&#39;t have happend. Sure, we would have got 41,5°C, which without saying, is very different. In both case it is a temperature that we very rarely see, it&#39;s something like 37°, even with the global warming. In short, it is but a statistical fluctuation, not a heavy trend, anyway the air mass came from the Sahara where the temperatures are still higher. And when the summer is cold, we are said nothing, or even &quot;it is because of global warming…&quot; So please, stop taking us for fools and calling us conspiracy or bias, you are the ones who are ridiculous. The confirmation bias is just taking a fluctuation to support ones view.	UCFFgGCT5wFP3-b_P4A-l58A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFFgGCT5wFP3-b_P4A-l58A	0

Tim Palmer&#39;s &quot;models&quot; prove &quot;beyond a doubt&quot; that humans are &quot;almost certainly&quot; the sole cause... most likely as a result of increased carbon dioxide levels.<br />My ranch is located in a desert that 200,000 years ago was a tropical swamp and 50,000 yrs ago was near an ice sheet that covered much of North America... You can see the variation in climate by visiting the Grand Canyon. In 1815, the Indonesian volcano Tambora changed the world&#39;s weather for years. No scientist would get funding if he/she questioned current dogma... which in and of itself raises red flags. The amount of heat from the sun is variable... the tilt of the planet and its position in the solar system/galaxy are variable... and don&#39;t forget volcanism. Very impressive conflation of &quot;basic laws of physics&quot;... &quot;differential equations...&quot; and &quot;quantum mechanics&quot; .... trendy &quot;words&quot; all tossed into the stew to add a veneer of &quot;credibility&quot; to what is really a very muddled discussion of a complex topic. Climate change is now an excuse for governments to raise taxes and increase control on citizens with no hope of halting the changes in world climate.

If people listen with open and receptive minds to Tim Palmer they will learn vital details about a complex problem. The bit about the irreversibility of climate tipping points and the failed logic of relying on CO2 removal is critical information. However, climate modelling is not needed to establish the scientific theory of climate change due to human caused greenhouse gas emissions (in combination with other climate forcing). There is a massive body of observational evidence which, taken together, and in the utter absence of seriously competing theories, is conclusive.

We're the ones causing it. Every scientific organisation on the planet – and there are hundreds – has stated publicly that what humans do now is crucial in determining how it plays out. Not one has disputed it. "it is too late" is just another form of science denial, and just another pathetic excuse for refusing to deal with the problem. Get over it.

If you search 'solar cycle' on Wikipedia, they've got some nice graphs of solar activity--some which even go back for thousands of years. Currently, we're in the solar minimum of a ~100 year solar cycle, as well as a minimum of a 11-year cycle (and numerous solar cycles overlap). However, this must be understood in the framework of the unprecedented solar activity in the last century--especially around the 1960s. Ever since solar activity dipped around the Maunder Minimum, the Sun has become more active. This fact is not misunderstood or evaded by climatologists, which don't see much reason to expect another 'maunder minimum' to come along and neutralize the greenhouse effect. In fact, any alarm which they express is precisely due to the exacerbation of natural warming, which CO2 and other greenhouse gases contribute toward. Also, the ocean stores thermal energy and expresses it according to its own separate cycles--the most important of which come from the Pacific--and we are currently experiencing a 'cold phase' of the PDO (for something like ~2005-2035, I would guess) in which latent energy is held from the surface by a shift in ocean currents. If you need evidence for this (beyond the difference between seas surface temperature and ocean heat content, when their measurements are graphed and compared), simply consider this last El Nino: it's magnitude, and context among relatively restrained seas surface temperatures. A Sun's gonna Sun and we can't know for certain what it will do, but it's not been reduced to a maunder minimum; and there is no reason to assume that it won't climb out of these minimums, as per its usual cycles, and continue to try to knock out our power grid. Meanwhile, the ocean is gaining heat even while it hides it, and when the PDO decides to flip, for example, the changes it will induce thanks to its stored energy will amplify the greenhouse effect--probably much more than before. Don't rest assured.	UCk62tY2svp9QVVMRIdfuzmg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk62tY2svp9QVVMRIdfuzmg	1	Ugxn8jZgsmU0aitqJV14AaABAg	videoformer

Just come out and say it, every model has multiple tuning knobs for which there is no basis. Tuning for past data is easy, but every model runs off the rails for predictive capability. There is no closure on a global scale for Navier-Stokes, the turbulence problem for the range of eddy scales is intractable. And this is not even the real problem (i.e., modeling ocean heat transport on multi-decadale scales). Mentioning weather events such as local flooding takes away any smidgeon of credibility you try to project.	UCqPG45vdqQh4zA64N2vMh6Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqPG45vdqQh4zA64N2vMh6Q	0

These parametrizations are justified usually by physical assumptions. They are far from perfect, but they are not just nonsense without any basis. So different institutions might think other assumptions to be better. But the fact that the spread between the different models is reasonable means that these assumptions are reasonable and not unfounded. One thing that might be done, is simply to do local simulations with a much finer resolution, and then look for appropriate closure relations, which are then used for the global model. This is done all the time and can give pretty decent results. And it is actually how computational research, especially when using the Navier-Stokes equation, can show that we learn something: different models with different parametrizations manage to converge (it is always up to a certain accuracy) to the same answer. Anyway, time will show how good/bad these assumptions were. We should get much better resolution in the near future. Considering the global mean temperature predictions are actually pretty decent, my educated guess would be that these assumptions are at least partly valid and are nowhere near being chosen without any basis...

In all of the history of science that I know, there are many mainstream efforts to both replicate results and to challenge results. Where is this being done within climate science? (Only independent scientists are challenging the mainstream models and predictions). I haven't heard of any insider challenges, EG "Bob's theory is wrong here". There seems to be enough wiggle room to call every model correct within its study parameters. No insider is challenging anything. Palmer goes so far (laughably) to say that the average of all models is a good check on the validity of the models! That is preconceived consensus; all models tuned to about the same result, but just different enough to claim independent thought. Add to that the statements by some prominent insiders that it doesn't matter if the models are correct, because these are promoting the correct outcome of world government and energy austerity. Further, nuclear energy is shunned as a partial solution in favor of low production, high cost wind and solar projects, so loved by politicians. The entire "intergovernmental" project stinks of bias, aimed at delivering more power to governments, while abandoning the rigor of real science. Catcall: If you can't predict, then you must quit.

This &quot;Marshall Plan&quot; for the climate will have far reaching, negative consequences for humanity.

Michael Mann lost his court case because he refused to provide the math behind his hockey stick graph" Yes, I recall he won two cases, and the third against Tim Ball resulted in an apology by the defendant. Which Mann graciously accepted. In the end the case was dismissed due to delay on Mann's legal teams part. There's not much info regarding the defendants lawyers demand for data. But I suspect the data concerned was copyrighted and that it couldn't be released for that reason. A crafty lawyer trick maybe. But in any case, it's not relevant because as I told you, we now have greater than TWENTY FOUR additional hockey stick graphs from different proxy data and different teams that all replicate and verify the original hockey stick graph. So regardless of any "maths that weren't released" we know the original hockey stick graph was valid. "He decided he'd rather pay the defendant's legal fees( possibly millions of dollars )" Mann could not afford millions of dollars, he's a scientist not a multimillionaire. And his employers certainly wouldn't be paying those sums. "In the East Anglia e-mails they are absolutely talking about how to manipulate the numbers to get a desired result." Nope, that's completely wrong. What you are talking about is the "hide the Decline" "trick" accusation by the hackers. There was nothing secretive about this at all. It was an algorithm that was used to account for tree ring data in some northern latitudes that was well known to not accurately reflect atmospheric temperature. It was standard data correction and if they had not done that the results would have been wrong. It was out in the open, and even highlighted in several of their research papers. A well know technique and perfectly valid. I did post this link before, good idea to give it a read. "Mike's Nature trick" refers to a technique (aka "trick of the trade") used in a paper published in Nature by lead author Michael Mann (Mann 1998). The "trick" is the technique of plotting recent instrumental data along with the reconstructed data. This places recent global warming trends in the context of temperature changes over longer time scales. The most common misconception regarding this email is the assumption that "decline" refers to declining temperatures. It actually refers to a decline in the reliability of tree rings to reflect temperatures after 1960. This is known as the "divergence problem" where tree ring proxies diverge from modern instrumental temperature records after 1960. The divergence problem is discussed in the peer reviewed literature as early as 1995, suggesting a change in the sensitivity of tree growth to temperature in recent decades (Briffa 1998). It is also examined more recently in Wilmking 2008 which explores techniques in eliminating the divergence problem. So when you look at Phil Jone's email in the context of the science discussed, it is not the schemings of a climate conspiracy but technical discussions of data handling techniques available in the peer reviewed literature. " https://skepticalscience.com/Climategate-CRU-emails-hacked.htm "It doesn't matter that other countries or universities say they dont see a problem with that." Yes it does matter, some of the reviews were by universities and some independent, there was no wrongdoing. As I said, one of the reviews went right back to the raw data and still got the same results as the scientists concerned. "I said they manipulate data and they do." Unfortunately, what you say isn't automatically fact. "How is it being used to increase government power? Did you read the New Green deal? It's a total government takeover of almost every aspect of the economy." I think that's paranoia on your part, probably republican paranoia. Are you a Trump supporter by any chance. No offence, just wondered. IT's a matter of opinion, personally I see it as the correct strategy to mitigate what ultimately could be an existential threat. "I get it. You're a true believer" I have no choice but to be a believer. I'm a rational person, so I have to take seriously 12000 plus peer reviewed parers. Not to mention research going back to the 1800's. "You can admit being skeptical is what science is all about and yet display very little about something as complex and misunderstood as the global climate" I have healthy scepticism. But that scepticism is no longer healthy if it denies 12000 plus peer reviewed papers. We are now beyond scepticism and should, if we are rational, be in the realm of acceptance and mitigation. The basics of global are well understood, as I say, we have research going right back to Fourier and Tyndall 120 years ago. The greenhouse effect is well understood. The complexity is in terms of time frames, extent, short term predictions and other variables, but we know its happening and we know that ultimately the consequences are worrisome.

The original hockey stick graph wasn't exactly 100% accurate, as it was a first attempt. But since then we have generated an entire hockey team of graphs, each from different proxy data. And they all generate the same hockey stick graph. So multiple lines of proxy data all saying the same thing. "Since the hockey stick paper in 1998, there have been a number of proxy studies analysing a variety of different sources including corals, stalagmites, tree rings, boreholes and ice cores. They all confirm the original hockey stick conclusion: the 20th century is the warmest in the last 1000 years and that warming was most dramatic after 1920." https://skepticalscience.com/broken-hockey-stick.htm As for climate-gate, you are a bit behind the times. There were several investigations. All of those reviews exonerated the scientists in question. In fact one of the reviews went back to the raw data from before the scientists got it. Guess what, the independent investigators came to the same conclusions as the scientists, so no wrong doing discovered whatsoever. this was deliberate misrepresentation by the hackers. The hacking at the time was clearly well orchestrated, and clearly timed to disrupt the Copenhagen negotiations. Nefarious forces at work! "A number of independent investigations from different countries, universities and government bodies have investigated the stolen emails and found no evidence of wrong doing. Focusing on a few suggestive emails, taken out of context, merely serves to distract from the wealth of empirical evidence for man-made global warming." https://skepticalscience.com/Climategate-CRU-emails-hacked.htm "Also, the ipcc is a corrupt, politicized mess." In that they frequently downplay warming to please the politicians. "polar bear extinction" Exaggerated by non experts and the media. This is what the science really says. https://www.carbonbrief.org/polar-bears-and-climate-change-what-does-the-science-say "Artic sea ice" Sometime during the 21st century, sea ice may effectively cease to exist during the summer. Sea ice extent is defined as the area with at least 15% ice cover. The amount of multi-year sea ice in the Arctic has declined considerably in recent decades. So what your issue with that? "Until then at least a little skepticism is called for. When it's being used to increase government power" Scepticism is great. Thats what science is all about. But there's a difference between scepticism and cynicism. How is it being used to increase government power? When so many nations still procrastinate and the US administration even denies it's happening. Many nations, including my own, talk big and do little. "and calls for massive wealth redistributions" Wealth redistribution relates to the enormous and widening gap between rich and poor, a recipe for disaster, the richest 1 percent in the United States now owning more wealth than the bottom 90 percent. So not related to climate change mitigation.	UCf9OPsS0o4ePBlUaMeRq6-g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf9OPsS0o4ePBlUaMeRq6-g	1	UgyHXjsOyHONRBdP9i14AaABAg	Louis Gauthier

If you are going to make a libellous claim like that you need to provide definitive evidence. "make wildly inaccurate predictions" No they dont! It's the media that do that to sell newspapers and get hits on their news websites. Scientists always tell you that they are making a non definitive prediction if that's what they are doing. Climate scientists tell you that models for long term global average temps are pretty accurate, which is true. They also make it absolutely clear that short term prediction is less definitive and difficult. In fact the professor did exactly that in this very video if you had listened. "call those who no longer fall for it science deniers." My friend, we now have a statistical probability of mankind warming the planet of 5 sigma. In scientific terms that's huge. There's a one in a million chance of being wrong. There is no argument anymore, the science is unequivocal on this. How can it be about government control when the US government is fighting tooth and nail to deny climate change is even happening, and of course receiving millions from the fossil fuel industry? In my country we talk big, but do little to fight climate change. In many nations, politicians still procrastinate. In fact every time there's a new IPCC report, it's deliberately dumbed down to suit the politicians. "How the IPCC is more likely to underestimate the climate response" https://skepticalscience.com/ipcc-scientific-consensus.htm Remember... we have know about the greenhouse effect since 1824 and the work of Fourier. This is basic stuff. And we have known human CO2 emissions warm the planet thanks to Svante Arrhenius in 1896. And guess what, way back in 1896 Svante Arrhenius estimate for what we would see today in terms of CO2 emissions and temperature rise were pretty accurate. His predictions from 1896 have come true!

By analyzing records taken from these and other proxy sources, scientists can extend our understanding of climate far beyond the instrumental record. "That's another problem with Climate Science.

In fact we have research going back to the 1800's thanks to scientists like Fourier. This is not some new fad, a conspiracy of some kind. The only misrepresentation of facts is by the fossil fuel industry and certain politicians and right wind organisations funded by fossil fuel companies, desperate to keep selling their polluting product. Exon's own scientists told the company that global warming was real and that the consequences were disastrous. Exon of course, as you have no doubt heard, ignored their own scientists and promptly funded climate deniers to the tune of millions. This is the true conspiracy, the obvious one, don't be mislead. "To strengthen the movement coercion and bullying are now both abundantly applied by those holding powerful government positions" Im not sure how your opinion can be so diametrically opposed to the facts. You must be aware of the activities of right wing organisations funded by the fossil fuel industry. Yes? In fact in the US we have what is tantamount to legalised bribery, with millions being payed to politicians in exchange for doing nothing about climate change. The "bullying" comes from the right wing and fossil fuel industry. That is pretty obvious. "In less than 25 years, the Climate Change Movement has taken control of many governments, the media, politicians, individual citizens, some of the scientific community, and many UN agencies." Which is of course nonsense. It's called fact. Its called unequivocal scientific evidence, its called 4000 plus peer reviewed papers, its called research going back to the 1800's. It's called common sense. Its called basic chemistry. Its called basic physics. in fact man made global warming now has a statistical probability of being correct of 5 sigma.

Do you really think that NASA are so stupid as to hold a position that their data denies? Scientists are not morons. "can you explain how an increasing atmospheric CO2 content can 1) decrease atmospheric temperature, 2) maintain a constant atmospheric temperature, and 3) increase atmospheric temperature?," It doesn't, but other factors both increase and decrease atmospheric temperature due to natural variability. When you look at 10, 20, 30 year periods you will see both an increase and decrease in temperature due to factors like solar activity, changes in ocean currents, increases and decreases in volcanic activity etc. This is precisely why climatologist look at "long term" climate change over periods greater than 30 years. They look at GLOBAL LONG TERM AVERAGE temperature. If you look at temp graphs from the beginning of the industrial revolution, you will see periods where the temperature drops and you will see periods were it increases, you will also see plateaus. These are the peaks and troughs, the "noise" if you like. Looking at average long term global temps eliminates the noise. In short, you have to look at a period from the beginning of the industrial revolution, to today, as an average trend, thus eliminating the peaks and troughs caused by natural variability.

Wider sampling shows greater temperature fluctuations throughout history. No mention whatsoever was made of external influences like the solar cycles. An assumption was made that carbon dioxide introduced by humans was the reason for the change. However, it could be argued that the earth is in a co2 drought as geological evidence shows that the levels were significantly higher in the past, by factors of a thousand. Throughout the talk much emphasis was placed on the difficulty of obtaining data, and the inaccuracies of the data obtained. If all the interested parties are using this same data in their models then of course the perceived <i>trends</i> will align. Perhaps the climatologists should be talking to the archaeologists who are discovering Viking settlements as the Greenland ice melts. I&#39;m sure they know that the earth&#39;s climate was warmer in the past than it is now. And that was without the influence of the industrial revolution&#39;s co2 input.

Large variations in temperature do correlate with variations in CO2 levels over geologic time scales. The claim of climatologists is that the industrial revolution and the large scale burning of fossil fuel has reversed historical trends that would have otherwise had us slowly progressing to another ice age.

Of course they know about the sun. Of course they know about the history of the earth. Their job hinges on these things. Claiming they don't is like claiming that surgeons aren't aware of the nervous system. There are plenty of studies into the possible effect of a grand solar minimum over the next few decades (eg Feulner & Rahmstorf), and the answer is virtually nothing. They take these things into account, and they find out what matters. It's greenhouse gases. No excuses. No conspiracy theories. No fairy-tales. Greenhouse gases. Get used to it.

Rather CO2 causing T raising. Very hard to accept any of proper reasoning beyond [may be] astrological (?). Hope measure water T and pH that is directly related with environmental CO2 level with time like 4 times per year with that water T around the global and looking for the trend, even few years. <br /><br />I have tried looking for the water pH &amp; T from Lake Michigan, Chicago, IL USA those quarterly reporting from Chicago City. T raises but pH not drop (if CO2 level in the water raising pH drop) over 1995-2018 data. <br /><br />Even it is a local, two parts learned or expected: (1) people&#39;s effort reducing fossil based carbon exposures, and (2) Seems CO2 may not the major reasoning for the global warming.

I very much disagree that Global Climate Models such as CMIP5 have given us accurate forecasts of warming over the last two decades or will in the near future. I've read a number of peer-reviewed studies which have found these models in error by ~ 45% on the warm side. Furthermore, your suggestion "It has a great effect, especially on things that cover large areas like hurricanes, jet streams, ocean currents, and continental ice." is not true either. If you watched the video above the professor admits we can't find an AGW signal among the statistical noise attributing severe weather to climate change. For instance, according to Dr. Christopher Landsea, Chief Operations and Science Officer at the US National Hurricane Center in Miami, FL., says there is NO trend of increasing hurricane frequency or severity that they can detect at present. Tornadoes in the US, which has more of them than any other region on earth, during 2018 were recorded at the lowest level ever with the fewest deaths ever measured (10) and none (0) of the two most severe category twisters EF4 and EF5 occurred either.

The elephant in the room is the constant, gradual increase in the entire heat energy of the Earth. That is very slow and very hard to notice, but we are not talking about warming a cup of coffee, we are talking about warming the entire Earth. That is a huge amount of heat energy.

The relative consistency of the different models may, in part, be down to the same model or model principles being used for the different models, a certain pressure not to produce &#39;unorthodox&#39; results, and the relative crudity of the models. As I think you have suggested elsewhere there is a need to invest in improving the modelling.	UCyx9B3UxQCEuz0NBjH10cew	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyx9B3UxQCEuz0NBjH10cew	0

Therefore it is propaganda not evidence.<br /><br />Moreover, as to the reliability of predictions... didn&#39;t they predict an ice free arctic by 2000? Then again by 2010? Then again by 2018?<br /><br />How many wrong predictions does a &quot;scientist&quot; need to make before his or her theories are debunked?<br /><br />Watch a Tony Heller video for real climate science. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHM6-Pk21i4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHM6-Pk21i4</a><br /><br />Lets here Tony and this guy debate... unless we have gone back to appeal to authority?<br /><br />BTW... the difference in intellect between Sabine and this guy is astounding.

(i understand the argument about modern technology and CO2 emissions, but i would like to know if the changes we see today also happened in the past, 500, 1000, 60000000 million years ago. and if so, how life adopt and evolved?) planet earth is constantly changing, does a rise in temperature really such a rare event in this planet&#39;s history?

Firstly, scientists are, of course, aware of the differences in measurement technology between the past and now. You can rest assured that they take all of that into account. Graphs of global temperature from a single source will show the uncertainties. If you feel unsure they're doing it correctly, I'd say you might perhaps be underestimating their intelligence. If you're aware of it, do you really think it's plausible that the experts aren't? As for 130 years being short in geological time, it's true. But there are temperature proxy records spanning thousands of years, and they show that while global average temperature _may_ have been as high as it is now in medieval times (although there's currently agreement that the Medieval Warm Period, as it's known, was a regional, as opposed to global, phenomenon), the _rate_ of current temperature increase is absolutely incredible compared with any from the past. So, to address your final question, a rise in temperature *this fast* is, in fact, extremely rare. Of course, whether a rise this fast has happened before is sort of irrelevant in that the answer to that question doesn't tell us what's happening now. After all, changing CO2 concentration is known to have been responsible for great temperature changes in the past. And, even if something other than CO2 caused a rapid change in the past, that still wouldn't refute the enormous evidence we have that it's responsible now. All other known potential drivers of temperature have been eliminated as possible causes, and every hypothetical piece of evidence that would point at CO2 being the culprit has been found. You can learn about all of this by getting your information from scientific sources, as opposed to political sources, media, and blogs. Virtually every scientific institute in the world is in agreement on these facts.

Some ecosystems are already collapsing such as the coral reefs. Besides there is limits to adaptation : - some regions don't have the means to adapt, and will be dependent on the will of others, - beyond some point human activity will have to be lowered to prevent further environment degradation or collapse. In places where the environment is already heavily strained people will eventually have to leave. And when I look at the way we have dealt with the recent displacements, I am not exactly optimistic for the ones to come. It is also worth noting that climate change is not the only issue we have to deal with, quite a few critical ressource are getting scarce : extracting them is getting harder, messier, and more energy intensive. This include oil, natural gas, phosphates, copper, silver, cobalt, and even sand. It's may not be the end of the world, but very troubled times are ahead if we continue on our trajectory.

The problem we face is not absolute temperature level, it is the rapidity of the change. If we get 4oC warming over 1000 years there will be no problem at all, it is plenty of time for species to adjust, but if it happens over 50 years it will kill species all over the place and lead to crop failures and global starvation. So, I am sorry, but we absolutely have to be a bit human-centric, the rest of the planet biodiversity is relying on us to protect ourselves and every species from ourselves.

Evolution urgently needs plants which grow faster, bigger and need less water with increased CO2 levels. The lowest level is more interesting: at 150ppm all plants die as much as we will (no food).

From this : https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/GlobalWarming/page3.php you can read "As the Earth moved out of ice ages over the past million years, the global temperature rose a total of 4 to 7 degrees Celsius over about 5,000 years" that's roughly 0.01 degrees Celsius per decade. Recent satellite measurements give a trend of 0.2 and 0.13 degrees Celsius per decade, that's at least ten times faster (http://images.remss.com/msu/msu_time_series.html, https://www.nsstc.uah.edu/climate/2019/october2019/GTR_201910Oct_1.pdf) You could also look at this : https://xkcd.com/1732/	UCUBZMwuuyg-wwvawSyjb8zA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUBZMwuuyg-wwvawSyjb8zA	1	Ugzd7jL2_7ISbm9QY0V4AaABAg	amir steklov

UgzPNzZBJHNH5oicsNR4AaABAg	3	0	2019-11-15 18:08:47	Kah7654	It&#39;s a very complex topic which is hard to discuss rationally today, but I still want to add some remarks:<br /><br /><br />The speed of climate change matters a lot. We are at the point of having the technologies to make a soft transition to co2 neutral energy production, but it will take some time and lots of money to do it. The longer we wait, the cheaper it will get because technology improves which in turn reduces costs. <br /><br /><br />So the question &quot;how much time do we have&quot; is very important because if we have the time we can do this soft transition, if not we need a harder kind of transition which may have lots of problematic side effects. If we create world wide political turmoil because of such a hard transition this could lead to lots of death and suffering, too. For example even a local thermonuclear war because of such turmoil could easily have much more severe consequences than moderate global warming. So it&#39;s important to be cautious here.<br /><br /><br />The developing countries have the right to build up some wealth. But if this also leads to an even faster growing population, this could increase co2 production even more. If you look at the co2 emission curve of India, it&#39;s easy to see how increasing wealth results in an increasing co2 production. The growth in India alone can easily nullify all European efforts to reduce co2 production and we&#39;re not even talking about Africa and Indonesia here.<br /><br /><br />Also just giving them money (&quot;Marshall plan&quot;) is something we tried for some decades now and it didn&#39;t work. The reason are the political instabilities in most of those countries and as long as those exists, the money only makes some dictators and authoritarian regimes richer. This is the big difference to the European countries after WWII where democracy had some tradition even with some interruptions as in Germany (which in turn resulted to a huge degree from the poverty caused by the combination of the treaty of versailles and the global recession). How to implement working democracy in those countries is still an open problem.<br /><br /><br />Also a big problem with the current discussion are the people who want to do some kind of &quot;system change&quot;. This is risky because many people don&#39;t want this change and thus are opposed to act against climate change because they think that every action against climate change also needs some kind of system change too. This isn&#39;t correct in my opinion (in fact I think that our current &quot;capitalist&quot; system is best suited to act against climate change compared to other systems like socialism or communism). But as long as this &quot;acting against climate change needs a system change&quot; narrative is used, it creates lots of opposition against useful ways of action (like investing heavily in photovoltaics and electrical cars).

Taking into consideration recent &quot;big picture healthy skepticism&#39;s&quot; by Sabine Hossenfelder (such as &quot;The crisis in physics is not only about physics&quot; <a href="https://backreaction.blogspot.com/2019/10/the-crisis-in-physics-is-not-only-about.html">https://backreaction.blogspot.com/2019/10/the-crisis-in-physics-is-not-only-about.html</a> or &quot;Is Climate Change Inconvenient or Existential?

An extra level of complexity not touched on in this interview, is the inherit highly political nature of climate models, that makes them prime targets for corruption, manipulation and weaponisation. Such &quot;social uncertainties&quot; should likely be factored into the models themselves to make them more robust and realistic - especially given these models are (almost by definition) highly &quot;closed source&quot; and exclusive, due to required specialized personnel, computational resources etc.	UCsHgGVOHp5oruJ3-9o0FcmQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsHgGVOHp5oruJ3-9o0FcmQ	0

If you're interested, the magnitude of the effect of solar variations on climate is minuscule compared to that of greenhouse gases, even for a grand solar minimum (e.g. Feulner & Rahmstorf, 2010)	UC-Xz0kbedHc6JV9BkSRpbrg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-Xz0kbedHc6JV9BkSRpbrg	1	UgzJ0RqcSe_ez_43NTt4AaABAg	Jim Hofoss

Everybody who has ever done these kind of simulations knows, <br />that you can cheat to get everything you want without having anyone beeing able to realize. Only experiment can judge this.<br /><br />Physics problems much less complicate (like Kondo Problem - one correlated impurity in a metall with linear<br />equations) are far away from really predicting measurements on &lt;1% like this community claims (1%=2.7Kelvin).<br />And on the Kondo Problem we have many helping experiments.<br /><br />Now Tim Palmer claims they do not only want to make predictions over times spans,<br />that are much beyond their government payed retirement, but also to forcast on time scales like 5 years individual<br />events. Lets wait for the first volcano eruption they get right on a 3 month grid... <br /><br />But other than the 30years research without progress* worth mentioning compared to before 1982,<br />this climate community is stronly influencing politics and our life beyond just eating some taxpayer money.<br /><br />There has to be an open public debate on this CO2 Myth, otherwise this Religion has the power to destroy our<br />democratic system.<br /><br />*High TC, Quantum Computing,Cold Fusion,String Theory, etc.	UCcfZ2cdd_jklhVK7PjHOYFg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcfZ2cdd_jklhVK7PjHOYFg	0

What we do get to do is to try to understand them, so we can make use of them, and we can build our democratic civilizations around them. If we're not stupid. And I really hope we're not.

We dont need to publicly discuss how lasers work as long as I am not forced by democracy to buy one. Of course you may even argue that 99% of science is not discussed public but still payed by a democatic system.

I think the overwhelming consensus is well established on that. We conservatives tend to engage in the worse kind of hyperbole about the scientific community being corrupt and a &#39;tool for ANTIFA and the left&#39; who are trying to destroy the basis for Western civilization. The left is totally crazy in that regard. <br /><br /><br />However, where I have problems is when climate scientists stray outside their limited range of knowledge and start talking about crash programs to keep levels below 2% at all costs or we are doomed. That is not science at all. Further, radical changes in the economic systems on a worldwide basis that could very well mean the death of billions of people and the impoverishment of much of the remaining population, is NOT the purview of climate scientists. It is grossly irresponsible for any climate scientist to advocate such a thing. Climate scientists are not politicians and they are not economists. This gentlemen speaks only about the science of climate change. That&#39;s his area of expertise. In that area alone, he should be listened to. His voice is one of reason and logic. Others? Not so much. They are the ones whose desire is to foment revolution and Marxist ideology while using climate science as a shield. Their hope is that people will not see through the smoke screen and see them for what they are.	UCH2UhY2Bkq2FOkgqEKv8OrA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH2UhY2Bkq2FOkgqEKv8OrA	0

This is what they have been doing all along, search the literature and you will find where emails were discovered from the leaders in the Climate Scam discussing the need to tweak the models, even more, to give more positive results for their cause! The fact is the field of climate Scientists just like the field of Particle Physicist is overcrowded and so there is fierce competition for funds, or as they are doing now, creating hysteria to have governments pump large amounts of money into supporting climate research. <br /><br /><br />The only thing that is good in science is the Truth, As Richard Feynman might have said, Nobody cares what you think or want if it is not the truth!<br /><br /><br />By the way, the so-called 97% consensus came from the group of people who wrote positive papers on the subject that CO2 causes climate change. The temperature rose before the CO2 rise. Follow the link of Scientists who are interested in the Truth.<br /><br /><br />Any so-called scientist who is found to be knowingly distorting the truth should lose any tenure they may have or never be given tenure and be kicked out of whatever University they are in.

UgwbWATU-KvJtC7hdwp4AaABAg	0	1	2019-11-15 17:29:06	Jaycee	As the NYT article said the predictions of climate change were based on a scientific consensus. The problem is that the consensus almost by definition is wrong since its basis is sociological rather than scientific. The International Panel was between a rock and a hard place. If its views fully recognised the uncertainty about the range and likelihood of possible outcomes its recommendations would have been rejected. To get any action on climate change it meant that the whole scientific community would have to stand by simple recommendations. These were not written in stone but subject to revision. The politicians and journalists did not understand this and the climate change deniers would have used this uncertainty to argue that climate change was not real. The difficulty of modelling global warming over time even when effectively smoothed over the whole globe shows that we are in massive difficulties dealing with the local or regional phenomena often highly non-linear which are the ones which directly affect the population. The other problem is that climate science was given virtually no priority by funding organisations until everything started going pear-shaped. Vital baseline data is missing and in many areas doing the catching up reveals lurking problems which we should have known about decades ago.

Well, the main reason is that the discussions and models ignore the SUN. As it turns out, the sun is NOT what we all thought it was just a few years ago. As it turns out, the sun changes over time. It runs in CYCLES. And, as it turns out, Prof Tim Palmer ignores the sun as well.<br /><br />So how do we KNOW the sun is not what we were taught in school for years and years? Well, as it turns out, there is an observatory, SDO. All you have to do is check out the footage...close to LIVE FOOTAGE of SDO. Here&#39;s a link, in fact to <a href="http://solarham.com/">Solarham.com.</a>..<a href="https://www.solarham.net/latest_imagery/211.htm...Anybody">https://www.solarham.net/latest_imagery/211.htm...Anybody</a> with eyeballs can easily watch the sun now through the lense of SDO. As it turns out, the sun has changed DRAMATICALLY over the last 4 years! You don&#39;t need any education whatsoever to observe that the sun has changed. Just a pair of eyes.<br /><br />Here&#39;s a link to footage at 211 angstroms...<a href="https://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/assets/img/latest/latest_4096_0211.jpg...see">https://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/assets/img/latest/latest_4096_0211.jpg...see</a> the dark areas? They&#39;re called &quot;coronal holes.&quot; As it turns out, the dark areas are places where less radiation is &quot;emitted&quot; , yet are the main source of solar wind &quot;particles.&quot; Those are not subatomic particles, but matter from the sun. Just 5 years ago coronal holes were very small. NOW coronal holes nearly engulf the entire earth-facing disk.<br /><br />In addition, as you can see for yourselves, there are no sunspots at the moment on the earth-facing disk. 5 years ago, it was COMMON to have 5 or more sunspots facing the earth at any one time. NOW it is unusual to see ANY SUNSPOTS!<br /><br />What does all this mean? Well, we could all have years of discussion on what it all means. <br /><br /><br />But, in short, it means:<br />1) The sun is not what we were taught...IOW not a ball of gas held together by gravity<br />2) The sun is actually condensed matter...and that changes EVERYTHING, but we don&#39;t have time for everything today<br />3) Since the sun is changing, then in turn, it changes the weather on earth without ANY regard for any human caused events<br /><br />ANY DISCUSSION about &quot;climate change&quot; that leaves out the sun is an intellectually DISHONEST discussion. So as it turns out, ALL the models are wrong because they all ignore the sun.	UCX2vZRSYLcn12NJJJF4RkSQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX2vZRSYLcn12NJJJF4RkSQ	0

We know the Mediterranean water levels have changed in two thousand years, we found the now undersea archeology. Miami streets were periodically flooded in the 1960s before threats of climate change were a thing. Maybe, just maybe, we can stop arguing about how many places after the decimal point we need to take this and start talking about protecting the only planet we will inhabit for at least the next one hundred years. Boring and no one&#39;s ego gets stroked but the idea just might have merit.	UCCFueH67HLTe0wQhp5anxrg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCFueH67HLTe0wQhp5anxrg	0

Having a disinterested scientist look into climate change is a great idea!<br /><br />It seems that grid size is a limiting factor in these models in that it drives up computation time and forces these parameterizations that might &quot;cloud&quot; the results. Although higher resolution does not always mean higher accuracy, decreased grid size does often improve accuracy (that is up to a point where the grid size is several times smaller than the things being modeled).<br /><br />Also , as you point out, true error bounding would be good to do as well and thus that too would dramatically increase the computational loads.<br /><br />Perhaps developing ways of distributing that on peoples personal computers to run in background might be a possible factor to help deal with that computational load sort of like they did with SET@home, e.g. see<br /><br /><a href="https://www.planetary.org/explore/projects/seti/setihome.html">https://www.planetary.org/explore/projects/seti/setihome.html</a><br /><br />Also having good visualization tools that shows graphically what is happening in the model might help as well.<br /><br />One other thought here is that if one goers the SETI@home route that having a way for those who host pieces of that processing on their home computers to also view the datas might enhance that over all process and thus crowd source some of the human handling the care and feeding of these processes involved as well as might also better educate and also incentive people to participate in that process. <br /><br />Also, one huge resource here might be retired people (particularly with with some degree of technical backgrounds) that still want to contribute to the world but at home and on their own schedules and levels of commitment as well as the young who are the largest stake holders in all this.

Imagine an organisation that would have decided that the observation of parallax is confirmation bias and conspiracy theory, and that there is a great danger that the earth be kicked out of its central position.

It has to do with what direction moisture-laden air is coming from, and what‘s in it’s way. I’m not a Sahara expert, but I can tell you our own southwestern desert springs from the fact that weather for most of N.A. primarily comes from the Pacific and moves west-to-east, and the first thing it hits on its way is a series of mountain ranges. The desert starts in the lee(s) of these ranges, and fades as you go further east, lessening their effects. Presumably, the Sahara springs from a similar situation; or it could just be the entire mass of Europe / Asia / Africa (depending on direction) is between it and the nearest ocean.

We need satellites monitoring global cloud changes simultaneously around the globe (most importantly, over the oceans), for decades, before we will have enough data to confine our models in a conclusive manner. Until we have that, the resolution of a model will only be accurate within the parameter which created it (meanwhile producing the same results as a completely separate, contradictory model).

Ugy8O9fXrnxgfa3TSK14AaABAg	0	0	2019-11-15 17:11:27	David Brelin	A very thorough assessment of the state of climate change. The climate hysteria comes mainly from politics and economic markets. The fact that the IPCC modeling (up until last year when they switched datasets from CMIP5 to CMIP6) wasn&#39;t impressed upon the global population and their governments, has not helped. The Al Gore&#39;s and Greta Thurnberg&#39;s of the world - using the IPCC&#39;s outdated CMIP5 modeling, have wrongfully attributed anthropogenic contributions towards climate change. This has resulted in extremism like AOC&#39;s Green New Deal where we delegitimize entire economies (and indeed social order) in the name of climate science.<br /><br />Should we reduce pollution and fouling of the environment? By all means yes! But outlawing cattle ranching, and electrifying all of transportation globally (yesterday if possible) is ludicrous! We (humankind) would be better served by using our intellect to adapt to the new normal while slowly transitioning away from profligate polluting in an orderly manner that is fair for everyone.<br /><br />Humankind has survived several extinction level events already by using our superior intellect and we will do so again.

The professor immediately starts off by talking about the models (there are no correct results from models until solar and cosmic particle forcings are used in it anyway - these will be included in the results IPCC publishes in 2020, these are not included atm. - only some models use it and NOT A SINGLE ONE of those leaves room for anthropogenic warming). There is no point in going to that step (creating models) as even majority temperature data is collected near cities with heat contamination. Also there is extremely dubious adjustments made to the data I have no doubt to believe in as the raw data is from NASA and NOAA, Tony Heller ( "Debugger King" - debugger for your i7 processors in your PC, Apple, Motorola etc. - no mistake goes unseen) explains very well just putting the data together we all could - https://youtu.be/-JkEEq3k8yM?t=13 And, for anyone who understands quantum physics, the saturation of CO2 absorption should be really easy to digest - https://youtu.be/8-zaQWAaPAg?t=647	UCSQ6-ATXyfwaLN4TBuaTAsQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSQ6-ATXyfwaLN4TBuaTAsQ	1	UgzzKCS1nxvlUaj_TUJ4AaABAg	Wilfried Dehne

The global mean temp for that period doesn't have anything like a 1ºC uncertainty. Re "the last few years", the graph shown here only runs to 2012. We've had seven years since then, and they've been well within or above the model range. It's a shame they weren't included. It's easy enough to find graphs that do include them if you're curious.

Plus, on the presented graph, it looks like the modelled anomaly average is approximately double the observed readings and getting more divergent since about 2000, not to mention the black “observed” line for the last few years does not corroborate “The Times” story claim at all.

To me, that would demonstrate that increasing temperatures result in increasing CO2 levels and not the other way around. <br /><br />This data also lines up with the medieval warming period, which happened roughly 800 years ago. Meaning that what we&#39;re seeing today is a direct result of the natural cycle that happened 800 years ago, and not from carbon emissions now. <br /><br />If this were truly a feedback loop, then we are long since doomed.

Also, his admission that the science isn&#39;t settled is important. &quot;Settled science&quot; is one of the more irritating bromides I hear. <br /><br />As for developing the technology to suck the CO2 out of the atmosphere, I don&#39;t think we need that; Nature has a way. Rising CO2 levels have been greening the earth, and the increased vegetation will either &quot;suck it out&quot; or mitigate the rise.

We travel by air less or rather only if necessary; we don&#39;t go on holidays as frequently; we don&#39;t stock our cupboards with imported foodstuffs; buy bottle water from OS; we don&#39;t have cars just to drive around in for fun; we don&#39;t buy products made from rain forrest timbers etc etc. I mean we can go on at infinitum almost. It is the population which has to change its way of living (standards- energy supply and demands have to change). What that means is going to be different for everyone. <br /><br /><br />Let&#39;s say for one moment super accurate, no questions, no doubts models existed right now. The upshot/results of these would be to produce some data which was so damning and immediate that we/governments should act immediately in curbing emissions (almost like the CFC scare for want of a better example while i type this) because if that is not the case this scientist typing this holds little faith in serious changes.

Then just use your coin example to get a feeling for it. The mean of 30 coin tosses (high frequency) can be bounded in error easily. Now make it a bit more interesting. Change the rate of head/tails of the coin per time by an amount constant in time. As long as the change is slow (low frequency) you can recognize and model it easily despite the fact you are not able to model one coin toss. The easiest example, the Lorenz attractor: You can from a not extremely accurate starting position not tell where you will be in t time steps. But the time average is easy to calculate. Second example - logistic equation: This is a highly chaotic system. It depends heavily on the initial values. Now introduce a random walk in space into the model. Suddenly the system is not dependent on the initial condition at all on average. Because we introduced averaging by a random walk which allowed the system to switch from one initial condition to another. From the perspective of Fourier analysis: The averaging removes all high frequencies. The remaining frequencies are low and therefore deterministic and can easily be modelled. The high frequencies remove the dependency on the initial condition by allowing to switch initial conditions.

Tim Palmer gave an excellent summary on the state of the art of climate modells, and you asked the right questions, to get a deeper insight. I like it! (And as a computer scientist I like the floating globe. 50 years ago, I build a small one out of a pencil sharpener that was build into a globe. Nice detail in the background.)

With permanent magnets its (nearly) impossible to find an equilibrium of both involved forces: the magnetic force, that pulls the globe upwards and the gravitational force, that pulls the globe downwards. To see, why it is so, write down the Lagrange formula for the physical system, solve the differential equation to get the equations of motion. In case you calculate only for the z-axis, its only one equation. Then find the first and second derivative. You will see, there is only one point of an equilibrium between magnetic and gravitational force. In this point, the first and second derivative need to be zero to keep the globe in this point. You can test it with variation calculus, and you will see, even an infinite tiny change of the position or speed or acceleration will bring the globe out of its stable position. It will fall to the ground or fly to the magnet. In catastrophe theory (not to mismatch with chaos theory) this is a catastrophe machine of first order. (@Sabine: I'm a fan of this theory, and its the reason why I like your song “Casandra” so much: cause of the sentence: “I have a degree in catastrophy”. When I heard it first, I remembered the course in catastrophe theory in the late 70th...) To let the globe float, it needs a simple PI control. Easy to calculate and easy to build. If you say: “But there are levitating pens that can stand vertical on your desktop with no connection to anything, only build of permanent magnets.” then, yes, that's true. They are made of a ring magnet on the desk (or better say: above the desk) and a cylindrical magnet in the pen. If you calculate the motion equations (this time in 3 dimensions, or at least in 2) you will find out, that the equilibrium is in a wide (relatively wide) range. If you write a simple program, to pay with the parameters, you will see, how deep the center of mass of the pen needs to be beyond the ring magnet, to let the pen float in the air. Here, the center of mass is the crack-point... More fun is the floating spinning top that can float several centimeters above a ring magnet. But here math is more complicated, cause the top is stabilized by its gyroscopic effect. You may find lots of videos on YouTube titled “Magnetic Levitating Top” or similar. Have fun!

You make it spin by hand and it will rotate for minutes and minutes. If you look carefully it sometimes turns slower than at other moments. In terms of controls it doesn't need any, it is a passive system.There also exist versions which have a "computer controlled" stabilization system, but it doesn't need to be that much sophisticated, at all.

If humanity is to blame for putting to much CO2 in the air these day's? I can't say for sure. However. I do know this. We are killing or killed lots and lots of carbon "'eating" lifeforms. Called trees, plants and also phytoplankton in our oceans. And also there are not much active volcano's around these day's. Then there is this. We almost burned through all the oil that was available on Earth. Lots of it, burned in very insufficient engines. Thus putting a lot of it in the air. I belief we can draw some conclusion from it. That humanity is at least responsible for a great deal the problem.	UC-z59SWfYjY5tJ7w31grskQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-z59SWfYjY5tJ7w31grskQ	1	UgxQW6t8oFC9ugw__2d4AaABAg	JeKijkbuis

So Scientists deserve kudos for their realistic predictive models many of which were developed before supercomputers could bear the brunt of the complex equations. The argument seems to be wether man is to blame or wether it's a natural periodical reversal in the global climate.

I have never been able to shake my skepticism that any iterative model that loops thousands of times to get to a result, which multiplies errors in the data, errors in the models of all the affected subsystems, etc. would be able to sense the small change in CO2 from 380 to 400 ppm or whatever it now is, without being overwhelmed by inadequacies in the overall approach. So many subtle variable Albedo effects in so many systems, particularly cloud models, seem to me to be of larger magnitude. Noting that their are dozens of models, this seems to point to the built in intractability of the problem. So glad Newtonian physics doesn&#39;t need dozens of models to time the fall of an apple from a tree.	UCGHlRuITuwxoJ5NOflJgItA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGHlRuITuwxoJ5NOflJgItA	0

No travel, little manufacturing, little trade, and in some places, food shortages. We're mostly living off small stockpiles made when we were in 'higher carbon' mode over a month ago. A few more months and the full deprivation will hit home. As my other post is referencing a twitter post ( I assume you have that) you can address why we are in a crisis.

Equatorial oceans sea water being the warmest it would stand to reason they are the most saturated with energy and the Hadley cells are the main bulk of the climate engine. Cold air moves from the poles to the equator, warm air moves to the poles from the equator and the oceans create the climate from solar energy. After albedo the real time power of solar irradiance is 960 W/m^2 they don't even include that in the political energy budget. They use third rate geometry math to divide it by 4 over the entire globe as an average including day and night. That may be correct math yes but it *is* lazy math none the less. The main bulk of the solar irradiance falls on the Equator, powering the Hadley cells, it is NOT evenly divided by 4. The second part falls over the Ferrel cells and the least amount covers the Poles that is not divided evenly by 4. Real solar irradiance should be configured properly by the cosine and calibrated in real time regional and time appropriate. Then an actual guideline for energy can be established and the rest can be allocated correctly. Until then we have weak science giving poor results.

Oceans are powered by soar energy, massive amounts are transferred to the Equatorial oceans that in turn creates osculations, ~10, ~60, ~100 year cycles store incredible energy creating the El Nina and La Nina phenomenon respectively. The absolutely only thing that can effect ocean temperatures besides solar energy is geothermal energy.

Your "perturbing your parameters" jolted my memory. It's a simple thing, not rocket science or climate science. I've written computer simulations to calculate average and maximum wait times for elevators to avoid wasting space by having too many elevators. So the model user can only specify persons arriving in 10 minutes, maybe 550 for an office tower, but arrival is randomized just like it would be in reality which randomization is perturbing your parameters because bods randomly just miss an elevator by 1 second on 1 model run and maybe just barely catch it another time. So we run the model 100 times and obtain 100 results which tells us that the elevators won't get overwhelmed when persons arrive in random groups and nobody ever waits more than 3 minutes and almost everybody waits 30 seconds. It frequently collapsed like a "tipping point" when the developer tried to remove 1 elevator to save space & cost. I saw it (a sort of "tipping point") happen 4 times in real life (so not just the model) that I recall: - Toronto Lester B Pearson Airport when the luggage carts ended up like a traffic gridlock - Ryerson College Toronto library elevators (students!) - Scarborough Centennial Hospital Toronto with 1 elevator broken - 10 San Romanoway rental tower Toronto (mums with carriages & groceries) Total collapse in those cases. Have to sit it out for 1 hour until everybody else is gone, or take the stairs.	UCGcEOvg7z8aL9LvTH4QFnWA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGcEOvg7z8aL9LvTH4QFnWA	1	UgzbZTF_V2wl98Kp9Ud4AaABAg	mlytle0

If climate is deterministic what are the key equations and how should they be applied? Now a physics question for you. When climate alarmists tell us about back radiation what process does that? The radiation emitted by the air? So the atmosphere up to the edge of space is a blackbody emitter? Or is it just another name for quantum excitation and emission? That is the sign of a cult . to replace perfectly good descriptions with insider jargon.

I am taking my lead from M. Nakamura writing on climate models. you cannot expect much from micky mouse models.

CO2 emissions from human activities are responsible for 65% of the net heat input over the last century or so. That net heat input is the cause of the global mean temperature rise. The remainder is caused by increases in emissions of other greenhouse gases (again by human activities): mainly methane, N2O and a number of halogenoalkanes. About a third of the heating caused by CO2 emissions occurs by direct absorption and re-emission of IR radiation. The other two-thirds occurs by a positive feedback effect in which the higher temperature caused by direct absorption increases the water vapour content of the atmosphere, this water vapour absorbs more IR, adding further to the greenhouse effect, which increases the water vapour content further, and so on. So *direct* absorption of IR by CO2 only accounts for 20 to 25% of the total net heating. But CO2 emission accounts for 65% of the cause of the current rate of net heat input, and human activites account for 100% of it. Global surface temperatures fluctuate because heat is continually exchanged between oceans, land and air - but the net heat input is continuous. 30 quintillion joules accumulating every day, day after day, month after month, year after year, and gradually accelerating as we carry on dumping these gases into the sky.

Most of them have been struck off for incompetence. And of course they claim it's a conspiracy. And of course they're wrong, and their arguments are childish and dull.

Do you really think all the world's scientists agree? Why don't you get your students to do some research to come up with a list of scientists who disagree with catastrophic AGW, or at least have their doubts. And ask them not to disregard American scientists just because they are American. You threw Dunning Kruger effect at me. I'll throw you confirmation bias. And by the way, I don't have any science for you to fault. What I do have is logic and judgement.

If you're promoting misleading ideas about science in public, and you insist that it's not you, it's all the world's scientists who are wrong - or if you insist that the world's scientists agree with you when they very clearly don't - then any scientist is going to think you're an idiot. If your opinion is that scientists should be too polite to say such things, that’s a reasonable point of view. I'm sure there are many who would agree with you there.

I'm just saying that not everyone agrees that the science is settled. There are lots of scientists who disagree with catastrophic AGW. Lindzen is just one of them. One of his arguments is that the models used are by no means reliable. Watching this video seems to support this view. They could be correct but Prof Palmer himself was saying that much more processing power is needed before a greater degree of confidence can be gained in them. If you want me to vote for a goverment that is going to make me replace my gas boiler and central heating system then you will have to try harder.

That's why I'm employed to investigate, understand and communicate science. You're distracting from the fact that you were happily tossing out an argument from authority and credentials about Lindzen, while the vast majority of exceptionally highly-authoritative and well-credentialled people think he's plain wrong.

"Dr. Michael Mann and other climate scientists have been investigated by a third party to see if there was any wrongdoing in the "Climategate" scandal. And once again, they were cleared of any wrongdoing. They had been previously cleared by an International Panel of Scientists last year, by a panel at Penn State, and have been cleared by various other agencies as well. This time, the investigation was conducted by the National Science Foundation, and you can read the report in full here. Like the other investigations, the NSF found no evidence of falsifying data, manipulation of data, or destruction of data by Dr. Michael Mann or any of the climate research scientists based at the University of East Anglia."

Bet you wish you could come up with such bollocks: "Already in his PhD dissertation, Lindzen made his first significant contribution to science, laying the groundwork for our understanding of the physics of the ozone layer of the atmosphere.[22] After that, he solved a problem that had been discussed for over 100 years by some of the best minds in physics, including Lord Kelvin, namely, the physics of atmospheric tides (daily variations in global air pressure).[23] Next, he discovered the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO), a cyclical reversal in the prevailing winds in the stratosphere above the tropical zone.[24] Then, Lindzen and a colleague proposed an explanation for the “superrotation” of the highest layer of Venus’s atmosphere (some 50 times faster than the planet itself), a model that is still being debated.[25]"	UCwFa6lTpVfbh6-uwwvTF-rQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwFa6lTpVfbh6-uwwvTF-rQ	1	UgzbZTF_V2wl98Kp9Ud4AaABAg	mlytle0

I didn't think about it until I browsed a picture book on global hazards. Question 1: is climate science deterministic random or chaotic? Question 2: does the math in the models lead to non linearity all by itself? Question 3: do we have sample data for all domains? Meteorology man has already pointed out 2 and 3. Question 4: are you applying the science from the correct domain? When it comes to the greenhouse discussion I wonder if a heat engineer could clear things up using a square meter of concrete heated to 37 celsius by the sun. Then calculate the energy amounts rationed by conduction convection and radiation (before even worrying about CO2 and IR absorption lines).

Stick your head outside once and a while you might see the world better. Where is this "alarming out of control warming" happening? Besides the models that run hot, nowhere else is it happening in the real world. The average global surface temperature is 288 Kelvin/15C/59F. That has not changed since 1952 when the International Standard Atmosphere was established. Of the 104 key location/region temps I use every day, no more than 20 regions (10%) in the entire world are over 80F/26.6C and that doesn't change. Most of the time it's only 14 regions and of those regions few ever reach 90F/23.2C. In fact I haven't seen 100+F temps since the summer in the Northern Hemisphere. Climate changes. Warming periods happened and will happen again, cold periods have happened and will happen again. You want to fret about something fret about pollution, that's a real problem. Food supply for 7 billion people in a mini ice age will be a problem. CO2 is not a driver of climate, CO2 is not a driver of temperature and most certainly CO2 is not the problem.

Yes, I agree he said that the different model results gave a level of confidence. I also agree that he said greater levels of confidence can be achieved by using stochastic methods which need greater processing power. He also said he at Oxford were currently engaged in doing that. What he didn't give though was the results of that work, presumably because it's still a work in progress. So, we are back to whether the results from different models give 'enough' confidence. You seem to imply that you think they do. I infer from Sabine's line of questioning that she doesn't. I may be wrong on that as I thought she did a great job of being totally neutral, but the fact that she was asking for greater levels of confidence I think backs up what I'm saying.

Palmer said smaller grids are necessary to create models of local climate change effects. The global effects variation is due to the inherent variability of nature and lack of computing resources. Palmer mentioned he would like to see stochastic modeling of climate change, which because of the limitations of computing resources, cannot readily be done. Stochastic modeling would allow tighter confidence intervals, as I suggested by the analogy to the Central Limit Theorem. The graph Hosenfelder displayed and asked him about, especially regarding the lack of confidence intervals, seems like it confused people. The variability in the models around the (weighted?) average (the line in red), as Palmer said, constitute the confidence intervals at this point. The agreement among models seem awfully damn good, in fact.	UCy7VpEkuHeIzDEIWSOd-iSQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy7VpEkuHeIzDEIWSOd-iSQ	1	UgzbZTF_V2wl98Kp9Ud4AaABAg	mlytle0

Misleading statement. All of the input parameters to this problem are known. All of the quantities of materials, the shape and geometry of the charge can be measured or determined precisely at time = zero. This is the precise opposite of what a Climate scientist is dealing with. Their starting point is data that may or may not be representative of the geographic locations where they are taken. Not all of the physics, particularly the modeling of the albedo of clouds, interactions with the oceans, efficacy of the nuclei in the atmosphere, as sites for aggregation of moisture, all of these processes are still in theoretical flux. I'm sure the people at Los Alamos DID run more than one model, I'm sure they tinkered, but it was resolved within the timespan of WW2. Climate models have been worked on for well over two decades now, by probably a far greater number of researchers, That tells you the difference in complexity, and suggests a floundering enterprise. Actually the very fact that the Los Alamos models could be run on a desktop computers in seconds as you say, and climate models need supercomputers also tells you the two problems are not in the same league. Yours was a poor example.	UCGHlRuITuwxoJ5NOflJgItA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGHlRuITuwxoJ5NOflJgItA	1	UgzbZTF_V2wl98Kp9Ud4AaABAg	mlytle0

My understanding of what he said certainly endorses what you said, but he was also saying that the inability to model accurately in small enough grids and the need therefore to use parameters instead, led to uncertainty in the predicted global temperature rises. That was my understanding of what he was saying.	UCwFa6lTpVfbh6-uwwvTF-rQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwFa6lTpVfbh6-uwwvTF-rQ	1	UgzbZTF_V2wl98Kp9Ud4AaABAg	mlytle0

But quite early on, from about minute 14 I think, Sabine questioned him on the reasons why there was such a wide range of predicted global temperatures in 2100. As I recall it was stated that the range was due to different models being used. Sabine then questioned why no degrees of confidence were given for each model's prediction. As I recall the answer was that it takes a great deal of computing power to do this, but Oxford University are doing it. I'll have another watch but I don't recall any figures being given for this though.

Effects at particular locales are going to be dependent on local features, such as terrain, mountains, hills, cloud cover, forest cover, water resources, etc. These more detailed parameters are not part of global climate predictions and cannot be. What are the predictions for Jakarta or Venice? In both cases the cities have subsided. Jakarta because they’ve covered everything in concrete and rains no longer seep into the ground. In Venice they sucked up much groundwater, which made the whole city subside. They stopped doing that, so the subsiding has slowed to 1-2 mm per year on average, but it’s greater on one side than another because Venice sits on a tectonic plate that is being pulled under another. The same model cannot be used to model Jakarta and Venice. The basic model is the same but local parameters need to be included. This is true of every locale.

As Palmer says, the global models of climate are quite accurate in proving the burning of fossil fuels is causing global climate change. Your arguments about subtle changes is not particularly relevant. Various models of global climate converge and are accurate. An example of why this is the case is the Central Limit Theorem. This says that in sampling random independent processes, the averages converge to the Normal probability distribution with a predicable mean and variation. This is how models are verified. You find, by perturbing your parameters, the results still fall within a predictable distribution. If you perturb the parameters sufficiently then one may get a completely different distribution — these are the tipping points. As far your misplaced concern with iterative models. We’ve been numerically solving partial differential equations with millions of iterations for decades. Hell, Richard Feynman and his crew at Los Alamos solved the complex partial differential equations of the atomic bomb in six months using no more than 40 IBM card sorters, something we can do on our home computers today in a couple of seconds.

If one of my students preferred to stand on a soap box and announce that the entire subject is a political hoax rather than learning how to question it competently (which is the entire point of science), then I wouldn't think much of them, it's true. Dissent and skepticism is essential in scientific progress and breakthroughs (for obvious reasons), but so is the rejection of incompetence (for equally obvious reasons). Especially incompetence that pretends it's a critique of science. Why are you pretending they're my models? Why are you pretending I'm happy with things I've never spoken about? Why are you pretending Guardian readers conflate pollution with CO2 levels? Why are you pretending I dismiss Lindzen because of who funds him? Why are you pretending that the fact you're not personally convinced means there's no good evidence? Why not find out? I'm happy for Lindzen to be funded by whoever wants to fund him, it's the fact that he talks bollocks instead of science so often that's the problem. Still, the fact that he's funded by the fossil fuel industry is easier to point out than explaining the science to someone who isn't familiar with it. Especially someone who's managed to make it to 2019 without understanding the basics of the science, despite it being so easily accessible. If you're interested in the medieval warm period, here's a very detailed study of it. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1401-2	UC-Xz0kbedHc6JV9BkSRpbrg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-Xz0kbedHc6JV9BkSRpbrg	1	UgzbZTF_V2wl98Kp9Ud4AaABAg	mlytle0

Can you really not see the difference between being able to see airplanes fly, nuclear power stations produce electricity, and you asking us to believe in your mathematical models? I'm not questioning the physics on which they are based, only your ability to predict what will happen in 10, 20, 100 years time. Professor Palmer himself in the video explained how inadequate these models are and that much more needs to be done to increase the level of confidence we can have in them, and to give them a higher resolution. Meanwhile there are other scientists who question the historical data on which they are based, saying that the higher temperatures in the medieval era have been lowered to give credence to the hockey stick graph. Others have studied the claim that 97% of scientists agree with the IPCC's views on AGW, and think that it's completely bogus. Others, including I imagine most of The Guardian readership, conflate pollution with CO2 levels and people like you are very happy for them to do so. Climate change alarmists are asking us to give government a blank cheque to drastically change the way we live but are too lazy to put up convincing arguments. Instead, you rubbish counter arguments put up by the likes of Richard Lindzen on the basis that he's funded by the fosdil fuel industry, completely ignoring the fact that he was an independent professor at MIT for many years.

I do believe there is an agenda to get western countries to rapidly downscale their industrial output and consumption, which seems unnecessary since these are right now, rather fragile bubble economies more prone to rapid declines in consumption anyway. I think overshoot in deconstructing modernity from a combination of natural economic cycles and elite manipulation is a real possibility. Then there's also people in the social sciences that are gradually working to make them quantitative. This brilliant Russian emigree Peter Turchin, talks about severe political problems in the U.S, (and the West in general) in the 2020's from a variety of economic stresses, a coming revolt against 'hardened' and unresponsive institutions. This fits right into the Global Warming story, because it was a gas tax tied to the Global Warming elite program, that set off the Yellow Vest protests in France one year ago, and these are still going on to this day. One way or another, the scientific community will be shaken by the changes in the societies they belong to, a lot of bad science will get flushed, but the cost to these societies will have been very high.

I remember it being shown to all the senior managers at the blue chip company I worked for at the time. It was treated like the ten comandments being handed down bh Moses. I'm not a scientist but I am logical and naturally skeptical having been in IT for 40 years. I used to program economic models when I was young so I am very verg skeptical about them. The economists used to run them backwards to see what inputs they needed to get the 'desired' results. What really annoys me is the muddling up of testing a hypothesis by experimentation with modelling as though they are the same. I know it's tiring but I do encourage you to keep challenging the AGW views expressed by columnists and commenters in The Guardian. I can only point out that not all scientists agree, but you can argue the points as someone with expertise.

Global warming started as a research topic decades ago, got government funding and went institutional. Thereafter it became self promoting, as the more it was talked about, the more funding it has received. Now in the final stage, it has become an unhinged cult movement. Unfortunate, because to me it represents methodological overreach, promising way more certainty than it can ever possibly deliver. There's a larger lesson here. Back when Western societies were Judeo-Christian, it was a cultural truth that certainty was only within our grasp within narrow ranges, but now that we live in a secular age, and science is God, and scientists have become the new priesthood, it's inferred that if you spend more on scientific models and/or equipment, the god of science will give you whatever level of certainty you're willing to pay for. (Much like leaving offerings at an altar) Science budgets therefore explode, all sorts of extreme programs come into being, become self-perpetuating and political. Real science doesn't grow in these environments, but withers. Real science disappears within a sclerotic patchwork of clubs or cults of 'big science'. That is the unhappy place we're increasingly finding ourselves in.	UCGHlRuITuwxoJ5NOflJgItA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGHlRuITuwxoJ5NOflJgItA	1	UgzbZTF_V2wl98Kp9Ud4AaABAg	mlytle0

The CO2 levels in the atmosphere were 10 to 15 times what they are nowadays for most of the geological record, but they dip to a dangerous low of 180 ppm during the ice ages and at 150 ppm plant life begins to suffocate. A modern return to an ice age would devastate the earth with destruction of agriculture, industry, transport, infrastructure and cause mass migration of people towards the equator accompanied by famine and violence. Give me warming any time, we can deal with that, but not an ice age.	UCc0XHGr3zGVlTfU2NIZs0VQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc0XHGr3zGVlTfU2NIZs0VQ	1	UgzbZTF_V2wl98Kp9Ud4AaABAg	mlytle0

This is a beautiful error multiplication system, unintended, like compounded interest, and is one reason they go unstable and fail after a time. Data must be perfect, models must be perfect, otherwise errors accumulate even faster. 30 year predictions seem pretty ludicrous, actually.. Am I saying Global Warming isn't happening?

Global data of from both satellites and ground observations on a global scale has only now recently (20-25 years) become possible. The temperature data from satellites provides high coverage at some loss in precision, so ground observations help calibrate them. Now, since there are dozens of models, in families, what they will try to do is match this data set as described. This is a fairly small data set considering the long and turbulent history of the earth atmosphere and biosphere. It is of a very short time span covering a rather benign range of a few decades, globally. Though I'm not accusing these people of doing intentional 'curve fitting', which any scientist knows does not necessarily provide a deterministic model, just a good fit which may fail in the future, I think that's what you end up with by the nature of the process. There is paleodata of various kinds, of varying quality, and so forth, but this has not helped them to resolve the dozens of models down to say a handful or preferably fewer. People doing computer models know very well the intoxicating power of having terraflops of computing power, it makes it seem that all things can be subject to scientific reductionism, but I would humbly suggest that the data set we have for all of it's huge size in our terms, is highly unrepresentative of the vast stretches of earth's history. A tight fitting of the data, which in my opinion hasn't been achieved by any one model, is still only matching a very unremarkabe short piece of geologic time.

One one hand you’re just smash a bunch of particles and observe the results, on the other hand you have way to many variables that can affect or even change the outcome.

I thought that carbon dioxide increases followed the global warming trend, rather than the reverse. You need to interview some scientists who have a contrary interpretations of the data. Yes, the models are &quot;attempts&quot;, but do not include all variables. What about the main cause of warming: the Sun and its cycles. Sabine, you are the physicist, check their work, their formulas and models. This is not &quot;settled science&quot;. Question: Is climate changing? Answer: it is always changing.

By heating up the sea CO2 is released which heats up the climate and gives a feedback loop. This is not going on now. Otherwise the sea water would get more alkaline. But the opposite is the case. Other indications of the cause of the current climate change are C14/C12 and C13/C12 ratios, RF measurements of the sun,... . I have never found a scientific article (not disproven shortly after publication) raising serious doubt about the cause of climate change.

He said we create CO2. But he also said we cannot jump to conclusions about what is going to happen exactly. The models need to be more realistic. Currently they are nothing more than models that cannot be accurately projected into reality. The point is about extremes. The extremes are not nearly as bad as they were predicted because we cannot get “local” temperatures right. So we ought not to make bias predictions from poor data. That includes you.

Almost all of the CO2 effect is already covered by the water vapour. So if there was no CO2 in the atmosphere the amount of IR absorbed would be the same, meaning the heating effect would also be the same...CO2 is NOT heating the atmosphere and never has. If you look at the global temp vs CO2 levels over the last 600 million years there is absolutely no relationship what so ever, despite level as high as 7000ppm...!!

We know CO2 forcing is higher at the poles than the equator for example, we know that there are many chaotic variations at a local + global level or global level (e.g. El Nino or PDO). His entire story is based on an unproven and wrong assumption. Very sad to see pseudoscience at places like Oxford.

Climatologists can't delineate how quickly the warming would be occurring minus the human species. Scientists are good at making predictions they can test and measure in a low entropy lab or in relatively short time intervals. Creating models and comparing them to real time empirical data. This is the wheelhouse of successful science. Earth climate models over long periods of time are incredibly complex and climatologists don't even know the multitude of absorption variables they aren't aware of as an example. Remember Chernobyl? Scientists predicted it would take generations before wildlife would flourish in that immediate area again. Turns out the Earth was far more resilient to such things than previously estimated. Think of the massive resources dedicated to short term climate models, better known as: meteorology. The funding and manpower of that industry dwarfs that of long term climatology and yet meteorologists still can't accurately predict short term weather patterns. Long term climate models involve more variables, (or should and don't) and yet climatologists claim to understand the science being conducted. We have been warming since the last ice age and the Earth has been through many rapid warming and cooling cycles in its history. The Earth has spent the majority of its timeline at higher temperatures. Climatology is a racket and if you study the history of science you will learn this isn't the first time humans have been wildly over their skiis in similar fashion. Humans are nothing if not egotistical creatures who believe they have the answers to everything. Throw in a complex issue that can be used to extract money and votes and you have the recipe for mass delusion.

Until scientists grow up they WILL continue to say, "It's worse than we thought". And DUH! If a group is constantly saying that they did NOT do an adequate job.

The same applies to AGW (anthropogenic global warming) Science tries to sit on a high horse in a castle and over complicate what is simple with words like 'Anthropogenic' this in essence is an attempt to appear "smart" Clever people absorb information. Smart people use it in the best possible self interested way. Intelligent people do not give a shit because discovery, analysis and a thought process that is a bit "weird" for most is an unselfish trait. In a way there is a book that clever people can learn from and smart people can exploit...ask yourself where it came from ;-) I do not care if I am in a minority because I invite scientific papers that prove with no counter, that my current hypothesis of +1-+0.01 with a doubling of CO2 is incorrect. It's circumstantial evidence that draws in people from all areas. Monty python could probably do a decent sketch on it.

The words curvature and flatness are just inverse words for the same geometric thing. By the time you get a globe as big as the Earth, the mean curvature of that globe is mathematically flatter than virtually any table top manufactured with the best human skills. Thus, globes can be incredibly flat. Walk into any room with a table, and you can say, "that table is really flat but not as fat as the Earth". And you'll be right. The Earth has less curvature than the table because it's a very, very flat globe.

FFS it's pretty obvious most people are migrating because they are being invited WHICH THEY ARE and/or they see the developed Europe as an economically better place to live rather than scratching a living in the dirt. The irony is, fossil fuel made the 'western' world and EVERYONE wants in. In fact, if you look at globalist agendas, even the UN, they want people living in cities. They want people in office and factories. They want people propping up economies. This has zero to do with climate change. Just so you know, I am an immigrant. I moved from the UK to a south american country where I now live and work. Yes we have a shit economy, and believe it or not, I earn way less money and food is way more expensive but life is so much better. The further you get away from civilization the better it gets.

So cheap. The scientists were wrong in all the history of science, they are still wrong, and will be forever. Scientific progress or "successfullness" is not truth, technical ability is not truth, it's a sophism used too much. Being able to suspend a globe is not being able to predict climate and its consequences, or to know for sure what is the cause of its changes. Climate science is not physics, it is at the other end of the spectrum and encompasses chemistry, biology, and ecology, it is not an exact or hard science.

In this type of subject, non verbal communication is very important, since it conveys sincerity and other pertinent information. The spinning globe distracts the attention from it, and following the principle that riches always lie behind locked doors, I analysed this non verbal communication while hiding the globe. What is striking is that he is very static, with very few gestures, and that says a lot, I let you discover what. This hot subject can easily break a career, we have seen U-turns overnight from scientists who only expressed healthy doubts.

Additionally, the 2009 leaked emails[1] from East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit that show that Michael Mann's "hockey stick" graph was fudged by many respected scientists at the time. Highly disturbing as well is the series of emails that shows how Dr Jones and his colleagues have for years been discussing the devious tactics whereby they could avoid releasing their data to outsiders under freedom of information laws. Does Sabine event mention or present any of this scandal as a counter balance? Of course not... she just chortles about "conspiracy theories" the moment she even detects push-back in a comment. That behavior is yet further evidence and should tell you plenty.

Insults, thumbs up for the insults, one words arguments, and the core of the subject is never addressed. There is indeed a confirmation bias in favour of the human cause of global warming since, and that is factual and can be verified by everybody: there is no study about the production of CO2 by the micro organisms, an effect that could show that the causal relation is the other way round. Prove me wrong! There is a conspiration theory from the climate catastrophists: the climato-skeptics would be negationists manipulated by big corporations that don't want to reduce their CO2 emission. The trick of the globe is a very old one, it is brain washing. It impedes critical listening by attracting the attention, so that the words get directly into the unconscious that has no check, and become a belief.
