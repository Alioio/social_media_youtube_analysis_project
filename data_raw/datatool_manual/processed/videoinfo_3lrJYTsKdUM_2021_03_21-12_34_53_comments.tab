UgyZGw0ESaY32AUDETB4AaABAg	0	0	2021-02-23 04:20:59	What I've Learned	How many of you are familiar with these concepts?<br /><b>Marginal Land vs. Arable Land</b><br />Many people ask why not use the land to grow food for humans?&quot; <b>Because you can&#39;t.</b> <br />-Around 30% of land on the earth is agricultural land (useable for the purpose of making food, the rest is junk).<br />-Take 66% of that 30% of land. That is &quot;marginal land.&quot; <br />- Marginal land is not suitable for growing crops due to soil quality or not enough water etc. So what can you do with it? <br />-You can have cows graze on the cellulose on this land (again, this land is not suitable for growing edible crops), and turn that cellulose into protein and various nutrients humans need.<br /><br /><b>Ruminant Upcycling</b><br />-33% of that agricultural land mentioned above can be used for crops. (Nice.) This is called &quot;arable land.&quot; <br />-Though, for every 100lbs of human food produced from crops on this land, roughly 37 lbs of inedible plant byproduct is produced. <br />-Cows can eat this inedible plant matter and turn it into protein. <br />-Worthless cellulose + Cow = Human Food<br /><br /><b>Biogenic Carbon Cycle</b> in a nutshell:<br />-Methane has stronger warming potential than CO2 so cow burp is bad, right? Well...<br />-Plants capture carbon from the atmosphere via photosynthesis<br />-Cows eat the plant, take the carbon.<br />-Cows burp out the carbon in the form of methane (remember methane is CH4 - Carbon, 4 Hydrogens)<br />-12 yeas later, Methane is broken down back into carbon dioxide via hydroxyl oxidation.<br />*These carbon molecules are the same molecules that were in the plant the Cow ate. It&#39;s a natural cycle. <br />(By the way, the carbon dioxide added to the environment by burning fossil fuels (not part of any life cycle) stays in the atmosphere for 200 〜 1000 years)	UCqYPhGiB9tkShZorfgcL2lA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqYPhGiB9tkShZorfgcL2lA	0

There are so much tasty food out there that are better for you, the environment and the animals you should explore more foods to find out what you like.

The things is if it breaks down fast, then its a super quick fix to reduce our emissions quick. CO2 will last a long time in air, but methane will only last for like 30 years so it will make a huge difference for the environment if we stop eating animals so we can reduce our methane emissions.

UgwHlorBD8svkEN_qtJ4AaABAg	0	1	2020-12-05 20:51:38	Auto Detailing Evolution	The planet can’t support meat-eaters<br /><br />A milions years ago people were vegan before they start to hunt and eat meat.<br />Not everyone can change their diets, thats the problem. Many people arent willing too because they dont care or they have health problems. Instead of cutting out meat entirely we should try to eat less.Some days we can eat meat and some days we can eat vegetables. <br /><br />Giving up meat altogether is not the answer.But we do need to ensure that all livestock are grown healthily with planty of range room and not given hormones or antibiotics.<br /><br />It pains me to see that the beautiful Amazon forest is being cut down for agricultural purpose and snatching away the homes of thousands of indigenous plants,insects,animals and birds. If humanity actually cared about this we could change the future of generations to come. <br /><br />Our consumption habits emit billions of tons of greenhouses gases into atmosphere.<br /><br />The biggest waster of water is the meat diet. Every 1/4 pound hamburger takes 660 gallon of water to produce. Going to a vegan diet is the biggest way each person can cut there water usage. Going vegan also the best way to mitigate climate change. Animal food production is the biggest contributor of green houses gases at 51 percent. Accounts for 90 percent of deforestation, and biggest cause of ocean dead zones. Every pound of meat produced also uses on average one gallon of petroleum to ship, refrigate, and process. Go vegan for the future of humanity, and improve your own health while doing it.	UCtnhMWLbgVOi96iThhd9gPA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtnhMWLbgVOi96iThhd9gPA	0

They do not emit any more carbon dioxide or methane than they take in through grass and other fodder. <br /><br />2. Cattle are not as polluting as fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are dug up from the ground and then burned and go into the atmosphere. It is entirely NEW green house gasses that were previous sequestered deep underground. Cattle does not produce NEW gasses. It converts organic material into meat and waste. Nothing is new. That waste and gasses are taken up by plants and bacteria. That makes it a carbon neutral system.<br /><br />3. Cattle emissions are ground level emissions. They are quickly taken up by plants and bacteria. How else could they grow except by taking up ground level CO2 and other emissions? <br /><br />4. Much cattle production in the US doesn&#39;t require the clearing of forests. They graze in open areas that already exist. Even if areas are cleared this is no different than for any field crop. Perhaps some fruit and nut crops result in some carbon sequestration but that is nothing compared to the forests that existed there before. <br /><br />There are many reasons to not eat meat. Not the least of which is that it is often cruel and wasteful. However, this video falls under the &quot;False Consciousness&quot; rule. They are trying to convince you that it&#39;s really cattle that is causing climate change and not the fossil fuel industry. <br /><br />Make no mistake. The primary threat to our environment comes from fossil fuels and not cows. <br /><br />We could increase cattle production 10 times what it is now on existing grazing and there would be no increase in atmospheric CO2 or methane so long cows would be consuming grass and other fodder as they always have. <br /><br />Finally, much cattle production happens in areas where agriculture is not suitable. The notion that cattle is displacing other types of farms in these areas is untrue. Much of the Southwest is given to cattle because they can graze but have little impact on the other animals in the region. This is absolutely opposite of field crops which require the bulldozing of fields and the slaughter of every animal and plant in that area to make room for one single field crop (like corn, or soybeans). Then that field is cleansed every year with a new slaughter to make room for the next crop and this includes the use of pesticides and herbicides (which aren&#39;t used in cattle industry). In this sense, cattle production is much less cruel than soybean or wheat production. Not only do the cattle coexist with many other animals but also when you eat a hamburger you&#39;ve only killed one animal. Eat a soyburger and you&#39;ve killed hundreds.

For rice, the seed, which is what we can eat, only accounts for less than 10 % of the weight of the plant 3. For coffee, did anyone notice the unit? That is per kg product. How long does it take for you to finish 1 kg of coffee? 4. Anyway, I am not saying beef has less CO2 footprint, but this video is like primary school science: vague definition, poor argument, purely opinions without any supports	UCJxDASKC-kGI56m95qwuV3Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJxDASKC-kGI56m95qwuV3Q	0

Not all soils contain the right nutrients to plant enough crops needed. Moreover, meat is the cheapest protein source you can get, we can see the countries mentioned in the video are not First World countries, so not everyone is privileged enough to buy supplements and crop seeds to change their diet. So unless the people advocating for a diet change decided to sponsor them the resources and technology needed, all of these are just empty talk. <br /><br />That&#39;s why I find it less convincing when First World countries, especially those who had already cut down their own forests, producing even more pollution and had already gained the maximum amount of money that they can from the earth&#39;s natural resources are trying to educate other people on how to care for the environment.

We have too many people on this planet, that's the problem. Here in Montana things are natural, cows roam large open fields, hunting is still a way of life to feed families, life is in balance. Cities full of people who contribute nothing to the natural world are why there are humongous feedlots full of cows, and they tend to be the ones lecturing people like me to go vegan or that our way of life is the cause of thier pollution.

While mega cities are a large part of climate change animal agriculture is a very large piece as well and humans are designed to eat all thing :D and as meat eater my self I don’t think we should stop eating meat we just need to do it in moderation	UCo1FszI9hlTG0MaDJ1iJpmA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo1FszI9hlTG0MaDJ1iJpmA	1	UgzH8hRXrX70HzmpYsd4AaABAg	Austin Lewis

This means that one of the only sources of income and use for the land is cow farming. Obviously statistics in Ireland are very much different from statistics in America but I just wanted to tell people That not all cows are treated badly and many grow on land and white spaces which cannot be used for many other industries.

The animal flesh and dairy industries are the real, scientifically proven reason why our climate is deteriorating at an alarming rate. Switching to a plant-based diet is the quickest way to reduce your own carbon footprint. If not for the animal cruelty, do it for the air our future generations will be breathing.

Ugz96qXCo1VfehUkkyd4AaABAg	0	0	2020-05-20 09:04:05	Philip Vargas	it is not as simple as having people just not eating beef. the consumption of beef is deeply ingrained in many cultures, and without it, many hundreds of millions if not billions of people would lose part of their culture. And according to the UN declaration of human rights &quot;Everyone has the right freely to participate in the cultural life of the community&quot;, which includes eating your own food. This is what a lot of people miss out when talking about reduction in agricultural emissions. The best way to reduce emissions is to always go to the source, not the consumer. We need to find better ways to farm cattle and not just halt it entirely.	UCrBxqhIKkA_YIBgcE46zOLg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrBxqhIKkA_YIBgcE46zOLg	0

UgxvPrVdErx-b5BnTHp4AaABAg	0	1	2020-05-19 06:33:41	isbolga	Actually, there is a misunderstanding about contribution of beef in green house emissions specific to Indian context. The statement &quot;beef industry causes global warming&quot; is only true in West, where there is seperate industrial livestock farming for meat. Those breed are fast-growing high weight-gaining category specially grown for meat. They are not much useful for dairy industry, which has other type of breeds. In India, there is no industrial livestock farming for beef. Almost all methane emissions in India is from cattle grown for milk. Our dairy farmers and farms give them for slaughter only once they run dry (no more able to produce milk) which forms major part of beef supply in India. For small farmers, this is the money they use to buy next cow. In fact, beef consumption in India helps reduce methane emission, because they remove such cattle from population, which otherwise will continue to emit it. Point is, dairy farms are major culprits. If anybody genuinely cares about this issue, the best way is reverse &quot;White revolution&quot; and promote reduction milk consumption.

The world agriculture society as said we have around 60 years worth of harvest left due to the way we have degraded our soil due to poor farming practices such as monocultures where a single kind of crop is grown over and over again with the use of synthetic fertilises and sprays. I seriously encourage people to look up “white oak pastures” they are producing beef and other animal products with a carbon negative out put (which means they are taking more carbon out of the atmosphere then what they’re producing). sustainable agriculture is no longer good enough we need to move to a regenerative agriculture system which needs grazing animals.

If you cut out animals food and implement very simple plot rotation processes you would see massive improvement to soil nutrients. Look up veganic farming as well. That is what a lot of people think is a more ideal method of farming. People need to grow their own food more too.

Globally, beef can be quite impactful, but in developed countries, beef is mostly only raised on marginal land where grain and vegetables can’t grow. Beef in these areas tend to have a positive carbon benefit.	UCP6IS9EHregttu9_1drVyRg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP6IS9EHregttu9_1drVyRg	0

When cattle graze it, it takes a bit of the carbon stored in the leaves, but also makes the plant work to rebuild that eaten bit and if managed properly, will also then build its root system putting carbon underground. Putting a bit of stress on the grass plant like grazing it actually makes it grow more both above and below ground.

For example, people went vegan becuse they&#39;ve seen how cruel food industries were on providing livestock to consume.<br /><br />All this videos are a reminder of how ignorant human beings are to their environments.<br /><br />So how can we fix this? By respecting every thing that you eat, don&#39;t waste your food, do a non-meat day, do a vegan challenge, put more veggies in your diet, and ect. By this, a beef demand will decreased, so as the emissions, and many other good things might happens.<br /><br />Remember, the better world didn&#39;t occur until everyone tooks part of it.

If land must be cleared, aka forests (looking at Brazil here), its a net negative. However if it is to put back nutrients into depleted soil then its great. However most ranching is done for profit and not to restock soil due to "inefficient" land usage (far more land needs to be used if cattle are to graze rather then feed on fodder and grain). As a whole if land in areas where soils are depleted or is subject to desertification then it would help the environment locally. This is due to the land being already depleted you still need to provide feed otherwise the grazing animals will starve. There was a good TED talk about this a number of years ago if you want to search for it.

So one way they could improve the situation would be to impose caps on beef production per producer or land use or something like that.

Mine had more to do with genetic and mental health issues however through help with my doctor I was able to overcome it slowly. One of the biggest helps was finding out how varied and helpful vegan channels on youtube were in giving me meat alternatives or vegetable recipes that weren't at all like the vegetables I grew up with. Just know that there's so many people out there who will be patient and support you through any kind of large dietary change. Never pressure yourself, and just go at your own pace. Think of it as an invitation to a new world of food versus one where you limit yourself. I wish you the best of luck.

Look up regenerative agriculture / Joel Salatin and see how, if done right, cattle farming can actually help the environment and help regenerate healthy soil.<br /><br /><br />Furthermore, this is all a smokescreen to distract us from the real threats i.e. energy, transportation and manufacturing sectors. Look how the air cleared up recently due to people traveling less and factory shutdowns from the corona virus despite people eating more meat than ever.

When has any change in history been like this? I don't think even the most optimistic person actually thinks that everyone will abstain from eating beef overnight. A more likely scenario is a gradual reduction in beef consumption, followed by gradual reduction in the amount of animals being raised by producers. I'm sure this would lead to a gradual change in agricultural business models and cattle would be slowly phased out in favor of other, more sustainable uses of land and resources.

But the idea that pork &amp; chicken are better for the environment unfortunately glosses over the fact that beef is generally free range &amp; pork/chicken are not. We shouldn&#39;t be eating more of those other meats because they are so much more unethical. Also, not many places clear forest for grazing. Texas didn&#39;t.<br /><br />This is why choosing a single issue doesn&#39;t always improve the world.	UCDrw6-bwteExKFuXz6DXzjA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDrw6-bwteExKFuXz6DXzjA	0

Fuel is heavy to carry and also by far airlines' #1 cost. The problem is that current solar and battery technology does not allow enough power to propel an airplane while making it light enough to fly. As soon as that technology is available, you will see a huge transition into green airplanes. Meanwhile, cars, trucks, trains, cruise ships, container ships, all have the technology to change into greener engines, but they don't care.

However, check out biodynamic and regeneratively sourced farming. Those cattle actually help by creating carbon positive environment. Might want to start spreading that info instead of saying all beef is bad. Like many things, it comes down to the choices and practices of the people involved, not the animal. If you want beef, select from a good source. And maybe don’t just “blanket statement” everything like all beef is bad and it’s bad for everyone. That’s uninformed. Look harder.

Ultimately these products would be entirely negligible if we stopped consuming meat, dairy, and eggs. The impact of "sustainable coffee and chocolate" is the same impact as low flow shower heads...it just does nothing...99% of rainforest destruction and all of those issues are from raising cattle and food for those cattle. If we just grew coffee and cacao the same way we grow all the other foods(esp on the lands already destroyed for cattle production) then there would be 10x the room needed to grow those products.

I think I can live without the planet Earth.😁<br /><br />In all seriousness, though, this isn&#39;t just a story about the foods themselves, but also about the mismanagement of resources. It wouldn&#39;t matter if we cut down on beef because what is getting destroyed to raise and prep those animals for food would instead get destroyed to produce some other economically viable product. The people in charge of destroying the rainforest for beef aren&#39;t going to just get better management practices just because the cows are out of the picture. Fixing this requires encouraging or enforcing a change in the priorities of those destroying the rainforest, cow or no cow.<br /><br />By the way, I did &#39;like&#39; the video. It is informational and a decent thought piece.	UCMY6XWMdstTbayRBI4wzVig	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMY6XWMdstTbayRBI4wzVig	0

It was described as the amount of carbon per one kilo, and also as the most carbon producing foods. But if we make 6 times as much corn as beef, would that not change the second meaning. Would love to see a follow up that would include something like yearly consumption (so this is how much carbon each produces in a year). Also, does farming process take into account feed for animals?

Though India has one of the highest number of cows in the world, they're mostly zebu cattle (an indigenous sub-species) and are used primarily for farming activities and dairy products. There is also no large-scale land use change to make cow farms like in Western nations. So, eating beef in India is actually a good thing, we're removing the wasteful individuals from the population.

"India is an equally large global beef exporter, exporting 1,850,000 metric tons in 2016. The country ranks fifth globally in terms of beef production and seventh in domestic consumption. Despite a ban on cow slaughter, as the animal is considered sacred in the Hindu religion, the country's export figures have remained high due to water buffalo meat, also known as carabeef. Carabeef constitutes the greatest portion of the beef trade in India, enabling India to become the world's second largest exporter, accounting for nearly 20% of world beef exports.

The statement "beef industry causes global warming" is only true in West, where there is seperate industrial livestock farming for meat. Those breed are fast-growing high weight-gaining category specially grown for meat. They are not much useful for dairy industry, which has other type of breeds. In India, there is no industrial livestock farming for beef. Almost all methane emissions in India is from cattle grown for milk. Our dairy farmers and farms give them for slaughter only once they run dry (no more able to produce milk) which forms major part of beef supply in India. For small farmers, this is the money they use to buy next cow. In fact, beef consumption in India helps reduce methane emission, because they remove such cattle from population, which otherwise will continue to emit it. Point is, dairy farms are major culprits. If anybody genuinely cares about this issue, the best way is reverse "White revolution" and promote reduction milk consumption.

We can&#39;t be running around with our heads in the sand thinking that getting people to stop eating beef, or chocolate, or whatever is going to fix our global warming problem. Let&#39;s say we axed the top 4 contributors on this graph, we&#39;d just see 4 new ones spike up in their place by process following demand. Purely cause and effect. Nothing comes without cost.

But with the world producing ~700 million tons of rice each year (roughly 10 times the amount of beef), I feel like the actual total amount from each crop should be considered a factor here as well.

Ugy49ie55ylxlEnkXat4AaABAg	0	0	2020-05-16 00:32:38	Jeremy M	Thanks for your informative videos. Doesn&#39;t carbon per calorie make more sense for comparing food source carbon emissions? 1kg of tomatoes 180 calories, 1kg of bananas 890 calories, 1kg of chicken 2,390, 1 kg of beef 2,500 calories. Also, what about regenerative agriculture and the need to use animal feces in order to avoid using fertilizers to gain topsoil and sequester more carbon? What about raising animals on grasslands not suitable for agriculture? Also, animals can be fed bacteria to change there microbiome in order to severely reduce their methane production. There is no doubt that the way most animals are raised not is terrible but a regenerative agriculture model is better for the environment than a vegan model due to the increased topsoil, reduced fertilizers and increased carbon sequestering in the soil. If people are informed about better choices they will demand it and suppliers will fulfill this demand.<br />For water-use, almonds use a lot but they can only grow in a very specific climate. In the US cattle farmers use the same region. If the cattle farmers converted to almond farming then the cattle could be raised in a region with more water and a different climate. As stated almonds and very good for carbon emissions and they can be distributed with minimal waste due to spoiling and have a long shelf life. Most farmers already use drip irrigation. If farmers in the almond regions of the US changed their water use then the almonds would not take the brunt of the water shortage issues in the only regions they can grow. The entire system needs a rethink with a holistic view.	UCUDWk6aQCQENgdRJpyANSmw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUDWk6aQCQENgdRJpyANSmw	0

Yes, you can produce beef in a more environmentally friendly way, but at the end of the day, the population grows and grows. As people in 3rd World countries get richer, they also want more meat. And this demand will not be satisfied with cattle from otherwise unusuable hills. The long term goal HAS to be, to drastically reduce our consumption of beef.

Livestock raisers already have a hard time making money off of live meat the way it is. Anyway, agriculture is an extremely complex process and I don’t expect you or this video to completely understand the entire thing. The video mostly talked about farming beef in the rainforests without mentioning livestock raising in the United States or other parts of the world where we have hilly prairies with rock patches and varying climates that cannot be used to grow crops with current agricultural technology. They actually believe that we could convert all areas used for cattle into rice fields and such when this simply isn’t the case. In fact, cultivating native grasses to make way for other crops negatively impacts the environment. There are certain methods of raising beef that take carbon out of the air but I won’t go into detail. As you know, cattle produce manure. This is a far better alternative for fertilizer than the synthetic chemicals used otherwise. Vox is made up of city people and they don’t care about agriculture or the folks that bust their backs to feed a growing population of unthankful people. If you read all that, thanks.

There were about 50 times more herbivores in the planet during prehistory and it was at its healthiest. They are land managers. The problem is, that we have taken the animal out of its natural and ecological context. All nature is in balance and the pruning of vegetation by these animals actually increases photosynthesis and CO2 and methane sequestration. You should talk about this. Watch some Joel Salatin before spreading WRONG and INCONCLUSIVE evidence.	UCP5j4gHH8BQvPZwKzzvFWHA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP5j4gHH8BQvPZwKzzvFWHA	0

Ugz0VKv8E-dVleUKAnN4AaABAg	1	9	2020-05-15 14:02:57	Ze Jh	my take on this as an agricultural engineering student is that this is a far too complex topic to just make a 5 min video and by the end just basically say &#39;don&#39;t eat beef&#39;<br /><br />While the majority of us should have a more balanced diet and consume less meat, &#39;no beef!&#39; isn&#39;t exactly the conclusion you should come to. I don&#39;t want to type out an essay but the fact that animal agriculture has a bad reputation is only partly based on facts. I am really curious about which sources were used here for example bc in our university most of the stats tell a different story, that beef is contributing to it, but not the biggest cause for climate change.<br /><br />Most of us folks who are active in the agricultural field are trying our best to improve farming practices etc. but most people I&#39;ve met (profs, farmers, vets) aren&#39;t against beef production/animal agriculture. And I&#39;ll take their word over that of youtube channels/news outlets any day.<br /><br />I am honestly a bit surprised about this video bc I genuinely enjoy most of vox&#39;s content. But this is just oversimplyfing a giant system of problems and that isn&#39;t doing anybody any good. So yeah, disappointed to say the least.<br /><br />edit: fixed a typo	UC3JFFBrKWE4RNMip-n16EaA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3JFFBrKWE4RNMip-n16EaA	0

So anyway by buying 80% cocoa chocolate or milk chocolate, it still uses cocoa, which does have a massive impact in the environment. You may opt for organic chocolate or just reduce your chocolate intake the most you can!

People are so quick to think that by individually limited their beef consumption that the problem will be solved, but that just means more waste from irresponsible producers who are trying to get them to buy regardless. The real change needs to come in the form of placing responsible agriculture practices over profit margins. This is a complex problem that needs to be solved by those who created it, not those who will suffer because of it. Couldn't agree more.

The world agriculture society has found that we have around 60 years worth of harvest left due to the way we have degraded our soil due to poor farming practices such as monocultures where a single kind of crop is grown over and over again with the use of synthetic fertilises and sprays. I seriously encourage people to look up “white oak pastures” they are producing beef and other animal products with a carbon negative out put (which means they are taking more carbon out of the atmosphere then what they’re producing). sustainable agriculture is no longer good enough we need to move to a regenerative agriculture system which needs grazing animals.

They still have the same bacteria in their gut and they still release all the same methane gas because they eat grass and are ruminants. There is no difference. You just want to believe that by not eating beef, you are helping. However, the opposite is actually true. By not eating beef, you increase the population of cows, which increases emissions.

Even though milking cows can be used over and over compared to butchering them for meat it's all about the AMOUNT of cows you have standing around. If India just had a few of them your comment would be relevant, but they have loads. So to summarize, it doesn't matter what you use the cow for, it matters how many you got. India is probably the world's biggest emmiter of methane from cows.	UCVry-WuhI5ycyV5SUbAnq5A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVry-WuhI5ycyV5SUbAnq5A	1	UgzU8pYCrfaS93YN7Td4AaABAg	RD Siddarth

Meat is the centrepiece of every meal rather than an accompaniment. A good start would be to at least address this at the fundamental education level. Start with schools. Redefine what a balanced meal really is. Then go after the lobbying industry juggernaut. Now with both demand and supply addressed we can take beef off that list.

Limit child birth thats what the main issue is in developing countries because demand on meat products exceeds supply significantly.. for instance, here in eastern Europe, we can produce enough beef to satisfy our population’s needs, while there are countries like Bangladesh with 160ml and claiming that they don’t have enough food, OH really?

In some countries for example, land used for grazing would otherwise be uninhabitable and not fit for other plants. It&#39;s very easy to look at the really big picture, but keep in mind not everybody buys beef from Brazil, many countries have their own production which sometimes doesn&#39;t the effect the environment as much. <br />But still, beef is bad for the environment	UC-R9yipeNaFLxGv9umZ-bPg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-R9yipeNaFLxGv9umZ-bPg	0

They depended on local ingredients; Fish (Salmon, Cod, Carp, Trout, Eels), Vegetables, Fruits, Nuts, Healthy Fats. They only probably ate things like Beef or Pork as a luxury, like Sausages and Pot Pies. They made Soups and Stews of Hearty Vegetables. In our modern world we consume processed goods and mass produced Fatty meat like (Beef, Pork, Chicken) on a regular basis, which is terrible for us and the environment. Veganism isn’t the answer, we just need to adopt the diet habits of our ancestors before us.	UCcQGADBkuwnQUDDL_sY69uw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcQGADBkuwnQUDDL_sY69uw	0

And yes most Agricultural land is for livestock but this is because most of that land can’t actually be converted to growing crops, large scale crop production is actually harder than most think, and in the US many dairies and ranches that use open grazing tend to convert these areas back into wildlife areas so the cattle actually help the land more than destroy while working with the ecosystem.

Yes, India is three times more populated than USA (Just for comparison). But USA emissions are 22 times higher than India. Per-capital emission of India is one of the lowest India. In over-all history India had been a highly populated country, bcz it can sustain that population. As education and stand of living improves, fertility rate are decreasing. Families having more than two is children is very rare in India these days. For example in my state fertility rate in just 1.6 which is comparable to highly developed countries .

While it is true that Hindus do not consume cow meet, other forms of bovine beef is still eaten, including ox and buffalo meat. Only the cow is considered sacred. However, all three categories are combined under beef. Would be interesting to see the consumption breakdown there. Also, yes India is among the highest milk producers and consumers. No one is ready to talk about the environmental impacts of farming for milk and its products.	UC5HD_9pOW8jTXHjDEHGIndQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5HD_9pOW8jTXHjDEHGIndQ	0

But I think it might give a more honest picture of how polluting a type of food is if you factor in the amount of calories per kg. For instance producing 1 kg of wheat results in more emissions than producing 1 kg of tomatoes. But when looking at how much you would need to eat a day to sustain your needs you need a lot more kg of tomatoes then kg of wheat.<br /><br />A quick Google results in whole grain wheat having 3400 calories per kg and tomatoes having only 177 calories per kg. A more then 19 times difference. This to me at least makes eating wheat a better option then eating tomatoes. When only looking at the environmental impact and not at the amount of micronutrients or fiber.<br /><br />Would love to hear what you think!

Because farms will exclusively grow plants, that leads to soil degradation, the only to stop soil degradation is to rotate crops, with animals. While crop rotation does slow down soil degradation, it doesn't stop it, without using the right crop combination.

There white oak pastures that take more carbon out than going into the atmosphere. So it could somehow be better to be a meat eater. It also tastes SOOOOO much better!

Where was the acknowledgement of mono-cropping produce killing the soil and leading to 50 harvests remaining situation? Where was the graphs showing the massive disparities in food waste, it&#39;s even more significant contribution to GHG, and how meat is the least wasted food? Where was the explanation that methane is a small fraction of total GHG and that it lives in a cycle and effectively dies after 10 years whereas CO2 lives for hundreds? Where was the explanation of how grass fed free range ruminants are GHG sinks and revitalize once dead crop land? Where was the statistic showing that 2/3rd of the earth is unsuitable for crop production but <b>is</b> suitable for livestock? Where was the statistic that the entire US going vegan would have a 3% reduction in GHG produced while fossil fuels create 75% of emissions. Why was the focus on clearing forests for ruminants use not focusing on the governments of those countries allowing it? Where was the explanation that cow fertilizer is a naturally perfect product for growth of natural grassland? This video is intentionally deceptive and damning of one of the single most healthy human food sources there is, and one of the only types of animals that can reduce global warming by simply being alive and doing their thing. Anyone genuinely curious should follow Frank Mitloehner (@GHGGuru) on Twitter to begin learning about the real consequences and contributions of ruminants on our planet and species.

You seem to be in serious denial about this, do you love cheese burgers that much? I like beef as a food but I'm not going to sit here and pretend something is what it CLEARLY isn't. Modern day beef industry has a overall negative impact the environment by any objective measure, and much more so than other meat industries. This isn't even really something to debate, it is clear and well established fact.

Climate change isn&#39;t the only way that animal agriculture and fishing/fish farming harm the environment. All of the nutrients we need in order to thrive can be obtained more healthfully, humanely, and environmentally responsibly from plant sources. Opting for a vegan diet is easier, better, and more compelling than ever. It&#39;s also a delicious way to eat!	UC-o_8LFz750rQZX1TEPt-Dw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-o_8LFz750rQZX1TEPt-Dw	0

I’m just stating it exists because in terms of objective reality killing animals is still possible because it is actual; it does happen. Whether you like it or not. How about lions killing their prey in the wild? An animal kingdom every fish, bird, insect not killing each other as food... 🤯me just thinking about that kind of reality. Honestly it’s pointless to argue with you coz whatever you say or do it doesn’t even matter. It’s for humanity to decide. For your sake just pray humanity chooses to align with your beliefs. Oh and maybe someday in the near future, humanity’s moral code again changes and would argue that all life is important that would include all plant life not just animals anymore then what? Whatever your opinions maybe it sure ain’t definite. Peace out✌️	UCAyjm8KPM_flapBxy8VT0pg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAyjm8KPM_flapBxy8VT0pg	1	UgwkYfvM_y9HhzAsES14AaABAg	Ozan Canca

Many years back people were saying human life is more valuable but now many are saying animal life is just as important. I’m ok with whatever humanity agrees with tbh. FYI your own set of morals is not exclusive to our reality & the world we live in there are many. Kinda selfish of you in a way that you only see things from your own perspective. I guess the perks of having a one track mind; it makes ones life easier.	UCAyjm8KPM_flapBxy8VT0pg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAyjm8KPM_flapBxy8VT0pg	1	UgwkYfvM_y9HhzAsES14AaABAg	Ozan Canca

But you were just hungry! Too bad... Minus 12 points. You should&#39;ve known that people nearly died for these tomatoes.<br /><br />It&#39;s a messed up system, lol. They&#39;re aware. It&#39;s really hard to eat right, but if everyone tried just a little bit harder to eat better and more ethically, I&#39;m actually positive we could slow down the numbers that these companies are producing. It&#39;s something.	UCmV5j6niVmW6tsazoCml18w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmV5j6niVmW6tsazoCml18w	0

It's not at simple as all of us just changing how we eat. industrial farming lets less people farm and more people eat. You want to take a stab at bringing the modern world back the mid-sized farm by being a farmer yourself? People shouldn't have to consider the entire process that lead each and every food item to their plate every time before satisfying their hunger because you were feeling inspired by a vox video that focused on padding exactly one statistic to imply that there is only one solution: to take beef off that graaaaaph by not eating it at alllllll!

The number of parameters that impact the result is complex and can not be this simplified. For example, what level is this measured at (a canned tomatoes has a much higher impact than meat), how is halftime of methane compared to CO2, how is the environment impact from meat compared to other type of production because the benefit of other environmental factor can in turn improve carbon upptake at other places in the natural cycle.<br /><br />With this I don&#39;t mean that beef has a much better carbon emissions compared to the other food stuff, but we really don&#39;t know if it is really this high as presented at many places.<br /><br />There are many many other thing that can be done that we know will benefit the environment today, just what and how we use everyday products, <br /><br />and maybe making charts in the computer than using paper ;)	UCHju_L0EMj4_NJujn8IA6tA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHju_L0EMj4_NJujn8IA6tA	0

Indeed cattle production does emit a whole lot of methane, but it only looks as bad if you aren&#39;t including the other greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide. <br /><br />When you include them all as a whole, agriculture only produce around 8-9% greenhouse gases, which is still considered low if you compare it to transportation (27%) and electricity (35%). <br /><br />I do agree we need to control our consumption of beef. But this video is the typical kind that tries to look down on agriculture, especially on beef cattles.	UCJN-IRnVDI22dAY2hqf_jrw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJN-IRnVDI22dAY2hqf_jrw	0

You never consume 1kg of coffee (but 10g per cup, ie 140-210g a week) while you consume at least 100g of meat for every meal.

A gallon of water for a single almond. 5 gallons for a walnut. Large mono-cultures eventually ruin the soil. You really can&#39;t have plants without animals/insects.<br />Although I agree that the methane cows burp is significant, this is being worked on and cows produce a lot more beneficial products than just beef and methane. A sustainable cow farm (technically a grass farm), produces milk, butter, cheeze, beef (and probably chickens and eggs as part of the process), potentially captures some of the methane for fuel, and has a digester that produces more fuel and significant amounts of fertilizer.<br />The answer isn&#39;t eliminating cows or cow farms, it&#39;s eliminating farms that aren&#39;t sustainable, regardless of product.

We don't have "land use change" as shown in the video. The largest milk producer is probably Amul that is a co-operative of small time dairy farmers. Our milk production doesn't cut down forest land & we don't mass produce cows for consumption. One cow can give milk for almost her whole lifetime but beef only once. Milk production in India is far more environmentally sustainable than beef eating western countries.

Billions of dollars in subsidies keep beef artificially cheap, and dairy companies lobby to have meat and dairy taught as essential parts of the human diet. not saying individual action doesn't matter, but without government action change is rare and slow.

UgzxOp34_8ssa9sWIKt4AaABAg.98dY0LBKyJS98pWZDlWDTb		2	2020-05-19 06:34:02	isbolga	Actually, there is a misunderstanding about contribution of beef in green house emissions specific to Indian context. The statement "beef industry causes global warming" is only true in West, where there is seperate industrial livestock farming for meat. Those breed are fast-growing high weight-gaining category specially grown for meat. They are not much useful for dairy industry, which has other type of breeds. In India, there is no industrial livestock farming for beef. Almost all methane emissions in India is from cattle grown for milk. Our dairy farmers and farms give them for slaughter only once they run dry (no more able to produce milk) which forms major part of beef supply in India. For small farmers, this is the money they use to buy next cow. In fact, beef consumption in India helps reduce methane emission, because they remove such cattle from population, which otherwise will continue to emit it. Point is, dairy farms are major culprits. If anybody genuinely cares about this issue, the best way is reverse "White revolution" and promote reduction milk consumption.

This would be much more helpful, as nuts and grains have many more calories per kg than beef, and can therefore feed more people per kg. Conversely, salad veggies have less calories per kg than beef. Coffee makes over a hundred shots per kg. The only items that are really comparable on this chart are beef, pork, and chicken, which all have similar mid-range calorie densities.

Cows are part of a natural carbon cycle. They eat grass/grain, made of carbon which was fixed from CO2 in the atmosphere. They eat the grass and digest it. They then emit CO2 and methane, carbon which was already located in the grass and is now in the air again to be fixed by plants. It is completely separate from fossil fuel carbon, which is introduction CO2 into the air which had been trapped in rocks for millions of years. The number of cows in the United States has not been increasing, in fact it has been decreasing in the past two decades due to genetics and better management practice. This means that beef/dairy production has actually contributed to global cooling! Also, looking at these systems from a global standpoint doesn&#39;t make sense. Beef you and I eat comes from America, where we literally have millions of acres of ground in the western part of the United States which is too poor to grow crops on but is only adequate for ruminant use (animals which turn stuff we cannot eat, such as grass, into extremely nutritious foods). This one misconception about GHG emissions alone (due to kg CO2 equivalents which are not a good way to compare livestock to other industries) is creating extremely dangerous misconceptions against farmers/ranchers and their products.

CO2eq is useful for a lot of things, but it grossly miscalculates impact from ruminant animals (such as ovine and bovine species) by not considering the fact they're a part of a natural cycle meanwhile fossil fuels and concrete production are not. If you want to learn more look up Dr. Frank Mitloehner, a climate scientist specifically involved in researching animal agricultural impact at UC Davis. He has a lot of great videos that can give a lot more information. He's also on Twitter!

Palm oil, chocolate, and olive oil (a pound of each will last you months if not longer) are being SUPER unfairly characterized against things like pork, milk, and, ironically, beef (a pound of each of these is like a couple meals worth at best).

China is next at 14% (but with ~5x the population), followed closely by Brazil and the EU, both at around 13% (Brazil is ~50% of EU population). Per capita, the ratings change a bit between sources, because different organizations use different standards to measure consumption, but the generally agreed trend is that the highest per capita consumers are North and South Americans (notably US, Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Chile, and Canada) along with Australia, Kazakhstan, Hong Kong, and Israel.

We do however want to avoid global warming from further CO2 emission since that eventually will lead to frozen methane being released from the ground, accelerating the CO2 damage. So overall, methane release and resorption works in a cycle, CO2 release however is problematic since it just adds up and stays in the atmosphere	UC8Jlu6WnL1imDHVM9BRP-DA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8Jlu6WnL1imDHVM9BRP-DA	1	UgxMhiEYpdqzqPPGvw54AaABAg	enerjustics

It also assumes that cattle is fed anything other than grass, which certainly is problematic and we shouldn't do. It would be more effective for the environment to advocate against factory farming practices as opposed to advocating against beef altogether since the restoration and maintenance of natural grasslands with the help of rumenants contributes to carbon dioxide sequestration and replenishment of valuable top soil.

Even if we assume that, i realise these impact calculations are per kg, but especially considering how much milk is needed for some dairy products, I don't see how the difference in impact can be that large. At least in the lower quality sectors of production (which are probably the bulk of the market in meat production) no cow is given much land to graze on, and cows are slaughtered as early as possible, meaning that dairy cows would be living and burping etc way longer. MAybe my very rough and off the top of my head calculations are faulty but then I would say it is certainly a problem with this chart that it is per kg and thus doesn't take consumption into account, because surely people consume dairy products in greater quantities plus more readily and unthinkingly than steaks.

The type I'm referencing are the ones grown from cattle stem cells--not the meat-like vegetable substitutes. It will still be energy intensive no doubt, so eating less of it is still better, but hopefully the switch to renewables will mitigate that issue. That carbon footprint is easier to control than cow burps.	UCIduftyab9urwmSISmWZ8IA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIduftyab9urwmSISmWZ8IA	1	Ugx7ZMxAmwcya6zf2Px4AaABAg	supercheetah

Cutting beef out of humanity&#39;s menu is probably never going to happen, but there are ways we can be smarter about this. the problem is better educating people and passing laws that regulate the food farmers feed their animals, because corn is an extremely cheap thing to feed thousands upon thousands of farm animals, and people will do anything to cut a profit...

Regenerative agriculture shows you can use cows to produce both meat and healthy soil that absorbs way more CO2 than is released. Poor soils used to mono-crop your corn/nuts/wheat are just as bad in wasting CO2 into atmosphere ;)	UC9S6XYwusd4WYT3UjEiiZeg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9S6XYwusd4WYT3UjEiiZeg	0

But many of course will put their enjoyment of eating beef before their own health so it´s not surprising that pollution is even less of a motivation to cut consumption. The state is reluctant to take any measures that reduce domestic cattle industries, but they could put a high toll on imported beef products to discourage its consumption, that would at least reduce pollution from transportation and reduction of some cattle production around the world. <br />If we all just cut our consumption of meat and in particular beef just a few kg each year it could have a huge impact. That would be something like eating ONE meal a week without meat. Or put it another way, ONE meal a week where you feed your body lots of vegetables, pulses, legumes etc.<br />I love beef but we really shouldn´t be eating it as a regular source of protein.

So even though they don't eat the meat they still keep cows and therefore release too much methane anyway.

The takeaway from this information should be that the corporations responsible for most beef production, and thus most of the related emissions, should be forced to change their behavior. Perhaps by drastic measures.	UCWNYS0eDV278AUcLW9qgpuA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWNYS0eDV278AUcLW9qgpuA	0

When we look at things like rainforest deforestation, biodiversity loss, ocean dead-zones, species extinction, etc., animal products contributes the most to all of these variables. Looking at just green house gas emissions is a little bit myopic if we care about our planet as a whole, as it is just one aspect of the degradation of our environment.

We have many places in the world that have had or are facing zero days. In Australia, we have a &#39;&quot;water buyback&quot; scheme for the Murray-Darling Basin (Australia&#39;s food bowl. Which stretches from Queensland through NSW all the way to Victoria). It was meant to be a way of balancing the use of water by limiting the volume of water that farmers could extract from the river. The government &#39;buys back&#39; water entitlements from growers, thereby reducing the amount of water taken from the river. <br /><br />Now you don&#39;t need to be a farmer to own water entitlements, in fact the Chinese and the US are the biggest investors in our water entitlements. The government was caught paying $80 million of tax payers money to company that is registered to the Cayman Islands.<br /><br />Last year during our summer (which is very dry) water stopped flowing in the rivers causing large blue-green algae blooms which starved oxygen to all the fish. Millions of fish were killed and seen floating in the river. While there was a drought and lot of finger pointing on to blame, what we need to remember is that the basin can only support so much. Why are we growing things like cotton, chestnuts and rice? Things that require so much water. We should be growing things that suit our climate. This is why a follow up video to this one but about water usage I think is important for people to know.	UCbBSoU1fGs0EVjya7ADYhkg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbBSoU1fGs0EVjya7ADYhkg	0

But then again we’d have to be willing to eat native Australian plants. I understand we don’t have to choose only Australians produce, but it seems it would make sense as opposed to water intensive species or even more foreign plants/species that may be suited for the climate but have a destructive force on the current ecosystem.

I don't know the numbers, not an expert. Of course if we stopped eating beef for example more of other water consuming food would have to be produced. The question is what is the equasion. Which industry would use more water. Your comment is insightful but things always expand further. My conclusion always ends up on an argument that land is not to be used as we use it.

I was an ethical vegan for 10 years. Vegetarian for 14. <br />I&#39;m not alone. Restricting food groups is one main of the characteristics of eating disorders. <br />A lot of people suffer from eating disorders. And being vegan is a good way to disguise it. I was proud to do what was good for the planet. I was dying. (A few vegan would say that is a good thing, that people are just a nuisance to life).<br />I think that reducing rather then eliminating is the answer. Eating better quality meat, less often.

I have 85% cacao choc and I sometimes eat a piece (10 grams), definitely not more. For reference, in the EU milk chocolate is >25% cacao and pure is >35% cacao. If you eat much chocolate it's more likely to be a chocolate-flavoured sugar craving than actual chocolate :p.

UgyCCz8hUmXnwiFmsbR4AaABAg	1	3	2020-05-13 21:43:13	Banana Pudding	Not consuming animal products is definitely something that we should all take up, however minimally... but I think that there&#39;s a myth to the &quot;our&quot; and &quot;we&quot; when we talk about destroying the planet. As much as we have the agency to change our diets, the truth is that the corporations in charge of these industries are the ones responsible for producing carbon emissions exponentially over the past few decades. We cannot keep convincing ourselves that being conscious of what we eat is enough, but rather being conscious of the systemic exploitation of the land/people that <b>really</b> explain why we&#39;re in the state we&#39;re in. The truth is, not everyone will go vegan, but everyone can consume foods that are grown and produced locally and sustainably. I care about climate change, but the people with the real power to change things simply do not–that is the problem.

If people aren't buying a certain product the producers aren't going to produce more of it. i.e if people stop buying beef the ranchers are gponna stop breeding cows into existence. They aren't going to breed animals they can't sell. The power is with the consumers on this one.

However, if you look at a graph of those changes over time from Earth's beginning, you'd see the scope of the damage and the DRASTIC climate change starting at the industrial revolution and increasing alarmingly in just the last two decades.

That&#39;s because I went vegan for the wrong reason, we need to go vegan to end the torture and suffering of 200 million animals every year, they are sentient and feel pain just like us. When I realised this is when I fully committed to going vegan. Going vegan does wonders for your body and the environment, but that should only be seen as a silver lining.

A lot of us could cut down on air travel, which would have a much greater impact. Only if you average climate-change causes out over the entire population, that air travel isn&#39;t the biggest factor anymore - because a lot of people simply can&#39;t afford it. But if <b>you</b> can afford air travel and you use it, cutting down on that is the single biggest factor you can contribute towards a better climate.

If we only have 40 to 60 harvests left due to poor quality soil (like some have claimed), how is this not something that should be pushed forward?

Mostly because if food x is more environmentally friendly and it can feed 10 people per kg and another food has the same emissions but can only feed one person. Since the kg amount that feeds a person usually follows the 2000 kcal per day recommendation.

So I am asking you to give me the source you used so I can see and hear what convinced you. Those animals produce the same amount of CO2 and methane no matter how they are raised. Those gasses can store a lot of heat on them. Ofcourse it cuts down the emissions in for example their food intake since they are eating mostly stuff from the ground beneath them. But then again do trees etc need to be cut down to create more land for the animals to live in. I would also like to see how exactly they calculate their emissions.

Sounds hard to believe, where is all that extra energy coming from? It likely doesn't use synthetic fertilizers to grow meadows (so less grass), but you can keep thrice the number of cattle on it? I love the concept, but I don't see how this works unless you dump an equal portion of human waste on those meadows. And even then I doubt natural composting is fast enough.

We are trying to get people to drive less and opt for public transport but no matter what we say or do it will always come down to the people themselves and big corporations. We cannot change the law by ourselves with the snap of a finger, we need politicians and more people to support the idea of a livable planet. In theory it could be possible to move cattle from South America to Alberta. But that is only in theory. In reality lands like Alberta couldn't handle the amount of cattle we are currently raising. It would also limit biodiversity if we were to only raise cattle in a sertain enviorment. There would also be logistical problems like where would all the food for cattle be produces and how much emissions would it produce with transportation included. There would also be the problem of antibiotic resistanse wich is growing at an alarming rate the more we consume animal products. Those animals are pumped full of meds to keep them from getting disease. Around 85-90% of the worlds antibiotics are used within animal agriculture. Those same animals are still creating greenhouse gasses like CO2 and methane when they are alive. At this rate we are raising and killing millions of animals per day just to keep up with the demand for meat etc. It doesn't matter where they are raised they still weaken biodiversity everywhere wich also contributes to climate change. We know that raising cattle and dairy cows is someones livelihood but should it be? Animal agriculture is the least sustainable diet to keep up no matter how you try to twist it.

You can compare that to how long 1 kg of rice will feed you, or 1 kg of potatoes. 1 kg of coffee, doesn't feed you at all (I mean, you can try, it is edible, but it isn't good for you). Coffee is more of a lifestyle choice than a food source, it just so happens that you make coffee by farming, rather than mining or something.

If you put them on scrub lands like we have in Alberta then not so much. When is the environmental movement going to go nuclear on ethanol.

Growing and consuming plants takes up less space and produces less emissions over all. We would need globally around four times less land than we currently use for agriculture if we were to all go vegan or vegetarian and that is if we were to feed every single person on this planet.

It probably won&#39;t be every time but I&#39;ll do chicken burgers and pork in the chili and stuff like that, and of course look at good meatless dishes.

I get the first part, but how are lands being reforested by a passive action? Are ranchers planting trees as their ranches close?

There are some ways that grazing is good for the ecosystem but in most cases, it's not just that trees are being cut down but also that the soil deteriorates even further. Letting nature do its thing solves a lot problems.	UCm6xXXeHff0Jtoo0xBLHdyQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm6xXXeHff0Jtoo0xBLHdyQ	1	Ugy7tXoLFn37TOIYfip4AaABAg	Brian Loper

They mention in the video that some veggies and nuts have a negative land use impact because you grow them on trees.

Just because few groups in the society eat them, doesn't co-relate to them being vedic. Also cow had a special place in India society, not just because of religious reasons, but for farming, milk, fuel source, also as a pet.

The only reason you eat them more slowly is because you are bulking out your diet with rice/wheat/chicken etc. Now, for a truly fair comparison you'd have to assign each food a kind of overall nutritional score to get a comparison of food value vs environmental damage, but that would be a mathematical nightmare, comparing protein vs carbs vs vitamins and trying to come up with a single number.

With the exception of broccoli, all are animal products, and you can see a big jump from the lamb and beef to turkey. (Units are kg carbon dioxide emitted per 1000 calories).

To be able to produce milk they have a baby that is killed for meat every year. Before heading to the slaughterhouse themselves because their body is tired after all these babies and don’t produce enough milk. So every year you get one cow killed + 1 the 5th year.

It is impossible to have milk without also farming cows. If you want to have them “produce milk throughout her lifetime”, you have to impregnate the cow regularly. Being pregnant all the time is not sustainable for the cow, hence they usually get slaughtered a couple of years into their lives, when they don’t produce enough milk anymore (because their bodies just cannot do it anymore). It might be better, but a nutmilk or an oat milk is much, much more sustainable, and that all without the associated animal cruelty, like forced impregnation.

In case you hadn't paid attention to the clip, here is the time stamp 2:45 Pay attention on the land use change point, which is the second biggest contributor for such large emissions from the beef Industry. Most beef farms or Ranches clear out large section of forests to rear these animals on Industrial scales. Indian dairy industry on the other hand is largely reliant on Milk cooperatives where small or medium sized farmers who generally own 1-10 cows or buffalos deliver milk to dairy agglomerates or cooperatives like Saras, Amul etc. There are no significant industrial scale milk farms that change land use pattern. Cows are usually fed straw (bi product) from the farm or left to graze in open grasslands.

We should hold our governments accountable for not charging them criminally for their contributions.

How much money is in the cattle industries? Could a large tax on beef be a solution to reducing consumption? How this differs in economically developed country’s from less economically developed countries? If we stopped eating beef would we starting eating other foods that’s ecological impact would become significantly worse?

If people stop eating black beans the bean farmers are also gonna go out of a job. Truth is we shouldn't let that decide what we eat. And your last point doesn't make sense, because they just explained that beef is the most damaging food to the environment. i.e everything we substitute it with would be better.

However, please look into intensive silvopasture (agroforestry practice) combined with diversified perennial prairie grasses. Project Drawdown identifies this practice as one of the best ways we can mitigate climate change from CO2 and GHG emissions. We eat too much meat but tilling the ground every year for grains and vegetables is also unlikely to resolve our issues. A diverse application of regenerative farming and agroforestry practices (including livestock management and consumption) is more likely to benefit the Earth and feed more people.

The cows that are not capable or out of their milk producing capacity are the ones that are sent to slaughter house. Considering the fact that there is no industrial size cow farming nor cows bought up just for the sake of meat, India is better compared to what Brazil is doing.

Like one of the comments says, cows have been around for a long time and humans have been eating them for a really long time too. The problem is how animal farming is done. <br /><br />I think first we should reevaluate how we farm these animals and how the carbon footprint for these processes can be reduced. A lot of people rely on meats, especially beef for nutritional purposes as well as just eating it for its taste. <br /><br />The majority of this video is criticising the farming processes so why would you conclude that we should just stop eating beef altogether! At least make a comment on finding better ways to farm or carbon recapture. There&#39;s loads of other things to say/conclude from this video than the one size fits all that you&#39;ve done.

Let us all collectively bully factories into behaving themselves and complying, use public transport, etc and reduce c02 emissions...

Because there is a big difference between intensively reared cows in the US and organic farmed cows in Ireland for example. Or how about the cows in India that just roam and chill and seem quite low maintenance. Or what about sustainable ranching practices? <br />I feel like dismissing cattle because they belch is a dangerous oversimplification. Reducing some farming practices is one thing, but ruminants are actually a very important part of many ecosystems and getting rid of them is not the answer either.

Congo, Indonezia and others that have large rain forests in their terytories would be declared &quot;Custodias of the planets lungs&quot; or other fancy and symbolic term wich would practicly mean that they should be recipients of funds from a global tax. Green house gas emmiters and countrys (based on how forested they themselves are) will pay it. Also, these countrys mentioned above should also get certain rights and privileges like exclusive rights to planting carbon absorbing crops, or green technologys like harvesting methane from cow ranches and others.<br />I am sure and aware that the exampes I came up with are full of problems and that many would dodge that unpopular tax &quot;on breathing&quot; but what I am trying to say is that we need a way to reward and insentivise countrys that have such important assets like forests to keep and grow them. To not punish their economy without giving them anything in return.	UC81M5RN29bzcL0HfcMmgwlw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC81M5RN29bzcL0HfcMmgwlw	0

It doesn&#39;t make sense! <br />I live in Indonesia where 14,3 million Hectares are use for palm oil plantation and most of it are peatlands. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lrJYTsKdUM&amp;t=3m38s">3:38</a> it&#39;s a peatland in Indonesia. They&#39;re draining the area for palm oil plantation not for chocolate. Peatland are wetlands whose soils consist almost entirely of organic matter that are not fully dacayed because it&#39;s too wet to decomposet. The wetlands store vast amount of carbon, twice as much carbon as all the world&#39;s forests. Clearing and draining the peatlands causes the opposite effect. Causing huge greenhouse gas emissions and also making wetlands vulnerable to fires. It happened last year. Most of the time they just burnt the lands causing more emissions. So the land use change in Palm oil it&#39;s supposed to be much much higher.	UClI5v-uHVpqA7inS4KYHDZQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UClI5v-uHVpqA7inS4KYHDZQ	0

You don't NEED coffee or chocolate to exist. Just like you don't NEED beef, dairy, chickens, etc. If someone is starving and hungry they will gladly eat rice and broccoli. All essential nutrients can be obtained from those two foods. You don't need to do a lot of things, that we consider a part of our daily lives.

When cows have a diet of pasture grasses instead of corn and grain, they produce far less methane. They also have the opportunity to support grass root growth through grazing which sequesters carbon. I agree that humans should eat less beef, but I also think they should eat better beef. Please consider supporting local organic cattle farmers. There are people out there doing it right, and eating beef can be a positive thing to support them and the environment. Another thing to think about is the fertilizer cows can provide in a positive farm system. If we hope to move away from chemical fertilizers which contaminate land, water, and wildlife we need to pursue sustainable fertilizers. Cattle can contribute to this system with their manure. Overall this issue is incredibly complicated but the most important thing to realize is not all cattle are raised equally (both environmentally and ethically) and it’s possible to be an active consumer and choose good beef!

There is the issue of energy production--you are somewhat correct on that. This plants do use fossil fuels. But guess what? The assumption lab-grown meat will always produce more CO2 than regular meat is just wrong. Why? We will not always use fossil fuels. Energy production can be solved. Lab-grown meat in plants powdered by solar or nuclear to reduce emissions further? Sign me up for that.

I&#39;m not sure how well that would sit with people who are driven to veganism because of environmental reasons. Hrm.<br /><br />Perhaps a better way would be to illustrate not just a CO2 per KG of product but a measure of how many KG, on average, of a product we consume ... as it takes people some time to go through a couple of pounds of chocolate or coffee, but considerably less for pork.

A kilogram of beef for example only comprises about 4 individual steaks, whereas a kilo of coffee beans can stretch to make around 100 cups of coffee. Even though coffee or cocoa might contribute about a quarter of the greenhouse emissions as beef per unit mass, we typically consume (and thus produce) these foods in quantities much lower than products like meat or fruit or grains, and so their relative impact is actually less than this in practice. The same can be said of foods like olive oil or nuts, which are calorie-dense. So enjoy your morning brew!

Roughly 2 or 3 years ago, she developed a red meat allergy. Like, even a bite will have her very sick. I'm guessing there's a certain point where the enzymes won't, or can't come back. Obviously, age probably plays into it, but I wouldn't be surprised if people couldn't even handle small amounts to take it in slowly.

While I cannot know for certain, I do not think you are actually allergic to beef. I'm a vegetarian, I have been since I was three years old, so I haven't eaten any meat or fish for a solid amount of time. And of course, because of this, my body doesn't produce enough enzymes and stuff to actually process and digest meat. Thus if I tried eating a hamburger right now, I'd end up extremely sick. However, there have been a number of vegetarians and vegans who at one point stop being vegetarian/vegan. They also end up being sick if they don't GRADUALLY add meat back into their diet. Your body, unless you are truly allergic, still has those enzymes to digest meat, just not enough of them by a long shot, and thus you'll end up making yourself sick. So people trying to get back into eating meat, have to do it very gradually, its a process because you are basically teaching your body how to digest meat again. Of course, I can't know if you are truly allergic or not, nor are you required to actually go and eat meat again, but I've seen enough people think they are allergic to meat when they really are just adding it into their diet too quickly.

The important thing is whether you are doing a good thing or not. The rest are secondary. You however are creating statements about results and changes that would come about if this or that happens. Especially with the statement "imagine if 10% of the world thinks like me." Doesn't strike to me as a realist.

Your own actions is the most important thing, not the actions of other people because the actions of other people are not up to you. You should keep that in mind.

It’s a complex issue and we need to be looking at a range of things, like population growth, agriculture methods, supply chains, etc etc. By simplifying a problem you’ll only end up with a solution that won’t work.

Once you've educated the public, more and more people will avoid beef and the beef burgers in McDonald's would lose market share, making them consider more alternative options. It doesn't take much, if everyone watching this video skips out on beef for something else, there will be a dent in McDonald's P/L statement every year and they will change the menu.

People would stop buying their food and you know, McDonald’s would lose money. It’s just not that simple.

I see what you're thinking but say 250 calories of beef/lamb/pork/chicken etc is not comparable to 250 calories of broccoli/tomatoes/lettuce etc. Many people could and do eat 250 calories of animal products in one siting, since the volume of food is pretty small. 250 calories of vegetable is an awful lot of volume and no one eats that much all at once.

It has existed way longer then the using of fossil fuels, so if farming was having a big affect on the planet, global warming would have started to increase parallel with farming but it did not. A better alternate is to think about the affects outside of the cycle, and try to source local goods instead of shipping goods from around the world. The more local the product the better it is, as it is the products that have to be shipped (cocoa products, cheep meats and unnative crops) that have the damaging affect on our planet. But is local farms are not supported then it will be the larger, more intensive and inhumane farms that survive and replace the smaller farms that are not aible to compete.

Fruits and vegetables are expensive, and it can be time-consuming to make meals out of them. A lot of poor people don&#39;t have that kind of money or time. Meanwhile, you can get a burger from McDonalds for a dollar. I don&#39;t eat beef that often myself, but it&#39;s irresponsible to act like a person&#39;s diet all comes down to personal choice.

Considering that cheese has a bigger impact than milk due to the extra work for fermentation/aging/etc, I assume raising a cow for milk is much more efficient than slaughter.

It seems to me that the 28% is the average % of a person's emissions that are due to food production. If that's the case, then the only way to achieve 28% reduction is to not eat anything! Obviously this is impossible. From memory, I think that a vegan diet only emits about 30-35% of a beef-heavy diet (don't quote me), if that helps? So if I'm right you could probably knock 10-20% off your personal emissions, depending on how much beef you eat and your other personal lifestyle factors.

And then compare it to cacoa trees which you call deforestation. Citrus plantations also need a lot of water. So like with coffee. Take chocolate from ecologic farming. Often combined with permaculture, so food sources among the trees for the families that work there. This is already reality. Eco is more expensive, but worth the money.

In the US it's worse. The problem is this is hard to change as it is very cultural and sort of a taboo discussion. I don't believe it accounts for a big % of human emissions though so probably not a priority.

We&#39;ve seen in just a few short weeks of the Co-vid crisis how immediate of a reduction of greenhouse gasses/smog/pollution can be had when people drive less. I&#39;m pretty sure that if I do that - get rid of my car, and walk, bike or take the bus/train even if I eat 1 hamburger a month the world will be better off than if I keep driving.

I'm responding to how the information is presented in this video/description which seems to be heavily suggesting that a small change in diet can be more powerful than any other decision (including transportation), but that math doesn't check out... I checked. It also has many assumptions. Most people drive everyday, very few people eat beef everyday. And what if I eat beef once a week? or more realistically once a month? There are many assumptions in this data. Certainly, less is better but I'm highlighting that large change is more than just minor reductions. It's about making serious lifestyle improvements that shift the conversation drastically - again, a drastic transportation adjustment, like we've recently witnessed, will most certainly be more beneficial than a very minor diet adjustment, and both - great!

A dairy cow can produce more products so naturally, while the emissions from the cows itself may not differ much, the emissions per product per weight is going to be different.

They should have included a total dairy bar since 1kg of beef at the end of the life of a cow is not comparable to 1kg of milk throughout the life. And you cannot have the milk without having the cow emissions that play into the dairy beef bar (I guess you could throw away the beef but then it would just be wasted and it wouldn't change any of the emissions leading up to that point). That's why I'm saying you cannot look at the low milk bar while ignoring the dairy beef bar	UCD81rP2oL3vuKVSSu_-YLjQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD81rP2oL3vuKVSSu_-YLjQ	1	UgyykmHJgOF0dTdZKxh4AaABAg	Josua Krause

It just gets distributed across more products. And you can see that cheese is right up there with dairy beef. My initial complaint was about this splitting up since it hides the total impact of dairy products (since the emissions are distributed across those products) which would otherwise come close to non-dairy beef. You cannot look at the low milk footprint without also looking at dairy-beef and cheese since you would not have milk without those cows.

Dairy cows and beef cows are rared differently, so it's only natural they'll have different bars. A dairy cow can produce a lot of milk over it's life time, so of course it's emissions per kg of product will be much lower than beef, since you know, a cow can only be slaughtered once? It's not hard to figure out, it's even easier to click on the source in the description that explains everything.

And, additionally those two bars are far shorter than the beef bar. So if I read the graph drinking milk has almost no impact whatsoever (going by the milk bar alone) which completely ignores where the milk comes from (that would be the other bar) and on top of that the dairy bar is less than half of the beef bar without any explanation. So please enlighten me	UCD81rP2oL3vuKVSSu_-YLjQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD81rP2oL3vuKVSSu_-YLjQ	1	UgyykmHJgOF0dTdZKxh4AaABAg	Josua Krause

For example, I drink lactose free daily milk - not a huge fan of almond milk. I wonder how impactful it is, additionally, to then process milk to remove the lactose. Or, are the emissions of those steps already included/calculated in this graph/information.	UCG3sDf8-fcQ4NdB4Le5neSQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG3sDf8-fcQ4NdB4Le5neSQ	0

Biogenic methane is much less important to climate change since it was initially excracted carbon from the atmosphere on a short timescale and is converted from methane to carbon dioxide by solar radiation. The rate of generation has a marginal effect on the equilibrium concentration (not as relevent as a process that creates accumulation) however changes in land use may have also decreased the natural rate of methane release by the biosphere for example from coversion of wetland to farmland. Wetlands, without the presence of higher than normal concentrations of sulfates, release a large amount of methane.

Still vertical farms are more possible with this than meat based products. I care about the planet yet I still enjoy meet. Eat in moderation, don&#39;t throw away food and make sure your plate is clean. Do this and you will help the planet. Fast food like McDonalds are another great contributors to all of these problems. More importantly, we need to start building in space, the more carbon is offloaded to space, the better. We don&#39;t need factories down here.<br /><br /><br />It&#39;s not matter of stopping, its a case of learning how to utilise the negative.

Measuring the circles in paint and doing some napkin math: r1=0.33", r2=2.92", so r2/r1=8.85. Applying A=pi*r^2, A2/A1=8.85^2=78.3. So what happened? Theory #1: they didn't half 21 when doing the calculation, using diameter instead of radius. Check: if r2a=0.5*r2=8.85/2=4.425, then A2/A1=4.425^2=19.6. This is close enough to 21 that given human error in measurements, theory #1 stands as a definite maybe.

This means that it’s diameter should be 1/(21^0.5) times the diameter of the yellow circle, which is roughly 1/4.5 . The diameter of the yellow circle is 4.5 times the diameter of the green circle.

UgyDDQvHvvM0um5SPAl4AaABAg	0	5	2020-05-13 14:30:48	Taté Suárez-Llanos	The real solution (in my opinion) to the beef problem is not to say ‘Don’t eat it’, because although some of us try to reduce our intake or even eliminate it completely, there are other people that are not willing to do it and they have their right to do it, so the wheel keeps turning in favor of big corporations. So in the end, even though it is a good action, it is not addressing the real problem. What we should do is DEMAND A CHANGE in the way beef is raised and produced, so we address the real problem. <br /><br />If you want some information and you care about our soils you can find interesting some of the following topics/examples: regenerative agriculture, the savory institute, Rodale institue or just permaculture. Also great examples are Joel Salatin, Joyce Farms, Charles Massy or Stoney Creek Farm. Maybe you have a farm near where you live and you can take action. Buying beef from this kind of farms is the best way to change practices and habits in this industry. Cows, bison, etc.. can actually be one of the best tools we have (along with biochar) to store carbon in our soils and reverse climate change.<br /><br />But I’m not saying let’s eat a cow a day so we can reduce climate change, I’m saying reduce your intake and we you actually buy beef try to buy it from regenerative farms (local being the ideal).<br /><br />Hope this is useful for someone. Have a great day.	UCAfd39eHbHviho8oNxXmkUg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAfd39eHbHviho8oNxXmkUg	0

One is methane deposits in the seafloor that are being released. Also, as arctic ice melts in Siberia, Canada, and Greenland methane deposits from the permafrost underneath is being released. Finally, in the US, the rise of fracking has resulted in the fracking process leaking lots of methane into the atmosphere. NASA has tracked a huge rise in methane emissions from what's called the Permian Basin, which is the land in the midwest US where fracking is the most prevalent. Methane is probably a big contributor to the reason why global warming seems to be happening faster than predicted. If you just use CO2 in the predictions and leave out methane, you will get less warming which takes longer to reach tipping point levels. But add in the methane, which doesn't last as long but makes the temperature rise more quickly, and you have a real problem that is growing faster than expected.

In fact, what we call cows (aka Bos taurus), has only existed for a good 10 thousand years or so.

Farming 1kg of lettuce produces fewer emissions that 1kg of chicken, but the chicken will feed way more people. I say this as a vegetarian of 25+ years. It will definitely be a huge benefit to the world if everyone ate lower on the food chain more often, but this overstates the case a bit. We will need way more total tonnage of food to feed folks /w vegetables compared to animal protein.	UCAQ8Olv5m9YfdLB5UFnmq1w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAQ8Olv5m9YfdLB5UFnmq1w	0

Any company that produces products that go to the consumer can be boycotted by just not buying their products anymore, or any products that contain ingredients from those companies. We, the people, can have more of an impact than you might think. The problem, however, is that most people refuse to give up any of their comforts. We can make a difference, not as individuals, but as a society. I don't think that's ever going to happen, though. And governments aren't going to do much either, because they are being heavily influenced, manipulated and even bribed by big corporations. It's a vicious cycle that will lead to the inevitable collapse of society in the coming decades.

There are studies out there that agree with you (to a certain extent), that you can cite. Waste is but one part of the problem, you could probably throw away 90% of your lettuce and it'd still be less impactful than beef. I don't know about your city but there are plenty of cities that do collect food waste and turn into animal feed or compost.

People surely don&#39;t consume the same weight for all of these foods. For example, coffee is high on the scale but people consume it in such a small amount that&#39;s it&#39;s impact is negligible. I&#39;m all for saving the planet but I think we need to give people better data then this.	UCJkFWlBlHDE6NtlW_ZQSZCg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJkFWlBlHDE6NtlW_ZQSZCg	0

No government or regulatory body keeps track of calories produced or exported. They do constantly track kg exported though. Also not all parts of an animal are equal in calorie density. It's just gets too complicated per calorie and doesn't provide much more benefit to the understanding of the problem at hand.

Yes, veganism, conscientious eating, and the like are all significant movements that do have some effect, but you wont have changes to farming practices for years after that public change. You need forced regulated instructions to change farming practices if you want a relatively immediate solution. Hopefully whichever team is in office (US domestic) regardless of political view decides that this is something that is high on the list and easy to develop new farming regulations.

In the grand sceme of things it could be better to eat less pig than beef because we consume a lot more kg of pig than beef. I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s the case but based on this chart you cannot say that eating no beef is the best solution...

If farmers produce 10 KG of Beef but 1000KG of pork than pork contribute more to climate change than beef. Its not explained but the video implicates that we should stop eating beef which might not be the case since a lot of people eat much more pork than beef.

UgyjmgVeBb36wb4FBFR4AaABAg.98apodkfR5P98aw0HtBnda		0	2020-05-13 14:36:35	-	• Cheese gets a separate bar because on top of milk's emissions, it makes more from processing it into cheese. • The milk bar is milk from non-cow sources (which is actually rare outside of North America), so it's low. • Cow-milk, which is a mainly western thing, requires cows plus processing, which is why it's so high. • Beef also requires cows, but also requires a lot of extra processing which further increases its emissions. • One cow can produce milk repeatedly, but it can produce beef only once, hence beef is so much higher than milk.

Consider the resulting covid 19 pandemic nature’s revenge for our mistreatment of the planet.

It still won't make that much of a difference if it is implemented on top of some of the measures I've mentioned. It is just insignificant. Additionally, when you force people to follow such useless rules, people simply won't comply which will create other problems. I don't think people would be happy to forcefully go vegetarian. Anyways, I think we agree to disagree because I can see this debate going forever haha. I enjoyed debating with you, mate. Have a good day!

UgxdFZSaeGyIK0XuZSh4AaABAg.98aoYpQWtiU98b6Exo4xow		0	2020-05-13 16:14:43	Marvin Jung	@Red User Of course actions by governments most often harm the individuals freedom, and that indeed is an important counter argument but politics, especially in ethical questions like these, allways is the balancing of different aspects and interests, meaning that in this case freedom is rivaling with solidarity and the protection of nature. You can come to the conclusion that the positive in this case does not outweigh the negatives, I would differ, that is something everyone will have to answer for themselves. But I do think that most people, at least in my home country, actually do support such measures making specific products more expensive, that has been shown by several surveys. It is thus, in my opinion, an acceptbale solution if, and that is important, you make this solution work for the ones not being able to have the choice do buy higher priced goods because of their lack of income and wealth, meaning once again the social compensation I mentioned. Normally I´d say you were right, freedoms shoudl be protected even against the general common good, in this case though the climate crisis is of such importance that, as I said, even these more darstic measures have to be taken. And I do think that it would make quite a big change if you pair it with several similar mesaures, as it has been said in the video the emissions by this sector makes up, if I remember correctly, nearly 30% of the averages persons emmissions, a factor quite easy to lower.

Besides, it wouldn't make that much of a change. I also think that it would unrelate the focus from the bigger problem and it would discourage further people from supporting the movement since they would see it as tool for the government to intervene in our personal lives.

What I now meant was that, because of the climate crisis being one of the most serious problems humankind will ever face, we should implement every serious measure as soon as possible, at best right now. Why do you not support disincentivizing such behaviour? To direct behaviour by several measure, incentives and disincentive, is a common practice used by governments and one ceartainly needed in this situation. The negative effects included in such measures, especially the social ones mentioned by me before, can be avoided.

Just 100 companies are responsible for 71% of global emissions after all. The problem is that some countries *ehm ehm* China *ehm ehm* won't do anything and in fact, since implementing such measures can scare off investors, China actually does more harm than good.

The costs are astronomically high (pun intended). It needs to include compensation for the rockets to travel back and forth, the fuel, and the food for the animals and don't forget about water and the whole wastewater management, it would be a mess. Just google how much it costs at the moment to move 1 kg of mass into space, it's huge. Sorry to disappoint you though, but no one would ever even think about that due to the high expense.

The CO2/Methane isn&#39;t emitted the second you buy it, it already was emitted.<br />Just not buying foods that contribute to global warming isn&#39;t enough, if you actually want to change something you need to get governments to make laws to limit how much can be produced for example. <br />Individual actions won&#39;t significantly change anything	UCQBKSdOgRBQvgZiwtGTPaWg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQBKSdOgRBQvgZiwtGTPaWg	0

UgzgfvvCiibOFDQuhuB4AaABAg	1	0	2020-05-13 12:52:49	Michael-Luca Natt	What this video does not examine further is how the farming practices largely influence overall emissions. Cows, while big producers of methane, have the incredible ability to aid in carbon SEQUESTRATION through the fertility their manure provides to land. Since the demand of beef is so high and people eat so much of it (just eat less), farmers have been pressured to raising beef the most profitable way, typically not through responsible practices. But by no means are cows the problem, we are. Instead cows could actually be part of the solution through responsible holistic management like intensive rotational grazing and composting on site. The reality of crops and beef being raised separately disrupts the possible cycle of fertility that could actually aid in soil building, and offset the methane emissions a herd produced.

That level exposure of methene, is that enough to make a green house with that much dose or exposure?

Cow droppings actually trap methane in the soil, enriching it. Look up Allan Savory, he knows a thing or two about agriculture. I think we can all agree that factory farming is bad, but meat is not only good, it is essential for human health, especially in times like these where a strong immune system is vital. A vegan diet is far worse for the environment, plants often need to be imported, and imagine replacing manure with synthetic fertiliser. A vegan world is a plastic, toxic world.

Allowing people to come to their own conclusions and make their own choices makes it more likely that any behavior changes are sustained. For years I heard people telling me that I “must” stop eating meat, that I was “wrong” or “bad” for my food choices, and I tuned that all out and kept doing what I had always done. But when I looked at simple facts regarding climate change and the greenhouse gas emissions of various animals food sources I was able to come to my own conclusions, which means that I now eat only plants. I suppose the vegan activists count that as a “victory” but whatever, I didn’t do it to please them, I made the change for myself.

It simply pointed out that beef production has a severely disproportionate impact on the environment compared to pretty much any of kind of food, and explained why that is. It pointed out that if you want to reduce your impact on the environment, then reducing your consumption of beef is an obvious place to start. I hardly see how this is pushing an agenda. The video didn't tell you to go vegan, or to eliminate beef consumption completely. It presented you with the facts and left you to make up your own mind. If someone thinks that this means "an agenda" is being forced upon them, then I guess in reality that they're probably just upset and guilty from having the damage from their beef burger and steak habit being pointed out to them!

If we all bring it down to under 10% of our diet, the planet can handle that. It's like fossil fuels, the planet can handle a little so we don't need to over-react with absolute zero emissions. However, the reality is, we are a long way from that point, people are still not wanting to sacrifice a familiar lifestyle.

Our tax money, even if we don't eat beef, supports beef. Once again the solution to a large issue is a political change and the political will to change the status quo. Some big corporations, McDonald's, Coke, Pepsi and other big food corporations will spend millions to keep beef cheap.

Digesting grass is not something we can do. and turning sunlight and soil into usable energy is not something cows can do. so while you're correct, leaving it at that is a disingenuous way to invalidate what is a clever insight - that emissions per calorie changes that graph dramatically, and be much closer to illustrating the truth of the issue, since you need 10x the mass of plants to get your 2500 calories a day.

The high pollution levels is because of lack of inforcement of environmental regulation and vehicular emissions. Stubble burning also causes increased air pollution in North India. Chemical, Oil refineries and Pharmaceutical industries pollute the air, land and water in India more than anything.

The statement "beef industry causes global warming" is only true in West, where there is seperate industrial livestock farming for meat. Those breed are fast-growing high weight-gaining category specially grown for meat. They are not much useful for dairy industry, which has other type of breeds. In India, there is no industrial livestock farming for beef. Almost all methane emissions in India is from cattle grown for milk. Our dairy farmers and farms give them for slaughter only once they run dry (no more able to produce milk) which forms major part of beef supply in India. For small farmers, this is the money they use to buy next cow. In fact, beef consumption in India helps reduce methane emission, because they remove such cattle from population, which otherwise will continue to emit it. Point is, dairy farms are major culprits. If anybody genuinely cares about this issue, the best way is reverse "White revolution" and promote reduction milk consumption.

You should compare India (1.35b people - 2.7Gt emissions) to the US (330m people - 4.9Gt emission) + EU+UK (510m ppl - 2.9Gt) + Japan (126m ppl - 1Gt) + remaining ‘advanced economies’ of Australia, Canada, Chile, Iceland, Israel, South Korea, Mexico, Norway, New Zealand, Switzerland, Turkey (360m ppl - 2.5Gt). With about the same population, that’s 11.3Gt in “the west” vs 2.9Gt in India. Pollution doesn’t have borders, it’s silly to compare tiny polluting countries to giant low emission countries and blame the people in the giant one.

Really, I pretty much went to extreme lengths, meaning I only ate the fruit (or ice (yup, for a certain time they served fruit flavo(u)red ice)) of school lunches. Now I act like a normal person and eat pizza. Although I suggested using nut cheese (yup, that’s a thing!) instead of actual cheese, welp, I guess we’ll have to make do with the actual cheese. Of course, when it comes to real milk, I usually try to avoid it. So I put almond milk in coffee (not lactose intolerant), drink almond milk, and that’s it. Edit: I guess once you bring boba tea into the mix, it'll add dairy.	UC99jSRVGYdchp0DWrjjzqKQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC99jSRVGYdchp0DWrjjzqKQ	1	UgxwhFxJ5I_Eg72Ly1F4AaABAg	Sankalpa Koirala

Anything that can drastically reduce climate change is an adjustment worth making. We base our conclusions and worldview on evidence. If you’re calling talk about climate change “alarmist,” I hate to break it to you, but you’re the non-evidence-based ideologue in the room.

The UK model also uses &#39;unfarmable&#39; land to graze livestock, areas that are not farmable to any other &#39;crop&#39;. This is grass lands that when the cattle are circulated from field to field, regrows, draws back in more carbon, before being eaten again by the returning livestock heard.<br /><br /><br />Yes the methane is a factor that we must look at, and the vast amount of Beef that we consume worldwide should be reduced. But if done correctly, then it can work for us in the long term.	UC98dnQ8kN9hjFNufdPjHxJg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC98dnQ8kN9hjFNufdPjHxJg	0

Since it is per kg and not for example per calorie or per realistic serving. For example no one that I know off consumes an entire kilo of coffee.<br /><br />Also if we would compare the amount of CO2 Used per calorie it would be expected that chocolate, that is currently al the way to the right to move a lot closer to fruits. Since chocolate may contain 10x more calories per kilogram than fruit.<br /><br />It would also have been interested to see some processed foods.

I’m arguing that some foods like chocolate and coffee may look bad for the environment while they actually aren’t that bad, as they would appear from the shown graph. And suppling these other graphs could help people evaluate what the greenest choice would be when considering what they want to eat. You will most likely be able to conclude that nuts are a green option from both graphs. It is just that adding those other graphs would make food items like coffee and chocolate to be represented better and thus enable the viewer to make a better decision on what they would like to eat.

Massive areas of the western province have been changed into greenhouse farms growing every kind of vegetable that won't grow in the natural climate. The biggest area there is called Westland, Next to Rotterdam and below The Hague which is about 40 square kilometers of greenhouses producing a ton of food each year.

It’s not hard to understand.<br />Earth is a greenhouse naturally thanks to CO2, O2, CH4, N2O, and others. Without them Earth won’t be habitable, but add too much, you offset the climate. Everything is balanced. But humans are dramatically offsetting that balance and sending Earths into rapid warming 20x faster than the rate it took us heading into the PETM 56 million years ago. When our planet was 3° to 4° cooler 20,000 years ago, North America was covered in an ice sheet several hundred feet thick, the modern Holoence gave rise to modern humanity, 4° or 5°C hotter than today in just a century. Human civilization will struggle. <br />And it sickens me when people say “it’s a scam a hoax” when scientists are trying to address an issue, science is important, it saves lives, being in denial, you cause problems. I really wish sometimes people in politics were actual scientists so we<br />can fix these problems. <br />Climate change is real and the solution is easier than the problem but either people are ignorant or just don’t care and don’t act. I’m not saying we have 12 years to live, and humanity (maybe) could adapt to it, but why risk it and make our future generations suffer? <br />While Global Warming and Cooling events in Earths history have never completely wiped out life on Earth. They have been responsible for mass extinction events nearly every time. It’s ridiculous, science denial is dangerous.

You have 0 influence on the behavior of others if you never encounter them. They won't magically eat more beef cos you stopped eating beef. --- Let's go back to our example. So we say please eat less beef and 100 stopped we have 900 - but in the mean time 50 people started eating beef (which is unlikely, cos more often than not if you don't eat beef in the beginning you have a reason for it - be it taste, believe or whatever). But we would still have 50 people less than before, which would lead to a decrease of 5% Methan -> 1050 people emitting CO2. Still very significant! That's the point.

If 99 more individuals stop eating beef there are only 900. And the demand drops by 10% - which leads to 10% less beef. Which leads to 10% less methan. And methan has a 21x higher potential over 100years. So basically if 100 people stop eating beef, it means they save as much as 2100 people emitting CO2.

However, the real issue with rice is the huge amount of water it requires in agriculture. The fields where rice plants are grown are literally flooded to prevent other weeds from growing. Only rice can grow in a flooded field. Many dams in Asia provide free irrigation to these fields. These dams provide more water to the rice fields than to other uses, like as drinkwater, combined. In a time when a global water crisis is also looming, rice agriculture will need to change if Asia doesn't want to run out of freshwater.

The dairy industry has already started feeling the squeeze in some countries due to the popularity of plant-based alternatives. So if everyone didnt eat beef or even just cut back on Beef, the Beef industry would adjust for that demand and scale back so they're not spending more than they need to on land, feed and workers.

Ugy3_4reX3co5snL7R94AaABAg.98af504qYkA98axxOePg3-		0	2020-05-13 14:53:32	-	• Cheese causes extra emissions due to the processing required to turn milk into cheese. • Milk is non-cow sources which is the most common source outside of western countries, and it's low. • Cow-milk requires cows, so it's higher than non-cow milk. • Beef requires extra processing on top of the base emissions from cows. • One cow can produce milk repeatedly, but it can produce beef only once, hence beef is so much higher than milk.

It’s industrial beef farming which is the big baddy and highlights that one of the key things that needs to done is souring meat more consciously.

Even if every person stopped eating beef and foods that contribute to greenhouse gas emissions (which is impossible if you&#39;re poor and can&#39;t afford to choose what you eat), it would not solve ANYTHING. This doesn&#39;t mean we should do nothing, but demonising and guilt tripping people in this way is a very bad look.

It’s a hard truth indeed. I still like beef. But I guess there won’t be any significant change if there’s no some kind of policy from government to limit the amount of livestock allowed in a scope of area. Without it, people always find a way to meet the high market demand since adjusting meat consumption isn’t generally favorable for most people, statistically speaking. Not to mention the dairy products, it’s quite complex as well. I wonder if there’s any society (state or country) which has optimized the regulation and the behavior regarding this issue..

Indians have much less per person greenhouse emissions than any country in the west. I’ve lived for 12 years. In many places, except cities, most of milk is supplied by local raised cows. People have like 4 ish cows in villages and they basically provide the supply chain. How much methane do 4 cows emit? The idea is there are not too many. In the west, calves are basically produced for beef. None of that in India and like cows are not artificially impregnated. So cows have like 1-2 kids rather than 5-6 which matters because think about exponential growth in this situation.

On a serious note, beef consumption should be reduced in general, but I don't believe going vegan is the only option if you care for climate change. From transport to energy consumption, we can do take steps to reduce our footprint that way too.

It seems that the current consumption is just too excessive, so a little moderation sounds reasonable. I don't think we need to eat beef everyday, and thus no need for beef products to be available 24/7 wherever we go. No need to be able to buy slim jims and beef jerky everywhere anytime, but it's nice to have a burger or steak once in a while.

In fact, plant based options are often cheaper than meats. This video isn't to persuade the person who is living dollar to dollar to change their eating habits (although it might help them), this video is designed for the people who CAN financially and responsibly make that choice. And to add on, you realize it was from meat consumption that pandemics get started? The way meat is processed and sold in today's world is just a dream come true for bacteria and viruses. If we didn't eat meat we would not have this pandemic.	UC2rVZKNULtTMpmTQcVFtBGw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2rVZKNULtTMpmTQcVFtBGw	1	UgyJOuILWBzYSxpTpqh4AaABAg	Lavendexx

That source being corporations who knowingly sacrifice our Earth for the sake of profit. For the most part, individual boycotts are barely negligible in the modern age because large-scale meat producers also typically own several non-meat brands/products. That holds true for many non-meat yet also environmentally detrimental brands. Regulation is the way to go.

If you stop buying beef your whole life, that means there’s a significant amount of beef that doesn’t need to be made. If many people made that choice beef would stop being produced because the demand has plummeted. The idea isn’t that a single person can solve global warming. It’s that everyone takes actions because everyone is contributing to global warming. Also congress can’t stop people from eating beef.

Similar to fast food, everyone complains about how unhealthy it is, but then wants the fried chicken sandwich, fries, and dipping sauce, instead of the salad... It points to how complicated this actually is - the battle between what we agree with and what we actually do. Perhaps there is a slow trend toward good choices that we just don't register yet, because it's so gradual.

The sun supplies 99.7% of all light and heat the earth receives. Most are aware of the suns 11 year cycle, which repeats. Is it possible the sun has other cycles, conveniently not mentioned? Every 230-260 years the suns output of heat and light drops to a low point. Our sun is a dynamo that generates output, stable enough it does vary due to conditions within. Valentina Zharkova, a mathematician and Astrophysicist used Nasa data to develop a predictive algorithm that supports and explains why this occurs. Three distinct areas of circulating plasma, always interracting, sometimes inhibit and at other times reinforce generated wavelength strength. If you understand anything about electricity you will understand three phase output is greater than a single phase. Then think of a motor that ramps up or down, its output varies, as does its corresponding magnetic field strength. The sun presently is at the lowest point of magnetic fieldcstrength invhundreds of years. Our history clearly shows this happens repeatedly, the last being the dark ages, where heightened volcanic and earthquake activity took place. Temperatures began to cool and winter season became longer with each passing year. The cycle lasts about 30-50 years. Roy Spencer was a Nasa scientist tasked with running a planned experiment, using satellite data to prove the Greenhouse effect. Spencers conclusion was that the effect was minimal and certainly far less than expected. So what did proven science do. Criticized and then ignored him. This is how an agenda works. Dont take my word for it. Research: Henrik Svensmark Valentina Zharkova Roy Spencer About three months ago, a Euorpean organization representing 23 different countries petitioned the UN towards holding open discussion on climate change.

Beef, poultry and the entire meat industry is heavily subsidized by taxpayers, whether it's imported or domestic. While produce and plant based foods are better for the environment, the cost to consumers is much higher. That's just one of the reasons why a lot of working class and poor people eat meat rich diets. If we readjusted our legislative priorities in terms of how we subsidize food production and made the cost of meat reflect its true cost to our society, far fewer people would eat it as often. This is a market solution to the problem, which conservatives praise as the best way to approach public policy, yet they steadfastly oppose such ideas by falsely labeling it as government controlling what you can or can't eat, because meat producing companies are a big contributor to GOP politicians.

Manufacturers won't produce as much, etc. What you do today doesn't have an immediate impact and that is frustrating. But think beyond your day, your week, your year, your lifetime, and consider how your habits inform the future.

When it's between survival and basic needs versus protecting the planet, people will try to find ways to survive. It's hard to think about reducing, reusing, and recycling when you live in an apartment with no heat in the middle of winter. People also were taught wrong. The hierarchy of what's important for someone to work on for climate change became recycle, reuse, reduce instead of reduce, reuse, and recycle. I see this happen because people just recycle anything they think can be recycled (which 30% if the time they're wrong) because they're helping. Chicago has warehouses full of cardboard because they do not have the capacity to process the amount they get. This phenomena is also part of society. You can't go up to someone who has been living the life of fast fashion for two decades and convince them to stop even if they have the financial means to. You have to speak their language in order to get them to understand. For some people, that's the news. Others, movies and entertainment is more effective. The bottom line is though, many are told and understand the threat and are also in poverty struggling to survive. In my humble opinion, the world should focus on improving public transportation and building cities in a way that supports public transit rather than places like the US where streets built for roads are everywhere. Not only does public transportation reduce climate change, affordable and accessible transportation is the number one factor in getting people out of poverty. If people have more money, they can focus on what they're buying more rather than finding the cheapest meal options.

Change some beef for Chicken, use reusable bottles when it's not inconvenient, turn off lights when you're not using them. I've been doing that and while i don't think I'm "green" at all, something is better than nothing.

Because by not buying it, you reduce the demand. And the hope is that others follow suit and do the same thing. Change has to start with one person. If lots of people make the change, the demand wouldn't be there so naturally the supply would drop. I'm not saying whether I'm for or against climate change, I'm just saying that argument doesn't really hold	UCvgyQOBBXRCl1pC6QfagSIw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvgyQOBBXRCl1pC6QfagSIw	1	UgzlYyrl3GwD751_PhF4AaABAg	Zeytrixx
