There has been a few hundred year lag between temperatures rising and Co2 levels rising. Between 1940 and 1975 there was an economic boom, causing more Co2 to be pumped in the atmosphere due to mass production, yet the temperature over these 3 decades was decreasing. Also, assuming that human breathing will have a drastic affect on Co2 levels is laughable.	UCK9mbWWPsG-HXj_hg7w6zKQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK9mbWWPsG-HXj_hg7w6zKQ	0

The correct terminology is scientific american journal not simply "scientific american", i was playing dumb in order to have a crack at humour that obviously went over your head. You also prove to be unknowledgeable. It is a basic flaw of fundamental science to state that temperature rise is caused by Co2. They're trying to change fundamental science to fulfill their needs. Remember in the 70s when these "scientists" (many of which are still scientists today) were shitting themselves about the next ice age, just because of a couple decades in temperature drop. Because nowadays science has become a business.	UCK9mbWWPsG-HXj_hg7w6zKQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK9mbWWPsG-HXj_hg7w6zKQ	1	UgyLPAxHRgDWCJiCqnB4AaABAg	NotMeta

So they started talking about climate change and saying it would cause more hurricanes, but then we went 12 years without one hitting the US and the numbers fell. They talked about snow disappearing and then it snowed heavily so they said it would cause heavy snows. They said it would cause worse storms but then we stopped getting really serious storms for years at a time. The number of really bad storms decreased.

The atmosphere of Venus is ninety times as thick as Earth's at its surface. If you look at an altitude of around 50 km above Venus's surface where pressures are similar to those on earth, the temperature is not that different from Earth despite the 96.5% CO2 atmosphere. Look up "lapse rate." Jupiter, with no greenhouse gases, has a similar increase in temperature as you descend in its atmosphere. The surface temperature on Venus is the result of the gradient between its core temperature and its upper atmosphere temperature, with a minor contribution from the greenhouse effect. On Mars, which has five times the total amount of CO2 (the number of CO2 molecules between the surface and the sun) as in Earth's present atmosphere, there is no appreciable warming as a consequence.

Most people concerned about climate would expect 97% of climate scientists to say they were convinced that man is causing climate change and that climate change will be castrophic. That is clearly not the case. The scientific controversy is about climate sensitivity: the temperature effect of a doubling of atmospheric CO2. It is not about how quickly to act - that is a political controversy driven by propaganda. It has yet to be proven that CO2 is actually causing climate change (the hiatus and lack of sea level rise call that into question), whether that change will be harmful (past warm periods were prosperous), whether mitigation efforts would be effective, whether they would be worth it on balance, etc. You want to skip over all that and jump from "CO2 is rising" to "we must act." That is superstition, not science.	UCWil34Irypxxtl97IDX9zbQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWil34Irypxxtl97IDX9zbQ	1	Ugg94w2zHSjIZXgCoAEC	George Applegate

The point is when asked which side of the debate they fall there is an *82%* vs *11%* split. That‚Äôs a very clear result. Lets not play a disingenuous game of semantics. *_‚Äúthe only other survey, had to whittle the list of thousans of scientists down to only 77 before they got the 97% they wanted‚Äù_* There was no _'whittle down'_ of anything; Of all members of the AGL directory asked to respond to a survey for the _American Geophysical Union_ more than 3000 did. When asked the question _‚ÄúHas human activity been a significant factor in changing mean global temperatures?‚Äù_ ¬† *82%* of the total agreed that it had. 77 out of the 79 climatologists represented also agreed or *97%.* This result is also clear, but isn‚Äôt alone.¬† The *97%* figure has been corroborated by other studies including by the National Academy of Sciences of the U.S.A. They found that of around 1,400 climatologists most cited, and active in the field *97%-98%* agreed with the IPCC regarding the role, and impact of human activity on climate change. They also found a correlation with climatologists most likely to publish, and most likely to be cited, accepting the IPCC's position. So not all climatologists are equal.¬† *_‚ÄùSkeptics also believe‚Äù_* Deniers believe an awful lot of things. Senator James Inhofe made a snowball in winter, and has the Bible to substantiate his denial. *_‚ÄùThe controversy is over just how much of a role.‚Äù_* I disagree. See the third paragraph above. The controversy is over if or when we are going to act. Pandering to deniers has to stop at some stage. If people believe the economy is more important then they should at least be honest about it.

Doran, the only other survey, had to whittle the list of thousans of scientists down to only 77 before they got the 97% they wanted, and even then the consensus was only on whether "human activity" (no mention of CO2) played a "significant" role. That's a loaded term since "significant" in a statistical sense would only mean a 95% probability that human activity played no role at all. Skeptics also believe climate is changing and that man plays some role. The controversy is over just how much of a role. It's a false dichotomy that one must either believe that climate change is entirely man made or entirely natural. Most climate scientists are in between.

The marginal generating capacity needed to charge them comes largely from coal fired power plants. Rich people buy the Tesla cars as toys for a price that is less than the cost of manufacture. The government pays Tesla something like $30K per car in subsidies. So the not-so-rich taxpayers are paying a big part of the cost of these coal fueled toys. A big part of that subsidy was because Tesla claimed that battery swap stations eliminated the long recharging times, giving the cars greater effective range. Only the battery swap stations were never built. Because of a loophole in the law, Tesla got the subsidies anyway. Elon Musk's handsome profits are a transfer of wealth from the taxpayers to him.

However these climate cycles are much slower than the type of change we are currently experiencing. You see, the climate change isn't necessarily the problem. It is the rate at which the climate change is occurring. And the current trend we are seeing carries an alarmingly fast growth in temperature, over the span of just a hundred years. So this would lead one to come to the conclusion that there is another factor speeding up the rate of change, and that factor is, you guessed it, man made emissions of carbon dioxide. If you need clarification or have any questions please please ask. I will answer to the best of my ability.
