title	The best argument AGAINST CO2 causing climate change?
description	I’ve been on the look-out for the best arguments why CO2 is NOT causing climate change. Here’s the best one I’ve found to date along with some counter-arguments and evidence. It looks at whether CO2 is saturated in the atmosphere and more CO2 will now make minimal additional impact on warming. We get into the science at a molecular level on this one! The Mallen Baker Show is aimed at all people who see themselves as change makers, with commentary on issues and change movements with a particular focus on climate change and environment, social issues, free speech and corporate social responsibility. UPDATE: Added reference to paper by Zhong & Haigh 2013' which covers the saturation topic directly References 1:56 Graph showing CO2 ‘saturation’ effect https://skepticalscience.com/saturated-co2-effect-advanced.htm 2:12 Graph showing logarithmic nature of CO2 impact http://clivebest.com/blog/?p=8837 2:36 Diagram of greenhouse effect https://medium.com/@tutorbin/greenhouse-effect-advantages-and-disadvantages-4d4f113ec61d 3:14 Composition of the atmosphere https://climate.ncsu.edu/edu/Composition 6:36 Article by Professor Ray Pierrehumbert http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2007/06/a-saturated-gassy-argument-part-ii 11:27 Paper on CO2 frequencies in energy radiated back to earth https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14240 12:02 Spectral signatures of climate change in the Earth’s infrared spectrum between 1970 and 2006 in the upper atmosphere https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ad77/baeca26c4f77a9d043a5b53e058ea959e495.pdf 12:02 And similar from 2016 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs40641-016-0039-5.pdf Additional reading Early paper (Kaplan 1952) showing CO2 effects in the upper atmosphere https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/1520-0469%281952%29009%3C0001%3AOTPDOR%3E2.0.CO%3B2 Useful history of the development of climate science, which gives good detail on the piecing together of the evidence https://history.aip.org/history/climate/co2.htm The greenhouse effect and carbon dioxide, Zhong & Haigh, 2013 https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wea.2072
