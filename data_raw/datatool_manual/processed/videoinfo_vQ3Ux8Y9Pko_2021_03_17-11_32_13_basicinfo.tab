title	Does Australia's government take climate change seriously? | A New Climate
description	Australia's prime minister, Scott Morrison, has arrived back in the country as bushfires continue to rage, creating "catastrophic" conditions. After apologising for being on holiday in Hawaii while large areas of New South Wales burned, he was due to visit the fire service's HQ on Sunday. As the blazes spread across almost 100,000 acres, Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack admitted there "absolutely" needed to be more action on climate change.
