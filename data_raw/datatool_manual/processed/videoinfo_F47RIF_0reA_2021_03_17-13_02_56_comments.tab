Now, so fractured we are, our apathy will extend to radical loonie democrat cities or bumbling retard republican cities, it's their fault if the bodies are piling up and that's really important to point out y'know!

And the beautiful thing is that Kukulkan has it own divine autonomy, hardware- and software configuration in contrast to the person six senses. With the Consciousness that is always here and now regardless of where the person is, sees through my third eye as the Akasha Keeper, the quieter I become the better I can hear the wisdom in the silence, is that what experience so I am no longer looking for experiences, has a unchanging kundalini Shakti Bliss lightbody and can talk with the language of Consciousness that uses no words but here the magic spells come from to program the Womb of Creation from HunabK√∫ that&#39;s pregnant with all possibilities. <br />With this I qualify as the Gamemaster from HunabK√∫; to help them who worship a God outside of themselves. So I am here to collect, in love &amp; light, your prayers from your deepest desires. To spiritual, with the language of Consciousness, offer those to the supreme Lord of the Cosmos: HunabK√∫ the architect of the holographic universe. So your hearts wish is my command to change this devastating age of stupid where we are currently living in to Paradise for future Generations. Their birthright! <br /><br /><br />Darling I am here for you enter: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/United-Universe-108979882465542/">https://www.facebook.com/United-Universe-108979882465542/</a><br />Namast√©, <br />Johan Kukulkan HunabK√∫	UCGr_PJ-cjy7ms3rTfpsuV_w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGr_PJ-cjy7ms3rTfpsuV_w	0

Don&#39;t look at the numerous climate scientists, studies, papers, and academic articles written critiquing the idea of climate change in all of its facets. If you want a diversion from the mainstream &quot;WE&#39;RE GOING TO DIE IN A 100 YEARS! MAN DID IT!&quot; Read Dark Winter by renowned climate scientist John Casey.

Lincoln just wanted the Country to stay together and not fall apart under his term . He said what he had to so the super powers in Europe wouldn&#39;t meddle in the civil war ,so don&#39;t give Abe Lincoln too much credit. The topic of climate change has as far to go in research and study . I like how it changes names from global warming to global cooling, since it researchers can&#39;t get it right. they just overreached and called it climate change based on barely 50 years of accurate weather records when the earth has been around for billions of years. Get outta here with that BS	UCd5AC6jNuWY7KXdhOBg1f4g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd5AC6jNuWY7KXdhOBg1f4g	0

Even his island resort is entirly environmentally friendly. The world cannot just change in an instant and politicians are making it extremely difficult to even try, trump for example, so instead by having every still using bad forms of energy, but protesting for change, the governments will change our world for the better. I want change, but I know I still use things that are bad for the enviroment, but I need our leaders to change, so we, and the rest of the world can.

What a crock of crap. If you can not live by the rules you set for others then your message is meaningless because you show that you clearly want to tell others what to do while not doing the same. Carbon offsets are other people doing as you ask not you. Hypocrite is what comes to mind when you say his name.

While the films carbon footprint may have been paid for with a voluntary carbon tax; Leos treks around the world in private jets is not. You may want to actually do your own research before making a fool out of yourself here again. Stupid Liberals pick and choose the words they want to hear and ignore the actual substance.

That is a Hypocrite. Your augment fell apart when you start to preach to others just like Leo. You want others to follow your rules. I do not fly a private plane when going on vacation, but he feels the need to fly a private plane to preach to the world. Ever see his yacht? if you want someone to follow when it comes to climate change follow Ed Begley Jr. he has been fighting for the environment the right way for years.

Or processed food? Do you drive a car to work? Do you have electricity in your home provided by the government? Do you fly with a plane to go on your vacation? Did you help one homeless person to get on his feet? Did you pick up that plastic bag by the road? Did you help clean up your local park? Have you ever planted a tree? Start looking at what you can do instead of criticizing others. At least Leo using his popularity to do Something. It does not matter if he will make more money or not - he speaks about the problem and a lot of people can hear him. I admire him. What are you doing to make the world a better place for your children and their children, hm?
