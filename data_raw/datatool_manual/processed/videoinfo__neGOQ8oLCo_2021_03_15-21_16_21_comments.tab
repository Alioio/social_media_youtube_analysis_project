Tiko Each and every action of ours brings about a change in this planet...it depends on our +ve and -ve actions. I don't know how to use big words to explain my p.o.v. What I want to say is yes there are still people like you and others who are aware about what is happening and what needs to be done. Awareness is already there it's just that people still ignore this issue and continue their day. I have seen many people in my contacts posting about climate change and earth today just to show that they care when infact the reality is completely different! This topic needs to come in our daily conversation only then will people do something. It true that one person can't change a lot of things but imagine if the steps taken to save the earth are done by a billion people. The effect would be completely different.

Ah oh we are just so innocent, we are so naive and ignorant, we are just going to blame each other because we are humans. We have every right to destroy everything which comes in our way because we are invincible. No one is above us.

Very aware. It's the effects of accelerated sea level rise that worry us. It's also things like extreme drought, changes in weather patterns that threaten food security, and water availability and climate refugees showing up on our doorsteps by the 10's of millions each year demanding access to these fundamental resources when our own supplies will already be questionable. Then things like insane wildfires that can't be extinguished by any machine known to man that rage for months on end, decimating people's homes and livelihoods. Oh and I forgot about the increasingly intense storm events that literally rip the roofs off peoples homes. I mean all this stuff scares the shit out of me. You're not worried?

Then as expected it will keep on expanding as the heat rises there after.<br /><br /><br />So in simple terms, if the whole ocean was 0 Celsius and you heated it up to 8 Celsius, it&#39;s volume would not have changed. Water is at it&#39;s densest at 4 degrees Celsius.<br /><br /><br />So bearing in mind 90% of the water in our oceans is between 0-3 Celsius, so a temp increase of around 4-5 Celsius, would have little to no effect on sea levels from thermal expansion.<br /><br /><br />sources<br /><a href="https://physics.info/expansion/water-2.svg">https://physics.info/expansion/water-2.svg</a><br /><a href="https://physics.info/expansion/">https://physics.info/expansion/</a><br /><br /><br />Gil Ouellette, <br />Physical Geography, Climatology, Geo-morphology, Oceanography<br /><a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-average-temperature-of-all-the-water-in-the-oceans">https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-average-temperature-of-all-the-water-in-the-oceans</a><br /><br /><br />Thanks for taking the time to read this, from a concerned but sane resident of Planet Earth.

Dump more sand and raise some dunes along the coastal waters. Heck, you can extend the islands land mass to let some ocean water in to some degree then block the rest off with higher dunes surrounding the island.

I had to listen to it several times to confirm his words: " If we do a good job with vaccinations we should be able to reduce the worlds population by 15%" Would this help to save our planet? Christiana Figueres, executive seceetary to the UN on climate action was interviewed by "The Business daily" radio show and then reported by the Guardian news publication. Several other publications confirmed the interview held just prior the Paris accord talks, which Trump rejected. "To be honest, climate change is more about an over reaching goal in replacing the economic system that has reigned for over 150 years, Capitalism. Humanity has a unique opportunity within a specific time frame to accomplish something never before done" Socialism..... Later, in private, the meeting discussed the population agenda believing those reporting were sympathetic to their intentions. Climate is changing, naturally, with man's input, but our history clearly shows change occured when CO2 was not an issue. The dust bowls of the 30's, the dark ages, ice ages. We must all become good stewards of the earth but accusation and blame works well for politics and monetary interest that has wrapped itself around this topic. Try researching Valentina Zharkova, a mathematician and physicist who used Nasa data to develop a predictive algorithm on cyclical changes, over time, within our sun. Our sun is stable, but like a motor that speeds up and or slows down in output, so does our sun. How can this happen? Within the sun are three distinct circulating fields of liquid plasma. The fields of pure energy, are always interracting, sometimes inhibiting and sometimes reinforcing wave length field strength, which then alters the spectrum of light we receive. Light is affected by change in magnetic fields it must pass through. This cycle of change returns to earth every 230-280 years, manifesting in different ways; random flooding, progressively colder temps, failing crops, heightened volcanic and earthquake activity. The last time this occured was during the dark ages. Besides our earth literally being starved of carbon, CO2 is 1/2200 of our atmosphere and thermogenically does not retain heat. Where a commercial Greenhouse is maintained around 1200 ppm our atmosphere is 1/3 of that. The sun provides 99.7% of our heat and light, so even a small variation will notably effect us. Notice how Global warming has become climate change? Change is real, but it will not be warming we need to ultimately worry about. Each year will see colder temperatures and longer winter seasons. Change is not linear, warming will still take place but as change occurs, we must adapt.

It's an ever changing thing tor. One must feel pretty stupid to accept politicians (united nation's goverment politians global warming theory as fact when the top scientist in the face of the earth can't tell you what temperature it's going to tommorow. But yet blind ignorant people believe the taxing politians when they are telling you what temperature it's going to be 10 years from now.? As far as islands and sea coast goes its extremely common they rise and fall. Today there are many new islands and many coastal areas slowly sinking. Miami, New Orleans (us) are examples. New Orleans is 15 - 20 feet below coastal water levels. They had to build giant walls around the city. Sinking ground and beach areas are common. It's annual maintenance to add sand in the coastal shore line. Sea walls are to protect the waves from washing against the beach and land just as rivers bend and change. The UN taxing politians simply us the word science or scientists and some people void of common sense go stupid. Fact is there is not true science involved. It's called modeling. That's were each goverment around the world gets to fabricate, using only guessing, a model of what they think a list of elements should look like. You and I Can do the same. Then together if something doesn't match their imagination based on guessing then they claim it's bad. This is NOT real science. The same thing is used by non science health organizations to defraud and scare and manipulate societies into submission to radical social or taxing changes. Turning over your freedoms and money to them. It's called politics. This COVID thing which isn't even near as bad than the common flu (factual numbers) was all fake imaginative numbers in this childish "MODELING" game. Get it yet. ?
