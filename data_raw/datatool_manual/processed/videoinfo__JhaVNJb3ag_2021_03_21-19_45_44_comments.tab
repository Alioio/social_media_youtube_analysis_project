BBC, Earth Documentary, etc are talking about how Polar Bears are starving and struggling for survival, because of Global Warming. I just graduated from my Environmental Science class, and we did a huge project over this, where we had to write Essays about why it's hard for them to survive AND how can we help with some vocabulary words from our notes. This is real. Maybe not the part about the polar bear not being in the ice... But they ARE starving and dying because their food source is dying...

If the photographer had the time to film, he had the time to call for rescue, as it looks as if the bear was eating out of a trash can, which means "local" to civilization. The bear was so weak, a group of half witted humans could have found a way to corral the poor bear until animal rescue arrived; even if hours later or the next day. NAT Geo. you let the bear go. I hope it was worth the glory of the viral accolade and the heart wrenching music applied to the video. Nice move.

There is no evidence that global warming or climate change had anything to do with this bears condition. Plenty of other polar bears roaming around just fine. It is obvious that this animal had some sort disease. Natgeo shows it's ignorance and hypocrisy in using a lame bear for its political propaganda and bottom line. Should have grabbed a gun instead of a camera and and had mercy on this animal.

You have written in vid feeding a polar bear is illegal, just ask yourself when did protecting environment became illegal, when we are destroying it we don't care about legal or illegal then why will we care while saving it at least we can try, saying this and that rather trying is cowardness. I am not telling you to go and feed him with your hand, just try to help him rather filming him die which is legal.

Approaching a starving animal, especially a polar bear, would have been insanity. Secondly, this bear is from an area where polar bear populations are doing well. This bear is not starving due to "global warming". Far more likely it is dying due to a parasite infestation, cancer, or a neurological disease. Climate change is a serious issue, and if you want it taken seriously you have to avoid labelling easily debunked nonsense as evidence while running about screaming "The sky is falling!" Jackasses.

But what I do know is that this guy's life was seeping from him and instead of calling some wildlife protection agency to save him or just help in ANY WAY; they post a video about it. Paul I'm disgustingly disappointed in you so far. I thought Nat-Geo had a higher respect for animals and all wildlife...I was wrong. This video will probably be taken down, but Most Importantly Changes Need To Be Made.

As more food recycle programs grow, less edible waster can be consumed by them scavenging. Polar bear population has actually grown, but outside of that there is always a “feast and famine” scenario with prey and predators where bears have starve as part of the cycle. Biggest greenhouse gas is water vapour that never gets talked about, which has recent correlations to solar cycles (how much heat the sun puts out). And lastly polar bears haven’t been around forever. It seems that we (humans) come with expectations that things remain the same forever, when in fact the only thing constant is change. The only true influence we have on a global scale is if we were to go to nuclear war. Outside of that we only truly affect local climate islands. Global climate changes regardless of our actions, but local is more from us as urban islands. Local air quality is us. Globally the world will change no matter what. Let’s not forget the earth’s history has had times of almost no ice.	UCMe-fa-FNYMYO6xf4XsGtDA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMe-fa-FNYMYO6xf4XsGtDA	0

We all get it. This polar bear is dying. Some (hopefully most, if not all) might even make the HUGE mental leap to deduce that this is caused by climate change. What has happened here is not natural. This is because of human impact. We should do everything to preserve nature. To be better keepers and protectors of the natural world. Especially as our population grows and we use up more and more of the natural wetlands and untouched parts of the world. The passive observation of it all is just so abhorrent to me.

It’s easy to find a animal that appears to be starving and say climate change is the reason for it. Maybe that bear just got sick or injured by another male polar bear after a fight. If climate change is as real as it’s claimed to be then don’t pity that bear but mankind instead	UCsxI7QgaRtvusqrbRQxlXCw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsxI7QgaRtvusqrbRQxlXCw	0

Polar bears aren't fast enough to catch fish. They eat seals, walrus and small whales while using breathing holes in the ice...that has melted due to climate change.

There might be something wrong with it. It might be getting too old to hunt well, and it may have lost a lot of teeth due to old age. Polar bears will eat fish but they mainly hunt and eat seals 🦭 and Carrion like dead whales. They also eat walruses, narwhals, and bowhead whales. If food is scarce they will eat anything they can catch.	UCWKLeB7dpHzReErBVXs60kg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWKLeB7dpHzReErBVXs60kg	1	UgzoqleZr5hFjdI-ODx4AaABAg	Gbajabiamila Raheem

I adhere to God&#39;s rules not the laws of the very people that seek to destroy everything living on Earth including the human race. What isn&#39;t against the law now anyways. You get a $500 fine for walking now thanks to the scumbag eugenists bioengineering viruses. Gates Soros the Royal Rs and billionaires can bloody have the Earth, they&#39;ve ruined 90% of it anyways. Polar bears will just be the next endangered species to become extinct on a long long long list.	UCbn6nYoRcI824fw5-EoCz3Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbn6nYoRcI824fw5-EoCz3Q	0

And my name is Son Hwasu. <br />I Saw this video.<br /> <br />I was really surprised and realized that climate changes are really serious now. So I had decided to inform loads of people about the Severity of the climate changes in my way. <br /> <br />I have a plan to make a video for video contest. If my video is selected, more people could see your video that is about the starving polar bears. And I wish that makes people could do some protections of the environment. <br /> <br />In conclusion, I would like to ask if I can use your video for the contest video. I think it would be really good if it was available. Please inform the way to use your video in right way. I&#39;ll wait for your answer. Thank you. Wish everything is going to be alright.

That bear wasnt just starving, it had a disease that affects the joints so it couldnt even swim, THATS why it was starving. It wasnt solely climate change and i doubt it had much to do with this. I cant remember the name of the disease but i know for a fact that bears end up like this once in awhile from the disease, its rare but happens. Im not denying climate change, as someone who actually lives in the arctic i know global warming is a fact, but nat geo you are contorting the narrative. <br />Also you know the story is bent because it says this was captured in Iceland, then says it was at Baffin island...

By feeding it, let's say a handful of food with very less caloric content, you'll just be prolonging it's suffering. The only way you could possibly have saved that bear, was by dropping a 350kg leopard seal in front of it. And even then, the bear populations would be worse off because this bear would go on to reproduce with weak genes.

Considering it seemed like he had been unable to catch food for maybe months and one time feeding wouldn't give him enough energy to hunt by himself. If you feed him regularly, it's possible that he could regain his strength but then he'll be too close to human settlement that chances are, he'll hunt pets or cattles or maybe even humans. If that happen, locals would became angry and many would (as I've seen it happen too many times) hunt not only the bears that killed their animals but every bears they encountered.

If the food comes down from the sky they would not think human is giving them food. In my opinion this could be a safe solution. I am saying that because if you go to a supermarket is full of meat, so we shoul give them some food to help these beautiful animals 😊 I don&#39;t want to lose these animals , I think nobody would, not even bbc earth or others associations..So why don&#39;t help them?

Humans caused the problem in the 1st place starting from the industrial revolution. That&#39;s why the bear is starving. Humans affecting the environment with industry and agriculture! How can you just stand there and do nothing. The photographer is guilty of doing nothing except forwarding his own agenda of climate change! Shocking! National Geographic shouldn&#39;t employ this photographer anymore. Hope he starved one day and nobody helps him out and worse they just pull out their phone and film him for a Youtube snip!!!

Gather some information from people like conservationist or whatsoever and post it on the article does not help the bear which was captured in this video. The people behind this footage is like humans who killed these animals just to use their fur for fashion. Yes, it is because of the global warming but the humanity cannot change the global warming specially if others doesn&#39;t want to participate in order to stop it. I would rather go to jail than just seeing this animal suffer because of global warming that we humans are the cause. You are making documentaries about animals and have said that they are important for the balance of the ecosystem yet you just capture a video of the bear without doing anything.

I remember one issue of National Geographic which showed a photograph of an entire forest of tree stumps, lamenting how terrible it was that somebody could do such a terrible thing to Mother Nature. Nobody ever to remind the editors that it was private property, and the owner decided to clear that forest for subsequent commercial development, which he had every right to do. You generally can't make a living and pay taxes on land unless you do something to make a living off of it. Sorry, but that is the way it is.

Polar bear population is tracked throughout 19 groups so u have situations where a certain group's numbers start to fall but certain groups like the Chukchi sea polar bears continue to thrive despite sea ice decline. The GWPF also estimates that the polar bear population has increased by 30% in the last 50 years (this is based on observational studies). They have called on the US administration to reassess the endangered species status of polar bears but im not sure if this has been done yet. (It is a highly debated topic so I could be wrong.)

And by 'us' I mean nearby human settlements. By all means, go visit those settlements and ask them why they don't feed the bears. They'll tell you exactly the same story I just did because it's happened before. If you still insist on feeding them then by all means do it - as long as you actually stay there so you can reap the consequences yourself. By the way, it was proven that this bear was old and sick.

Seals are its main food source right? they cant catch seals without ice. since ice is melting polar bears have to use more energy to swim and when they use all their energy they don't want to eat.

That's really when I started to spot all the contradictions in this bs. None of the activists ever talk about precession or climate cycles. We never hear about the fact that a warming environment releases co2 from the oceans, meaning that a warming climate might be driving co2 release not the other way around. The crunch for me was the hiding of tree ring data in East Anglia. Ask any rabid activist "so what if the earth is warming a bit, isn't that better than the earth cooling?" and they'll pop a fuse.

When greenie’s stopped all bear hunts, yet build housing on bear territories... You will see more sick old starving bears &amp; more human contacts.

Is this a regular thing or just a one off? If it is becoming a regular occurrences than I fail to see why we cannot help. You don’t hand feed the animal. Just dumb some meat well away from human settlements and hope the bear finds it. That Polar Bear in the video would head to human settlements because it is starving which beats the purpose of not feeding it.

Basically, it’s believed the bear had cancer. The camera crew, rather than alerting Canadian wildlife officials, followed it for a full TWO DAYS, watching it suffer the entire time. Their goal? To pass it’s condition off as a product of climate change. This means that they put their agenda ahead of the suffering of this poor animal, rather than contact wildlife officials, who could have humanely tranquilized and euthanized the suffering animal, rather than let it continue walking around in pain.

I don&#39;t care what laws by Canadian, those laws are all made by stupid, selfish human. Its a life, you telling me it gonna extinct in coming years but you repeating the disaster done by human, first cause of global warming and now you are allowing them to starve and collapse, what the purpose you alarming us on this issue if you not even lend a helping hand, at least you call a helicopter to transfer them to somewhere nearest to have better condition for their living. The polar bears don&#39;t have handset and GPS, they don&#39;t know where towards to, and yet we human talking too much on our own interest. Fuxk us.

The bear population is generally healthy in that sector.<br />2) No, it would not have been a good idea to feed him. Even if it was not illegal, it would be futile. He would still have been sick and unable to hunt and would still have died...just a bit later.<br />3) No, it was not possible to bring it to a vet. It was on Somerset Island, a very remote island of the canadian arctic.<br />4) No, it was not possible to call a conservation officer. The closest conservation officer would have been at Resolute. That is a community that is too far and the conservation officer would have explained to you that they do not summon a helicopter for a dying bear.<br />5) It is also illegal to kill the bear yourself. Only the aboriginals b have a right to hunt them. But that is something that I would have done. Nobody would have known anyway. But then, you also need to have your gun with you and nobody in the filming crew had a gun I suppose.<br />6) Yes, I know. It is sad.

It was never a link that he as the firsthand witness of this scene ascribed to the video. <br /><br />Could NatGeo please respond and clarify? To what extent was this particular polar bear&#39;s emaciated state caused by climate change, and how did you come to this conclusion? <br /><br />I believe climate conservation is a real issue and something worth fighting for, which is why we all need to be very careful about getting swept up in unnecessary hysteria and overblown anecdotes. Every falsehood diminishes momentum and turns popular opinion against conservation.	UCb1z1zrVni9_TtzIZjwGevg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb1z1zrVni9_TtzIZjwGevg	0

Yes, polar bear can die because climate change if all their prey animals and water evaporate, but because in most cases change is gradual, animals move with the hunt and resources. It's not like a meteor strike that suddenly wipes out the food. Prey moves in another area, bears follow. Climate change has only affected in some polar bear populations, as a whole bears seems to be thriving more and more after the hunting regulations started. That is why the population as a whole has been increasing.	UColteEnxLE6ZxI3qIjOXlKw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UColteEnxLE6ZxI3qIjOXlKw	1	UgxFYZIa585tPFkEEO54AaABAg	jaredouimette1

But a necropsy result would have hamstrung Nicklen’s plan to use the starving-bear video to spur action on climate change, so he and his crew simply let the bear swim away without telling anyone, extending the animal’s suffering.<br />some previously undisclosed facts about the incident were revealed online in an essay written by Nicklen’s SeaLegacy partner, Cristina Mittermeier, destined for the August 2018 print issue of National Geographic. Mittermeier admitted Nicklen was scouting for an image that could be used to “communicate the urgency of climate change” when he spotted the emaciated bear. She confessed that she and Nicklen knew the bear was probably sick or injured before they started to film but proceeded regardless. She also revealed that days passed between Nicklen’s first sight of the starving bear and the actual filming of it: He told no one about the suffering animal while he waited for his film crew to arrive.&quot;<br /><br />Bottom line is you should have fed him. It is never illegal to do the right thing.	UCAY33rxSOeUyz4-1AbWf37g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAY33rxSOeUyz4-1AbWf37g	0

Dr. Karen Rode did a study evaluating polar bears communities who lived in areas with high ice loss vs areas with low ice loss and found the bears in the high ice loss areas did better in every category then the bears in areas of low ice loss. They were healthier, bigger, and had more Cubs. This video is completely wrong! YouTube is a cool format, but it doesn’t replace doing real research and gaining a true understanding of reality.

Now this, 2 million? People would rather focus on music than climate change? This is far more important than music. It’s wrong. We have about 12 years left in the world if we don’t fix this. At 13, I’m far too young to die. Even in 12 years, I’ll still be young. We need more people interested in climate change. Seriously.

Needs a spoken Greens political Party to express urgency for change &amp; an urgent Public vote to effect it.This is the World we are facing. Driven precious polar bears to starvation through our Selfish hedonistic lifestyle &amp; Govts. that continue to perpetuate a culture of non-regulated luxuries of liberties to professional Ocean fishermen, depleting our Ocean of unregulated amounts of fish quantities. And hence, depleting fish sources for animals. Govts. need to take charge &amp; limit distributing ocean fishing licenses. Only allowing a token few. &amp; ban destructive fishing methods. Encourage Fish Farming should be the central, primary method consumers derive their fish consumption. Sell their boats for &#39;scrap&#39; &amp; adapt to greater expanse of replacement industry Fish Farming. So much unsold &#39;wastage&#39; is another indication of over-fishing. Yes, destrucrive emissions are at fault but not enough accountability is shone on &#39;excess fishing&#39; &amp; those Govts. that continue to allow it be committed.

UgwJnSn5M4z2N3NAWqZ4AaABAg.8vd4tnrzvlT92mAS4lKw31		0	2019-12-20 20:14:44	Carlos Martinez	hello. Climate change isn't accelerated by humans, it is a natural occurrence due to the solar cycle we are now entering (notice how none of the "widely available public information" mentions the sun whatsoever - the source of heat. Anyway, the reason people don't trust the "widely available public information" is because it has been altered and misrepresented countess times to fit the desired narrative that humans are accelerating climate change by releasing co2, a greenhouse gas. For example; NASA graphs linking mean global air temperature and ppm atmospheric co2 have completely ignored the vast cooling period between 1940 and 1970, as co2 steadily increases. Also, the Vostok ice sheet graph shows that co2 and temperature follow a trend with each other. However, correlation does not prove causation; you can't conclude that co2 causes an increase in temperature as there's nothing to say it isn't the other way around. That graph's time scale is in millions how years, so it masks the fact that if you focus on a more concentrated area, temperature increase precedes co2 increase by a significant amount. Surely if co2 is the causing factor, it is impossible that it increases afterwards? Again, this does not fit the narrative, so you never hear about it. The optimal atmospheric co2 concentration for plant growth (therefore increased biodiversity, more stable ecosystems and better lives for all organisms) is 1200ppm. Right now we are very sub-optimal at 400ppm. We need more co2, yet we are let to believe that this it is killing us.

Getting old and dying is different from starving to death due to human error which is leading their species to go extinct. Perhaps human intervention would be good as this law may be leading further to their extinction. Providing an helping hand may save the last of them to get them back to a healthy status as a species.

We humans have completely broken ''survival of the fittest'' and we don't know if that bear had any disabilities that made it weaker then others to hunt for food. If we feed all these kinds of polar bear then they would reproduce and their off spring will be worse of even and overtime the species will grow weaker and be reliable on humans feeding it.

There are confounding researches yet you pick the preferred ones ignoring the others. The truth is there are 19 subpopulations in the arctic area. 2 increasing, 4 decreasing, 5 stable 8 unknown. And I must say increasing populations are smaller compared to decreasing ones but the exact number is unknown. Moreover, this changes are thought to be despite the strict regulations in hunting in some countries and absolute prohibitions in the others in the recent decades. Global numbers are expected to further decrease 30% in 2050. And who is making propaganda about polar bear numbers who will benefit that polar bear secret society?

I understand that it is difficult but unless we put our heads together and get put aside selfish interests, we will be leading our planet to severe ruin. Take what's happened to this poor polar bear as an example. Take the Coronavirus pandemic that resulted as a result of extreme animal exploitation as an example. We need to change our way of living by realising that we cannot bring life back to normal, the normal we live today, when that was exactly the problem.

There are 3 and more generations of welfare recipients who no longer know how to "fend for themselves." But we still feed them... Why can't we have as much mercy on Polar bears? Well... They won't be able to fend for themselves for long with the arctic ice, their habitat, melting. So they will inevitably go extinct in the wild, "fending for themselves." Tragic. Sad. Feed them or they'll go extinct. We do that for whole countries ravaged by famine...why not these poor bears? :(	UCr8wmaub5uLZKjB61PpSeIw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr8wmaub5uLZKjB61PpSeIw	1	UgyvjK3vSyf6Zik5uoZ4AaABAg	Margie Baskins

Polar bears are numbering around 45,000 -55,000 . Which is 30k up from just 50years ago. How many bears are there supposed to be living in the artic which for 10months is virtually a complete frozen wasteland. They’re 800-1000lb beasts that have to eat regularly.

They definitely shouldve tried to singlehandedly carry(??) the (still very)large starving predator back to the nearest village without any means of transport or sedation to keep the (WILD)animal calm in order to stick it in the nearest well equipped zoo prepared to take in and handle the bear.....which very well could have been thousands of miles away\<br /><br /><br />On his death bed or not, if that bear had enough energy to walk over and try and find food it also had enough energy to bite you. And it wouldve been desperate and scared. And since there is almost no possible way to get it to a zoo or rehabilitation center or something than even if the photographers did have enough food to give it a suitable meal (which is highly highly unlikely) they wouldve only prolonged its suffering	UCHmlRZsHV_MjbEWdYFQkm4Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHmlRZsHV_MjbEWdYFQkm4Q	0

I’m not saying people shouldn’t empathize and feel bad- that’s the whole point. Feel free to express that. But they shouldn’t criticize the photographers when there was *nothing* they could’ve done. If it had the strength to dig in the trash than it had the strength to attack- even if much more weakly than usual. Especially since polar bears are notoriously aggressive and it’s desperate. And they almost certainly weren’t carrying any food appropriate for the bear or enough to truly make a difference. They would’ve risked their lives for nothing. Also: it’s illegal. I wasn’t in any way trying to be “high and mighty” but I just believe people should *think* before jumping on the comments to rant about the photographers. They did what they could: shared its story.

Why risk going to jail for feeding an animal once that will, once again, end up in the same condition that is seen here. The only true solution is that we help stop global warming. These people filmed this to show awareness. You should never feed wild animals, *EVER*. It wouldn't even make a difference. No human food could ever replace the bear's main diet of seal, which has crucial lipids and proteins that you won't find in a manufactured cow or pig. God, people are so ignorant.

UgzgNZ9LqkoKjVlDnZh4AaABAg	2	0	2019-04-10 14:35:04	Ryan Tuttle	Been hearing a lot about this video lately. It&#39;s become the iconic image for climate change.<br /><br />But it&#39;s full of misinformation on both sides.<br /><br />Polar bear populations around the world seem to be either stable or increasing. This video appears to be alarmist propaganda.<br />...but then I read that those numbers are stable because, in the short term, food is more plentiful for the bears due to the changing nature of the sea ice. And as with any boom, the bust will follow.<br /><br />So then it seems like we&#39;re at least partly (perhaps largely, perhaps not) responsible for the problem. Which makes people want to help. So they talk about greenhouse gases and renewable energy sources and all that.<br />...but it&#39;s our livestock--our cattle--that produce that vast majority of the world&#39;s greenhouse gases.<br /><br />Polar bears die. Many of them die of starvation. That&#39;s the natural state of their existence.<br />One starving bear is not evidence of an incoming calamity.<br />Furthermore, the area shown is not abnormally lacking in ice; it&#39;s summer on dry land.<br />But this bear has wandered far from it&#39;s usual haunts, perhaps to find easier food. Perhaps, in part, due to climate change.<br /><br />Climate change is a subtle issue with no overtly obvious symptoms or solutions.<br />To claim otherwise is dishonest.<br />To claim that it does not exist or that it is not a problem at all is irresponsible.<br /><br />We need to stop calling each other names and be honest, informative and willing to learn.

At least, not as much as they care about ratings. NPR is growing on me, though. They don't sling insults or mock people or push any agendas or ideologies. At least, not in any way that I've been able to detect. They seem to lean a little to the left, but few groups are going to sit squarely in the middle on all counts. I am open to facts and information, wherever it may come from. If it comes from an unreliable source, I'll try to find another. But I won't refuse to hear someone just because I disagree with 95% of what they say; that 5% might contain something worth knowing. Besides, if I want to be heard, I'd better be willing to listen.

Humans should not interact with animals at all cost! Let me give some reasons why. If humans interact with animals the wild animals might get to comfortable with seeing humans. This could be very dangerous for the animal because if a hunter comes by the animals wouldn't be concerned in running away for fighting. Another thing is that if humans keep on giving the animals food they wont want to hunt for their own food anymore and they will rely on humans for their food. This can do more harm then good. Another thing is that animal photographers and filmmakers are not allowed to interact with the animal at all cost! They are not allowed to even pet an wild animal if it comes and snuggle up with them. If you think about it, i'm absolutely sure that if it was legal they would.

Most animals are becoming extinct. The lions, tigers etc. <br />Human intervention is helping the afore mentioned any way but its just a matter of time. This animal will definitely die because its already marked.<br />Have you given a thought to global warming? Earth will die but gradually. Have you Any understanding on climate change and dwindling natural resources. <br />Natural disasters are on the increase, hate and hate crimes are increasing. Innocent people are being eliminated without a care and nations are rising against nations.<br /> <br />Have you ever thought about yourself or your lineage in this dispensation.<br /><br />Relax; you can&#39;t help the polar bear. Help yourself. <br /><br />The world has activated the self destruct mechanism and we are in the self destruct mode. <br /><br />Wake up and start seeking a saviour so you don&#39;t end up like that polar bear. <br /><br />Its misery can never be quantified in sorrows and regrets. <br /><br />Trump doesn&#39;t believe in global warming or climate change. His supporter&#39;s believe him too. <br /><br />While other countries are signing to protect the climate, he is trying to make money for America. <br />What&#39;s the essence of wealth? Is it to treat or manage sickness or disease?<br /><br /> This is the effect of global warming that the whole world is trying to prevent. <br /><br />Guess there is little you can do about it.<br />Cheers for your intentions are noble.<br /><br />Thanks.<br />Cheers.

You&#39;re not gonna go back to feed him. You won&#39;t be able to feed him back to health. Hypothetically, you manage to feed him back to health in a month or so, its a wild predator, it will attack you next once it has gained enough strength. Lets say, it doesn&#39;t attack you and you let it go in the place you found it, one or two months later it will return to the same condition, and suffer from malnutrition. And I think its not the only polar bear whose in this condition. Its the sad reality. The best solution would be minimizing global warming...

The polar bear population has been skyrocketing for a long time now, to the point where there isn't enough food to go around. What you're seeing in this video is simply how nature deals with this issue: those who are either too sick, weak or old to catch food die out. Eventually the food source (seal population) will bounce back and so the cycle continues.

The first line of the National Geographic video said, “This is what climate change looks like”—with “climate change” highlighted in the brand’s distinctive yellow. In retrospect, National Geographic went too far with the caption. Other news outlets ran dramatic headlines like this one from the Washington Post: “‘We stood there crying’: Emaciated polar bear seen in ‘gut-wrenching’ video and photos.” We had sent a “gut-wrenching” image out into the world. We probably shouldn’t have been surprised that people didn’t pick up on the nuances we tried to send with it. Yet we were shocked by the response. Many people expressed gratitude that we’d shined a light on climate change, but others angrily asked why we had not fed the bear or covered him with blankets or taken him to a vet—none of which would have saved him. Those responses revealed how disconnected people are from wildlife, ecology, and even geography.""

But its against the law to.Wild Animals should never be handled by humans. An example is that if they get to comfortable with humans they wont be concerned by a hunter coming along. Another thing is that the filmmakers and animal photographers are not allowed to interact with the animals at all cost. If a animal comes up to them they cant pet it snuggle it or anything. Please do research instead of getting mad.	UC1gOGcchAFilYuJUDJ1sokg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1gOGcchAFilYuJUDJ1sokg	1	Ugyb-1yj-I-yjFg1OUt4AaABAg	Heather Gustafson
Ugyb-1yj-I-yjFg1OUt4AaABAg.8sBV6NDjhwJ8sWgg3mluSt		9	2019-03-16 00:52:43	Half Way	Then we wouldn't have this video telling us about Global Warming. I'm pretty sure feeding polar bears is ilegal because they may relay on humans to the the point that they just go to beg for food and this means that they would be out of practice of their hunting skills, which means they would have to be put in a zoo and if it goes on, they would be extinct in the wild,no longer keeping their ecosystem in check. Second, it's dangerous to approach a wild animal even if they're starving. So it's dangerous for the human. They could use a helicopter and capture it, put it into a cage and feed it. However,like I said, human relations. Sure, that polar bear may just go on their mary way afterwards but think, what if they starve again? I think that normal human beings shouldn't feed polar bears, however a professional could do it. (They could feed them, then capture some seals for them to hunt(so not to lose hunting skills) and disguise their scents to insure that the polar bear doesn't get use to the scent. This is like pandas (except they are the polar bears are the victims of us and the pandas JUST WANT TO GO EXTINCT!)

The biologist Steven Amstrup predicted in 2007 that their population would fall by 67% if summer ice melted away. In 2015 the polar bear population was estimated at around *26,000.* Come on, if you consider yourself to be so knowledgeable then explain to us why biologist's Steven Amstrup's predictions didn't materialise?

Humans should not interact with animals at all cost! Let me give some reasons why. If humans interact with animals the wild animals might get to comfortable with seeing humans. This could be very dangerous for the animal because if a hunter comes by the animals wouldn't be concerned in running away for fighting. Another thing is that if humans keep on giving the animals food they wont want to hunt for their own food anymore and they will rely on humans for their food. This can do more harm then good. Another thing is that animal photographers and filmmakers are not allowed to interact with the animal at all cost! They are not allowed to even pet an wild animal if it comes and snuggle up with them. If you think about it, i'm absolutely sure that if it was legal they would.

Humans have impacted the planet negatively in so many ways: plastic pollution in the oceans, space debris in orbit crashing into satellites damaging military and civilian gps, aerosol weather modification, windmills killing millions of birds annually etc. Human accelerated climate change due to co2 release is objectively false. But anyone that disagrees with the "official narrative" or "consensus" is seen deemed unworthy of an opinion due to tribe mentality and echo chamber tactics.

UgwFSG0WxVVCSwnqHbx4AaABAg.8qVHidnWP2R92mATTX0u3e		0	2019-12-20 20:14:56	Carlos Martinez	hello. Climate change isn't accelerated by humans, it is a natural occurrence due to the solar cycle we are now entering (notice how none of the "widely available public information" mentions the sun whatsoever - the source of heat. Anyway, the reason people don't trust the "widely available public information" is because it has been altered and misrepresented countess times to fit the desired narrative that humans are accelerating climate change by releasing co2, a greenhouse gas. For example; NASA graphs linking mean global air temperature and ppm atmospheric co2 have completely ignored the vast cooling period between 1940 and 1970, as co2 steadily increases. Also, the Vostok ice sheet graph shows that co2 and temperature follow a trend with each other. However, correlation does not prove causation; you can't conclude that co2 causes an increase in temperature as there's nothing to say it isn't the other way around. That graph's time scale is in millions how years, so it masks the fact that if you focus on a more concentrated area, temperature increase precedes co2 increase by a significant amount. Surely if co2 is the causing factor, it is impossible that it increases afterwards? Again, this does not fit the narrative, so you never hear about it. The optimal atmospheric co2 concentration for plant growth (therefore increased biodiversity, more stable ecosystems and better lives for all organisms) is 1200ppm. Right now we are very sub-optimal at 400ppm. We need more co2, yet we are let to believe that this it is killing us.

Ice relfect 90% of the heat that bounce on and off from the Sun. The Ocean absorbs 90% if the heat from the sun. So glaciers melt faster do to the heating of the water. This causes polar bears to swim over 60 miles to reach Ice. Many polar bear starve and drown because of this and the first interbreeding of a Polar Bear and a Grizzly has been found probably because the polar bear was unable to find a mate.<br /><br /><br />This is climate change, nature change when the weather does.

They are solitary animals, and don't want to be near people or animals. If we feed them in their own land, no harm would happen. This is such a huge environmental issue. I am a chemical engineering student specialising in environmental engineering. You have no idea how horrible the situation is...... If we can help one bear, then we should before they go extinct.

Nat geo did the right thing by renaming this video. Because you&#39;ll with your arts degree won&#39;t even try to understand the reality of our world. We, we the human race killed our planet. We are the reason for our own destruction. We are the reason that polar bear is starving. Go watch any Ted talk on climate change and please educate yourself.

I just graduated from my Environmental Science class, and we did a huge project over this, where we had to write Essays about why it&#39;s hard for them to survive AND how can we help with some vocabulary words from our notes.<br /><br />This is real. Maybe not the part about the polar bear not being in the ice... But they ARE starving and dying because their food source is dying...

The area where this was filmed has actually a very stable number of polar bears for years now. So yes, maybe polar bears do suffer from climate change, but not this one.

The first line of the National Geographic video said, “This is what climate change looks like”—with “climate change” highlighted in the brand’s distinctive yellow. In retrospect, National Geographic went too far with the caption. Other news outlets ran dramatic headlines like this one from the Washington Post: “‘We stood there crying’: Emaciated polar bear seen in ‘gut-wrenching’ video and photos.”<br /><br />We had sent a “gut-wrenching” image out into the world. We probably shouldn’t have been surprised that people didn’t pick up on the nuances we tried to send with it.<br /><br />Yet we were shocked by the response. Many people expressed gratitude that we’d shined a light on climate change, but others angrily asked why we had not fed the bear or covered him with blankets or taken him to a vet—none of which would have saved him. Those responses revealed how disconnected people are from wildlife, ecology, and even geography.&quot;	UCDw0BflT6AR4DyzhLXJn_1w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDw0BflT6AR4DyzhLXJn_1w	0

If Climate Change (formerly known as Global Warming, Global Cooling in the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s) is actually happening, polar bears will have to learn how to adapt like everyone else, they&#39;re not special here, this is a changing world and EVERYONE has to adapt to the changes or die, NO EXCEPTIONS.

Why don't you tell that to the fifty plus people that are dead in the wake of Florence and the hundreds of millions of people that die each and every year from natural disasters. The human race is more advanced that anything else on this planet by far. You cannot expect other creatures, that were otherwise well adapted to their environment to adapt to changes in a short time. If you would have read a science book ever you would know evolution happens over thousands, even millions of years. The rate at which we are warming the planet prevents creatures from adapting or effectively moving to a more suitable location. Also if you would have read a science book ever you know there is a difference between climate change and global warming. We did not just "alter" the terminology. As a reasonably educated person might expect global warming generally refers to Earths surface rising in temperature. Climate Change are the effects that we are witnessing that are caused by Global Warming.

The first line of the National Geographic video said, “This is what climate change looks like”—with “climate change” highlighted in the brand’s distinctive yellow. In retrospect, National Geographic went too far with the caption. Other news outlets ran dramatic headlines like this one from the Washington Post: “‘We stood there crying’: Emaciated polar bear seen in ‘gut-wrenching’ video and photos.”<br /><br />We had sent a “gut-wrenching” image out into the world. We probably shouldn’t have been surprised that people didn’t pick up on the nuances we tried to send with it.<br /><br />Yet we were shocked by the response. Many people expressed gratitude that we’d shined a light on climate change, but others angrily asked why we had not fed the bear or covered him with blankets or taken him to a vet—none of which would have saved him. Those responses revealed how disconnected people are from wildlife, ecology, and even geography.&quot;	UCDw0BflT6AR4DyzhLXJn_1w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDw0BflT6AR4DyzhLXJn_1w	0

This would make polar bears less afraid to visit villages near their habitat for food, increasing the risk of attacks on humans. It's the same with any other dangerous animal. Or would you feed the lions around your village? This is not a law in order to prevent helping this species, it's a law in order to minimize the risk of 'accidents' Please do your research	UCAfxQpmnpj38GiqhOMbmyQw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAfxQpmnpj38GiqhOMbmyQw	1	UgyLdb97OAZ8xNRkX614AaABAg	NickAtNick

They are trying to make a point in that climate change has been affecting the natural predator to prey relationship. This can be deter mental the the sea lions population count and distribution too if you go more in-depth on this topic. All I’m saying is that they are trying to make a point and it is possible they have assumed the correct predicament of this bear. Climate change does have an impact on polar bears and many other polar inhabitants. And the impact is obviously for the worse.

But to directly state in a factual manner that this bear is starving because of it is a false ploy. There are countless reasons why the bear is in the shape that he is in...Perhaps he&#39;s just old? Maybe it&#39;s disease? Perhaps injury has prevented him from hunting?..His back foot/leg does look to be swollen and a bit tender, as the bear seems to be quite ginger when walking on it.

Is the ice actually gone right now, or is there some other reason this polar bear is wandering around civilization digging through trash cans. Maybe the caption should have been &quot;this is what a starving polar bear looks like&quot; as opposed to &quot;this is what global warming looks like&quot;.

We are causing the temperature to spike much faster than it should be which gives animals no time to adapt to the changing temperatures. And climate change isn’t just global warming. The carbon dioxide we are pumping into the atmosphere is naturally supposed to be underground. A large amount of it is being absorbed by the oceans which is causing ocean acidification. This is depleting calcium levels in the ocean, calcium needed by sea life such as coral and shellfish. And if the pH decreases by just one unit, all life inside of it will die including phytoplankton which produce 70% of the oxygen you’re breathing right now.

You'd have to know more about this bear's history to figure out the specific narrative. I believe in climate science but scientific literacy allows you to separate the bs. And this is bs. Even when polar bears have enough to eat their life is very harsh. I would not want to be a polar bear.

UgzGeu47EzNlX1ltJT94AaABAg	12	433	2018-07-30 10:48:23	kristen	Statement from Cristina Mittermeier, the photographer:<br /><br />&quot;The mission was a success, but there was a problem: We had lost control of the narrative. The first line of the National Geographic video said, “This is what climate change looks like”—with “climate change” highlighted in the brand’s distinctive yellow. In retrospect, National Geographic went too far with the caption. Other news outlets ran dramatic headlines like this one from the Washington Post: “‘We stood there crying’: Emaciated polar bear seen in ‘gut-wrenching’ video and photos.”<br /><br />We had sent a “gut-wrenching” image out into the world. We probably shouldn’t have been surprised that people didn’t pick up on the nuances we tried to send with it.<br /><br />Yet we were shocked by the response. Many people expressed gratitude that we’d shined a light on climate change, but others angrily asked why we had not fed the bear or covered him with blankets or taken him to a vet—none of which would have saved him. Those responses revealed how disconnected people are from wildlife, ecology, and even geography.&quot;	UCDw0BflT6AR4DyzhLXJn_1w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDw0BflT6AR4DyzhLXJn_1w	0

Because of ongoing and potential loss of their sea ice habitat resulting from climate change, polar bears were listed as a threatened species in the US under the Endangered Species Act in May 2008. The survival and the protection of the polar bear habitat are urgent issues for WWF.

And that is even if they are caught. To sit back and do nothing while they watch an animal die is inexcusable. You can&#39;t use the excuse of saying something is illegal to justify letting a starving animal die. If they were that concerned they should have called an rcmp officer in the area to assist them. I find this film unethical and heartbreaking not only because of climate change but also because of the photographers neglectful actions.

Think of the entire volume of the Atmosphere and seas and think how much energy needed for 1/3 of a degree. That was us. If you dont believe in human caused climate change at this point you are either misinformed, stupid or a troll. A few years ago? yeah some scientists believed it might not be caused by humans but since then we have seen the shift as the entire community has moved to seeing it as humans being the primary cause.

The difference is that they filmed this particular moment where this polar bear is on the brink of starvation. Unfortunately we don&#39;t live in a fantasy land that makes sure all animals are in tip top shape. It&#39;s just not possible (not as of yet)<br />And if it was the population of all the animals in the world would explode exponentially💥 and again as sad as it is it&#39;s nature&#39;s way of population control	UC7uT1FW1H7uYMLsfK1lWZ-Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7uT1FW1H7uYMLsfK1lWZ-Q	0

I think that is the reason and not global climate change. <br />Around 7000 years ago was climate optimus of current geological period after last ice age.

I&#39;m hopeless that we could ever save this majestic species from disappearing completely, we will pay the price one day, when global warming hits us directly in the communities we live, it will be too late to react, the only thing left to say, is to ask for forgiveness not only to polar bears but to every species we&#39;ve put in danger of extinction.

Polar bears arent dying off, most ignorant people think they&#39;re are on the verge of extinction, fact is there are much more polar bears then there were a few decades back. Most polar bear populations aren&#39;t in decline, and in the 600,000 years of polar bears existing they have thrived in multiple cooling &amp; warming periods. Absolute bull to find an aging starving bear and manipulate people into believing the climate has caused the destruction of the species. People need to read, learn, not get all your info from tweets &amp; YouTube videos. Spreading fake facts that science doesn&#39;t back hurts conservation efforts.

Global warming is something that is happening, but it is something that is not created by our emissions of fossil fuels, it is just the natural cycle of our planet. During the Cambrian era, atmospheric CO2 was around 7000 ppm or parts per million, compared to the atmosphere today which has a little over 400 ppm of atmospheric CO2. Additionally, the average temperature on our planet currently is 14 degrees Celsius, while it has been over 25 degrees celsius before. The Earth undergoes cycles in temperature, and we are currently heading out of an ice age, so the polar caps are natural going to be melting and temperatures are going to be increasing. The mainstream media will bring up the receding ice caps many times, misinforming audiences, because for millions of years there have been no ice caps on this planet, and life has still thrived. Climate change is real, but is not caused by our CO2 emissions. It is just a natural cycle on the Earth that will affect the environment around us, but since life was first on Earth species have died off and new ones have emerge. This is just what cruel mother nature does.	UCGiyBAJOC7lqP67YnXaqnkg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGiyBAJOC7lqP67YnXaqnkg	0

It was after the cambrian period where there was an explosion of all kinds of marine life. Cardon dioxide does get absorbed by the ocean, and the ocean keeps it balanced while producing oxygen. But when there's too much carbon dioxide the oceans acidity increases. And if I recall, most living things need a certain ph level to survive. Of course that excludes extremophiles.

Why do so many people think you can just relocate a wild polar bear to a "sanctuary" and it'll just be a happy go lucky cuddle bunny? Ask Timothy Treadwell and his girlfriend how messing with wild bears worked out. This bear is old. Old things die, including humans. We are very far removed from reality at this point.

According to EPA, agriculture (including animals AND plants) is *responsible for 24% of greenhouse gas emissions. Above that is Industry (such as waste management) and Electricity/Heat. Right below at 14% is transportation. If you REALLY want to help out the environment, stop using electricity/heat and don't use any motorized forms of transportation. That'll help more than not eating meat. Further, it's only big-scale agricultural facilities that use up so many resources. Smaller, free-range farms use significantly less....

Usually, polar bears will have a hunting season in the colder months. (in which they hunt seals on the ice that has reformed.) Then they don’t hunt in the warmer months because of the lack of ice, and wait until the ice reforms. Because of the overwhelming increase in fossil fuels, the world has become much warmer and is effecting the amount of time the polar bears have to go without eating. See, now that the earth is unnaturally warm, the warmer months in which polar bears do not hunt have increased by 6-7 weeks. This leads to starvation. Polar bears are starving due to climate change. I recommend you look into it. ;)	UCNBip_kbnSGz7mAenF1TdiQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNBip_kbnSGz7mAenF1TdiQ	1	Ugy3ABE5PFm58GTLAVB4AaABAg	Dennis S

And what happens the next day? And the day after that? What happens when you realize there's more than one bear in this situation? It's good to want to help, but giving one bear a little snack won't solve the problem...

May I also mention that nobody walks around with fish or seals. Even if they did, it would only prolong the death of the bear by an hour or so. Now don&#39;t misunderstand me. I am against the keeping of animals in zoos for the purpose of the public. However, in this particular case there was nothing left to do except to film and spread awareness so that this doesn&#39;t happen as often. It&#39;s sad, most humans are terrible. No one has any respect for this planet and we will learn that the hard way.	UCwyENEcNe3EEPv81fTWV-jw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwyENEcNe3EEPv81fTWV-jw	0

Once of the good example country is Sweden who successfully rid of the cloth factory to India so it made good balance in Sweden but horrible in India. To get more information/education I suggest you to search University courses about ECO. Very recommended for you to who wants to have a successfully business life with ECO system.

Unless whoever is maybe in charge of keeping them at least fed enough to have them strong to search food for themselves, maybe and hopefully this kind of photo would be rare from now on.

Otherwise its out of sight, out of mind. Whether you believe in climate change or not, i don't see anything wrong with wanting to live in a cleaner world. People 100+ years ago believed taking baths actually made you sick. People swore by it. Just like people today swear climate change isn't real. What we have done in a matter of 100 years is alarming.

It’s got no energy left and even if it did it’s hard for that bear to get to it’s main source of food. Second of humans are tertiary animals(which mean they have a big impact on their ecosystem) so anything we do like creating greater carbon emissions it’s gonna effect the polar bear and any other animal that has a relationship with the north and South Pole.

Everything which cause harm to environment should be illegal then!!!.<br />.<br />This polar bear is in this state because of humans- we humans- then we should take the responsibility to cure these problems too, this shouldn&#39;t be illegal... <br />.<br />Laws should be made equally for human and animals. <br />.<br />I really would have helped that polar bear, if i were there, instead of filming, no one&#39;s keeping an eye on you. <br />.<br />Please make a change. ..

They modified the names and the universities of the authors. That was the only thing they modified. They were the same studies. And then, they sent the studies to the same scientific journals. Here, 90% of the scientists that reviewed the studies have delivered a negative opinion in 90% of the cases, despite being the same studies that have been approved 2 or 3 years ago. Why? Because the scientists are biased, like everyone: they will more easily approve a study of a famous researcher. Also, the peer-reviewing is anonymous, so they scientists don't risk anything if they make a shoddy job. And finally, they aren't payed to do the review, so they won't really care.

I hunt, and there are many moments where the most humane thing to do is to kill the animal than to let nature take it&#39;s course. For example, many people disagree with Lion hunting, but they don&#39;t realize that most game reserves only hunt old males. Most of these olds males are males that have been run out of their old pack due to a younger male(s) taking over, on their own they will starve and die after a few weeks. They are too old to hunt effectively, and they are not used to it as their Lionesses did the hunting prior to this, they simply starve after a few weeks. It is more humane to give it an ethical death than to let it starve to death over a period of 2-3 weeks, yet people don&#39;t like it because all they see is an &quot;evil hunter&quot;.

They are probably brainwashed by the petroleum and gas companies. Do you guys really think that with this huge amount of CO2 and other harmful gases released into the atmosphere every passing minutes would have no consequences? I believed that the earth is also going through cycles but humans obviously contributed and speed up the process. Also know that those petroleum and gas companies do not care for these things, all they want is money.	UCj0W5Y-iWhwCQn1cE-qJBZw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj0W5Y-iWhwCQn1cE-qJBZw	0

Like humans, animals can get diseases that can cause this. For example if a polar bear gets cancer, he will slowly deteriorate, lose lots of weight, no longer be able to hunt for food until he eventually succumbs. Talking about ice is irrelevant to a polar bear starving as polar bears will eat any living creatures and many of the animals they prey on do not stay confined to ice areas. Seals for example who are one of their main sources of food can be found all over the earth from frigid cold places to the hottest places on earth. This is part of why I cut the cable some time ago as even networks like Discovery Channel and Nat Geo which once offered something in the way of educational shows have now started to inject political propaganda into their shows to socially engineer the sheep. Real science died a long time ago. Science now is dictated by coming to the conclusions the one giving you grants wants you to come to.

Mother Nature changes all the time and it is nearing the end for the polar bears. Unless we have another ice age I doubt this species will survive in the wild. When earth warms to temperatures it has already been at then other species will come alive and if it cools down again a similar polar bear like species of bear might evolve from the grizzly or already existing bear or a grolar bear. Or we could introduce captive bears to the wild if the earth cools again.	UCUILQ6n-qSKb-X91NWOAB9w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUILQ6n-qSKb-X91NWOAB9w	0

Due to its age, it is becoming increasingly more and more difficult for that bear to hunt and kill to survive. get a grip on reality, bozo.

We are the most superior creatures on Earth. God placed plants animals on Earth as food for us, the dominant species. The dinosaurs didn't complain whenever THEY killed something.

They are called *Polar* Bears for a reason, because they live in the Northern Pole. This video clearly proves you wrong. Polar Bears cannot survive in such drastically warm temperatures. If they could, they would be able to live way farther South in America, Asia, and Europe, but they don't. Why?????????? Because they thrive on ice and snow.

BTW, polar bears are doing very well. &quot;n the late sixties, the polar bear population was only about ten thousand. Polar Bears Today. Since earning protected status, the polar bear population has significantly improved. The World Wildlife Federation estimates that as of 2013, the population is between 20,000 and 25,000.&quot;	UCT7dt8zGmVgEhrzV4Plo7Kg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT7dt8zGmVgEhrzV4Plo7Kg	0

Where are those videos? 2) The bear clearly has an injured rear paw. What happens to predators who can no longer hunt? 3) There is no ice in these pictures. Should we take that to mean that there is no ice anywhere? 4) The polar bear population has increased from an estimated low of 5,000-10,000 in the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s to the present estimated range of 20,000-32,000. Does that square with the claims of this video? 5) The National Snow and Ice Data Center at the Univ. of Colorado reports that Arctic sea ice is up 40% since five years ago. Does that square with the claims of this video?	UCAnEzQg1CaTJeFQlg3piGqg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAnEzQg1CaTJeFQlg3piGqg	0

Almost more than half of the people have broken the law like Using someone else&#39;s WiFi without his permission, using someone else&#39;s copyrighted content and many other common things that most people do. That gives a clear view of how much importance do you give when compared to saving the life of an animal.<br />If I would have been there, I would have fed him because I love animals and I would save an animal&#39;s life inspite of the law(I respect the law but still I think that law was made so that people do not give junk food or some other stuff to the animals and that saving the life will not break the law. ) I am really sad by watching this!!!

You are a huge sack of meat, and so is the lone photographer who filmed this. I don't really have to tell you what happens when a tasty meatsack approaches a hungry polar bear head on. 2. The lone cameraman comviniently has a huge seal cub for the polar bear tied to his back. 3. This pretty much happens all the time in nature, where animals get too old or sick or injured to find food and starves to death. We shouldn't intervene as much as we can. 4. And also, try to understand that when death, comes life. The polar bear's body will serve food for many scavengers and renew the cycle of life again	UCMa9hUUDwf-Vpn2uP6RPgxA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMa9hUUDwf-Vpn2uP6RPgxA	1	UgzkDyLapGmP-IWH-Tp4AaABAg	carol banks

The other possible reason is because they'll wonder to human populated areas more often causing more bear related attacks/incidents. They're fully capable of feeding themselves and looking for food, theres obviously going to be a few that starve. just as humans.

But simply giving it some of your food wouldn’t have saved it. Only prolonged it’s pain because if you feed it then leave, it will only go back to searching for food and starve anyway. It’s not like they had a team right there ready to transport it. And they said it likely only had a few hours to live. There wasn’t any real way to save it for good. The best thing to do is quit bickering and instead make a change.	UCnZyCt5DSSHc6DE8sa-5I7g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnZyCt5DSSHc6DE8sa-5I7g	1	UgzkDyLapGmP-IWH-Tp4AaABAg	carol banks

That feeding animals, building habitats for them, and terraforming locations is a bad thing that is detrimental to life. The Earth is ONE LARGE ECOSYSTEM. We are already involved. Every action taken in life has an effect on everything else. We are the most capable species on this planet. If we wanted to- if the determination was there: We could build a better ecosystem. A better world.	UC-BQWhzlKjkhMFGhalntvag	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-BQWhzlKjkhMFGhalntvag	0

We constantly involve ourselves when we can reap benefits from it. So when a human says “it’s bad to involve yourself in nature” it just sounds like another empty platitude, We already constantly take, siphon and destroy with little regard – the empty words (it’s bad to get involved) are simply, to make us feel less guilt as we do it.

And it makes me mad that English isn't my first language and therefore it would be hard for me to explain that global warming is IN FACT real. Based on data of the past, based on how sun beams behave in the atmosphere, based on how pollution of air effects global waring. IT IS REAL and not just something you can decide to believe or not. Sea levels are rising alarmingly, the ice IS melting alarmingly, extreme droughts and heavy rains ARE happening much more. The earth had always had warm and cold periods of time but we currently are in a warm one, one that because of humans is more rapidly rising than any other over more than the last MILLION years and it doesn't seem to stop any time soon. Actually right now it is the second highest warm period in recorded history. People need to educate themselves!

Warmer oceans will cause more severe weather disturbances such as intense hurricanes and tsunamis, further causing havoc to our cities. The absence of our polar caps and glaciers will contribute to further warming since these ice caps help reflect the sun’s heat back into space. Without them, the planet will absorb the sun’s heat more.	UCr4UoExq_Xj8hstLHBhydNw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr4UoExq_Xj8hstLHBhydNw	1	UgyMYLrZzqIDkqssJNF4AaABAg	Jori DellaGrotte Vlogs

It is not a small feat to warm all the oceans, land and the atmosphere by even 1 degree. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the warmest 30 year period is between 1983 to 2012. Human activities continue to emit large amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere in spite of efforts to reduce our carbon footprint.

This bear has an obvious injury to his left rear leg and has not been able to hunt or travel to better hunting ground. Please don&#39;t be fooled! Research &quot;geo-engineering&quot; and learn what these aerosol metals being sprayed by our governments are doing to our planet. We are told it is to &quot;combat&quot; climate change, when in fact it the very reason we are seeing change, especially the catastrophic wildfires. People, do you want to help our planet and it&#39;s animals? Stop believing the lies! Do your research and find the real cause. We are being fooled and we are blindly accepting this as truth.

If they survived an ice age, multiple valcanic eruptions, and other severe weather changes, they may survive. Whatever the cause, animals have NO choice but adapt or die to the changes in the weather. The planet has never been on a set cycle, as the temperature changes prove it. Going from Ice Age to extreame heating, Climate change cannot do a 180° turn and go back to normal gradual changes. These animals suffer at the hands of an uncontrollable force called nature. Who ever thought setting off over 2k nuclear bombs was a good idea. Just reminds me of my favorite games, from the Fallout series. A land full of creatures that adapted to the change.

By the way, the polar ice regions weren't really scheduled for any major change (without human interference) for another few million years. Just because "survival of the fittest" is a thing, doesn't give us any excuse to cause such drastic changes in the first place. Stop making up excuses for mankind. We don't deserve any. The only thing that will really fix any of this is an acceptance that we've done wrong and to go from there.

You would have to kill a healthy animal to feed a sick dying animal that won&#39;t live much longer anyhow. And that would only be one meal. How many healthy animals are you willing to sacrifice for a sick elderly bear at the end of his life.	UCbCZrrzOI15fi-7FnNROJAA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbCZrrzOI15fi-7FnNROJAA	0

The issue is that as the earth heats up the ice melts earlier, and the bears have to make a choice to either continue hunting on the ice or swim to shore. Bears require a HUGE amount of calories to survive; most of their diet is pure fat and some single meals are upwards of 20k calories. The prey and berries available on land can't provide anywhere near enough calories, and the competition with the local brown bear populations doesn't help. You are correct that the bear didn't get enough to eat while it was on the ice, but it has a lot to do with the fact it had less time to do so. This lack of calories was further worsened by the swim to shore, which uses up a lot of their fat stores.

But polar bears should be well fed enough in the winter to survive on stored fat during summer months... clearly it wasn't fed enough in winter, prior to the melting ice... resulting in less stored fat and.... sadly, starvation... :(	UCWMli7KqIlwG-rmlZzkI1DQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWMli7KqIlwG-rmlZzkI1DQ	1	UgwVXBLF5T-F24j3v6p4AaABAg	Mortarman Jim

Your ignorance of the disaster makes it worse. Our government not only does nothing to stop it, they are actively ignoring the advice of 97% of climate scientists by reverting back to the policies and deregulation that started it.

Baffin island has had one of the coldest winters in 20 years. -31 was the highest temp from Dec 1st to Feb 27. Minus 51 was the low. Anyone on the island will tell you that Polar's have probably doubled the last 20 years, eating out of the city dumps and people not putting all they're food products in the locked garbage boxes is a problem seals and ice are far from it. 1972 they estimated 30,000 bears, Today 50,000.

First, much of this video was played in slow motion. Second, male Polar Bears molt EVERY May/June - they lose all their fur - so ignore this bear&#39;s ratty coat. Thirdly - I would hazard a guess that this bear was tranquilized which accounts for its dopey state at the outset of the video. Much like that Polar Bear that was floating on a small ice floe- looking like it was stranded. That rocked the hand-wringing world - and then we found out that the flow was actually only about 20 feet from shore and shortly after the picture was taken, the bear lazily swam to shore. PT Barnum had it right - there&#39;s a sucker born every minute.	UCs3FNdXWCoHhlLN_wR_kYBw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs3FNdXWCoHhlLN_wR_kYBw	0

The cows of the world expel more greenhouse gas than all the cars and planes combined. This is not to deny that greenhouse gasses trap in heat, but my point is that it is a complex issue and we overestimate our puny scale in a system as massive as the Earth. We need to reduce our impact, but it can't be forced. If we halved the supply of fossil fuels tomorrow, billions of people will starve or freeze to death. A replacement tech doesn't exist yet	UCClNc7BQgRngVLv38gUuQfg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCClNc7BQgRngVLv38gUuQfg	1	UgwuGJb2CTvMhAGJK_d4AaABAg	ant36au

Its not likely but without 100% certainty or some kind of biopsy of the animal then global warming could have caused the death. #2 Even if the bear didn't die due to global warming it doesn't prove that global warming is not happening or false. In fact global warming is happening whether you like it or not. No amount of praying will wish it away. And don't even get me started on how praying is bulshitt. Chemistry and physics tell us that carbon dioxide has a special property to absorb heat energy and it lingers in our atmosphere. Dont quote me on that because i forget exactly how it works. Its a greenhouse gas and acts as a blanket to the earth trapping heat. The burning of fossil fuels (which provides transportation, electricity and heat for homes) releases enormous amounts of CO2 in the atmosphere. Also the greenhouse gases are water methane. I think nitrous oxide but don't quote me i forget exactly.	UCPqhJxUCWS8n6NNqxsHrQZQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPqhJxUCWS8n6NNqxsHrQZQ	1	UgwuGJb2CTvMhAGJK_d4AaABAg	ant36au

If it was deemed so important, one could have laid down their life for this animal. Leave their ecosystem alone. Your footsteps create much more damage than realized. 2. If Dinosaurs were witnessed going extinct it would now have an instrumental played alongside the process. 3. If playful polar bears are captured on film is the negative propaganda spewed on that clip as well. 4. Things die all the time. 5. Fake News!

In other words, nature is almost no longer on autopilot mode because &quot;scientists&quot; just had to put their noses into it.

Sure they have probably killed humans,but its because THEY'RE HUNGRY! We humans are known for destroying their homes, ruining their food sources, and killing them, I can assure you we've killed way more of them, and done way more damage. Its our own fault ...

Firstly back in the 60's there was no way to document how many polar bears there were. Basically it was just uneducated guesses that were far ranging and had no scientific merit behind them. Secondly some areas technically have seen population increases due to the banning of polar bear hunting so of course you are going to see numbers in those areas rebound. Thirdly it is irrelevant what happened in the past as it is a proven fact that their natural habitat is decreasing and this is why we are seeing images like this. Polar bears are having to travel further inland to try and find food due to the ice not extending as far out to the sea so that they can hunt seals during the winter months. Your argument that the bear in the video could be elderly has no merit as we simply do not know. An elderly bear is not going to look like skin and bones just because they are old. Are all elderly humans skin and bones? No.	UClII4t5JRLiQSgYH8n9r67g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UClII4t5JRLiQSgYH8n9r67g	1	UgybkjMqsTaofYu7y_R4AaABAg	hannah villarreal

Is it possible that the seals changed their migration habits near Baffin Islands? Is is possible that the seals are being so heavily hunted that we are causing a foot shortage for the polar bears? How do we know that climate changed affected this bear directly? Since when do we take videos from videographers as proof for scientific claims versus scientists with their &quot;full&quot; test results. Just a thought.

These programs are being conducted by scientists and governments around the world without our knowledge. They are trying to play God with the climate and destroying ecosystems. If you care about the climate and want to understand what is going on, go to Geoengineering <a href="http://watch.com/">watch.com</a> to learn the truth. They have been manipulating the weather since the 1940s. Do a YouTube search for a film called “Frankenskies” and you will see proof of what has been happening.

They are increasing in number however, their population is now enough to have a healthy gene pool, trouble is loss of habitat and prey, they will have another drop in numbers, and may never recover, depends if some of them can adapt fast enough (unlikely) and with more people slowly migrating north, their odds are even lower	UCBO4_KPY-48gEuJboXUUdCw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBO4_KPY-48gEuJboXUUdCw	1	Ugz9LY4XHtJt-7DhINR4AaABAg	Mr. NPC

You admit climate change is happening and your answer is that all animals including us simply adapt to it? You think I should keep my stupidity to myself? If you understood any part of evolution we would not be having this argument. As climate, over millions of years on our Earth, has changed very slowly over time allowing species to adapt to it or migrate to survive moron. Where do you suggest the Polar Bears migrate to or do you suggest they lose their thick fur coats overnight, develop wings and live wherever they please? Your level of understanding on the subject is disturbing to say the least. If you are completely ignorant on the subject keep your idiotic false statements to yourself. "Evolve or Die" Yeah evolution happens over a period of millions of years in tiny increments. If you would have read a science book anywhere you would know this.

As the temperature on Earth rises it will literally change the climate around the Earth. Therefore, destroying tropical rain forests and turning them into deserts. I guess you will say the species there should adapt to the desert like environment or die too right? Do you have any idea what warmer regions would look like if the poles became fully tropical? The only inhabitable place on Earth would be around the poles. The rest of the planet would almost literally be a desert that supported little or no plant life.

Therefore, let&#39;s show emotional propaganda of a polar bear slowly dying as it starves. Even though that is no proof of climate change. It just means the bear is sick.

Sounds like more of an upgrade if you ask me<br /><br />And if everything does die in global warming it would be for the better of the planet as the balanced is restored overtime somthin might just spark again <br /><br />As for humans dieing out, that would do way better for the planet than if all of us worked to better it.

Especially in more complicated ways since we evolved to be very smart and logical. Most of our laws are not for wild animals cause they don't live in our society. Although animal abuse is against the law and you can get fined up to $5000 so that means the government does care about animals. You are not thinking about the positive side of humans. The government even allows people make efforts help animals. We have organizations, charities and YouTube videos that spread awareness for issues like this.

I&#39;ll bet you say...We&#39;re not permitted to get involved in the course of nature. Hmmm. <br />The humane thing to do, finding yourself in a position where you could help the endangered animal, would be to feed the starving animal. You&#39;ll sure try to get people all teary eyed for the poor suffering endangered animal, but you won&#39;t do anything while you&#39;re right there and could make a difference.

How do anthropogenic Carbon Dioxide emissions explain the end of the last Ice Age (roughly 11,700 years ago)?<br /><br />Assuming your answer is &quot;they don&#39;t,&quot; i.e., accurate:<br />2. How do &quot;Climate Change models&quot; mathematically control for whatever forces DID cause Ice Age(s) to come and go repeatedly between 1 million and 20,000 years Before the Present?<br /><br />Assuming your answer is &quot;they don&#39;t,&quot; i.e., accurate:<br />3. Why do you assume the forces which have caused dramatic climate fluctuations in Earth&#39;s climate during the past million years can simply be omitted from models which intend to account for human influences on contemporary climate?<br /><br />4. What about other factors besides human forces?<br /><br />I have yet to encounter a single individual who espouses &quot;climate change alarm&quot; notions who has been able to succinctly, sincerely, and completely answer these questions.<br /><br />Now with respect to the bear, nothing about this video demonstrates any linkage between any aspect of weather or climate and the behavior or status of the bear. You should be ashamed for using clickbait, and appeals to emotion backed with zero empirical basis to promote a religious cult. Shame on your Nat Geo.

How is it not real where Greenland is losing inches of ice each year. People say that’s since getting colder I America how is that global warming. Well simple science cold water=cold air. Water flows in current from each pole of the earth to the equator. Causing the ice thats melting, the water cold and the current pushing the cold water down along with the air. So global warming is real for all of you idiots that disagree.	UCPNDW-RNd4YrUeuSK5cZm4A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPNDW-RNd4YrUeuSK5cZm4A	0

That has been done countless number of times. Arguing climate change isn’t real rn is basically discrediting almost every since scientist on the planet. Are you even in the scientific community? I doubt it. Like seriously there is a lot of evidence of climate change... it’s not some correlation. Large oil companies knew all the way back in the 60’s and 70’s that it existed but intentionally lied to the public. We shouldn’t be arguing wether it’s real or not. You can look at the data (it’s public obviously) but if you even understand it... that would surprise me Now I agree that this could be considered propaganda since it appeals to emotion and doesn’t present any information but it would be a waste of time for them to do so. Most Americans already know it exists and National Geographic viewers do too.

The National Geographic photographer was there and able to study the environment and possible ways the bear could’ve gotten in that state There are more animals suffering the consequences of global warming but the photographer was at the right place at the right time so it’s a perfect example People are too stubborn to believe hose facts and accept the evidence so they use a visual alternative that strikes what makes us human (emotions) If we look at glacier difference and ice at the poles from the 1980s and now here is a big difference, there are also large chunks of ice breaking from Antarctica, and yes the correlation between CO2 gases and temperature This evidence concludes this is a threat and could be devastating but like i said people don’t believe it or are too lazy. That is why NG goes from an emotional standpoint. There are some making a difference though, for example the Paris climate accord and the construction of renewable energy resources	UCi4f1u-P5_gZrnutXPLPhKQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi4f1u-P5_gZrnutXPLPhKQ	1	UgzbrcGs4evCpUXoC214AaABAg	Alessandro Bressani

How do we know this bear is starving from global warming? Bears starve all the time; it's what animals do. It's misleading to jump to the conclusion to say this is caused by global warming. Also, why are we focusing on bears in the first place, except to appeal to emotions? Why is the video played in slow motion? All of this is because it's appealing to emotions. Appeal to pity, is a logical fallacy. It's also a fallacy under the propaganda subsection of logical fallacies. "global warming already has enough facts and evidence to prove its existence." Then shouldn't National Geographic be focusing on this evidence, instead of appealing to emotions which only causes a unstable belief in global warming? I'd argue it's not conclusive. It's evidence, but not really proven. The best evidence for human-cause global warming is a *correlation* between CO2 and temperature. "or they are just to lazy to do anything" Or, because it's not a real threat, and we'd rather spend our time and energy fixing real issues. Fixing global warming (regulating CO2 emissions, jacking up prices for electricity, etc), only leads to a lower standard of living, and possible more human deaths in third world countries. If you want to fix global warming, we need to find ways to lower CO2 emissions through innovation, without regulations that could cause human deaths.

It'd be laughable if people took their responsibility and check the numbers that are propagandized, and call out the real reasons these sobbing stories are spread, but they don't. If anything is unworthy of nature it's the humans that appeal to anything that conforms to their wish of destroying mankind, and more so the people that propagandize that viewpoint.

If you really thought it was sad and wanted to help you should actually do something about it. I&#39;m not an expert on global warming but I think what causes it is gas from cars and all the fires. So if you wanted to help you should walk to places that are close by instead of using your car and you should try to prevent starting a fire. You should also not litter cause it ends up in the oceans ans kills millions of sea creatures.	UChbhnLwGPJBxnKCZLlA7gow	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UChbhnLwGPJBxnKCZLlA7gow	0

The biggest issue contributing to the greenhouse gases is the animal agriculture around the globe. The vast number of livestock bred for dairy or meat production far exceeds the population from vehicles. Cows for example produce an insane amount of methane gas that gets trapped within the atmosphere. It is also a problem on the west coast as far as the 'drought' in California is concerned. The amount of water required to produce a pound of ground beef is just insane. I agree though, in the 'first world' almost all of us are guilty for saying we are saddened or moved by something like this, but then we push it out of our minds and look for something else to distract us. I'm not saying we should all become vegans to solve the problem, but cutting back on your consumption of meat is one way to help. Technically humans are not meant to be meat eaters if you look at our teeth as a prime example. Of course many people are going to disagree with what I said simply because they are ignorant to the ideals that have been proven to be true, but that lobbyist groups have worked hard to convince us are untrue. This is how it always goes. Decades ago there was a doctor who presented sound facts that proved sugar and not fat was the culprit for causing surges in weight gain and health issues, but the sugar consortium spent millions to discredit the doctor and when he died he was seen as a disgrace. However now we finally know he was absolutely right. This is the same thing happening now as the dairy and meat producers are getting all this credible information just swept under the rug. Don't believe everything you read online. Fossil fuels do add to the problem, but it is a drop in the bucket compared to what I outlined above. One thing we could do to slightly mitigate things is stop feeding cows corn. They are biologically not made to eat the stuff. This is why they produce excessive methane, have digestive problems, and why we are getting new strains of e-coli contaminating our food and water supply.

Americans are consuming less beef, whole milk, chicken, etc., which has dropped diet-related greenhouse gas emissions.The analysis "just shows that small changes in our diets have impacts," said Sujatha Bergen, a food specialist at the Natural Resources Defense Council. (InsideClimateNews.org) Of course, the biggest change would come from the government and industries themselves stopping environmental abuse. I have no political power right now, but I can try to make my own change, however small that may be. I have definitely thought it was impossible and not cared for the longest time, but I cannot live like that.

Livestock and their byproducts account for more than half of greenhouse gas emissions worldwide, and that was estimated in 2009 by Worldwatch (that number has definitely gone up since). As for food production, there IS enough food to feed more than 10 billion people (right now, there around 7 billion of us). However, that food is given to cows, pigs, etc. which humans breed purposefully more of due to our evergrowing "need" of animal consumption. In an ideal world, everyone would be vegan. My family is not vegan and even when I try to be, they misinterpret it and gift me food that contains animal products (eggs, dairy, fish); so even I am not vegan. Only a few of my friends are. However, I see more and more people becoming vegan, and even my mother, who would eat animal fat in every meal, is buying less meat. There are more plant-based options you can ask for in restaurants. People are changing, but the idea of everyone becoming vegan might be scary. That changes cultures and even beliefs. I get it. I do.

Just looking at the amount of waste and land used for animal agriculture increase drastically over the years is overwhelming. Of course, people would probably rather walk than stop eating bacon and burgers, but that honestly is such a small change compared to what would happen if we started to stop supporting big animal factory farms. If you think you can't make a difference in the world any other way, you're wrong- you can start with what you choose to put on your plate.

If someone actively using bad arguments to make his position look stronger (And all purely emotion-based arguments are BAD, especially when they using false presupposition, like this situation) - it means he does not have good arguments or consider good arguments too weak. In both cases his positions become extremely questionable. Next, fight against global warming and fight against world hunger - is not a same thing. Actually, this is a contradictory things. If you fight global warming, you increase world hunger. And last, but not least - do you even know the meaning of corruption? That's how government doing things which harm economy, like in this case.

As a response, I said they (logic and emotions) are complementary, yes one exists without the other. Yes just like how this propaganda (no personal views on the subject) convinced people solely appealing with emotions, people have appealed with logic before. You're better off trying to convince people with both. So if you only appeal to logic, putting it simply, you're not logical. You're wasting your time trying to convince someone with the meat without the spices. (Lol bad analogy) Why do people do illogical things in the name of love? I mean technically, if you were logical, shouldn't you be able to understand how it all works? But that doesn't explain the underlying emotional aspect. Just because you're logical, doesn't mean you understand. Which is why technically, this would indicate that you're (as in directed to a general audience and not just you) not logical. Logical people also don't take biases toward an open minded subject. Yes I consider this openminded as there are both pro and cons to believing in climate change.

It's not rational to not listen to your emotions and vice versa. Humans like to think they're logical, but they're not logically perfect. If someone told you that killing a murderer would save ten more lives, would you do it? Perhaps it's rational to assume to do so, and emotionally, you might think no, killing someone is bad. However, if you think outside the box, analyze the situation, apply emotions along with logic you may realize that perhaps instead of Killing him, make it so that he can't kill anyone else. Which might seem obvious, but you're applying both emotion and logic to this conclusion. Also, let's talk about climate change since your belief is that it's propaganda and there's no good reason to believe it. That's seems logical, but is it really logical to assume that saving a bit water, electricity to stop climate change, even if it's unnecessary and promoting an imaginary problem, a bad thing? At most, you're wasting a few seconds of your life. I mean technically you even save money. Emotionally and morally, it'll help you feel better about yourself. Even if climate change isn't real, pollution is. World hunger is. So tell me, people who believe solely in being logical... You can't only be logical without listening to your emotions. Your emotions tell you what's morally wrong. Plus, no matter how logical you try to be, you're still going to be wrong every once in a while if you don't be a little bit more self aware. We have instincts for behavior, perhaps sometimes we need to control them, but we also need to know how to use them instead of just neglecting them. Climate change is "propaganda" (no personal opinions). I find it hard to believe that the government would spread propaganda about something that doesn't benefit the economy. You know what would benefit the economy?	UCvmEL_4YivlTHH8IVFieQmQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvmEL_4YivlTHH8IVFieQmQ	1	UgwmCZw5F4epWzBrPqh4AaABAg	Johnus Smittinis

But I do not agree that you can never reach people with logic. With enough facts or evidence, you can definitely reach people. The problem is, when people don't have *enough* evidence, they result to appealing emotions (because that's the only way to push their agenda). *Again, emotions are manipulated so easily, to the point of being so unstable, that we should not use it to determine our principles. Logic and facts cannot be manipulated near as easily. Our emotions cannot determine what is right or wrong, while logic and facts can.* People who appeal to emotions (to push their agenda) are the ones who cannot support their stance enough with evidence to reach people.

Still doesn't explain why we shouldn't put efforts into a solution rather than a delay. "Logic and emotions, though may seem contradictory, both are complementary." The problems with emotions is that they can be manipulated by anyone. That's why fake news has been so rampant. A fake story designed to incite anger will stir up people so bad that, before checking if it's true or false, they make judgments based on it, and share it. That's why news appealing to emotions is so effective, but so faulty in dealing with issues. It's called propaganda. Emotions are great for individual interaction with people, but policies based on emotions? Not so much. Emotions never help to find out what is true or false because of their malleability. Logic, on the other hand, is far more stable. I'd argue, that through logic we can even reach absolutes, not just subjective principles based on emotions (ex. "that makes me mad. It's wrong.")

I could see that being the case if we knew the world was going to end or something, but we have hundreds or thousands of years, and adding 5 or 10 years of delay is not going to help find a solution. We should ditch the efforts to delay it, and put all efforts into a real solution. "Isn't that the Paris Accords?" I didn't mean just delaying it. I mean that we actually need enough countries under enough heavy regulations as a solution, to stop completely or reverse climate change.

Then, another thing to be looked into is how much human activity is raising the CO2. Maybe more efforts should go into proving causation? What I want most of all, is one to figure out the main causes of climate change, figure out the cons & pros, and provide *real* solutions if it's too negative. Real solutions, as not just *delaying* climate change, but stopping it altogether. Unless we can get all major nations to agree on certain regulations, the most any of us can do is delay the warming of the earth about 2 years. What is 2 years to us, when we hurt the economy with all these regulations? The problem with appealing to emotions, is that it's not based on facts or evidence. I could very well find some example of a species benefiting from climate change, and use that to appeal to emotions. Does that make global warming good? No. Appealing to emotions does not help to figure out what is right and wrong. All it does is misleads people to action.

Appealing to people's emotions is the foundation of propaganda, and is how propaganda is so effective. The issue here is, that climate change has absolutely nothing to do with this polar bear in this video. We have no idea why the bear is starved. Lack of seals, due to less ice, due to climate change is one major leap from just seeing a starving bear. Animals will starve no matter where you are in the world. The implication of video is, that if we fight against climate change, we can stop this. *That's a lie,* since it is not clear *at all* whether this bear is starving because of climate change or natural processes.

The only reason we dont have as many polar bears in zoos is because someone hasnt made out how to make money out of it like china did with its pandas´<br />Who here would be against this specific polar bear being in a zoo ? It would live in confort and may yet come to produce offspring that could save the species, but no, let it die and lets move on to the next sad video	UCwkjAHi5scFT1gstprzDBQg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwkjAHi5scFT1gstprzDBQg	0

Just look at the entire earth and the amount of undeveloped land out there with jungles and such and you seriously believe that we puny people are so mighty we can take down an earth we didn’t create? Ha!!! Such a funny thought. The world will have come to an end by 2150 maybe but not by human hands. We think too highly of ourselves don’t we. So mighty and powerful we can ruin an entire planet and it’s inhabitants. Arrogant much? Stop listening to politicians and scientists.

You can’t expect the whole world to alter its way of life for 1 species of animals. Besides animals go extinct all the time. Completely normal. Polar bears have been around a long time and during times much warmer than today even. They survived. Let’s be real, a starving polar bear doesn’t mean the species is going extinct. There are starving people and yet we are far from going extinct.	UCDA5YnTGHX50D3LuLqI-UjQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDA5YnTGHX50D3LuLqI-UjQ	0

Even if they had fed it at that point in time, his/her food supply would still be insufficient, and it would only prolong the inevitable. The only way to help these animals is to look at the bigger picture and restore their habitat.

It&#39;s our fault that there is climate change with our stupid factories and everything. Animals own the planet as much as we do and deserve more. I know you could argue saying that we kill them, they kill us and each other but that&#39;s for food. The polar bear was starving because of rise in tempature. Soon there will be no artic and Antarctic and a lot less land because of sea level rising. In many generations to come we probably will evolve into some weird creature with gills. This is all due to climate change and how we are shaping the world. These starving animals are only the beginning of the change and it will get much worse unless we find some other resource that works as well as oil and petrol and does not harm the atmosphere. Just think for a second and imagin the possibilities. These are just my thoughts.	UCAl5lKeSiyxNTQ7NNK8IiEQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAl5lKeSiyxNTQ7NNK8IiEQ	0

Animals starve all the time, that doesn&#39;t mean the world is coming to an end.

I guess not, you would be interveining in the natural course of life which is not a good thing to do, and also it's counterproductive to feed every starving animal you see, they will get used to humans giving them food and will start to look for humans instead of looking for food. The point of filming the bear was to show how climate change is affecting them and their habitat, but saving an animal dying of natural causes is not what you should do. Even more so, we don't even know if it was actually dying of starvation due to climate change, it could also be sick, old or injured.

BUT there is CONCRETE proof that the current change in climate doesn’t follow other natural climate changes. Also, if you believe that the climate began changing when people where starting to get a lot of cars and factories were opening, was JUST a coincidence you are truly on a whole new level of stupid. So don’t be stupid, stupid. Also quick side note; democratic socialism with a capitalist market, is the ‘combo’ that has been proven to be the best for the economy, life satisfaction, and personal income.

In the post a person mentioned the odds of it being sick due to a parasite or disease is much more likely than starvation. NatGeo social media team responded and said, "It's very likely the polar bear contracted some type of disease because other polar bears seen within the same vicinity are quite healthy". Their post continued, explaining how diseases lead to starvation, in their comment they also mentioned an average weight of a fully matured polar bear is about 1300lbs. Furthermore they explained they estimated the polar bear to weight about 600lbs. Lastly they concluded mentioning to reach this state the polar bear would have to not eat or eat very lightly for an estimated 2.5-3 months.

I cannot comprehend why people are commenting &quot;good, if they can&#39;t adapt, let them die off&quot;. We are driving countless species to extinction, losing magnificent life that took millions of years to form. If you look at this and can only think of how this is &quot;propaganda&quot; and that climate science is wrong - nobody can help you, you need some serious soul searching to do.

This bear was a sad example of that .<br /><br />Many people would say that there&#39;s no climate change or there&#39;s no global warming; they either are people responsible for this or they just don&#39;t know<br /><br />I hope all the big industries burning fossil fuel, deforesting huge areas for farming etc understand that there&#39;s gonna be no winners if we lose this planet of ours. And also that they will pay for their greedy actions .<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />long rant, but my opinions matter	UCk7j2g5Hgmp6dl7yyU1jgIw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk7j2g5Hgmp6dl7yyU1jgIw	0

At this point and time, our very being requires us to have it for our world to thrive and it might be to late to really change anything. I havnt really looked at the argument for global warming so I don&#39;t really have an opinion on it, I do know that we can&#39;t just stop using fuels. Wh have a system built from the last hundred years that will not be going away without years of regulation and change. I mean let&#39;s assume the US completely stopped using fossil fuels as our primary source, we would be dumb to believe any other nations would stop using them. Also 3rd world nations aren&#39;t worried about global warming that&#39;s a 1st world problem, that could care less about a polar bear dying. Having said that I do believe it is our responsibility to take care of our plants and animals, but at this point is it too late to do anything before they die? So let&#39;s be honest folks, everyone complaining about this polar bear dying doesn&#39;t really care, they&#39;ll leave a &quot;global warming is real comment&quot; and go back to using fossil fuels. So honestly the only people that can say &quot;OMG pollution is killing the polar bears we need to stop&quot; are literally people who don&#39;t use any fossil fuel based energy, bikes/ walks and lives in a dark cave cause ya can&#39;t make light. Now excuse me while I go and stay warm in my house cause idgaf.	UC2JVS5Ztpw1o65IEk2Lq3CA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2JVS5Ztpw1o65IEk2Lq3CA	0

We can easily use the outlets we get on everyday to fight for a planet that can flourish! Selfishness is what kills, and we are bound to die, maybe not right now, but eventually our time will come!

The truth behind this video was that the camera crew went up to Canada and found this one poor creature, at the end stages of its life and with some other health issues, and filmed it alone to create a fictitious narrative. Now if they had filmed 100&#39;s, or even dozens of polar bears like this one, they may have a truthful story to tell. Shame on you National Geographic. Shame on you.

We save a few bears....increase the number of trees...cool down the earth a little. But if it is true and people thought it was fake..the best that could happen is the end of all humanity due to scarcity of resources and a polluted environment that we very well deserved . The worst thing is , a lot of innocent creatures are killed and forever wiped out of existence and a beautiful life supporting planet is destroyed due to our stupidity and arrogance.

If starvation was happening, shouldn&#39;t there be other bears with him also starving? Possibly some nearby that have died. This photographer is using emotional images to stir up people to a cause. There is no due process in finding out why this bear is truly the way he is. And that is the greatest shame of all.

Ugyi6_Hlg9luGvHJENh4AaABAg	0	0	2017-12-12 17:37:43	EmmausRoad	This is a horrible play on the emotions done in an exceedingly irresponsible manner. We don&#39;t know anything about this polar bear. He/she could be diseased, could have sustained an injury that curtailed its ability to hunt or any number of things. To automatically label it the result of &quot;Global Warming&quot; is an obvious attempt to fire up peoples emotions to what may or may not be the truth. The TRUTH is that the glaciers and the two poles have frozen and melted perhaps hundreds of times in earths history. It is part of a natural cycle the earth goes through approximately every fifteen to twenty thousand years. Humans have only had technology and industry on a large scale for the last two hundred years. Each time the earth goes through this cycle some species suffer, while others thrive. The seals for instance are given a reprieve from the relentless hunting of the bears. While it is obvious that we should all have deep compassion for the suffering of all living things, to get emotionally charged about a highly manipulative video is not in the slightest way helpful to that bear, or nature in general. It has also been proven that the polar bear and the grizzly and the brown bear are essentially the same species that broke off into separate groups with the advance of the ice sheets around eighteen thousand years ago. Since they have been thrust back into proximity with each other due to the receding ice, they have interbred. Several of these specimens have been found by naturalists and hunters. The hunters, baffled by the unusual coat of these bears had them DNA tested and they were found to be the progeny of a grizzly/polar bear cross. It is in fact a good idea and the law to not feed polar bears, but really? A team could not have been sent out to tend to THIS bear and find out if it was disease or an injury (which is the more likely cause of its condition)? We have hundreds of wildlife rescue operations all over the world constantly tending to species that it is unlawful to feed. This is a bogus, politically charged and created video designed to get the exact reaction it did from all these commentors... emotional. National Geographic again shows it complete lack of compassion for the actual animals it claims to care for. I am disgusted not only by this video, but the lack of outrage by these commentors. What this photographer did was to sacrifice the well being of this animal for the &quot;shot&quot;. Disgusting... a final note, in the question and answer section, NG admits they do not know if the polar bear was diseased or not, that on the whole polar bear populations around the world are doing fine and that the photographer opted NOT to assist the bear for his own personal safety. I rest my case...	UCppO7K2E8L-S_4r8XlSs1uA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCppO7K2E8L-S_4r8XlSs1uA	0

As I said that this is the gravity, gravity pulls, and so, that object either is hurled away from the gravitational pull, or completely falls into it. We are being PULLED by this star called the Sun, and if you didn&#39;t already know, stars are VERY dense. Density in objects often make their pull stronger. Now add up the math.

It is unknown if the bear is sick or injured or coming out of hibernation or old and is going to feed. A lack of ice has nothing to do with this bear being skinny. A lack of ice would provide more food because its prey would be out of hibernation as well. Again this is just more propaganda. Seems no news site will cover the story that came out last month of a weather satellites data over the past 26 years that showed no temperature change over that time. It is all garbage. Remember El Niño? Remember the giant hole in the ozone that was over the South Pole in the 80’s and 90’s? Where are they now? Disappeared. The earth heats and cools itself over cycles. Core drilling has proven this has been the case for thousands of years. Remember the Time magazine cover in the 60’s saying “Global Cooling?” I do. It is all about money and control.

Not only that, but the climate as a whole has changed drastically (I wish I knew English well enough so I could explain this deeply)... An example of this is the Atacama Desert, the north and south of Chile (my country), etc. Maybe this isn't caused solely on the humans, but climate change is happening and I don't believe that that can be denied.

If it was a issue ALL of the worlds scientists would agree. The fact is less than half believe in climate change while the rest do not because THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A STUDY ACTUALLY DONE JUST TO STUDY IT ITSELF. Never. Plus the people in Sweden who study core samples for almost a decade are not invited or allowed at so called climate change summits to show this warming and cooling occurs naturally. Like I said. It is all about money and power and control. I choose to read and learn not to be a sheep and follow.

Those temperatures were fake by the way, there's plenty of proof of temperature change. Polar bears have lived in the arctic who knows how long hunting seals and whatever else that lives there. I'm taking a good guess that anything that has lived in that environment has moved north as a result of the melted ice caps. The polar bears would have to compete with bears living in a region without ice for food, which the other bear would obviously be able to obtain easier since it has experience hunting said prey and traversing iceless land. There's a lot of holes and false information in your theory but I get where you're coming from. The next fifty years won't be pleasant for you.

We don't say what it is--we know what we know about it from sheer observation. We're not defining it, it defines itself. Existing alongside something is not inherently being a "part of". Yes, we exist alongside nature, and we came from it, but we are no longer participating in it the same way that other organisms are. We have placed ourselves outside of that road, and the way of life that goes along with that road. Your examples are simply listing ways that we influence and exist next to nature, not examples of us following nature's logic... I mean, we can agree to disagree, but honestly I don't think you're understanding the nuance between these ideas. And, for the record, I would love for us to be a part of nature, not apart from it.

Do we live on the earth=yes, do we eat other organisms=yes, do we have fear=yes, did we adapt to our environment=hell yeah, seems like we're still part of nature	UCc_leUR_rQGYUmOLEPEWzGA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc_leUR_rQGYUmOLEPEWzGA	1	Ugy-DNw8hTdjjdHaE494AaABAg	Maplehouse Knives

As in, we no longer follow the same logic that nature does. Nature doesn't account for abstractions that are unique to humans, like wealth, power, fame, etc. Nature optimizes, not maximizes, for example, and it works in cycles. We have done everything in our power to break these rules--we take without returning, we push for the next best thing without considering its sustainability. In that sense, yes, we have placed ourselves outside of nature's rationale, and that is dangerous.

Ugy350ETk1vcBPSUXS14AaABAg	0	0	2017-12-12 14:14:00	Griffin Darnutzer	For all the idiots in the comments denying climate change, here are the facts: for thousands of years the atmospheric co2 levels have been at around 300 ppm. Within the past 60 years it had risen to over 400 ppm. This is causing global warming. Ice caps are melting, the coral reefs are dying, and species are beginning to get confused which can lead to extinction. The coral reefs are also a hugely important environment for sea life. Without coral reefs, many species of fish will die off because they have no where to hide. This will impact many islands near the Philippines because they rely on the ocean life for food. If you don’t think global warming is having an effect on this planet you are dead wrong. Scientists estimate that within the next 35-40 years the coral reefs will all be gone. This will cause mass extinctions and effect human life as well as animal life. At this stage, anyone who doesn’t believe in global warming needs to get their facts straight.

This is why the Paris Accord was such a shit show, charging the American Taxpayer for doing what we are already accomplishing. If you&#39;re wanting to make an impact whine at China and India, they&#39;ve got hundreds of new coal plants in the works. Or do you fk&#39;n hippies want us all living in shit huts with nothing but the flowers in our hair to keep us warm?<br /><br />I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re editing this video in an air conditioned office building, much like Al Gore or Leonardo Dicaprio flying around the world in a private jet to tell us all we need to stop using so much energy. How much energy do you suppose is consumed while producing your insanely high tech cameras? Do you think they&#39;re assembled at the local hippy commune where each lens produced has the expressed consent of mother nature before being polished and inserted into your plastic zoom lens?<br /><br />How about next we highlight Bird Blenders, err Wind Turbines and the thousands of bird corpses littered around them. You go live in the fucking woods with your virtue, there&#39;s nothing wrong with telling people to try and be as clean as humanly possible but just five seconds into the video you&#39;re telling us that sick looking bear is what global warming looks like, implying our evil greedy selves are to blame. Look in the mirror assholes, I have a two bedroom house and a Ford Edge. Also known as using a fraction of the energy it cost you to put this video up on YouTube. <br /><br />Keep it educational and stay out of politics you morons.

The only real solution to save the polar bears is stopping climate Change. <br />If you want to help, reduce your CO2 footprint by Taking the bus instead of driving with your car, reduce the amount of meat you eat, dont waste water.

You&#39;ve been watching earth weather for a blink of an eye and are convinced of global warming. Read agenda 21 and then understand the push.

I want people to see how an animal that big that strong has it&#39;s weakest moments. Understand that everything is living, treat it like an adult, at least give it food. Climate change is real it always will be. But understand that we are killing other animals, and we don&#39;t have to. Please may everyone recognize that we have been on this Earth for less than 100,000 years. That&#39;s 0.8% of Earth&#39;s time. In 0.8% of Earth&#39;s time we managed to kill it. Wow.

That was proven to be false and also, polar bears can swim up to 30 miles. <br /><br />It used to be called global warming, now it is called climate change. Of course the climate is always changing, but to what extent is it because of humans?<br /><br />This video doesn&#39;t prove that the bear is starving because of man made issues. It looks more like the bear has a disease, not just starving. <br /><br />CO2 is not linked to warming. It has been proven false. Volcanoes produce more CO2 each year than all of human inventions combined. Human CO2 production is very minuscule compared to the Earth&#39;s natural making of the gas.<br /><br />Going green is great, but many of the technologies that people want to push are not as efficient as the manufacturers claim, and actually have an adverse effect on the Earth. Stop peddling climate change crap. The cost to make electric cars and wind turbines drastically outweighs the energy savings for the life of the equipment. It takes much less energy to produce regular internal combustion engine vehicles as compared to the special metals in an electric car battery. The amount of metals needed to be produced to make a wind turbine (or energy to produce the metals) are never offset by the energy savings from the turbine itself.

If you actually think this particular bear's condition is somehow caused by "global warming" or that the polar bears are going extinct even though you have the internet available to you, then you're not even worth correcting in a youtube comment.

Using one animal that is dying (disease, starvation, ??) as the poster child for the phony global warming mantra is despicable. The CO2 causation has been proved baseless. Has the climate &quot;changed&quot;? Of course, and it does it over the millenia since Earth was formed.<br /><br />Much research is available that ties the sun to what we are experiencing, particularly the Grand Solar Minimum (GSM). Climate is extremely complex, and it&#39;s disingenuous to use a natural phenomenon as a political weapon. More-so, it&#39;s the penultimate of arrogance to think humans can alter the global climate.

Not a bear, but an actual human. One that was emancipated and clinging on to life. A vulture was waiting for this kid to die and the journalist took the photo. They chased the vulture away and the kid resumed on its way to a feeding center, but other than chasing the animal away there was nothing the journalist could do. he ended up commiting suicide months after because he was haunted by his experiences in the field. its unfortunate, but their hands are often tied... taking a video/photo does help bring light to the situation, she he did more in shooting the video than he would have if he had been able to feed the bear.

Feeding this bear would save its life and end its suffering. As humans we have wildlife rescue operations all over the world that will go great distances and exert super human effort to help animals in need. This is more about "getting the shot" than about true compassion for this animal. Its important to go to the question and answer section of this video to see the truth behind this disgusting attempt to garner support for the lie that is called global warming. This is a natural cycle of the earth that occurs around every fifteen to twenty thousand years. The last one, which ended around 12,800 years ago lasted for three to four thousand years and the ice sheets went all the way down to Florida!!! A few species died from that, we find them in fossil records all the time. Rather than get emotional, get educated. Global warming is natural just as global cooling is. Better be thinking about how to survive the next ice age rather than belly aching about the glaciers melting. We as a species were nearly wiped out by the last ice age, what do you think will happen next time???

The issue is that the natural food source for these bears is disappearing, and we need to do something about that. Filming this is imperative to inspiring people to action. It upsets us enough to remind us that we need to be active about climate change and the issues it causes. The people filming this show us these difficult things so that we will move forward.

It turns out they didn’t just come across the dying bear the day it was filmed: it was spotted at least two days earlier by Paul Nicklen. He must have had a satellite phone with him when he saw the bear but the only call he made was to his film crew — he made no attempt to find a local conservation officer to euthanize the bear, which would have been the right thing to do. The bear’s emaciated, near-death stagger1 was simply too tantilizing to pass up (video needs action: an emaciated dead bear would not been nearly as effective). Mittermeier claims they knew when they filmed the bear that he was sick or injured, but Nicklon presented it as an effect of climate change regardless. Mittermeier now says National Geographic simply “went too far” with their video caption (“This is what climate change looks like“), that she and Nicklan “lost control of the narrative.” you're right not necessarily dumb, gullible.

The human race is the absolute epitome of "over populated" and when we make a judgment on overpopulation for another species we never truly consider the fact that we as a species ourselves are just that.. way overpopulated... because we are humans and better than everything right. To claim that through "research" you have come to the conclusion that Polar Bears are an over populated specie and the type of starvation depicted in this video is naturally expected "because of the over population of said specie" and yet not to take into consideration what an over populated planted full of humans can do to the climate/environment is absolutely absurd and a juvenile way to shun and sweep under the rug your own guilt in participating in the decline of any species in the way of a good comfortable living that and upstanding human Citizen of Metropolis is trying to enjoy.

Realizes, it never says this is global warnings fault. It says this is what it looks like. Sure, this polar bear might not be starving because of global warming, but if global warming continues (and as the video says, drives their main good source away) starving polar bears going through trash could become a more common site. I have no clue of global warming has drawn them to this yet, but it could and this is what it would look like. Sad.

The bottleneck effect causes this when a population suddenly decreases in size due to destruction of habitats. With a small population, there is little genetic variation and fewer mutations developed to prevent sickness. So either way we caused this.

Natural selection is within one species. Also survival of the fittest isn't scientifically validated. I.e. There's no argument when saying other animals will survive over others due to natural selection because that isn't quantifiable across species (or is too-blatantly-obvious to tell which will survive in certain climates). Don't get the two confused.	UCjLkLS8bU46M01voBpsgF8A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjLkLS8bU46M01voBpsgF8A	1	Ugyq9xsn4y4HSPBvhdl4AaABAg	Anthony

You're forgetting the crucial context that those changes or adaptations occur over generations. Not a season or a few years. That's what people forget when they sling that term around so often. A polar bear doesn't know that it needs to adapt because it isn't on that intelligence level. What we see here is it's primitive scavenging instincts kick in. This is not natural selection.

Has anyone else looked at this guy's profile pic?? 2. *Climate change is fake* Idiot Maybe if we did a little experiment like planting lots and lots of trees (and yes that is a real thing... started by a German boy, he wants to plant 1 billion trees globally) then perhaps you could finally see the difference that has been made. Yes, there *is* a difference. The first goal of that big tree experiment I was just talking about was 1 million trees (or something like that). It was proven that there was quite a big difference after that goal had been achieved. 3. I don't know whether to like or dislike this guy's comment. 4. Oh, yeah, and if we keep cutting down trees at this rate, there will be no more trees in approximately 300 years. Kiss those dreams of going to Pluto and talking animals goodbye, because we're all going to die in about 100-300 years. We'll just be another species to be extinct. We'll be up in Heaven along with many other extinct animals. Truth is, they'll be the ones laughing at US. "EXTINCT: Golden toad (Bufo periglenes). Along with the Monteverde harlequin frog (Atelopus varius), also of Central America, the golden toad is among the very small number of species whose recent extinction has been attributed with medium confidence to climate change, according to Scholes and Pörtner. Last seen in 1989, the golden frog lived in mountaintop cloud forests that have disappeared due to drought and other climatic changes. Other confounding factors are involved, such as the deadly chytrid fungus, which has killed off many amphibians worldwide. (See: 'Photos: Ten Most Wanted 'Extinct' Amphibians.')" That passage was from the National Geographic website. "More than 700 species facing extinction are being hit by climate change" This was a headline for an article at http://www.independent.co.uk. It says there, in the subtitle, "Humans’ closest relatives, the primates, are among those worst affected because their tropical habitats have had a stable climate for thousands of years"	UCKB2aSwrpdRZOes-8dB3WDg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKB2aSwrpdRZOes-8dB3WDg	1	UgxO67QOMZGsg6W-mzV4AaABAg	Jack Caldwell

However, go farther north and listen to the Inuit explanation of what is happening; the polar bear population is booming in other areas. Ice is decreasing in some areas, yet greatly increasing in others. The earth goes through many cycles of change, life adapts. However, humans are dead set on attempting to control and manipulate, make it about politics and capitalize revenue rather than seek truth and understand.

Whether it’s a photo of a seahorse holding a q-tip in the ocean or this polar bear withering away bc the ice it needs to survive is melting, these hard truths come at a time when people need to wake up. Use your dollar and voice to pressure corporations to invest in sustainable practices. I want to be part of the solution, don’t you?

I have seen with my own eyes the effects of climate change on this world, and how our leaders do nothing to stop it. Have you been snorkeling in Hawaii recently? Or perhaps on the island of Koh Tao in Thailand? If you have then you would know our oceans are dying as well, and by the ocean, I mean the corals. When corals die, everything goes. Whatever you think about this bear, climate change is real. Instead of posting an ignorant comment, maybe go research what is happening to the world you live on.

Basically, without immigration, the U.S. population might not grow at all, and may even decline.<br /><br />I also have seen statistics, that many other nations around the world, such as Somalia, have birth rates 5 times higher than the U.S. and their populations are exploding.<br /><br />Thus, if you believe in global warming, and you want an actual solution, then continue to pursue conservation activities in the U.S. and let the population in the U.S. decline.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the remainder of the world, the other 95% of it, will continue to have explosive population growth and will continue to pollute the air, land and sea.<br /><br />So, unfortunately, this is not a problem the U.S. can fix, and sadly to say, the majority of the world could care less about animals and the planet.

This bear does not have any obvious signs of being elderly or having a disease. While I don&#39;t know all the facts about this single polar bear, neither do you and the truth is that yes polar bears ARE THREATENED by loss of habitat. Even if this single instance was set up, there are others living in NEARLY IDENTICAL situations. This is not just some conspiracy.

Winter? Or maybe summertime thats why there is no snow/ice? <br /><br />While climate change could be blamed, there are so many other factors as well.<br /><br />Don&#39;t let the media control your actions, get sucked into their agenda or get you to donate to line their pockets.

No one's going to perform an autopsy on a wild animal some photographer saw in the wild. FYI the photographer is also a biologist, he is way more qualified than most people to guess the condition of this animal. They made educated guesses on the condition of the bear that are quite logical, that take in historical weather data of the area and general knowledge that many polar bears in the area are a lot thinner than they used to be. From '84 to 2009, polar bears have generally lost 10% of their body fat and have had 30 days less to hunt seal. Imagine what those stats would be now in 2017!

The video shows a very old polar bear clearly on his (yes, I assumed his gender) last leg and is obviously slowed down. Change the playback speed to 1.5, his fur actually flows at a much realistic speed. This polar bear is very old and about to die, nothing to do with glabal warming.

But in the end no one do’s anything but you can help out as well simple things make big changes start by calling your local mayor and demanding to stop the use of plastic bags in store, to place more cycling bins for communities, it might be crazy to think how plastic bags means anything but most fish are dying because the eat these toxic bags which leads to less seals for the polar bears and the creation of plastic bags also creates CO2 which is creating more house gas in the environment	UCDqs0qC-vIHIBL5dL4yUfkw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDqs0qC-vIHIBL5dL4yUfkw	0

I think this video is a bit disingenuous. The ice is melting, but there are annual fluctuations which are not related to the rise in greenhouse gases. <br /><br />And to be blunt, animals starve all the time. It&#39;s a part of nature. If a bear is too old, too injured or just too unfortunate to find food, it will sadly perish.	UCMRBz9o9ujjFlU-pz88q9DA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMRBz9o9ujjFlU-pz88q9DA	0

Carbon Dioxide and other Green House gases absorbs Infrared Light reflected from Earth's surface, when it could go out to space instead. Carbon Dioxide is one of the weaker Green House gases but it's large in number. And that number has almost doubled. This obviously means that more light is absorbed by the air.

As I said that this is the gravity, gravity pulls, and so, that object either is hurled away from the gravitational pull, or completely falls into it. We are being PULLED by this star called the Sun, and if you didn't already know, stars are VERY dense. Density in objects often make their pull stronger. Now add up the math. Earth may be partially warming up by humans, but don't forget the possibility of us being pulled CLOSER to the sun, thus making us WARMER. Learned something? This is why climate change exists. -H	UCaSqOUZSKQLJhPkSI48IilA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaSqOUZSKQLJhPkSI48IilA	1	Ugycr6WO1moq705SIVl4AaABAg	Joseph Li

Therefore human emissions upset the natural balance, rising CO2 to levels not seen in at least 800,000 years. In fact, human emit 26 gigatonnes of CO2 per year while CO2 in the atmosphere is rising by only 15 gigatonnes per year - much of human CO2 emissions is being absorbed by natural sinks.

UgzYNciG8IiMcEfq0kN4AaABAg	0	0	2017-12-12 02:04:43	Arber	Here are the facts, climate change is fact and ALL scientists agree its real, ever since the little ice age ended(1700s) temperatures have been rising. Green house gasses and our carbon monoxide release as humans have got significantly up since the industrial revolution.This is not this the hottest period in human recordable time, the hottest period was back during the medical warming period, and after that temperatures started lowering until the little ice age. Fact humans have had a major impact in the global warming but we don&#39;t know if this is affected by the earth warming itself.<br /><br />Theories, humans have caused all this warming. Humans have caused no significant enough impact in which the earth is reaching a breaking point. The earth will be destroyed and another theory is the earth will be fine.<br /><br />Conclusion, global warming is occurring due to both the earth itself and our massive release in green house gasses, we don&#39;t know how much of an impact we&#39;ve had to the point where we have plunged this earth to a warming point, the earth is getting hotter overall but there is no clear signs of whether we have completely caused this or its a huge coincidence.<br /><br />My view, I believe we are partly to blame for the speed in which global warming is happening but I think labeling this event as Catastrophic is excessive. We should overall limit our green house gasses production but limit it in our own time because there are bigger issues happening very soon and looking at the graphs we have had a hand in this natural warming and we should look to go clean. But wasting all our resources, time and energy to do it now putting it first is not good.	UCdhcyk_FKQOebxUotl5kEmQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdhcyk_FKQOebxUotl5kEmQ	0

For example, you can show them a video of a starving polar bear and make the person feel heartbroken at such a sight. Even though that video does not necessarily validate the claim that climate change is catastrophic (because you would need to show many videos like this, not just one), the person will still be won over because they used their emotions to validate a claim, not logic. If one used critical thinking to judge whether or not this video is truly evidence for the claim, they may ask, “Could this have happened without climate change? Is it impossible for a polar bear to starve in a scenario without climate change? Do animals starve only because of climate change and nothing else?”	UCi5iNit4BqNNuOuQrs5-ZDg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi5iNit4BqNNuOuQrs5-ZDg	0

They might become dependent on human interaction?? A couple of feedings to ward off starvation and the whole biological evolution of an animals instincts go out the door!! Give me a break. What if we stopped feeding humans who were starving too? Are they at risk for becoming dependent on others too! How about we just start treating ALL life as valuable and equal.

I think of the past, i get anxiety and when i see the bear blinking closing his eyes i see that he gave up and quit. But maybe he was at peace with himself at that point. When my grandmother was dying she couldnt talk and i wish i could talk to her sincerely. This also makes me think about how society is so greedy and selfish. Being selfish isnt bad but gaining at the expense of others is horrible. When homeless peope have homes then i will know that greed doesnt exist. The music is so sad. I wish i was there to help the bear. Giving away my own arm or life would take a ton of courage but i would definitely consider doing it.

By the way, polar bears evolved from brown bears to adapt to the cold. If natural climate change "created " them, then it can take them out as well. Remember that 99% of all species that ever walked the earth are now extinct.

People will come together in a way we don&#39;t have a chance to anywhere else. Lets talk about it as its happening, starts to show the power of comig together. We&#39;ll probably decide to help the animal effected by global warming. If we dont start doing something how will we see that were are doing something about the climate, waiting for jobs to be created isnt reliable enough, meanwhile this will keep happening	UCssfl9vt-qWP8-V1tBn00ZQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCssfl9vt-qWP8-V1tBn00ZQ	0

And the final conclusion that it has only a few hours to live ... how did I you come to that random conclusion? Animals do die of natural causes just an FYI ... humans are not always to blame. Spotting a sick emancipated bear from afar on a single afternoon is no basis on which to make the conclusions Nat Geo has made.

No offense but what proof is there this is caused by inability to feed on seal and not one of the dozens of other reasons. One bear is not proof or connection to climate change. I am not doubting climate change just questioning the science behind this particular connection.	UCPmRk4gNnOXiI-27aYoA92g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPmRk4gNnOXiI-27aYoA92g	0

As the ice recedes, so does the availability of seals. This video may just show one example, but is it possible that this also happens to many other polar bears? Yes.

It is true that polar bear populations are increasing but that is because of legal protections put in place in the 70s, when hunting drove the population extremely low.

Look at the greater picture global warming is destroing this world and we are responsible for this. Maybe this bear would have lifed after they fed him but next year there are more bears starving. <br />And the dull arguments against really doing somthing against global warming are empowered by underming the credit of real scientific reserch. When a long term study can be shruged away because someone just thinks differently about the topic somthing is wrong and this starving polarbear is just one little consequence of all that stupidity. There are more said pictures and stories to come and we can not feed all bears! We have to change our behaving fundamentally to make a difference not temporarly fixing small problems.

The difference is in that situation with the penguin its nature, but in the situation here with the dying polar bear, it's not because of nature. It's human's fault causing climate change, damaging nature. So we dont help the penguin because that's nature, but we should help the dying polar bear because it is not natural. It is our fault.

Let him feed the bear for a few days, let it recover its health, and then allow it to hunt for its own food. Really what's the matter with that? After all, it's just one bear. I say again, one bear. Not even one family of bears. One single act of kindness can help. How does feeding one dying bear affects the ecosystem? It's a life and death situation here, are we really talking about ecosystem now? A polar bear dying in front of you, of which you can save its life, and you'd rather imagine the whole picture and not what's in front of you. Is this because it is an animal and it should hunt it's own food regardless if he's sick or not? This polar bear is incapable to hunt its own food, and it is alone with no companion. It NEEDS others' help. And I tell you what, we humans are animals too -- we are mammals. We are not different than them, we just have better brains and are more capable. So let's say you see a person dying because of starvation, struggling looking for food. Are you gonna leave that person to die? No right? Why, simply because he's 'human'? You see -- you should treat both the polar bear and the dying person the same way, because we are both animals, and both of them are in dire situation in NEED of OTHERS' help. You'd rather see the polar bear die, but not a person die in front of your eyes. I don't see how that makes sense. We're both living things. We're both living in this world. Every single life matter in this world.	UCBwb730ZxmlOC48Qd853VgQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBwb730ZxmlOC48Qd853VgQ	1	Ugxmu9ePVLeLMqkKn754AaABAg	Foxtrot 29

And you are talking as if there aren't animals being saved all around the globe (specially endangered animals) and are bring fed, protected and treated in special facilities designed for that before eventually being released into a suitable habitat, it's not unheard of.

They didn’t have the food supply to sustain him or the means to euthanize him. Legal, cultural and personal reasons also played a factor. The bear was also clearly dying, past the point of recovery. Had probably died within hours or days of the video. At least that’s what was said. They’re photographers, they carry cameras not medical supplies, pounds of meat, rifles.

Secondly, do you guys think that animals didn't die before "global warming"? Wouldn't the population of polar bears be in the tens of millions when "global warming" happened because they never starved or got sick or got injured or old?

A smaller bear population could allow their main food sources a chance to repopulate and as long as their habitat doesn't disappear the bear population should then grow.

Without access to its primary food source the only thing they'd be doing is prolonging its suffering. Even if they where to go through the the trouble of rehabilitation they would still be sending it back into a shrinking habitat where food just continues to become scarce.

The ultimate goal would be to change the polar bears primary food source thus giving the species a better chance of survival with minimal human intervention) ultimately we likely should force evolution for failing species....lets have a momment of clarity. We did this. Our species did this. We are resposible for this. And nobody is going to pop out of the sky and fix it for us. Its about time we grew a set and fix our mistakes..

However, my gut tells me there&#39;s more to what&#39;s going on with this bear in particular than just starvation. Something is wrong physically be it illness or possible infection. <br />Also, polar bears aren&#39;t that picky when it comes to food -- they are one of the only animals that actively hunts humans for food. They can and will eat any kind of meat and if they&#39;re in an area where there&#39;s other animals they will eat them. They do not just survive on seals; those are a primary food source in the winter when there is ice they can travel on. <br />In summer they are always struggling to find enough food since there&#39;s not as much larger animals to eat. <br />They are, however, intelligent and resourceful (like most bears) and can survive through ingenuity and their natural curiosity helps in that as well. <br /><br />Again, I can appreciate the sentiment of awareness for our human impact on the environment(s) of the planet -- but this, there&#39;s more to this than meets the eye. Something about this bear just tells me it is ill and not just starved.&quot;<br /><br />To me this is more a play on people&#39;s emotions which yeah, can have an impact but it&#39;s only creates anger toward humans. All you have to do is read 90% of the comments here and you&#39;ll see most people aren&#39;t being reasonable toward people. <br />&quot;HUMAN BEINGS ARE SO AWFUL! LOOK WHAT WE&#39;RE DOING TO OUR PLANET!&quot; -- Meanwhile, there&#39;s an immeasurable amount of good and innovation going on to HELP the environments that our forebears depleted. You&#39;d of been a bit better off showing this but then showing the healthy populous of bears which are successful in their environment despite their hardships. <br />It&#39;s always the same story when &#39;awareness&#39; is posted, it has to be SHOCKING or heart-wrenching or people assume we&#39;re too stupid of ignorant to not feel for these animals. The general populous aren&#39;t idiots and we&#39;re not adverse to the realisation that changes are happening. Most of us know this but we&#39;re also open to the realisation that there&#39;s more to this than meets the eye. There&#39;s more to what&#39;s going on with our Earth and it&#39;s flora and fauna than meets the eye. I for one won&#39;t just sit back and accept that humans are the only problem this planet is facing and why all of this is happening. It is just illogical given historical statistics and values.<br />Still, this is heartbreaking but there&#39;s more to this than just a &#39;starving polar bear&#39; =/ This animal was obviously sick and ill for a long time previous to this discovery. You can see it in the movement and carriage of the body.	UCn7-_3wGEGayy0JpFJsioRQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn7-_3wGEGayy0JpFJsioRQ	0

I also have no doubt in my mind that half the people that watched this video haven't don't more than 5 minutes of research on climate change if that. Way to many people these days not doing their research and then taking a strong position on an issue.

Just because the polar bear can inflict pain and suffering death onto a baby seal doesnt mean we can "not care" (by the way what a terrible attitude you have there mate) when a polar bear is starving. Lets say the polar bear was an invasive species we still shouldn't want it to starve to death unless YOU ARE WILLING TO STARVE TO DEATH!

[...] But we also share far too much in common pretend that we are some form of life that transcends animal status.” Both comments are one hour apart and from the exact same account. Do you share an account with somebody else, like a sibling that disagrees or are you simply correcting yourself? Also sorry if more than one message sends, YouTube’s acting weird on my end.

The problem is giant trawlers are overfishing and sending the fish to Asia. ... if you look at the global warming during the Cambrian period, the ocean was full of life. The carbon dioxide level was 15 times higher than now and the oceans were super warm. When the earth cooled, the life died. Then the life turned into oil used is in plastic,shoes, fabric, helmets, gas, shampoo, food, medicine, cloth, glasses, phones, tv, roads, computers, cars, buses, planes, trains, diesel, lights, roofs, flooring, carpet, boats, ships, pillows, sofas, love seats, chairs	UCC2XYqg8NiYQ0_Q_wvdjLiw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC2XYqg8NiYQ0_Q_wvdjLiw	1	UgxX1t47yufMd5pDJ5N4AaABAg	National Geographic

It's emotional manipulation. You can go to any hospital in the USA and see human beings in such a miserable state. None of it is due to climate change. And it's very likely this isn't either.

For starters it is difficult to safely feed hungry polar bears, as they are very large predators. The other concern is that no one wants polar bears dependent upon human food for their survival. This is because dependent animals can lose the ability to feed for themselves, thus endangering them in the long term, while also increasing the likelihood of them wandering into human habitation and killing humans.

They are trying to make emotional reactions without any merit. This is on polar bear dying out of 25 thousand, and there is not even a definitive reason as to why it died. Internal injuries causing it to not be able to hunt? Illness? Drop in immediate prey availability? We get nothing. This could be, and most likely is a normal animal death due to natural wilderness conditions, but no, they give you sad sob music and a dying animal to make you want to believe global warming is imminent. Remember when the ice caps melted in 2012? Me either. The polar bear population is doing fine and so is the seal population. This is pure emotional manipulation, and as I have already said propaganda. We aren't disliking the fact that a dying animal is sad. We are disliking the manipulation by the national geographic.

When something revolves a very dense object, say the moon around earth, or the earth around our sun, it is being pulled towards that gravity, that is what we call an orbit. As I said that this is the gravity, gravity pulls, and so, that object either is hurled away from the gravitational pull, or completely falls into it. We are being PULLED by this star called the Sun, and if you didn't already know, stars are VERY dense. Density in objects often make their pull stronger. Now add up the math. Earth may be partially warming up by humans, but don't forget the possibility of us being pulled CLOSER to the sun, thus making us WARMER. Learned something? This is why climate change exists. -H	UCaSqOUZSKQLJhPkSI48IilA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaSqOUZSKQLJhPkSI48IilA	1	UgxPBGZBNr3oO8EAWEV4AaABAg	Tazzamania

What I mean is I hope they took him to a sanctuary and then at the end of the video talked about ways that you personally could help to prevent these incidents. Specifically speaking, how to lower your ecological footprint with small things such as recycling, buying local foods, walking/biking or taking public transportation instead of driving a car, buying smaller cars instead of trucks or SUVs, eating less meat, and supporting environmental protection groups. Just feeding him won’t change anything, action and education will.	UCBuHNbYzjIBhzb9g6GDoRkw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBuHNbYzjIBhzb9g6GDoRkw	0

During the last ten years we’ve had record breaking temperatures every summer. Since the 1880’s the average temperature has increased by one degree. That may not seem like much but only if you ignore that most organisms don’t do well with change. A 1-2 degree difference is enough to throw entire ecosystems out of order. I also want to mention that while Earth’s climate is cyclical, we were supposed to enter a cooling phase. That didn’t happen and current trends suggest that won’t happen.

I agree that there's a possibility of this not being caused by climate change but it's very low. And btw brown bears and polar bears existed at the same time but they mated with eachother increasing the population when the ice sheets started melting.

If you add everything up it seems pretty clear to me that the polar bear couldn't find any food for months due to ice sheets melting then on it's last days going into human territory due to starvation and then end up dying because it couldn't find any food and none of the humans were allowed to feed the polar bear. It's always good to question videos like these but all the facts points to the polar bear starving due to climate change and no other evidence of rabies other than some foaming.

Okay but it wasn't chewing at nothing it was chewing at a scrap of food and bears rarely rarely get rabies especially polar bears. While it is difficult to point at a single bear and say it's dying of climate change, this video does show what's actually happening to this endangered species due to habitat loss.

Its part of the whole failing organs thing. This has all the hallmarks of an animal forced from its habitat and starving. He was searching for food to keep going. As another user said, rabies can be exacerbated by climate change: the more these animals wander from their ice the more likely they will hunt for smaller prey and come in contact with diseased raccoons, foxes, wolves, ect. Its a no win situation.	UC0SrPeFDOfsZoxfZT9Dn6EQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0SrPeFDOfsZoxfZT9Dn6EQ	1	UgyuMLi9K_zTxmX8yRh4AaABAg	Lucas' Old Channel

Sometimes the animal may just be very drooly. It sounds weird but this is possibility, many different types of animals may sometimes get foamy spit on the outside of their mouths.

Temperature and humidity influence the rate of survival and reproduction of pathogens, such as the rabies virus. The prevalence of infectious viruses is growing as an exponential rate in arctic environments and this coincides directly with the increase in global temperatures. Many animals who are weak as it is, like this polar bear, become exposed to such pathogens which will likely kill them.

A polar bear wouldn't get that close to humans far away from the ice unless there was no ice and it couldn't find any food for months.

If you feed a bear it will associate humans with food and that could end deadly for the next person encountering it. Also: Grow up. They did exactly what reporters are supposed to do. If YOU feel so strongly about a wild animal suffering go devote your life to saving the environment. Don't sit on your couch and dare to insult people who venture out there doing important things to at least try and imprrove things...even if that didn't mean they could save this particular specimen.

Did you even wonder why it was on land in the first place? the environment it was native to, collapsed, which caused it to search for another habitat for days on end, hence finding land, and having to adapt there instead. Polar bears are not natural hunters on land, and therefore tend to die of starvation when not in their natural habitat. Do some research, you have the internet in front of you.

The reality is, animals die primarily in three ways. 1. Starve to death because there physical ailments prohibit them. 2. Freeze to death 3. Eaten alive Animals don't live forever. They don't die happily in their sleep with their family. One of the main reasons Polar Bears starve is because the population has grown, yes grown, too much in the past 40 years. So if you really want healthy polar bears, we should go shoot the old and sick. More food for the healthy and young and a quick death for the others. Just my 2 cents.

If the “adorable baby seals” don’t get eaten, as sad as it is, the fish will die, and there will be no food for other animals important to the ecosystem, so from polar bears to bees, as annoying or terrible as you think they are, they all contribute to the circle of life, and imagine nature without animals.

The amount of gaz energie we produce is higher than what the earth used to produce during these cycle peeks. The rising will keep going on and won't stop tomorow. Right now, that natural cycle your talking about is becoming negligible.

Usually rabies. ... in the arctic there is a lot of rabies but scientists won't say it's rabies without an autopsy. And there are not many scientists willing to risk their lives by performing an autopsy on a dead polar bear full of rabies viruses.

I doubt it. If you have, you would have seen the paws larger then your dinner plates that can crush the life out of you in a single swipe. These are not cute cuddly bears that ice skate around and drink coke. They are vicious predators that will not think twice about eating you alive, then washing you down with a coke. 😂 When was the last rime you saw a bunny, aka "any animal is dangerous" that could do that?

First, human dietary needs are much different from that of a polar bear, and human food could make the bear more sick. Second, feeding animals can lead the creature to associate humans with food, and it will actively seek them in order to get what it wants. This often leads to aggressive behavior on the animal's part as it becomes desperate to eat, and the animal may attack somebody (you probably know how that will end with a polar bear attacking a person). Many people have the first response to kill an aggressive animal in self defense, ultimately leaving the bear as dead as it would have been by starving. Although I do suppose death by a bullet would be more merciful than starvation, but I digress. In any case, no wild animal should be fed. It's sad, but better off for both sides. In order to truly keep these bears alive, people need to realize the dangers we pose on the environment and take quick action. Sorry for the long paragraph!

There are thousands of people starving and dying from drought because of global warming. Farmers in countries are committing suicide because they can't raise crops. So it's not just polar bears.

The polar bear population is thriving and has roughly tripled. This is another common piece of anecdotal propaganda released by NATGEO. They recorded a sick bear to push a narrative about climate change, and have since issued a weak apology. There are so many polar bears (and fat ones) that they are becoming a threat to natives in Nunavut.

I know that life is life and everything has a beginning and an end but there comes a point in time where if enough people lend a helping hand we can make everything between a little more bearable.

Meat has become so common and cheap (in "developed" countries) it's in most people's daily diet. However, this wasn't the case long ago as far as I know. Meat is a delicacy, and should be eaten in balance. Another factor is our increasing population. In which case we, as a species, may simply have to eat less meat than our ancestors. We can't just keep growing and attempt to sustain our meat production forever as easily as our crop production.

Animal agriculture is massively inefficient. A plant based diet takes up far less land, consumes far less resources and produces far less GHG. Is it really that complicated? For example, dairy cows eat around 45kg of food every day, or 100,000-150,000kcal, but only produce around 30L of milk, or 18,000 calories. And no, farming the feed isn't meaningfully more efficient in space than farming a typical mixture of vegetables etc for a healthy human diet. Especially with vertical farming, hydroponics etc.	UComCUw7tVMvcWbaON_7ugdQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UComCUw7tVMvcWbaON_7ugdQ	1	UgweTY76dwzr2wxsTxN4AaABAg	Vegan Tony

Eat locally-produced and organic food 3. Cut on meats and animal products 4. Support clean energy resource like solar 5. Compost your food waste 6. Be a responsible consumer and know where your products come from Eat locally-produced and organic food It has been estimated that 13% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions result from the production and transport of food. Transporting food requires petroleum-based fuels, and many fertilizers are also fossil fuel-based. Reuse and recycle It has been estimated that 29% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions result from the “provision of goods,” which means the extraction of resources, manufacturing, transport, and final disposal of “goods” which include consumer products and packaging, building components, and passenger vehicles, but excluding food. Cut the beef and dairy It takes a lot of resources to raise cows, and it’s especially bad if you buy beef from somewhere like Brazil, where it was grazed on land that used to be tropical forest but was cleared for agricultural use. Deforestation is a top contributor to carbon emissions and thus climate change.	UCpMxN3Lxwm7E5TQgRQ3e_Fg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpMxN3Lxwm7E5TQgRQ3e_Fg	1	Ugy-MrI2Cwt4PhpKnkF4AaABAg	Dapperr
