They mention how our current energy sources are harmful to our planet but also mention how we’ve constructed our society off of fossil fuel burning and its almost impossible to cut this as an energy source without causing severe damage to our economy and power supply. Dealing with climate change is like stopping a car on an icy road. We can’t slam the breaks and wipe ff burning off the earth, we have to ease into the stop, introduce cleaner ways to burn fossil fuels along with finding efficient renewable alternatives to shift into over time. Its good to remember the world will change but it won’t be the end if we head in the right direction.	UCiWIGbuoM6nWO4Nt_qnEOIQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiWIGbuoM6nWO4Nt_qnEOIQ	0

It warms up for awhile and then cools down for a bit and repeats. It’s a self regulating system. We could of never polluted the atmosphere and since be dealing with climate change in the year 3000. Are we accelerating the process? Probably, but not as fast as they claim we are. Should we back off the pollution? Of course. But all we are is delaying the inevitable. In truth what we should be doing instead manipulating nature, is doing what humans do best and what allowed us to stand at the top of the food chain: adapt.

Trees sequester carbon from the atmosphere, but in the Amazon trees are being cut down so rapidly which releases their carbon stores along with ruining the soil due to a lack of biomass decaying on the ground. Climate change means forests are dryer which causes more forests to disappear which in turn heats up the planet. These are positive feedback loops that will grow exponentially without humans stopping what we are doing. The coral reefs dying is a positive feedback loop. The Taiga being sold off for tar sands creates a positive feedback loop. Acid rain and acidic oceans are a positive feedback loop. Yes climate change occurs naturally, but not to this extent and damage.	UCfJ6vM_4dF8AB4nySk19-DQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfJ6vM_4dF8AB4nySk19-DQ	1	UgyIdOvZQen_7c9t_L54AaABAg	CamaroAmx

I don’t expected massive companies and countries to do anything to seriously change the situation. They might make small efforts, but when the going gets tough all everyone cares about are short term problems. Very few people actually care about how ruined they’ll leave the Earth for the next generations, when huge sacrifices are on the line. Companies care even less when the alternative is sacrificing a million billion dollars. There are still politicians, business owners, and everyday people out right denying that climate change isn’t real. I want to show this video to people in gridlock arguing over whatever silly thing trump said on Twitter today. Humanity as a whole is such a conceited species. We endanger and eradicate (make extinct) entire species. We cut down forests and destroy habitats around us. We ruin the Earth we leave on and waste so much. All so we can keep some conveniences or because we want to eat X food or Y whatever. We care more when some wackado kills 5 people (out of 7 billion) than when WE make multiple species extinct and cause natural disaster. And a lot of this we could have avoided (or at least lessened) if our country had a little foresight and companies weren’t as greedy. Our nation could have chosen to build less roads and make cars less of a necessity and focused more on public transportation (less land/forests taken away for roads and less cars on the road). Now insurance, dealerships, and manufacturers will never let that happen. We could have kept glass reusable bottles over plastic. I don’t know how expensive it could be, but the government could start providing or somehow making clean reusable energy available and affordable to more Americans so we don’t feel as forced to use our current electricity. The saddest thing is though that, we don’t care at all. This issue hardly ever makes media coverage and when it does it’s paid little attention to. Americans care more about abortion laws, gun arguments, and what their fave celebrity is eating for brunch, then they do the fact that we’re ruining the Earth and at this point it’s not “how do we stop it”, “it’s how do we soften the blow”. I am genuinely scared and feel so much hatred. When I was younger I heard time and time again how adults were preparing the world to give to us or how they were doing everything to make it safer for us or how they wanted nothing more than the best for us. Here I stand knowing we’re inheriting the keys to a dying world that they couldn’t stop to save it over losing some money. I honestly feel that at this point if you are born into this world you just lost.	UCYT4QrYqHL6PFki-7MiNqEw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYT4QrYqHL6PFki-7MiNqEw	0

In the big climate change events like the ones in the Paleogene were slower, life had time to evolve. These events happened over spans of hundreds to thousands of years but in the last 20 years we have been ruining our environment to quick for many species to adapt. It isn't like the new environment suddenly appears and everything is racing to adapt, no the climate slowly heats and the members of those species who survive will evolve through natural selection into a species that can tolerate the new climate. If you can't you die. But with the speedy climate change, our pollution, habitat destroyed, animal species still at the very brink for our past efforts, wildfires, invasive species, and melting icecaps means natural selection will likely not matter because most keystone species are majorly screwed leading to ecological collapse.

I watch them throw plastic bottles and aluminum cans into a trash can that literally sits beside a recycling bin. I almost never drink soda and drink water from the fountain so I make much less in the way of recyclables but I do recycle everything I can. When I ask them why they don’t recycle they said that it doesn’t matter. They also believe global warming is fake. I’m trying to save the planet for them and they are too naive and too arrogant to even try to see that they could be wrong.

Co2 has one Hydrogen and 2 Oxygen atoms in the molecule, and to keep these atoms from separating we need electrical bonds, so Co2 has 2 bonds worth of energy stored in the molecule, as for Ch4 (methane), we have 1 carbon atom and 4 hydrogen atoms and tere are 4 bonds to keep the molecule together. so about 4% of the atmosphere is made up of Ch4 which means a cows farts are also contrubuting to cimae change. a bigger more exterme example is in volcanoes which release more Ch4 into the atmosphere then the entire human race worth of Co2 could ever make in a very long time. this means that we are small fry compared to the &quot;damage&quot; of volcanoes and cow farts! Look i might be crazy but im just trying to think about this logically and scientifically, yes adam and his research team are right about specific humans causing the plastic damage in the seas, the many killings of animals and deaths of trees and such. i just wanted to point out that Global warming is pretty much a normal thing to happen on literally every planet in the universe, i mean how did the ice age happen 1500 years ago because there was a lack of energy and energy is heat, so everything just cooled down alot. you can almost think of the waves of happiness and sadness a human experiences in thier lifetime as the same thing as of planet earths hot and cold waves every 1000 years. In conclusion no matter what we do, changes to the earth are going to happen whether we like it or not even if it means the end of humanity. so yeah hope you enjoyed reading this...bye	UCKelCAeteUp195soCNRd3fQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKelCAeteUp195soCNRd3fQ	0

Only problem is that their &quot;normalization&quot; always results in a temperature going up never down. Proper normalization is done to take care of data that was bad such as when someone builds an asphalt parking lot near a weather station that would increase the temps from normal... But mysteriously enough you can&#39;t find any data where NASA lower the temps only raised them. That is only because of a hidden agenda to support the hoax of global warming. Look at the old Al Gore film on global warming... now go see how many of those cities he said would be underwater are actually under water. He was wrong across the board. That should really be the stake in the heart of global warming.	UCfLduvlUpGRHZ3vTaS2SDGQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfLduvlUpGRHZ3vTaS2SDGQ	0

Newsflash: We&#39;re not.<br /><br />Sure, climate change is happening, pollution is rampant, sea and carbon levels are rising, various species are dying and the planet&#39;s global average temperature is increasing. Regardless of all that, the Earth has been through a LOT worse than us. Super-volcanoes, cosmic radiation, solar flares, ice ages, magnetic reversal of the poles, asteroid impacts... and we think some plastic bags, fossil fuels and a bunch of farting cows is somehow going to &#39;destroy the planet&#39;? <br /><br />THE PLANET IS NOT GOING ANYWHERE ... WE ARE! <br /><br />&quot;We&#39;re saving the planet,&quot; is the ultimate line of nonsensical self-aggrandizement, boasting the self-importance of a insignificant life form, scientifically known as homo-sapiens (aka: humans. aka: us). If it gets bad enough, we humans will simply cease to exist. At the very least - those who survive - will experience a way of life that is drastically different than we know today. And when we are gone, within the next 10,000 years the Earth will have fully cleansed itself, and removed almost all traces that we were even here. The Earth will keep going LONG after we are gone. Long after we have become just another failed dead-end species that once existed and now extinct, the Earth will be here just floating around in the vastness of space, on it&#39;s annual journey around our very average star.<br /><br />This is not a battle to &#39;save the planet.&#39; It is a battle to save our race. Still, humans aren&#39;t going anywhere for at least 50-100 years... so why should you care? You will get to live your life.

Since it's such a small amount, your kidneys usually deal with it with great ease. Most vaccines of today, though, don't even have a single trace of mercury, just tons of chemicals already in your body normally, the weakened virus/disease, and oxegen. Still, vaccines shouldn't be anything to worry about being toxic. There's too much reasearch about vaccines for that to happen.

However the real cause of it is not the large masses and overpopulation as is being drilled in our minds by the criminals themselves but it's the multinational corporations themselves. *They* are the ones who refuse to make their supply chain to not be wasteful, harmful for all living beings, inefficient (resulting in so many useful resources being wasted), etc etc. They also bully small farmers and sustsinable and local home industries but they are actually the key to solving climate change and inefficient supply chain. They waste too much money in superficial things and lies like fancy packages and ads for virtue signalling (without real action). And now they are trying to monetize lab virus pandemic, forcing governments to use remdesivir which has been proven useless in COVID-19 treatments even if it's more expensive than HCQ and vit. C and also the vaccine which they will infuse with mercury and other things which will cause new diseases that they will monetize more. Sick. The fast paced urban life is also used to risen stress and so, health issues of the mass. Then they will monetize it too by selling drugs, prostitutes, Hollywood films and music and more.

HDHZ show temperature chart where we can clearly see that yearly temperature in capital city of my country is rised 2°C in 150 years. If you don't believe to me then you will believe to real scienciests. Scientific evidence for warming of the climate system is unequivocal. The current warming trend is of particular significance because most of it is extremely likely (greater than 95 percent probability) to be the result of human activity since the mid-20th century and proceeding at a rate that is unprecedented over decades to millennia. Earth-orbiting satellites and other technological advances have enabled scientists to see the big picture, collecting many different types of information about our planet and its climate on a global scale. This body of data, collected over many years, reveals the signals of a changing climate. The heat-trapping nature of carbon dioxide and other gases was demonstrated in the mid-19th century. Their ability to affect the transfer of infrared energy through the atmosphere is the scientific basis of many instruments flown by NASA. There is no question that increased levels of greenhouse gases must cause the Earth to warm in response. Ice cores drawn from Greenland, Antarctica and tropical mountain glaciers show that the Earth’s climate responds to changes in greenhouse gas levels. Ancient evidence can also be found in tree rings, ocean sediments, coral reefs and layers of sedimentary rocks. This ancient or paleoclimate evidence reveals that current warming is occurring roughly ten times faster than the average rate of ice-age-recovery warming. The evidence for rapid climate change is compelling: 1) Global Temperature Rise The planet's average surface temperature has risen about 1.62 degrees Fahrenheit (0.9 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide and other human-made emissions into the atmosphere. Most of the warming occurred in the past 35 years, with the five warmest years on record taking place since 2010. Not only was 2016 the warmest year on record, but eight of the 12 months that make up the year — from January through September, with the exception of June — were the warmest on record for those respective months.  2) Warming Oceans The oceans have absorbed much of this increased heat, with the top 700 meters (about 2,300 feet) of ocean showing warming of more than 0.4 degrees Fahrenheit since 1969. 3) Shrinking Ice Sheets The Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have decreased in mass. Data from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment show Greenland lost an average of 286 billion tons of ice per year between 1993 and 2016, while Antarctica lost about 127 billion tons of ice per year during the same time period. The rate of Antarctica ice mass loss has tripled in the last decade. 4) Glacial Retreat Glaciers are retreating almost everywhere around the world — including in the Alps, Himalayas, Andes, Rockies, Alaska and Africa. 5) Decreased Snow Cover Satellite observations reveal that the amount of spring snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere has decreased over the past five decades and that the snow is melting earlier. 6) Sea Level Rise Global sea level rose about 8 inches in the last century. The rate in the last two decades, however, is nearly double that of the last century and is accelerating slightly every year. 7) Declining Arctic Sea Ice Both the extent and thickness of Arctic sea ice has declined rapidly over the last several decades. 8) Extreme Events The number of record high temperature events in the United States has been increasing, while the number of record low temperature events has been decreasing, since 1950. The U.S. has also witnessed increasing numbers of intense rainfall events 9) Ocean Acidification Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the acidity of surface ocean waters has increased by about 30 percent. This increase is the result of humans emitting more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and hence more being absorbed into the oceans. The amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by the upper layer of the oceans is increasing by about 2 billion tons per year. In the 1860s, physicist John Tyndall recognized the Earth's natural greenhouse effect and suggested that slight changes in the atmospheric composition could bring about climatic variations. In 1896, a seminal paper by Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius first predicted that changes in the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could substantially alter the surface temperature through the greenhouse effect. Scientific Consensus Ninety-seven percent of climate scientists agree that climate-warming trends over the past century are extremely likely due to human activities, and most of the leading scientific organizations worldwide have issued public statements endorsing this position.

Also, we didn&#39;t have a bouy system to accurately record temperatures until about 1960-1980, so we&#39;re relying on data that&#39;s from scientists using mercury thermometers - not the most accurate thing on the planet. <br /><br />You might want to look into why the dean of atmospheric sciences at Georgia Tech retired. Spoilers, she said anyone who disagrees with global warming in a scientific manner is blackballed (literally can&#39;t get jobs, publish papers, etc.). Why? Government (especially the Democrat Party) funds the research and wants to use the &quot;we&#39;re destroying the planet&quot; gig to make themselves look like good guys.

You are confusing natural warming and cooling that fluctuates slowly over millennia. Man-caused climate change is caused by the steadily increasing Co2 emissions since the industrial age causing far higher increases in temperature and at much faster rates which is bloody dangerous. Humans can stop this potentially existential threat if people like you start reading the actual science and stop believing the propaganda the corporations are putting out there via alt-right youtubes and memes, and instead demand change.

I think there is some confusion here. Climate cycles were always there. Climate change is typically referring to abnormal changes to the climate that hypothetically wouldn't have happened without human intervention.

Have you heard of Occam's razor? I would argue that humans are the simplest explanation for climate change and not many people have another culprit in mind. Sure it really sucks to feel responsible if we did cause it but that is how the cookie crumbles. It doesn't mean you personally lit a garbage fire and ruined the earth but the human race has, I would say almost obviously, affected climate change for the worse through our activities. The burning of fossil fuels being one of them.	UCsnqcUF3YG34Qer47Pn5CEQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsnqcUF3YG34Qer47Pn5CEQ	1	UgzFU5eEjX4Zeeaq6u94AaABAg	Ethan Kellerman

If I recall, from when I read it, it does say in the Quran: "Behold, thy Lord said to the angels: "I will create a vicegerent on earth." They said: "Wilt Thou place therein one who will make mischief therein and shed blood?- whilst we do celebrate Thy praises and glorify Thy holy (name)?"

So all the flooding, huge wild fires, rise &amp; fall of oceans, rise &amp; fall of global temperatures, increases &amp; decreases of polar ice, super storms, extinctions, growth &amp; recessions of coastal regions, etc, etc, etc that happened before humans were ever on the planet didn&#39;t happen or were some how humans&#39; fault (even though we weren&#39;t on the planet yet) also? Listen...I&#39;m all for not polluting the environment and stopping the destruction of ecosystems. However, you liberals have to stop lying about climate change. BTW, I live in Houston. So I personally know what contributes to the horrible flooding during Harvey and other storms that hit our area. I agree that corruption and over development has caused almost all of our problems here with flooding. Many new communities were built in flood zones that native Houstonians like myself knew about. My dad&#39;s parents bought a home in neighborhood decades ago that used to be a rice field. There was a reason why they grew rice there before a developer built their neighborhood there. My mom&#39;s family, who were native Houstonians, worried them about buying a home there. They didn&#39;t listen, and of course the house flooded many times. That neighborhood has since been torn down. The land reallocated for flood control. With all this said, all the weather today has happened in the past well before humans were ever on the planet. but that doesn&#39;t fit the &quot;green&quot; industries plans to make billions off of hysterical scammed ignorant individuals. In fact most that own and run &quot;green&quot; industries don&#39;t actually follow their own &quot;green&quot; preached policies/practices. Same for most of the &quot;green&quot; politicians. But most in the media and education system (climate scientists) aren&#39;t going to tell you that. They&#39;re all making far too much money off of the scam. They&#39;re going to tell you that natural events (like a volcanic erruptions, wobbl of the Earth&#39;s rotation, changes in the sun&#39;s activity, etc) effect our planet&#39;s climate far more than humans have and can. Again, let me make it very. I&#39;m all for stopping pollution and cutting down of the Amazon and destruction of other ecosystems. However, I am not going to fall for corrupt rich media tycoons and politicians lies about &quot;climate change&quot; (which has been happening since the beginning of time on Earth) so they can make more millions and billions of dollars off of a scam. BTW, those &quot;climate change&quot; scientists are paid through grants, subsidies, and donations given to them by the very same corrupt politicians and corporate big wigs getting richer off of the scam. Why would they ever cut off the money sources for their salaries and &quot;studies&quot;. Same for the corrupt media. They get paid large amounts in advertising for creating hysteria and lying to the public. Especially since the vast majority of the media is owned by just a few multi-millionaires. Even your local stations are owned by huge media corporations. They&#39;re not independent. They operate at the mercy of what ever corrupt media tycoons tell them to do. It&#39;s a huge monopoly that most aren&#39;t talking about because...well...that mean that media and politicians would have to police themselves. Yeah...not happening. Wonder when Bernie Sanders is going to sell off his 3 mansions and give up flying on private jets to follow what he preaches. Same for Al Gore and the other &quot;climate change&quot; alarmists. Hey...do as they say, not as they make millions of dollars off of your ignorance and hysteria. A.O.C. will be a multi-millionaire in no time. She figured out that gravy train real fast. BTW, I can&#39;t stand the corrupt Republicans also. It&#39;s just that the Democrats are more corrupt and dangerous to this country right now. The two party political system is another scam and destructive to America. It lives off of lies, hysteria, hypocrisy, bigotry, hate, and greed. Both political parties are corrupt. Cracks me up that most that hate Trump don&#39;t know a d@mn thing and truth about his actions and policies. Thanks corrupt media and emotionally manipulated voters. BTW, I wish Trump would shut up and don&#39;t agree with all of his policies. However, that doesn&#39;t surprise me because Trump is really not a conservative or liberal overall. That&#39;s why I find it hysterical that people hate him despite not knowing that he has policies that help them and fit their beliefs. They&#39;ve just been told by the &quot;popular kids&quot; not to associate with him. Hate makes people very stupid. Like with &quot;global climate change&quot;. It also makes multi-millionaires &amp; multi-billionaires tons of more money.	UC7_z8bdFJjYg4e5Lz1Dr_yQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7_z8bdFJjYg4e5Lz1Dr_yQ	0

Cows are big contributors to greenhouse gases, because of the amounts of CO2 that they burp up. (Apparently, the rumors of their flatulence have been greatly exaggerated.) Please do not misunderstand me. I'm from Alberta, Canada which has a huge cattle industry. I love steak, barbeque, Korean barbeque, beef jerky, beef sausage, beef consomme soup, beef gravy, poutine, etc. But if I eat beef everyday, I worry that the planet might not be able to absorb all of the greenhouse gases that result, and then my kids will not have much of a planet to live on. I just want my kids to have a sustainable planet, so that they can have kids who also enjoy beef in moderation. You know what? Chicken, turkey, pork, fish, eggs, and hell even tofu are pretty good if done right. And if you hunt, I also recommend deer and moose!

The best way to prevent the world from warming up is to go on a plant based diet. Whether you admit or not. Politicians are getting wayy too much profit from these oil companies and will never change they’re ways. But we can. If the majority of the world to go vegan , we would plant more plants that would create more oxygen, and the majority of factory farms would be gone. The amount of greenhouse gas emissions would plummet. There would be no need to cause anymore deforestation from slaughterhouses and factory farms. It could potentially save the planet. Veganism is also a lot healthier for you and we really shouldn’t kill animals if we don’t have to. Go vegan 🌱💓	UCgqLUMBq6D4aRIchyDrY41w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgqLUMBq6D4aRIchyDrY41w	0

Nuclear power is much safer than fossil fuels and is probably 98% less polluting, yet these dumbasses protesting it wave around two accidents, one caused by a horribly engineered soviet design and the other by one of the strongest earthquakes in history, while ignoring the pollution and thousands of smaller, yet cumulatively far more deadly accidents in fossil fuel power production. Then they trumpet solar power and renewable energy, which is great where it’s available at reasonable cost but the technology is not yet cost effective to provide these renewable power sources everywhere. <br /><br />December 10, 2018 12:10 am	UC0Li9k46iDx8rwIKth1fXOQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0Li9k46iDx8rwIKth1fXOQ	0

Why not show how those hydrocarbons got into the earth. The conditions on earth before those hydrocarbons got there. The reason they weren&#39;t eaten by bacteria initially (that bacteria hadn&#39;t evolved yet). The long term levels of atmospheric CO2. The relationship between CO2 and the growth rate of C3 photosynthetic organisms. The development of C4 and CAM photosynthetic organisms in response to an atmosphere gradually approaching the point where C3 organisms couldn&#39;t even grow.<br /><br />&quot;We&#39;re in for a lot worse&quot;<br /><br />It&#39;s also interesting how the scientist immediately starts up with the &quot;massive&quot; &quot;could&quot; and other unscientific terms. Ocean levels rose 330 feet in the last 20,000 years. 8 inches of sea level change isn&#39;t &quot;massive.&quot; It&#39;s something to worry about and adapt to.

CO2 accounts for 0.045% of the air and it could rise as high as 0.05 or 0.09. Many gullible people are alive today. Did you know that Vikings were growing vegetables in Greenland where now all exists is Ice!? What I can guarantee is that humans are really good at making you believe what they want you to believe. And when they say all scientists agree that .... this is 100% never the case. Therefore there’s not enough evidence to make a determination. Just remember we’re all worried about 0.045% of the air the other 99.955 could go to hell. Complete combustion = 100% CO2. I guess we should increase CO, NOx and SO2 so we can decrease that 0.045% to 0.042%. How about we focus on eliminating waste, removing the plastic and styrofoam from the ocean? It’s complete hypocrisy.	UCH4a-IHCC8VqwTld1bnnnXg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH4a-IHCC8VqwTld1bnnnXg	0

If it&#39;s real, great. You supporting a cause that will prevent mass extinction, rising ocean levels, droughts, and increased severity of natural disasters. If it doesn&#39;t exist, okay. You wasted a tad bit of your time going the extra mile to try to prevent these things. Even if it doesn&#39;t exist, it&#39;s better to be safe than sorry.

It should be taken care of by the same people that built the current infrastructure. No need for extra taxes for that because our current taxes already paid for the current infrastructure. Don't need additional taxes to build them. And ehouldn't force taxes just add extra investments in newer technologies.. I've been hearing this climate change, global warming crap since the late eighties, early nineties. I'm sick and tired of hearing it.

In the grand scheme of the planet, thats not that long. Geology tells us that we have had an ice age before, we have tropical climate and every thing in between. Hell we have even been hit with several meteors. The earth has always corrected itself, humans are still here. We have outlasted most every animal.

Walk or ride a bike to work/school, or carpool, use less plastic (A friend of mine did a challenge where she would try to live in way for a month so that the garbage she generated would be able to fit in a sandwich bag.), plant native flowers/bushes/trees, grow your vegetables/herbs/spices (Look online, there are ways to do it in a small apartment). All this is not only better for the environment but will likely save you money, is a healthier way of living and fairly easy to do.<br /><br />If the world lived this way oil would be needed at a far lower rate, but the problem is to get everyone to do it, because although we care and we say we want to help, sometimes we are too lazy to do anything about it, and live in a way that just adds more to the problem at hand.

Search stuff like &quot;Exxon knew all along&quot; and similar phrases to see. So when you observe people repeating what they heard from others like &quot;there&#39;s no science to back up the existence of man-made climate change&quot;, it&#39;s basically the result of a really successful campaign to mislead people into believing that. Unfortunately many still believe man-made climate change is fake to this day, making the problem even more difficult to overcome.

First "Exxon Knew about Climate Change almost 40 years ago" by Scientific American which shows they did research into this before anyone else at the time and quotes them of (ironically) saying they did not hide it. But then reading "Exxon’s Funding of Climate Denial Turned Americans Against Their Own Government for Profit" written by the Huffington post, you can see they were indeed doing so. They likely only published their report on climate change way back because they knew most wouldn't see it back then to deny they fueled denial later so they could continue operating at the expense of the planet without opposition. As a bonus, I also found out later that they actually knew for 60 years. See "Report details how ExxonMobil and fossil fuel firms sowed seeds of doubt on climate change " by the LA Times.

However the real cause of it is not the large masses and overpopulation as is being drilled in our minds by the criminals themselves but it's the multinational corporations themselves. *They* are the ones who refuse to make their supply chain to not be wasteful, harmful for all living beings, inefficient (resulting in so many useful resources being wasted), etc etc. They also bully small farmers and sustsinable and local home industries but they are actually the key to solving climate change and inefficient supply chain. They waste too much money in superficial things and lies like fancy packages and ads for virtue signalling (without real action). And now they are trying to monetize lab virus pandemic, forcing governments to use remdesivir which has been proven useless in COVID-19 treatments even if it's more expensive than HCQ and vit. C and also the vaccine which they will infuse with mercury and other things which will cause new diseases that they will monetize more. Sick. The fast paced urban life is also used to risen stress and so, health issues of the mass. Then they will monetize it too by selling drugs, prostitutes, Hollywood films and music and more.

Global warming could be a net positive for countries in colder climates and detrimental in others, the main issue is that we will have to adapt to changes in the span of decades and thus have to waste alot of resources and intact infrastructure. There are projections about how much net resources global warming might eat up, somewhere along the lines of 5-10% GDP every year globally. We would still be better much off though than if we just kept the oil in the ground and didnt have this massive advancement in development the last 200-100 years.

The biggest problem with moving from fossil fuels is what do we do with existing infrastructure like cars and such? Well, they can be converted to run off hydrogen because remember hydrogen can be burned and it&#39;s cleaner than fossil fuels but you can also make electric cars that use hydrogen in fuel cells to create electricity and all you produce is water vapor. But for electrolysis you need electricity, well you can get that through clean methods like solar panels and hydroelectric plants. So we have a potential solution but humans are too lazy and short sighted to do jack about it. Really moving from fossil fuels to hydrogen is the simplest solution but I doubt it will ever happen because of politics. YUP, because you have two parties with opposing views they will debate us all into the ground, as in our graves, as in kill us with their inept squabbling.

However, a scientist friend suggested I look at the science press (the data) and not the popular press as I may get a shock. So I followed his advice initially with, I admit, a view to finding a fundamental fault with the viewpoint of people like this guy. The trouble is that the data indeed supports the view that climate change has always happened, that temperature is not historically correlated with CO2 levels across millions of years and that the data collection that is driving the current fear and panic is not solid or significant. The mainstream popular message is instead focusing on one small element of the system and not the system as a whole. The debate has lost objectivity and has turned into a religious like debate with violent opinions and name calling and little sensible scientific data based debate. I don&#39;t know why, but that worries me now more than climate change.&quot;<br />If you want to see a rational debate on climate change by actual scientists: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJwayalLpYY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJwayalLpYY</a>	UCikqEkIfNqDRkW0mSk5LF3g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCikqEkIfNqDRkW0mSk5LF3g	0

Try sometime to find a conservative policymaker or writer who thinks the earth&#39;s climate is static and unchanging. The &quot;Climate Change Hoax&quot; people talk about is the notion that it&#39;s a human-caused apocalypse that we can only avert by voting for socialist politicians--and the many scientific frauds committed to promote that idea. So stop screaming &quot;CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL!&quot; at people who already believe that, and some actual communication on this issue might happen.

However the real cause of it is not the large masses and overpopulation as is being drilled in our minds by the criminals themselves but it's the multinational corporations themselves. *They* are the ones who refuse to make their supply chain to not be wasteful, harmful for all living beings, inefficient (resulting in so many useful resources being wasted), etc etc. They also bully small farmers and sustsinable and local home industries but they are actually the key to solving climate change and inefficient supply chain. They waste too much money in superficial things and lies like fancy packages and ads for virtue signalling (without real action).

Sure, the sea level will rise (meaning there will be less lands), but people can (and already are) develop artificial platforms to live on. And the whole &quot;many species will die&quot;? Who cares about that? Natural selection. Human are part of nature too. And while many species will die, many new species will emerge. The only real problem is worse air quality. People have solution for that too -- artificial air.<br /><br />And most importantly, &quot;it&#39;s not gonna happen in my lifetime.

No disrespect toward you I have just researched this and have found that the animal agriculture industry has contributed to the misrepresentation of this myth. Animal Agriculture is the real destroyer of our environment. I do not think this means everyone should buy a hummer but everyone should dramatically reduce their animal products over buying a new car. Again I hope you do not take this as a personal attack by any means and I do believe you too have done research it just may have been corrupted by the meat and dairy industry. http://www.onegreenplanet.org/environment/how-fossil-fuels-are-used-to-produce-meat/ http://www.sustainabletable.org/982/agriculture-energy-climate-change http://washingtonsblog.com/2015/10/leading-cause-of-climate-change-is-animal-agriculture-not-fossil-fuels.html Fossil Fuels More than a third of all raw materials and fossil fuels consumed in the United States are used in animal production (“Ecological Cooking” by Joanne Stepaniak and Kathy Hecker) The production of one calorie of an imal protein requires more than ten times the fossil fuel input as a calorie of plant protein. (The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition) Producing a single hamburger uses enough fuel to drive 20 miles and causes the loss of five times its weight in topsoil. (“The Food Revolution” by John Robbins) Water Nearly half of all the water used in the United States goes to raising animals for food (“The Food Revolution” by John Robbins). It takes more than 2,400 gallons of water to produce 1 pound of meat and only 25 gallons to produce one pound of wheat (“Water Inputs in California Food Production” by Marcia Kreith) To produce a day’s food for one meat-eater takes over 4,000 gallons; for a lacto-ovo vegetarian, only 1200 gallons; for a vegan, only 300 gallons (The Vegetarian Times Complete Cookbook) Animals raised for food produce approximately 130 times as much excrement as the entire human population and animal farms pollute our waterways more than all other industrial sources combined. Run-offs of animal waste, pesticides, chemicals, fertilizers, hormones and antibiotics are contributing to dead zones in coastal areas, degradation of coral reef and health problems. (The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency). Land Raising animals for food (including land used for grazing and land used to grow feed crops) now uses a staggering 30% of the Earth’s land mass. (Livestock’s Long Shadow: Environmental Issues and Options, a 2006 report published by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization) Seven football fields’ worth of land is bulldozed every minute to create more room for farmed animals and the crops that feed them. (The Smithsonian Institution) Of all the agricultural land in the U.S., 80% is used to raise animals for food and grow grain to feed them—that’s almost half the total land mass of the lower 48 states (“Major Uses of Land in the United States” by Marlow Vesterby and Kenneth S. Krupa) Air The massive amounts of excrement produced by livestock farms emit toxic gases such as hydrogen sulfide and ammonia into the air. Roughly 80% of ammonia emissions in the U.S. come from animal waste (The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency). When the cesspools holding tons of urine and feces get full, factory farms will frequently get around water pollution limits by spraying liquid manure into the air, creating mists that are carried away by the wind. (“Neighbors of Vast Hog Farms Say Foul Air Endangers Their Health,” by Jennifer Lee, The New York Times 11 May 2003) Air pollutants generated by animal farms can cause respiratory illness, lung inflammation, and increase vulnerability to respiratory diseases, such as asthma. Emissions of reactive organics and ammonia from animal farming can play a role in the formation of ozone (smog) and air pollution (The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency) Food In the U.S., 70% of the grain grown is fed to animals on feedlots (“Plants, Genes, and Agriculture” by Jones and Bartlet) It takes up to 16 pounds of grain to produce just 1 pound of meat. (The Global Benefits of Eating Less Meat by Mark Gold and Jonathon Porritt). Fish on fish farms must be fed 5 pounds of wild-caught fish to produce one pound of farmed fish flesh (“The Food Revolution” by John Robbins) The world’s cattle alone consume a quantity of food equal to the caloric needs of 8.7 billion people—more than the entire human population on Earth (“The Global Benefits of Eating Less Meat” by Mark Gold and Jonathon Porritt) Climate Change Animal agriculture is responsible for 18% of the total release of greenhouse gases world-wide (this is more than all the cars, trucks, planes, and ships in the world combined) (Livestock’s Long Shadow: Environmental Issues and Options, a 2006 report published by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization) Livestock account for an estimated 9% of global CO2 (Carbon Dioxide) emissions, estimated 35-40% of global CH4 (Methane) emissions and 65% of NO2 (Nitrous Oxide) emissions (Livestock’s Long Shadow: Environmental Issues and Options, a 2006 report published by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization) By replacing your “regular car” with a Toyota Prius the average person can prevent the emission of about 1 tonne of CO2 into the atmosphere, By replacing an omnivorous diet with a vegan diet the average person can prevent the emission of about 1.5 tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere. That’s 50% more CO2 saved! (“It’s better to green your diet than your car”, The New Scientist, December 17, 2005.)

Here's an acual news source "Liberals believe in government action to achieve equal opportunity and equality for all. It is the duty of the government to alleviate social ills and to protect civil liberties and individual and human rights. Believe the role of the government should be to guarantee that no one is in need. Liberal policies generally emphasize the need for the government to solve problems. Conservatives believe in personal responsibility, limited government, free markets, individual liberty, traditional American values and a strong national defense. Believe the role of government should be to provide people the freedom necessary to pursue their own goals. Conservative policies generally emphasize empowerment of the individual to solve problems." https://www.studentnewsdaily.com/conservative-vs-liberal-beliefs/ I think what your saying is the narrative put through by the liberals.

But what can we do to fix this? I know china has started to use giant air filters that can suck the smog filled skies around it to create small sanctuaries of fresh air. Since we all seem so hell bent on keeping gas around and the infrastructure is already there and peak oil has already hit, lets shove all our manufacturing into creating bio fuels out of algae. Its sucks the carbon dioxide out of the air and converts it into oil that can then be processed into usable fuels. Maybe switch over to lab grown meat. Methane produced by cows alone contribute huge amounts to global warming. Quirker fixes in that arena is to utilize red sea kelp mixed into the grain. Think beno for cows ;) This is just a quick overview of what can be done if we put out minds to it. Stop with the doom and gloom and start thinking up ways to fix the problem!

Great low temperatures and high temperatures. and again couldn't stopping the deforestation of the amazon and and planting more plants in general help lower the co2 levels before they because "too catastrophic". btw i'm not being a "denier", i just want to ask questions and see if i am myself wrong. one last thing. i just did a bunch of reading, and the was a time in history where oxygen actually killed most of the "organisms" at the time.

Most of the plants that survive in hot and humid environments and that can survive global warming are plants many animals can't use or eat. Climate change has been one of the main sources of mass extinctions. Even the KT extinction owed more to the climate change caused by the asteroid than the asteroid itself.

I repeat <b><i>NO ONE</i></b> denies the data... but you listen to the professor guy in this video, and he says nothing but &quot;could&quot; and &quot;might.&quot; We simply don&#39;t have enough of the right kinds of data to make any meaningful predictions. <b><i>ALL</i></b> attempts to do so have been completely <i>wrong!</i> It&#39;s a difference of opinion in how we <i>interpret</i> the data... <i>and</i> what to <i>do</i> about it.<br /><br />No alternative energy source has come even <i>close</i> to matching the scalability and efficiency of fossil fuels. Any attempts to reduce fossil fuel consumption before something <i>better</i> is discovered <b><i>WILL</i></b> result in <b><i>MILLIONS</i></b> of deaths – most from third-world countries...<br /><br />The debate is about whether or not the increase in atmospheric CO2 will inevitably result in <i>catastrophic</i> environmental changes, and what we can <i>or should</i> do about it. &quot;Alarmists&quot; like those in this video want you to believe in a scenario like in the movies &quot;2012&quot; or &quot;The Day After Tomorrow,&quot; but fail to mention that the ocean levels, for example, are expected to rise over the next <i>few</i> <b><i>hundred</i></b> years... and that&#39;s the <i>worst case</i> scenario...<br /><br />Climate change exists. However, ever since we&#39;ve been studying it, <b><i>none</i></b> of the prediction models have been accurate enough to say with <i>any</i> certainty what will <i>actually</i> happen. <b><i>Of course</i></b> we should be researching non-polluting sources of energy... but pouring money into things like wind and solar that have proven to be impossible to scale <i>isn&#39;t</i> helping anything... and neither is the type of fear mongering in this video.

Science is about *_testing_* your interpretations, weeding out all other possibilities until your interpretation is proven to be accurate. There are so many other variables in play that it's _impossible_ to do that with the climate. Governments have _a lot_ to gain... (Cap and trade, anyone?) So, yes... In a way... I don't think these scientists are _lying,_ but they aren't allowed to _challenge_ or _test_ the so-called "consensus" or they'll lose their funding. When government only gives money to those who support the interpretation that benefits them, I'm gonna be skeptical of the results... Also... The "98% consensus" thing *_IS_* an absolute _lie!_ That figure comes from a study that was _extremely_ loose on its criteria... I suggest you look it up... As for the "equilibrium" comment... You kinda proved it yourself... Earth is habitable because there are systems in place to balance out the severe extremes of nature. Without an atmosphere, we would freeze to death at night, and fry in the morning. When atmospheric CO2 increases, other systems work to balance it out. Vegetation thrives, which could be why there's more vegetation now than at any time in the last 100-or-so years. I've given several reasons for why I don't trust the current narrative. But first and foremost: it's just politics, not science. Pushing a political agenda as scientific fact is _dangerous!_	UCrU9gOLF88lSISt6w_pD1Mg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrU9gOLF88lSISt6w_pD1Mg	1	Ugy9-ysa9crOcafRvQx4AaABAg	Lance Miller

Empirical science is really all about making up interpretations to explain the data. If the interpretation (or explanation) is inconsistent with the data, we throw it away. It turns out nobody is able to really attack the large underlying explanations on climate change anymore. So, according to what you claim is "the claim", the earth can not maintain its "natural equilibrium" because of the additional CO2. The natural equilibrium of CO2? I don't really know what is meant by that. Whether it is going to be catastrophic or not is subjective and not a scientific question. The process that causes CO2 to cause warming is well understood. You know the heater in your house causes warming. You can still make it look like it has nothing to do with temperature or even cause cooling if you change other variables accordingly (turning on air conditioning, for example). Turns out historic temperatures make sense only if you attribute a warming effect to CO2, because without it, temperatures would be expected to be lower. Yes, there are many variables that play a role. It just so happens that within the past 200 years or so, very few of them have changed considerably. Methane is indeed a potent greenhouse gas, but we have produced so little of it, compared to CO2, that it does not do that much. Water vapor has a hard time staying in the atmosphere, which is why it often rains. If we were to try to put massive amounts of water into the atmosphere, if would just rain back down again. Air hold more water vapor at higher temperatures and higher temperatures cause more water vapor in the atmosphere. If left on its own, this positive feedback loop reaches an equilibrium state at some point. However, if you increase temperatures independently (let's say by 0.1°), the equilibrium point is pushed a lot higher (maybe 0.5° or something). As you can see, we only have indirect access to changing the water vapor variable through CO2, which is why thinking about what we can do about it ultimately leads to CO2. If I understood you correctly, you think the government systematically surpresses the truth. This needs some serious evidence. What about all the other governments in the world? Do they all conspire to make the scientists produce consistent, but really false results? It would also imply that all the scientists are somewhat unethical and are fine with their entire careers based on lies. I really can't make it work.

It's never a good idea to take someone at their word just because they claim to be an expert... Bill Nye, for example, is probably one of the most outspoken public figures about climate change, and he's not even a scientist... He's a mechanical engineer... I'm willing to have my mind changed when presented with actual facts and a reasonable argument. The claims regarding climate change, though, aren't about the data, they're about the _interpretation_ of that data, and they claim that interpretation to be fact... I'm sorry, but that's not how science works... The claim is that we've introduced so much new CO2 into the atmosphere that there's no possible way for the Earth to maintain its natural equilibrium, and the results will be catastrophic. That's not a fact, that's a prediction... One that doesn't even look at historic CO2 levels. (Hint: throughout Earth's history, CO2 levels have almost _never_ correlated with global temperatures; there have been colder times with higher CO2 levels, and hotter times with lower levels) The factors that contribute to global climate are virtually infinite, yet I have seen no real effort to take any variable except CO2 into consideration... CO2 isn't even that potent of a greenhouse gas... Methane and water vapor have _far_ more impact... But _all_ the focus is on CO2... Not to mention the fact that there is a very real financial incentive for scientists to "tow the line" since "deniers" can't get a penny of government money... That doesn't sound like the scientific method to me...	UCrU9gOLF88lSISt6w_pD1Mg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrU9gOLF88lSISt6w_pD1Mg	1	Ugy9-ysa9crOcafRvQx4AaABAg	Lance Miller

He really is not a climate scientist, but even if he was, it is not a good idea to believe what people claim in videos on youtube without fact checking, especially if they do not cite any sources. It just so happens to be that the shorter video you sent is misleading or even plain wrong in almost everything. Feel free to pick any of his claims and I will show you how they are misleading. This is of course only useful if you are willing to potentially change your mind. You probably like Crowder's "change my mind"-format as well, so I'm sure you see being open to changing one's mind as a good thing.

There must be <b>some</b> way for everyone to contribute to fix this major problem, young and old.	UC0IRrDuC4u_Ejq-8bilhl0Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0IRrDuC4u_Ejq-8bilhl0Q	0

Let me explain. <br /><br />First off, climate change has been going on ever since... Well, ever. Climate change is a natural Earth process that has been going bon for billions of years.<br /><br />Second, the Arctic areas of the world are just reigons of ground covered by a lot of permafrost. If the permafrost melts, imagine how much area the Earth regains.<br /><br />Third, mass flooding Will not occur. For example, take a glass of water and put two ice cubes into it. Wait for the cubes to melt. No change occurs. Imagine that, just bigger. <br /><br />In a way, climate change is actually more beneficial than anyone will make you think. this is basic science that anyone with an IQ over 5 could understand. <br /><br />Just clearing up some misconceptions about global warming.

The original intent of the scientific method was to get one to check his/her findings and present the work for others to evaluate for themselves. Currently, &quot;science&quot; is presented as an indisputable fact on which acceptance is mandatory. As if every scientfic breakthrough did not have to overthrow and older &quot;indisputable scientfic fact&quot;. Global Warming lost the argument long ago as it tried to reclass itself as &quot;climate change&quot;. Even now, Spring is interrupted by an ago old rythem to bring a cold change in climate.

Of course the episodes cab still have many true aspects but it&#39;s one&#39;s like this that denies the facts. You reading this probably want to use the argument that &quot;Well they had that environmental professor guy&quot; well guess What? Environmental scientists and professors understand little more about how the climate works than you do. The fact of the matter is, the earth is not getting globally warmer. Yes, areas are experiencing climate change but they have been constantly experiencing it from the very beginning, the climate would be doing more or less the same thing it&#39;s doing now regardless of fossil fuels.

And the reason there is no ice age is because our increased pollution from achriculture and other sources has stopped that cycle of warm and cold.

UgxBqS3fa2RlwKHwNy14AaABAg	0	0	2018-02-20 10:42:00	IMCR	Well Adam it seems I need to repeat myself, &quot;it&#39;s not that simple&quot;<br /><br />First of all, our amounts of emissions are questionable when you factor in volcanoes, melting ice with methane gas deposits, all animals on earth and the decomposing of leafs. <br /><br />Second. The rising sea level argument is full of miss information and bad logic: 1. The amount of water on this planet is finite therefore we know the upper limit of the water rising. According to some of the more outspoken scientists in this field the upper limit is 70 meters. But because the vast majority of that ice is already in water, the water level from that specific ice won&#39;t effect the sea level. 2. We don&#39;t know how much of that ice is hollowed or big gas deposits (Seriously search for it, we have found a lot of gas deposit in these ice reserves) 3. No study have factored in ground rising. Every year the a huge portion of the planet expands vertically, this happen for a lot of reasons and can differ from where you are on the globe. The most common these are &quot;the depressurizing of landmasses after the ice age&quot;. This is a big subject and is left out of reports presented.<br />This annoys me because the the threat is big enough as it is, lying, cheating and deceiving people only makes them distrust you. it&#39;s short sighted solution to a long sided problem.<br /><br />Third. This video is call to arms, the problem is that most people don&#39;t know how to to lower their CO2 emissions. This is so because most scientists in this field don&#39;t have an answer to how lower the emissions. This is so complicated and includes a lot of math. The problem become worse when politicians and research grants are involved.<br />Most politicians are as ignorant as the rest of us, except they got a silver tongue and lack the self insight to recognize that they are not suited to decide on these things.<br />When they hear that people are concerned global warming, they see it as an easy win. But when they win it becomes a bit harder because now they got the power and promise to do something about it. To solve this they consult with scientists. But because the politician needs to show results, the politician won&#39;t search for the labs and scientists with the most potential to solve anything. The politician will search for the labs and scientist that will give him something he can sell to the people who elected him. Because most of these suggestions are bad and unproductive, they sometimes accidentally hit a big company or an industry. This leads to them getting a hand in the mix. Because this is a costly investment to protect your business from bad laws and regulations, most businesses invest extra to push the law back even more. This got 2 benefits for them: 1. they got more leeway if this happens again 2. it is often very profitable.<br />When these 3 groups (big business, politicians and greedy scientists) they can do a lot of damage very quickly, and when people hear this call to arms this is the solution that will be offered and most people will take even if it hurts this planet even more that is already done to it.<br /><br />Why am I so annoyed? Because people like you Adam make people into climate change deniers. Educating people with small white lies only makes people angry when they find out you lied to them and with most people you don&#39;t get a second chance.<br /><br />I know we need to do something about this... but this is just pissing me off	UCsAYpCYRiXQarcEOZ3rG9bQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsAYpCYRiXQarcEOZ3rG9bQ	0

Humans living their modern lives isn't the problem since it would be hard to de-modernize civilization. The problem is that oil is being used for civilization, and oil is turning into CO2 and that CO2 is going into the atmosphere and warming the earth.

You should ask yourself why the only figures you see presented are based on emissions per capita. What does the atmosphere care about - total CO2 or CO2 per capita? And what about CO2 absorption by country? Then you can look up the measurements from the satellites designed to measure CO2 (and other) emissions and ask for the explanation as to why the most emissions detected are from the most populous, and underdeveloped, countries? Then ask what is the gas that causes most global warming effect? When the answer is water vapour (because they are scientists, right?) then ask - wouldn&#39;t it be easier to remove water vapour than CO2 from the air (in terms of energy use)? Then also ask, if man made CO2 is a minute fraction of natural CO2 emissions, and the concentration of CO2 is inversely proportional to the cost of capture and removal, why are we not focusing on reducing natural sources of CO2? Then ask why is everything in &quot;CO2 equivalent terms&quot; when methane, for example, produced mainly by agriculture, is not absorbed by trees? Then ask why we are OK with agriculture producing enormous local pollution (air, sea and land) yet the product is mainly exported for someone else&#39;s benefit (oh, yes - money). The main problem with the BS you see about climate change is not that it is happening, but the focus on one segment of industry and bizarre efforts to pin the blame on developed nations when the opposite is true.

So how about instead of spending so much time and resources debating about whether its human caused or not we actually use that time and resources to find ways and technologies for us to adapt so we can better take on the problem of the warming earth.<br /><br />All these teens and kids in the comments right now, saying how they are scared. This is where we come in. Pretty soon the world is going to be ours and we will have to inherit a planet riddled with problems left by the ignorance of the previous generation. So what are you going to do about it, how are you going to make the world better around you both now and when you grow up. We can&#39;t make the same mistakes of the last generation. Our planet simply will not be able to survive. <br /><br />Thanks	UCbVBXi73m1hQ0gCRJ5jq9tw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbVBXi73m1hQ0gCRJ5jq9tw	0

CO2 and warming make it possible for us to feed people now ... the real worldwide emergency is 150 extra new people on earth every MINUTE, requiring expanding farmlands.

If it’s manmade we can do something about it. If it’s natural then we’re focusing on the wrong problem and therefore the wrong solutions. There have been scientists that looked at the temperature of the sun and compared its fluctuations with the temperatures of the Earth. Interestingly it matched almost perfectly with the rise and fall of temperatures on Earth. Certainly we do need to take better care of the Earth. We can’t breath petrol fumes, the plastic has an effect on the planet and we still need the wildlife for a healthy planet. But the solutions need to not create a worse problem in the process	UCZ-sNxYPgPu6PHtwEhLRKkA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ-sNxYPgPu6PHtwEhLRKkA	1	Ugw2t7iN_XJuOUtpuDh4AaABAg	Suhas Das

I think you will appreciate it by the time you get to the end. 1. You are still in school. Not graduated ... let me guess ... a sophomore? ... meaning: wise fool. You know enough to think you know something, but not enough not know you are clueless. (Item 4 helps explain this) 2. Unlike you, I have graduated - more than once. One of those degrees is an MA in astrobiology, from Cambridge University. Admittedly, astrobiology is not geology. However, the concept of what does or does not effect life on Earth or any other planet in the universe - such as relative climate - is very relevant. A single Earth Science and a geology class does not qualify you to voice your thoughts or opinions. I do not claim to be an expert or have any of the answers. 3. I was TA in Earth Science and - until recently - a research scientist for NASA Ames. I'd say my words come with a slightly higher degree of credibility; than a college sophomore, from Podunk State College, with 2 science classes under his belt. Given all these points - thus far - I would like to point out ... 4. There currently is no way to "cool down" the Earth, the opportunity to do that has past. Instead, all we can hope to do is slow it down, limit it's severity and make preparations for what is to come. The fact you do not realize this basic reality tells me that you do not have a clue what you are babbling about and have a LOT more schooling to do. 5. Even if there was a way to "cool down" the Earth - and the time to have done that was not already passed - the fact you are ignorant enough to think humanity would do what it takes to solve this problem? Let's put it this way ... the current US president - the leader of one of the largest contributing nations to global warming - has removed EPA restrictions, pulled out of the Paris Accords (too stupid to realize Paris is on the same planet as Pittsburgh), and does not know the difference between climate and weather - you REALLY think you have a clue how to "cool down" the planet? 6. You speak of what is or is not relevant. As with item 5, you are not educated enough to know what is or is not relevant. For example: item 5. You want to help make a change and reduce the effects of climate change? Step 1: STOP MAKING IT WORSE! Vote Mango Mussolini - along with most of the Republicans - out of office and put in people willing to admit, "Ice is melting. Must be getting warmer." 7. The fact you do not even know what is or is not relevant is scary. Perhaps before you speak you should try to grasp how things connect to each other. 8. Wonderful... it's 5 years in the future. You have an MA in Geology and working in Houston, making 80K/yr for some oil company (congrats on the job, by the way - even though it is part of the problem)... On the bright side, President Circus Peanut is long gone. The future POTUS and members of the house and Senate actually seem to care about the environment again. Even though you have traded in your current ideals for a nice paycheck, what will anyone - with any degree of power or authority - going to do about it? Do you think people will stop or be forced to stop killing themselves? There is too much money and profit in pollution. 9. Yes, people killing themselves... As I said before, there is nothing wrong with the planet. The Earth does not give a damn if the average temperature is a few degrees hotter or colder. The Earth is not going anywhere ... we are! But hey, in 10 years, I'm sure Exxon/Mobil will be paying you 6 figures to help them determine the best new ways to extract fossil fuels from the Earth. Having the desire to help is admirable. Learning about the Earth and what makes it 'tick' is a noble goal. But you need so much more. You not only need the knowledge and desire, you need the power and ability to make that change. Shy of being the next Koch Brother, holding a high political office or the future CEO of Shell Oil, you could implement a second degree plan to run with your current degree plan ... Applied Physics (You do get to have 18 credits - 6 classes - knows as 'electives' in any area you desire). What additional classes would you need to graduate with TWO degrees at the same time? I needed 8 extra classes for a second degree: psychobiology. As electives I took some psychology classes, added in psychopharmacology, animal and human anatomy, psychophysiology and neuroscience. By the time it was all said and done, I had 4 classes more than I needed to have graduated with one MA degree. Instead, I graduated with a TWO degrees - at the same time - by doing so. How is this relevant? With your current course work, all you would need is a couple physics classes and an extra math class or two. As with my degrees in Astrobiology and Psychobiology, MANY classes - such as biology, physiology, chemistry, organic chemistry... were requirements for either degree. Remember - you could consider 6 of those extra classes to be part of your elective core for your Earth Sciences degree ... and Earth sciences would be electives for applied physics. Also realize: a 2nd degree works out to only one extra class per semester (with an occasional summer class or two) Why applied physics? What will make people - especially rich people - the people with all the power - give up fossil fuels? An alternative that can make them even more money. The ONLY way to help "cool down" the Earth - and still be alive to make it happen - is to provide an avenue for the rich to get richer in the process of doing so. Knowing what makes the Earth tick is one part of the process, the other part is having the ability to create/discover/invent an alternative. Please note: I am NOT trying to goad you into anything. I am trying to WAKE YOU UP!	UCYeJzwE7y41zKr9HfgRcH0Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYeJzwE7y41zKr9HfgRcH0Q	1	Ugw2t7iN_XJuOUtpuDh4AaABAg	Suhas Das

Also yes, there was a time when there was more CO2 (that's carbon dioxide) in the atmosphere. Also I never said I have graduated from college yet, I just said I am majoring in it, meaning I'm still in college. It would seem to me that you think you know everything, and when someone who knows more than you about this subject, or has studied it before comes up, you try to knock them down and put yourself above others. I'm no expert in Climate change, I can admit that, but at least I actually can find ways to maybe cool down the earth and better ourselves, instead of trying to one up someone on the internet.

Having read that babbling nonsense you just wrote, I'd say it was either some online university or a state subsidized college. Then again ... There are a number of "christian colleges" in the US, such as Bob Jones University. In such places, you fail out of school if you get the answers right. (Ie. How old is the planet? They expect to see the answer as "approximately 6,000 years," while the correct answer is 4.6 billion years.) As everyone else on the planet is aware: Not only does the USA have the worst healthcare system in the free world, it's education system is at the bottom of the list, as well. In fact, since November 2016, America has acquired and solidified the position as the home of the dumbest, most willfully ignorant people to have EVER walked the Earth. Fun fact: 7% of Americans actually believe chocolate milk comes from brown cows. As a "university graduate" presumably you are not part of that 7%. Still, over 70% of all Americans - in the 21st century - believe angels are real ... They gather together every Sunday to praise their imaginary friends. Consider what I just wrote and ask yourself, why should anyone take you seriously. You live in a country where Trump University was a thing! FYI ... during the time of the dinosaurs there was LESS CO2 and MORE O2. (That is 'less carbon dioxide' and 'more oxygen'.) I also presume you are one of these ignorant morons who think weather and climate are the same thing and 'if global warming is real, how is there snow in January... much less a blizzard?' Lastly, you said you 'went to university'and not a word about actually graduating. Flunk out of DeVry after the 1st semester?

Dont say that most experts believe we are the sole cause for it, Thousands of years ago there was much more carbon dioxide in the earth, meaning it was much warmer. Also there are ways to cool the earth, such as putting aerosols into the atmosphere, finding a way to speed up the carbon cycle, and, although this would take more than we can, carbon capture.

From what I have seen no viable solution has been made that covers all the needs or is totally eco friendly. Wind power would be great but unless you have a rolling plain to put it in you have to clear out a lot of trees. The Light bulbs we made that we made that use less energy are filled with toxic chemicals that have to be disposed of carefully or the poisons end up in the ground. Water Power is great if you have a river to run it. And solar panels like the Light bulbs have to be replaced and parts of them again have harmful chemicals in them. The previous generations have tried to come up with solutions but they all seem to end up being neutral. Sadly my generation is not doing much better. We seem to be stuck on the solutions are right we just have to implement them better. Or "Give it to me old man You are not doing it right" Hope the ones coming after us can do better but please do not make the same mistakes we made. Don't sit there and yell at the corporations that they need to stop using fossil fuels cause until we discover something cheaper and more profitable they won't . Take not to the streets in protest for your words will not be heard. Take to the sciences and build a better mousetrap. Build an electric car that is less expensive than a gas powered car and watch the masses buy it. Find a compound that can be mass produced, burns clean and is less expensive than processing raw oil. If it is even just as efficient as gas but is cheaper it will sell. In other words don't try to make big oil stop. Play their game and play it better. Please forgive the ramblings of a pleb.

The debate over whether it's human-caused is important because the people who say that it's not human-caused, consequently also say that the problem isn't with humanities use of fossil fuels or the excessive release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and thus choose to continue to burn these resources in order to make money. This makes it so that the big oil companies have an excuse to continue their practices and just straight up ignore any form of restriction to their massive money making business.

The narrative that normal people can save the world by recycling and biking everywhere instead of driving keeps the people distracted from the main sources of pollution, who in turn face little to no real responsibility in changing their ways. Sure, they have to pay a fine if something like an oil spill happens, but that doesnt change their methods nor practices. We should hold corporations responsible for their actions and realize they are to blame	UC5i2NHia4_9g4Y1XHxsqJoQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5i2NHia4_9g4Y1XHxsqJoQ	0

And this extreme climate is an exaggeration. First of all warming centers around the poles. So it could warm 2 degrees in a century at the poles and not at all at the equator. Next how much do you think the earth is going to warm? It’s not going to be instantaneous like everyone tries to tell you it would be. There will be periods of warming then periods of cooling. 2 degrees Celsius over a decade is what people are pushing. If this is true then that minor change will be great.

If we are serious about mitigating climate change, we need to recognize the importance of the United Nations and WorldWatch Institute findings stating that animal agriculture puts out more green house gases then all the cars, boats, planes and trains in the entire world. <br /><br />WorldWatch report: <a href="http://www.worldwatch.org/node/6294">http://www.worldwatch.org/node/6294</a><br /><br />United Nations report: <a href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/a0701e/a0701e00.HTM">http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/a0701e/a0701e00.HTM</a><br /><br />All this just so we can enjoy the taste of dead animals, something that provides no health benefits beyond what plants provide, as noted by the American Dietetic Association, the Australian Food Guidelines and many other institutions and governments. When you eat an animal, all you are doing is gaining the nutrition that the animal itself gained from eating plants on the ground, and then digested. You’re consuming pre-digested nutrients.

We need carbon to maintain the carbon cycle so plants can breathe and expell oxygen in the air. Plants flourish when growing adjacent to coal mines. The solution is quite simple, plant more trees! Climate upheavals can be caused by many factors but not limited to water vapors, methane, volcanos, sun spots, solar flares, etc. So how do you captain planet and the planeteers propose we stop the proverbial &quot;man bear pig&quot; without putting countries livelihood back to the pre-industrial era and destroying their economy?

Their is also the problem of plants being carbon neutrual. When the bamboo dies it will release the carbon it captured through decomposition.

For example, China has a native giant species of bamboo called Moso bamboo. One hectare (an area roughly the size of an athletics track) of this species can store up to 250 tons of carbon (Qi, 2009.

This doesn’t match the stature of many trees, but it is still big enough to be significant. It is not all about size, however. How fast a plant grows has a part in determining how much CO2 it can absorb in a given time. In this respect, bamboo wins hands-down: it grows faster than many trees, growing up to 1.2 meters per day. In fact, bamboo holds the Guinness World Record for the world’s fastest growing plant	UCci2J2dKTy-6YWax8HRP89Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCci2J2dKTy-6YWax8HRP89Q	1	UgyYJNUzrtmtqCs8tMh4AaABAg	Marco Alcala

But field test are also done, spectrometers in space can actually see where certin gases are in the atmosphere and PPM traking activly shows us co2 trends.

It definitely sucks to hear, cause nobody wants to admit they’re contributing to the problem. We all are in some way or another. But it is a fact that cutting out animal products is one of the most influential ways to reduce your carbon footprint. Not having a kid IS beneficial to the environment, but don’t ignore or fight the other options... except for maybe suicide. That’s going a little TOO far.

Now add a cow a massive meatmonster that eats too, now you‘re getting only 1% of the original energy. This means we have to use way more land and resources to feed us. This results in loss of vegetation and increase in production of greenhouse gases. Additionally cows themselves produce a massive amount of greenhouse gases just by farting and burping. I know this sounds ridiculous but due to cows being ruminants they create about 500 liters of methane a day per cow. Methane is 25 times more toxic to our atmosphere than CO2 in comparison. I am not a vegan nor a vegetarian btw, but science is science and facts are facts.

The land taken by animal farming is huge, and massive deforestation occurs to build them. Cows produce a huge amount of waste and methane which releases loads of greenhouse gasses, hence heating up the earth. Humans can survive without meat as fruit, veg and nuts provide all the essential nutrients needed to stay alive.

Capitalism is a cause of said greed but said greed is not the driving force of capitalism. Demand is. Demand drives innovation, and the market rewards those who rush to fill those demands. Those useless products exist because there is demand for it. The state of resource and labor exploitation exists because consumer demand is high and they don't care what it costs to procure it. I'm not "praising" it, that's stupid. Likewise it is stupid to think it as evil. It is neither good nor evil. It just is. Like a fire that can warm or burn your house down, it is an artificial force that responds to what is put into it. And with an ever increasing demand for clean energy, companies rise to fill that need. Wind farms, hydroelectric dams, development of improved solar panels, thorium nuclear reactors. It is there, because there is demand for it. Also you need to evaluate what happens when you apply a 'cold shock' to an economic system by forcibly removing it entirely and how damaging it can be to a population. Soviets tried that. Bad results.	UCJUIsTCwQTV8OVGll_KIkvw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJUIsTCwQTV8OVGll_KIkvw	1	Ugy9wrxjvIZ45ySbavJ4AaABAg	Spaw gremk

Capitalism literally making it more difficult, because it's not about what we aren't doing, it's about what we ARE doing. We are over-producing way too much of what no one needs, and completely mismanaging everything else. You're praising Capitalism for 'solving' (which it's not a solution, just the vague promise of one) an issue it's causing. Capitalism is the system that rewards wealth above everything, it is the system that rewards owners for cutting any corner they can. Every 'benefit' you get from capitalism is a product of exploitation. In order for capitalism to survive and provide benefits to it's population, it requires capital. This capital doesn't just appear out of thin air, it needs to come from somewhere. It's stolen, resources, labor, to maximize profits 'buy' low, sell high.

Till 2017 its 37 years from the earth&#39;s existence. I dont wanna say that we are not hurting the ecosystem, but 137 years of record is very very short time to make statistic conclusions on. I dont know for sure, but lets say for example in cycles of 500 years due to tiny changes in orbit or axis the earth may have small climate changes like this one. Dont get me wrong I absolutely think we should lower the pollution and live more eco, but this data is totally unreliable.

The suns flux energy for 1 meter squared on the earth surface is about 1370 watts, the global avreage is 341W/m^2. This radiant energy is ballanced by a number of energy reflections and immision procceses that result in an equallibrium or zero-energy balance state, 8f not the world would keep getting warmer. Only less than one third of light is reflected back to space, most of it is absorbed, the earth balances this energy by radiating out proportional to the earths surface area. Now an object that raidiats 239W/m^2 has a surface temp of -19°C but the actual avreage surface temperature of earth is 14°C. So why is earth 33°C hotter than it should be? Mostly because of greenhouse gases, gases like H20 gas, CO2, CH4, N20, and O3 are almost transparent to short wavelength light coming from the sun but absorb up to 80% of long wave length IR light being irradiated off the earths surface. If we did not have green houses gases then the gas that makes up 99% of the atmosphere would not absorb radiation and cause global average temps to drop well bellow -20°C. But this 1% of gass keeps us from freezing our asses off. But CO2 only makes up 1/400th of these greenhouse gases but is resbonsible for 20% of the radiation absorbed. Now can you see why its a big deal that CO2 went from 270ppm to 400ppm? Last time we had that much carbon in the air is believed to be 2.5 million years, where the days were 15°c hotter. Now do you see what im saying?	UCVnSNnKSlScu2P7bTaA5pBQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVnSNnKSlScu2P7bTaA5pBQ	1	Ugw5Akx3RLg_uMTOqJJ4AaABAg	Cameron Kuhns

So it sticks around in the lower atmosphere. It also has a diffrent light spectrum so it absorbs radiation diffrently, it also has a diffrwnt heat capacity and thermal conductivity. 300ppm to 400ppm is a big diffrence, the last time it was that high (before hummans existed) the earth was avreage of 11f° hotter than it is today.

Until we are over the other side (a long time) we won&#39;t be able to stop that. This has been happening way before we started ruining it. Even if we stop and fix everything it will still happen since volcanoes give out carbon dioxide. A lot of it as well. there needs to be more research done on this topic because though we are making it worse, we cant stop it and never will.

People are afraid the we will become the next Venus, but fail to realize the differences between Earth and Venus is why Venus the way it is. Venus has no natural satellite, while the Earth does (it is the largest planet to satellite ratio in the solar system). One day on Venus is longer than its year.

I understand your formula; a+b=c, so more of a or b means more c. However, the world is not a simple cause-effect system when you observe it as a whole. Plant life does not depend solely on CO2, just as you cannot depend solely on the Calcium in milk, but still need it to function. Like plants, we require a whole host of variables to sit within a range. Temperature, nutrition, calories, light, water of an appropriate quality, these are actually the same factors that plant life depends on. You can throw all the CO2 you want at phytoplankton, it's to no avail if the water is so acidic it melts it. Unfortunately, we acidify the oceans, warm the planet, and fill the air with particulate matter, and that has an effect on all life, us, plants, other animals, fungus. It isn't just the one thing... It's ALL of the things we do wrong, combined together, to slowly slaughter the rock we desperately cling to for sustenance. There's a reason parasites don't tend to kill their hosts rapidly, if at all, because a parasite depends upon it's host for sustenance.

The thing is, we have a platen that is heated up and cooled down &quot;on it&#39;s own&quot;. It&#39;s not like our world was frozen 300 years ago and we reheated it using fossil fuels. Yes, system exists, it is well balanced, and it was designed (sorry, but I do believe that) to sustain our world as we know it. Global warmers say humanity has influenced this balance and tilted it toward warming. But what you need to realize is the origin of that balance. Is it self-sustained or artificially controlled? Most agree it&#39;s self-sustained, in other words our planet has balanced-out it&#39;s surface temperature through self-balancing. So why all of a sudden those who agree refuse to accept that if that&#39;s the case - than the planet will re-balance itself again back to equilibrium? No, I realize that some believe that &quot;re-balancing&quot; would kill most humans on the planet, but that&#39;s even more of a fantasy than the man-caused global warming... just saying...

There is something like 0.0003% CO2 in the atmosphere... The majority of which is from nature... The oceans have risen and fallen nonstop for millions of years. We have ice ages and warming periods. Entire cities have been destroyed and or are sunken below sea level... (great diving spots by the way). Droughts have happened through out history. The worst drought ever recorded was during the 1930s dust bowl... The entire nation was starving and rationing food.<br />These professors and scientists are not going to tell you the truth when it brings them and their companies so much money. It&#39;s called job security.<br />It all started with congress.<br />They were going to defund much of NASA and NOAA. Then man made global warming became a thing.

Maybe 20 years thats worth anything. Compared to the time scales on which the geological record shows climate fluctuations (ice ages anyone?) It is a nanosecond. <br /><br />The climate is shifting and we will adjust or die. No amount of human effort will stop it because the forces and factors are larger than anything our feeble technology and energy capabilities permit.<br /><br />The right place to spend our effort is on developing drought resistant crops, fresh water management and conservation techniques, and weather modeling and/or management, etc... to safeguard the lives of those impacted by the inevitable shifts that have already begun.<br /><br />If you believe you can stop nature then you are deceived. Sadly it is a distraction from what we can do, and many people have and will die as a result of our ego, misplaced passion and ignorance.

Ever hear of the ice age? Well there have been a few, the earth was one entirely covered with ice. It was also mostly deserts, the poles were like tropical jungles. We have contributed to global warming, in both good and bad ways. Ever hear about the American buffalo hearts that spanned hundreds of miles ? How much methane did they produce? And methane is much worse than CO2. Climate change is just another fad to worry the world and sell newspapers. Remember the population explosion ? Solent green, no so much these days.

NASA, scientists, astronauts. But we have yet to see the change of the fact ourselves. How do we know earth isn&#39;t really round or the moon is real? Or space for the fact? We put trust in others, such as the government to tell us facts but we have yet to see this for ourselves. We trust others to tell us information, but not ourselves. Think about it<br /><br />I&#39;m not saying global warming isn&#39;t real, but I wonder over these things, and you should too.

Humans have very little to do with it, but hey let&#39;s say this was all our fault, what about the climate change that happened thousands of years ago, when a ton of species built for the cold died out. Did they burn fossil fuels and and make the term of the earth rise?	UCB6I62wtDaj9tH4UFPj-6-A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB6I62wtDaj9tH4UFPj-6-A	0

The changes in our climate are defying our natural cycle. Also your question is naive. Let's suppose I have an empty pool in my backyard. Today I fill that pool with water. We all accept the fact that the pool is filled because I filled it. Also let's say that it's my job to fill the pool every summer. Now let's agree that there were times in the past that the pool was filled and I wasn't there to fill it. The reason can be anything: melted snow, rainfall, past owners etc. By your logic, I'm not allowed to accept the idea that I filled the pool with water because there were times in the past where the pool was filled when it couldn't have been me. The fact that man is changing the climate today is not contradicted by changes in the climate in the past.

The AGW thing is a bunch of baloney. e.g. the oceans have actually receded slightly and the ice caps have increased. But all of Adam&#39;s videos play with the stats at least a little bit. You sort of have to to keep it funny. <br /><br />But, oddly, this one isn&#39;t funny.<br /><br />Remember, CO2 is not a poison or a pollutant. It is necessary for life. And when it increases, life that depends on it increases (i.e. trees and plants). And they turn it into oxygen, which is necessary for the non-plant life forms. <br /><br />And climate change has been happening in both directions since the planet was formed.

The only one I seen is &quot;everybody should buy electric cars&quot; the people who say that normally are Suburban twats and Urban twats and what they are saying is impossible because gas cars are cheaper for now and easier to work on also to my knowledge there are no electric 18 wheelers or tractors or pickup trucks too	UCKAFr5DSEdVEL6l6zsK0j7A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKAFr5DSEdVEL6l6zsK0j7A	0

Of course we can influence it slightly or dramatically, but it&#39;s not like cave men drove their dually trucks to creat green house gases to get out of the ice age. There are several other factors, both big and small, that we can&#39;t influence.I&#39;m not saying we shouldn&#39;t try, just want to point something out.

UggAVt4YyZUraXgCoAEC.8VNAddinNdX8VZjl0JAx2n		0	2017-07-28 16:43:52	J W	Because scientists in Russia discover the Sun is cooling down with less solar magnetic activity. The last time the Earth was going through a big mini ice age cycle was in the 14th to the early 15th century, and early records have gone back to the Medieval Times . Germany for example was known to making great wine until the winter came and caused them to change their course from making wine to making beer which is what they are known for today with Octoberfest and everything. This is only another cycle that Earth will go through and it won't be the last. I went through the history books and almost all the records show of severe cooling and harsh winter times. Sooner or later as we know we will not have a global warming but will have another mini ice age cycle as the sun is cooling down and solar activity is very low right now. Even the guy who came up with this whole global warming thing today admitted he was wrong. But the damage he made caused guys like jet riding hypocrite Al Gore and other crazy nut jobs to believe in the whole thing and forcing fear mongering onto people for a quick buck and Adam is no different as we are watching him bought into it, hook line and sinker. Adam needs to look at it from the other side of the coin and understand this as well. It's not only Russia discovering the Sun cooling down but other scientists as well in our country and every where else knows that the hot temperatures of the Sun have gone down. Just look it up and you'll understand what I'm talking about.	UCA5jD7V9PEMrzCVpZiOzvRw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCA5jD7V9PEMrzCVpZiOzvRw	1	UggAVt4YyZUraXgCoAEC	J W

Our companies and even our politicians (democrats and republicans) need to stop thinking of their wallets and start thinking about the big picture. Look at solar the reasons that we don&#39;t have panels on hour homes is that the government can&#39;t make money off of it so they restrict what the solar panel companies can do and they drive the prices of purchasing them up to where everyday people can&#39;t buy and install them to our homes. If they would just give up on trying to make people pay for it we could bring competition to the solar panel industry which would drive down the prices of panels and we could use them to generate our own free and clean renewable energy and if everyone in the US was running on clean energy we would be taking a huge leadership role in the global fight against climate change and thats where we need to be.

Firstly, yes, Earth's climate naturally fluctuates, but that doesn't mean we aren't accelerating it, or that we shouldn't try to slow it as much as possible. Secondly, water also expands when heated, and it doesn't matter how much ice has expanded if it's on land, like most of the greenland ice sheet, because ice on land isn't displacing any water, so all of the water that melts on it will contribute to sea level rise, whereas ice in water floats, and displaces about it's own weight in water, because that's how floating works, which means it melting will neither raise or lower sea levels. It WILL however no longer reflect sunlight when it's gone, which will accelerate the warming of the oceans, which will then expand, contributing to sea level rise. Thirdly: A Maunder minimum really doesn't have much to do with the issue at hand, does it?

That&#39;s the stupidest &quot;science&quot; I&#39;ve ever heard. We know the Earth has been warming and cooling for thousands of years, but we&#39;re going to blame CO2 emissions for an average temperature increase we&#39;ve only been able to measure for the past 130 years? That&#39;s a very poor scientific conclusion by any standard.<br /><br />The Earth has survived far greater than 2 degree temperature variations in the past, so why are we going batshit crazy over it now? Even if these dire warnings were completely accurate, there&#39;s NO WAY people are going to change their way of life to the extent necessary to alleviate things, which means we need to stop trying to beat people over the head trying to get them to do so, and instead find another solution.

What's there however are meetings with the UN and the distribution of resources to 3rd world nations. It may as well be the Paris Poverty Agreement, you can read the actual document yourself here: https://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2015/cop21/eng/l09r01.pdf	UCl5PUyCFtBcIknAeN9UMJBA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl5PUyCFtBcIknAeN9UMJBA	1	UgiRtNNyaioThHgCoAEC	Skyler Smallman

We the humans are next to take advantage of the earth by extracting the resources the earth is providing, which is fuel. When the time comes, the humans will die off once all the fuel is depleted making room for the next organisms. Earth will once again recycle everything to accommodate the new organisms and continues on. Everything has an expiration date that we can&#39;t see but it&#39;s there. The earth imo is like a restaurant where it serves the customers by providing them with meals and once they&#39;re done eating, you gotta leave and the table is cleared for the next group of customers. Earth will die off too but not anytime soon. <br /><br />All the things we use came from the earth, (metal, wood, rubber, oil etc.) it&#39;s just that it&#39;s chemically altered for us to use. ppl think we&#39;re killing earth but we&#39;re not doing nowhere near the damage the dinosaurs have done when they were alive. imagine how much vegetation were eaten by those giant creatures each day, or how much methane gases were coming out of those giant monstrosities each day into the air? (cows alone are polluting the air just as much as humans are with their methane gases) This is the era for humans to exist and soon we will be gone just like the dinosaurs so don&#39;t feel guilty just cuz you forgot to recycle your Pepsi can cuz you&#39;re not destroying the earth, you&#39;re just making a mess that&#39;s all xD	UCHTa5Zq4NK-WyeYY64iihRA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHTa5Zq4NK-WyeYY64iihRA	0

They don&#39;t practice what they preach so it makes it difficult to take the issue seriously. Also, not a single IPCC Model has come to fruition or proven a correlation with CO2 to global rise in temperatures. Don&#39;t forget email gate. The 97% consensus is bogus, created by John Cook, a cartoonist. Logically, the only way 97% could have been obtained is by surveying 100% of all scientist, which never happened. CO2 is not a poison but a plant fertilizer. Current global average is 400 ppm. Greenhouse plants flourish better with 1,500 ppm CO2, and sailors on submarines do well with 8,000 ppm for up to 3 months with no issue. Scientists studying Climate Change (especially anthropogenic) depend on government grants and other sources of funding tp promulgate this which is beginning to look more and more like a myth or religion. I&#39;m not going to change my lifestyle or endure arbitrary regulations based purely on a theory. Follow the money. Do the research. Don&#39;t be a sheep.

So, it&#39;s pretty clear that fossil fuels should not be the main nor the only society focus to help the planet. If you are wondering how is it possible that cows are a greatest concern then fossil fuels. Well, the answer is methane which is a gas estimated to be 30 times more potent than CO2. (source : <a href="https://blogs.princeton.edu/research/2014/03/26/a-more-potent-greenhouse-gas-than-co2-methane-emissions-will-leap-as-earth-warms-nature/">https://blogs.princeton.edu/research/2014/03/26/a-more-potent-greenhouse-gas-than-co2-methane-emissions-will-leap-as-earth-warms-nature/</a>)<br /><br />So, in case you want to do something to help the environnement, just switch to a plant-based diet. Nope, that&#39;s not a vegan diet, I only said PLANT-BASED. Consult the book «The whole foods diet» by John Mackley, Alona Pulde (M.D) and Matthew Lederman (M.D).

WTF? <br /><br />Yes the &#39;Global Annual Mean Temperature&#39; is rising but it not rising for the reasons we are being told it is. There is a huge when and where factor in play no one want s to discuss. <br />Namely the vast majority of the statistical aggregate that makes the GAMT number rise is coming from shorter winter seasons. Not hotter summers. Just longer ones with longer Spring and Fall seasons.

Nobody knows why it does this but they are ignoring the fact that companies like Tesla pay media outlets (Adam Ruins Everything) to say that cars pollute and whatnot; heck, if we were to read the news in the 1990&#39;s we should be underwater right now.

There's just no talking to stupid. Global warming is real, resulting in worsening situations. It's demonstrable by the melting permafrost and glaciers. The only real debate is how much is caused by us, and how much is caused by the earths natural cycle. In any event, why even throw more fuel on the fire? In the end, those two nutjobs claimed it was a ruse to redistribute money from the rich nations to the third world. All the while not issuing any evidence to bolster their argument. They just prefer to stick to their paranoid conspiracy theory.	UC-ohPyJwKcYEpkbaseWD2Ow	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-ohPyJwKcYEpkbaseWD2Ow	1	UgggchQG-kuyGngCoAEC	Global Critics

They disagree that humans made a significant mark on what our planet does naturally. Plus during Al Gore's huge push for global warming, tons of facts were construed, causing people to doubt the real science. Those doubts became engrained in their minds, and skewed what they read now. All humans do it. It's called bias, or stereotyping. Plus a lot of the "heads" of the global warming movement are complete hypocrites. Keeping with my Al Gore bash: there are photos of him with his private jet, diesel truck and his several constantly lit houses. So in short: skewed data, lies, hypocrites, and bias and another obvious factor, industry.

Also, there is actually no real consensus about global warming even in the scientific community as some believe that it is a natural process, some believe that it is not catastrophic, and some believe that natural forces such as the boom of plant life in warmer climates or increase of clouds will stop it. I personally believe in it but think that the free market can solve it as solar panels are projected to become cheaper than fossil fuels per kilowatt/hour by 2020 and nuclear power is also emission free and cheaper than fossil fuels. Also, Adam is completely wrong that humans can't adapt to this as we have adapted to worse climate change such as the little ice age	UC4umSNVJRqs7yzZWVq6VhhA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4umSNVJRqs7yzZWVq6VhhA	1	UgggchQG-kuyGngCoAEC	Global Critics

Stricter gun laws won't kill all life on the planet, denying that global warming exists will kill in the long run all life on the planet. Clinging to your political believes and hypocritical conservative standards won't secure the future of humanity. To both sides...Grow yourself a spine and work together. Struggling over power that has no meaning if the end is near. You can butcher yourselves afterwards as much as you want, I just don't want cats to go extinct.

Humanity will adapt as it always has and things like science and the Internet will not disappear but it will still be bad. People will move to safer places or will build things to protect themselves as it becomes a bigger issue however there will be floods, droughts and climates will change. We may very well be looking at an event that kills billions of people and there is little we can do to stop it, all we can do is try to be prepared for it and to push it as far back as possible, but it is coming.

It's not like the earth is hotter than it ever has been, or it's not like the earth can't get as hot as it has. Climate change is happening all the time, with or without us, we just speed it up.

Ugg7-yYot02sC3gCoAEC	1	1	2016-12-31 16:27:20	Alex Schmidt	Get ready for a brand new episode of Alex ruins everything. The earth is warming at a rate that is consistent with what it has been doing since the last ice age long before cars and oil. And unfortunately for this videos integrity the oceans aren&#39;t rising. And rather then just site a source that says that I will go the long complicated way about it so you completely understand. So first let&#39;s talk about the Arctic and I&#39;ll move fast because I don&#39;t want to spend all day typing this comment that nobody will read anyway. The Arctic is basically a sheet of floating ice, or an ice cube in a glass of water. Now using the most basic high school physics you will know that ice displaces water. This means that even if the Arctic melted 100% it would not raise sea levels at all, and your cup of water will not overflow. Now move across the globe to the Antarctic and this is a completely different story. The Antarctic is land mass covered in ice. If this were to melt the oceans would rise a massive degree. But even NASA, who has been sued for fabricating AGW papers and withholding raw data, even they admit that the Antarctic is growing by 82 billion tons of ice per year. Now we&#39;re left with Greenland, but in reality green land wouldn&#39;t make enough difference to even care about so in the interest of my time I&#39;m moving on. Let&#39;s now talk about the effects that CO2 has on the climate that I noticed the video didn&#39;t cover, also I may be mistaken but was one of there sources the Rolling Stones? Anyway if you looked for your information at the IPCC for example you would see that they say you&#39;ll get 6 degree F warming per doubling of CO2. However the IPCC is not a proper peer reviewed source. If you look at peer reviewed scientific studies you&#39;ll find that in almost every paper you look at you will see that they say you&#39;ll only get a 1-1.5 degrees F warming per doubling of CO2. This makes a massive difference and basically means that at the rate we&#39;re going we have nothing to worry about. Now I just want to touch on a couple more things then I&#39;m out. First of the 97% of scientists agree on global warming is a myth and here&#39;s why, first off science isn&#39;t done by consensus and anyone who says it has no idea how the scientific method works. That aside however they got that number from the amount of scientists who agree that CO2 has an effect on the earths temperature which obviously it does but as I stated above not enough to at this rate make any noticeable difference and any difference it did make at that degree would be for most places positive. <b>insert cute baby in stroller here so that your emotions will make you want to believe me</b> and fade out.

Also, consensus is very important in science. It shows that something is widely accepted. 97% of scientists showing climate change is real means that the scientific community generally thinks its happening. Even a few degrees is something to worry about.	UCEUGY1DU6kIg3Q4jldudlfw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEUGY1DU6kIg3Q4jldudlfw	1	Ugg7-yYot02sC3gCoAEC	Alex Schmidt

We do need to stop burning fossil fuels though due to the air quality. <br /><br /> If you look at the temperature of the sun (you know, the thing that produces all that heat) the temperature spikes at the exact same rate that the earths temperature spikes. So we&#39;re blaming the air pollution, but really the pollution is barely even contributing to the temperature. It&#39;s just a solar flare from the sun that we have no control over.<br /><br /> Of course all that pollution is still destroying the planet.

We&#39;re currently building up in temperature before our next big freeze aka ice age. That&#39;s the process involved. starting during a ice age you have the cool period and this would last typically around 10,000 years after that the temperature would start to rise slowly and that has been whats occurring for the past etc. years and now at our point in time the temperature is quickly rising before going into the next ice age. The reason it&#39;s seen as a huge difference is because the last humans that existed in an ice age were your typical homo-genus like Neanderthals. So as such we have not experienced such drastically different weather. So really Global Warming isn&#39;t an argument based on &quot;We&#39;re Killing The Planet!&quot; and its more based on &quot;We Want Everything To Stay The Same!&quot; and while yes our burning of fossil fuels is speeding it up it isn&#39;t speeding it up by a large margin, maybe by 1000 - 2000 years and if the typical &quot;Interglacial Period&quot; which is what we are currently in lasts for around 15,000 - 20,000 that&#39;s at the largest effect only a 13% speed up, which is tiny.

That includes abandoning cities, getting rid of phones, electricity, cars, excessively large houses, businesses, taxes, money, modern medicine you name it and return to hunter/gather society with tribes of only a few hundred people. It would be important to minimize farming to avoid over population, laziness, and unnatural psychological disorders from developing again (you don&#39;t have time to be a depressed hoarder or you will die from starvation). Go back to the ways of following regional weather and animal migration patterns to avoid burning up too many resources in one place. You will have to re learn the knowledge our ancestors once had with medicinal plants and pass that down. Ok so on and on this is what I imagine is the only way. Considering the countless amounts of people who don&#39;t even know how to start a fire let alone cook nothing more than top ramen for themselves I think it is safe to say that it will never happen. We can and should take steps to avoid it, absolutely. But again if this is all true, essentially everything has to go. We cannot sit here on our computers that were shipped from around the world on massive cargo ships, along with our clothing, along with our dishes, tvs, etc. And point the finger that other people are not doing their part to help. Radical change is the ONLY way to avoid this.	UC55feYSP6sAx5kg9FRbd2Wg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC55feYSP6sAx5kg9FRbd2Wg	0

An easy example: If you have a room temperature and a ventilator and you put the speed of the ventilator in regards to the temperature you will see a clear correlation. However if you for example put a heater in the room then the actions of this heater might make it seem that there is no correlation between the temperature and the ventilator speed. However there is a correlation, but there are also correlations between the temperature and other factors which when not taken into account can completely distort the graph and wouldn't show the actual correlation. By not even showing these other factors on this graph we can't take assumptions on a correlation by anything else than looking at action-reaction (splitting the graph up in several parts). when looking at co2 and temperature you only put those two in the graph, yes. But if want to draw conclusions out of it about correlations you also need to use other information, be it other graphs or other data about the other factors that might have an influence on one of the two original variables. This is exactly what makes this kind of research not easy and that's why need to have an education on the topic and need to do years of research or fully read the studies of people that have done these studies and not just look at one graph that might be pulled out of context. yes, over time people proposed an alternative to the commonly believed theory/knowledge, however they needed to either disprove the commonly believed knowledge or proof the new knowledge, the community would then check these findings and if correct it would change their view. However there are many more instances where the larger community had it right and the smaller wrong. Now the flat earth is a non-argument. Most scientist and educated people have known about the earth being round and accepted it after seeing the evidence for a long time, because the evidence supported that theory. That the earth was round is something that people found out and spread through the scientific/philosofic community, while it were unedicated people who kept believing the earth was flat because they didn't know better. Global warming is something that is being researched extensively and so far the smaller group of non-global warming scientist hasn't been able to show evidence that can convince the community that their analyses/theories are wrong, while the the other scientists find more evidence that support the common theory. can I ask what education you have followed	UCgoiTlk0_El7Za8zaL-ZJ6A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgoiTlk0_El7Za8zaL-ZJ6A	1	UgiI3_GvbNF-93gCoAEC	The One Golden Gryphon

We have been around for very little time compared to the 4.5 billion years that the earth has been around. If you think that CO2 strongly impacts temperature then in a graph with CO2 and temperature you should find that they follow each other. However, when looking at the graph, you can clearly see that they do not follow each other. If you only look at parts of it (like you did) you are ignoring the reality which is while between certain time fraims you see that they do follow each other, as a whole, they do not. Also, my graph is not incomplete. When looking for a correlation between CO2 and temp, what do you look at? Obviously CO2 and temp. If you want to find the drivers of heat then yes you wouldn't just look at CO2 and temp. Also since when does the fact that many more scientists believe what you say is true mean anything? Need I remind you of the times in the past when an overall agreement in the scientific community was disproven not by the majority, but by the minority? For example, most people believed the earth was flat until a few people said that they were wrong. Consencus has no meaning in the world. Just because everyone thinks it's right doesn't mean it is.

Now in this case the correlation isn't really unjust, the graph is just incomplete (it doesn't account for other gasses like methane, n2o, ... which are far worse than co2, see this link https://climatechangeconnection.org/emissions/co2-equivalents/ ). This is just one graph and the connection between co2 and temperature is already scientifically proven, so show me studies that say co2 levels and temperature are not linked. This graph btw seems outdated and not entirely trustworthy. At this moment we are already at around 400 ppm, while the graph puts us between 200 and 300 ppm. There are numerous more graphs that show a clear correlation between co2 and T and yet you pick the one that is over 17 years old (at least). There has since then been massive research. It's also difficult to work with such a graph to show our situation. We are talking in this graph of co2 levels rising and descending over millions of years, while now we are seeing a similar rise in 100-200 years.

At a time selectively picking which time periods to look at. However if you look at it as a whole you see it doesn’t line up. Look at 439 in the Paleozoic period. You find temperatures relatively similar to today and insane levels of co2. Then look at 409 during the Paleozoic. Extremely high temps and what.... lower co2 levels. There are other factors that go into the weather. Perhaps we should be more concerned with the sun.

UgiI3_GvbNF-93gCoAEC.8N7d2odlGoz8eKXGeBt8O2		0	2018-03-28 08:11:19	Archangel17	Besides co2 there are many many other factors that also contribute to temperature change. in fact some quite common gasses (like methane) are 25 times worse than co2 and some others even several times more. This graph is just to simplistic to really make any link or not between co2 and temperature.There is a bit of correlation between it and you said there is non at all, based solely on one graph that even shows some correlation (you can't have large correlation seeing it's one of many factors). Yes it could take millions of years, seeing the difference is not that really large from the graph: -triassic = 210 ppm -cretaceous= 340 ppm 1950 = +-300 ppm now = 400 ppm the difference in 60-70 years for us is what normally takes millions of years to naturally occur. also you're completely missing the point of the correlation, it's not that highest co2 levels need to correspond with highest temperature levels, you need to look at what happens. When co2 levels rise the temperature generally also rises, while when the co2 levels are stagnant so does the temperature. The same thing for when it lowers. If you look at that you clearly see a correlation. Perhaps not always but enough to suggest a correlation, ofcourse people don't just go decide there is a clear correlation based on one graph that doesn't even show other factor (it might already make a big difference if you graph co2 equivalent instead of just co2. One can contribute the temperature not always following co2 levels to other factors not showed on this graph.

It does in some places but just moving it to the right does not work. It that was true then explain to me why the Eocene thermal maximum (when the earth was hottest) would have to line up with the highest co2 levels. Over 300 million years earlier. So yeah. The simple solution is that it takes hundreds of millions of years to take affect. I don’t think so. Things just don’t take that long to go into affect.

Besides the graph the science clearly shows the impact of co2 on temperature. Also 30 years is nothing, you might have some short fluctuations, but you need to look at the larger picture, and this shows that despite these 30 years cooling down, the overall temperature has gone up considerably over a much larger timeperiod.

I can’t think of the other sides responses to what I say because people think differently. I’m just trying to say this point. Yes the earth is warming. Is it man made or not, that is heavily debated and I don’t have a PhD so there’s that. What I do know is that if we do have a impact then it is very minuscule. For example here in America we canceled the Paris peace climate agreement. The best case scenario would be to decrease each countries carbon emissions by 32%. Say we do reach this improbable number. What would the effects be.  A positive impact would be it would further our focus towards other sources of energy it because of the climate but because it’s running out. It would also decrease global co2 emissions (if that had an effect) by less than one percent and decrease global temperatures by .002 degrees by 2100.(Institute for energy reaserch). Minuscule but still a change.  The bad is This clean power plan has lost Americans almost 130,000 jobs in the coal industry.  Based on the EPA’s figures if we continued on that track we would loose 48% of jobs in the coal industry. This also drove up energy costs.  The national Economic Research Associates concluded that the bill had an economic cost of 25.6 billion per year.  By 2030 the cost of this plan would have been drastic. There would be an average  employment shrift by 300,000 jobs. A peak employment shortfall over 1 million. A loss of more than 2.5 trillion in GDP and the average person would loose 7,000 per year.(the heritage foundation).  I think that there is not enough that we could do to be effective at this point.  I am very glad that this has been a productive (yet sometimes heated) conversation.  And I hate auto correct as well.

A link http://theclimateblog.livejournal.com/4301.html (because I'm lazy) 4. The thriving of plants after the dinosaurs extinction caused a decrease in carbon dioxide levels and greatly increased oxygen in the atmosphere, but we humans are burning that ancient matter back into the atmosphere 5. The participation of humans harming nature, for example deforestation, participates in global warming by killing off the things that take carbon out of the atmosphere and "put out" oxygen 6.

Hmmmm.  Maybe it could be the 18 billion dollars in funding.  Why would we pump them more money if they said everything is okay.  That's the same reason they keep saying there could be life on mars when it has been proven decades ago that there atmosphere cannot support life.  Next maybe we should see if they were ever to change numbers in the past.  Surely since we can't trust a sight we haven't heard before we must trust the worldwide known "holy" nasa.  Well they've been changing numbers since the 1980's.  First they said the earth cooled .2 degrees celsius from 1921-1979.  But by 1999, NASA had changed the 1921 to 1979 cooling which Tom Karl reported into almost 0.3C warming, and had erased most of the 1940 to 1970 cooling.  By 2001, NASA had increased the fake 1921 to 1979 warming to more than 0.3C, had further erased the 1940 to 1970 cooling, and showed about 0.5C warming from 1880 to 1999.  NASA now shows 0.5C warming from 1921 to 1979, have completely erased the 1940 to 1970 cooling, and show 1.1C warming from 1880 to 1999. They more than doubled 1880 to 1999 warming since their 2001 graph.  This image overlays the 2016 NASA graph on top of  Hansen’s 1981 NASA graph, at the same scale on both axes. It shows how NASA has cooled the past far outside their own blue error bars. This indicates that they do not understand their own data and are not doing science. https://realclimatescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/2016-08-23100722-2.gif Now about how credible that graph is.  That is just one.  I chose that one because it looked the best and is only the image from a page.  Here is a link to the full page.  By the way this comes from Dr. Vincent Gray a chemist based in New Zealand. He is a retired coal industry researcher, climate author, and founder of the New Zealand Climate Science Coalition https://wattsupwiththat.com/2013/06/04/dr-vincent-gray-on-historical-carbon-dioxide-levels/	UCmKOycfh1dt7V_sSyfTQ_4Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmKOycfh1dt7V_sSyfTQ_4Q	1	UgiI3_GvbNF-93gCoAEC	The One Golden Gryphon

We got a lot of snow that we missed a whole week of school. Back then we were lucky if we got 2-3 days off of school from snow. Plus now in (2016) it is supposed to be cold (which I like that it is hot but not normal) but instead it&#39;s like spring and during autumn it was like a mixed of summer and spring because some days were hot and others were just fine but it was supposed to be cold (which I will not lie I never liked it) but my point is that, this is a Big Problem. <br /><br />Sorry for any mistakes and punctuation mistakes	UCPnohxuHh0X4K2ag12Kk1KA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPnohxuHh0X4K2ag12Kk1KA	0

When the trees take in the carbon it doesn't just disappear it is just stored, and as soon as a tree dies the carbon is released back into the atmosphere. This only slows down global warming and this may not sound like such a bad idea except the number of trees needed to do that would affect the amount of sunlight that bounces off the earth potentially heating up the earth even more.

They strip all the minerals and bacteria from the water and put minerals back in to give the water a taste. This cleaning process is good, but it does cost us our B12. The only reason you get B12 from animals is because they drink unclean water that has B12 in it. I don’t feel like I should filter my nutrients through another animal. I can take a B12 pill once in a blue moon and it’s no big deal. Why I don’t eat meat? It’s an industry that’s destroying the environment, releasing, I believe the number was 15% of green house gas emissions on the planet. This percentage is more than all the worlds transportation combined. There are documentaries like Cowspiracy that talk more in-depth about the matter if you’d like to learn more.

Then again, it was established that the carcinogenic potential was highly dependent on how often those kind of meats were consumed, and to be fair "respectable" is a measure of humans beyond the physical, and anthropomorphizing animals is IMO pretty pointless. So I don't know what the point of the video would be, try to convince vegan diets are the way to go? The WHO still contemplates red meat as part of a balanced diet, and vegans have to make up for the nutrients they don't get from animals in one way or another, which brings us back to "why not just eat some meat?".

The fact of the matter is that the data we have is showing rapidly increasing temperatures that corresponds directly with greenhouse gas emissions since the beginning of the industrial revolution. We also understand exactly how it works. It's just physics and there have been scores of researchers who've been able to accurately forecast the increases using models based on our emissions. Clearly our temperatures are increasing and the major disagreement is why. Given two the facts I've mentioned above it seems pretty clear that the evidence is that the temperature would not be occurring without human-caused emissions.

We are doomed if we don&#39;t turn around. The scientists don&#39;t know if we already are at a point of no return, because we have put too much CO2 and methane, and other greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere and cut down too much forest.

That is true but only for small houses ie farm house, trailer homes, shacks, cottages, and one-story buildings. Also the sun is not always out, so unless it is out all the time or we can collect enough electricity. It's not worth it. But what We should do is keep on researching for better solar panels. Or you know we can just plant more trees everywhere. But the government should not force people to do so and or do it themselves, because that never works IE the airplane, train, telegraph, fur trade, etc.	UCbyKqbhSYOsjddgtq2AcDGw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbyKqbhSYOsjddgtq2AcDGw	1	Ugi96q3pxPUaWXgCoAEC	Per Ringnes

Oh I know coal, oil, gas, nuclear, etc. And the cars don't burn coal but the power plants do. Also mining lithium is not a clean activity. And also do you know how much land wind and solar farms take up? A lot of land more than 5 acre to power a few houses. PS THE SUN IS NOT ALWAYS OUT, AND THE WIND DOESN'T BLOW ALL THE TIME. But want to know what does work all the time? COAL, OIL, GAS, ETC. And I think you want forests so why want solar/wind farms? The things that take up so much land.

Tesla cars use Lithium-Ion batteries. The Gigafactories and Panasonic's factories that produce those batteries draw some power from the main grid and oil and coal burning provide the main grid with energy, but that's far from being on Elon Musk. That's on the government standard. Besides, Elon Musk has been skillfully employing the use of solar farms to generate energy, so you can take your blatant lies and bad reasoning and shove it. Get your facts straight.	UCHDlfSa4AZBi0O45cfQHxEg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHDlfSa4AZBi0O45cfQHxEg	1	Ugi96q3pxPUaWXgCoAEC	Per Ringnes

Explain that. How have so many people fell for it, even scientists, but it is still not real. Explain why 2017 is the hottest year ever. I am really tired of all the people who are to lazy to actually do something about it, so instead when asked about it, saying that they don't believe in it,just so that they can getaway with being lazy. And some people this idea just gets passed down from generation to generation. Just take a look at the 300 websites that say climate change is real. The rest of the websites that say climate change isn't real are all conspiracy theory websites with no real scientist backing.

That's why when we see even a 0.2 change in the pH levels, it's a BIG deal. As I tried to explain before, thought it might have been in a different comment thread, that it's like adding a teaspoon of salt to a pool vs adding over 5 gallons of salt to the same pool. Yes, in the 1st example you would be able to detect the salt in the pool. but because of how vast the pool is, the salt wouldn't make much difference. But add over 5 gallons of salt to the same pool, and now there is a taste difference. For a long time we were slowly adding just 1 teaspoon of salt to our pool, but now we are adding gallons of salt to our pools. An analogy that, hopefully fits the situation and explains it. Now, as to the global cooling, that was not a majority or even a fraction of scientists. About 30 papers (if i recall correctly that is, which I doubt, there is so many numbers to keep track of) came out saying global cooling was going to happen. In that same time frame over 4000 papers came out saying global warming was going to happen. The media picked up these papers that said that global cooling was going to happen and reported it as if that was what all scientists said. That just wasn't true. Now, as you do research into climate change, you will notice that we changed from the term "global warming" to "climate change". Not because we suddenly learned the planet was not warming, but because we learned that as the planet warmed up, the whole climate of the planet was going to shift. Places that used to get lots of rain will be desserts, and places that used to be desserts will get lots of rain. Of course this will take decades to happen, as the planet does need to take time to shift, but these changes are happening faster because of how quick our CO2 levels have risen. A lot of times you will see conservatives like to make connections to things, and say "ahhh, but this caused X and Y", and they have the right idea, sadly they don't get it right most of the time, and statistics show that. Now, if they argued saying "but it's not as good as Bob said it would be" then I would have to agree. A lot of times people on the left DO put things out of proportion, as you stated. Sadly, as you do more research into climate change, A LOT of the things that the left is saying is not being put that far out of proportion. Think of it in terms of that pool again. If we have a pump in that pool that can remove 5 teaspoons of salt a year, and we were putting 5 teaspoons of salt in the pool a year, we would have a balance. But put 5.1 teaspoons in, and that pump won't get all the salt out. Over the years that extra teaspoon of salt will build up. Now, imagine that over time that pump is getting worn out. We used to replace the pump every 2 years, but lately we have been replacing it every 5 years, and getting longer each time. That is us destroying our carbon sinks, like our trees. So, as we burn more of our coal, we are cutting down more forests. Making it so more CO2 is put into the air while at the same time destroying the Earths ability to take in the CO2 and turn it to oxygen. Then the same thing is going for our oceans. We are turning the oceans more acidic which is gonna kill the oceans ability to absorb more CO2, making the atmosphere have more CO2, which then will continue to make our planet warmer. As for the lies, cheats, and stealing. What would you do if you knew that the fate of mankind rested on getting the planet to stay a certain way, but no one believed you? That is the exact problem the left is facing right now. The science shows us that the fate of mankind rests on us doing something about this issue, yet about 50% of the nation doesn't think so. Now, true, it won't happen in our lifetimes, and maybe not even our kids lifetimes. But why should future generations deal with an issue that we can stop today? We may not have all the technology needed right now, but if we put our money where our mouths are, we could have that tech quick enough to save at least some of mankind. I don't agree with the lieing, cheating, stealing ways, but I do understand the desire to do so because it is having compassion for our fellow humans. Understanding that if we do nothing now, our fellow humans in the future will suffer. Now, as to something you mentioned, the ozone. Did you know that we actually DID fix the hole in the ozone. It took the entire planet, all countries, working together to ban the aerosols and things that was damaging it. So, that issue was fixed, thanks to the help of the whole world. Why can't we get together like we did for that issue? The left is very controlling because it's what is called "Rational Politics". If you don't make rules/laws based on it, things won't get better. See, just like with the ozone situation. There is others as well, like with drugs. Now whats funny is that drugs, it was the Conservatives who BAN them, while the Liberals who want to restrict them. See, no one is going to stop doing drugs, and making it illegal is just going to drive it underground. Whereas if you restrict it, yes it will have parts go underground, but mostly it will stay restricted. Look at guns as another example. Japan and China don't have BANS on guns, they have RESTRICTIONS on guns. Much tougher ones than the US. And they have far less deaths from guns than we do. Places that have BANS on guns actually have more deaths from guns. Pay attention to what the left is saying. You will notice they, at least mostly, don't want to ban guns, they want bigger restrictions. Like Germany as well. See, things are more complex than people like to think, and sadly, that is what is destroying our ability to fix these issues.

The oceans are unimaginably VAST. they contain unimaginable volumes of water. Their capacity to absorb CO2 from the atmosphere without significant increases in acidity are also immense. The leftists are constantly sounding the alarms about some new, phantom looming disaster, acid rain, ozone holes, first global cooling, then global warming, then "climate change", spotted owls, snail darters, polar bears, ect, ect, ect, ect..... Their list of "doom and disaster issues" is almost as vast as the above mentioned ocean. Most or all of them supposedly are about to spell the end of life on Earth And we're always on the brink, or point of no return with every subject, all the time. Just one more degree, one more percent, or ppm, or month/year/decade, or what ever other unit of measure, and thats it. The end of everything has began. And over time, almost all of them have turned out to be grossly over exagerated, or just completely untrue. The most aggressive leftists will stop at nothing to get their way on such issues. Lie, cheat, steal, kill. Whatever it takes... What they don't want to ban, they want to make mandatory. They are control freaks. They want to be the ones who oversee and control your every action, word, and thought, and be the punishers of those who don't conform exactly to their point of view. Of course, not all leftist are this hardcore, but many are. You seem to be a fairly reasonable person, and I'll presume you to be of the latter. Have humans done some some harmful things to the Earth, Sure. And we have corrected, or are in the process of correcting many of them. Others still need to addressed, but the leftists always want radical, outrageously expensive "solutions" that demand people give up lots of money and freedoms. The issue (climate change) is just a means to achieve their real goal, to take your wealth, and control you. BTW, I'm glad to hear that you don't do drugs. Sure, plenty of "smart" people use them too. But if they are so smart, why are they doing this stuff? And rest assured, that for every "smart" person doing drugs, there are many more dumb people doing them...

As I said, a PART, which means there is MANY other parts of it, and the people need to learn what those parts are. And no, I don't have that in my system, I prefer to keep my system clean of most things that are drug related.

What is life? If you asked what is the meaning of life, it's a difficult question, but the answer is simple, the meaning of life is what meaning you place to it. As to how you worded it, what is life, again, a difficult question, and one that cannot as easily be answered. I would say life is when something reacts to the environment in a way that allows them to procreate better, and pass on traits. So, flowers would fall under that, so would humans, dogs, cats, etc. I don't know if philosophers word it like that, but philosophy is a great place to look for a definition of life. A merging of philosophy and science that is.	UCwT0MG7TBQpn62_tAUDbMMQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwT0MG7TBQpn62_tAUDbMMQ	1	UggSFCr1DMj5r3gCoAEC	Elijah Davila

It's kinda like, if someone had their car catch on fire, and were all upset at it. Technically their cars temperature has gotten pretty hot, but not that fast or that intense. That is what we are doing to the planet now. The problem is that ALL our systems are built around the planet having a stable CO2 level around 300 ppm. Now we have that stable thing become not so stable. It will throw EVERYTHING that we humans have built out the window. Since humans now number in the billions, we can't evolve to deal with this issue. And the speed at which it is happening is not gonna/is not giving animals the time needed to adapt to these massive changes. Basically, if we continue on this path, we will see an extinction of life on this planet like none seen before. We humans will also see MASSIVE deaths. Destabilization of our economies and other systems will cause massive riots and migrations. Which will further our own demise. And, an argument that can be put to that is that it may not be for another 100 to 200 years. Yeah, sure, I will give it that. But think about it, do you want to contribute to the massive issues that our children will have to deal with? Just like in a song by VNV Nation, called Testament (great song, i suggest you listen to the whole album, called Judgement, but i digress)"Let tomorrow deal with what we could have done". As to your 1st question of what is the normal temperature, well, think of it this way, about 200 years ago we had temperatures that ALL of human history was built on. Then, when the industrial revolution happened we started to change that. And what's really sad is that the people who did the least to make this happen, are being affected the most right now. Your entitled to your opinion as you call it, but, if you really look at it, it's facts, science, reality. Reality doesn't care how we feel, and will continue on, with or without us. And, as a human, I want to see humans continue to live, not die off. Your comment, while is somewhat logical, basically is saying that you don't care if humans die off. At times, I do feel like humans need to die off. Our evolution has made us super conservative, and that has made us VERY limited in our abilities to do things. At the rate we are becoming more conservative, we will never make it to other planets. Or if we do, it will be short lived. But, even so, do ALL humans deserve to die off just because we evolved to be dumb? I don't see any evidence to suggest so. There is a TON of good things humans do, for each other, for the planet, etc. It's those good things that make me see that humans are worth saving. I want to see us get off this planet, become a type 1 civilization, maybe even a type 2. But at the rate the people deny climate change, we won't last through it. At the VERY LEAST we need to rethink where our farms will be, and rethink where our cities will be located. Coastal cities will be destroyed. We need to start moving people to higher ground if we are to save as many people as we can. It's about being a human, a fellow human, and recognizing, that even though MANY of them are jerks, or are looking out for themselves only, that is just how we humans evolved, and is not meant to be taken personally. If I was in need of saving in some way, I would have to rely on my fellow humans to realize that I need help, even if I don't think I need it. And to explain it to me. Your comment is basically saying, screw other humans, I will live as I want to live, and if it kills thousands of others, thats fine, I got what I needed. Is that how you want future generations to remember your kind? Your generation? (I don't know what generation you are). I want to part of the group that recognized an issue, didn't put it off to the side, and actually dealt with the consequences now, rather than leave worse consequences for my children to deal with. I want my legacy, even if it is lost the the annuls of time, to be that I was a good human to my fellow humans, no matter how much it was viewed at the time as "crazy", or "fruitless". I have seen the science of climate change, and, the science itself is good, the effects of what we are doing are horrible.

Then we had an asteroid supposedly hit the planet wiping them out. Then we have this fluctuating ice age no ice age period mammals evolved in. I just find it that humans are so concerned with this green planet stuff but we evolved because the "giant organism" evolution path failed. Perhaps what I am sayin is that dinos had more then a hundred million years of evolution in a period where life just grew larger to compete with each other. Perhaps humans evolved because of this unstable climate. When we have a written history only a few thousand years and its full of the tales of floods, plagues and all that have become the wrath of angry god. When we have hurricanes and typhoons wiping out cities. One thinks what will the fish do when their ocean is a bit more acidic? We are a living organism that has changed the world even before the industrialization of our society, we bred crops and beasts into things they are no longer like, deforested areas, hunted down species to extinction. Conservation is great in my opinion but in my opinion is that we have already changed the world we should just accept that, the legacy of humans will be its waste.

UggSFCr1DMj5r3gCoAEC.8N3smxJo5_V8NCow8ZMs2L		34	2017-01-01 22:55:24	Aleric Johansen	Correct, Calcium Carbonate is also the VERY same thing that TONS of the life in the ocean uses for their shells. There is also a HUGE abundance of water in the ocean (kinda a duh there I know). The item that is missing is the CO2. However, we humans are burning fossil fuels, which puts more CO2 into the air. Which then the ocean absorbs. In fact, a majority of the CO2 that we put into the air is absorbed into the oceans. When that reaction happens, it takes away the stuff that the creatures use for their shells, but ALSO turns the ocean more acidic. Since the stuff the creatures of the ocean uses is very sensitive to the pH levels, it actually eats away at their shells as it becomes more acidic. Thus, ocean acidification happens. Now, this is only 1 Piece of the climate change stuff. Oceans are VAST things. Imagine a pool in your backyard. If you add only a teaspoon of salt to that pool, it will raise the saltiness of the pool, but it will be virtually undetectable. That's what the environment does. It does things VERY slow. We humans are adding salt by the gallon to that pool. Even though the pool is HUGE, we are detecting changes in the pool, massive changes. Enough to change the pH levels of the Ocean.

I agree with you on the role of science and importance of skepticism in understanding things. That being said, climate change was not always seen this way nor was it politically charged. I've seen many people forget that 20 years ago, the media was barely acknowledging it, politics had no idea about it. And the narrative didn't just happen overnight. As far as I can remember, people didn't just believed in it over night. The narrative got built year by year - either by scientists making new discoveries, extreme weather events that are more frequent, new highs in temperatures, changing weather patterns, and even cities covered in smog ( paris, hong kong - here it's not only climate change but a variety of other factors). After 20 or so years of building up this narrative, a lot of independent (from eachother) institutions and now after the Paris Climate Change Event - countries, recognise this as a growing concern. True, in the midst of the development of this narrative, some expectations by scientists have not been fulfilled - and those are the ones that deniers hang on when making the argument i.e. Scientists say climate change is real. Scientists say polar bears would dissappear in 20 years. Polar bears didn't dissappear in 20 years, so the science is wrong on climate change. Granted, it might even be a hoax. But it would need to be something that has been building up from being completely denied or unkown to the larger public 20 years ago, to a lot of communities(hundreds) ( institutions and countries ) coming together and dishonestly trying to discredit the fossil fuel industry to further their agenda. I don't know about you but the likelihood of that being true, requires so many variables to work in the same direction, that makes the chances very improbable.

That 5 mil number means absolutely nothing on it's own and you're just throwing it out there to scare people. It's really nothing when we're talking infrastructure, in comparison a single modern nuclear reactor can cost upwards of 10 billion USD. So you can build 2000 wind turbines for one nuclear reactor. If we use the Danish Anholt Offshore Wind Park as a standard for generation it has 111 wind turbines which generate 400 MW. If we built as many as we could given your price for a wind turbine we would get 7.2 GW of power, which is 4 times the power of the entire Olkiluoto Nuclear Power Plant, not just one of it's reactors. If we also count the one under construction then we would still get 2.1 times the power. So no wind turbines are way more efficient and quicker and easier to build.

Also eating less meat and other animal products greatly decreases the demand on the planet for water, land, and food grown and energy used for the billions of animals we consume every year. A plant-based diet is also healthier and more affordable anyway, and a more sustainable food system. Voting at elections for representatives who take seriously the threats posed by climate change. Voting with your wallet with the companies you support, also buying less and buying second-hand also helps. Researchers are designing drought-resistant plants, maybe grow your own tomatoes next season. Tell your political representatives that you prioritize sustainability and action on climate change.

Exempli gratia, the first time in millenia a specie is eqipped with the right tools to save itself from extinction; yet it stands idley by in the corner preoccupying itself with the most trivial things in the selfish endeavour of inaction bolstered by narcissm. The future is in the hands of men who can make a difference today. So I gravely and respectfully ask all men who are capable of such change to act. -Millenial ingrate	UC0KLJ7my1ugazxqLsuIht7w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0KLJ7my1ugazxqLsuIht7w	0

Many species have actually been unearthed holding devices very similar to today's fire arms and cell phones. Findings of such non human tec artifacts from the cretaceous is often encrypted with drawing of other dinosaurs next to some kind of runes, and depicting vehicles made in their image. The latest the project to study the civilization has come has lead to a underground bunker that looks like a abandon hanger. No aircrafts are inside but their is a depiction on the wall showing what looks like a meteor. Of corse you probably have not heard of any of this.

UgiWJTCNkp4DpXgCoAEC.8N02OdPu6Sp8NF0O-o0102		7	2017-01-02 19:22:41	scruffles	Error is inherent in everything scientific, in fact it's one of the first things they teach you to account for. In every experiment or study I've ever done, one of the every first things I do it make a list of all the different variables that could change the data I'm collecting, from human error to issues with the tools that I'm using. The more complicated the experiment, the more things that can go wrong so the more variables you need to account for. However this is why science isn't a one and done thing. When you do an experiment you repeat it several times to see if the results stay consistent or if it was just something that happened in one or two of the tests due to error or something else. This is also why people in the scientific community don't put much stock in things that can't be reproduced. And now we're going to swing it back around to your concern of error in this form of testing and why there's so much confidence in this data. First and foremost the error itself. The data being collected here is all temperature and atmospheric data, which we'd be developing for decades prior to this so while there is still slight error we can assume if the devices are not broken they are fairly accurate. And remember this error goes down the more advance the devices get. Now on top of that there are rarely ever just one of these measurement devices at the collection sites, reading are taken from multiple thermometers and gages to ensure if one is damaged it will be the outlier. The more sites to an area decreases inaccurate data so areas with less collection sites will have less accurate data but that can be off set with regional trends. Past that the only real error that can be accounted for is human error in reporting or recording the data, again though these kind of thing are checked and double checked by more then a dozen people at a time. Like I said error is an inherent obstacle in science and we strive to compensate for it in ever experiment or test we run to the point where it is negligible. All of these are slowly being overcome with technology though so the data we collect to day is vary rarely inaccurate. Lastly you said you're looking at a one or two degrees difference in temperature, where as scientists are looking at changes in temperature in the 0.001 range. This kind of change is a factor of time as much as it is in change of temperature. The warming of the planet of 1 degree is stretched out over nearly a decade but that's still not a good time frame. That same one degree for the last warming cycle wast stretcher out over more then ten times that, allowing for the change to be gradual. But here's the thing, don't just take my word for it. The data for this is out there, the problem is that there are is also a lot of misleading information on both sides. There are people obviously trying to deny that this is happening but there are also the doom sayers who spout "The Day After Tomorrow" as the damning vision of things to come (For reference as a scientist that movie hurt me). The most important thing you can do for anything is look for the facts, not the opinions, the facts. Sorry if that was long winded but i hope that helps you understand the process a bit better.

Since they've been recording though they've taken data points from various sources all around the world, usually points that are already set up like dopplar stations used by weather monitoring services, and used those to create averages for regions over hours-days-weeks (obviously trending more toward hours or even minutes as technology and communication became more advanced) and then expanded that data collection out over the course of a year to get a general trend for that year. Then you compare that with previous years during the same time periods to see if the average temperature in an area is hotter or colder. From there you can extrapolate if global temperature is rising or falling. It's a basic break down of how it is/was performed.

This would mean that, during the average year, the global average temperature would've increased between .0008° and .0014° celsius. In the last 100 years, global average temperatures have increased .7° celsius, averaging .007° per year. Therefore, the global average temperature is increasing at a rate between 5 and 8.75 times faster than it did exiting the ice age. All numbers are found at: https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/GlobalWarming/page3.php and calculations of averages and proportions are done by hand. These results are statistically significant, and would lead to the rejection of the null hypothesis that the global average temperature is changing at a natural rate. This would create a sufficient reason to believe other factors are involved with the increase of global average temperatures. It is primarily believed that the external factor creating this change is human intervention. I invite you to look into peer reviewed papers submitted by climate scientists on the subject. They will do a much better job explaining the science behind it than Adam, Bill Nye, or I would be able to, as none of us are experts in the field of climate science. Lastly, regarding the idea that the numbers are cherry picked, NASA is a reliable and scientific source. Although aeronautics is their intended function, their satellite data and climatology department are among the world leaders in climate science. Thus making their numbers reliable with some degree of confidence.	UCucOoaCjwn2puoIA9I8W05Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCucOoaCjwn2puoIA9I8W05Q	1	Ugi0uGBE3UKDjHgCoAEC	Lawson Take

Here in Canada we have few people, most of the fresh water and lots of natural resources, and climate change will dramatically increase our agricultural yield. Of course there's the massive downside, but why does no one ever discuss the upside of climate change?

He clearly does not have the knowledge, nor the credentials or the basic understanding of Science. FFS he barely knows how to write properly and cites internet articles for people who think they know something cause they read seudoscientific crap websites. Alex just admit you need to go to college or university and just shut up, you don't even know about basic scientific concepts, "your" (it should be you're) an amateur. Listen to the guy, if he says he's a science educator I believe him, he clearly knows what he's talking about. But people with no academic background tend to defend (console) themselves by saying that knowledge not only comes in the form of credentials from universities, but oh my, it would help a lot to properly educate people so they can take informed decisions. I read a couple of articles online , I'm an instant expert, who needs PhD's? Google it and now I know more than the experts. Read scientific papers, not just online articles summarising everything for the masses. Idiocracy is the new rule. The ignorant have overtaken the planet.

Honestly wouldn't it make sense that by the simple nature of the observational bias of an observer to influence reality that chances are general relativity and quantum mechanics are both correct and it depends on if the system is being observed, at the same time no system can be a wave nor a particle, but a duality dependant on how much energy is used to observe it, I'm honestly curious of what you think.

Oh, do I know enough about that guy. He used to be a radio and TV weatherman, and now he's a proponent against "AGW." As is typical of media weathercasters, Watts has no academic training in the physics of climate or related disciplines. Unencumbered by scientific expertise he works by intuition, and intuitively he could not bring himself to accept the documented increase in the U.S. surface temperature record. There "has" to be a problem with instrumentation or book keeping.... Somewhere... Where?... He couldn't tell you.

These are incredibly nit-picky, and many of them are predictions that we've yet to see through. Regardless, are certain individuals being wrong really your weapon to dispute the scientific community, who've never made such claims to begin with? The predictions accepted by the scientific community have either already occurred, are currently occurring, or have yet to occur. Temperature increases, land ice melting, and weather records being broken, or near-broken, in greater frequency are all examples.

There's a reason their positions are not respected by the scientific community, and why you'll find plenty of them with ties to lobbyists and fossil fuel profiteers. If any one of them was actually capable of refuting "AGW." then they would have already received their Nobel Prize for revolutionizing the entire field of Climatology. "About the 97% of scientists agree that AGW is a threat. and science is not done by consensus but being as this is one of peoples main arguments there is no harm in showing them their wrong." Science is not done by consensus, but a scientific consensus does show that the science is done. Not only are 97% of scientists in agreement, but if you count only members of the Scientific Community, that already massive consensus becomes virtually 100%. "i will say that you are correct on a few things like the fact that CO2 causes warming though wrong about how much," The history of climate, not just here, but on virtually any solid planet, revolves around CO2. CO2, whether in excess or in deficit, has been the sole driver of climate change throughout Earth's history. And when the climate changes that drastically, mass extinctions always follow. CO2 is the driver in what maintains the temperature of our planet, the idea that it's somehow less significant than the scientific community is warning is baseless. " i do have the facts on my side" The "facts," are entirely on my side. From temperature data, to CO2 presence, to how CO2 works in the atmosphere, to an overwhelming scientific consensus, I have the facts. You have fringe scientists with no legs to stand on, and... No, that's pretty much it. " Global Warming has become a religion, its like trying to argue to a Christian that god doesn't exist. no matter how many times you use the facts against them they will still insist God exists and Global Warming has become the same." Except, unlike the idea of a god, we can directly observe Global Warming. So your analogy is purely false.

They said "no one ever wants to admit they were wrong." I then read this first sentence to them, and we had a laugh. This gives me hope for humanity. Anyways, on to the rest of the reply. "but the fact is that it doesn't matter at all to what were talking about. i just wanted to see how long you would keep bringing that up instead of the matter at hand." Well, if you go back and read what I originally said, my correction over your use of the word "theory" was a brief aside. It only became a central topic after you continued to argue it. I feel understanding the terms used In science is important for anyone having a discussion over a scientific field. "but you say your a man of science yet you cant read a biology book? but im not on this thread to talk about mental illness." If you're referring to the attempt at a gender analogy, gender is as much a topic of neuroscience and chemistry as it is biology. Your sex is determined by bodily organs, while your gender is determined by your brain and hormones. Normally, a particular brain and set of hormones aligns with a particular body structure, though not always. But yes, this isn't relevant, so we'll move on. "note please don't bring up genders and social issues those are opinion based and if you like men in dresses yelling at you for using the wrong made up gender then that's your opinion" Okay, I know I said I was moving on, but I needed to respond to this one. Genders are not opinions, we can actively observe them. There are two genders, and two sexes, it's also true that they don't always align in the same person. People who make up extra genders are just as ignorant as people who aren't aware people can be born with a female gender and a male sex. Okay, NOW moving on, for real this time. In fact, I'll make the next reply solely about Global Warming and Climate Change, and focus on the comments about only that. Please allow some time after this reply for me to construct the next one.

They aren't. "i refer to it as anthropogenic global warming" "Anthropogenic" isn't typically a necessary conclusion at this point, seeing as anyone who understands how CO2 works in the atmosphere is fully aware that the current warming is anthropogenic. "as in the theory that man is causing the earth to warm at a rate that is unnatural." That's not a theory, it's not an explanatory model, it's an observation. How are you not getting this distinction? "but for example the law of thermodynamics was at one point just a theory until it was absolutely true then became I law." No, it wasn't. I thought I explained this well. In fact, I know I explained this well, you just didn't grasp it. The Laws Of Thermodynamics were always Laws. Physical Laws do not stem from scientific theories, scientific theories are used to explain them. In that sense, Thermodynamics are both a law and theory. "yes in science you can go beyond a theory and that's laws." A theory never becomes a law. In fact, if there was a hierarchy of science, theories would be higher than laws. There is nothing higher, or better, than a theory. Laws describe things, theories explain them. An example will help you to understand this. There's a law of gravity, which is the description of gravity. It basically says that if you let go of something it'll fall. It doesn't say why. Then there's the theory of gravity, which is an attempt to explain why. Actually, Newton's Theory of Gravity did a pretty good job, but Einstein's Theory of Relativity does a better job of explaining it. There explanations are called theories, and will always remain theories. They can't be changed into laws because laws are different things laws describe, and theories explain.

"a theory is exactly that a hypothesis that has not yet been disproven but hasn't been completely confirmed." No, it isn't. A scientific theory is an explanatory model that has met the highest possible standard of substantiation. It is an explanation of an observation (a fact), which holds enough evidence to be actively applied in experiments. It holds predictive quality. "so to say its still a theory means exactly that, its still a theory." Once again. To say "still" before "theories" demonstrates that you don't understand what a scientific theory is, and you just demonstrated it farther by explaining (incorrectly) what you thought a scientific theory was. A scientific theory cannot be "raised up" to anything else, it will ALWAYS be a scientific theory. There is no "higher rank" in the hierarchy of explanatory models. If a model is considered a scientific theory, it has passed the test of substantiation, and that's that. I'll summarize once more: A scientific theory is the highest position an explanatory model can take.

"yes that link helps me" No, it doesn't. The link shows that the ice sheet in Antarctica has been increasing, but that data is irrelevant as it includes irrelevant figures. Land Ice is the only thing that matters to sea levels. "first off NASA has been sued for refusing to release their raw data and messing with models." No they haven't. There's a reason no lawsuits like that have actually gone through. You clearly don't understand how data analysis and manipulation works, which doesn't surprise me as we've already demonstrated your ignorance on scientific terms. "Raw data" can be renamed as "base figures" or "irrelevant data." The aggregation of raw data is necessary to a proper analysis, otherwise you'll factor in irrelevant figures to whatever it is you're measuring (Just as you seem to want to do with Antarctic Sea Ice for some reason.) "but even they still say that the growth of the ice more then makes up for any melting that is happening." No, they don't say it "makes up" for it, they say that overall more ice is formed than has melted. These are two different things, because it is Land Ice that is melting and Sea Ice that is freezing. "it shows that the IPCC and NASA disagree on things." No, it just shows you failing to actually read the reports thoroughly.

Ozone levels over Antarctica have dropped causing stratospheric cooling and increasing winds which lead to more areas of open water that can be frozen. But Sea Ice isn't really all that important to the discussion, Sea Ice is already in the water, it's melting or freezing doesn't alter sea levels by any notable amount. The melting of Land Ice, however, does. Land Ice in both the Arctic and Antarctic, have been decreasing. And seeing as global temperatures have been increasing, leading to this event, I don't see where you're attempting to stand your position.

There is no person on the planet that can tell what is going to happen to the climate in 20 or 50 or 100 years much less 1,000&#39;s of years. Hell, they can&#39;t even tell us if it&#39;s going to rain next Tuesday with any great certainty.   The hole in the Ozone everyone was so worried about decades ago has now been shown to open and close. Hello-- It&#39;s a vent for the Earth.  God, or Mother Nature or whomever you believe created the universe, and thus, this planet Earth we call home, wasn&#39;t an idiot.  The Earth self-regulates........just like our bodies self-regulate......just like every other living creature does.   It warms. It cools.  It ices. It floods.  It&#39;s cyclical.   MAYBE it&#39;s happening a little faster due to our hair spray bottles and factory exhaust??  But little tiny human animals can&#39;t destroy the GIANT earth. Only arrogant liberals think that!<br />Besides, no one is willing to go back to 1750 and live without modern conveniences.  Some bright wiper-snapper will invent a clean energy source in the next 100 years that will end our dependence on fossil fuels.  But until then, the stuff we have (solar, electric, etc.......)  are just petty attempts. We have nothing CLOSE to compete with the efficiency of good old fossil fuels yet. But it will come. And all of this &#39;climate change/global warming&#39; will just be a silly little short chapter in an old history book (in holograph form I assume-- paper is so 20th century). :)      So keep your panties on climate change cultists.

None of this right here seems to be helping, but it's certainly made worse by nihilistic, fatalistic morons who don't think before they type. People who say things like "well, we're all gonna die anyway, so why would anything matter". Sounds like the perfect excuse to say "so I'm going to act like a jerk and not change anything, because I can't change anything, and I won't even try". Can you imagine anyone living their life this way? I can't either. You're still very young, and you should have a future to look forward to. And you do. This video was made in 2016 and the message is correct. We may not be able to turn it all around just now, but we still have a strong influence on how bad this is going to end up being for most of the planet. Scientists say so as well, and if anyone knows, it's them. It took a while to sink in, but thanks to the recent report from the IPPC (that's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), in the last months of 2018, climate change made the news so much that the world is finally waking up. Follow news in science, business, and environment and you will notice a race is starting towards renewable energies like solar power, lots of work being done to finally clean up our oceans, big companies like Coca-Cola and Nestle are trying to dramatically reduce plastic in their packaging - and plastic is made from petroleum/fossil fuels as well - something most people forget. At the same time, many factories are re-thinking the way they work and how they can switch to cleaner forms of energy to produce their products. Electric cars and electric bikes are getting more and more popular and charging stations for them are increasing worldwide. There is a new trend called "zero-waste" which helps people in living more environmentally conscious. There is a search engine now called Ecosia, which works like Google, but it plants a tree for every 45 searches you make. It's free and safe and you can find it at http://www.ecosia.org. The trees are important because they are swallowing CO2, which is what makes our planet warm so fast. So the more trees we have on this planet, the better. Many other good things are happening now, especially in the world of international politics. And young people like you are affecting some of the biggest changes. I mean, just look at what 15-year old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg is doing. She is not only the leader of an active student protest, but she basically just told a bunch of older people at the United Nations to get their act together on climate change, and they listened: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzeekxtyFOY. A lot of people all around the world, both young and old, were inspired by her words and are taking action, both in changing their own impact on the environment and in protesting publicly, writing to and talking with the politicians of their countries, states, regions, and cities. There have been student protests in several parts of the world, such as Australia and the United States, and they are continuing. In the United States, for instance, there is the Sunrise Movement, a large and ever-growing group of young environmental activists: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5M1R2rKqNI. They are supporting something called the Green New Deal (more info here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_New_Deal), and quite a few politicians are too. One of the most prominent people working with the Sunrise Movement and pushing the Green New Deal forward is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez). Just look up some news articles about her to see how she is making a difference and making her voice and the voice of her supporters heard. Even climate-change denier Donald Trump can't ignore her - as much as he might want to. The point is, all of these people are making their voices heard and forcing entire governments and industries to listen and change so we CAN have a future, even if it's a messy an uncertain one. And isn't this what truly matters? There is always more that can and should be done, and we can stand with those affecting change and do our very best to affect change in our own lives and those of the people we know. One of the best, easiest ways to do this is to go online and promote change on a number of social media platforms like YouTube, gather good information, always check your sources, talk to proven experts and ask lots of questions - because we are all a bit lost on this and we need all the help we can get to figure things out. I plan on doing just that in a little while with my own YouTube channel. I will start recording videos for it soon, and will link to it here. Lastly, to anyone out there reading my message, ask yourself this: Do you want to be on the side of people who stick their head in the sand out of fear and say "it's all over and we're doomed"? Or do you want to be on the side of those who say "No. Not on my watch. I'm making a change and helping the world!"? I think it's a very easy choice to make.

If you're not living, you don't age. Climate change is likely to get worse over time, it doesn't make humans die and then start living later. You're more likely to live until you're 70 years old than to not live until you're 70 years old.

When you see the videos of massive sheets of ice falling into the ocean that's actually just a natural thing that happens every year called spring when it naturally gets warmer as one part of the earth is closer to the sun, I don't really understand how that works tbh. Also the sea levels are rising because of melting glaciers which are just leftover from the last ice age, not the melting poles as ice actually takes up more volume that liquid water so the sea level would actually drop if it was just the poles. Finally, the current heating actually follows a trend which we see if we look at the temperature graphs around every ice age.

So I'll be covering the main points. #1 sea level rise. First we're going to be looking at the Arctic and from geography class you know it is floating sea ice. Now using the most basic of high school physics we can know that ice displaces water. This means that even if the Arctic melted 100% it wouldn't raise sea levels at all. Now over to the Antarctic which is a completely different story as it is land mass covered in ice and would raise sea levels if it were to melt. However even NASA who has been more than just questionable about there integrity on AGW, they have been sued for refusing to release raw data and for producing false papers. And even they admit that the Antarctic is growing by 82 billions tons per year. #2 Now let's look at CO2 itself. And by the way this is where the 97% consensus comes from, 97% of scientists agree that CO2 warms the earths temperature but the debate is climate sensitivity and I will now explain. Now a lot of the numbers you hear are from the IPCC, and this is a problem because this is not a peer reviewed paper. But if you just look at the IPCC they say you'll get 6 degrees F warming per doubling of CO2. However when you look at the peer reviewed studies almost every paper you look at will say you will get between 1-1.5 degrees F warming per doubling of CO2. This is a massive difference and if you go by the peer reviewed science then at the rate we're going now we have nothing to worry about. #3 But the earth is still warming and has been since the last ice age at a constant rate. And graphs like the hockey stick take a jump in the temperature and make it seem abnormal. If you respond to this without throwing childish insults chances are I'll respond but if you're just going to be a troll I'm out.

In the flat earthy days of yore, we did not have a large scientific community, there was no peer review, and most funding came from sources whose best interest it was to alter the results. Not to mention lack of a scientific method, and methods of religious and political censorship. These advances in science we have today, is why we have had an explosion in scientific advancement, and why life expectancy has almost doubled in the past 100 years. That doesn't mean every conclusion or result is 100% correct, but with the data that we have collected, we are 99% sure that humans affect climate change. The problem we're facing right now, is that our economy is so heavily invested in the current climate. In terms of climate, we should be heading into another cooling period. Instead, the Earth is warming at an alarming rate. Spending a small amount to limit this warming could minimize GDP loss by $50 trillion. For perspective, the US is $20 trillion in debt and there is around $75 trillion in currency, liquid assets, market funds etc. in existence on Earth. Rising CO2 levels would cut off global ocean circulation and cause multi billion dollar fish die offs. We have a lot to gain by preventing Global Warming, and very little to lose.

Looked at the papers, went over the evidence, decided it was true, until 10k other scientists put up new facts/theories and people decided it was true instead. Is there a climate change? I can't say 100%, but I can say we've had it before and people survived it. That whole ice age. We survived it before, no reason to believe we can't survive it again with the high technology level we have today.

Usually proven wrong, but not accepted because "By hell will I be wrong" until much later. This isn't to say there is no climate change. However, the idea that one must accept it because so many people say it's true, has been proven through out history to be a dumb reason to accept it. :p	UCGHcbpN5OoMPbf-HGvYO3mw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGHcbpN5OoMPbf-HGvYO3mw	1	UgiRkszOL3GVx3gCoAEC	CptObvious

As my science teacher said: Would you like to be remembered as the cause of dispair for your children? There's alot you can do to stop global warming YOURSELF. Of course this requires you change your lifestyle, which many aren't ready to do. Therefore the earth is going to hell. And we need everyone to do this. One thing is to stop buying doritos. A little thing. But doritos are made of palm oil, which is being grown in rainforests, which farmers BURN to get more palm oil. This releases all the CO2 the trees had "stored" and also removes some trees that could've made it to O2. So in general, avoid palm oil, sunflower oil f.x is much better and doesn't take up so much space. Also cows. Cows produce so MUCH methane that they are seriously the worst thing you can buy. Buy pig meat or chicken. NOT cow meat. And methane is about 27 times worse than CO2 as a greenhouse gas	UCkkHGqfey5M3EaIPwFU_4cQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkkHGqfey5M3EaIPwFU_4cQ	1	UgiRkszOL3GVx3gCoAEC	CptObvious

Plant vast floating hydroponic farms of the things to prevent them from taking up land space. You will need to make enough of these things to overcome the increasing rates of CO2 production our civilization is making. So that the CO2 won't be released again when the plants die, bury the plants en-masse in sealed concrete bunkers in areas where the world doesn't care, such as Antarctica or the Sahara. This is similar to how we deal with nuclear waste. Replace fossil fuel infrastructure with petrochemical infrastructure and transfer main source of power to solar, wind, tidal, geothermal, or nuclear energy. Fusion is looking promising. Repeat until CO2 reaches levels seen in the 18th century. The planet will warm, and then cool again slightly. Just don't dig the damn things up again and crisis averted. Now here's why it won't work: All of this is too expensive for any one nation to be able to accomplish with their entire GDP, including the US. The world is run by corporations. Nobody on Earth would dare make an investment like this because there is no financial return. People have more wars to fund and religious inquisitions to execute. That's not how power structures work.	UCI6ml9N-o2C5-KAc6gD0noQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI6ml9N-o2C5-KAc6gD0noQ	1	UghdDsxmTrPA0HgCoAEC	Matt

That is so miniscule in the lifetime of the earth it is rediculously arrogant to think we have any true understanding of how we are affecting climate much less make accurate predictions. &quot;97% percent of scientist agree on climate change&quot; is a false statistic based off loose data and vague definitions. If climate change predictions from the 90s came true, the Florida keys would be under water right now. Adam&#39;s condescending tone doesn&#39;t make him right.

Other planets in our solar system have experience temperature changes. Still, this is not an excuse to trash the planet or not look for other sources of energy. Pollution has other effects and the biggest one is overall health. It has been seen in many different countries, such as birth defects and mental health issues are one of the most commonly seen. We are sitting on a gold mine of alternative energy sources that can provide millions of jobs. Not only that, it can increase food supply as well as agricultural science.

We have sped up the greenhouse effect during our industrial revolution but the damage is far from undoable. There in fact are many scientific breakthroughs already being developed to address this issue. One is using iron ore to feed algae blooms. Which produce more oxygen than all of the trees in the world combined per cluster much of the time. I want to address these problems for our planet but I don&#39;t like doomsday theorists lying to people. We can fix this. It IS possible. Stop saying it isn&#39;t.

Also again cite your sources for your rather outlandish claims. The IPCC does this, you should be able to as well. #3 No the Earth has not been warming constantly since the the last ice age, it has been warming since we started keeping records but that's because we only started keeping records in the 1880's so we don't have any records from before the industrial revolution. Recreations however show a stable temperature up until the start of the industrial revolution where it starts rising. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature_record Otherwise you don't actually say anything about the temperature so I don't have much to say.

UgjnJFkhlVRcr3gCoAEC.8MvQZ52IjJD8N9br_zCifC		0	2016-12-31 17:03:27	Alex Schmidt	This is my copy and paste comment because I don't have time to type this out repeatedly. So I'll be covering the main points. #1 sea level rise. First we're going to be looking at the Arctic and from geography class you know it is floating sea ice. Now using the most basic of high school physics we can know that ice displaces water. This means that even if the Arctic melted 100% it wouldn't raise sea levels at all. Now over to the Antarctic which is a completely different story as it is land mass covered in ice and would raise sea levels if it were to melt. However even NASA who has been more than just questionable about there integrity on AGW, they have been sued for refusing to release raw data and for producing false papers. And even they admit that the Antarctic is growing by 82 billions tons per year. #2 Now let's look at CO2 itself. And by the way this is where the 97% consensus comes from, 97% of scientists agree that CO2 warms the earths temperature but the debate is climate sensitivity and I will now explain. Now a lot of the numbers you hear are from the IPCC, and this is a problem because this is not a peer reviewed paper. But if you just look at the IPCC they say you'll get 6 degrees F warming per doubling of CO2. However when you look at the peer reviewed studies almost every paper you look at will say you will get between 1-1.5 degrees F warming per doubling of CO2. This is a massive difference and if you go by the peer reviewed science then at the rate we're going now we have nothing to worry about. #3 But the earth is still warming and has been since the last ice age at a constant rate. And graphs like the hockey stick take a jump in the temperature and make it seem abnormal. If you respond to this without throwing childish insults chances are I'll respond but if you're just going to be a troll I'm out.

People love to tell you the world is going to end if you don't listen to them. It's not the case. The road to solving climate change is in the future, not now, we have plenty of natural problems to deal with, we solve them with technology once we know what the problem is. We currently don't know what the climate change problem is.	UCd6yq8v8-QZ7URQ4AVdPrnQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd6yq8v8-QZ7URQ4AVdPrnQ	1	UgjnJFkhlVRcr3gCoAEC	Kay d

You know, it's not so much about "agree or die", it's about science. There will always be some who disagree on any particular subject. You do nothing for your side or gain support by being an ass - moreover you make those opposed to you more entrenched in their beliefs. As I said in my original, I do enjoy much of what Adam makes clear, yet I also see both sides of this issue. To say that it's clear one way or another when it's not is the main problem.

K, I'm gonna just go over some base science real quick: The Equator is hot because it's exposed to the sun the most because of the way the earth spins, the north and south poles are cold because they hardly get any sun, with them being (on average) the furthest spot on the planet from the sun. So, in the northern hemisphere, it's true that the further north you move, the colder it gets. But, south of the equator, the opposite is true; the further south you get, the colder it gets. Yes, there are deserts that aren't along the equator, but they're the exception that prove the rule. And, during the night during winter in the desert, temperatures regularly get below freezing. If it rains while the temperature is below freezing, there is snow. The huge field of science is all about collecting knowledge, so, yes, scientists have been wrong and will be wrong in the future. But, you can't dismiss global warming because of politics, because you clearly know that the Earth is round and goes around the sun. But, the Catholic Church threw the second part of that out the window because they didn't agree with it, and the Catholic Church has been/is a huge political machine. Every scientist who studies global warming isn't in it for politics, but it's true that many are. If you need sources I will happily give them to you.

(and this isn&#39;t making the point that it is too small of a % to have an effect)<br /><br />ALL the models have been wrong! every stinking one of them. not one has shown to be good at anything but making money. but have they lowered the sensitivity factors of co2 to make an adjustment? nah. not scary enough. you people need to do your own research. start with the bogus bristlecone studies on past temperatures. you know, &quot;PROXY&quot; data. search for the inclusion of the &quot;yam&quot; bristlecone pines. see what you find. search for something called &quot;hide the decline&quot; and then get back to me on how this &quot;proxy&quot; stuff has been going. and then get back to me on the definition of &quot;data&quot;.

Proxies match closely with temperature data before the 60s. The goal of Mann's work was to show the most accurate approximations of temperature over the past few thousand years that he could, and including tree-ring proxy data that is known to be inaccurate in that would have been misleading, not informative.

You would have to convince major companies to lose, as he said, trillions, in the name of something that won&#39;t affect them within their lifetime. It&#39;s hard to convince people to work to change something that won&#39;t affect them. And yes, I know it&#39;s already getting hotter. But it will still be a while before we see the truly drastic changes of all of this. If it was going to kill us all in say, 10 years, it might be a lot easier to push change. By the time we get to that point though, the damage will be irreversible. Everything has an end. Even the human race.

UgivB6o7ebRVCngCoAEC	0	6	2016-12-25 13:28:53	Corey Doyle	A Type II alien race several thousand years into the future from now, investigates the source of primitive radio messages. Having existed alone for many thousands of years, they&#39;ve been hunting down any signs of extraterrestrial life they can. Immediately they plan an expedition and set out on their several hundred year journey. After many generations they set upon the planetary system from which the radio signal originated. With their most advanced telescopes the planet finally comes into focus. Dread sets in on the foreign visitors. Dead, dry, and hot. A probe is sent to assess the planets state. Similar to it&#39;s neighbor, they conclude the planet has succumb to a runaway greenhouse effect. Perhaps the inhabitants fled to a new system before their doom?<br /><br />Several decades, mere human years to them, are spent attempting to translate the radio messages they&#39;ve collected during the travel. The humans as they were called, went extinct through their own means several thousand years ago. They never reached a civilization capable of successful space expansion and utilization of viable energy sources. Rather, they were dependent on the fuel of long-dead organic carbon. What&#39;s more, through their use of this dirty energy, they knowingly killed themselves, and their planet. Deep in the Earth&#39;s hot, dry surface, their probe samples some little surviving microbes. The legacy of Earth, and it&#39;s final organic inhabitant. Three and a half billion years, through evolution, life, death, unfathomable history, of Humans, and of animals. The unique Geological formations and processes, an immense time belonging to the planet, where a film on it&#39;s surface called itself life. All vanished, a quiet whisper in the universe.<br /><br />But if it&#39;s of any consolation, our history has been curated by these long overdue visitors. They spend some years sampling the planet, find some contraptions they conclude to be of human origin on the surface of other planets, and finally say goodbye. All gathered data during their expedition is propagated out through space with means far faster than radio, to be effective indefinitely. It&#39;s finally time to set out to the next destination, hoping the next civilization fared better.<br /><br />(Disclaimer: this is rough, just threw together by inspiration over the last 10 minutes, critique with this in mind)	UCd450940qDfFgXXfDlOnY5w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd450940qDfFgXXfDlOnY5w	0

UgjGXVn1-AogLngCoAEC.8MuTOEP_KCd8NLbqp6cIEP		0	2017-01-05 08:54:14	Rob S	Where to begin...#1: Arctic ice isn't all floating sea ice. Glaciers and permafrost cover vast swaths of land in Greenland, Canada, Scandinavia, and Russia. If those melt, sea levels rise. Also, high school physics tells you that white objects (like ice) reflect more electromagnetic radiation than darker objects (like ocean water) - think about wearing a white t-shirt vs. a navy blue t-shirt in the sun. The less floating ice there is, the more radiation absorbed, and the warmer the water gets, which in turn affects the neighboring land ice. #2: First, "per doubling of CO2" is a useless statistic when you don't mention the starting amount, the starting date, the time it takes to double the amount, etc. to make a valid comparison between current, past, and forecasted CO2 output. If we double atmospheric CO2 every year, then even 1-1.5 degrees F is a massive deal. Second, the IPCC is peer-reviewed: https://www.ipcc.ch/news_and_events/docs/factsheets/FS_review_process.pdf Third, the IPCC numbers in the chart I found (https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/syr/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf, page 9) give a rough estimate of a mean global temperature increase of about 4 degrees F per *cumulative* doubling of current CO2 output. With no mitigating changes taken, the first doubling will occur by 2035. That's pretty soon. I don't know where you found other peer reviewed studies that got the 1-1.5 degree number, so feel free to link several sources to back up your claim that "almost every paper you look at" gets that number. #3: There is no time in human existence that the Earth has been this hot, and it's getting hotter. All of the warming and cooling of the Earth that has happened since the dawn of human civilization has varied by about a degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit). Since 1990, mean global temperatures have increased by just under a degree Celsius. That means in 26 years, the mean temperature has made a change that used to take hundreds, if not thousands of years. That's abnormal.

UgjGXVn1-AogLngCoAEC.8MuTOEP_KCd8N9buOMZQA4		0	2016-12-31 17:03:50	Alex Schmidt	This is my copy and paste comment because I don't have time to type this out repeatedly. So I'll be covering the main points. #1 sea level rise. First we're going to be looking at the Arctic and from geography class you know it is floating sea ice. Now using the most basic of high school physics we can know that ice displaces water. This means that even if the Arctic melted 100% it wouldn't raise sea levels at all. Now over to the Antarctic which is a completely different story as it is land mass covered in ice and would raise sea levels if it were to melt. However even NASA who has been more than just questionable about there integrity on AGW, they have been sued for refusing to release raw data and for producing false papers. And even they admit that the Antarctic is growing by 82 billions tons per year. #2 Now let's look at CO2 itself. And by the way this is where the 97% consensus comes from, 97% of scientists agree that CO2 warms the earths temperature but the debate is climate sensitivity and I will now explain. Now a lot of the numbers you hear are from the IPCC, and this is a problem because this is not a peer reviewed paper. But if you just look at the IPCC they say you'll get 6 degrees F warming per doubling of CO2. However when you look at the peer reviewed studies almost every paper you look at will say you will get between 1-1.5 degrees F warming per doubling of CO2. This is a massive difference and if you go by the peer reviewed science then at the rate we're going now we have nothing to worry about. #3 But the earth is still warming and has been since the last ice age at a constant rate. And graphs like the hockey stick take a jump in the temperature and make it seem abnormal. If you respond to this without throwing childish insults chances are I'll respond but if you're just going to be a troll I'm out.

Also saying McCain wasn't a war hero in his eyes because true war heroes don't get caught.

If he hadn't paid his employees squat, paid his taxes, and used American made steel to build his buildings, then he wouldn't Be a successful business man. So what, he's going to rip off America again to make it great again? And I'm not saying that I doubt that a million dollars is nothing to him, I'm saying that him using that as a selling point is terrible because it shows how disconnected he is to the rest of the country. Plus he acted like a million dollars was nothing Before he made his billions. I can understand why it feels like nothing to him now, but back then he didn't have anything that wasn't his dad's, so that shows that even back then he was showered with wealth so much that even when he had nothing, a million dollars was still nothing. But anyway, that was just one of the things he said, and far from the worst or most surprising(probably in the bottom 10%) so I don't really feel angered about it at all. What does get me is when people think that because he was a successful business man that means he'll be a successful commander in chief. in business you have to be ruthless to succeed, whereas politics takes a softer touch, because other people have nukes too, but also a firm one I admit. imo the most important quality the president has to have is empathy, the ability to see both sides and understand where they're coming from.

That by itself should prove he's not the person we need anywhere near the nuclier codes, but if your still a trump supporter after seeing everything that has happened, and everything he's said then I certainly won't change your mind.

We are due for an ice age. Global warming could be thwarting a natural ice age. An ice age would be worse for the earth than global warming. We could fix global warming, get hit with an ice age.

Billions more would struggle. And while we can argue that billions of deaths wouldn't necessarily be bad for resource availability and the environment, that's a moot point in an ice age. We actually have the capacity to survive well without losing billions of people, it's just going to take a lot of work and some more technological advancement. As for the remaining people in an ice age, it would be rough. We'd have to setup indoor crops, complete with heating and such, enough to feed billions. We'd have to completely change the way we live in order to survive, and cheap/easy energy would be just as important....I mean if anything we'd want to accelerate a greenhouse effect in an ice age to end it sooner. So much for not using fossil fuels. And ice age could kill huge amounts of plant life, which would have huge repercussions. Just because the earth survived ice ages before doesn't mean they aren't devastating, it takes thousands of years for life to recover from an ice age. With the rate we are advancing, in 100 years people might actually laugh at how freaked out people were about global warming, and might actually remember it as one of those premature mass scares of ignorance. Fact is, we all have this perspective about life on earth and all the cycles its been through, but the reality is this: The earth has lost over 99% of its diversity to natural disaster, from ice ages to asteroids and whatever else......the soup that made life soo diverse has long been cooked, meaning we will never get that diversity back without another 4 billion years of evolution from scratch, and that may not actually be possible. The earth may support life now, but in all actuality, the earth that gave the conditions for the beginning of life doesn't exist anymore, that means once life is extinguished on earth, it may be extinguished once and for all.

The other several hundred thousands spread across the world believe it is. In the literature (which is the important part because that's what has to be proven) there is only a few suggestions for things other than humans that could cause the climate change. But the simple thing is, we know CO2 is a green house gas. We know we're pumping millions of tons of it into the atmosphere. We cannot do that without the planet warming up.

And they were TOTALLY wrong. Nothing he predicted happened. These same scientists wanted to close the &quot;hole in the ozone&quot; until they realized it was a natural design. In the 70&#39; everyone was talking about how the earth was cooling. 97% of climate scientist believe in warming (the the ones who get paid based of that idea). The North Pole is losing ice!!!! (While the south is GAINING ice). All while climate change warriors fly in their private jets.	UCHwAzdhXYskfe0n1pY2pEvQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHwAzdhXYskfe0n1pY2pEvQ	0

Don't let them lie to you. There's one exception- I have no idea what you're talking about by calling the "hole in the ozone" a natural design. You're probably one of those guys who doesn't know the difference between the greenhouse effect and the ozone, which are two separate issues. Human intervention caused the hole in the ozone and other human intervention ended the damage that we were doing to it. The ozone, for the most part, is no longer of concern. That doesn't mean anything about the greenhouse effect which we still care about very much. There did exist scientists in the 70's that believed that the earth was cooling though. But they WEREN'T "EVERYONE" they were the minority. If they were the majority, it wouldn't matter. That was the seventies. Things are unknown before they are known. The idea that the earth was cooling was circulated but it wasn't officially accepted as a truth. It would have to be proven in order to be accepted as a truth. The idea that the earth is cooling was not accepted as a truth like the scientific community agrees that the earth is warming today. The scientific method is an extremely rigorous process for proving things and the warming of the planet passes that process no one claimed that the idea of the earth cooling did. Also you don't seem to understand how the scientific community works. If anyone is getting paid it's the scientists that deny climate change. Embracing the idea that climate change is happening doesn't sell to oil companies that may hire you otherwise. Name the corporation or private entity that wants to pay someone to cry about climate change.

It won't be centuries, that is the problem. Also, nearly every scientist in the world agrees that climate change is happening and that we are influencing it because that is precisely what the evidence we have gathered for decades suggests. If you would like to argue that 97%+ of the scientific community agrees with climate change because it somehow benefits them... well, all I can say is "prove it."

There's already enough so much Co2 in the ocean that we're seeing huge dead zones. There are a few predictions that by 2049 our oceans will be too acidic to support life and die off.

The biggest feminist are usually men. Men are very self destructive, and not loyal to their group, they are far more loyal to women as agroup then other men, while women are very loyal to their own group and do not care one bit about men, and are much smarter than men in the social game, men are almost retarded in the social game. In their so called fight against feminist, they actually want to protect women more and be harder and rougher against men, that is the result when they want manliness in style of clint eastwood. Men are stupid, that is why feminist exist. If just men cared about his brother in the same way women cared about her sister, we would not have feminist.

You can support women's rights but not 3rd wave feminists, women's rights is one thing, mainstream feminism is another. Mainstream feminism is a very specific movement with a biased agenda that is always in favor of women and in detriment to men. If the MRAs would fight agianst women's rights gatherings would you still consider them a movement for "equality"? Feminists (NOW organization) fight each year against shared parenting, feminists fight against men's rights issues groups in universities, feminists fight against men's rights groups, feminists have been trying to bad a men's rights movie (The Red Pill) from the day it was launched. Other than that everything feminism stands for is biased, the Violence against Women act is sexist and it favors women over men, feminists are fighting for the law to prosecute men of rape solely based on a woman's word meaning throwing innocent men in jail at each false rape accusation, "manspreading" but no womanspreading, "mansplaining" but no womanspalining" quotas for women only, affirmative action in jobs and education for women only, this seems "equality" to you? Leaving aside the fact that in Western countries women have the same rights as men, there is no right that men have and women don't, only rights that women have and men don't, men are discriminated by gender in divorce deals where women always get the best deal, in child custody as women get it 95% of times, in prison time as men get longer sentences for the exact crime women do, in alimony as men pay alimony 98% of times.

I know wage gaps do occur but as you say they are rare and have nothing to do with discrimination against one gender only. And next to your example there are also men who are paid less for the same work women do, male models are paid 6 times less than female models for example. But the vast majority of cases women and men are paid the exact same. Feminists are simply that misandrist and eager to demonize men that they would turn the earnings gap (all men earning more than all women put together because men work more hours, pick better jobs, take less vacations) into a "wage gap". In the same way feminists demonize men and lie about some "rape culture". And the saddest part is that no matter how many facts are proven to feminists they don't care and continue to follow their sexist movement, simply because feminism is an ideology and not based on facts, so of course facts don't matter.

I agree with you in this argument in nearly every single aspect minus the Wage gap thing. While yes there is a law gender wage gaps do occur but is not a large scale thing but instead a localised thing for example a store owner should he be sexist would pay men more than the females despite the same working times holidays etc. So it does occur but even then its a small scale thing and can't really be controlled that well. Other than that i support you all the way	UC0CgD2qj0ucwZbYv1v4EN5g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0CgD2qj0ucwZbYv1v4EN5g	1	Uggdze9MkbvX13gCoAEC	Kyle Mylo

Women are paid as much as men, the "wage gap" means that men on average earn more than women which is because men work more hours than women, choose more dangerous jobs which pay better, choose better paying jobs, and take less vacations, but for the same exact job and same hours spent women are paid as much as men, there is a law against a "wage gap" called the Equal pay act". Are you seriously that indoctrinated that you want people to let laws that hurt men as a group and hurt innocent people and demonize people and are biased against one gender and not even state that these laws are sexist or it is "aggressive"?

The definition of nazism was also a party that promoted equality and rights for everyone. A movement is defined by what it stands for not what it's self-made definition says. You only have to look at what feminism stands for, fights for, pushes for, promotes, and you will get your answer on what the movement is. Feminists have created VAWA - the law that states that in domestic violence men are the standard perpetrators and women are the standard victims, now you wouldn't call the MRM a movement that fights for equality if they made the law be biased against women and in favor of men in domestic violence or in any other area would you? Feminists create the No means No law which is only against men and not women who do the exact same thing, feminists are pushing for the law to prosecute men of rape solely based on a woman's word meaning throwing innocent men in jail at each false rape accusation, feminists are pushing to end shared parenting meaning forbid fathers to have equal rights to their children, feminists fight against men's rights gatherings and meetings, feminists riot against men's issues groups right as almost every university has women's issues group, feminists created gender studies which demonize men to the point of calling men "born rapists" , everything else feminists stand for is biased and sexist, "mansplaining" (which is the most sexist way to address a man) but no "womansplaning", "manspreading" but no "womanspreading" "toxic masculinity" but no toxic femininity, sexualizing women is bad, sexualizing men is ok. This is "equality" to you? If the men's rights movement stood for only one of these things for example riot against feminist meetings or push for the law to prosecute women solely based on men's word you wouldn't call them a movement for "equality" would you	UCpE9ElGPrSR5IwyRxHOleiw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpE9ElGPrSR5IwyRxHOleiw	1	Uggdze9MkbvX13gCoAEC	Kyle Mylo

We have the ability outsmart &quot;mother nature&quot; and save a large chunk of people doomed to die, yet we do nothing. But somehow we think we can control the sun and stop it from &quot;warming&quot; our planet. Plants, which those with common sense call food, does better in a warmer climate. At least I don&#39;t remember seeing crops at the North Pole. Poor Santa. A whole whopping two degree increase in global temperatures? That&#39;s it?

We have had natural ice ages and warming since the earth was created. I agree that we should protect the environment as much as we can but not at the expense of humanity. I also agree that we can affect the amount and timing of climate change but the rate is extremely minor compared to what happens naturally. I also believe that the extreme uproar about the horrors of climate change is either politically or monetarily motivated more than it is actually real.

It is happening orders of magnitude faster... and is happening at a faster and faster rate every year. All the data we have points directly at this not being a natural event. And since the climate is shifting, likely dangerously, an extreme uproar should be the natural response. It should be even more extreme than it is. We should be going out of our way to enact changes to prevent as much of the danger as possible, not waste time going "Wellllllll....... it _may_ not be all _that_ bad." As they say, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.	UCtwc1dy5P8AKY8ksG3-m4DQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtwc1dy5P8AKY8ksG3-m4DQ	1	Ugh_MnGMSjy_4XgCoAEC	77rviper

Reducing industrial output as part of pollution abatement so people in the future have better stuff is a transfer from people today to people in the future. People in the future will be much richer than today, so climate abatement is a regressive transfer from the poor to the rich. Why do they bemoan tax cuts for the rich (transfer from poor to rich) but support the same thing here?	UCakMf-R9AcSw05U9jFGwdXw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCakMf-R9AcSw05U9jFGwdXw	0

The environmental impacts of nuclear is insignificant compared to coal and none of those impacts would effect climate. That being said, the aversion to nuclear has nothing to do with government control. Believe it or not, there's plenty of science denialism on the left as well. There are plenty on the left who are terrified of GMOs, vaccines, "chemicals in their food", fluoridated water and nuclear power. This is actually a symptom of a bigger problem. Distrust of our institutions has reached a level where we've reverted to a state of anti-intellectualism where science and critical thinking are sneered at. People would rather blindly accept the beliefs of their political association rather than objectively look at the evidence. This happens on both sides of the isle. On the right there are people refusing to accept the theory of evolution, climate change, the big bang theory and many new discoveries in psychology that destroy their view that people behave as rational self serving agents in a free market.

The Fukushima plant, currently with its leak, is putting off about as much radioactive material as the average coal-fired plant. But the Left doesn't want us to use nuclear power, because if we actually fix the problem they can't use it to increase government control.

Period. And the only thing climate scientists agree on is that it happens with or without humanity. There us NO CONSENSUS in the field as to how much humanity is affecting it, because there is NO DEFINITIVE UNDERSTANDING of the climate. It is impossible to state a cause of you do not even understand the mechanism which you&#39;re dealing with. While it&#39;s obvious man is affecting the climate, it&#39;s impossible to judge what man&#39;s effect actually does in the grand scheme, as geological and historical data have shown that the climate has been known to fluxuate and change. Both the Carboniferous and Jurassic climates had more CO2 in the atmosphere than we&#39;d ever hope to put in, and were correlated with explosions of life, just to put perspective.<br /><br />Secondly, it is a childish notion to say the reason we don&#39;t give up fossil fuels is solely for monetary purposes: childish in the respect that, like a child, you only see the surface of the situation, but argue that it is the whole world. Fossil fuels are the cleanest and cheapest fuels to date. Because of them: food is cheaper, with farming slowly trending towards centralization, meaning carving out large swaths of land/sea are becoming less common; people live twice as long on average, with medicine and hygiene having increased in ways we couldnt have imagined as a civilization beforehand; communication and travel are possible faster and over longer distances, and with innovation able to spread/reach new people and markets, one could argue it has made freedom and self-determination all the more available to the world, but I will not as I am unprepared and ill-informed in that correlation.<br /><br />I recognize the fact that a changing of minds from a laundry list of things I have compiled is unlikely. If you read nothing else, let it be that you never get all your facts from a guy pretending to do comedy, and keep open perspectives. Merry Christmas.

Alaniz I've read exactly what you wrote and you are leaving out the fact that the climate is changing much more rapid than it ever did before. We witness a change in a century that was before seen in thousands or even millions of years. And your argument is also that there can't be a consensus oon how much we are affecting the climate as we are not understanding it enough. The latter might be true, but from all we DO know today, there IS a consensus around scientists in that field that the change is man-made. Natural changes that did already happen in the history of the Earth happened way slower.

It has changed before us. It will long after we are gone. Temperature records which politicians and media love to cite were started near the end of a period of cooler temperatures which has been commonly called the Little Ice Age: a cool trend which started in the late 18th century, reached its height in the mid-19th, then began warming again in the early 20th. Before that period, it was a trend of warmer temperatures. Before that period, it was the Medieval Cool Period. Before then, the Roman Warm Period... Hopefully you're noticing a trend. People who study climate, aka climatologists, as well as its prehuman trends, aka geologists, have for a century observed this fact all over the globe. There have been numerous hypotheses as to why these trends change. The only conclusion and consensus reached by any of these experts through the decades is that there are numerous reasons as to why the climate changes. The largest factor that has been established is the sun. The sun affects the planet far more than any other factor, and it goes through cycles of solar activity that repeat and affect the climate. As it ages, it will get brighter and stronger. You can be certain the climate will be affected by that. In tandem with the sun, there are other factors on the Earth itself. Plate tectonics, landmass and vulcanism. Ocean currents. Wind patterns. Vegetation itself. Factors go on. The human effect on the climate is real too. No one denies that, however, in comparison to all these other factors, and considering that because of them the climate changes, the weight of humanity's effect on the climate is unknown. The correlations between climate change and human intervention as a whole are not as strong as these other factors. That is why there is not real consensus, despite what politicians and bloggers would have you believe with false data and claims of climate papers. Politicians like the ones at the UN and the blogger who first compiled the "97% consensus" are not climatologists. They do not understand the climate, only what they are told by their select advisors and friends whom they choose solely because they agree with THEIR beliefs, not to teach them about facts they don't know. That is why I take statements by the UN about the climate at face value: limited. Because they don't know any more about the climate that you or I do.

Alaniz's position is that we are probably changing the climate, but it's impossible to determine whether or not the changes are good or bad.  Well let's look at the predictions.  Sea levels will rise, causing people who inhabit coastal regions to be climate refugees.  It will also change what land you can grow food on.  The UN estimates by 2050 there will be as many as 150 million climate refugees.  Miami is already raising roads and building seawater pumping stations to battle rising sea levels, at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars over the next decade.  There is also the possible scenario that beyond 2degC of warming, various positive feedback cycles will be unleashed, such as the permafrost thawing and methane being released in Siberia.  This could lead to 5-8degC+ of warming.  There is a chance that due to the gross instability climate change could unleash that the capacity for organized society will be eliminated.  How is a government supposed to keep things in line when there is a climate refugee crisis?  A food crisis?  Resource wars? 	UCt-9_25vaHqXWrDmEj143vg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt-9_25vaHqXWrDmEj143vg	1	UghYfSsjSrV7nHgCoAEC	Xander Alaniz

Rather, I merely challenge that such a negative effect is bring produced when the Earth and its ecosystem has worked with far greater amounts that we could ever produce. When looking at the geological time scales, it becomes clear that the climate we live in is not the norm, rather the outlier which has existed for about 50 million years at best. Within that time, ice appeared and remained through the seasons: something which wasn't remotely common in any other age except one. Equally so, it changed with the appearance of grasses, which creates climates based off of plains. Also within that time, humanity evolved. We are a product of millions of years of evolution and the culmination of every carcass and failed species which through survival of the fittest lead to what we can do today. Nature doesn't flow in cycles, as you say. It may appear to, but it rather flows in waves, because nothing repeats. One could argue that, because we as humans are a part of nature, what we do is just another step in nature. We, however, are the only ones, so such a hypothesis cannot be proven or disproven...

You fail to see that almost every process in nature works via a circle, although most of these are very intricate and hard to oversee. But common sense would be enough to realize that it can't be good for nature if you break it's delicate balance that took many million years to set in.

The number used by "climate scientists" to describe their consensus is from a study by John Cook et al in 2013 of climate papers. The term "study" is loose, because he created no explicitly defined terms to describe what a consensus was, and even included a considerable number of papers that simply made reference to the term "climate change," without context. In reality, GENUINE climatologists and meterologists DO NOT have a consensus as to the effects of human emissions on the climate overall, nor do they allude to a consensus. The only people who do are politicians, scientists who do not actually study climate, and famous people who know even less.

The Earth hasn&#39;t has the same temperature for the last billion years, it has been going up and down without our help. We are currently coming out of an ice age. If humans didn&#39;t exist, the temperature would still be going up. Ok we are speeding up the increase, and shouldn&#39;t, so cut the panic down a notch or two. Why not use Monsanto or other GM company to create a plant that produces large amount of natural oil to run diesel cars ? or run cars on ethanol ? both have zero impact and we don&#39;t need to change cars or petrol stations much.

You would go to the politicians, captains of industry? And how would you convince them? Data? Facts? Good luck! The only facts they won&#39;t challenge are the ones that keep the wheels greased and the dollars rolling in. But what if... what if there was a way of skipping the middle man and putting the critical news directly into everyone&#39;s head? The probability of wide-spread annihilation kept going up. The only way to stop it was to show it, to scare people straight. Because what reasonable human being wouldn&#39;t be galvanized by the potential destruction of everything they&#39;ve ever known or loved? To save civilization, I would show its collapse. How do you think this vision was received? How do you think people responded to the prospect of imminent doom? They gobbled it up like a chocolate eclair! They didn&#39;t fear their demise, they re-packaged it. It could be enjoyed as video-games, as TV shows, books, movies, the entire world wholeheartedly embraced the apocalypse and sprinting towards it with gleeful abandon. Meanwhile your earth was crumbling all around you. You&#39;ve got simultaneous epidemics of obesity and starvation. Explain that one! Bees and butterflies start to disappear, the glaciers melt, algae blooms. All around you the coal mine canaries are dropping dead and you won&#39;t take the hint! In every moment there&#39;s the possibility of a better future, but you people won&#39;t believe it. And because you won&#39;t believe it you won&#39;t do what is necessary to make it a reality. They dwell on this terrible future and you resign yourselves to it for one reason, because that future doesn&#39;t ask anything of you today. So yes, we saw the iceberg and warned the Titanic. But you all just steered for it anyway full steam ahead. Why? Because you want to sink! You gave up! It&#39;s not the monitor&#39;s fault, that&#39;s yours.

And looking at other factors, such as the sun, or even the natural environmental shifting can not be responsible for the exponential rate of increase of global temperature. The Earth is getting hotter, and by our hand or not, we should attempt to halt the exponentially increasing temperature, by any means necessary, because in order for our species to survive, it is necessary.

If it did, they'd be pushing for nuclear power at every possible turn. They'd be looking at ways to lower the Earth's temperature--ever hear of the "Year Without a Summer," or the temperature spike after 9-11? They'd be finding ways to force the world's largest polluters--far more than America--from pumping far more CO2 into the atmosphere than we do. At the least, they'd be extremely concerned with whether or not it's true. When the CRU leak exposed widespread corruption, both in suppression of dissent and in "cooking the books," the Left would have desperately sought out the rot in this vital movement and cut it out before it could spread--but instead they said "Oh, they investigated themselves and said it's all cool.... so quit pointing it out." But they don't... so they don't. It's not about the climate, and it's not about the environment, and it never was. It's about control. It's about giving more money and more power to the government. It's about silencing anybody who disagrees with them--it's about making other people obey--purportedly for their own good, but that doesn't matter so long as they obey.

But the Left doesn't care in the slightest about this stuff, because taking steps to curb it won't give them any control over the American economy. India isn't as bad because it isn't as socialist--but the Indian government is clear that they're not going to cripple themselves because guys who already got caught cooking the books say we have to return to the stone age or fry.

Here, read this: https://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/briefs/shindell_01/ Excerpt: "Over the long term, the size of the ozone hole is governed by emissions of chlorine and bromine containing compounds, for example chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), generated mostly by human activities. Year-to-year variability, however, is determined mostly by temperature variations in the upper atmosphere." So yeah, there is a natural cyclic component, but most of the long-term change is due to human activities. This is like saying that all ice change is natural because some of it happens in a yearly cycle. 2) A refrigerator not only moves heat, but also creates it. If you leave a refrigerator with the door open in a closed room, the room will heat up. Otherwise, displacing heat from cold places to hot places would be a reversible process. A refrigerator is not an adiabatic machine. 3) And yes, buy less beef, for example. You will reduce emissions. Humans heat the planet, humans are made up of individuals. Individuals can "save the planet". Just pointing out inaccuracies in a random youtube comment.

But yeah, it's been discovered that the ozone "hole" is a naturally occurring phenomenon. It is a seasonal cycle. It wasn't detected before because nobody was looking for it prior to the late 60's-early 70's. Plus satellite technology wasn't there to help out. And lots of electrical devices and equipment produce ozone. And yes, I was talking about traditional "heaters" which BTW are still in very common use today. "heaters" are heat PRODUCING devices, whereas refrigerators, air conditioners, heat pumps, Peltier heatsinks, ect. are heat MOVERS. So it's technically incorrect to call a refrigerator a "heater in reverse". But, it as much one cools something and the others warms somthing, yeah it could be viewed as a "reverse heater". And I agree there almost nothing that individuals can do to help "save the planet" as they think they are doing.

Ughi96f27DRNWngCoAEC.8MrZmhtQolT8O8Fki3X1Bw		1	2017-01-25 00:53:42	KingMonogatari	Lee S. As far as "saving the planet" and doing our part... it won't actually do much. The only thing you can "save" by conserving energy is a few bucks on your electric bill. The effect that people could have would only be minimal, heck in some cases production of these "green" products would actually increase our CO2 output. We can't just suddenly change our entire infrastructure around this problem. It kind of sucks, but we can't do much about it right now. Unless someone comes up with a revolutionary solution, the only "immediate and drastic" solution would be a large and sudden change up our entire infrastructure, and that could cause just as much harm as the warming could. You can't just throw everything out and start over, A drastic and sudden change in how every aspect of life works would cause people to fight, panic, and die. Changes have to be paced correctly and account for loss of jobs, people moving around, and cost of producing these alternatives. So it can't be "immediate and drastic". As of right now the only effective solution is kind of what we've been doing. Save a little energy where you can even if it won't do much, and research into making alternative energy cheaper and more effective. All the while you have to pay attention to how those changes would affect people (e.g. what about all those people who have jobs in the oil industry. You have to at the very least "look" into giving them some kind of alternate way to make money, whether that be a new job or reference). But while we can't do much, the worst thing we can do is ignore it outright. You see, if we don't treat it like a problem even if a new revolutionary solution does miraculously pop up, we won't take steps for it. People are much more willing to take simple steps for a solution as long as they can identify with the problem. For example, we don't pretend that human trafficking doesn't exist because the signs are hard to spot and a normal person can't do much about it. We make organizations that with the right funding and research, might be able to help some of those people. The simplest solution is just put people who want to further science and technology into positions of power through organizations, voting, funding, etc. (and even then you funding a person/organization is something you have to be careful with and put a lot of research into before hand. Look at all those charities that use like 90% of their funds to pay their executives and advertise and only 10% goes to the cause.)

Except all of my edits were small grammatical errors or times I felt I wasn't specific enough in an explanation. I think I only mentioned the Ozone hole once, did you just not find the comment. Also I think some other guy responded to you more in depth on the Ozone. Did you just confuse his post with mine? I've known for a long time that it had little to do with CO2. More with other chemicals we put into the air. Of course the "hole" is not an actual hole but thinning, why would it actually be an area completely devoid of ozone? That would end up getting filled at least minimally anyways due to the higher concentration around it if it was a perfect hole. It's just a very significant thinning. As for the "it's natural" argument, I'm not sure I believe that. So just to be sure, you're telling me that it was a coincidence that it thinned out dramatically when we started pumping those chemicals out, and a coincidence that it suddenly slowed down when we stopped. And say it is a naturally occurring thing. So is death, heat transfer, extinction of some species, but humans can still add to and/or speed up the problem. Now I will admit I don't know much about that. I don't think I've read any of the peer-reviewed work on that or seen much of the science and math behind it, so I can't say confidently that my idea is true. I also wonder if the common use of computers might of helped. Computers actually produce a small bit of ozone, I wonder if the millions (or is it billions? I don't know how many computers there are.) of computers being used actually has any effect. If there has already been a study on it, I'd like to know. Just curious. Also, a refrigerator is a backwards heater. It uses energy (electricity) to move heat around from the inside of the fridge to the outside. Your house heater works much the same way. It takes heat from the outside (catching it using coolants), a boiler, or other source and moves it inside. That's why some heaters are air conditioner/heater combos. Depending on where you direct the heat absorbed by the coolant, you can move the heat from inside to out, or outside to in. Now I assume you're talking about an old fashion coil heater in terms of "producing" heat. Even then, the coils can still be compared to those coiled back refrigerators. Heat is retrieved/produced and distributed through the coils. But misunderstanding nuances aside, we're getting off topic. The point was that the science of heat transfer was the same, and is the same science and math that were used to predict and determine the effect CO2 would have on the atmosphere. You don't find it interesting that the global temperature data we have been collecting for decades matches what the predicting formulas have found?

People with a common agenda agreeing with each other's conclusions. Even the "97%" figure is a lie. Looks like you edited out your remarks about the ozone hole... But I saw them. I can't believe you said that about the "ozone hole". So, we "fixed" it, did we? It's gone now, right? After all the hysteria about how they discovered this "hole" in the ozone layer, and banning CFC's the "hole" is still there. Why, you might ask? Well, after all the hype and continued research, they discovered the ozone "hole" was a naturally occurring phenomenon..... No. say it isn't so... It's actually quite seasonal, and on top of that, it's not actually a "hole" but rather an area that thins in ozone, not an actual hole. Come to find out, it was occurring well before the industrial revolution, and continues to this day... It wasn't getting larger, it wasn't getting thinner, it was just doing what it has always done. Grow and shrink with the seasons. One more thing: A refrigerator, air conditioner or heat pump is not really a "heater in reverse". It's a device that MOVES heat from one place to another. A typical heater PRODUCES heat by using electrical current or burning a fuel, or even direct solar energy in some cases. Don't get me wrong. I don't mind conserving energy where possible and practical to do so. I usually drive frugally to reduce my fuel consumption, I fuss at my kids to turn things off when not needed. I keep my home a bit cool in the winter, and a bit warm in summer, much to the rest of the family's complaints. And I'm constantly trying to think up new ways to make something more energy efficient to help lower our energy consumtion. My main goal is to reduce our expenses, not really to "save the planet", but I don't believe in wasting things needlessly either.

True, seasons have a change in climate, but in 200 years we haven't had the problems with bees dying out and oceanic life dying the way it is now.

The Blizzard of 1888 took place all along the east coast, the blizzard conditions went away, for a while, until another big winter happened some years later and created more severe blizzard conditions in the south east us clear down to Cuba. Same thing is true with drought. 200 years ago, California was in a drought very similar to the one that ended in 2011. But the drought conditions go from New Mexico, to Arizona, to the Great Plains, and the Rocky Mountains and back to California.

Example, the last glacial period started circa 110,000 years ago and ended about 12,000 years ago. That's a 98,000 year period. Seems a bit longer than 200.

The only thing I can think of relating to your 200 years cycle is the solar cycle. Do you mean solar cycle? Plus if that is the cycle you are referring to it backs climate change more than your argument. This is due to the Sun radiating more light and since of the CO2 in the atmosphere is eating away the ozone layer and replacing it it'll trap more light causing temperatures too increase and like you said "seasons are thrown out of whack".

And I thought people like you were tired of hearing "buzzwords" to make a point. You know what else is natural? Food, but we now sped up the process to mass produce it, nature wouldn't of done that on it's own. You know what else is natural? Disease, but lack of proper understanding on how it worked lead to epidemics like the black plague killing way more people than it would if we just acted more "natural" (i.e. bathing and going outside). You know what else is natural? Death, but we also speed that up through murder and genocide. Yes things happen naturally, but humans can speed up the process. We've done this so many times for so many different things, both good and bad. Climate change is one of them. The global temperature has risen in a short amount of time. Even taking the seasons into account the *global* average should stay the same. This can cause irregular weather throughout the world. In fact things like bees dying and coral reefs dying are actually signs of this since they are very sensitive to changes in climate. In fact the temperature can still stay the same with changes in the atmosphere, and things like plants will die because of it (changes in air pressure, concentration of certain elements, ect.), all of which can be caused by the change in a global average. If you want to talk "natural" then we are "naturally" in an ice age. The global average should be dropping, not rising, yet the data shows it is going up. The temperature is rising when it should be falling, and that rings zero alarm bells for you? That's like coming back home and not seeing your front door there and thinking "well this is natural, front doors just randomly disappear from time to time. It doesn't mean someone broke in.". Also you do realize how seasons work right? When it's winter in the northern hemisphere, it's summer in the southern (and vice versa). You do realize the whole planet doesn't get colder right? The heat is just redistributed.	UCFWLp-LhZYqZQ4jMc7PnQPQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFWLp-LhZYqZQ4jMc7PnQPQ	1	Ughi96f27DRNWngCoAEC	KELLSONIC

The faster something becomes the less predicable and harmful the result is. Just apply it to everyday life. If you throw a ball from one hand to the other you are more likely to make a mistake if you go faster and faster. Temperatures are rising and like you say it's natural which is true but humanity is speeding up this process to an extreme degree where soon we won't be able to catch the ball. The earth will survive but as it's the playing field, we our the pawns, only time can tell if we adapt.

You see most Americans use "global warming" which is not a key term to use due to people reading (like yourself) "warming" and thinking that everything gets more warm. It's better to use "climate change" as your term as it includes both hot, warm and cold weather. The main concern with climate change is the extreme fluctuations that it causes. Living in Alberta, Canada (an oil province), the fluctuations have gotten so extreme that in school they highlight climate change everywhere even though it'll put a dent in the Canada economy and cause job loss. Personally I remember during Halloween kids (including myself at the time) had to wear jackets over jackets because it was so cold... But now... I can go outside with shorts and it started to snow at the beginning of December (which over the 15 years living in this country I've never seen). Every year it is getting worse, horribly worse for us Canadians (but it's getting on our part which is nice since it's so cold). But the main thing you have to remember is balance, Newton Thrid Law. For every action there is a reaction of the same magnitude, therefore it gets horribly warm here, it becomes horribly cold somewhere else. These extremes can slow down economic, population and... Etc. You get the idea. This world is changing and you have to adapt to survive. I can go on and on but I don't care about your survival because it'll cause less competition for me. I'll just warn you. Good luck mate	UC70YecElyI0HOvjirkuNDAQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC70YecElyI0HOvjirkuNDAQ	1	Ughi96f27DRNWngCoAEC	KELLSONIC

Most of their studies are done and published simply because they meet arbitrary requirements for publishing (or are hired by a company who wants to sell something). There's a reason I keep mentioning "peer-reviewed studies". To give you an idea of the rigor of the process. A study or journal is successfully labeled peer-reviewed, it means that it is looked over by other experts to validate the findings. And it's not just experts in the exact same field. It's experts from related fields too. A climate change study will be looked at by not only climate change experts but: physicists, chemists, and even mathematicians. These are people who are specifically looking for anything wrong with the study. If *anything* is found to be incorrect, or purposefully misleading the study doesn't make it through. In fact the over 90% (I think it's 97%, but it's been a few months since I've read it) comes from specifically peer-reviewed work. It's not like its over 90% of just random published junk. If you have access to a nice database (which you will if you're in college, but sometimes public libraries have access too), I'd suggest you look up some studies on your own. Both peer-reviewed and not. Once you've read enough of them you'll be able to tell which ones are well made and which ones were done as a last minute thesis that some Graduate student threw together to get their degree (god those are hard to read after a while, the leaps in logic are horrifying). You'll also notice that the quality of the peer-reviewed studies are usually much higher than any of the other ones (although it sometimes means a longer read). Look the fact of the matter is that man-made climate change is real. More recent studies show a high likelyhood that the changes in weather it causes have affected insect populations (which some of those insects, like bees, are kind of important) and coral reefs negatively, and those are just the small effects. Finally we do not know what would happen if it's left unchecked. All we know are small effects on ecosystems that are very atmosphere sensitive. If anyone tells you otherwise, and that they know exactly what will happen, they're likely trying to sell you something (again looking at you Al Gore). The question is less "is it happening?" and more "how bad will it be?". That's the next big question for scientists to find out.

Ughi96f27DRNWngCoAEC.8MrZmhtQolT8No6TkRMufB		3	2017-01-16 19:48:33	KingMonogatari	Lee S. How many of those references were peer reviewed by experts? What do Japanese coral reefs have to do with any of this? Without putting any context you seemingly brought up something unrelated. Without you stating your argument or your logic I can only guess. But then again, if you make the statement vague don't put any of your logic you don't have to put in the effort of explaining yourself if you're wrong. And if I guess wrong you can just throw it on me instead. Simple schoolboy tactics. My guess however would be that you are claiming that reefs aren't affected by changes in temperature and that would be incredibly wrong. Many reefs are dying due to changes in the oceans temperature as well as ocean pollution, hell they can even be slightly affected by people touching them directly. When I was Scuba diving I was told never to touch anything with my bare hands, only with gloves for exactly this reason. Unless you're going to doubt ocean experts next. You might as well throw science out the window then. And I never claimed Climate Change itself to be a "law of physics", that'd be ridiculous. I said it was uses the sames formulas and laws of chemistry and physics that run your everyday household appliances. Your phone isn't a law of physics, but it works. Your heater isn't a law of physics, but it works. Your fridge isn't a law of physics, but it works. Very few things we use are a law of science, but they are bound by those laws. That's what lets them work. By denying the evidence, you're also denying the laws behind that evidence. It'd be like saying oh, the heater works, but the fridge shouldn't because I read it online. Which is ridiculous because a fridge is literally a reverse heater (a heater takes heat from outside and puts it in your home so technically the outside gets slightly colder, a fridge takes the from inside a fridge and moves it outside the fridge. This is why the coils on the back of the fridge heat up) It's all the same science. P.S. Did you just ignore the over 90% of experts. Of course I haven't done every number crunching the experts have. They have been doing it for years, and I trust them. I mainly trust them because of the math and number crunching I have done. It all lined up with studies I have read. Sure I didn't go as far as they did, but I'm spending my years getting a degree in engineering and my main interests lie elsewhere. Let me ask you. Did you do the number crunching showing the CO2 level was 365-410ppm for years? Did you even get that off a peer reviewed source? In fact let me ask you a personal question. I believe what I do based off of what I have seen in my classes, and how that matches up to the peer reviewed journals and experiments by experts on the subject. I've seen the formulas, and I've seen where at least some of the math has come from. Have you seen a single formula or peer reviewed work to base your assumptions on? Or did you just go to a site that threw out numbers you liked without seeing any of the math behind them with no peer review to validate them?

Ughi96f27DRNWngCoAEC.8MrZmhtQolT8Nle-fj9tBX		5	2017-01-15 20:52:33	KingMonogatari	Lee S. CO2 hasn't passed 400ppm since 25 million years ago. Somehow I doubt that's insignificant, but I'll humor you. It's not affecting our atmosphere then? I guess that must be why most climate studies done by experts and peer reviewed (over 90%) believe in man made climate change. Yeah, one study might be wrong... but 90% of them? If I went to over 100 doctors and over 90% of them said something was wrong with me, would I not be a fool to say I'm perfectly ok? Even if no symptoms are immediately showing, that doesn't mean they won't be further down the line. I mean even stuff as serious as cancer can be asymptomatic until later stages. Say what you want, but I'll believe the experts who have spent years in this field. And the math that I have seen (from physics, thermodynamics, chemistry, and astrophysics) only backs them up. But sure, just knock something down that's founded on well proved principals of numerous sciences. If all those scientific laws suddenly prove false then I'll believe you. Until then, have fun with you're *working fan or liquid-cooled* computer, in your *working air conditioned or heated* home, maybe get some food out of your *working refrigerator*, and let me know when all of them stop following the laws of physics too.

KingMonogatari Then your "math" was flawed. 400ppm of CO2 in our atmosphere is nowhere near enough to have any detectable change on our temperatures. There would have to be MANY times that ammount to influence it in the slightest. It's just not a significant enough concentration to have any meaningful influence. There are literally hundreds of factors that contribute to temperature changes on this planet, and the current levels of CO2 are WAY down that list...

Ughi96f27DRNWngCoAEC.8MrZmhtQolT8NX3LcUWDgH		1	2017-01-09 19:34:54	KingMonogatari	Dr Boggle It should also be noted that our global average temperature is almost 1 degree above the 1990 average. This shouldn't happen during a period of an ice age. In fact studies show that the average was likely under that amount for most of history as far back as 20,000 BCE with only one other major warming period that went over the 1990 average. And that one was much more gradual over hundreds of years. Now I will state that these are just estimates since we didn't have the measuring technology we have today. But a lot of the studies today showing the amount of CO2 emission and how that affects world temperature are much more accurate. Interesting enough odd changes in weather patterns can actually be signs of climate change in either direction. (not necessarily drastic weather changes, just odd ones. Like deserts suddenly getting snow. I mean they can be drastic, but weather is hard to predict like that) I can see why people might have a hard time believing this without seeing how it works, so here's a simple step by step. If the entire planet cools or heats, will the temp change be even across the whole planet? No, some places will heat/cool more and faster than others. So now we have a change in temp in some places that are different than others. A change in temperature will also invoke a change in pressure, what will the sudden temp and pressure changes cause? A change in wind and weather patterns. This can actually cause some areas to be colder/warmer even if the global temperature is going in the other direction. Think if that's a little confusing, think of it this way. Year 1 area A is 50 F and area B is 50 F. The average temp of A and B in Year 1 is 50 F.. Year 2 A is 45 F and B is 55 F due to natural weather changes. The average temp of Year 2 is still 50 F. Now lets introduce global warming Year 3 area A is 43 F and area B is 59 F. The average temp of Year 3 is 51 F. Notice how despite the fact that area A is colder in Year 3 the average temperature is still higher. This was only two areas. Imagine how this affects a fluid, ever changing, connected system that is our world's atmosphere. While we can now accurately measure temperature, we can't always tell how the changes will affect this absolutely massive system. That's why people freak out. Because we honestly don't know how bad the effect can be.	UCFWLp-LhZYqZQ4jMc7PnQPQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFWLp-LhZYqZQ4jMc7PnQPQ	1	Ughi96f27DRNWngCoAEC	KELLSONIC

You half one, you half the other. But it could be exponential or any other form of increase/decrease. That completely changes how you have to look at the problem. I honestly don't know if the individual output of a person is linear to total CO2 output so I can't say for sure, but I can make a hypothesis that based on how power distribution works I doubt it would be. Also you stated earlier, a one child policy. Not a sudden halving of the population. I mean yeah, if you took such a big chunk of people away it would probably have an effect, but a one child policy wouldn't even guarantee a population drop, just that it doesn't rise really fast. The only effective way to take a bunch of the population away would to either ship them to space (which we have no planets in our solar system that are currently inhabitable with current technology. Who knows though, we might finally figure out how to effectively colonize Mars soon) or kill them... which is kind of a drastic option. Not one I would want anyone to use.

Our infrastructure is already set up to expect new houses to be built, products to be made, and electricity to be produced all without falling outside the ever stricter emission and pollutant restraints. We are also already so far above our natural overpopulation point (we can do this because humans continuously find non-natural or semi-natural means to keep giving ourselves resources we otherwise wouldn't have. i.e. recycling, farming, ranching, genetic modification of plants, etc.) that a few more people wouldn't significantly impact our emissions. Would they go up? Yes, of course they would. Would a one child policy significantly reduce our Carbon footprint? Not as much as you might think. Much better and more effective ways would just be more research in to developing new forms of green energy and/or making our current methods cheaper and more accessible.

Global warming as the direct result of emission is at best a 300 year problem. What I mean is that in 300 years if we stay on our current pace we will have used up all of the fossil fuels on the planet. The co2 in the atmosphere doesn't stay there. AS it is a heavier then the other gases in the atmosphere. It will eventually be absorbed into the ocean or  mineralize. That process could take a millennium. After that, well as George R.R Martin puts it, "Winter is Coming". Here some reading for those interested. https://www.technologyreview.com/s/416786/global-warming-vs-the-next-ice-age/ We need a complete solution to a multi-generational problem. I'm sick and tired of people looking at the immediate negative affects and stopping there. We that are alive right now will not be affect that much by this. Our children children children children children children will be the ones to begin really feeling this. Us, the ones here and now, can lay the ground work. I know we can take on such a project.

Also I saw this math in Astrophysics, so it's not even like I was swayed by climate change opinions. I just looked at the math and went, "wait... this is happening to Earth too". We were going over how different things can affect a planet's temperature. One of which was greenhouse gasses. Plug different numbers in for Earth and you can see how adding any amount of CO2 to the atmosphere will affect the temperature... and we add a lot. In fact if you've ever heard someone say something along the lines of "We passed the 'Point of No Return' a long time ago," they're actually right. Although the term is made to sound much scarier than it is. Simply put the infamous "point of no return" is when enough greenhouse gasses are in the atmosphere that heat trapped has a very large effect, and adding only small amounts of CO2 after this point will significantly increase the amount of energy kept by the sun. So not as scary as the name implies, but still something to realize is bad to pass. If you want specifics I'd have to go find those old notes, but the math is there. Or you could look it up yourself And this isn't percentages or likelihood. This is set mathematics. Arguing against this is essentially arguing against 2+2=4. The truth is that we do in fact have a significant effect on our environment that's going in the negative direction. Though, like Adam said in the video, what we don't know is how bad it will be. And that's the scariest part.	UCFWLp-LhZYqZQ4jMc7PnQPQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFWLp-LhZYqZQ4jMc7PnQPQ	1	Ughi96f27DRNWngCoAEC	KELLSONIC

Ugh7bab8Hau2SHgCoAEC.8MrZly8Dtbe8i3dbkIJ_mS		0	2018-06-29 04:54:00	MischievousMoo	I think that older people, like parents, are more likely to believe that climate change is fake than younger people. Those beliefs are going into children. I think older people are more likely to believe that climate change is fake because schools are teaching kids about climate change, older generations are more traditional, so they are more likely to deny change, older people are more likely to die sooner, and older generations are more likely to be in the Republican party. People in the Republican party tend to believe climate change is fake or not man-made. Not all Republicans deny climate change or claim that it's just natural, but more Republicans than Liberals think climate change is fake. It's a shame since climate science shouldn't be political. I think we need to teach older generations that climate change is real and also younger generations. But older generations have more people that deny climate change.

Its not just the atmosphere that has gotten warmer, the oceans temperature has been rising this last century as well. It is true that to say the world will end is over-dramatic, that is not what any climate scientists are saying, also the atmosphere is not "decaying" I have no idea where you got that idea from. The data merely says the Earth is warming, it has already warmed by 2 degrees Fahrenheit from 1950 levels. This won't end all life but many species will and already are going extinct from these changes. Humans probably will not go extinct but it will be expensive to combat the changes rising temperatures will cause such as more powerful weather, rising sea levels and tropical diseases being able to move farther north. If you want to look at some of the evidence of climate change here are a few sources https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/monitoring-references/faq/indicators.php https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/climate-change-evidence-causes/basics-of-climate-change/ https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/	UC1LvAvzKJD3NEsoQW67L83Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1LvAvzKJD3NEsoQW67L83Q	1	Ugh7bab8Hau2SHgCoAEC	Joseph Harding

Its easy to blame it all on humans but its not their fault. they hold a part in it but so does everyone. hell coe farts release millions of gallons of co2 into the atmosphere quite frequently but noones blaming the cows. but aside from that its not that we're just releasing gas, we're getting rid of the things that soak up the co2 so more of it has nowhere else to go but up. and Thats because the population is constantly increasing and we have to get rid of plant life to make space. there is absolutely no way to stop it because it was going to happen with or without hunan help. but in order to slow it down noticably you'd hve to sybstantially decrease the human population and replant the lost vegitation quickly. you could also try to make people "go green" but both of these are extremely unlikely.

The levels of CO2 increasing is caused by humans so I am not sure what you mean by that. There are many other feedback loops that are amplifying that effect such as the melting of methane deposits and the melting of reflective sea ice but the CO2 problem was what got that warming started and is due to the burning of fossil fuels.

Ugh7bab8Hau2SHgCoAEC.8MrZly8Dtbe8_8wIVBj7KI		2	2017-11-19 13:30:54	Richard Lock	"The Earth needs to warm up a little in order to regulate its temperature" What does that actually mean? The Earth doesn't warm up because it feels like it. It warms up because something forces it to. Hence the term "climate forcing". "I don't believe its caused mainly by humans". Correct, what's causing the planet to warm is increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. "The plants will kick in and cool it down again". Well the planet was far warmer say for example during the time of the dinosaurs due to far higher levels of CO2 in the atmosphere than today. Then over millions of years, trees soaked up some of the CO2, decomposed into coal and that CO2 was "locked" underground. Now we are returning that same CO2 back into the atmosphere at a rate a million times faster than it was drawn out. The weathering process also draws CO2 out of the atmosphere but again, this process takes millions of years to have any noticeable effect.

The word theory in science does not mean an educated guess, that's what a hypothesis is. A theory is an explanation for an observation. A theory is the highest rank an explanation can achieve, a Law is a completely different thing all together. A law is simply a series of observations, such as two objects with mass attract each other at a certain rate. If enough observations of a phenomena is made that you can predict it behavior than it is made into a law like the law of Universal Gravitation or Maxwell's Field Equations. But these laws are simply equations that show *what* happens, they make no attempt to explain the mechanism by which this phenomena function. That is the realm of theory. So you have both the Law which says what happens and a theory that explains how it happens, for example the Law of Universal Gravitation which says mass attract other mass at a specific rate and the Theory of General Relativity which explain the reason mass does this is because it curves space time around it. One is not better than the other, they just describe two different things.	UC1LvAvzKJD3NEsoQW67L83Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1LvAvzKJD3NEsoQW67L83Q	1	Ugh7bab8Hau2SHgCoAEC	Joseph Harding

While I _know_ Climate change is real, I don't believe its caused mainly by humans. For example: we survived _Two_ Ice ages, in all human history, and we're technically still in one. The Earth needs to warm up a little in order to regulate its temperature, then when it gets too hot, the plants will kick in and cool it down again, then when it gets too cold, decomposition, seismic/volcanic activity, etc... will heat it back up, and the cycle continues.

Climate can be, and often is looked at in a localized way. Of course, it can also be viewed in a global way. Weather is typically thought of as localized, but can be thought of as global, but it is a bit of a stretch. Think of weather/climate in a time context. weather is CURRENT conditions for a given area, whereas climate is AVERAGE conditions for a given area, as recorded over time.

However, it is also important to point out that, while Antarctica is gaining ice, the rate at which it is gaining ice is decreasing year by year. Once that rate decreases to zero and the antarctic starts to lose land ice, the rate at which the seas are rising will also dramatically increase.

If there is a drought in China, does it mean there is a drought in America? No. If there is a thunderstorm in Africa, does that mean there is also one in Malaysia? No. Weather are localised phenomenon, it is not climate. Climate is the overall trend and weather patterns over a period of time. Climate is like your entire lifespan, weather is like when you have flu, acne, a broken leg, individual events over your life. If you lived for 75 years, we can look back and see the trend of your life, your 'climate' and find the individual diseases and ailments you had, your 'weather'. We can calculate the frequency and weather pattern of your climate over 75 years. This rare snow occurrence in Sahara is not even a meaningful point of data since in that article itself it stated that it last happened in 1979, it's just a rare occurrence that has no correlation to climate change.

You climate changers are so easier to freak out, "oh it's 1 degree warmer, its global warming". There was more co2 during the carbonifferus and the world didn't end then.

Realistically, if we just plant WAY more trees and plants that consume carbon dioxide and put out oxygen it would help way more than wasting money on &#39;carbon credits&#39;. I think pollution is more of a problem than &#39;climate change&#39;. The plasitcs and netting in the oceans are more devastating than carbon dioxide. We need to focus on real pollution.

The much colder ice cream changes the temperature at the back of your throat, which contains many blood vessels, one of which feeds blood into the brain. The headache you get after quickly eating/drinking a cold substance is your body's way of telling you to stop eating or drinking whatever cold substance you are ingesting.

They thought the election was rigged for Hillary to win. I am not saying trump supporters are dumb idiotic fools.

Why do you think that is? They don&#39;t want the smart brave bold young to go see for themselves the secret land (huge) that is down there. They certainly don&#39;t want you believing that the earth is flat. They know it&#39;s flat but they can control you more if you believe it is a sphere. That&#39;s why they make fun of flat earthers. They know you don&#39;t want to be mocked. It feels &#39;awkward&#39;. The Truman Show was trying to tell you. Check out Matt Boylan out Matt Powerland. He has a YouTube channel. He used to work for NASA as a realist type artist. They deny this as he broke with protocol by telling the public who will listen, what he knows. The only reason you believe it&#39;s a sphere /ball is because they hammered it into you as a child in primary school. This is a movement. Beware of the fake half truths flat earth groups who are there to confuse you. What kind of mind do you have? Are you going to research it or join your friends who are taught it&#39;s a hoax. Be dauntless.	UCKV8LCG9T4WzILVo8nvFQiw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKV8LCG9T4WzILVo8nvFQiw	0

Explain the fact that when examining ice core samples they it shows that CO2 levels FOLLOW the increase in temperature not precede it. You forgot to mention that NASA says that there has been no temperature change in approx. 18 years. The have a word for it. They call it the Pause.

Once the climate stabilizes there will be several more times arable land in regions that were previously too cold (siberia for example) The bad news is there will be a massive refugee crisis from regions where warming will be detrimental (africa/middle east) but humanity overall would benefit. Im more worried about the toxins we put in the air over the climate changing. But dont take it from me. Im not an expert, just a nerd.

There is something we can do about it. there are clean energy sources out there.

I follow a very good youtuber who is a scientist and does an excellent job of explaining climate change. That being said 1.)Climate Change is undoubtedly happening. 2.)We don't know for sure how much humans are contributing to it. 3.)The consequences are very real, like our oceans turning acidic. Weather it is man made or not is irrelevant, it's happening, and if we don't find a way to slow, stop, or reverse it our planet is going to become uninhabitable to humans.

Yea, climate change is real, but its been real for billions of years. We&#39;re pretty sure there was an ice age sometime in those billions of years.

Many people conflate the pollution issue with global warming and climate change. Although these two issues are often put together they are two separate issues. We need to battle pollution more than &quot;climate change&quot;. Pollution causes many diseases and other things that are a more immediate danger to humans than a climate shift. Recently is has come out that global warming is happening but at a much slower pace than previously thought. The &quot;climate change&quot; movement/agenda since it has been pushed by NATO has been responsible for the greatest transfer of wealth in the worlds history. Im not saying climate science is fake but people over react to some things and dont realize that the people&#39;s wealth/freedom is at stake over something that is being fought wrongly. Our current climate issues are due to overpopulation and pollution due to overpopulation. It is man-made but not solely a product of industrialization but more so overpopulation. No amount of money or resource can ethically/humanly address this issue.	UCzqud5UvL5zU3xj1wd1oYgg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzqud5UvL5zU3xj1wd1oYgg	0

Remember when Wikileaks released all that stuff about the climate scientists have warming built into their computers, so it would show it whether it happened or not? How about Al Gore's Inconvenient Truth? It's been 10 years and none of the catastrophes he predicted have happened. "Within 10 years!" He boldly predicted... He lives in a mansion and practices none of what he preaches. We don't know what the climate does. Accurate records have only existed a very short time, and all science has proved is that the earth has been a lot hotter than it is now. I think everyone needs to look at this "Global Warming," er, "climate change," with a skeptical eye. True science comes up with a theory and does all it can to prove it wrong, not build it into the model then brow beat everyone into going along with it.

UggGnL1BxRTJrXgCoAEC.8MrC7sLtVdQ8Ms77AHYcgy		7	2016-12-24 12:39:46	The Rickest Rick	The earth is far too dynamic to simply say "the debate is over." The medieval warm period was warmer than the earth is now and there was no cars or coal burning then. Everything from the shape of the earths orbit around the sun to how many fires don't burn as wild as they used to figures into this. The earth is too big and there are too many things going on to simply say man has destroyed the planet by burning fossil fuels. It is disingenuous and arrogant to make these claims with so much evidence that says climate change (if it is at all) is a naturally occurring cycle of the earth. Look at history for examples. In the early 1800 a volcano erupted in Southeast Asia. It was so massive that it disrupted weather patterns across the earth, causing regular snowfalls in North America as late as June. I don't have fancy annotations popping up when I talk, but dig deeper and you'll find that there is a plurality of evidence that shows the earth has been cooling the last 20 years instead of getting warmer. In the 1970's the claimed we were headed for another ice age. When this many politicians go for something so hard and try making new taxes on so many things, I think we should all take a step back and ask that simplest of questions, "why?" Edited: I spelt oolong instead of cooling. Where were you on that one autocorrect?

Furthermore, seismic events often have an impact on other meteorlogical systems, particularly volcanoes, which contain a cooling agent. In big enough quantities, such as 1995 Mt Pinatubo, this can actually lead to a cooling effect, though obviously nothing large enough to counter the damage of global warming in the long run.

I will try to put it in the most basic terms: Global Warming exists and without it life on earth would not be able to exist. Our atmosphere traps heat within the earth, because without it heat would escape into space and we would be stuck on a giant clump of ice. Like Mars. With me so far? The stuff that traps the heat in the atmosphere and deflects it back down to earth are called Green House Gases. Y'know the stuff we pump out the back of cars and from power stations. If we put more of this stuff up into the atmosphere, then more heat is trapped and viola: The planet heats up more. What part of this is so hard to understand? When the planet heats up, what is one material which is going to melt in vast quantities when this happens?... Ice! What happens when the sea level rises because of all this extra water? You end up knee deep in water. Also why are you comparing it to "Left politics". The political spectrum has nothing to do with Global Warming. The "Right" in the USA ar only mainly saying it doesn't exist because half of them are paid off by the Kochs brothers: Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush etc... Donald Trump doesn't count... he is just a moron. If we suddenly stopped using fossil fuels and switched to nuclear and renewables I can guaruntee you that things "would not suck as much". I wouldn't even say that I am on the Left...	UCBH6zRaLNYL0n35fxdeV_lA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBH6zRaLNYL0n35fxdeV_lA	1	UgiIB_OVQt6-IXgCoAEC	Googly Moogly

UgiIB_OVQt6-IXgCoAEC.8MrAcSPqixk8N9nLwft9Ly		0	2016-12-31 18:43:51	Alex Schmidt	This is my copy and paste comment because I don't have time to type this out repeatedly. So I'll be covering the main points. #1 sea level rise. First we're going to be looking at the Arctic and from geography class you know it is floating sea ice. Now using the most basic of high school physics we can know that ice displaces water. This means that even if the Arctic melted 100% it wouldn't raise sea levels at all. Now over to the Antarctic which is a completely different story as it is land mass covered in ice and would raise sea levels if it were to melt. However even NASA who has been more than just questionable about there integrity on AGW, they have been sued for refusing to release raw data and for producing false papers. And even they admit that the Antarctic is growing by 82 billions tons per year. #2 Now let's look at CO2 itself. And by the way this is where the 97% consensus comes from, 97% of scientists agree that CO2 warms the earths temperature but the debate is climate sensitivity and I will now explain. Now a lot of the numbers you hear are from the IPCC, and this is a problem because this is not a peer reviewed paper. But if you just look at the IPCC they say you'll get 6 degrees F warming per doubling of CO2. However when you look at the peer reviewed studies almost every paper you look at will say you will get between 1-1.5 degrees F warming per doubling of CO2. This is a massive difference and if you go by the peer reviewed science then at the rate we're going now we have nothing to worry about. #3 But the earth is still warming and has been since the last ice age at a constant rate. And graphs like the hockey stick take a jump in the temperature and make it seem abnormal. If you respond to this without throwing childish insults chances are I'll respond but if you're just going to be a troll I'm out.

For the South Pacific thing, that is my bad, I should have researched it further, but that doesn't undermine anything else.

France's heatwave claimed 15,000 lives because France's idiotic policies produced brownouts and people were packed into apartments with no A/C. And counting economic loss is ridiculous. Of course a hurricane striking a city in 2005 is going to cause more economic damage than, for example, the much bigger one in 1723. 2004 was not the first recorded hurricane in the South Atlantic--which for most of even modern history was pretty dang unobserved--as there was at least one in 1991.

(previous record 21:12) 6) Hurricane Vince: A hurricane in a region out of Hurricane risk. 7)The Müchener Rück research group record a steady upward trend in natural disasters, particularly flooding and tropical storms, since 1950. 8) The same trend is repeated on a closer look at India, which has also experienced a rapid increase in tropical storms, extreme weather (droughts) and flooding since 1980.

I thought that was obvious from its tone. As for wild fires, I'm no expert in ones in California or Australia, but in the Amazon, Congo and Borneo they are due to people deliberately burning the forest to clear the way for farmland and cattle grazing. As well as global warming, which decreases precipitation in the area, leading to drier leaves and the greater likelihood of the trees catching fire.

One of the things you can look at is cyclone/hurricane frequency. We're not getting more of them, or drought. We're getting more wildfires, but that's because of liberal policies that don't allow us to clear brush anymore and conscious decisions to let them keep burning. It's kinda cute that we're supposed to hand over more control to the government or the evil capitalists will crank out more CO2--but letting a forest fire wipe out a couple hundred square miles of timber is OK, because that's "natural."

Cyclones require a certain ocean temperature to form (I believe around 27 degrees Celsius) so rising sea temperature as a result of global warming would lead to further hurricanes/cyclones. Drought is already becoming more common because of course higher temperatures disrupt existing weather patterns and higher pressure weather bands becoming more frequent. Forest fires are also more likely to become more frequent. flooding is also more likely to occur due to thermal expansion of the ocean leading to greater amounts of storm surges.

As I noted before, unless you're quite deliberately not getting the point, he was pretty obviously trying to connect "inbred cousin fuckers" to people who disagree with him. "Simply mocking someone is not an ad hominem." Mocking somebody in direct connection to their argument, in a blatant attempt to connect the two, on the other hand, is. We've been over this before--the issue ins't that I don't understand you but that your claim is false. "I rather like being proven wrong, it means I learned something. " Then I guess today's your lucky day.... several times over. "So look at that, wrong about something yet again." Except that you haven't learned something yet, or you wouldn't keep making the same false claims. "You, however, sound like the type that can't deal with being wrong..." And it sounds a bit like you're making personal attacks in lieu of facts. .... say, isn't there a name for that? "And at the moment, you are keeping at it despite being obviously wrong, sooooo... maybe stop while you can?" Little hint for you. Saying "you're wrong" doesn't actually make somebody wrong--just like saying "I proved it" doesn't actually mean you proved something. In this case, my assessment is a pretty straightforward observation of the obvious, and I'm not going to pretend that up is down simply because somebody on the internet, without a shred of proof, tells me "you're wrong and I proved it."

Nothing stopped anyone from voting for any of them, true, but with the current state of politics in the US, the only *viable* parties are Democratic and Republican. And with those two.. Trump was the only real choice. *Subpar* for sure. But while subpar, he was infinitely more qualified than Hillary. I used to be in the military, and had a security clearance to go with it. And if she can't even successfully handle something as brain-dead-simple as a security clearance.. Handing her the keys to this nation is a no-go.

You applied a standard to them that you refuse to apply to yourself. Perhaps they think the research that backs it *not* existing is also easily researchable.

Chemtrails contain Aluminium, Strontium, Silver Iodine, Barium etc. Weather modification experimentation has been used since before 1960&#39;s. You only need to look up in the sky to see the changes. Skies once bright blue are now pale. Fluffy clouds are streaks. Contrails are thin jet fuel emissions that only last a few minutes max. Chemtrails leave a line across the sky that begins to spread. The whole idea is to block out the sun, or reflect heat back with the Aluminium nano sized particles, but unfortunately the chemicals used are toxic. We need the sun for survival and biodiversity. Chemtrails need to be stopped.	UC2jP3nYEYwHoe88EdHyIHgw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2jP3nYEYwHoe88EdHyIHgw	0

Basically this is through the process of growing forests carbon dioxide is stored and removed through the atmosphere due to plant respiration. This has many benefits including improved air, water, wildlife, aesthetic, and economic values. Importantly this greatly encourages timber production, and with the help of modern construction methods can greatly reduce the use of other building materials like steel or concrete; which have no carbon storage benefits and produce mass amounts of carbon dioxide. I just thought I&#39;d share this because a lot of people talk about switching to alternative fuels to combat climate change, but there are a lot more methods which you can combat climate change with including: Sustainable agriculture, fishing, forestry methods, and restoration of degraded ecosystems and habitats are just some other examples.

Green energy will come when the technology can win in the free market. Global warming is being used as a tool for carbon offset taxation. It will not prevent pollution, it will only prevent economic growth in the countries who enforce it. Countries like China will exploit this, they will frack, burn coal and use oil. They will crush the tree hugging countries who avoid it.	UCt4tuYFzE5_m-zeMtSJIALQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt4tuYFzE5_m-zeMtSJIALQ	0

Those companies can then purchase &quot;carbon credits&quot; that permit those companies to release the same level of CO2. It&#39;s all about the money people. When people aren&#39;t buying into the lie, the left changes the name of it. Global warming becomes climate change. Gun control legislation becomes gun safety legislation, and so on.

Climate change is something that can be roughly estimated given previous statistics, while natural occurrences like hurricanes can't really be foreseen. There is, however an evident correlation to rising global temperatures and a change in weather, so the numbers are always changing.

From a couple of your links, I tracked the source of the figure "51%" to The Worldwatch Institute: "Livestock and Climate Change": http://www.worldwatch.org/files/pdf/Livestock%20and%20Climate%20Change.pdf The main purpose of that article is to criticise a previous article from FAO/IPCC that used the term 18%, and it does so on several points. However, I did also find some criticism against Worldwatch's article. One big factor in the article is that it pushes the notion that we should calculate global warming potential of methane as having a CO2e factor of 75 over 20 years instead of factor 25 or 30 over 100 years. However, according to a criticising article, the Worldwatch Institute would have failed to adjust the GWP of _other_ methane sources in the same way. http://www.vegan.com/articles/environment/a-sympathetic-but-skeptical-look-at-goodland-and-anhangs-livestock-and-climate-change/ Therefore, the figure "51%" might be a bit too high. But it is definitely higher than 30%. I would say at least 1/3, most likely around 40%. Even a third is incredibly huge though.

I have read many articles of the causes of global warming but never such a high figure for animal agriculture, not even when indirect sources are included, such as land clearance, ploughing, transports etc. What is your source? I mentioned cement-production because it is a huge source of CO2 that most people don't know about. It is often under the caption of "industry" or "buildings". At least in my country a cement producer is the fourth largest industrial polluter after an oil refinery and two steel mills.

Don&#39;t tell me the climate is cyclical and we have recorded numerous amounts of cooling and heating periods throughout the ages? I mean carbon is obviously at fault right? I mean 99% of scientists in climate studies agree... What that statistic came from nowhere in is absolutely false. But solar and wind energy is really good... Oh no, we couldn&#39;t even power a city with all the solar, wind, and hydro power on earth. But electric? Nope most of that is produced from burning coal anyway. Hmm...

First point: misinterpreted; the numbers were revised to weed out inaccuracies Second point: with the excessive cutting down of forests, we may not have enough plants to absorb carbon dioxide Third point: we are supposed to be in a period of cooling right now, but various environmentally destructive human actions have interrupted the cycle of heating and cooling (read: we ****ed up) Fourth point: didn't actually happen; this is another misinterpretation of data optimization (read: making raw data human-readable) Fifth point: God told us to use, but we shouldn't abuse. Clearly "using" until God's creations are destroyed isn't something that He would approve of, right? I'm Christian, yet I believe that global warming right now is mainly caused by mankind's greed and that this is divine punishment for that. Wouldn't look too out of place in the Bible, frankly.

Trump	To anyone around the world wondering why americans are so dumb about climate change, let me just say most younger americans are educated on the matter and know it is happening because we know how to separate beliefs and opinions from empirical facts. Secondly its a big contentious issue here because the political establishment is payed by special interest to deny it to benefit large corporations. Many older americans, not all, see it as debatable because they were never educated about it for one and two because of the political establishment making it into an political issue. because of this the arguments against climate change have gotten equal coverage in the media as the arguments for it. Because it has become politicized people in the US have more so backed their political bias. Most americans dont care to educate themselves on the matter because they feel as though its not happening because it snowed the other day or some reason to make them not worry about it so they can live there lives. They are usually very distant from the people being affected so they dont care to find out.	UCa8qJS3SYOasN4WUJKncvhQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa8qJS3SYOasN4WUJKncvhQ	0

Its actually mass extinction due to the destruction of the food chain. Animals and Plants unable to adapt to a rapidly changing biosphere. Ecosystems have a delicate balance and changes in temperature, weather patterns and sea level are far more detrimental to them than to us. I like how no one ever talks about this. The problem isnt that the climate is changing, climate always changes. Its just happening at an accelerated pace without influence from factors like large scale volcanic activity, extraterrestrial bodies colliding with the planet, significant increases in solar output, or earths position in relation to the sun. The overwhelming majority of research done by our most highly educated and trusted scientists has pointed to human influence as the cause yet everyone who took a high school science class thinks they know better... smh. The only reason why ppl think this way is because of the media and the internet. Ppl dont like to accept information that challenges their beliefs.

Climate change is part of natural cycle that happens over a multi-century period. Looking at history, we can see where "Global warming" has happened in the past, and were the earth has cooled off before. The Earth's orbit isn't circular, but elliptical, and it "wobbles." This changes weather patterns from decade to decade.	UCUET4LmpmL4NWKx459TqwSQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUET4LmpmL4NWKx459TqwSQ	1	UgjztPBW6Az-vHgCoAEC	Donald J. Trump

A 2 degree rise from what? Such as most of these guys will show you a temperature graph depicting a small slice of time. Yet if you look at a chart depicting temperatures going back hundreds, or even more so thousands of years, you will see that we are in a perfectly normal part of a rise and fall in temps that the earth goes through all on its very own.

And after the nuclear winter has passed, man&#39;s production of green house gasses will fall to near zero and stay that way for a considerable time which will give the Earth plenty of time to heal itself - look at the area around Chernobyl. Trump has been elected and is already talking of increasing the nuclear arms race. It&#39;s now a race to the finish.

Nothing out of the normal is happening to the Earth&#39;s climate. I&#39;m old enough to remember the climate scares of the 70&#39;s, when they all said the planet was going to go through an ice age because of pollutants in the environment.

I also understand the correlation between the rising CO2 levels and the increased temperature, but what about the fact that humanity was born in an ice age. We have just come out of an ice age and is it possible that the increased heating is inevitable? I heard that there were times in the earth&#39;s history where the average temperature was even hotter than it currently is, but man-made carbon emissions didn&#39;t occur until recently. Also the cold water is able to retain CO2 much more efficiently than warm water making the evidence at the Vostok ice core possibly questionable. Basically what I&#39;m asking is that is it possible that the rapid heating may be another phase of the milankovitch cycle?

Let me explain. Milankovitch cycles cause variations of a few degrees (the last glacial period was 9 °C cooler than nowadays) over period of dozens of thousands of years (as we've just said), whereas the change we're now observing started more or less in the latter half of the 20th century, because only then did man-made emissions actually rise so much that they started influencing the world's climate. The fact that such an incredible heating (believe it or not, 0.9 °C is a lot on a world-wide scale) happened in such a little period is one of the many proves that the heating isn't natural. The world's temperatures, along our planet's history, have changed gradually and slowly, certainly not by full degrees in periods of decades. Yes, the temperature of the Earth has been much, much hotter than it currently is. 650 million years old the Earth was completely covered by ice (see "Snowball-Earth theory"), and 350 million years later, when the dinosaurs dominated the planet, world-wide temperatures were up to 15 °C hotter than now. That, nevertheless, was not the world we're used to. There was absolutely no ice on Earth and the fauna and flora were much different, and I don't think we humans would find such a place very comfortable. The cold water-warm water problem you raised is important: what's happening is that, since the Earth's temperatures are rising, the oceans' temperature are too, and since warm water retains gases less efficiently than cooler water, the hotter the seas get the more they tend to emit greenhouse gases that are contained within them as solutes, thereby further increasing the greenhouse effect. That's known as "positive feedback loop". Believe me, the science of climate change is absolutely certain. It's true that it's hard to make predictions, and that's due to the extreme complexity of our world's climate system, but we know that the climate is changing and we know why. The fact that we aren't capable of efficiently predicting the magnitude of the changes is irrelevant. Now, I could speak about this issues for HOURS, I have tons of info and researches piled around my bedroom and in my computer, and I'll speak about it with you if you are interested. Just let me know! However, please, don't let your opinion be affected by non-scientifical arguments. This is too crucial a topic to be misunderstood. Bye!

France has been doing wonders with nuclear energy, even finding a way to use its waste to create even MORE energy. But the problem is, countries like the United States know how to use and reuse these resources, they are just not willing to put in the money or effort to do so. Think about it like this, let&#39;s say you are in the wild, all you have to eat are 5 bags of chips. You eat one bag, and tell yourself, &quot;I don&#39;t have to hunt yet, I have 4 bags left!&quot; You eat another. &quot;I don&#39;t have to hunt yet, I have 3 bags left!&quot; You eat the rest of the bags and realize you have to find food, problem is you can&#39;t find any. Now let&#39;s replace you with the United States in this situation, and the bags of chips with our Uranium supply. We need to stop using our resources at such a quick rate, and if we can do so, we can live off of Nuclear Energy for centuries to come, and it&#39;s much much better than fossil fuels.

It isn't like the earth will explode when it hits the 2 degree increase. There isn't "that day" when climate change kills us all. It is a change in the climate over time, and the 2 degree mark will significantly increase the rate at which is does.

Just because one institute has data that September 2016 has a higher ice extent from the past ten years, doesn't mean that much. It doesn't include data from other institutions, and even the the source they gave clearly indicates the trend of Arctic ice decline since 1979. The source they used for that data knows climate change is happening, but I guess they forgot to mention that. And the 'government' didn't skew data, it was a select institution that supposedly skewed the data. The UEACRU isn't the only place that researches climate change, and it was cleared of fraudulent activity and scientific misconduct by every committee that investigated it. It takes alot more to disprove climate change.	UCtt1gByuuQKG-e4j5rGUDVA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtt1gByuuQKG-e4j5rGUDVA	1	Ugh2vg1dBHh8xXgCoAEC	Christian Lindsey

The media is firmly in the Left's pockets, and they repeated the same old "the world will fry if you don't overthrow capitalism" line. Second, no. Scientists are still quite divided on whether global warming is occurring, how much (if any) of it is due to humans if it is occurring, and whether (if it's happening) it will be good or bad. The 97% is a myth. And third, no. They get a hell of a lot of benefit.

We've known about the greenhouse effect since Fourier isolated the infrared bands in the hydrogen spectra and realised that the industrial revolution could have some unintended consequences . Since the late 1870s scientists have been consistently warning about the greenhouse effect, so this "But 30 years ago scientists said the oposite" thing is complete nonsense.

Even his "proof that we weren't worried about cooling" talks about the climate changing, not warming. Along with a long series of other ridiculous doomsday scenarios that didn't remotely come true. In their sidebar, "Popular Literature of the Era," "For example, the following are titles from two New York Times articles: “Scientists ask why world climate is changing; major cooling may be ahead” (Sullivan 1975a) and “Warming trend seen in climate; two articles counter view that cold period is due” (Sullivan 1975b). The most frequently cited magazine articles are described below. While these articles described the past climate and a distant future of another ice age, the following is a review only of their decadal-to-century-scale global temperature projections. Science Digest’s 1973 article “Brace yourself for another Ice Age” (Colligan 1973) primarily focused on ice ages and global cooling, with the warning that “the end of the present interglacial period is due ‘soon.’” However, it clarified that “‘soon’ in the context of the world’s geological time scale could mean anything from two centuries to 2,000 years, but not within the lifetime of anyone now alive.” The article also mentioned that “scientists seem to think that a little more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could warm things up a good deal.” Time Magazine (1974) ominously worried that “climatological Cassandras are becoming increasingly apprehensive, for the weather aberrations they are studying may be the harbinger of another ice age.” However, only one scientist was indicated by name issuing any sort of projection: “Some scientists like Donald Oilman, chief of the National Weather Service’s long-range-prediction group, think that the cooling trend may be only temporary.” Science News’1975 article “Climate change: Chilling possibilities” (Douglas 1975) mainly discussed the new findings that raised the possibility of “the approach of a full-blown 10,000-year ice age.” However, it also put these results into perspective with statements such as “the cooling trend observed since 1940 is real enough . . . but not enough is known about the underlying causes to justify any sort of extrapolation,” and “by the turn of the century, enough carbon dioxide will have been put into the atmosphere to raise the temperature of earth half a degree.” The 1975 Newsweek article (Gwynne 1975) quotes four scientists by name and none of them offered a projection of the future; three discussed observations of the recent cooling..." Yes, we were being told that the earth would get colder.	UCIgbC8Be95WeJpGhzh36TEw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIgbC8Be95WeJpGhzh36TEw	1	UghPgvEyHkGG7HgCoAEC	Barackoli

If you noticed the scientist said could happen not will happen. America is making huge leaps in reducing green house gasses. <br /><br />My question is what can we do about it? <br />Stop driving? yea thats gonna happen. <br /><br />Solar and wind are a sustainable future. But we need time to implement them. <br /><br />World has been 10 degrees hotter in the distant past. There were many living creaturrs at that time. Im sure the human race will be fine.

At the rate of current warming most creatures will not survive, and I agree that humans will survive, we are without a doubt the most adaptable species but do we really want to live in a world where we are the only species? Not to mention the massive amount of agriculture land and mass starvation the would be inevitable.

UggaNd-OKYL743gCoAEC	0	0	2016-12-23 20:03:40	Speedstack21	My biggest issue is that there is no proven solution or remedy. <br /><br />Large taxes and fines are levied because &quot;we have to do our part,&quot; but there is no scientific proof that we are gaining traction on slowing down climate change. <br /><br />So it&#39;s great to have a love and appreciation for our environment, but if you don&#39;t think that these environmental companies aren&#39;t making huge profits, and aren&#39;t driven by money, you are kidding yourself. <br /><br />I&#39;m open to the idea that climate change can exist if it&#39;s been proven, but it hasn&#39;t, and for some reason some of the biggest advocates of climate change don&#39;t care about the science or data that it definitively exists, or whether these carbon laws are actually helping. It&#39;s all about the $$$, and you&#39;re being lied to in order for them to get more of it. <br /><br />If you believe in Climate Change and you&#39;ve done enough research to back up your faith, then that&#39;s very credible to support your position. But follow through and also hold these environmental companies and politicians accountable for the money that is being spent on battling climate change. Otherwise it&#39;s all for nothing, and they&#39;ll laugh their way to the bank with your money. <br /><br />I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is that taxing cigarettes won&#39;t find a cure for cancer. It just gives the politicians more money to waste on non cancer issues...	UCXp7OyIPH5MWfMoL3DPzXCw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXp7OyIPH5MWfMoL3DPzXCw	0

My best advice to everyone is to just save and put away right along with them and invest for our cleaner energy because we know what is really going to happen and they can just deny it until the cows stop coming home like the bees did. A society can NOT go back in time and can only become a NEW GREAT not an old great. Making money off of peoples dreams is sickening. People need to suck it up and just learn new trades and jobs and realize that it is hard facts that sometimes life is not fair and we all must put our big adult pants on and switch careers and if it means leaving coal behind it means leaving it behind.

"No, by James O'keefe-y I mean doctored, falsified and presented as truth by a professional propagandist. " Ball, shot, and pocket! "However that still wouldn't explain literally every other scientist around the world." Nor does it need to. Scientists are deeply divided on whether it's man-made, what the results will be, and whether it's happening at all. "And I highly doubt the ''shutting down dissenting papers'' claim, mostly because that sounds suspicionsly close to the peer review process." First, I suggest you look up the actual peer review process. Second, you can doubt it all you want, but they were caught. "As to your other claims 'the pause' was an illusion. Once you account for known variables," Heh. Once you doctor up the numbers, you can make the facts disappear. You were saying something about "doctored, falsified, and presented as truth"? Well, take a look at what that looks like when it actually happens. "And models have actually been very accurate." LOL. You mean the ones that told us that we were all going to fry if we didn't adopt socialism 20 years ago?

If you look at any temperature records for the last ten thousand years you&#39;ll see spikes of Colder periods and much hotter. I&#39;ll try to give you the truth that these two assholes on the screen won&#39;t tell you. On record right now they have a spike in the CO2 content in the atmosphere which barely makes up a quarter of one percent of atmosphere. Scientists are confused of what this will result in to. Politicians just use that to fundraise and say the planet will die. Other scientists say that it might stimulate plant growth on the planet. And others say Earth may have its own way of regulating its own temperature. But these two jerks on the screen.

UghwmRjdjxCjqXgCoAEC	0	0	2016-12-23 17:05:20	RobbyTheRogue	Hello Theory Of Man-made Global warming I have some mail for you called the &quot;vostok ice core samples&quot;(google it) It shows the planet changing it&#39;s temperature well before mankind started burning fossil fuels AND a distinct lag between CO2 levels and rising temperatures, meaning things got hotter and then CO2 levels increased.<br /><br />it also means that the planet may be heating up on it&#39;s own. But you may ask &quot;Why is it doing that?&quot; Well one theory is the planet is still thawing off from the last Ice Age and our planet&#39;s average temperature isn&#39;t what it is now. The fact of the matter is people have taken notice of rising sea levels well before the 17th century and have noticed a CONSISTANT increase. so try guessing how much CO2 would be speeding that process up if all that fossil fuel we were burning was having a catastrophic reaction.<br /><br />Also in closing I would like to point out the Al Gore the founder of this theory burns more fossil fuel then the average millionaire with large gas guzzling cars and flying a private jet to speak out against man-made global warming, now why would he do that if he doesn&#39;t believe what he preaches? Maybe because he wants money.	UC2ellJAtFx6UJFMc69UQYlg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2ellJAtFx6UJFMc69UQYlg	0

Adam...... climate change is one of the natural things planets do. ours does so every 6000 years. carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is not our fault it is normal due to massive influx of oxygen breathing creatures in the past 10,000 years (which is transferred to plants to create oxygen through photosynthesis, reason why it&#39;s hot in foliage enriched environments it is due to the carbon dioxide drain that plants pull) and most carbon emission through factories and machinery is monoxide not dioxide.<br /><br />some might say &quot;how is that better? monoxide is poisonous!&quot; well, Worldwide, the largest source of carbon monoxide is natural in origin, due to photochemical reactions in the troposphere that generate about 5×10^12 kilograms per year.{1} Other natural sources of CO include volcanoes, forest fires, and other forms of combustion. not to mention in the presence of oxygen it will recreate carbon dioxide and thus go into photosynthisis and create oxygen which will be breathed in by all living animals.<br /><br />&quot;did that not prove Adams thesis?&quot; no not exactly. with a influx of carbon dioxide alone, he would be right, but we don&#39;t have just influx of carbon dioxide we have influx of life as well.<br /> more plant&#39;s are cross-breed, dogs and cats are more abundant due to their domestication and use as household pets and humans have increased by a crazy amount.<br /><br /> 200 years ago we numbered less than 1 billion.{2} Recent estimates suggest that 6.5 percent of all people ever born are alive right now.{3} This is the most conspicuous fact about world population growth: for thousands of years, population grew only slowly, but in recent centuries it has jumped dramatically. Between 1900 and 2000 the increase in world population was three times greater than the entire previous history of humanity– an increase from 1.5 to 6.1 billion in just 100 years.<br /><br />global warming is happening whether we like it or not but it&#39;s normal. to say otherwise is to prolong the inevitable by blaming others and lets be honest, what company will stop trying to milk a dollar tree like energy? the answer is when humans stop being materialistic, ergo once we become a civilization worth classifying. to give it a time value another 200 years at-least.<br /><br />&quot;so how does climate change become natural then&quot; through Milankovitch&#39;s Theory, of course!<br /><br />&quot;Milankovitch Theory? who?&quot; The Milankovitch Theory explains the 3 cyclical changes in Earth’s orbit and tilt that cause the climate fluctuations that occur over tens of thousands of years to hundreds of thousands of years. You have learned about these orbital changes in the Temperature over Time module. These fluctuations include changes in the shape (eccentricity) of Earth’s orbit every ~100,000 years, the tilt (obliquity) of Earth’s axis every ~41,000 years, and the wobbling (precession) of Earth’s axis about ~23,000 years. Milankovitch proposed that glacial periods began when the three cycles align to favor an extended period of more solar radiation in the winter and less solar radiation in the summer at a latitude of 65°N. These conditions for the northern latitudes favor somewhat higher temperatures, but also more water vapor in the air – causing more snowfall. A relatively cool summer for the northern latitudes favors less melting of winter snow and glacier formation.{4)<br />citation 1 Weinstock, B.; Niki, H.

Mars needs atmosphere. the plan is to bombard it with carbon dioxide (which is commonly produced by pollutants)<br />solution. bring billions of TONS of coal to mars. (but how?)<br /><br />spacex will have rockets that can carry a hundred people and the ability to return to earth. the price that they expected is 100 000-200 000 USD per person (the median household in US) (this is obviously not the price yet. after a decade maybe. point is it&#39;s cheap. relatively speaking but the important part is encouraging people/businesses to create a colony to mars)<br /><br /><br />even if people on earth get full 100% solar powered. people up in mars should still use coals because it will fasten creating a thick atmosphere in mars, which in turn terraforming mars to a habitable planet. new researchers, businesses, and most importantly of all. USE OF POLLUTANTS IS NOT YET FINISHED. all future usage of pollutants is for space propellants, faster transformation of planets etc.<br /><br />other space companies will rise up to<br />companies for space mining (lots of hard rocks for research and jewel in orbit. [radioactivity depends] ). (and some asteroid can refuel/energize ships)<br />companies for space research<br />companies with sole projects of terraforming planets/moons<br /><br />not immediately and not as the same value as before but we will use all the trillions of dollars that companies have on reserve.<br />and we have to conserve some of em for future space mission.

When they melt, it will lower as ice takes up more space than water. Also, the ozone layer was being damaged years ago be refrigerators that weren&#39;t disposed properly; nowadays the refrigerators we use nowadays don&#39;t damage it, and so it is repairing.water vapour causes the earth to become more insulated rather than CO2. My point is CO2 has little to do with global warming, but more to do with the air becoming more polluted and poisonous.

Further down the line we might discover another source of power that provides even greater increases in standards of living, but using it recklessly would destroy not just a planet, but, say half the universe.

All those animals produce methane from farting and methane traps heat 2x more effectively than carbon does. Animal agriculture creates 51% of all greenhouse gases.

They can only produce it using carbon they eat, which has to come from plants, and plants get their carbon by removing it from the air. All the emissions produced by animals must, by basic biological fact, be offset by plants having removed that carbon from the air. It's a neutral net balance. More animals doesn't mean fewer plants, since the feed that animals require has to be grown before you can have those animals in the first place. The carbon animals contribute to the air is offset by the fact that plants had to remove it from the air first. I don't know what's so hard about this. Fossil fuels are the real climate change problem, because they have no such offset mechanism. They're just a bunch of loose carbon being dumped with no control or compensation.

No, not in total, but that's not what I'm saying. What I'm saying is that the animals themselves only produce as much carbon bearing gas (CO2 and methane) as the amount of carbon they take in from plants, and those plants take it out of the atmosphere. The other carbon producing activities, like transportation and water processing, are net polluters because they derive most of the energy they take to run from fossil fuels. Burning fossil fuels is what really puts more carbon into the air without taking any of it back out, hence it is the real problem. "If plants do in fact make carbon from CO2" If? How is that an 'if'? This is scientific fact that you should have learned in elementary or middle school. Plants get their carbon from the air, and animals get their carbon from plants. Animal carbon emissions cannot be greater than plant carbon absorption, therefore, animals themselves are not a net source of rising greenhouse gas levels and insisting on going vegan does nothing to help climate change. Actually, oddly enough I agree with you that we should eat a lot more plants and a lot less meat, for a few different reasons, but erroneously throwing "because climate change" at the issue isn't really helping.

And just because it's the leading sector for the production of methane doesn't mean the lesser ones shouldn't be looked at and gotten rid of. There are ethical and health reasons to go vegan not to mention other environmental factors like all the water and food that is wasted on raising livestock.

Due to human activities, how we're growing crops, and raising animals, plants cannot keep up with absorbing as much as we're putting out. If plants do in fact make carbon from CO2 then animal livestock is also producing that as well as the methane so there is even more in the air for plants to photosynthesize with. Along with feeding cows corn that they can't easily digest it makes matters worse because they produce even more methane from that.

UgjBBOOsYCBW0XgCoAEC.8Mpi2PAMfPB8MtFJ23fSQN		1	2016-12-24 23:10:32	Winston Deleon	Incorrect. Here's why greenhouse gasses from farm animals is a wash in the big picture of climate change: animals produce methane and CO2 from the carbon they eat, which ultimately comes from plants, and plants get it by using photosynthesis to take CO2 out of the air. Animals can only put as much greenhouse gas into the air as plants take out, because they're not just getting that carbon 'for free.' Fossil fuels are the real problem in the overall rise of greenhouse gas levels, because they represent a source of carbon that's not coming out of the air, but rather coming from the ground and being put into the air with no compensating removal process. Oil and coal producers and burners are the problem because they're the ones not photosynthesizing anything to re-uptake the pollution they're creating and render it a neutral cycle instead of an out of control buildup.

What do wild animals doing what their instincts are telling them to do have to do with us? That's the circle of life and predators are needed to keep ecosystems healthy. Humans breed animals just to kill them because we like the taste not that we need to for survival. What kind of life is that for these animals? Think about all the water that the animals we raise to kill and get milk and eggs from drink and consume. All the land that is needed to feed these animals instead of going straight to humans. All the water needed to not only give the animals to drink from a baby to full grown but to grow the crops necessary to raise them in that time. It is estimated that just to produce one hamburger it takes 4,000 to 18000 gallons of water just to produce. Not only that but if the world went vegan we could feed at least 9 billion people. The leading cause of death in the world is heart disease and that only happens from eating a diet rich with animal products. Meat, Dairy, eggs, these are just a few things while there is so much more food out there than just kelp or grains. It's kind of like an addiction we have and it's ruining our health.

Another figure puts this number, including byproducts of animal agriculture, at 51% of global greenhouse gas emissions. <br /><br />Methane, which has a global warming potential of 86 times (over 20 years) that of CO2, is produced in almost equal amounts by livestock and natural gas in the US. Livestock also accounts for 65% of anthropogenic N2O emissions, which has a global warming potential of 298 over 100 years and has a lifetime of 121 years.<br /><br />Even if we stopped fossil fuel use globally tomorrow, we would still exceed a CDE limit of 500 gigatonnes by 2030 from animal agriculture alone.<br /><br />I hope your burger was worth the apocalypse.

We don&#39;t really know to much before that. We assume a lot about the past. We don&#39;t really know how hot was during the Roman Empire or how cold was during the Indus Valley Civilisation.<br /><br />Should we get a better deal then fossil fuels?! Of course! Is killing more people than the planet. This &quot;fear mongering&quot; tactics to stop fossil fuel consumption will not work. (Religions tried this strategy, and boy!, they&#39;ve lost on the long run.)<br /><br />If the environmental movement want to succeed, it will be better to try to find a bridge of discussion with Big oil and Big coal, help them still get a good deal on their business and get them invest in clean energy.<br /><br />Just be truthful, if someone would fight to destroy your business, wouldn&#39;t you fight back with all your powers and influence to protect your job and your means of money making? Never corner someone, cause desperation will motivate them to fight until the end. (Lessons from Vietnam War.)	UC-7c_nQBqia7K9sPaKUj-3A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-7c_nQBqia7K9sPaKUj-3A	0

It&#39;s too late for that, sure it will slow things down, but the real solution is planting trees and plants, using proper agricultural methods and maintaining the forests we still have. <br /><br />There is already too much CO2 and other greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere, only trees and plants are able to put that CO2 back into the humus and soil. They are our only real chance at hopefully preventing the apocalypse we are creating and have already created. <br /><br />Keep going with your efforts to reduce fossil fuel usage, but put more thought and effort into finding ways to cover the planet with foliage even if its just planting a garden, or some trees.

If we&#39;re going to tell people to change, tell them to change for their safety and that of future generations. Not because the planet is in danger. It&#39;s not, WE ARE.

Simply look at our number 1 manufacturing centre of the world - China. How bad is the air there for its people?!<br /><br />Option 2) Attempt to reverse the problem that we know isn&#39;t a solution because we&#39;re too greedy of a species to look past our own selfish needs and wants. Corporations will never allow it and governments earn too much from taxes made from fossil fuels. <br /><br />Option 3) Corporations, enough with hiding alternative energy sources, we know they exist and buy them out to hide the technology. Power companies, stop charging higher rates for green energy sources. How do we as consumers know where our energy comes from? It all comes from the same grid. And governments of all tiers (federal, state, local), get serious about energy consumption, power savings, and put solar panels on all government building, schools, and hospitals. Stop the greedy taxations. But you never see this, because they&#39;re not serious about climate change and green energy. Politicians only use climate change to get themselves into power. <br /><br />Seriously people... Corporations rule the earth. Governments are puppets. People are too greedy to care past themselves. If we actually cared as a collective people of one earth, we&#39;d really do something about it. But we won&#39;t.....

In fact there are many easily used alternatives to fossil fuels that will allow us to maintain our current standards of living and avert global warming. Solar energy is already cheaper than fossil fuels and the only reason fossil fuels continue to be invested in is because powerful oil and gas and coal companies manipulate government officials into subsidizing fossil fuels. In fact, India has recently made the decision that it will be able to realistically meet its energy needs 60 percent using renewable energy within ten years. Going green is actually a lot simpler and easier than you think and it doesn&#39;t have to result in any lower standards of living.

You see, the ironic part of this entire video is that at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN5wNFlwiag&amp;t=1m15s">1:15</a> the &quot;expert&quot; Dale Jamieson says &quot;the collapse of our agricultural productivity&quot; which, if Adam did his own research rather than parrot what others research for him, he would realize animal agriculture (ie cows) are the real problem. They account for 51% of the carbon dioxide that is getting into the atmosphere thanks to their farts which contain methane that is causing more damage than all forms of transportation combined. &quot;Cowspiracy&quot; is an excellent documentary (on Netflix and Youtube nonetheless) which I would highly recommend that shows oil is not destroying 60%-91% of the rain forest that is another reason for global warming. So, in other words, if you really care about the earth and want to save it, either stop eating meat altogether, or cut back enough to force the meat and dairy&#39;s hand that feeds you to make a change.<br /><br />tl;dr: Adam, again, isn&#39;t looking at the real picture and animal agriculture is the real problem causing global warming. Also, check out Cowspiracy on Youtube or Netflix.	UCNpK2MrkATgvgezjV1t5rFA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNpK2MrkATgvgezjV1t5rFA	0

So I'll be covering the main points. #1 sea level rise. First we're going to be looking at the Arctic and from geography class you know it is floating sea ice. Now using the most basic of high school physics we can know that ice displaces water. This means that even if the Arctic melted 100% it wouldn't raise sea levels at all. Now over to the Antarctic which is a completely different story as it is land mass covered in ice and would raise sea levels if it were to melt. However even NASA who has been more than just questionable about there integrity on AGW, they have been sued for refusing to release raw data and for producing false papers. And even they admit that the Antarctic is growing by 82 billions tons per year. #2 Now let's look at CO2 itself. And by the way this is where the 97% consensus comes from, 97% of scientists agree that CO2 warms the earths temperature but the debate is climate sensitivity and I will now explain. Now a lot of the numbers you hear are from the IPCC, and this is a problem because this is not a peer reviewed paper. But if you just look at the IPCC they say you'll get 6 degrees F warming per doubling of CO2. However when you look at the peer reviewed studies almost every paper you look at will say you will get between 1-1.5 degrees F warming per doubling of CO2. This is a massive difference and if you go by the peer reviewed science then at the rate we're going now we have nothing to worry about. #3 But the earth is still warming and has been since the last ice age at a constant rate. And graphs like the hockey stick take a jump in the temperature and make it seem abnormal. If you respond to this without throwing childish insults chances are I'll respond but if you're just going to be a troll I'm out.

Our atmosphere traps heat within the earth, because without it heat would escape into space and we would be stuck on a giant clump of ice. Like Mars. With me so far? The stuff that traps the heat in the atmosphere and deflects it back down to earth are called Green House Gases. Y'know the stuff we pump out the back of cars and from power stations. If we put more of this stuff up into the atmosphere, then more heat is trapped and viola: The planet heats up more. What part of this is so hard to understand? When the planet heats up, what is one material which is going to melt in vast quantities when this happens?... Ice! What happens when the sea level rises because of all this extra water? You end up knee deep in water.	UCBH6zRaLNYL0n35fxdeV_lA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBH6zRaLNYL0n35fxdeV_lA	1	Ugirl5JthoGw0XgCoAEC	Extra Work

Both Crimea and Eastern Ukraine used to be part of Russia (with a large minority there still being Russian) until the end of the cold war. Though the real reason is so they can keep control of the black sea if Ukraine joins the EU and the NATO they will lose a major strategic point, if Russia doesn't annex Crimea the NATO would, like they have done in many other places around the world. The NATO had been provocating Russia ever since its existence and now when Russia retaliates everyone gasps. Guess they don't teach these in propaganda class huh.

Besides, China and Russia have in diplomacy what is called a special relationship. If we go to war with China, you can pretty much count Russia in on their side anyway. Lastly, if Trump keeps letting Putin get comfortable, and he decides to invade European countries, the US will have to declare war on Russia anyway.

Now that we have that out of the way, now we need to look at regional location, regional governmentand and any other factors to see if there might be a reason for proving or denying climate change. Science isn't something that can be waved away just because you don't believe in it. Yes you're entitled to your opinion but when there are provable facts that claim otherwise you need to consider the option that you might have an uninformed opinion, and therefore possibly a wrong one.

But her children and grandchildren. Would you like to be remembered as the cause of dispair for your children? There's alot you can do to stop global warming YOURSELF. Of course this requires you change your lifestyle, which many aren't ready to do. Therefore the earth is going to hell. And we need everyone to do this. One thing is to stop buying doritos. A little thing. But doritos are made of palm oil, which is being grown in rainforests, which farmers *BURN* to get more palm oil. This releases all the CO2 the trees had "stored" and also removes some trees that could've made it to O2 Also cows. Cows produce so MUCH methane that they are seriously the worst thing you can buy. Buy pig meat or chicken. NOT cow meat. and methane is about 27 times worse than CO2 as a greenhouse gas	UCkkHGqfey5M3EaIPwFU_4cQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkkHGqfey5M3EaIPwFU_4cQ	1	UgiGzO3zJzhRJHgCoAEC	Robin Ghoshal

There are several well known forcing mechanisms that influence climate and none of these account for the warming being observed since the later 1/2 of the 20th century. 2. Those large portions are beginning to melt - which is a cause for concern due to various feedback mechanisms that will raise temps even further. 3. Yes, hotter and colder. And the drivers of those conditions are well understood. 4. Yes, more CO2 and at times more O2. None of which is relevant to current variation in the climate as a we've come to expect it during the period of the development of human civilisation. 5. You'll start to care about rising sea levels when your taxes go through the roof to pay for relocation of infrastuture such as sea ports, airports, roads and rail that allow our civilisation to trade. Let alone the mass movement of displaced humanity. 6. Extra energy in the weather system will lead to greater disruption and more extreme weather events. 7. The increase in temps and in CO2 is alreasdyt having an effect on vegetation. Most plant forms find it easier to grow with more CO2 however that is not all good. Many plant species that are staple foods for some nations and continents are using that ease of growth to increasing their defense by increasing their toxicity. If you plan to gen eng your way out of that then better get busy - there are 7B to feed. 8. Volcanoes do output CO2. Surveys have been conducted and they show total output from volcanoes world wide are a tiny fraction of the amount of extra CO2 humans are putting into the atmosphere. Yellowstone is not overdue. It doesn't operate to a published schedule. It may erupt tomorrow or not for another 40,000 years. Joining the dots I think what you are saying is that, because YS may erupt soon there's no point doing anything to curb our emissions. Well, in the long run you are going to die so why bother eating any more?	UCJRC0xPOOv4a6yzTMogSeTg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJRC0xPOOv4a6yzTMogSeTg	1	UgiGzO3zJzhRJHgCoAEC	Robin Ghoshal

They brought out the fact that people wouldn't deny climate change if they lived somewhere the effects were so dramatic and obvious.

First of all, yes the world was much hotter in the past however, that was due to tilts in the earth's axis and certain patterns with sunspots. Now, we are seeing that the Earth's axis is fairly normal and that as CO2 emissions rise, we are seeing a change in temp. Another thing I would like to point out is that you think that the earth will only warm due to an increase in CO2 however, this is false. Not only will temp in some areas get warmer and in others cooler, but weather patterns will also change with more droughts and blizzards. Another rebuttal I have is that the ice caps are already melting. It isn't like they will disappear in 2 years, it takes time but it is running out fast. The last thing I would like to counter is your flooding argument. Yes, areas have hurricanes and such, however after hurricanes people can usually go back to their homes or what is left of it. With flooding, that area is gone and is likely to never come back because of so much ice melting. I hope it doesn't seem like I am being a jerk to you, I am just trying to state the facts. I wish more people would state these facts more clearly so there is less confusion. I hope we can have a civil discussion about this.

Probably because of the "history always repeats itself theology that is embedded within us". the truth is pretty much everything that we have not seen repeated through history is seen like a hoax for us. This global phenomena of global warming, whether you believe it or not, is relatively recent. Depending on when you consider accurate weather data was taken, global warming data is only 100-150 years old. Science teachers like new stuff. every year scientific advancements are being made so it is impossible for them to stay buried in the past like us. Not saying one way of thinking is better then the other. One topic you should consider looking over is thermonuclear fission.

Not all do, but there are some schools in heavily Christian communities that want to reject evolution outright. Others treat creationism as just as likely as evolution. I once went to a Christian college for a summer program there, and they had a "Hall of Creationism" filled with what they felt was proof against evolution. Funny thing was most of the evidence they used to try and support their claims were actually things proving evolution that they'd twisted to fit their message.

It is *VERY clear* that the earth is warming *faster* than it has ever does since 1850. We can evaluate the temperature of the Earth using ice for instance and both north and south pole say the *same* thing: mankind is the cause of this massive global warming. Look at this graph, what you should see is NOT how high it goes but how fast it grows.

They are, but like Evolution it's not going to happen in seconds to appease the average attention span like a Pokemon. 2.We also have large portions of the Earth that people cannot live on because they are too hot and have no water. This isn't an argument. 3.Well, yes, when it was a burning mass of molten rock and iron in space it was a LOT hotter. What's your point? 4.Larger insects in the past didn't breathe CO2 any more than modern ones do and died out because of predation by newly evolved birds. The cat example was also about the largest bug we've ever seen on land due to size restrictions on invertebrates in Cope's rule. Basically that they have to be small enough for oxygen to disperse throughout their body. This is why insects with long bodies grew larger than others like dragonflies, scorpions and centipedes. The largest bug ever found was an eight foot centipede species for this reason. 5.Ummm... What? 6.That's making the argument that for climate change to be true the Tropics should get the same amout of rainfall as the artic even though the REASON the Tropics are warmer and has more rain than other parts of the world has nothing to do with things that cause or result from the general argument of climate change(I say it that way because climate change also describes anytime a sunny day becomes rainy and anything in between which isn't the topic at hand.). 7.We already do, but people freak out about GMO food and there is also the risk of it becoming an invasive species. 8.Is there a point to this statement and questions?

I come from a very Christian country, where you can find a chapel for every day of the year in an area the size of Paris and most people accept Climate Change and evolution for that matter. In religious studies (a mandatory subject in Secondary School) we study that the Bible wasn't written to teach us science, so we should learn the morals and spiritual values form the Bible and learn physical truths from the sciences. I went to a church school by the way.	UCezNFIjD8Jx1Pcj5ZfQGnxQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCezNFIjD8Jx1Pcj5ZfQGnxQ	1	UgiGzO3zJzhRJHgCoAEC	Robin Ghoshal

Since the industrial revolution, CO2 levels have skyrocketed, so have the temperatures. Science has shown the greenhouse effect and how it works. The massive increase in CO2 caused by burning fossil fuels is speeding up the natural Global Warming rate immensely. People say it's a hoax because of money. Think about it, governments that depend on oil to generate a lot of income will not simply say "Fossil fuels are bad for the environment, don't buy our oil!". Climate change is real and whoever says it's not is thinking about their own economical gains.

When people say they don&#39;t believe in climate change, they are referring to doomsday narratives like this one, which simply don&#39;t have a serious scientific backing. Al Gore had several acclaimed scientists give him information for &quot;an inconvenient truth&quot;, in which he predicted the melting of the polar ice caps by 2011. And yet, the ice caps are bigger than they were thirty years ago, and there are more polar bears than ever recorded in history.<br /><br /> So stop calling people retarded for questioning every grad student trying to make headlines by saying its the end of the world, and realize that climate change is a heavily debated topic in the scientific community, and realize that of the thousands of doomsday prediction made by scientists, none have come true. So just, chill out. For real.<br /><br /> Also, if you say something like &quot;this percentage of scientist agree&quot;, you&#39;re an idiot.

Liberals have appropriated the environmentalist discourse but never took it seriously. The reality is simply that the current technological civilisation IS NOT SUSTAINABLE. No amount of behavioural change will make any meaningful difference. We are locked in technological structures and infrastructures which are extremely unlikely to change in the next decades, and by that time we will be already in the middle of ecological mayhem. It is simply too late to act on climate change. You will (almost) be better off as a denialist rather than as someone who knows climate change is real but it is not serious.

We can feel it under our feet, made of a mass, a body... All I'm saying is that I don't think that we should keep on drilling really deep holes. Just like any live body or Mass. You shouldn't just keep poking at it because one day in the future when were more advanced there might be a cream that will help it scar. I don't think it's helping humans evolve at all. there is no evidence since we've been so technological as a species, that we are evolving as a species, or that new types of humans are being created. what we know is that we are here now and the people around us are here now. and that's what's real. I'm pretty sure if the top guys weren't so money-hungry that we would figure out a better way to deal with all our needs. That's why so many of us are angry and the only way to get our word out is on social media like this. In the end we know that we're not really solving anything with these comments.

But if you think about it a little, what do people really expect by drilling so deep? what if you reach an area that's just too deep and can cause huge explosions or something bad like that?. why take that risk? This is not like just regretting a purchase and taking it back or saying you're sorry to somebody when you mess something up. if you go too far with the Earth it hurts everybody. or do you think for example you can just dig for miles and miles and miles and never have any type of consequence?or do you think you can just suck up all of the oil and not cause any harm? if someone were to suck out all the blood from our bodies do you think that would make a difference for us? so regardless of all these videos online you just have to ask yourself if we should keep harming the Earth at all. If anything I take this as an eye opener in a sign of caution.	UCuQzDYcswezuvH9Z0b-VUUA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuQzDYcswezuvH9Z0b-VUUA	1	UgiKfwmDrvCG6ngCoAEC	Connor Jensen

Fish represent such a tiny portion of livestock, it hardly impacts our source of food, especially since fishing has decreased and research into genetically enhanced fruits and vegetables increased dramatically over the past decade. We get most of our fresh water from rain reserves and water purification. Even third world countries don't drink from springs anymore. The only impact of environmental poisoning would be having to put another filter on the purification plants.........which wouldn't you know, is funded by money. Look, if we had known the repercussions of using these fuels, I'm sure we would have taken steps to avoiding them when we had the chance, but sitting here crying about the end of the world isn't going to solve anything. Go about your life, adapt appropriately to the rapid changes, and keep looking towards the future. We're humans, we're stubborn, and we're going to be alright. Trust me.

They have press releases all the time. They dont discover these things by talking in meetings. They do it through observations and experimentation. They are the best and brightest in the world and more than 99% of them have deemed there is irrefutable evidence that it is happening. There is no evidence that contradicts it other than speculation. C02 is plant food but there isnt enough plants to filter it out so it builds in the atmosphere. Weve leveled nearly 50% of the worlds trees in the past 2000 years. Trees are the largest consumers of C02. We are gradually using more fossil fuels while we cut down the necessary plants to filter it out. the period youre refering to is thousands of years ago when the planets biosphere was very different than it is now. Things change and evovle. What was true then wont work in the same way today. There is always benefits for someone but the consequences of not doing anything are what the problems is, not who is benefiting. In the end everyone is benefiting.

UgiKfwmDrvCG6ngCoAEC.8MonJxJxOXV8MqbcVRCJix		2	2016-12-23 22:36:35	Veres Ákos	Outlaw Justice Hi there! Just to clarify things. First of all these leaders don't actually meet in remote places as Longblyden but when they do it is to prove a point and show everyone on the conference what we are dealing with (most of them don't really undertsand the problem cause they are political leaders and not environment researchers). 2. I live in Europe and I am a university student I've been three times on such of a congress in 1 year. It is not hard to find a congress about climate change here in Europe but mostly the media just doesn't care about conferences like this. 3. WELL yes it is "plant food"but if it is too much plants can't handle it. Think about it like eating at the Christmas dinner. When you eat more what your body can handle you most likely throw up. The earth is like one huge body and we are a part of it. You really don't want to see when the earth "throwing up"4. Bigger isn't always better.

Even places we call socialist still have capitalist governments and economic systems, they're just run with socialist ideology in mind. The fact that capitalism has so much influence world wide, especially in large countries like the US and China, means that despite the environmental impacts nobody is going to push for the transition to renewable energy because of the fact that it would wipe out an entire industry. It's completely possible to mass produce electric cars and invest in wind and solar energy, but that would be bad for the people who are making money off of fossil fuels. Which is really a decision being made with very little foresight considering the fact that keeping people in work and CEOs making money will mean very little if our planet can no longer provide basic necessities for sustaining life.

Also, I certainly believe they've been "selling" it for a while. It's a slow process, and it certainly started before 1940. Think of it this way: If you put the flame under a frying pan, it takes time for the contents of the pan to warm up and it takes time for them to cool down when you turn off the flame. Besides, if we made an incorrect estimate, we'd be crazy not to correct it now and again. 3. Then why is there an increase in flooding? http://therealdeal.com/miami/2016/04/07/miami-beach-property-values-may-fall-as-sea-levels-rise-experts/ And why are pacific islands literally disappearing? http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36255749 4. Proof? I'd expect major news outlets to cover this kind of stuff. Riling up the public with sensational stories would be very beneficial for them. Yet... silence. 5. 14.73 degrees C right now, https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/global/201610#temp while the Carboniferous period averages ~20 C, which is at least a 5 degree difference in Celcius and 9 in Fahrenheit. http://www.geocraft.com/WVFossils/Carboniferous_climate.html You must be talking about the LATE Carboniferous period which averaged the same as our modern period of the last 2 MILLION years. Our tiny spike is going up within a hundred or so years which is not enough to affect that low average. When temperatures go up or down over MILLIONS of years life can adapt. When the timescale is a century or so, life won't be able to cope. 6. True, this is a thing that's arguably happening, but it's at a truly ludicrous scale. 96% of all studies are in favour of climate change. It's not groundbreaking any more, and I think the reward in publicity and fame would be much higher if you could disprove climate change. As mentioned before, news outlets would eat it up! 7. This makes no sense... why would they want to pay to pollute instead of being able to do it freely? 8. Climate change doesn't cause volcanic activity. Volcanic activity helps cause climate change. Also, preventing more forest fires requires more forest fires to occur in the first place, which happens because... global warming is a thing. An in case you're talking about percentages, it's completely unrelated. How effective we can be with fire fighting depends on economical, political and scientific factors, not environmental ones. 9. That's a stretch. We live in a capitalist society in the West. The amount of people who would have to conspire for this to happen is untenable, and it'd be impossible to keep it entirely hidden from the public, especially when you consider that scientists from all over the world, not just the west, confirm the existence of rapid global warming. 10. Sea ice is not a problem. Land ice is. Glaciers are melting faster than they're growing, and more and more water that was trapped on land, frozen, enters into the oceans.

Methane when burned turns into CO2 yes, although in the atmosphere it reacts with hydroxyl radicals to create vapour and the CH3 radical. This is the largest sink in methane in the atmosphere. Methane is mostly created due to agriculture and is far worse than CO2. "It's just science".

Ehrlich told us that by 1980 at last 100 million people per year would be starving to death, that we'd see "famines of unbelievable proportions" by the 80's, that some 4 billion people would die by 1989, and worse. Yet we're still here. Dennis Hayes told us it's too late to avod mass starvation, right before 46 years of non-mass-starvation. They told us things would happen unless we gave the government control of our nation.... we didn't, and those things just didn't happen.

LOL Here's just a few predictions of doom that turned out to be spectacularly wrong: http://www.aei.org/publication/18-spectacularly-wrong-apocalyptic-predictions-made-around-the-time-of-the-first-earth-day-in-1970-expect-more-this-year-3/ That's a small sample--note that at least four of them told us it was already too late... in or before 1970. "i see somebody didnt watch the video." I see somebody still has nothing but false acccusations. "so far both your claims are nothing but pure speculation based on absolutely no science." LOL--says the guy who thinks "you're stupid" is an argument. My claims are based on simple economic common sense. Companies will sell a product that people will buy, and people will buy the product that does what they want it to do for less money. " but they are oil companies they are going to file chapter 11 and restart business in a field where they have no knowledge? because you said so?" Do you really believe a company needs to file chapter 11 to sell a new product? "but you are too stupid to realize that U.S is not a capitalist society... its a corporateist society which is a very big difference." I don't believe that refusing to buy into whackass conspiracy theories makes me stupid. "if the canidates running for president dont believe in climate change what does that say about the republican voters who chose them?" That they don't buy into silly socialist hoaxes. That's pretty much why they're not voting Democrat in the first place. "if you felt i personally insulted your intelligence then dont be cause you have none." And if you actually had any facts, you wouldn't need to spew ad hominems instead. I actually *feel* complimented that the people who have no argument has bad things to say about me--but feelings are irrelevant here.

"I suspect you're aware of that, seeing as you needed to make childish personal attacks in lieu of facts." -tell me when you start presenting facts cause your entire post was pure speculation as i have showed you^ if you feel bad that i called you stupid then maybe you should be less stupid and stop presenting lies and speculation in lieu of facts. if you felt i personally insulted your intelligence then dont be cause you have none.

If you are talking about peak fossil fuels then that has already happened. Of course fossil fuel company's won't die in 2023, I mean that solar will be cheaper than coal. It will take years from it to dominate the market, and company's will be forced to adapt or die. But one thing cannot be denied, and that is the corruption of fossil fuel oligarchs, and the whole conservative denial of any climate change, even when I believe the majority of them actually know it is real, and are just recieving too much money from corporations(*cough *cough Rex Tillerson/Donald Trump) to agree with the obvious facts and overwhelming proven truth. But solar not being the way forward? Yeah, good luck with alternatives. Unless you think clean coal or natural gas is the solution.

Should there be more stringent environmental regulations, which would hamper the economy? or should money, time, and effort be placed on aiding developing nations, so that a middle class can develop, which is surely the only way to compel citizens to care for the environment. How can those who starve and suffer from diseases be expected to care for the environment? Is climate change the most crucial problem facing the world today? or is it malnutrition, political instability, and disease? What should our priorities be?

Also, there is no "argument". Pretty much every credible source agrees- climate change is real and is being caused by humans. The "debate" may have been real at one point when the science was first emerging (kind of like evolution), but it's basically resolved at this point. The only reason why it SOUNDS like there's a debate is because the media makes more money by pitching it as one, since more people are happier to watch two "experts" debating than they are to have ONE actual expert relaying facts to their face. Framing it as an ongoing debate also helps to drive attention away from the fact that there's still very little we actually know about how we're going to resolve any of this (carbon taxes are a start, but they're FAR from perfect). Not to mention the fact that there pretty much AREN'T any solutions that don't screw over someone, in some way, shape or form. (E.g. getting rid of the coal industry would drop emissions, but you'd end up putting like, half of rural American workers out of business.)

You should KNOW, not believe. You BELIEVE in Santa; you KNOW scientific facts. Name me some facts about how rising temperatures (considering we are coming OUT of an ice age) are directly related to burning fossil fuels. We can have a discussion about that. We can&#39;t have a discussion about how we should live in fear of fossil fuels.<br /><br />2. Let&#39;s talk solutions. Is the solution for the government to fund green energy research? Great! I&#39;m all for it... expect that it doesn&#39;t happen. The government spends money funding &quot;green&quot; companies that don&#39;t actually do anything. Instead, we need to put that money in the hands of research centers that can actually develop cleaner energy.<br /><br />Just like the left doesn&#39;t like the god-fearing Christians who believe you&#39;re going to hell if you don&#39;t go to Church, I don&#39;t like this fear mongering philosophy.

However, just like you learn in your statistics classes, correlation does not mean causation. Over the last 400,000 years, there have been major periods of glaciation, interrupted by brief inter-glacial periods. We are in one of those times now (hence, we're going to see rising temperatures). This is all part of the Pleistocone Ice Age, which began 2.5 million years ago (why there's so much ice at the poles; 30,000 years ago, there was no ice at the poles). - Patrick Moore, co-founder of Greenpeace There is evidence that higher CO2 levels can lead to some warming, but there is no precedent to draw the conclusions that are often drawn. The UN's IPCC (which leans left on this issue) even said just this in their 2007 report: "The long-term prediction of future climate states is not possible." So this makes me skeptical. We do not have sufficient evidence to conclude that CO2 levels cause rising temperatures, so I will not buy into this philosophy that we need to stop using fossil fuels when they provide so much energy to society. Fossil fuels provide cheap, reliable energy that makes modern life possible, at a scale that nothing else can match. There is no evidence that fossil fuels make the environment "dirty." Fossil fuels don't make the world a worse place. They provide energy essential to modern life that makes the world a better place. - Alex Epstein, author of "The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels The EU spends so much money on climate policies hoping they will help prevents droughts & wildfires. Evidence that the number of droughts and wildfires will skyrocket if we don't spend our resources on combating climate change does not exist. However, there is plenty of evidence that many people will suffer dire consequences if proper hurricane defenses are not put into place, but no resources go towards that. In fact, these policies take away resources that could be used to help those people... all in the name of a false narrative with no basis in reality.

Even though they not only stated facts in the video, but also gave sources. So, I think we all agree that global temperatures are rising, and at a rate that is far faster than normal. Because, well, they are. http://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/ And we're definitely the ones causing it. C02 levels are also rising, and pretty much all models say this is a pretty major cause of the rising temperatures And these rising temperatures only going to keep rising. Best case scenario is just a 1.8 C increase by century's end Worst case scenario is a 4.0 C increase https://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/spmsspm-projections-of.html To put that in perspective, it was about 4-7 C colder than it is now during the last ice age. http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/GlobalWarming/page3.php So this warming is a pretty big problem. TL;DR the climate is warming faster than usual, it's our fault, and it's a big deal. As of solutions, we could do our very best to transition from fossil fuels to cleaner sources of energy. We can use our smart brains to come up with better, cleaner, and cheaper ways of getting our energy.

Plus the reaction for thorium is low pressure so it won't blow up if the system fails... the only issue is that it can be costly to start the reaction but after the initial start up it is cheap to run. The only reason that it didn't win out over our traditional reactors is because you cannot use the same materials to make atomic bombs... also opening the canister is only deadly within close proximity and long exposure... it doesn't cause a nuclear blast.....

The problem is when there is an issue it makes huge headlines and people go apeshit compared to the countless small issues created by the other forms of power. Yet those small issues add up to lots of deaths. People just don't notice it. BTW...coal creates more radiation than nuclear.

Generation 3 and 4 nuclear power plants are almost 100% safe provided they aren't getting smacked around by tidal waves and earth quakes every couple of years. In fact newer designed thorium molten salt reactors are looking to be future and china has started to invest heavily into building quite a number of them as they have enough thorium already exacted as a byproduct to provide energy to the country for the next 1000 years.

This material is submerged in a pool for 10 years before being placed int cement canisters. These canisters are then dumped into a hole in a mountain somewhere. This is an ongoing project. The nuclear leftover material is deadly, if anyone were to open the canister, there would be disaster. Now, like I said before, this material remains lethal for the next million years, so how do you prevent future generations from opening these canisters? will they even speak english? will they speak and understand completely different languages, and have different meanings? will a skull and crossbone still mean death, punk, and poison?

Maybe it will also explain some of the arguments of those who do not agree with the theories on climate change and that humans are to blame for these shifts. I&#39;d love to see this addressed from both sides. Fairly. Is the climate of the planet shifting? Likely yes, this planet&#39;s climate has shifted in the past before humans, and will likely shift with us here. I&#39;d like to hear proof other than &quot;this scientist said so&quot; with statistics and data, not just a collection of people who are afraid of their funding being taken away.

The rainforests being cut down and burnt, the oceans filled with garbage patches the size of Texas, micro-plastics found in all the world's oceans, oil spills, the greatest extinction rate since the last mass extinction caused almost entirely by our activity.

There is a direct correlation between the increase in industry and the changes in climate. As for past ice ages, there are five major ones that we are currently aware of (there may have been more, we aren't certain yet). I also want to be clear here, we are still _in_ an ice age. We are in an interglacial period, yes, but this is still an ice age... so no, it should not be ice free. We aren't supposed to be nearing the end of this one, either... it is currently still supposed to be in the stages where it continues to intensify. Also, our species has only existing during this ice age (and we have only had actual civilization during the current interglacial period). Our species would likely be in quite a sad situation if we "accidentally" ended our current ice age because we are too stubborn and greedy to prevent it.

So, in order to find the truth, you've willingly sought out evolutionary scientists and beat back all of their arguments and wrote thesis papers, peer reviewed of course, to disprove evolution? Or are you just coming to YouTube comments to self-confirm your beliefs because no one here is capable to prove what you're asking (hint: no one here is an evolutionary scientist, wrong place to look buddy)?

Carbon dating was invented by man to make sense of age of something but never truly knows the actual proof. I really don't care if you don't understand, but you're welcome to argue to yourself about it. Case in point, evolution has no proof of "evolving" from something else. In the sense that ugly apes became human. Right. Prove it. Not even Darwin could prove it.	UCUQ7jztcyJcnutve9HmBt9w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUQ7jztcyJcnutve9HmBt9w	1	Ugi0szSePuPuc3gCoAEC	MJA

Or look at the old marine life in California's sandstone cliffs that are now below sea level. Or read about the forests that were at antarctica.

But not nearly as much oxygen as before the great extinction event( asteriod, comet, virus, whatevar). High oxygen levels, what we now have, speeds the reproduction of mammals and increases the size of mammals, including the billion of humans that inhabit the earth. Human reproduction is also increased by artificial means. The government provides free ivf pregnancies, deliveries, food and shelter to any migrant that walks into America. Will human reproduction decrease because of the carbon dioxide increase? ( If it did, it would help america to financially survive.) And i guess you may have heard of the sixth great extinction(caused by humans)... Paleoclimatology textbooks now teach that the earth was warmer because of carbon dioxide. But really that is being politically correct. Scientists know there were many reasons. Like changes in space radiation, like what is causing the cold winter we are seeing now. Changes in the sun change the strength of the field that protects the earth from deep space radiation. Specifically, high energy protons from cosmic explosions that happened before peope could write. I could easily copy wikipedia to see what are the leading theories in ancient climate change but i am sure you know how to use it. And this is a map of ancient america.

It was an entirely different scenario, one that is irrelevant to now than it is. Saying that the earth was hotter before doesn't mean anything. Honestly, reading scientific data doesn't help if you're drawing the wrong conclusions. What if the past had conditions vastly different than ours now and is thus no applicable? What if the past is indicative of possible future warming but without our CO2 emissions? That would be our worst case scenario. I'm not a climate scientist, but it makes sense to me that massive CO2 emissions are heating the earth too much. If you're really convinced that your findings are concrete, then go take it up with the climatology groups and see what they have to say.

I think you have legitimate concerns, particularly if the individuals who vehemently support misconceptions about Climate Change damage the cause by spreading falsehoods. "Polar Bears are going to die!" is a stupid argument and doesn't help anyone to understand the real impacts of climate change. All it does is get people outraged about the death of polar bears instead of being committed to real change. It's true scaremongering. "Solar Freaking Roadways" and other gimmicky projects which aren't practical and take funding from the steady process of building sustainable solutions are also a problem, particularly when their failures make people illogically lose faith in the overall science. On a side note, what do you think of Tesla/Solarcity's plans? Do they fall under the category of impractical publicity stunts or do you think the economics of solar roofs and electric vehicles are practical? You mentioned owning a solar cell on your roof.

It bothers me that if I were to bring up any criticisms I'd be labeled a denier.  Even though I'm just trying to take a 'middle-of-the-road' approach here, since OP said "surprising amount of agreement" I felt I'd voice some of the most common (and sensible) grievances I personally have and/or hear.  Obviously I wouldn't try and argue "it snowed in shasta last week therefore it's fake!" as that's a very flawed argument that I'm sure everyone in this thread can point out the obvious flaws of. But again though; for anyone/everyone reading this.  My biggest issue with global warming discussions is the mentality that the other sides aren't allowed to have a voice.  Anyone who would rather silence their opposition than do their best to make them look a fool for their opposed position; loses credibility in my eyes.

They list a lot of individual examples of people they think profit from Climate Change or projects that failed and then call it case closed, or they don't bother to do research before attacking the scientific consensus. I've tried in the past and gotten ridiculed in return for being a "sheep".

As for driving "gas guzzlers", you are telling me that climate scientists all drive SUVs? That these individuals all make choices to use more fossil fuels? CO2 isn't simply "plant food". There are three components that plants need to grow: Water, sunlight and CO2. 6 CO2 + 6 H2O --> 1 C6H12O6 + 6 O2. If you don't have additional water and more energy from sunlight to go along with that extra CO2, then the plant can't use it to create sugars. Massive climate differences including greater humidity provided the extra water needed for larger plant life in the Carboniferous. http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/carboniferous/carblife.html I often hear references to people "gaining stuff" or "benefiting" from "scare tactics". What exactly are these people gaining? Who is benefiting? What kind of control is being exerted and how is this control beneficial to the people who hold it? If your intention is to conjure up images of shadowy figures who control us through fear, you seem to be indulging in a bit of scaremongering yourself.

As for turning the roads themselves into solar power generation...it simply isn't feasible. Financially it would cripple any country that tried seriously to implement it. Pavement is actually recycled at a rate of 99-99.9% (this is off of memory, so it may be slightly lower, but it's still close) so the video talking about all the waste present in pavement roads is laughable. My main issue with it though was the general attitude of the video and how so many people that I know jumped onto the bandwagon.

Even though their population is decreasing at a level which will send them to extinction? Where did you read that claim that they would be extinct by 2008? And the Hyperloop is still in testing you can't just expect someone to say they have an idea and then magically have it appear within a day. Finally to how much of those projects did you actually give your own money? Failure is a part of research not everything is going to work. Some of those claims were outlandish and not to be trusted I will agree on that. But just because some of these projects failed doesn't mean we should abandon the idea that climate change is impossible to stop.

But I've already bashed them, how about Hybrid Cars?  Where the people driving them always act so smugly about how 'I'm helping save the environment' while being too stupid to realize that battery they're toting around is toxic waste that will be thrown into a landfill and theoretically do far more damage than just driving a normal (non-gas-guzzler) car. Or what about that (((Dell))) experiment to make plastic out of air to cut down on ocean pollution, they got a lot of funding, what do they have to show for it? Or what about the California Hyperloop; to cut down on car travel (and thus emissions) by setting up a "vacuum train" as I'll call it that goes from northern to southern california? I'm all for -saving the planet- saving life on the planet, cutting down on our footprint, you name it.  I recycle, I use reusable bags, I have a solar cell on my house. But I will *_still_* get skeptical the moment someone starts scaremongering and then asks for money to fund their project.

They changed their position a lot. Climate change vs Global Warming. I have a problem with people that don't actually say:"I am wrong and data was unsufficient". Remember we have rockets to make the sky clear. I am not even kidding. So let's say CO2 is very very toxic. It will take maybe 300 years to go to that "2 degrees". Now my big question is. Do you honestly believe that no one has a plan? That they don't know how to solve it? They know the solution and probably they don't even care? It's just a chess match of :"I don't want to spend money to fix Earth where no one will see anything, lets wait 150 more years when people will be scared and we will raise like Jesus from water". This is not a race this is a chess match. If you can't see the bigger picture and you believe that we have a tehnology so low that we can't fix it. I feel sad for you. If we have an impact on it, and we have time to foresee it... It's not a danger it's just a marketing scheme.

Honestly we don't have much of a right to doubt them. Think about it. They have spent their life learning and researching on this. How long have you and I spent?

I've seen the lack of evidence on one side, I've seen the ridiculing and vilification of the other by the side with not enough evidence. And all I can agree is: the globe is getting warmer, however, I haven't seen evidence that suggests it's because of the small amount of co2 that humans pump into an atmosphere that's already heavy on co2 and other gases. Maybe in time if they stop making fun of people and actually try to show some evidence instead fo bullying even scientists who disagree, maybe the message will get through, until then I won't be a puppet for the people like Al Gore who want to make business out of global warming.

I don't know if you except them to just disappear overnight but that's not how nature works. Every year, their population decreases which indicates the species eventual extinction. 2. You claim this isn't discussed but I just had to google "Antarctica growing" to find discussions about various theories like this one: https://insideclimatenews.org/news/31052016/why-antarctica-sea-ice-level-growing-while-arctic-glaciers-melts-climate-change-global-warming and another discussing the study that led to the findings: http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/11/151103-antarctic-ice-growing-shrinking-glaciers-climate-change/. There probably won't be much said about it until there's a solid consensus around a theory about the why though 3. China has already set ambitious climate change goals and has been steadily decreasing its coal consumption in the past few years. In comparison, the US seems ready to spend at least 4 more years denying reality with a president who thinks coal is clean energy. Instead of pointing fingers and having to be dragged into progress, why can't the US be the leader they pretend to be and rise to the biggest challenge of our time? 4. A lot of people refuse to argue with what sounds like denier arguments because they've found out trough experience that it's a completely pointless enterprise	UCU3_DwkVfbGUjHwqU1OjDfQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU3_DwkVfbGUjHwqU1OjDfQ	1	Ugi0szSePuPuc3gCoAEC	MJA

At this point polar bears going extinct have been incorrectly predicted about as often as the f*cking rapture. Secondly: None of the "climate scientists" want to talk about the hemispheric shift. As the northern hemisphere is getting hotter, the southern hemisphere is getting colder. As the north pole melts, antarctica grows. And with the north-star becoming less and less north, this would all suggest we're tilting more than warming. Third: China and India have some of the highest amount of air-pollution and CO2 emmissions, the kind we're often told to reduce in order to 'save the world'. Yet despite this, why is it exclusively on western civilization to minimize our carbon footprint? Why does no one call out China on putting out three times the emissions we do? Well because that would be 'racist' of course; you can't criticize our Asian neighbors for not holding themselves to the same standard they demand you rise to. Finally: My biggest issue. The "denier" aspect. If you ask any questions, like the two above, neither of which say "you're wrong" both of which are asking "explain? more info?" they'll label you a 'climate denier' and avoid engaging further with you. This to me shows cowardice, that they're afraid they don't have data to back up their claims, and they'd rather call their opposition names until they leave, rather than sitting down and calmly and rationally explaining their point. "Climate denier" "God denier" "Holocaust denier". None of these groups will substantiate their claims, yet will continue to demand everyone agrees with them, without question. I personally do believe the globe is getting hotter, and it will cause serious issues, but, I feel the whole 'IT'S HAPPENING!' is being blown out of proportion so snakeoil salesmen can scam the dumb hippies out of their money. Remember "Solar Freakin' Roadways" anyone? $4,000,000.00+ in funding? What do they have to show for it?

Being good at one does not mean you are good at the rest. I wouldn't ask Stephen Hawking to answer my questions on evolutionary biology, I would ask an evolutionary biologist." "Climatology", by it's very nature, has to based on PHYSICS ya dingbat! Just like physics has to be based on mathematics! The former has to have solid grounding in the latter to work! Physics involves the study of matter and its motion and behavior through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force. One of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, the main goal of physics is to understand how the universe behaves. Even the word "Physics" comes from the Greek words for "knowledge of nature". You simply can't do "climate science" without a solid education in physics! It literally tells you what is physically possible and impossible! I can't even believe I have to even explain this very basic concept! That alone tells me that you are an idiot with no real education who's shooting their mouth off on things they have no real concept of! The very fact that you claim to believe that "They are very different scientific disciplines" is just further proof that you are not even at the level of an amateur! Holy Christ, do you have ANY idea just how STUPID you look just by putting that online?! I'm not even going to argue anymore. You are too much of a close-minded idiot to learn.

Supposedly all the member nations have an equal say, but five have the power to veto anything they see as unfavorable, meaning they can take advantage of all the other nations in the world. Just one veto from one of these five nations can stop a resolution that the rest of the UN could be behind. How's that for international cooperation? Their peacekeepers often engage in child prostitution in poor war-torn countries that the UN refuses to condemn, and they routinely leave hundreds of thousands of people to suffer and die. Just ask Bosnia, Rwanda, Darfur, Kosovo, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Syria, and any non-USA country that routinely has to dead with international terrorism. So, in light of their history of terrible judgement, please forgive me if I'm a tad skeptical of a UN endorsement.

I would love having the beach closer to my home. Even if we lose our captial. Who needed the Washington monument anyways? Seriously, a warmer climate means more hurricanes, floods, and sea levels rising 200 feet, which is where the majority of the world live. Desertification means less crops. Acid in the sea rising means less fish, and massive algae blooms that remove all oxygen from the water. Are you an expert climatologist? None of us here are, so maybe you should listen to the majority of climate scientists, who do research and use a large reserve of data. Mention one or to names, great. Read online the quotes of thousands, if not tens of thousands of qualified climate scientists. The UN is putting 90% confidence in climate changes existence, and they have the best scientists on the planet. C02 starved won't happen, but it is in our hands of what to do.

Are YOU an expert climatologist? And keep in mind that the UN's IPCC has been putting forth fraudulent data for YEARS to influence political decisions. They were exposed on this 6 years ago. Nobel Prize-winning scientists like Dr. Ivar Giaever and Dr. Robert B. Laughlin have started disputing "climate change" as fraudulent. I'd say they're a lot more qualified than you or me to speak on the matter. Still not convinced? Try the words of an ACTUAL expert climatologist, Dr. Hans Jelbring of Stockholm University: “Those who call themselves ‘Green planet advocates’ should be arguing for a CO2- fertilized atmosphere, not a CO2-starved atmosphere…Diversity increases when the planet was warm AND had high CO2 atmospheric content…Al Gore’s personal behavior supports a green planet – his enormous energy use with his 4 homes and his bizjet, does indeed help make the planet greener. Kudos, Al for doing your part to save the planet.” Sorry, but the top people pushing "Global Warming" have a ton of money to gain by doing so. Therefore, any "expert climatologists" connected to them are suspect. Like those "scientists" paid by Gatorade to find exciting new reasons why people should stay hydrated.

Scientists found a coal bed that was supposedly millions of years old. They tested a piece for C14 and found some even though C14 should only last a fraction of that time and should not be present. They then tested each sample that they could get their hands on. Each one had C14. This means one of two things: 1. There are some very bold assumptions being made that have no basis in science. 2. Elves came along and replaced the old coal in the dead of night with new coal. Again, this is just one of countless examples and if I wanted to list them, I would be typing all day. The point is that all of these dating methods are reliable until someone comes along with a historical account of when they were there and then it is just a hiccup in the dating method.

It's a common thing for people to think now that medieval society thought the world was a plane, but as DeathNoteFan said, in fact the ancient Greeks already knew the Earth was round, later estimating the size of the Earth with a 2%-20% margin of error at around 240 BC. It's also a common thing for people to believe that science has always existed, but in fact, although people have always studied the world, the scientific method, and therefore science as we know it today, dates back to those same Greeks who already knew the earth is round. Since the belief that the Earth is round predates science, it isn't correct to suggest that scientists once believed the earth was flat. Of course, your assertion that there's a fallacy in the argument that "almost every scientist believes the Earth is rapidly warming up, therefore so should you." makes sense. But here's the thing: these people have done their research and come to their conclusions. The argument isn't that you should trust them, but that you should trust the research they've done on the matter. Research that's backed up with facts. I recommend that instead of saying "Maybe this is the case", "I've not yet heard an explanation for that", and "But this one thing doesn't make any sense to me" and expecting us to know the answer, you go and look at scientific research yourself. It's what it's there for. Instead of asking us about the plane found buried at Greenland, you should have found some research that backs up your argument and presented it to us, and maybe you might convince us to change our minds. Right now you're just spouting questions at us. For example, in reference to the Grumman that crashed: after looking it up, I found out in a matter of minutes that it crashed in a GLACIER of all places. What do glaciers do? They move. They're practically rivers made out of ice. I don't think it's a stretch to say that things can get buried deep in the ice within mere decades. If you have a paper or other counterexample I'd be glad to hear it. Don't ask us why we're right, point out why we're wrong, please.

You likely reference ice cores, but that is fallacious reasoning. In WWI a Grumman Duck crashed in Greenland and was lost for nearly 70 years. A team went to find it, but found in under 20 feet of ice. According to the assumptions of most scientists this would make the plane thousands of years old. Is it possible that these ice cores were not laid down over millions of years, but over the course of a much shorter time. Therefore, being able to look at the temperature and CO2 concentrations from years ago is logically fallacious.

It is really eye opening and it shows how far this has gone. I personally think that it would be easy for the United States to have 90% clean energy.

But life thrived, and the earth did very well.<br /><br />Carbon dioxide is the bottom of the food chain. Commercial greenhouses pump extra carbon dioxide to help the plants grow better. <br /><br />Carbon dioxide levels in the air have been falling and falling for hundreds of millions of years, and this carbon has been getting stored in fossil fuels. If we don&#39;t put this carbon back into the air, then the carbon dioxide levels in the air will eventually become so low that plants will not be able to live. And without plans, there can be no animals.	UCs6xQdo8TSwvWc2Applcd4A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs6xQdo8TSwvWc2Applcd4A	0

We have to ensure that they don't have to worry about those things, that they can see the mistakes we and the generations before us have made, and try to make something better.

It usually heats up and then cools down and this has been happening forever. "What if we're heating up?" You may ask, well you see, we should've been cooling down 200 years ago. Earth should've been uninhabitable or a while for humans. Now another thing.

Also, the Earths magnetic field has been weakening by itself for many years now, which has been lowering the protection against the sun, I feel like the things we have done recently hasn&#39;t done much but it gets blamed because its the only thing we can pin it on	UC-2qMj-9NWfnMe3SGJBMKcA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-2qMj-9NWfnMe3SGJBMKcA	0

But the Earth wont go away: we will, as well as many other living creatures. A lot of people still doubt global warming. And that is a good thing. I study Earth and Environmental studies in college. Science is basically our tool to explain what goes on now. And we can only explain what we can observe and what gathered data tells us. If people say global warming is not true, then they should have the data and the tests to show this. And if enough stands, then we should have nothing to worry about. Yet, we currently have too much evidence to ignore global warming as a threat. People care about money and such, which is understandable. Yet, will that money still be as valuable 20 years from now? Who knows, if we do not get ourselves into WW3 due to politics, we would be in WW3 due to lack of fresh drinking water.

The right is asserting that climate change is already happening, we can't realistically force other countries to stop using fossil fuels, we can't be out done by other nations that won't stop using them unless we keep using them, and lastly some are skeptical of humanities role in in since the earth is going through lots of warming and cooling periods. I don't know what the answers are, but I do know that it's way more complex than "the republicans hate mother earth and think it's only 6k years old!!! nazis!!!"

I am not trying to prove or disprove climate change or global warming. I am only giving examples of when the scientific method has changed throughout history. I used Clinton as an extension of the idea that common belief can be incorrect. I never compared that to any scientific theory, only the principles. Obviously you are not well versed in mythology as a part of an ancient society. Mythology to the ancient romans, Greeks, Egyptians and many more was a way to view the world. This view has been described as one of the first occurrences of scientific theories. Many of these were basic and disproven, but the scientists did work to prove them to the best of their ability. (For instance, a well respected scientist ( of the past) once described volcano's as being "the tears of the gods". He quite literally meant that, and at the time, the way he defined the natural phenomena was deemed scientifically accurate. Today obviously that is not the held theory, because as we gained access to newer technology, we were able to disprove old theories which were then replaced. Although they viewed it as spiritual, higher power was the only way those theorists could describe those natural phenomenon. Since they couldn't disprove this, it was believed to be true. I never argued the existence or nonexistance of any theory, I only argued that these theories we hold to be true today, could potentially be incorrect. Thus, I believe we should hope for the best, hope this is all wrong and hope that years later we can call this a myth like the roman pantheons, but we also should prepare for the worst, innovate safer and more efficient energy solutions, and be more conscious about the planet on which we live.

(As well as being a god of the forge and metal) This again was a theory many of Rome's respected scholars agreed on, that only a higher power could cause such an event. Today, we have a new theory for it which does not involve any extraterrestrial beings. However at one point, the same theory was explained by Hephaestus, and was widely accepted. It is thus naieve to not account a possibility for yet another change in theories when new evidence provides itself by ever advancing technology.

To prove this, you would need hundreds of thousands of years to study and develop theories, many of which will fall through. We didn't even know how to harness electricity until about 500 years ago.

Just like back when led was said to be safe to used in toys, companies sponsored scientists to say that led isn't harmful. "I compare this to plate tectonics theory, or the theory of the big bang" both being extremely well proven. You might need to learn scientific language a bit better. Scientific theories are "A scientific theory is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world, based on a body of facts that have been repeatedly confirmed through observation and experiment.

A scientific theory is a very different thing from when your uncle Al speculates about moon bases and calls it a 'theory." Scientific theory is based on examination of data, and is the highest order of scientific certainty you can get with most scientific fields (the next highest, and actually highest order is a Law, like the law of thermodynamics.) When someone talks about scientific theory, they're talking about something that is damn near certain.

Yes, they run tests, but they can't prove anything with these tests, they can only theorize. So it is equally possible there is another reason this is happening. The last time I read it, global warming was still a theory, since it is too broad to prove, and there is data for and against it, without explanations to either. I compare this to plate tectonics theory,or the theory of the big bang. Frankly we could look back in 100 years and see all of this as mythology. The romans believed in a higher power, now we see their theories which they called science as complete myth.

To my knowledge most of the good river already has a dam in it.	UCiJPHtf3sK4U0fUaIGAImOQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiJPHtf3sK4U0fUaIGAImOQ	1	UggW8j9A-8JIM3gCoAEC	HerveyShmervy

So around 50-75% of the time it not working and it not including cloudy situation causing the panel to only generate about 20% of the power it can generate. so if a country want to run on pure solar panel it need to have a battery that can store the power for 12 to 18 hours and have a solar farm that will generate between 2 to 4x the power used by the country. which finally my last point is the area of a forest that has to be cut for the solar panel which absorb more CO2 than the amount solar panel reduce in the same area.

What I meant is why nuclear is cheaper is because of this: While solar may be cheap, it's energy output is nothing compared to nuclear power. So, multiplying solar panels to generate the same energy as nuclear results in building and maintaining the solar panels makes it expensive compared to the costs of building and maintaining a nuclear plant for the same energy output.

Here are reasons why: 1. While building nuclear plants is expensive, it can also be cheap to run. So building nuclear plants is a good investment. (Like electric cars. Expensive to buy, but cheap to run.) 2. The chances of having an accident at a nuclear power plant is astronomically low. For 50 years of civil nuclear power generation, there have only been 3 major accidents that occured (mostly because of recklessness and faulty safety design) For example, the reason why the Chernobyl disaster ever took place because the safety systems were turned off during a stress test. 3. Comparing nuclear to fossil fuels, the waste from producing nuclear power is low compared to the tons of CO2 produced from fossil fuels, all for the same energy amount. Radioactive waste is not dangerous if handled properly. 4. Solar energy is inefficient, hydroelectric energy can destroy water life, and wind energy can only be produced from windy areas and can create sound pollution.

The waste from nuclear reactors also don't go away, it must be stored, and for that much energy to be released to cover the impact coal has, it would be astronomical how much land is wasted with nuclear landfills.

If we ever did have to leave earth, mars would be our only option though. So another Goldilocks planet is out of the question. everything is to far away.

The different gravitational field strength will make it impossible to give birth on mars. we haven't evolved to live on any other planet but this one, which is why when we move, if we move, we should go to an Earth like, 'goldilocks' planet. People going to mars is all fun and games until you realise reproduction probably can't happen. That, and not enough genetic diversity can fit its way in the handful of people that will be going to save the species.

If nothing goes wrong, we could have a special few living on the planet by 2100, or maybe a little sooner. Though I was partially joking in the comment, It could happen.

As a 15 year old myself, I fear the world that people like Trump are going to leave for me to live the rest of my life in. Why would I put another child on this planet to suffer for our mistakes?<br />I can understand if you think Trump&#39;s policies can make America &quot;great again&quot; or whatever. But he isn&#39;t where he is for the people, no matter what he says. He wants to make businesses, including himself&#39;s have as much money as they can before they die and leave a world choking on itself behind for future generations to suffer through.

We can start burning fossil fuels on Mars to raise its general temperature and allow for basic photosynthesis. Once the climate stabilizes, we can move all eligible humans to Mars to colonize. In reality, the cost of this would be larger than every economy combined would be able to take and would take centuries.

This year&#39;s winter was the coldest my city has ever been in recorded history and countless other cities have broke temperature records. If anything we&#39;re going into another ice age, not the other way around. What is giving billions of dollars to scam artist scientists going to achieve for &quot;climate change&quot; that we couldn&#39;t already do without needing to give billions?

If anyone in this comment thread knew anything about the environment and how it's effected by firewood they'd know the smoke from firewood promotes rain droplets.

To the way US is acting or the way we are acting. This problem is intricate, if America stopped all emissions, China would just destroy the Earth with its carbon emissions. If China stopped, America would do the same. Co-operation is central to actually fixing the problem. We can't just ask the liberals or the conservatives to just drop what they are doing, we need to set a goal and work together, and calling the other side stupid, weak, or stubborn is not going to help that.

Insignificant is what this data is. There are differing opinions and each side is clinging to what little "understanding" they have. There are people that think they can change the weather slightly to help global warming and other insane ideas. Cutting a person's brain out would remove brain cancer from the body before it spreads. You can't make decisions and choose "fixes" if you don't understand the problem or the answer. I get these you've seen An Inconvenient Truth and believe crap people say on the internet and TV. Sometimes people should think for themselves. And I don't believe I ever said global warming isn't happening or that we aren't causing it. But hey read between those lines that don't exist because having any real proof of anything doesn't matter.

Life wouldn't be able to adapt to a temperature change that happens over 250 years. You also seem to be missing the fact that the deserts would not disappear at all, but rather move across the current developed countries (Europe & US). Jungles are not good places to live anyway. Even the countries that thrive the most in tropical places (Brazil, India) aren't exactly enjoying the highest standard of living - meanwhile pests like the tsetse fly would migrate northwards, thereby affecting huge areas of cattle whilst high carbohydrate crops such as wheat, rice and potato would fail where they currently thrive (Perhaps these could be grown in Canada & Siberia). Just think about how long it takes a tree to grow - how can you expect hundreds of thousands of trees to suddenly spring up over a time period of even 1000 years? Meanwhile, desert temperatures would certainly prompt the extinction of many species in what are currently temperate climates (As well as droughts etc.).

That goes a long way in reducing your carbon footprint. Animal products are extremely energy inefficient, being higher on a energy/biomass pyramid than plants. They are extremely space inefficient, and are the cause for a massive amount of deforestation. We cannot reasonably keep going consuming animal products at the rate we are now.

In fact for most people, going net zero is near impossible, short of going pre-industrial. For instance thinking about how much goes into producing a car, a house, everything in it. It can be done, but it's not cheap.	UCOOp555yItr-aoInAktAcgg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOOp555yItr-aoInAktAcgg	1	UgiFOCdpcljA0XgCoAEC	paul wheaton

During the age of dinosaurs we had 5 times more carbon in the air compared to today. Plants grew bigger, plankton grew bigger The middle east was a forest instead of a desert If global warming occurs All of northern Canada and Siberia will be available for farming, We will see deserts like the Sahara and the middle east turn into forests. More heat and more humidity means more rainfall worldwide. Increasing freshwater supplies around the world. Remember all the carbon in plants and animals come from CO2, the earth is at a historic low in CO2 because over thousands of years animals and plants absorbed carbon and then got buried in earth transforming into natural gas, oil, and coal. The faster we can burn all our fossil fuels the faster we can have temperatures similar to the Jurassic and Triassic ages in which animal and plant life not only thrived but grew to larger sizes	UC63PtL8mD-eGPXF-vOUMoPw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC63PtL8mD-eGPXF-vOUMoPw	1	UgiFOCdpcljA0XgCoAEC	paul wheaton

At the same time, there are places that have been hit by forest fire that would enjoy some seed. And there are landowners that will tell you that they would like more trees. Once you know that this works, and you get the seed, you might be surprised at the number of opportunities that present themselves.

Even if we did go about tossing seeds around, farmers and other land owners would just remove them because they're not wanted. Tresspassing on other people's lands to plant trees to reduce a carbon footprint will net more trouble than most people are willing to pay.

The fossil fuel industry requires consumers. So if consumers are not buying and fossil fuel profits are dropping. Then you are effecting the fossil fuel industry. They are not isolated and immune from consumers and individuals. Sure your little drop of oil to their barrel seems insignificant, but you bought that drop from their barrel. We individuals need to stop blaming fossil fuel as some isolated outside force and realize the industry is us. We are the demand the industry is filling. Lower your demand for fossil fuel and you lower the ability of fossil fuel to influence the outcome of the earth.

If you wish to address reducing our petroleum footprint, my list on how to easily do that is a bit different from a carbon footprint, but I can do that too. The key is, to make a difference, we must zero out our own footprint (done) and then duplicate that with, say, 20% of the population.

I am in a pretty good area with some great local organic farmers who are ahead of the curve compared to many other areas. Folks definitely should do their due diligence about the farms they buy from. Even better than buying from the markets, is actually going direct to farms you know and trust. There are a lot of wonderful direct sales farms, that you can visit and see how they produce the produce, get to know the farm and farmers. You also get about the freshest produce you can get without growing it yourself that way.

Incandescent light emits high quality light AND an efficient form of heat: radiant heat. Radiant heat is much more efficient than convective heat, which is the way most people heat their homes. With smart use of light bulbs, you can heat the people in the house rather than the whole house and make dramatic cuts in your heating bill. 50% to 90% is reasonable.

The problem is that we, and millions of other species, didn't evolve in the environment that we are creating. Also, the Earth is not a repairman, so it wont fix anything. Life would simply adapt and evolve in order to survive under the new conditions.

Better than letting the earth repair while we sit back, we can actively assist. Doing things like: Stopping the massive top soil degradation from plowing and tilling field for example would be a huge step to letting earth repair. Reforesting as much of the planet as we can to aid in carbon sequestration. While at the same time learning not to cut down so much trees and plants. Of course the whole lowering our fossil fuel use. Huge and important, no need to crank up the heater and roll up the windows on space ship earth during summer heat wave now is there. Now these seem like big difficult things. But there are smaller things that are easier to do for individuals. Like don't buy out of season produce. Or bring your own bag to the store. Plant a garden and make as much of your own food as you can. Try and limit the amount of plastic you purchase by looking for things without it. A great resource to learn more about how to make positive changes and make the world better is to visit https://permies.com/ where folks are working on solutions way beyond the feel good CFL light bulb.

Earth went though 100&#39;s of environmental changes that were not caused by us and continental shifts.<br />3.

Ugj8bRKUKBRKrngCoAEC	0	0	2016-12-22 23:07:31	MetalSonicReject	Here&#39;s the thing people are misunderstanding: global warming isn&#39;t a new threat; global warming has been around since the Earth was formed, with the first global warming event happening when said planet was a brand new hunk of molten rock. It generated so much carbon dioxide that it all eventually formed into the first rain clouds, which lead to the birth of water. Theoretically speaking, what we are currently experiencing is nothing more than an accelerated global climate event, meaning that the Earth is going to get hotter faster than usual. <br /><br />That said, we shouldn&#39;t just sit back and wait for Hell on Earth, but instead we, and by we I mean mostly oil and fossil fuel companies, need to invest in more eco-friendly energy sources, such as solar, nuclear, and even electric. These companies have made millions upon millions upon millions of dollars for decades, so I certain that they will be fine for a few more decades if they stop investing in fossil fuels.

It has been both much warmer and much cooler than it is now. Record keeping began at the tail end or just after the "little ice age". The charts that project Earth's climate raise to a lesser degree without human activity, but still raise. Problem is photo-voltaic is not efficient enough to take over (and we just can't take up huge tracts of desert), wind spoils views and has many other side effects (not to mention it is hard to predict what would happen if we disrupt wind flow and take enough energy out of the atmosphere to make a significant impact), nuclear reactors well we just can't their nukes.... There are no easy answers and this planet will get along just fine. Animals will do as they have always done: adapt or die. Now, why do so many Americans not believe? My take is that when presented with a 100% caused by man we must take drastic immediate action that will likely destroy our standard of living argument followed up by a "your are with us or against us" many rebel. Compound that with a "you must do this, but I spread the word and buy carbon credits so I can have a carbon footprint the size of a small city" attitude from the most visible proponents and the conspiracies write themselves. Let "the climate is changing and we have a non-insignificant role in that, and even if we did not the other benefits alone are sufficient reason to take all reasonable steps to shift to cleaner energy" be a valid answer and there would likely be less stringent pushback.

I'm likely more green than most people. I rarely ride in cars, and I don't own a car myself. While not vegetarian, I try to eat mainly plants, and have meat/chicken be somewhat rare - less than 3 times a week in total. I think that it's better for my body this way, and I still don't limit myself. I make sure that plants are my main source of energy. I don't generate massive amounts of trash, unlike some people, and I generally try to recycle. I do some things. Things that don't inconvenience me much. Why just that? I'm not a fossil fuel company. I'm not a company at all. Even if all people were like me (which isn't perfect, I know, but I like to think that it's relatively at least somewhat good), it would not be very effective. Companies must choose to prioritise the environment. Fossil fuel must lose out to renewables NOW. Sorry, but it's not in my hands.

It could totally still calve though, which would be almost as effective, but the effects would be less immediate since the ice would have to float away for a while since the water under the glacier is pretty salty, it would float mostly. However, once it reached an area with a temperature at which it could start to melt, that area would potentially have a similar (but obviously higher) salinity as the iceberg, at which point the ice would displace the sea water as if it was melted. Also, and I just thought about this, the more the ice melts, the more water is in the ocean. But salt is added at a much slower rate. therefore the salinity of the ocean would start to drop and ice floating in the water would start to sink a bit more. Probably wouldn't raise anything more than a centimeter or so, but still pretty interesting.

A couple degrees could cause it to melt enough for large chunks of ice to break off and fall into the water, raising the water to the same level it would be at if those chunks had melted instead. Your math isn't wrong, but I'm not sure about your non math estimate. I would think it would be more than that… maybe less? I think actually it would be around two meters because the higher it goes the more it goes on the land…actually, it's almost impossible to efficiently calculate….

There is not enough sunlight and (as far as i know) no direct air/water currents to bring that heat. Tho, I see your point, if we take area of oceans at around 360 mil sq km's, and spread 2.6 mil cubic km's onto it (estimated water on Greenland). (in case nothing dissipates nor get absorbed) it would be around 7 m raise in height. (if i havent screwed up math) :D tho as you raise height you get more area ('cause sphere), i'm lazy to calculate, lets ballpark it at around 2m . (did i f*up the math?)

That thing about more rain doesn't make sense for me at all, oceans are largest water surfaces, so most of the evaporation will come out of them and then water will flow back to them, so its the cycle of the same water in essence. Further, South pole won't melt in this scenario, and North pole is already floating in ocean, so it melting wont change a thing also. (well if there is any amount of ice supported by ground then it will) but not to extent stated. My next thought is Greenland, its a huge area with considerable ice/snow cover. But, it's called Greenland (which implies to me it was not covered in snow when found :D) So it seems to me I'll have to find different solution to ocean level rising.

The thing with climate change is that some areas will have extreme droughts, and others will have to abandon their home cause it's under water. The scary thing is that both extremes can happen at the same time.	UCdqaO725ZgwgGtDYQU3wm3A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdqaO725ZgwgGtDYQU3wm3A	1	UgiILtvQUt3t1ngCoAEC	Bojan Tesin

If climate records are being broken from the 1860s doesn&#39;t that mean the weather was generally the same back then? Also in order for sea level to raise a significant amount all the oceans around the world have to go up too right? Duuhhh. Seems to me like there is no where near enough ice in the world that could potentially melt that would cause a huge change in sea level. Plus the ice already in the water displaces the volume it would potentially become if it melted.

UghbYFUjr51MR3gCoAEC	1	1	2016-12-22 22:06:38	Denise Thasder	Of the 3% of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, humans have contributed only 4%. That&#39;s 4% of 3% of carbon dioxide we have produced. I think the major problem is methane production by cows and oceans, which is much worse for the planet as it adds to the greenhouse gases. But perhaps even that isn&#39;t the problem; maybe it&#39;s just the Earth going through its natural cycle of armed and cooler climates. We&#39;ve only been keeping records of the climate for 135 years, which isn&#39;t even a blip in the existence of humans and the planet. I don&#39;t agree with pollution at all; it kills species off, which is negative for the planets genetic diversity. China&#39;s rivers are so polluted a dolphin species was killed off, but it wasn&#39;t carbon dioxide that did it, instead it was the plastic debris and chemical wastes. If we become more responsible with our wastes we can help the planet, but climate change will still happen, as it always has.

Professors that agreed with you? Gosh, you'll have to let me read the thesis you wrote for that doctorate sometime. Fun fact: I've been in a college biology course where the professor actually had a topic about evolution vs creationism. Perhaps random college professors aren't a great go-to against the entirety of the scientific community, and, well, blatant fact. The climate changes, that's a fact. The climate is warming, that's a fact. The ONLY discussion is how much influence humans have on the quickening warming occurring. There is no actual discussion on if it happens; there is only discussion on how much humans contribute.

The earth average temperature was far above what it is now and there was little to no carbon emissions.<br />Before the economic boom of the 1940s in America, we produced less carbon emissions, yet between 1930-1940, the temperature increased a ton and it was slowly rising after 1940. Now, if you think carbon emissions are what causing the eat the temperature to rise, wouldn&#39;t that have been the opposite?<br />I&#39;m very liberal, but burning fuel isn&#39;t the issue.

The Little Ice Age very solidly grounded, the skepticism isn't as apparent as for, say, the quantum theory. With using those records, starting from 1880 when mass industry really begun allows us to see that the global temperature rarely if ever shrunk over the course of that history. Obviously global temperatures aren't constant, ever. However the rate at which the Earth is warming with no expected mass-volcanic activity to back it up (like during the Permian and Triassic extinction events, and rapid periods of global warming in history are usually caused by large amounts of volcanic activity), there is either an undiscovered anomaly emitting the CO2 that scientists are certain are contributing to global warming, or it is human industry. What most scientists agree on though, is that CO2 traps heat, lots of CO2 is emitted by factories and agriculture, global temperatures are rising, and that we are not living in a period of volatile volcanic activity or being struck by a comet.

It's how we discovered the Little Ice Age, the Medieval Warm Period, previous Ice Ages, estimated temperatures during the Mesozoic period, and basically any time in Earth's history when it had an atmosphere. Meanwhile there is a phenomenon called the Little Ice Age, that makes up most of the high Middle Ages and Renaissance period, and the Medieval Warm Period that occurred before the Little Ice Age. Industrial-age global temperatures are significantly higher than estimated Medieval Warm Period temperatures, which means that our recovering from this Little Ice Age is abnormally warm.

Switching energy can destroy a nation economically. Any sort of "change" to facilitate a more eco friendly society has to start from the individual, i.e not leaving the lights on when it is sunny outside, using a bicycle or walking to work if it is close, recycling one's trash, eating less and healthier, and other lifestyle choices that should also be voluntary rather than forced. While a state cannot force change on its people, its people can willingly accept and make change themselves...it's just that we are missing the "willingly" part. While we will ultimately never "save" the Earth, we can reduce our consumption to pre-Industrial levels while still living comfortable lives with modern medicine and modern entertainment.

It's all about money when all is said and done. How could we even begin changing the acidity of the oceans? Aside from the obvious and not pouring pollution into it! I am a bit skeptical of how global warming / climate change is being handled. Rather than investing heavily into alternative energy and a more effective way of harnessing nuclear power it just seems that the money from the green programmes just go back into the same thing. I'd like to see an alternative way to harness nuclear as the current method widely used is used for harvesting weapons grade uranium for use in nuclear warheads rather than just for energy production..

It said 2 degree's was the MINIMUM it would raise if we could stop it completely, while we have enough oil drilled out of the ground to raise it 10 degrees. That's only what isn't in the ground right now. Where I am, we have summers that get to be 96 degrees Fahrenheit. That'd raise to 106 degrees, which is closer to desert level temperatures than what it should be here. We have nearly 200 years worth of temperature data saved and we can tell that it's gradually getting hotter each year. Adding in lists of plant and animal life which have went extinct in the last 200 years, life right now is far from thriving. We're going through a mass extinction period right now. In the future? Yeah, it will probably balance out and life will take rout again. But it won't be the life that we know about right now. And again, that was millions of years ago when CO2 was that high, way before humans existed. Plus, "0 degree weather" is again, COLD. It's easy to take care of being cold, not hot for a human.

Humans also couldn't survive back then, and life was vastly different from what it is today. If CO2 levels get that high again, life will once again be vastly different. As for the Ice Age: It's easier to deal with the cold than it is warmth. With cold, you continue to pile on more furs and the such allowing a person to not freeze. Warmth on the other hand, you only have so much that you can take off before you overheat and die. The world might be better off, because rising CO2 levels would end up making humans go extinct after a few hundred or thousand years allowing nature to take back over once again.

Because there legitimately are a lot of conspiracies in the world, but every time a conspiracy theorist is tasked with explaining a relatively straightforward shady dealing, not only do they convolute it into something Occam&#39;s Razor would shatter on, but they end up implicitly trusting someone with as much if not more money and power than the group they&#39;re accusing.<br />&quot;Climate Change is a conspiracy from China to shut down our industry; they just bribed all those scientists!&quot;<br />Right, let&#39;s not believe them; let&#39;s believe the narrative that conveniently benefits the giant fossil fuel industry who are openly bribing our politicians. I&#39;m sure they&#39;re honest!<br />&quot;Hillary has some weird dealings with her emails; WHAT IS SHE HIDING?! Also something about pizza and child pornography&quot;<br />Right, the guy who worked with an imperialist foreign government to mess with the election, to the point that even the machines themselves need to be investigated? The fact that he&#39;s making no effort to separate his business from his new job? The thinly veiled threats he&#39;s made against the first amendement (that thing I thought you people liked)?

I admit that climate change is a thing but it&#39;s not happening as fast as you say it is. So really what you are doing is fear mongering. It is really not see fault that we have nothing else to replace it and because nothing esle is as efficient except nuclear power but we all know how libreals feel about that. It is also not equal blame all round China and 2nd/3rd world countries use coal and oil the most and it doesn&#39;t help that we stop (try in the case of china) them using fossil fuels but by doing that we are stopping their industry from growing ,so they can have indepence from us. So in the end we ethier continue to stop 3rd worlds to become firsts and figure out level when everyone else has nearish same tech or to keep other people down so you can feel good and what it comes down to libreals using climate change as a weapon against others who could compete with them or to viute signal to others that they are good in some where even though overall your preventing us solving the problem and hurting mostly africans in the process. They also try and level you anti science if you disagree in anyway.	UCKxXO-oZjL_ZXZI_61GIogw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKxXO-oZjL_ZXZI_61GIogw	0

Humans won't die out. However, notice that wasn't said in the video. They merely said that these climatic events would be stronger and more frequent. You ask whether those predictions are correct, they are. They didn't state the frequency, or the magnitude, save for the rising of the oceans. That, however, is very well known. The oceans have been mapped by satellite with high accuracy, just as the ice caps, and very basic physics can tell you what happens when a % of the ice caps melts. You plug in your numbers and get your predictions. They may be off by a bit, but that's not the point. There will be change for the worse, that's a fact and enough to be worried. Also, Science is only consensus. A scientific observation is only a fact when it is corroborated by other scientists, read they have the same opinion on the observation or not of the phenomena. Unlike in Politics where you ask regular citizens who barely pay attention, in Science you are asking scientists that are following rigurious procedures in order to give their opinion. So, to conclude: the video is exactly right.	UCLsBGUR4e_ulp6Lm-dc-BzQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLsBGUR4e_ulp6Lm-dc-BzQ	1	UgjF9xx8M5aOZXgCoAEC	Hardcore Bunny

That is all it is, Adam if he was truly a skeptic would call out both sides for false predictions. Republicans and Democrats. I agree the Earth is getting warmer Republicans are wrong about that, but Democrats treat is like it is a comet heading to destroy the Earth. Both have been proven false and it is time we accept the falsehoods and come to a truth that is proven and can maybe reach a 98% agreement among scientists.

And Australia, Japan, India and China also got a bunch of these scientists, that has confirmed the same. You has already show me that your vision of science is very limited and reduced just by people who can speak your language. That doesn't mean they don't exist. Have you already say that China has a small corporate influence? OK, have you ever seen stuff with the "made in China" etiquette? Do you know the reason? Because China has one of the largest industries in the world! And yes, they also have the most polluted cities and are having a negative impact on the global warming. And furthermore, I honestly don't understand when you say that the liberal party is anti corporation, when in Europe they are considered right wing, precisely because they support the corporations. Not in an extreme way like republicans, but they do...and again, I guaranteed that liberals scientists of Europe don't feel sympathy for them. They can't be influenced by them and they still support the idea of global warming. And just in case, scientist support things not because they like it, its because they made independent researchs in their universities and got the same conclusions. Guy, you are need more information, try to look for the scientist of other countries. This is not just a "white liberal thing".

The theory of evolution as we know it today is vastly different from what Darwin imagines it to be, it was added onto over time from theories that was disproven, proven, and reasoned by advances in scinetific field.

We will never have the freedom to do whatever we want. I'm open to all proposals as long as scientific consensus isn't ignored. Let's say you don't want to reduce CO2 emissions. First world countries will most likely be less affected than poorer regions. This is because rich nations already have great control over their landscape. This is especially true for Europe. The Netherlands already live below sea level. They can deal with higher tides. Germany was once a swap. If there is less rain, drainage can be reduced. If there is more rain, drainage can be increased. And so on. However, large and poorly urbanized countries will be hit hard (they already are). This shows how unfair live is. They didn't produce the CO2 but have to deal with the consequences. Can you then really blame them for migrating to first world countries? I think that reducing C02 emissions is easier than many people think. We have plenty of alternatives. Plus fossil fuels will run out. And reliance on resources like oil is already producing needless conflicts. Think about how much those have already cost us. Let's push innovation forward. So much is possible if we are willing to invest now. It is expensive but let's be real: We have the money.

The implied actions also demand that we sacrifice parts of our way of life. People have the right to disagree. Unfortunately science and political agendas are too often mixed. You must not deny scientific consensus because you don't want to change your way of life. You should admit to rather face the consequences of climate change. Instead scientific facts are denied.

I never said anything about cold, and just because the planet is warming doesn't mean that everything warms, or warms equally. Some climate deniers stay quiet when 2016 is the hottest in recorded history, and yet when a year isn't as got they say that climate change is wrong. It's ridiculous. Hurricanes were excepted to be more powerful, but less frequent. Hurricane sandy showed a climate change hurricane. And hurricane Mathew didn't go the expected path because of the climate change-induced weather. Sea levels have certainly not decreased, I question your sources. Once in a century or millennium floods are happening once a year. The rainforest has decreased 70% what it was, and climate scientists never said that the ozone hole will or expected it to fry anyone. And the ozone hole is a good example of when a problem caused by us can be recognized and fixed.

Every individual should take responsibility for his or her own actions. As I said before, the U.S. is horrible for pollution. No doubt about that. But everyone should stand up and stand together to fix the problem, not just point fingers at each other. The blame game has never caused anything good to happen. As a matter of fact, blaming each other has lead to war, genocide, persecution and other nasties. The world has to put all differences aside and collaborate against the common enemy here: ourselves. Americans and citizens of other countries have to see the error of our ways and work towards improvement or nothing will ever significantly change. Yes, America's involvement should not be overlooked but everyone else shouldn't be using it as a shadow to cloak their own involvement. Instead, admit your country (and maybe even you, yourself) has had a helping hand in the destruction of environment and work toward fixing your piece of the problem. If everyone, including the U.S, do this then the Earth should last us many centuries to come.

We only have 10 years left before we release too much greenhouse gas to go back, and Trump is about to waste 4 to 8. The best chance we have is to start working on technologies to protect farms, rivers and cities, the key regions we need for our continued survival. It will cost trillions, but the alternative is to lose every human life, and 95% of animal lives, over the next 1,000 years.

That's why it's been 15+ years since we've seen demos of working prototypes, some occasional early adopters (like the city of Vancouver for the Olympics) but virtually everything gets shutdown because of the same issues. It costs more to produce hydrogen than how much Energy you get back by alot. It requires a lot of platinum as a catalyst. It's a safety hazard to store a vehicle in a shop. The amount of refills vs travel time is annoying. It'll keep having limited use going forward, like the army's H2-ZX2 and powering hospitals.

Molten salt reactors are being proposed/tested right now, and they create energy that not only doesn't create toxic byproducts but can even use up pre-existing toxic waste for energy. They are also a lot more efficient with how much energy we can harness from them. This is the form that I envision the future being built on.

And believe me, the U.S. does PLENTY of messed up things. Since the oil and natural gas companies have so much money, they can afford to lobby as hard as they do, affecting the course of policy and law changes. Not a very democratic system, huh? Of course those companies don't give a crap about our ecosystem or future, they just want to line their pockets even further than they already have. I wish we'd take a stand and demand for sustainable energy sources NOW. We've proven before we can overcome all the bologna that shady politicians try to do against what the people want (SOPA, anti-LBGT laws, etc.), so why not here when this concerns ALL of us? It's sort of a baffling concept. I wish humans could consider the long-term more easily and do something NOW while it's still an achievable task instead of wait until it's already happened and it'll be next to impossible to fix.

For states with lots of rivers, go upstream so that there's nobody there and dam it. Wind can help cover some peak hours. Base of your energy should be nuclear where there is a lack of hydro or reliable solar. Hold you over until fusion comes along.

Ugjpvi6gasAtjngCoAEC.8Mnq1PHSoeR8Mo-Rc5j1Yj		1	2016-12-22 22:15:42	ReddwarfIV	@Michael Zhang With respect to hydro, they mean that by creating a dam you will also create a lake. If there is housing behind the place you are damming, it will have to be bought out or evacuated. As for wind and solar, their intermittency is an issue because of a lack of energy storage. They can _maybe_ cover peak power requirements, but to use them extensively means you will be wasting a lot of power when the wind is blowing properly. Germany is having significant issues with this. Their CO2 output has gone _up_ since they shut down the nuclear plants because they are now reliant on coal when wind fails them. The only reliable renewables are tidal (requires nearby shoreline) and high-altitude wind (requires your nation be below a jet stream, and will be dangerous for aircraft.)

Fukushima was bad location + design + natural disaster. Three Mile Island ostensibly is the only one that is an example of an actual failure. Keep in mind that three mile island was nearly 3 decades ago. Safety procedures will have drastically improved as well as the reliability of technology. Failsafes will be designed around it. These are all lessons that we can use to improve rather than shy away from nuclear. Wind and solar are currently intermittent yes, but there's no sense NOT doing it where you can. Hydro can put thousands out of home? What are you talking about. Most of Canada is hydro powered. With the exception of the prairies and Ontario, Canada is hydro powered. The prairies burn coal. Ontario gets most of its energy from nuclear with Hydro contributing about a quarter. In fact, we get so much energy we actually sell our electricity to the States. From up here in BC all the way down to California baby.	UCypLT1xvGyJc9FUm1mpIdPA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCypLT1xvGyJc9FUm1mpIdPA	1	Ugjpvi6gasAtjngCoAEC	Corn Kopp

Chernobyl was a result of the combination of badly designed reactors, Soviet emphasis on making unqualified workers do the jobs of nuclear engineers, unsatisfactory supervision, improper carrying out of the safety test and a bad reaction to a bad situation (shouldn't have shoved the control rods into the reactor so fast.) And nuclear has _still_ killed less people per kilowatt-hour produced than _solar_. It is the _only_ viable high-load clean energy source not reliant on special geography (looking at you, hydro).

They conveniently leave out the fact that CO2 levels used to be much much higher than they are today, way back in the times of the dionsaurs. So people will say "See, CO2 levels are really high"... yeah, sure, if you never look further back than the 1800s. But as I said, the rising CO2 levels is an issue for us, and the rate of increase is much faster than in the past.

The odd thing is, even if you don&#39;t believe the science and the evidence showing global warming to be a fact of life, it still makes sense to transfer over to sustainable energy sources. Regardless of your views toward climate change it is a fact, pure and simple, that carbon and fossil fuels lead to air pollution which lowers the quality of life in the regions where it accumulates. Cities wind up with brown air and unpleasant smells. All it takes is a single trip to the redwoods (or other remote camping destination) to notice the distinct change in air quality. Simply put it&#39;s a pleasant change (unless you have allergies). Now personally, I enjoy having transportation on demand, electricity, home entertainment, hot and cold running water, a fan on hot days and heating on cold days. These are things I&#39;d be reluctant to give up. Fortunately we don&#39;t have to. Technological advances in green energy have come a long way and are advancing by leaps and bounds on a daily basis. Clinging to fossil fuels and carbon fuels, which are finite resources, simply doesn&#39;t make sense in the long term.

And the end of the world isn't in a year, it's a progressively worsening problem, but it's not tsunamis in NYC. Let's address problems that we can solve at the moment and those that are cost-effective. No need to exaggerate a problem to apocalyptic proportions. That's one of the reasons why people don't want to accept global warming, because it marginalizes the very immediate issues we have now. In 100 years, when Africans and South East Asian peoples are as rich as Dutchman and Americans, are they going to be thankful we saved them from a foot of sea level rising or sad that we didn't use our limited resources to address the problems of their grandfathers? You can't expect to solve global warming if Malaria is still prevalent and if food shortages are still a thing. We need to be smart with the limited amount of resources we have. It's an exercise in futility.	UCRXWBzWj8Hkv-TPPuVFGcAQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRXWBzWj8Hkv-TPPuVFGcAQ	1	UggETEgTNRYKWHgCoAEC	rosenjcb

Taking statistics about fatalities from the past doesn't matter. If there was a bomb that would go off in 3 days exactly, would you say that the bomb is not a threat because nobody has been killed by it yet?

Point is there are pros and cons and only highlighting the cons makes it a more serious problem than it immediately is. If you asked someone who was 100 years old today. What would they say the worst travesty was? Polio or the global sea level rising of a foot?

Not saying that the pros outweigh the cons, but if you act like it's all cons, gloom and doom, and that we're all going to die, then the problem won't be resolved.

Now for an educational one, if simplified: Imagine the air currents in the atmosphere is a highway full of cars. That highway is open and the cars are driving merrily along it at their different times. These highways are maintained by the road company (the polar icecaps). When the company changes their policies and infrastructure (icecaps melting), it affects the highways. They shut down highways while they're building new ones, changing the route that cars have to travel. But unfortunately they are unable to provide alternate routes for the cars, so the cars have to stand still on the highways until there is a new path built for them to travel. That's basically how it works. The melting icecaps change the air currents that control temperatures around the world. Ordinarily, these currents sometimes bring warm weather to a region and sometimes bring cold weather, but this always passes because the air is in motion. Thanks to climate change, sometimes these weathers get stuck in one place because the currents are cut off/rerouted by other interfering currents caused by the meltdown. So when this happens, the weather conditions cannot change and one of two things occur: temperatures rise to unusual levels, or they plummet. The longer they remain in stasis, the hotter/colder will the weather become. This is how you can experience snow in a desert, for instance. Climate change is a direct result of the warming of the Earth, and even though you can call it a "global warming," the way it affects the air currents that control the weather will cause sometimes extreme colds. So that is why we get warmer summers, but typically colder winters. Spells of extreme cold are a symptom of global warming/climate change, despite a commonly held belief that it getting colder = climate change is a hoax. Idk if I explained it well or if the analogy was sufficient, but the point is that we are heating up, even if it feels colder!

Some people were even able to feel cold at 125 degrees Celsius (257 F) which is a temperature that normal humans are only barely able to withstand for 20 minutes. Some people say that 125 C is the highest temperature the human body is able to withstand but I disagree because there is a time limit. For me the highest temperature a human is able to live in is about 70 C (158 F), meaning that the Earth won't get warm enough to kill us from sheer heat anytime soon but what will happen is that the water cycle will be disrupted and basically it will stop raining in some places and start raining in some other places and the amount of rain in certain places might increase or decrease, this will obviously affect agriculture and water distribution. There are solutions however such as indoor agriculture (Pink houses) and Sea water extraction systems, they are quite expensive but I believe that they are the definitive future.

My gene pool is awful too, but what really swayed me towards not wanting to have biological children is the dreadful future that would await them. Climate change, wars for water and land above sea-level, fearful people falling prey to fascist demagogues who may even steer us into a nuclear war (just listen to what Trump non-chalantly said today about a new nuclear arms race), the total abolishment of logic, reason, enlightenment, science, reality, kindness and mercy in everyday discourse, social injustice and cruelty against anyone who dares to be an "Other" or refuse to subscribe to dogmatic black-and-white thinking. That being coupled with so many orphaned children in the wars of the Middle East. I hope I'll be able to adopt a few human beings, who are already on this Earth and didn't have much love and luck in their lives yet. No need to add any additional humans to that catastrophe that is our world. It's so sad. Mankind has so much potential for greatness and look what we're doing instead...

Building new e-car factories, telling 600,000 VW owners to buy new cars, most of which will get half the MPG thus doubling* the amount of C02 the owner makes, are all steps in the wrong direction. *it's more than double since diesels emit 15% less C02 than gasoline vehicles.

They predict this cause it's a obvious conclusion. More heat causes more evaporation which fuels storms more. The increase heat however make it harder for cold fronts to make a dent but when they do it tends to be a stronger storm.

All plants eat C02 (and produce oxygen); it's their primary source of food. Now you know why your lawn doesn't sink 2" each year from the grass 'eating' all the dirt. If every person on earth planted 10 trees the C02 issue would be reversed in 40 years, problem solved. NO ONE MAKERS MONEY OFF OF YOU if you do that.

I forgot the exact number) million square kilometers to just 211,000 square kilometers in 2016. That's not growing. That's shrinking. And yes, you can point to seasonal satellite maps that show the ice cap growing and shrinking though the year but they don't mean anything because the ice cap does grow and shrink through seasons. But the yearly average size of the ice cap is shrinking.	UCFKJEPJN-Eo--CNoUnMrZ6Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFKJEPJN-Eo--CNoUnMrZ6Q	1	UgidOV8nH-At03gCoAEC	Kurtis C.

I don't think so, everything is suppose to happen very slowly, and the world won't just be destroyed all of a sudden like the movie The Day After Tomorrow. It'll take several decades for sea levels to rise even to the point where people need to move out of beach houses, polar ice caps are still increasing in size, and Arctic sea ice is not melting at the super fast rate that people like al gore thought it would (he thought it would be totally gone by now, but there's still a lot), a lot of predictions by al gore and scientists either didn't happen or the timeline keeps getting pushed back, and I'd be most worried about droughts and wildfires but there isn't conclusive enough proof that global warming has a big impact on those type of events	UCRr4Nr1FOOqUzY1Z-uWEZQg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRr4Nr1FOOqUzY1Z-uWEZQg	1	UgidOV8nH-At03gCoAEC	Kurtis C.

Have you ever calculated the volume of our atmosphere relative to how much pollution there is? Then subtract that plants literally live off of C02 as does much of the ocean's algae, which will also prosper more with more C02. Electric cars have literally have 5,000 to 10,000 less parts than gasoline cars, and the parts they have do not require all the casting, forging, and machining that gasoline engines do (very few exceptions). There's no transmission, exhaust-fuel-ignition systems, the engine has 30 parts not 300, the engine computer does not need to manage 20 sensors, spark plugs, shift timing, knock/ping, and there's no transmission computer. All this GW hype just so you will spend an extra $5000 to $50,000 on a car that should be half as expensive as a gasoline car. Welcome to the real world.

Also the largest nuclear bombs in our current world are thousands of times more powerful than the ones dropped on Japan. With dictators in the world We are our worse enemies. Trust Nukes are worse. When a nuclear numb is dropped YOU have to ask the question, Should I try to live?, A nuclear bomb wouldn't just harm you the radiation you DESTROY our entire family tree. Your kids and there kids would be riddled with genetic diseases for many years. Nukes are worse!!!

The earth has been cooling for millions of years. The air had more carbon dioxide than today. There were faster temperature&nbsp; increases 10,000 years ago and it was hotter 130,000 years ago (antarctic and greenland ice sample). Florida was hotter and underwater during the Oligocene Epoch.&nbsp; Nasa was lying and now its more honest. Noaa was lying. Al gore's scientist was lying. Well, i have work to do but i will leave you with this graph to help you learn.

Though the cost of solar per kwh is massively different by location, but for many places it would become cheaper for personal solar on grid then buying power from the grid. Off grid will became cheaper with new battery tech. By 2030, I would guess it will be cheaper in the long term for off grid solar then on grid power in America.

And the problem that they say with the ice melting is that the ice reflex UV rays out of our atmosphere but the carbon is holding it causing the ice to melt in the long run making the glove warmer. But if that's the case why is Antarctica gaining land mass everybody's worried about the polar bears up north but the Penguins down south are doing great	UCi0XgGMvz2k69cuRio9Gayw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi0XgGMvz2k69cuRio9Gayw	1	UgidOV8nH-At03gCoAEC	Kurtis C.

What I am guess you have seen in Greenland ice sheet data on the last 10,000 years. But Greenland's data =/ global data. A shift in the ocean currents can cause a massive difference in temperatures. Vancouver is at a lower latitude then London, but London is warmer. This is mostly to do with the fact that sea water near London is considerable warmer then sea water near Vancouver. So a shift in sea currents can cause a massive change in local temperatures, but does not change global temperatures much.

Over ten billion dollars moves from the government to scientists to study global warming and on top of that. Guys like Al Gore in other global warming Advocates.put their hands out for fundraising. And if you were me started questioning whether global warming was real. That would mean less money for all of these scammers. There's plenty of evidence out there for you to see the truth. Look up any temperature graph for the last ten thousand years. And you'll see far hotter and colder times. Also the original scientist in 1940 Roger revelle. Who did the initial research had said they don't know what anything means. It's just a lot of theory he even said that in Omni magazine.

Global conflicts have cause that every year for the past 10 years while the world is in one of the most peaceful times in human history (as measure by conflict deaths/world population). There is basically no risk of destroying humanity. None. There is no way that climate change threatens humankind as a whole. This does not hold true for nuclear war or earth being hit by an large asteroid, both could endanger humankind. It could threaten to kill a lot of the people on earth, but realistically more like 5-10% at most.

The ozone layer back in the seventies and eighties was the same argument that they make today about global warming. The ozone was supposed to widen so much that it was going to make the planet uninhabitable. They made documentaries and movies about it all the time. And people donated all of their money to help save the ozone. All of those scammers have moved on to better scams. And we don't ever hear about the ozone anymore. Because there was never any problem to begin with. it was just fear mongering to scam money out of people. And if you don't believe it global warming has replaced that.

But just because we've never experienced drastic climate change since the ice age, doesn't make it less likely/dangerous to our immediate future. Nukes are a slightly unknown. They certainly are capable of being far more dangerous (and we should minimize that danger) but that doesn't mean we should focus exclusively on this one danger. Finally, there is a complete lack of coverage in the media about climate change, so I don't know why you are claiming to be witnessing "hysteria". Also, astroids are not so dangerous to us. We're tracking most objects large enough to do real damage. None are likely to hit us in the near or far future. If one was, we'd almost certainly notice it long before it hit us. The reasons for the mini-ice age, medieval warming, and previous warm/cold periods are largely known, or at least very strong theories exist. Most of these were not global climate events but local ones. Solar activity, Milankovitch cycles, etc. None of these have warmed the earth as much as we are very likely headed (assuming 4+ degrees of change)... at least since the formation of complex organisms. 4-6 degrees of warming may be far more damaging than the coming ice age in 20k years. "The media" did not decide it was CO2, the scientific community did. And there is a ton of consensus in the scientific literature on what causes climate changes (a bunch of different things) and there is very strong consensus that this time it is man-made CO2. If you feel I'm mistaken, please get back to me with sources. I prefer peer-reviewed research, but will accept blogs from arm-chair scientists, as I suspect that's the best you can deliver.

The thing I find most alarming is the industries that have sprouted out making billions of dollars off regulations by litigation, taxes and other means. Mainly from CO2. Why is no one talking about livestock farming? Massive deforestation, water consumption greater than all humans combined, methane pollution (which is over 20 times more powerful than CO2 and is an actual poison where as CO2 is needed for life) and HUUUGE amounts of food lost that is multitudes higher than food gained. It's raises questions. But all they have to do nowadays is say we are tough on one pollutant and everyone jumps on board without thinking critically about the accuser. I am not a climate denier btw.

UgidOV8nH-At03gCoAEC.8MnoLYfVNbd8Mq0Xb71tFq		0	2016-12-23 17:03:44	Reyori	@joe weisenberger A global temperature rise of ''only'' 1.3 degrees celsius can mean that in some places it gets then degrees hotter in summer, while staying more or less the same in other regions or the winters staying more or less the same. But here in Switzerland the snow comes later and less every year and since 2015 nearly every month broke the warmth record. But back to the 1.3 global temperature rise: If it gets 10 degrees hotter in switzerland every summer but stays nearly the same in the rest of the world the global temperature rise would be like 0.00x degrees. But for our country it would be catastrophic. And since many countries in africa and some places in west america had some hard droughts those last 2-3 years I think that's already happening. It's like when you would drive a car for 2 hours, but driving 300km/h for 5 minutes between and the "average" speed may still be 40km/h but the effects of those 5 minutes could be desastrous. As for the those climate change "experts"... I trust the scientific results, but not really those experts that seem to know how the future will be. As anyone can call himself an expert today without knowing anything about the subject they are sometimes as good as fortunetellers.... sorry to say that...

Anything the media uses as “proof” either cites irrelevant articles or ignores the whole body of literature and snips a phrase and exploits it. Contest this with Mr. “Scientist” Al Gore and the media who were saying back in 2008 the polar ice caps were going to melt away before 2016. Not only has this been proven false, Green Peace tried to say the polar bear populations were decreasing in Canada and Alaska. The UN, who has Saudi Arabia on its human rights council, is as credible to scientific research as a plumber is at rebuilding cars.. The UN council on climate change was hosted by an economist, NOT a trained meteorologist with actual credentials. Preventing African countries from development because it will raise greenhouse gases proves how the racist and child molesting members of the UN are. When morons pretend to act as “trained” scientists and claim the science is out and case closed, it further proves how ignorant they are. Science by definition, NEVER uses the language of case closed. Science does not work like a money grabbing politician, it works by experimentation and theory building, always changing. Science is not a liberal tax ploy to line the pockets of “enlightened” liberals who exploit idiots like you. Al Gore who left politics in 2001 with $2 million and now has amassed a healthy living with his climate change nonsense and “green energy” government funded investments by tax payers, is worth $200 million. I also have to laugh at the useful idiots (Lenin’s term) who talk of overpopulation using the exact same scare mongering they used back in the early 1900s.

Or the other warming periods? The ones that led us to predict another warming event to take place in the 2000s? Hate to burst your bubble, but climate change is a part of the earth interacting with the sun. Our emissions may have contributed, but the emissions in the early Italian Renaissance consisted of methane being released by cows, and the warming period happened all the same. This new warming period would still have happened if we never advanced technology to the industrial revolution, all our emissions are doing is giving us a scapegoat. We just took on the blame, while allowing naturalists to pin the blame on new technology and big businesses.

However one of the most used definitions is a period of ice sheets covering the northern and southern hemispheres. So we are still in it but leaving one that lasted about 10000-15000 years (since the last one ended just 15000 years ago). The holocene, where we are in now however is considered an interglacial period (warming-up period between ice ages), so as I said the earth IS warming up naturally, but with us humans a bit faster than it actually should... and I personally think that the main problem is not only the temperature, but that we altered the landscape with our fields, roding forests and cities a lot.

There is no conclusive evidence to back climate change denier's claims, because real scientists proved how we impact the climate change that is happening today because of our greenhouse gasses, fossil fuels/oil, methane, etc.  Stephen hawking himself cited it and our impact on it as a threat to our civilization.  So quite laughably, climate change denier's have nothing to base their arguments on except for a irrational bias of hoping for the prolonging of a unsustainable societal model that allowed them to exploit/hate others for their own gain.

The reason people call it global warming and there are many lies around it is because of environmentalists wanting to lower pollution and protect the environment , while the cause is just and correct the end does not justify the means. It would be better to have a more in-depth look and see what really is happening to the environment and see if humans can infect control the situation for the better rather than worse.

Also in the warmer period there were far more forests producting oxygen and removing co2 from the atmosphere while also cooling the landmass by creating a ''rain cycle'", hence the name rain forests (the water from the leaves vaporises and then rains down again, cooling the place). But today the crop fields just dry out because there is no such cycle and the useful soil erodes away, and cities with cars and pc's running don't cool down the area either. So if you don't live in a forest... it will get a lot drier and warmer.	UCM9OojavYamW76ubC5kEDUg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCM9OojavYamW76ubC5kEDUg	1	UgidOV8nH-At03gCoAEC	Kurtis C.

Climate change is real we should all know that, but the cause is still somewhat up for debate even though the media seems sold on carbon(one of the less effective greenhouse gasses). All of the other inner planets have experienced warming similar to earth over the last few decades so clearly there is more than just human actions at play, but more importantly we are not helpless to change the climate back to however we want it. We now have multiple ways to effectively suck the carbon out of the atmosphere in cost effective ways, like adding iron to certain regions on the ocean to increase plankton levels(this also increases sea life in the area like fish and krill). There is currently however a world ban on geoengineering even though we know it would be both more cost effective than a rapid move to renewables and that it could not only stop the warming but could reverse it if we wanted. The thing that bothers me the most is the complete lack of historical knowledge by most people, things like the Mini ice age that took hold in Europe that led to crop failures that in turn led to the French revolution that in turn led to the American revolution with support from the French (all long before the industrial revolution). The simple truth is that there is no consensus in the scientific world on why there is climate change, the consensus is that there is climate change, but then anyone can figure that out. One example would be the amount of old port towns that are now inland, the amount of ancient cities that are now under the ocean, the fact Greenland was indeed green and growing crops when the Vikings got there... climate change happens and carbon may be a part of that but most likely it's not the primary cause. Oh and to top it all off, now some scientists are worrying we might be heading towards another Mini ice age as the sun may be entering a period of cooling.

It has the advantage of being a relatively slow process while being somewhat predictable. This being said, climate change is very real and it is most probably man made. Science has yet again given us very useful tools enabling us to understand what the heck we are actually doing. It is very important not to blow things out of proportion. Otherwise you just vindicate your critics. I have heard that climate change is already costing humanity about 100 billion dollars a year. And I can easily see how. Add a drought here, a flood there and a hurricane on top of it and the damages add up quickly. Especially if one considers political effects like war and refugees. However, earth's annual gdp is around 80,000 billion dollars a year, so 0.1% or so is lost to damages due to climate change. This figure will rise undoubtedly but it is at least debatable if the benefits of burning coal outweigh the negative effects of climate change.

Entire regions are becoming uninhabitable (lack of freshwater and fertile soil due to extended droughts and erosion) and its population is emigrating to other countries (example: people from rural areas of Central and West Africa are emigrating to North Africa and Europe). The refugee crisis is nothing compared to the massive immigration that climate change will cause. Add that to the unemployment rise that will be caused by AI automation and you'll have the perfect recipe for turmoil and chaos. If humanity doesn't address these severe challenges, our children and their children may never expect to live up to the same living standards we're living.

The estimates for uranium and one other core that I can't name at the moment is between five and twenty years if energy sources were transferred to that sector. The reason uranium is used is due to its energy output and longevity. What number of years or even decades does it keep us off of fossil fuels? I'm extremely happy that people here recognize fossil fuels as something to be discontinued, but the ignorance on nuclear power is disconcerting.

Nuclear fission depends on uranium, correct? And we have a finite amount of that. At current consumption rates, it would take twenty years for us to be out of fissionable material. It's not sustainable. Solar has its issues, but at least way more than a source that dries up that quickly and leaves behind toxins. I suggest you research cradle to cradle along with the idea that waste is food, if you're into sustainability issues.

There is nothing clean about needing to store barrels upon reinforced barrels of toxic radioactive sludge. Politicians aren't the only ones without "proper education" on this subject. I'm not attempting to be mean, but this is truly making me angry that people believe things like you are saying. Fusion could never be a sustainable source of energy, because we don't have enough of the fissionable element here on earth--baring meteorite mining! If we tried to power, the USA for example, purely with nuclear power it would last maybe 20 years at current energy use levels--that are still increasing. I don't want to rant, but sustainability issues with energy and society is something that I just focused in with an entire semester with my professors and fellow researchers. I would like it if more people dug beyond and questioned everything, including what one learns online or in school.

Nuclear waste is already having a hard time trying to find viable real estate to store underground. It has been facing the same problem with land fills when plastics and materials cannot decompose. They cannot find enough land to bury it. Second, earthquakes and other underground problems is a huge risk to radioactive leakage. Who can guarentee it wont leak? No one.

Two, with nuclear power you always have to be worried about what if. What if there is an earthquake or a terrorist attack or just a reactor breach that causes leakage of radioactive materials? That is no way to live if you live close to a reactor. But I agree that we do need a non carbon producing form of baseline power.

I remember the last time I really sat down with the viability of renewables thinking "Ok, how can we make this work" ...and then I hit the materials/labor problem (5X-10X the materials/labor of nuclear ...its a fool's errand right out of the gate if you're looking to shift fast since it would take many years of the entire concrete/steel output of the planet) So ditch your faith and look up some estimates of pre-industrial buffalo populations and the other information.

OH, and we have known how to do this for 40+ years. MOX fuel reactors. Look them up. Also nuclear is so much more efficient than oil that you could easily pay for a small army when you have replaced all your oil workers. The US is finally building their first MOX fuel reactor, 40+ years late, because people in the US and certain other countries are terrified of nuclear when they SHOULD be terrified of oil.

It takes so much funding from the government to start up new facilities and keep them running, not to mention the toxic waste that has to be very carefully disposed of. If we advance Nuclear energy technology I think it's worth maintaining and improving the facilities already running, but any money the government spends on starting up new facilities should be invested in a more diverse range of energy sources. Renewable energy sources have proven to be incredibly effective for Germany, moving forward energy sources like Wind/Solar are going to be much more cost effective than Nuclear energy, and similarly effective, if used properly.

I did not overlook the diet of the animals, I stated explicitly that while some modern methods may not be as good, generally animals would augment the food supply. You ignore that I mentioned other animals. You ignore that you are comparing the entire world to the US...the rest of the world also had large herbivores. The "fed corn" thing is partly true but also effectively a lie. Corn ethanol subsidies in the US produce a ridiculous amount of "mash", high protein remnants of the fermentation process and much of the weight of "corn" comes from this source...effectively reclaiming losses from a previous, ill informed environmental/energy choice. As for the "heat" from the methane, this is laughable. The heat produced by the loss of methane is identical to the heat lost if it is processed through any other method. Conversion of energy to heat is pretty much 100%, you should know this. I understand your position coming from years of hearing an endless stream of what are effectively lies from an unchecked environmental movement....but you are clearly operating with a complete lack of context. You must actually look at "both" sides, then assume they both might be wrong and look a bit more.

So what we do which is already a practice in some countries is that we pick up all the trash and use it as fuel for the turbines that create electricity we clean up after ourselves and the amount of contamination is just 1% this is not the best way but it's a way to also clean up the planet and giving the electric plants some extra use for a few more years	UCviFU0VK3HAI04iMy0r0dSw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCviFU0VK3HAI04iMy0r0dSw	1	Ugg896CKKgMt1XgCoAEC	Archer Adolf

Compare that to the 1.5 billion cows that are alive right now. That means, at their peak, the amount of bison was only about 2% of what the population of cows are now. The thing you overlooked were the diets of the animals. Cows are mainly corn fed now, which isn't part of their natural diet... Making them gassy. They fart more and more methane comes out. And yes methane does disappear quickly in the atmosphere, but the chemical reaction that makes it disappear has a byproduct of heat... And lots of it.

Ugg896CKKgMt1XgCoAEC.8Mno1-k9Knd8MqL97p1nQg		2	2016-12-23 20:03:53	poitsplace	@***** Actually cows are a bit of a non-issue. Almost everything you hear about the environment is just plain wrong because there's no proper context. For instance, it is estimated that there were as many (and possibly more) american bison than there are cows in the US today. There were similar, large herbivores on other continents...and this says nothing about all of the wild pigs, deer, etc. So "there are too many cows" is actually probably a load of crap. The other thing is that the "problem" of cows is one of methane. Methane is destroyed in the atmosphere quite quickly. This is why it's presence is suggested as a way to detect potential life...it must be constantly replenished because it only has a half-life of about 12 years. So basically to double methane levels we'd have to double emissions for as long as that doubling was to be maintained. Its really sad that so much of environmental "science" is such utter garbage yet it slips past even the more educated among the general population. Oh, and I'll throw in a final note about animals in general...while certain modern practices may be wasteful, in general it is actually quite wise to use animals for food as they truly do increase the food supply if done properly. Can you eat corn stalks? How about grass from land unsuitable for farming? Well many animals can...and they can turn these inedible substances into yummy. nutritious meat.

And I'm guessing that even though fusion is jokingly referred to as an energy source that's ALWAYS 30 years away...we'll have it figured out long before the fissile material runs out. Of course, while nuclear is far better suited than wind/solar, it's still not perfect. For a short term solution in meeting peak demand, any sane person that thought climate change was "the greatest threat man has ever faced" would be BEGGING for fracking so we could immediately slash our CO2 emissions by using gas and to make peaking plants to buffer out the nuclear.

They just need to make the gain higher than the loss then clean energy until we use up all the hydrogen at which point we probably would be dead.

The practical side of large scale reactors is still largely unknown, which might bring up issues we hadn't considered before. Any large scale reactor will be a test plant, meaning we are decades of from them being of practical use. It's radioactive waste does not require as long to decay as with a regular Uranium reactor due to using up more of the fuel, but the waste it self is more radioactive and thus more dangerous. And it still takes 300 years for it to no longer be considered dangerous. Also building Uranium reactors in that time will likely cause a huge drain on our supply of available Uranium. I remember reading that we have 50-70 years worth of it at a steady rate of growth (after which there won't be enough Uranium to supply all the reactors). With a massive switch to nuclear power plants that number would likely decrease. Also waste is a massive issue. Most people don't want to nuclear waste storage anywhere near to them. The waste has to be hard to access and guarded to prevent it's misuse. Past experience has shown that the stored waste can leak into the environment and water and thus it would require the places and containers it is stored in to be regularly maintained. Waste therefor is a large drain on resources and cause for concern for millennia to come. Also for both reactors you'd need years before the reactor is online. Besides construction and testing likely already taking several years there's a long planning stage. All in all, nuclear power isn't the be all end all solution for both short and long term people make it out to be.

We can improve on the design and safety regulations if we have a deeper understanding in nuclear fission. Just because something is "nuclear" does not mean it is bad. While the downside to nuclear energy now is "how to dispose the waste", overall the waste produced by a nuclear plant is nothing compared to the greenhouse gases produced by burning fossil fuel. B. The plot in Fallout is that a nuclear war broke out. You know, when countries ACTIVELY THREW NUKES AROUND, blowing everything up. That is completely different from what a nuclear reactor is designed for. The nuclear fission reaction in a nuke is not meant to be controlled. Whereas the one happening in our reactors right now are controlled.	UCHIK0vyJSwSmwo6YHY6HGEw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHIK0vyJSwSmwo6YHY6HGEw	1	Ugg896CKKgMt1XgCoAEC	Archer Adolf

Fuel is cheap and it produces less waste than traditional fossil fuels, but it also has extremely high capital costs, and slow leaks have been a large problem as plants age (aka Indian Point Plant NY). There is also a bad public perception, for whatever reason, but that means it is suffocatingly regulated. However, the liquid fluoride thorium reactor is incapable of melting down, requires much smaller cooling towers (thereby decreasing those capital costs), and the fuel can be easily sourced from the U.S. for all you americans out there. In addition, nuclear waste products from the LFTR have a half life of, at most, 30 years, making it more environmentally friendly as well. People need to be open to the possibilities nuclear presents outside of traditional uranium plants.

The design is promising, but needs more development and research. However, our current uranium reactors (molten salt and pressurized water - which is the most common), are both incredibly safe and should be implemented to reduce the amount of CO2 we pump into our atmosphere.

A meltdown is still possible for a pressurized water reactor, but extremely (and i do mean EXTREMELY) unlikely with trained operators and modern design. Molten salt reactors actually have a zero chance of meltdown, but most in operation today are the pressurized water reactors. On the other hand. Fusion power is really cool, and we are currently researching it (look up the reactor they are building in France!). However, harvesting the energy from this kind of reactor might prove a lot more difficult.

Yeah nuclear energy is our best option with what we have available. and the few reactors that have ever gone down was do to then cutting corners and not building them properly. japan's reactors are a great example of this. here in the us the plants we do have regardless of location are all built to withstand almost any natural disaster with out having a meltdown and burning radioactive death pits into the earth's core. yet Japan being right there where earthquakes are a fairly common thing compared to where some of our reactors are at and they still didn't build them to the same specs we do. they cut corners and it cost them a lot more in the end. as far as nuclear waste there are plenty of ways to properly dispose of it. but will the corporations bother trying any of it? nope cause safe costs money. and they'd rather kill us then make a reliable safe source of energy.

The people that think fission nuclear power plants have no drawbacks need to be reminded that we still have no idea what to do with the waste we already have and that is dangerous for hundreds of years AND there is always the thread of something happening with a power plant (just think of a terror attack on a nuclear power plant ...) with consequences that could mean death or uninhability of gigantic areas (imagine if the projection in Fukushima came true that included Tokyo, the most dense human hub in the world, in the uninhabitably area).

And for all the people who are worried about it because it has the word "nuclear" in the name, let me explain: Nuclear fission reactors are basically making tiny stars by super heating gases into plasma. The miniature star then gives off energy that can be harvested. And the best part? There is absolutely no possible way it can explode. If a reactor meltdown were to occur the plasma would cool down and become hot gas in seconds because it wouldn't be able to sustain itself. It's perfectly safe, now all we need to do is make it possible.	UCedZlt4HXogROHPf2xmd6Sw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCedZlt4HXogROHPf2xmd6Sw	1	Ugg896CKKgMt1XgCoAEC	Archer Adolf

Cities, mines and industrial centers destroyed; millions die due to lack of infrastructure. 3. Collapse of society and thus civil war; millions die. 4. Many years of nuclear winter; billions die of famine. 5. Birth defects and degenerative effects on human health due to radiation poisoning. Climate change: 1. Billions of dollars of yearly damage due to shifting climate zones, droughts, floods and storms. 2. War and massive human migration as a result of this. Without hesitation I would pick climate change if I had the choice. Unfortunately we might get both.

The only reason nuclear power is such a boogeyman is because so many people have bought into the propaganda made by fossil fuel companies. The argument against Thorium is you still need a tiny amount of plutonium which is nuclear waste still, WHICH IS UNACCEPTABLE! So, its better to pollute hundreds of millions of gallons of water, fill the air with toxins, and loose tens of thousands of lives a year. Due to gas explosions, cave ins, and the resulting conflicts for fossil fuels.

I totally missed it.) The radiation only leaks if the reactor is damaged and the safety shut down system fails (like what happened in Fukushima) and the radiation spreads through a circular area which the radius is about 90 kilometers but normally the Nuclear power plant is quite clean and only generates a very small amount of waste. You just have to make sure that it&#39;s not built on top of a water table (like Chernobyl) and also it would be good to make a thin path to the depths of the crust (near the mantle where the molten core would fall just in case if the reactor melts. Right now the current nuclear power plants have an older design and are not very safe.

We had 3 for the past 10 years, one of which also reached Japan and damaged a few Nuclear Power Plants there enough to leak radioactive water into the sea. The shifting of weather patterns and also the uncommon hail storm in an island nation in south-east Asia on a mountainous region during summer. Not to mention the sweltering heat increase even during our rainy season. Nor the fact that for some in the rest of the world with 4 seasons, snow that usually come during November to February now comes in the middle of December through March and sometimes lasts until April. Other than human intervention through weather manipulation experiments or accidental through human wastes, what else could affect the weather so?

Though I was vehemently a part of the Greenhouse Gasses cause Global Warming camp a few years before, but now that a lot of predictions were premature, I'm steadily on the fence as i still believe that human waste must have an effect on the climate. Look at all of the super typhoons in the previous years, and also look at the other strange weather phenomena near the equator.

Proof against global warming? Depends on your definition of global warming and what you think causes it. In the last 100 years, the earth has warmed 1.3 degrees F. If that is your definition of global warming, then I agree. If you think the Earth has warmed more then that, then I don't agree. If you think that global warming is happening because "scientists" and celebrities say so, then I 100% don't agree.

As for the first one, that is meant to show that even NOAA, which has been proven to manipulate their data which is why 300 scientists have signed a petition to have their funding pulled, said that if there was a break of 15 years, then it would prove their models wrong. I didn't give the link to prove my side, I gave it to preface the importance of the rest. As for the warmest years that you got from the link, again, their data is proven to be manipulated, which is why it shows the hottest years.

Your first one, the one that annoyed me a bit cause I had to actually read a lot cause that was actually real data. That was actually the one I enjoyed the most simply because it actually says the opposite of what you are trying to prove. Can't copy the picture from the PDF but in the picture it says: "Fig. 2.2. Year-by-year temperature rankings and 95% confidence limits for the HadCRUT3 temperature analysis. The main panel shows the 50 warmest years and the inset shows the full 159-yr record."

Because most of our firepower are designed for combustion alongside an atmosphere rich in oxygen. Our best bets would be on the Nukes, which do not rely on an atmosphere to explode, but the destruction would be limited due to the vacuum of space, meaning we would need more Nukes to do a job that 3 could do in an atmosphere. And that doesn't even cover the materials the asteroid is made of, so it could also be denser than expected, or it could be irradiated (maybe both?) so initial calculations would be way off. I'm not a nuclear engineer or scientist, so I don't exactly know the various variables involved or how each of them affect the results.

If they really did not just factor in the "small improvements", then NASA and NOAA wouldn't have had to change the data to make it look like the Earth has been warming for the last 20 years when it hasn't, they could have said "the earth isn't warming any more because of the changes we made, keep it up". As for the earth warming up, not for the last 20 years it hasn't, and in the last 100 it has only warmed 1.3 degrees. As for polar ice caps melting, no they aren't, that is a myth. http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamestaylor/2015/05/19/updated-nasa-data-polar-ice-not-receding-after-all/#9591a0b32da1 As for snow and ice masses slowly dwindling, that is also a myth. It comes from the fact that ice sheets having a net GAIN of 100 million tons to a net GAIN of 80 million tons. Global warming people are trying to say it is melting when in actuality, they are still growing, but only at a slightly slower rate. Even NASA says it, although they still needed to qualify it to save face. https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/nasa-study-mass-gains-of-antarctic-ice-sheet-greater-than-losses	UChbwkrwEnpH-M6dh1tUHuDA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UChbwkrwEnpH-M6dh1tUHuDA	1	Ugj-ONu0_V59xHgCoAEC	Caleb Otero

That said, it is true that the earth is warming up, the polar ice-caps are actively melting and large snow and ice masses are slowly dwindling. And climate change is still undergoing through its process as it is the only explanation as to how a country (my country) which only has 2 seasons (rainy and dry) have almost effectively switched their schedules, as the rainy season is pushed back by 2-3 months from our calendar. Our summer used to be April and May, but now they start in July and August.	UC6af1IVUg-fhX1JoF-dwu1w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6af1IVUg-fhX1JoF-dwu1w	1	Ugj-ONu0_V59xHgCoAEC	Caleb Otero

The increased volumes of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are causing a far more dramatic effect than would naturally be experienced, at least without a global cataclysm. Typically marked variations in climatic shift will occur over periods of tens of thousands of years. What's happening at the moment is quite clearly anthropogenic, to deny it is to play the proverbial ostrich because it's uncomfortable.

Science isn't this clean process people believe it is. Scientific consensus tends to shift for a long time until it homes in on a target. I understand that it is difficult for outsiders to make sense of it. It is not always easy for scientists themselves. However, it works. Go back in history. Considering all the missteps and mistakes scientists have made, they have always been magnitudes more precise than anybody else.

Whether people are calling it restorative, regenerative or permaculture they all boil down to a whole suite of techniques that raise the carbon levels stored in the soil. Even something as simple as not spraying poisons (herbicides, insecticides, salt based fertilizers, fungicides, ect) lets natural processes start capturing carbon without any effort on your part. The really cool thing is that soils with high carbon content mitigate a lot of the problems caused by global warming.

Don't think that physics, biology, and mechanical science validates climate science. But even then, those are all known to be wrong many times in the past As for "tell me this what praying to an invisible guy from book ever done for the world." Miracles are well documented, even by secular sources. (This is by a historian late first or second century who was not a christian.) http://www.talmudunmasked.com/chapter5.htm Also, (This is an extremely secular source that even admits it, albeit reservedly.) http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Thallus (This is obviously a christian source but it does give more sources than rationalwiki does.) http://christianthinktank.com/jrthal.html It also matters what you consider a reliable source. If you don't trust someone because they are a Christian and has a bias, then good luck finding an atheist who is going to say God performs miracles.

You have more in common with Bill Nye then you think, neither of you are scientists. And Neil Degryson hasn't even published anything in years and didn't even get the PHD he was studying for at the University of Texas because he was in a band and had to go somewhere else. But he doesn't take responsibility for that, instead he blames racism. So you tell me, is it really too hard for you to type "how does the big bang work" into a search bar then watch a 5 min video? so basically you are saying you don't have all the answers and are not really sure in your beliefs, but you are still confident enough to say you are right, Christians are wrong, and you are willingly to stake the after life on something you don't even know. I don't care how old you are (or claim to be). If you make a claim, you better be prepared to back it up. Otherwise it is better to keep your mouth shut and research it before you say an entire group of people is wrong.

Seeing as the Bible says we are created in His image, it is very possible that He took his time in creating us because He enjoyed it. Similar to a chef or an artist who enjoys going slow. They could easily do something in half the time, but that ruins the experience, perhaps God is the same way. And it is possible He used the 7th day to consider His work further. But again, I am not God, so i don't have any definitive answer. 2) he didn't lie. If Eve hadn't eaten the fruit, she and Adam would have lived forever in the Garden of Eden. But since she ate the fruit, their lives became finite. 4) Yes up until your final line where you say his actions have no consequences. His actions do have consequences, they affect the children his is torturing. If God stepped in and stopped the man from torturing the children, would the man really have free will? And if God took away his free will, can God really be a just God? As for the baby metaphor, I can see it in my lifetime, I can the effects of aging with my own eyes. I experience aging myself. I can see cells divide, replicate, heal, and age in real time using microscopes. So your baby metaphor is completely irrelevant. As for evolution, did the animal change species, yes or no? And again, what is your response to the list of things I asked what your response was? In your next post, have a response to them.

Ugi8fC1Lprmeu3gCoAEC.8MnlaUQf5498Mu3W6mf8El		0	2016-12-25 06:46:42	joe weisenberger	@Paddy Lawn 1) I am not God, so I don't know his reasoning. 2) How did God lie to Adam and Eve? As for you little scenario, I would listen to the man that created me, the room, and everything in the room. I would believe him over some stranger who told me something that contradicted what the creator told me. 4) because it is still free will. Again, if he cleaned up the messes of the cruel people, then what reason do you have not to be cruel? If no matter what you do, it doesn't matter and will be fixed, why not do whatever feels right? If God interfered, then it really would be an illusion of free will. As for the baby metaphor, I can see it happening. As for God being illogical to consider, how so? Is it illogical to consider the possibility that someone created the device you are using to write your posts? Seems pretty logical to me. As for transition, you didn't show anything. A cat with white fur suddenly getting black fur is still a cat, which means it is the same species, which means it is not evolution (specifically Darwinian evolution.)

That means at one point a a whale became a squirrel. There is no transition fossils and no one has ever seen one species becoming another. "I admit we can't detect what happened before the big bang but it seems illogical that god clicked his fingers and everything appeared." So it is more logical to assume that long list of random events i listed, happened? Not by a long shot. If I see a watch, I am not going to assume it made itself. "As for the big bang all the stuff in the universe somehow was compressed into a small point then it exploded and was sent all over the universe eventually due to gravity some elements formed balls of rock" 1) according to the theory, the big bang created all things, so where did the initial mass come from? 2) there is no physical way for that much mass to compress in such a tight area, unless you are saying that mass suddenly was created from nothing. "just luck out of trillions of tries than we landed in the perfect orbit." Really? That sounds logical to you? It just so happened that not only did it magically go into perfect orbit without hitting anything, it also went into a perfect orbit that was the only scenario where life would be possible on Earth? "Also life probably arrived here on an asteroid in the form of bacteria". That makes no sense. Where did the bacteria come from? How did it magically survive space, where there is literally nothing to keep it alive? How did it survive landing on earth? How did it magically survive the lava and extreme cold? " It doesn't replicate perfectly and those times it doesn't multiply perfectly its called a mutation if the mutation is useful it will gain an edge and multiply more" If it doesn't replicate perfectly, then it dies. Unless you are saying that the fist millions and millions of times, it didn't replicate properly, but still managed to survive somehow, in which case that is completely unrealistic.

Ugi8fC1Lprmeu3gCoAEC.8MnlaUQf5498Mu-LivnxP8		0	2016-12-25 06:10:20	joe weisenberger	@Paddy Lawn what is not to get in regards to the anti-science paragraph. The theory would never get replaced by God because of what is already happening. Any scientist who says they believe in God or simply don't believe in the big bang, evolution, or global warming is immediately discredited and ridiculed. As for the second paragraph, we don't know the origin, how long ago, or if it even happened, and we can't see light from the big bang, so it is completely irrelevant. As for the watch, If I saw a Lamborghini in perfect condition in a junk yard full of cars that don't run and are incomplete and rusted out, I would never think that the Lamborghini put itself together. If I see a beautiful tree house in a forest, I am not going to think the tree house is natural. What kind of an argument is that? "what are you comparing the watch to in order to make that judgment?" I am comparing it to logic. Logic says that nature cannot make a watch. Huffingtonpost. I needed a good laugh. Evolution is the theory that one species can become another. That all life once shared a common ancestor and evolved. I am assuming you can't see my 68 line post starting with "According to "science", all life evolved from a common ancestor. ", so I will split it up and re-post it.	UChbwkrwEnpH-M6dh1tUHuDA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UChbwkrwEnpH-M6dh1tUHuDA	1	Ugi8fC1Lprmeu3gCoAEC	Paddy Lawn

A baby growing old is still a human, it is called aging, not evolution. I can't give you an example of something that never happened. It is like how people hailed Lucy as the missing link between monkey and human, until it came out that she is incomplete, put together because parts looked 'similar", and pieces were found hundreds of feet away and below other pieces. Even if I did give an example, it doesn't add to the discussion in any way. If I were to give Trilobites as an example, it wouldn't matter. They claimed it was the missing link between marine and land animals, until it was later proven to have no previous ancestor. Again, is there a reason why you are ignoring my other posts?

But if they actually are not real scientists, but go along with the current theory, then people say you are a real expert and a scientist, like Bill Nye the Not Really a Scientists Guy. "have most of the evidence we possibly detect". Really? How do you think we detected something that supposedly billions of years ago? It is impossible. Science cannot know what happened billions of years ago. Here is a simple example: A swimming race illustrates the simple principles involved in measuring time. This swimmer is competing in a 1,500 metre race and we have an accurate, calibrated wristwatch. We note that at the instant the swimmer touches the edge of the pool our wristwatch reads 7:41 and 53 seconds. How long has the competitor taken to swim the 1,500 meter race? As for your metaphor about the watch, try it this way. A man finds a watch in the middle of nowhere. It works perfectly and looks absolutely stunning. After carefully examining the parts to the watch, the man concludes that the watch created itself out of nothing, instead of thinking that someone actually took care to make the watch. As for your mosquito story, that is not evolution, that is adaptation. The mosquitoes are still mosquitoes, they are simply a sub-species. There also is not enough research done into it. http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20160323-the-unique-mosquito-that-lives-in-the-london-underground	UChbwkrwEnpH-M6dh1tUHuDA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UChbwkrwEnpH-M6dh1tUHuDA	1	Ugi8fC1Lprmeu3gCoAEC	Paddy Lawn

So then why are you so confident in what science says? You said yourself they change theories all the time, what makes you think they are right now? "Christians yet no matter how much evidence is thrown at them still believe there is an all powerful kind invisible man in the sky responsible for everything." 1) like what evidence? How do we know science won't replace it with something else? 2) as for believing something they can't see no matter how much evidence is thrown at them, have you have seen evolution happen? Has anyone every observed evolution? Have you ever seen something come from nothing? Have you ever scattered a bag of marbles and had them organize themselves on their own? No? Then you have faith that you are right. So how is that different than having faith in God? 3) As opposed to think something came from nothing, that nothing then exploded and created something, that something then continued to magically replicate itself, that something then formed countless planets and stars, those planets and stars then perfectly arranged themselves so as to be in perfect orbit, that orbit was in such a way that it was perfect for life on Earth, Earth magically formed the perfect distance from the sun, life then magically appeared on earth out of nowhere, survived for millions of years in extreme cold and heat, that cell of life then magically replicated itself perfectly so that the duplicate could also replicate, this process occurred perfectly, 100% without fail countless times, formed countless of completely different lifeforms, those life forms magically formed at the exact same time so they could reproduce, they then magically evolved on their own to be perfectly fit for their environment, until humans suddenly came to be, at which point evolution completely stopped. That is more credible then believing an all powerful God created all life? How so?	UChbwkrwEnpH-M6dh1tUHuDA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UChbwkrwEnpH-M6dh1tUHuDA	1	Ugi8fC1Lprmeu3gCoAEC	Paddy Lawn

Also what you are saying is ignorant, because while some believed the sun revolved around the earth yet did not have the tools and capabilities and research materials that we now have today which have been used to document climate change since the boom of the industrial revolution.

Additionally CO2 is one of the many gases we release in the air. Climate change is occurring, but what confuses me is you state that man is not to blame..... then who is? Also about the scientists... I think you should check again. If you're going to say this whole video is wrong, at least do some research and offer a counter argument. Cheers. "There is an overwhelming consensus amongst climate scientists that humans are affecting the climate. In April this year the National Academy of Scientists published a paper based on a study of the work and opinions of 1,372 climate scientists. It found that between 97% and 98% of climate scientists accepted the notion of manmade global warming and that those who didn’t were substantially less qualified and less experienced than those who did… “97–98% of the climate researchers most actively publishing in the field support the tenets of anthropogenic (manmade) climate change outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and the relative climate expertise and scientific prominence of the researchers unconvinced of anthropogenic climate change are substantially below that of the convinced researchers” http://www.pnas.org/content/107/27/12107.full.pdf http://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/	UCwVu_Wiz20sgCGpkiLsa-7A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwVu_Wiz20sgCGpkiLsa-7A	1	Ugi8fC1Lprmeu3gCoAEC	Paddy Lawn

The only downside to it though is that it would smell bad every time you had to get gas ( now that I think about it, what would we call it). Your idea of getting rid of ethanol won't happen, sadly. thick minded vegans will say it's better for the environment because it's made of plants. if you don't think that will happen I heard someone call Hawaii a continent.

The drastic increase in temperatures during the past 100 years is unlike anything else in the human era, and the fact that the greenhouse effect due to carbon emissions is real, all fingers point to humans. While a small part of this might be natural, a drastic change such as this temperature rise is impossible to occur naturally in such a short amount of time, so it is sadly our fault, and denying this truth will only hurt the future generations.

Earlier he talked about topics that even republicans could agree with. For example, the video about diamonds. Even republicans will tell you climate change happens, the difference is where republicans see the cause. Republicans are willing to consider the sun, planetary orbits, and nature as possible causes, democrats are not. Republicans see climate change as an ongoing thing.

I want us to be able to live without fossil fuels. Unfortunately I'm not a scientist and have no idea what to do. One thing we can try but there isn't enough supply, is running cars off natural gas. You can get natural gas from digested cow manure. In doing so we would reduce methane pollution from dairies by 90%+ and have clean renewable energy that burns clean. Other than that I have no idea what to replace fossil fuels with.... ethanol is a horrible idea and it requires fossil fuels to produce anyways. It also burns large portions of food resources 70% of all corn to be exact, it also destroys and corrodes motors. If you have a better idea please by all means do something about it.

Even though we can use alternative energy sources yet they still don't want to because they will have to pay a tinier bit more money. Also you complain about whiny Democrats while you yourself are using Ad Hominem in an arguement to prove a futile point.

Republicans are the true snowflakes. snowflakes are cold and don't have much of a point just like them. I agree theyll get triggered 5x lol. They think they can just sit and mock people who use facts with no retalliation?? riiiiiight. NO. Republicans are going to fade out due to the majority being old and stubborn. Facts will conquer myths again one day. Global warming is in fact a thing and instead of these dumbass republicans saying no I'll just throw trash where They feel like it cause they cant spend 2 minutes to properly dispose or leaving everything as it is and going backwards is a ok we will have real logic. things aren't ok. stop being lazy and change things!!

As new things are discovered with new technology, sometimes they have to be changed. That doesn't mean it should stop being researched. Environmental changes are incredibly slow though, so you're technically free to assume it's a hoax since it probably won't affect you.

Why? Because the US already does this, yet China (aka the current source of a massive majority of the world's CO2 emissions to the point where literal cities of smog exist and there are several dead zones of toxic runoff fumes) doesn't. This means that the ONLY way to make any noticeable positive effect on Global Warming is if China makes any limitations on fuel burning...which, let's face it, they'll never do. In other words, the only way to fight climate change is if the entire world simultaneously, magically got along and adopted fuel burning limitations, but that's the stupidest, unrealistically impossible thing ever that's so unbelievable that fairies have a higher chance of existence than this.

Liberals for 10yrs have been doing green campaigns in America wholeheartedly but the overall effect according to them is not a lot. These green campaigns have at best slowed us down minutely as every week we hear how we aren't doing enough. On the other hand the energy field is in crisis as America struggles to support itself as jobs are cut and overall power goes down. This doesn't force America to use less but instead let's foreign companies in. If this continued, in ten years America would have been critical for power and jobs with the economy quickly plummeting. To this end it's clear that America couldn't support themselves keeping this up. So with these programs cut more money can go into finding greener sources and America will then have the resources to follow through with it. Trump will never accomplish this. But he doesn't need to. i find Donald Trump is a giant orange reset button that will undo a lot of faults that the liberals have made then when he isn't president we can to forward with a stronger base at our feet.

Because fuel is what provides our government with money. We have WARS to protect oil fields. So no, your assumption is incorrect and unfounded. The government isn't screaming global warming, only the scientists are. They're unanimously on the side of climate change. You act like every single scientist to ever live is somehow funded by the government. LMAO! Besides, the whole point of climate change is to make more efficient and less damaging energy sources, to recycle trash and use the trash again. How in the hell could that hurt anyone. lmao. You're thinking so narrowly. "Solar and wind energy are all hoaxes, geothermal energy doesn't exist. It's a plot to make more money. It gets warm during summer and cold in Winter so climate change must be a hoax!" lmfao dude read a book.

First it was Global Cooling, then Global warming, then Climate change. Each time they had to change the name of it because data didnt support the claims. Earths been warming and cooling since it was created. Their is however big money for scientists if they support the governments claim on Global warming.

We've turned it into an "us vs them" issue. Like I said in a previous comment. I don't disagree that the planet is warming up.

Many "experts" of human past were sure the world was flat. Furthermore one doesn't have to be an expert to note discrepancies or flaws. And no I am not saying humans don't affect their planet and I never said or implied they didn't. The "doctor" I referenced is but one of many scientists. You do realize that the title of Doctor also refers to a doctorate degree? He is a scientist from the University of Alabama. I don't know how you get to the conclusion of "destiny" and how that proves I'm religious. But even if I was it should have no bearing on the matter.

UggyTgYpr1L3oXgCoAEC.8Mnl-8lrcmC8Us_N8ubYQX		0	2017-07-11 13:06:31	Chu Chulainn	vasilia s I could give you a long winded biography but I will tell you my views and leave it at that. Everybody thinks you have to pick a side in this issue. It's a us vs them mentality. Which is why it's hard to have a civil conversation about this. I will start by saying that I am by no means an expert in this matter. I couldn't tell you the most recent data statistics or the most recent research on sea levels. Even during my "save the planet" days I didn't actually study my belief. Not my proudest statement. However, I have recently (in the last 5 years) started to study this subject in more depth and have taken a moderate viewpoint. In the scientific community, a single conflicting  experiment or observation invalidates any theory, law, or hypothesis. Proper theories and hypotheses must be falisfiable. That basically means we have to be able to make observations and experiments to make the hypothesis or theory false. Science is most of the time skepticism. We check the numbers and we try to find flaws. "Climate change" is not falsifiable. "Man-made global warming", however, is a hypothesis. It is falsifiable. Hypotheses are constantly changing as more data causes it to change. The computer models used to predict climate change have been unsuccesful. If you want an example look up "Dr. John Christy's computer model". The predictions did not match the actual observations. Any model we produce HAS to establish some kind of track record BEFORE it is used in calculations and certainly before making policy. THAT'S where the dishonesty is. We are dealing with insufficient or incomplete data yet we have scientists saying it's fact when it clearly isn't. The debate isn't global warming nor whether man affects it. The debate is about HOW MUCH man affects it and whether or not it is as dangerous as many have been led to believe. MY conclusion... is that catastrophic climate change as a result of the actions of man is inconclusive. Natural climate change is not fully understood. So I am "on the fence" on this issue. I am and always be open for debate. I believe we can figure out what's going on but not with the current atmosphere (pun intended) of debate. The purpose of debate is not TO WIN. The purpose of debate is TO LEARN. By gaining knowledge we gain perspective, with perspective we gain wisdom, and with all three we can find solutions to whatever challenges comes our way.

I thought that our planet was in great peril and the sky was falling and if we didn't do something right now we were all going to die. And everyone who said otherwise were fools. But as I kept seeing prediction after prediction and none actually happening it led me to question the science behind the claims. I finally allowed myself to hear other arguments that were contrary to mine and did some fact checking myself. What I have found has been eye opening to say the least. I would like to discuss all this with you but I don't wish to argue the point any further and it probably wouldn't do any good. I'll only say that my own research have caused me to seriously alter my views on this matter. Like I stated, I don't disagree that our planet is changing. I do agree we need to manage pollution and our planets natural beauty. But mankind still doesn't understand the particulars of climate and I question how much influence we have whether negatively or positively. I definitely question our ability to accurately predict climate change. We certainly have no control over it but that goes without saying.

I never stated that you denied climate change, i stated that you're refusal to commit to self reflection shows the true morally as well as intellectually irresponsibility that you accuse others on. 3.) You're claim that stated that scientists has not predicted climatic changes and that those predictions did not come true? Ok so? Temperatures didn't rise? levels and severity of storms didn't rise? the exasperation of natural disasters such as floods, droughts, tornadoes, etc. It wasn't that the models didn't predict or was wrong to predict, it couldn't predict the specifics of when natural disasters or climatic changes would occur, that's not what models do, Models dictate the levels and the severity of the climatic changes, not "at this time, this natural disaster would occur at this place" Its "These types of natural disasters would become more severe, This stems from either your misunderstanding on the nature of scientific models to begin with, Or your willful ignorance on what those models are suppose to represent, either way, your type of thinking in this regard is deeply "irresponsible" 4.) Man Made Climate change, ooh i'm sorry that wasn't actually what the purpose of what scientists have claimed, the contention wasn't that man created climate change, the contention was that man exasperated climate change, your continuing to use this type of information despite being corrected on multiple occasion on the actual contention of the scientific community showcase further irresponsibility on your part. Next, the contention of these scientists on that man exasperated the situation of climate change isn't due to just "observations" but due to actual real world data, despite the fact that the world has become slightly and slight warmer over its history, when we started collecting data, we found levels of CO2 or greenhouse gasses to explode during the same era of industrialization These contentions are based upon collected data that showcase these types of explosive greenhouse gases emissions, the temperature of the planet also accelerated at rates that the world's environment simply can't handle that well. So its not that there isn't actual solid proof to support the scientific community, the real problem is that YOU'RE REFUSAL to admit to such, leaves you blind and idiotic. yet again, You're the true example of morally and intellectually irresponsible There is simply too many evidence to state the support of the scientific community rather than your own flawed logic and when you actually ignore the experts on the matter, that has been studying, collecting data, and looking at the history of our species, simply for your own flawed stupidity? This no longers becomes a question on who's right or wrong, this becomes a question on how wrong are you...and based upon you're previous comment... YOU'RE PRETTY DAMN WRONG.

If you had actually read my previous comments, I do actually agree with scientists that the world is warming up. Our climate IS changing. That is a FACT. My dissent comes from the fact that scientists have been using models to predict climactic change and these predictions have NOT come true. The issue is not whether climate change is happening. The issue is whether or not man is the cause and if so to what extent? Man-made climate change is more than an idea, it is based on some observations and reasonable models of the process have been developed and can be tested. But, none of the models have successfully predicted any climatic events, at least not the catastrophic, apocalyptic results they have predicted. Thus, they are still a work-in-progress and not admissible as evidence supporting a scientific theory much less to directly influence government policy. That's where the dishonesty starts. Instead of following their own scientific process, they keep drumming the same tune despite evidence that, at the very least should cause some pause. I don't claim to be an expert. But I would like to see the actual proof that man is SOLELY responsible. So far I have not seen it.

I don't deny our climate is changing but I have 2 reasons why I don't believe man is the cause. I have no doubt we affect it. But blaming it on us to the extreme that many have is intellectually and morally irresponsible. My first reason is this. Though I don't dispute a changing climate, the idea of man made climate change cannot be accepted because NONE of the models supporting this claim have been able to predict ANY climactic events. Therefore, it is NOT ADMISSABLE as evidence for a scientific theory much less proof. Second, the earth is 78% Nitrogen, 21% Oxygen, and 1% other gases with CO2 making up a measly 0.04%. Is carbon truly the cause? Or is it something else? Is it possible that we, in our fervor, have overlooked something? Just something to think about.

UggyTgYpr1L3oXgCoAEC.8Mnl-8lrcmC8TjgFI_S8vC		4	2017-06-13 05:42:03	Megan	Anna Mozatee : From my observation you are stating that global warming has nothing to do with our current use of fossil fuels. According to Nasa on Climate change, the carbon dioxide levels have not been over 300 parts per million for at least 400,000 years; todays' levels are 400. Many of the ice ages you have talked about were indeed small changes in temperature, although you denied that they were in fact not. As NASA explains "Most of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth’s orbit that change the amount of solar energy our planet receives." You state that global warming is not due to the human population but informed and better educated researchers at NASA can beg to differ. Nasa states "The current warming trend is of particular significance because most of it is extremely likely (greater than 95 percent probability) to be the result of human activity." You can search that quote to check me :). You can not argue the fact that humans burn coal, oil and gas (fossil fuels) to generate electricity or drive our cars. When this occurs carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere, where it traps heat, which therefore majorly contributes to global warming. If you are still confused feel free to make a counter-claim. Please make sure to site your evidence this time :).

UggyTgYpr1L3oXgCoAEC.8Mnl-8lrcmC8REzwv_ie_e		11	2017-04-12 05:15:41	shadowywarrior	ahh so let me answer that, as you say, the earth has gone through multiple ice ages and thus has gone through periods of warming and cooling throughout its natural history, however; our method of warning is far above the norm, far above anything the earth has ever experienced throughout its 4.4 billion year life. Not to mention the fact that we're actually suppose to be going through a period of cooling, as shown by our sun cycle, which is in its 24th or was it its 12th cycle? where its activity is actually less than previous cycles. So the issue isn't if Global warming is man made or not, the issue is how man has exacerbated the process. and the evidence is quite damning. That since the industrial revolution, the earth has gone through an exponential level of warming with very little to actually lower. Continue on this path, and we damn our future, not just for us, but for our children, our children's children, and our children's children's children. We would condemn the entire human race to destruction if we do not fix the problem now. We no longer have the luxury of kicking it down the road.

Ugj4XJ9pc4zxS3gCoAEC.8Mnkmc_bZLu8Mo8_5h3XQ1		0	2016-12-22 23:35:30	Alex	Water is denser than ice. The density of water is 1000 kg/m^3. The density of ice is 917 kg/m^3. When ice turns into water, it takes up less space as it did when it was ice because the same amount of material is now in a denser form. If you are a little confused still, fill a glass with ice cubes and then fill it to the top with water. When the ice melts, the water will not be at the top of the glass. Have a nice day.
