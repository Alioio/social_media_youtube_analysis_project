The earth is warming, true enough, but at a rate so slow, it will be generations before any detrimental effects are felt and advances in technology are on our side. 99% of¬†warming is part of the planet&#39;s natural cycle, while about 1% is caused by human activity. Although the US is a major contributor, it is also #1 in pollution reduction world wide. Unlike undeveloped nations, the US has strict penalties for¬†discharging polluting emissions, clear cutting, and improper waste disposal, which are the Big Three¬†of the 1% human contribution. The goal is to educate by book, carrot, and stick, that portion of the world which, necessarily, looks to their next day, rather than their next century. So, relax...we can only do what we can only do. We still have¬†time.¬†¬†¬†ùï≥ùñäùñÜùñóùñôùñç	UCBUqOoA9fby8MmUmt9C2n5A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBUqOoA9fby8MmUmt9C2n5A	0

There were no airplanes and cars to cause the climate change back then which saw this turn into a desert. In Siberia the Woolly Mammoth, Saber Tooth Tiger and many species died out due to climate change 10,000 years ago. Underwater ruins have been found off the coast of both the Bahamas and Japan which were dated to 10,000 years ago. Nobody was &quot;causing&quot; climate change then.

Obviously, the climate is changing across the world but according to a study conducted by the Weather Channel and several other organizations. Human co2 emissions don&#39;t correlate with the changing climate. It&#39;s hard to accomplish but deeper research must be undertaken before we make any drastic political, social, or economic changes.

Animals used to be much bigger than when man came to the picture. these animals consumed larger amounts of resources and expelled greater amounts of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, methane and others. geologically speaking the earth is not as active as it was before where volcanoes spewed even larger amounts of those same gases. a hundred years ago is but a fraction of the time that the earth has been around. drilling samples show the levels of these greenhouse gases going up and down for millions of years. unfortunately these facts do not support the "Climate Change" narrative and are excluded from most academic reports which pick and choose which findings it wants to use to support their narrative. I find it a little sceptical and hard to believe researchers who have a financial stake on proving their version of the "Truth" to be right.

Ugiew2hdFwCO0XgCoAEC	0	0	2016-04-12 21:29:13	Phelony Jones	Former United Nations climate official Ottmar Edenhofer: &quot;One has to free oneself from the illusion that international climate policy is environmental policy. This has almost nothing to do with the environmental policy anymore, with problems such as deforestation or the ozone hole, &quot;said Edenhofer, who co-chaired the UN&#39;s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change working group on Mitigation of Climate Change from 2008 to 2015. So what is the goal of environmental policy? &quot;We redistribute de facto the world&#39;s wealth by climate policy,&quot; said Edenhofer. For those who want to believe that maybe Edenhofer just misspoke and does not really mean that, consider that a little more than five years ago he also said that &quot;the next world climate summit in Cancun is actually an economy summit during which the distribution of the world&#39;s resources will be negotiated. &quot;	UCk4Q8IvLKkqdJ1tbcWo9Ijw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk4Q8IvLKkqdJ1tbcWo9Ijw	0

Of course not.<br /><br />Should we allow cities to be riddled with smog? Of course not.<br /><br />I&#39;m not saying respect for our environment shouldn&#39;t be shown, but think before you hand control of your city&#39;s businesses to your government.<br /><br />Wall street investors fight hard for climate change legislation. why? because they can make money every time a business interest has to comply. <br /><br />My favorite piece of legislation was to control &quot;methane emissions&quot; by controlling how many cattle a farmer is allowed to own...they literally wanted to regulate cow farts.<br /><br />If methane emissions were such a big deal, think about the question I asked you at the top.

I'm not saying that I don't breathe out CO2 which contributes to other life forms around the world. About preserving: I think (and believe) that I'm preserving the Earth. Regardless of which side you take, both sides usually agree that the Earth is gradually warming up. The debate is whether or not humans are contributing to it and if we are accelerating it or not. We can observe that glaciers are melting, sea levels are rising, and other various things through statistical evidence. I want to preserve the balance of nature so that it is not changed majorly to the extent where it affects us on a larger scale and so we don't have to fix an unnoticed leaking faucet. Also, your analogy with tax is slightly off... I understood the message you were trying to convey, but a tax does take away from the original quantity of something, so therefore, it would still have an effect, regardless of its quantitative size.

You are so focused on exactly what you need to be focused on in order to bring in the end days... If you didn&#39;t read the bible, you should, because everything you see or hear before you is perfectly and exactly put in order of things to come. You never read it. Your fear shows. <br />Ask Jesus Christ for full understanding and He promises He will give it to you. Get a King James Bible, ask Jesus is this the truth, ask Him to show you because this world and man are so messed up they can&#39;t see what&#39;s in front of them. <br />When you see yourself being forced into groups to follow something, just because others are following the newest worldly thing. Stop. <br />Ask Jesus if He&#39;s real, ask Him is this King James Bible is real. Then any threat that comes your way will be known truth, and truth is everything you will ever need. Jesus Christ is the only way to find peace, this world will never give you peace, it wants you to take the mark of the beast and shut-up and obey. You may think its a good thing to do, but before you die after you have taken the &quot;MOB&quot; you will begin to die and you will be gone as the person you once were and you will wish you could die but death will not come for 5 months and then you have the lake of fire to look forward to. <br />Whatever time it all begins, it may have already started, but I feel people will line up like they line up for the newest ipad or game console. those in the lineup will be wondering why those idiots won&#39;t take this amazing technology and choose to die, they will be shaking their heads and thinking those ones are crazy. Fact is is if you are part of the &quot;MOB&quot; line up your already finished and mocking the ones who don&#39;t want this new fabulous this. ... Don&#39;t get to this point. remember this post, remember the Gospel. Remember Jesus Christ, no matter what is coming what is being prepared, remember Jesus, He&#39;s the only way truth and the life, no man enters heaven but through Him. Even if you don&#39;t know Him, go read the King James Bible and ask Him while you have it opened is this it, is this the truth.

Don&#39;t succumb to ignorance by denying its existence. If we don&#39;t take action anytime soon, the repercussions will be irreversibly massive, as well as devastating to future generations.

The global warming people are scam artists seeking to rob us of our freedoms and quality of life and to make energy un-affordable for those of us least able to afford it. It would be great if these bright young minds would have a Sherlock Holmes mentality to get to the bottom of the money trail tied to the phoney science and the global warming profiteers lead by Gore and Obama and others which stand to make untold millions if they can just push this hoax down unsophisticated peoples throats. I was so disappointed with Obama in Paris alluding to the fact the climate change is somehow our most important problem we face today. It is only a problem for him because he can&#39;t dumb down people enough to put their hands in their pockets and pay him and Gore. I would actually entertain arguments about climate change if it were not for the money trail that absolutely must be factored in and explored before we can trust the scientists of the political class. The rest just want a religion and why should it not be the religion of global warming..	UCX-piGZTCp7gPUu54Z3oDCw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX-piGZTCp7gPUu54Z3oDCw	0

It is just not caused by CO2. In fact if you get down to the really basic physics and math, the mechanism claimed to be operative is impossible unless you violate the first and second laws of thermodynamics and quantum mechanics. It is all total BS. The so-called greenhouse effect is already saturated, -meaning that the re-radiated photons that can be captured by CO2 are already being fully captured, adding CO2 cannot change anything. Adding water vapour cannot multiply because there is nothing to multiply. The role of water vapor is very complex but the net effect of water vapour is actually to cool, not warm. The only way to change the overall temperature of the planet is to increase or decrease the level of insolation. This has already been proven, no theory here, but this information is being suppressed and hidden from all the believers by the IPCC, the priesthood of the cult.

Developed countries have outsourced most of their carbon emissions to developing countries, to support their unsustainable lifestyles. We need to talk about lifestyles and sustainability. This is the crux of the matter. Rich/developed countries&#39; lifestyles are what is causing this whole mess. They are responsible for consuming nearly all that is produced and consequently nearly all of the carbon emissions.

Last year alone we had record breaking rainfall, winds, snowfall and then three months later the hottest summer EVER recorded in the UK.... In one year a majority of the records for the past 100 were broken... Mankind&#39;s effct on climate change is debatable, Climate change as an issue is not. From what i have seen it is here and its happening.	UCfs5J5MLDoIpmWEK-FGo2Hg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfs5J5MLDoIpmWEK-FGo2Hg	0

Recently though, I noticed something. All my videos are in the &#39;People and Blogs&#39; category, when I want them to be in the &#39;Gaming&#39; category. Despite having searched on both YouTube and Google on how to change it to the &#39;Gaming&#39; category, I did not find anything of help. So if you (or anyone) could nod me in the right direction on how to fix this I would be very grateful, maybe even sign that petition!

But it also does untold damage to our planet: according to the United Nations, raising animals for food is ‚Äúone of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global.‚Äù Raising animals for food is one of the largest sources of carbon-dioxide emissions and the single largest source of both nitrous-oxide and methane emissions, all of which are major contributors to climate change. Producing fertiliser for crops to feed animals, oil to run the trucks that take them to slaughter and electricity to freeze their carcasses requires massive amounts of fossil fuels, which equals massive amounts of carbon dioxide released into our atmosphere. The billions of animals around the world kept on factory farms produce methane during digestion, and the acres of cesspools filled with the animals‚Äô decomposing waste create a staggering 65 per cent of the world‚Äôs nitrous-oxide emissions.

The USA doesn&#39;t even make anything anymore. As a matter of fact, the head of EPA admitted deploying every measure will not have any measurable affect. Furthermore the earths history has shown there was more Co2 than at present. And we can only go back 200-300 years in temp data. Put down the kool aid folks.

Sure warmed up since then, but there were no CO2 omissions to drive that change. Polar ice cap at the south pole is at an all time high and growing so how can people believe that the ice caps are melting? Also, if they are melting, that water has to go someplace and there is no data anyplace in the world that shows rising sea levels. Like I said, global warming does not pass some basic tests of logic.

Just look up the average world temperatures of the last couple of hundreds of years the temperature has stayed relatively stable until around 1920 and then boom temperature goes up by around 1 degree Celsius by today. Then look up co2 levels in the air it starts increasing dramatically around 1900. Look up co2 emissions by humans it starts around 1850 and then around 1950 it starts to skyrocket. Now look up co2 levels over the last thousands of years its pretty steady and then boom around the modern era the line goes straight up the amount of co2 increasing by 50%. Now we also know that co2 is a greenhouse gas which means it traps heat. So we can draw a couple of conclusions from this. The earth has warmed up by about 1 degree Celsius ever since around the early 1900s. Now that may not seem that much but the average temperature during the last ice age was only about 3 degrees Celsius cooler. The co2 levels on earth have increased since the late 1800s and its due to humans. Now of course correlation doesn&#39;t mean causation but still co2 levels have risen, average temperature has risen. co2 is a greenhouse gas. It seems pretty obvious what is happening. Anyway even if we are not causing climate change its better to air on the side of caution.	UC8r7uSzxRZ-SvKwTb1DEkrg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8r7uSzxRZ-SvKwTb1DEkrg	0

The difference between the current warming cycle and the cycle that¬†happened about 100,000 years ago is that the current, unnatural cycle is being caused by unnaturally high levels of CO2 in the air (no thanks to us and our cars, factories, airplanes, etc.), whereas earlier cycles were caused by the natural rotation of the Earth. And don&#39;t even try to pretend that deforestation is a &quot;natural cycle.&quot; We&#39;ve destroyed so much of the natural process that actually removes CO2 from the atmosphere.

Seriously though, i imagine a worried group of primates multiple times throughout history pointing fingers and possibly profiting from the impending doom &quot;humanity&quot; is causing. yet each ice age eventually ends and the earth heats up, over and over again. how many times does mother nature need to wipe these pretentious little primates off the earth before they stop pretending to know more than they know? the earth is warming and so are the other planets.. we know not where we are at any point in any climate- thats kinda the definition of a climate in terms of age.. ill continue to burn my leaves, cook hot dogs and whittle by the fire. little primates be gone.

I&#39;m making an effort to save the planet, why are you charging me for it? And $200 extra because I forgot to take the lid off a plastic bottle once? Are you kidding me? And how about carbon footprint taxes, do you really think that it&#39;s a good idea to tax families for each kid they have because of the extra CO2 they put out? Get off your bloody high horse!<br /><br />Now if these changes are promoted towards affordable energy sources such as solar and wind, I&#39;ll back that happily, but if you&#39;re just going to shut down coal mines and oil companies without replacing them with an equally or cheaper supply of clean energy, don&#39;t bother. You may be &quot;saving the world&quot;, but you are hurting humanity. I wrong cannot fix a wrong. Provide a solution, not another problem.

And if the pres is so worried about climate change then the first thing he should have done was have an electric BEAST built to cart him around. In order to be a true and effective leader is to lead by example. But we have Royalty in the whitehouse or at least that is how they come across by their words and actions. Their way or the highway. Climate change is a &quot;Wag The Dog &quot; tactic this administration uses to cover their bad behavior and scandals. Plain and simple. You want to get a handle on climate change? Start with the really offending countries like China as they do nothing and care even less.	UCNpObOq8Q2-ORMs1v235ANQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNpObOq8Q2-ORMs1v235ANQ	0

I hope Obuma keeps working on it to distract him from doing more damage than he has already. Man-made climate change is nothing more than a political scheme to redistribute wealth globally. Amazing how many people fall for it! But then again it is amazing how ignorant the general public has become.

In reality this is propoganda pushed by multi million dollar organizations like Google who buy scary technology like robot dogs in development for military use. <br />I know not everyone agrees with me and I don&#39;t have all the answers but I do remember learning what a scientific fact is, and until %100 of scientists agree to global warming being real or there is irrefutable proof of this theory it remains a theory. Even if most mainstream scientists agree with global warming, by their logic facts are not up for interpretation, they simply exist or do not exist. And if we blur the lines between fact and fiction we live in a world without truth.	UCuGBcBpS6TdLR1rh_Q-24xg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuGBcBpS6TdLR1rh_Q-24xg	0

Just because there WAS more doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t go away over time and become worse than before; worse than even that time. 2. C02 helps plants grow using the sun&#39;s energy (C02 + H2O + Sun&#39;s Energy = Glucose + Oxygen). With the amount of deforestation and the poisoning of our oxygen via chemicals (pollution), plants are unable to make a sustainable amount of oxygen. Until trees make a comeback on our planet, life will become harder to sustain and eventually WE WILL ALL DIE. 3. We are causing air pollution because we are putting polluting chemicals into the air. People in factories, however, have attempted to stop this by filtering the pollutants coming from the smokestacks. Sadly, not many have the funding to do so. Hope this helps!

Especially when i watched this this morning, there where/are a lot more negative comments on this video than positive ones. Listen people: we live in a democracy, not a theocracy. the majority of people want a change; there will be a change. There simply aren&#39;t enough fundamentalists out there to stop it. Postpone it a few years maybe, until the sea levels start visibly rising, the populations of polar animals have been mortally wounded, but not stop it completely. My call to all people out there with sense: Speak up. Just speak up, and we can actually save the world.	UC8uCL1Vs6s1oBJWk4lQxkTQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8uCL1Vs6s1oBJWk4lQxkTQ	0

Yes, there is a serious problem with our climate and that is this: Artificially manufactured weather that the masses see every single day and somehow very, very few are willing to acknowledge the nightmare of geo-engineering and its effects on the planet and human health.

It is pop culture, socialist dribble that is part of what has passed for education (brainwashing) since political correctness started infecting our culture. It has been debunked repeatedly - firstly by the fact that all the planets in our solar system have seen the same temp fluctuations that we have - despite lacking expensive cars. Which is why y&#39;all changed the label from Global Warming: to just calling it climate change now .... That is a &quot;lookie loo&quot; that you hope will make us forget how wrong y&#39;all were the first time. We haven&#39;t. This is nothing more that the same old &quot;haves vs. the have nots&quot; .... just repackaged as environmental concern so fewer people will argue with you on it for fear of being called meanies who don&#39;t care about the environment but it&#39;s no coincidence that the chicken littles in the global change warming climate (whatever your term this week is) hate all the same things the socialists do.

We need to stop acting as if the Earth is such a delicate creature. We confuse most of our actions with totally natural occurrences. The Earth isn&#39;t getting warmer from us. Sure, people say that some poll they took from 1900 to now is getting warmer, but who&#39;s to say it wasn&#39;t that warm in 1500? Humans can&#39;t document everything, and I&#39;m sick of people only listening to social media, the same source forcing you to accept things you wouldn&#39;t necessarily want to. (Seriously, have you looked up exactly how much CO2 trees and ocean water absorb? It&#39;s crazy!) Now I&#39;m not saying that nothing is happening. Our rapid deforestation in the Amazon is causing animals to be endangered and less CO2 to be absorbed. Our factories are only causing temporary climate change. So tell me, why are you advocating global warming when some parts of the globe are receiving the coldest climates by record earlier and earlier? Oh! That&#39;s right. You broadened the term by saying it&#39;s &quot;climate change&quot; so no matter what happens, you&#39;re correct. These people make me sick. And now Google has jumped on the band wagon. Ah, the Disney of search engines. Google has become just another social media crazed trash heap, like Facebook. Your little UN is doing nothing more than bicker and agree on a promise no one keeps. Believe me, this world is doomed, but it&#39;s not from what we&#39;re doing to the environment, it&#39;s what we&#39;re doing to ourselves. We&#39;re literally becoming fit to be mindless slaves of big business. Society is the most currupt thing today. Why do we hate everything about ourselves? Our race, country, religion, planet? Can&#39;t we just accept things while keeping other&#39;s rights?	UC_JFgLBCszor59XtbslrUEQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_JFgLBCszor59XtbslrUEQ	0

The more of them we put into the atmosphere the hotter the surface becomes. Things like airplanes cause extremely high emissions of these gasses. I&#39;m sorry, but things like animal agriculture and other issues being cited should not be the main concern. The main concern needs to be creating an alternative renewable fuel source and alternative ways of producing electric power.

The amount of fuel and land and water used to maintain the livestock industry is crazy. Oil fracking consumes 100 billion gallons of water world wide... livestock consumes 34 trillion IN THE US ALONE. 70% of antibiotics used in this country go inside of livestock not people. Methane released by livestcok is 86% more potent then Co2 out of a car. i could go on and on ... I mean this with the utmost respect but i encourage you to do some reasearch on the subject , sad part is all these numbers came from a 2006 report and almost 10 years later most people still think transportation is what killing us. 91% of amazon deforestation has been to grow feed for cattle. 70% of grains made in the u.s is to feed cattle not people.... in a country of 300 with people going hungry , that much grain could feed 800 million people, thats our population almost trippled	UCpyumzixHSddBqhc5BC9sCg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpyumzixHSddBqhc5BC9sCg	1	Ugi_9Kl0phCJqngCoAEC	Seth Catalano

Also, water vapor is called a cloud, just so you know. And for clarification, most CO2 in the atmosphere surprisingly comes from deep sea vents and ocean activity, and ironically is then absorbed again by the ocean until re-released as result of externally induced heating (IE solar flares)	UCw0QtmlzqN8HhgIelQ0Ri2w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw0QtmlzqN8HhgIelQ0Ri2w	1	Ugi_9Kl0phCJqngCoAEC	Seth Catalano

Ughd5KbM4AlozngCoAEC	0	0	2015-11-28 23:32:33	Diana February	Ozone has three properties, one solid, one gas and one liquid, depending upon the temperatures it is exposed to. When superheated it becomes a liquid, when supercooled a solid, and at standing temperature a gas. A rocket has a tip that is so cold that ice crystals form on it while it is gathering thrust to exit the earths atmosphere. The tip gets plenty cold so that by the time it hits the layer of ozone it is the perfect temperature needed to change the ozone from its gaseous state to its solid state, which it does upon contact. When a solid rock is up high in earths atmosphere while still in the gravitational pull of the earth, it will fall towards the earth and as it does it burns up because of the speed of the descent. So every time we send a rocket ship up into outer space we disintegrate a small portion of the layer of ozone. We pretty much crack the sky, and it falls to earth in little pieces. Over some time with relentless and unlimited space travel, a bunch of holes happen, this letting in more harmful rays that then become trapped in our atmosphere, that the mix with the carbon mono fluorocarbons, that the give rise to the earths core temperature, this the greenhouse effect.Nothing else, no other human factors, account for such adamant damage. CFCs cannot poke a hole in the atmosphere. They can build up and mix with the newly entered more harmful rays as particulate matter that can the account for increased temperatures that can melt the polar ice caps that can then flood the lands currently dry and habitable. As the ice changes to water and floods the dry lands it might expose, at least at the Antarctic region, land presently covered with permafrost. Which will eventually dry and with the Suns help cause dormant plant species to germinate and sprout. So maybe all won&#39;t be lost and those of us who survive the flood long enough to make it down to the South Pole and who can wait out the growing process can survive to reproduce and repopulate the earth.

This is one of the largest, if not the biggest, scentific consensus on any scientific theory today. The consensus is as good as its going to get. Its idiotic and arrogant to believe that human activity isn&#39;t playing any role when several scientific organizations have agreed that there is human activity contributing to this. <br /><br />Oil companies and the koch brothers are funding climate deniers like those in the republican party to spread false propaganda about the &quot;hoax&quot; of climate change.

UgjdFUfjKUOBIXgCoAEC	0	0	2015-11-28 22:55:43	Monkey Master	Is climate change a problem? Hmm, maybe depends on your perspective. First off, this video and many climate change alarmists always focus on the negative aspects of climate change, but what about the positive? With every change in this world, also comes opportunity. If the World started to warm up and sea levels rise, some people would have to adapt and move on, no doubt, but what about the huge swaths of tundra in Canada And Siberia? If the climate warmed, it would open up millions of acres for farming and development. This might actually be a huge potential opportunity not only for humans, but the animals and plants as well. <br /><br />If we somehow stopped climate change. (are you kidding me, that&#39;s impossible by the way.) Than all we&#39;d be doing is denying millions of people the opportunity to raise themselves out of poverty and improve their lives. I don&#39;t know about you, but I happen to think poverty and hunger is a much bigger problem than whether or not the temperature goes up a degree or two in the next century. (which were still waiting for).<br /><br />Rely on logic to guide you. Emotions and feelings are not the way to go and think for yourself. Just because someone with a fancy hat tells you something, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s true.	UCh0GcE3LHuCf1m6tthJ2HRA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh0GcE3LHuCf1m6tthJ2HRA	0

It&#39;s not causing terrorism, it won&#39;t cause the sea levels to rise by 20 ft., it won&#39;t cause us to go extinct, it won&#39;t make the earth go into a ice age, it won&#39;t make more people die because of extreme weather.

It&#39;s people like these and other under educated people who think they know everything about a topic because they read one article that will continue to drag our species along this slow path to our ultimate demise because they are willing to deny the facts at all cost even if they might have that voice at the back of their mind saying that &quot;Maybe we ARE screwing over the future generations of people&quot;. Don&#39;t come around blasting your rhetoric about how all the information on climate change is false and how it&#39;s a government conspiracy or something, all that shows is how weak-minded and gullible you are as individuals. Yes, weak-minded because you are willing to believe conspiracy theorists and news outlets such as Fox who simply want to push their own agendas for the benefit of their own interests such as oil companies. Want an example for you skeptics? Mitch McConnell who blocked passage of multiple bills targeting climate change due to connections in the coal industry. Don&#39;t believe me? Search it up.

In 1800 was hij nog maar 200 m dik en sindsdien is hij nog wat vermagerd. Ze vonden dat ze mee schuldig waren voor het afsmelten van de gletsjer omdat ze er met hun mobilhome naar toe gereden waren.. Ik vroeg hen of die verdwenen 600 m van voor 1800 ook het gevolg was van al die mobilhomes die en fabrieken die er toen waren. Toen was het ff stil. Ik zeg niet dat we er niet een klein beetje aan helpen maar het is de natuurlijke gang van zaken. Het is hem hoofdzakelijk te doen om wie het grootste deel van de koek gaat krijgen om het zogezegd op te lossen. Het wordt in de bevolking ingepompt net zoals de crisis. Als je vandaag niet zou weten of er morgen nog iets is om te eten , dan is het crisis. Nu smijten ze het ingepakt eten weg omdat het niet goed genoeg is. Volgens mij staan we voor een serieuze verandering op heel korte tijd en al &#39;t geld van de wereld zal er niks aan veranderen.

Climate change has occurred naturally in the Earth, and since Earth was sustainable for life. So, in my eyes, records of temperature doesn&#39;t prove much. Maybe Earth is just experiencing a new, slight change, in it&#39;s climate? Why did they rename &#39;global warming&#39; to &#39;climate change&#39;? Why hasn&#39;t there been a change in temperature for 18 years? It&#39;s not even the warmest year or day today. Look at the satellite data.<br />On top of that, NASA confirmed that plant life and nature are responsible for most of the CO2 in the atmosphere. What they did is they launched a satellite that&#39;s designed to measure CO2 in the whole Earth. They concluded that almost all of the CO2 in our atmosphere comes from rainforests and other geographic ecosystems from South America, Africa, and Asia (China). Not to mention, this satellite was launched in 2014, so it&#39;s probably very up-to-date and credible.¬†It&#39;s worth noting that 31000 scientists signed a petition saying they they don&#39;t believe in &#39;Catastrophic Man-Made Global Warming&#39;, including 9029 with PhDs. <br />P.s. I&#39;m an atheist. I&#39;m a skeptic.<br />P.s.s. I won&#39;t be sending any sources or links because i&#39;m worried this comment may be flagged for spam. If you want links, ask me.

If the Earth gets a &quot;fever&quot; to kill off the parasite humans, this is simply the way of nature. Accept it, and in the meantime, live FREE of nasty government bureaucrats who will use the natural course of things to gain power over you.

But unfortunately it&#39;s impossible to replace all conventional power sources. I&#39;m a power engineer and I can describe the situation. All power stations works in united power systems and they should follow the load which changes every minute and it&#39;s hard to predict it precisely. NPPs are the most ecological source(but thermal pollotion is high anyway) of energy but it can only work in base of load demand diagramm cause it&#39;s impossible to adjust equippment quickly. Renewables are unpredictable. e.g. solar power plants depend on weather. Wind generators are in the same situation. It&#39;s impossible to create a system which consists of only renewables couse such system can&#39;t follow load every moment. The only way is to replace conventional thermal plants by NPPs to work in base, to use hydroenergy for adjusting and try to use all possible renewables. But unfortunately we can&#39;t fully replace all conventional sources by renewable and ecological sources. I&#39;ve signed the petition. Let&#39;s try to make our world better! Thank you!

The NOAA has been caught repeatedly fudging the numbers, NASA has reported the Polar ice caps are dramatically increasing in size (even though that idiot &quot;scientist &quot; Al Gore said they would be completely melted by now), and the climate-gate email leak scandal from a couple years ago all but proved these anti-capitalist &quot;climate scientists&quot; have a political agenda. 30 years ago they were worried about &quot;global cooling&quot;, then it became &quot;global warming&quot; but since the facts kept getting in the way of their ideology, now they just conveniently call it &quot;climate change&quot; to cover anything and everything that could ever happen naturally.

The NOAA has been caught repeatedly fudging the numbers, NASA has reported the Polar ice caps are dramatically increasing in size (even though that idiot &quot;scientist &quot; Al Gore said they would be completely melted by now), and the climate-gate email leak scandal from a couple years ago all but proved these anti-capitalist &quot;climate scientists&quot; have a political agenda. 30 years ago they were worried about &quot;global cooling&quot;, then it became &quot;global warming&quot; but since the facts kept getting in the way of their ideology, now they just conveniently call it &quot;climate change&quot; to cover anything and everything that could ever happen naturally.

The tyrannical progressives have failed at education, healthcare and the ending of poverty simply because these are real problems and they are only able to make something worse. But now they have copied the biggest scam in history, the pyramid scam.<br /><br />When for 1000s of years the Egyptians were fooled into thinking that if they do not hand over their freedom, labour and wealth to a self imposed elite, the sun would not rise in the morning. A completely fabricated crisis.<br /><br />The Climate-Alarmists now have a non-issue, one that they too can not be held accountable for, and when the world does not over heat (or cools) they will take credit for it. Don&#39;t believe me, just google it, they are saying it already. Also they won&#39;t even have to build a pyramid, since they are incompetent at anything they do, they will only make thousands of useless bureaucratic jobs to enforce this tyranny.<br /><br />So they will meet in December and plot a global crushing of freedom over a non-existent crisis, while standing indifferently ankle deep in a pool of innocent blood caused by Sunni murders. <br /><br />i would if i had the money and power, change this story to what is real. it should be about freedom and be lableled<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23YoursToLose">#YoursToLose</a>: Freedom Change Affects the Things We Love<br /><br />...just saying the truth.

I probably have to actually tell you my statement is absurd since you do not understand the same argument as it pertains to carbon based life forms on planet Earth. Carbon, once released from its sepulcher under the Earth's surface does not accumulate but enters the life cycle and the sun provides the energy to keep it going round and round.

Compared to the rate that temperatures have risen in just 20 years in past climate changes (which ¬†have been recorded to rise 18 degrees F or -7 degrees Celsius in 20 years,) that isn't a lot. No, temperatures have not just been rising since 1880. I have no idea where you got that notion. "And no, there was no increase in temperature in the medieval climate optimum, reaching that level."¬† What? Do you even know what the Medieval Climate Optimum is?¬† Just because temperatures have risen since 1880 doesn't mean it was man-made. Just because this may or may not be the warmest period in the Earth's history does not mean it is man-made. The fact that climate change has happened in the past already denies that climate change is man-made.¬† Let me give you some examples. First, dinosaurs roamed Earth much longer than humans have. Considering their size, wouldn't you think that they would be producing much more CO2 than humans do annually? Secondly, the sun is much warmer than it was 4 billion years ago. Explain to me why the polar ice cap is bigger now than it was in 2012. It obviously isn't "global warming."

That is a lot! And no, there were no increase in temperature in the medievel climate optimum, reaching that level. Absolutely all sources of global temperature statistics will demonstrate that we have reached the hottest point in human history. You cannot deny that fact.

Temperatures rose just as fast or even faster than they are now, considering that it was actually warmer then. They did not have a fraction of the machines and technology that we do today. Earth has kept a pretty stable and normal climate for the past 120,000 years. "But temperatures have been rising since the Industrial Revolution." Yes, I know, putting CO2 in the air has been causing temperatures to rise, but by very, very little. CO2 only has a short lifetime of 5-7 years in the atmosphere. Technically, humans put about 8 gigatons of CO2 into the atmosphere annually, but that's small compared to the 40,000 gigatons that are already there naturally. YOU are the one who doesn't understand the issue.	UC5YYPf2rJlAXaYQgwW7nwjg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5YYPf2rJlAXaYQgwW7nwjg	1	Uggpei6mwM1jO3gCoAEC	Carl Ng

Uggpei6mwM1jO3gCoAEC.876YvTe1u8887N6vut42IW		0	2015-12-05 06:31:29	Kevin Sherman	+Jason Jones Hopefully this one will actually post (titansoftime) I had reservations mentioning the general Forbes credibility statement. I still stand by that we should not get our science education from a magazine self described as "Business News and Financial News". That was my primary point there. I'm not a Forbes reader but if this article is an example of their integrity, than yes Forbes should be dismissed entirely. The reason I disagree with the Forbes article is that it is based on a study¬†(they provide a link to it in their article) that completely says the opposite thing if you read it. A quote from the study: "Climate change could irreversibly affect future generations and, as such, is one of the most urgent issues facing organizations". I urge you to read it yourself and see what they have done. It is a painfully long and dry read. You could skip to the section near the end titled "Discussion and Conclusion" to see what I mean. Forbes is being intentionally deceitful without question. What their motivation is, I cannot say for certain. I can guess however; perhaps a majority of Forbes readers are conservatives which above all else support the wealthy (whom stand to lose the most from fossil fuel divergence). Forbes may not have ¬†personal stake in the oil industry but I doubt they would want to alienate their readers. The author of this article should be ashamed of themself and every reader should feel insulted for being bold face lied to. If climate change is a hoax, why bother lying, the evidence should speak for itself. EDIT* Hehe I found this in the comment section of the article from a fellow Forbes staff member: "I think that your headline is incredibly misleading." Yes scientist are known to cherry pick themselves. I don't believe this is a reasonable excuse for Forbes to do so in such a grotesque manner. I would like to see an example of scientists who acknowledge the existence of man-made climate change participating in cherry picking akin to what Forbes has done. I get the feeling that you are suggesting that all scientists are falsifying data. This simply cannot be true. Look at all of the remarkable achievements we have seen. All these fantastic discoveries would not be possible if scientists were just illusionists behind a curtain. Look at our medical advances, our technological advances, the advances in our knowledge of the cosmos. You cannot honestly claim that these are the results of fabrications. Now on to the democrats. Not once did I say their method of fixing the problem is the right one. They however, at least acknowledge that climate change is a problem and exists unlike their republican counterparts. Obama is just saying empty nothings at COP21, all just hot air (no pun intended). One thing that climatologists suggest is a cap and trade that moves the money to the people and not the government. Even if it was through some sort of social program (like I dunno..investing in renewable energy technologies), I would be ok with that. Solar, wind, and hydro-electric are efficient ready to go technologies, they simply lack funding to be put in place on a large scale. I for one think it's time to start the migration towards 100% renewable energy. Technologies grow old, die and are replaced by new ones, this is how technological progress works. The reason we have not moved on already is money, as always. It all comes down to money, and whose got it (not me.. not you... oil companies..oh yea). I'll ask once more; who stands to lose the most for being wrong on this issue?	UCj3qWUvNckZy976S7__46HQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj3qWUvNckZy976S7__46HQ	1	Uggpei6mwM1jO3gCoAEC	Carl Ng

I get it, and to a point agree. Be skeptical, think for yourself. Research what you can, question authority. I am right there with you on that mentality. The difference is I have faith in numbers I suppose. If a majority of scientist on an international level have consensus, I am going to lean in their direction. As someone who does not have a background in environmental science I have little choice. The alternative is to fall into an infinite regress of lies, which leads to paranoia and I am not going to fall into that trap.

Nobody I know, me included, is against clean air or water and you cannot deny in 2015 we've made HUGE gains in these areas from the 60s and 70s. But leftist progressives don't care about that because merely doing what we have already done doesn't line their pockets like "carbon credits" and further government "programs" that are nothing but waste, fraud and abuse. They want your SUV to cost $50,000 and your evil gas to cost $5.00 a gallon. Obama said it himself, "under my plan of a cap and tax system, energy rates will necessarily skyrocket." That's what they want and THAT'S what we oppose. And since there so very limited data... What? Maybe 100 years of data at best... when we have 5,000 years of recorded human history... we can't possibly know what is normal, what is cyclical, what is completely normal. We just can't know. And again, if man caused carbon emissions are our problem, and 100 years we go from ZERO to 10.3 billion metric tonnes a year, then why has the NOAA admitted to "no significant increases in average temperature since 1998"??? If one had anything to do with the other then it should be obvious. It's certainly not. 0.116 degree per DECADE! Sorry, I don't fear 0.116 degrees when from summer to winter we fluctuate around 56 degrees!

I am just a software engineer. I do see an upward trend on his chart though which is in C, if it were in F it would be a sharper increase. I can't really argue the figures though as you pointed out, he is more than likely "smarter" than me. This does not necessarily make him correct though. People make mistakes and this is only one person. Read the comments below the article and you will see that there is not consensus with the results. I DO find it hard to believe that climate change (man-made of course) is some kind of global conspiracy. What do we have to lose by reducing CO2 emissions? The oil / gas companies will see a decline of profits. This is not really my concern. I live in the Houston area of TX and can tell you that the air smells literally like farts. People in industrial areas of China have to wear masks to even be outside. Why not make an effort to clean the air EVEN IF climate change is a mistake. Why are people so against protecting our environment? I honestly believe it's built on propaganda released by those who will sustain monetary damage from emissions cuts. It's not that far fetched. My intentions are not to be arrogant or make ignorant assertions. I really want to know why so many people want to fight the movement for cleaner energy, what do they have to lose? I'll restate my prior point: who has the most to lose if they are wrong? I would really appreciate an answer from deniers.

However, I really am going to need you to cite your sources before I can entertain your opinion of the current climate trend not being man-made. I will happily read any scientific study as long as the authors names are published. You could of course disclose your own scientific credentials, which would bring some validity to your claims. I am merely trusting that 90% of the scientific community might be on to something. I have to mention, the separation of church makes sense as religion is based on 0 evidence and has an unhappy history of destroying civilizations along with it's atrocities against what we believe to be human rights. You must admit this is something of an apples and oranges comparison.¬† The government isn't out to get you. The system is severely flawed and corrupted but how would promoting climate change (this is a global thing of course not just the US, was it 190 nations at COP21? Talk about a HUGE conspiracy) really hurt you? If the environmental scientists are wrong... big deal, some more wasted tax dollars and electric cars. If they are right...hundred of millions of years of evolution, thousands of generations of families all for nothing, we all die. I'd rather be safe than sorry in this case. Again if they are wrong and we reduce CO2 emissions, what's the big downside? Both sides can be viewed as conspiracy from the alternate point of view.

Can you describe the difference in its climate today vs what it was like before the industrial revolution? How much shorter or longer is the growing season today? How much less or more precipitation today? May I assume that you have no clue?¬† It may have escaped your notice, but the the Earth has no climate but rather millions of micro climates. Can you identify which ones were or are to impacted by "man made global climate change" So far I have escaped all of these areas and I have lived in more than a dozen places from the USA to the Orient to Africa. ¬† No, the melting North American Glaciers are not evidence of recent climate change but are due to climate change that occurred over 10,000 years ago when glaciers covered most of the Northern states up to a mile deep. They are still melting. ¬† When Captain Cook visited Glacier Bay in Alaska he was told how much the the glacier had receded in the lifetimes of the Inuit who lived there. That was in the late 1700s; did the Inuits offend nature? . ¬† So lets get real and leave fantasy land behind, I believe in government science even less than government health care. I have plenty of evidence as to how it is as corrupt as the theocratic state. ¬† We don't allow the marriage of state and religion so how can we allow the marriage of science and state as both Stalin and Hitler required? Do you doubt Nazi or Soviet scientists or were they as pure as ours? Witch doctors (shamen) held that human behavior was responsible for bad weather. They required "sacrifice" on the part of others to ameliorate the fury of nature , as our people become increasingly ignorant, due primarily due to government "education" (really just socialist indoctrination) they become easy prey for our modern shamen and liberty rippers (politicians) ¬† We are now too stupid as a people to maintain our liberty.

It makes me question how much the government actually has a part in making climate change such a popular idea. My assumption is that the idea is popular because it's widely credited in Academia. It's more convincing than saying that the government wants to **** people over with it.¬† ¬†At least hardly anything that they suggested that they would do.The country would produce less revenue by consuming fewer resources. So how do you see the government getting a material advantage from this? Take a guess at who dislikes climate change? The scientists or the oil barons? Well, take your pick.

Strange science" No, I don't understand how you made up that analogy or what it has to do with the topic. Assuming that the scientists were liars (which I doubt they are), I'm sure they would be more artful in their misinformation, or maybe they are just dumb. I guess I never sat down to consider that. But in all seriousness, the latter possibility that I mentioned appears to be highly unlikely.¬† ¬†It's fair that anyone has doubts about climate change being as profound as it is often shown or the processes used to measure it. But to call global warming a farce as so many do in the comments and not trusting what the majority geologists and scientists have to say, is something that I would consider unreasonable. I don't think that those who have doubts should be bullied without having their suggestions reviewed, but the same principle applies with commentators like "Itsa Mea". If you disagree with climate change, then you should at least be qualified enough to contest the observations of those who do agree that it occurs. If you merely use your own suspicion or intuition, then you are likely to receive a result that is confused or untrue.¬† Ask your self this: what does the government gain in any sort of material by convincing its people that global warming does occur? That is assuming that the government is willfully dishonest in the first place.	UC7ze5B0qx3S0CGdQPEFH75w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7ze5B0qx3S0CGdQPEFH75w	1	Uggpei6mwM1jO3gCoAEC	Carl Ng

Anything. :)" I can deduce that that's probably how it looks like from the other side, but I'll just ignore that. ¬†"The 97% consensus from scientists was a total fabrication." I'm sure the figure in reality roughly approaches that figure. I do believe that climate change is widely agreed upon by the experts. So, I'll substantiate with a trustworthy source, to demonstrate the agreement over this issue held by the professionals.¬† http://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/ I guess you doubt NASA too. Oh and the moon landing! ¬†"The temperature has always changed, and always will." And a triangle has three sides. "Any rate of change is within the rate of error." You don't know what you're talking about. The issue is that the rate of change in average temperature over time has accelerated to the point that it is concerning. Of course the Earth's average temperature has changed over time, but the issue now is that the average temperature change is increasing quite quickly.¬† "Don't trust people that are being paid to prove a pre-determined outcome." Who knows, I think you give them too little credit. Either way, I would trust those who have expertise on the subject rather than those who call those experts scam artists without any expertise of their own. I recommend for you to do the same thing. "Government grants to prove humans are the cause." No, governments give grants to researchers so that they can produce studies and expand our scientific knowledge. You're thinking about oil companies that actually do sponsor for biased results from some researchers, the governments in most Western Nations tend not to be as corrupt as you're implying. "Anyone to says otherwise is labelled a denier, and gets no funding." They sure do get funding from the oil companies.¬† "The solution that you suggest is we start eliminating humans," No I didn't even come close to implying that. Seriously, how did you get that. My point is that we should worry about climate change because IT might eliminate humans if we don't do enough to prevent it. "cause humans are the cause right? More humans, more damage to mother earth." Humans are negative contributors, so they are a cause in a way. I don't think humans should be eliminated at all, but we are damaging the planet and making it more difficult to live on. Entire islands where humans live are actually facing increased floods and other consequences that North Americans tend to be unable to acknowledge.¬†	UC7ze5B0qx3S0CGdQPEFH75w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7ze5B0qx3S0CGdQPEFH75w	1	Uggpei6mwM1jO3gCoAEC	Carl Ng

While animals etc. were made to be ruled over, people were made to join God in freedom. All the cosmos are less capable of relaying the glory of God than we are. God, in the English NIV translation, says &quot;fill the earth and subdue it.&quot; God gave us authority and responsibility over this planet, and if we are given enough power to take care of it, we are more than capable in destroying it. We have a fairly clear authority over ourselves, and that authority when used incorrectly has had disastrous results. Since we have authority over the earth, we then have the capability to have caused something like climate change.	UCISMAdOTPnuez31gBosWZ5g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCISMAdOTPnuez31gBosWZ5g	0

What you are referring to is called CO2 fertilization, a stabilizing feedback. This stabilizing feedback, all else equal, should be large enough to counter emissions, given a healthy environment. But the environment is not healthy, and this stabilizing feedback is far too small to counteract fossil fuel emissions. Second factor often neglected is that leaves are not all created equal. While C4 plants (mostly grasses) represent only 3 % of species, they represent a disproportionately large % by more than an order of magnitude of photosynthesis due to higher efficiency. They also do better at lower atmospheric CO2 levels. Those same grasses while temporarily fixing more CO2 also have a mature phase with highly increased albedo. (amber waves of grain?) And the 4th factor is instead of producing a woody trunk, c4 grasses put 30% or more of those increased products of photosynthesis directly into the soil in what is called the "liquid carbon pathway". Not only is a higher rate of carbon fixed, but a much higher % is directed into the stable carbon pool as opposed to the labile carbon pool. This "greening" is actually part of a transition to lower efficiency plant species in some areas and part of the long slow process of desertification in some areas as well. (less soil carbon holds less water in the soil to hold plants over through a drought) So while you can claim that "CO2 makes trees grow" if you wish. It is true. But digging deeper into the highly nuanced interactions of different ecosystems and the ecosystem services they provide, actually brings a different result than one might expect. Depending where those increased trees are growing this could actually in some cases make it even worse.

They cycle carbon and reduce global warming, actually REDUCING net methane as long as they are raised on healthy grasslands instead of feedlots. This due to increases in soil microbiology numbers in the soils of grazed grasslands including methanotrophs.¬† Second of all I agree the middle classes need regenerated to have a healthy economy. Explain to me why family farmers are not considered middle classes? Why would getting rid of feedlots which are run by large corporations and a major cause of AGW and replacing them with family farms that mitigate AGW and help restore the middle classes with hard working family farmers be detrimental to either the economy or be socialist? You have set up a false dichotomy in your mind. Try using common sense instead. Just because some idiot socialists have latched onto AGW with socialist plans to control our future, doesn't make AGW itself socialist. There can be conservative capitalist plans to both build the economy and mitigate AGW too.

These refugees are the victims of politics mixed with religion, not the weather. Traditional religions have he same potential for abuse as does our state religion of environmentalism.

My point exactly. Not only would the typical liberal proposed solutions have absolutely no chances of working, they also harm the infrastructure of modern society if attempted to be applied at this time in our technological development. There is a mitigation plan that helps rebuild infrastructure though, does not require oppressive regulation or tax and spend government regulations though, and actually spurs economic growth. The reason it can do all that is because it is actually PROFITABLE. Therefore there is no need to force a reluctant citizenry to adopt it. All that is needed is to eliminate the regulatory burden and subsides restricting its adoption. This mean LESS taxes, not more. It means MORE freedom, not less. AND most importantly, it actually has a pretty good chance of working, unlike the liberal plans to eliminate fossil fuels. I still have a problem with your state of denial on AGW though.

My IQ is over 140, I've traveled the world over on data communications projects as a design engineer. I read extensively on this subject as well and many others including philosophy and especially epistemology. I am not a "believer" in science, just a practitioner of it. I'm certain my abilities in math and the physical sciences would leave you in the dust. You are talking nonsense, there exists no empirical data that suggests that the 0.0004 part of the atmosphere that is CO2 is driver of the Earth's climate. It is an important gas to be sure since all life on Earth must feed upon it either directly or indirectly and this is precisely why it is so rare. It's just that this tiny concentration has very little effect upon atmospheric physics and all of the fanciful models that claim it does are based upon fictitious "positive feedback" that have never been an observed part of the Earth's climate system. ¬† We have seen carbon dioxide levels at 20 times the levels we observe now during the Precambrian with no link to observed increases in temperature accompanying these high natural levels. Higher CO2 levels have been associated with periods of far more rich biological diversity than we see today (mesozoic and cenozoic) and yet the temperature was roughly the same as it is today. Humans from prehistory have thrived in environments from -60F to +130F and this phony science dare's suggest that a (speculated , but never proven) change in one degree F will end life as we know it.

An end to taxing me to support this socialist religion and of forcing others to comply with its "commandments:" ¬† You are entitled to self-flagellate and "mitigate" what you perceive are your "carbon sins" to your heart's content. As for me I want no part of your religion; leave me alone I don't want to join up and sing songs in praise of socialism.. "Thou shalt not burn the fuel of the Gods (socialist big shots)" We had a system that determined what worked and had value, it was called freedom of "choice" Its worked very well for the USA. People are literally dying to have a chance at a piece of what remains of what we once had. ¬† There is another system in which the big shots(socialist thieves) make the important decisions for us: North Korea, Cuba, Venezuela come to mind. Who is dying to get there?	UC0jDJqdKsB-slq_NVEDRSbA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0jDJqdKsB-slq_NVEDRSbA	1	UggYRqn0IcUYkngCoAEC	godspeeding
UggYRqn0IcUYkngCoAEC.876XKTllCds8AFhBdXQ-VB		0	2016-02-14 22:57:20	Red Baron Farm	+Bruce Frykman The topic on this commentary section is AGW. So it is possible you might consider any attempt to mitigate AGW to be "guarding the Earth" as you put it. However, as a conservative Christian Republican farmer, I don't view the issue in that way. Instead I look at it from the Biblical perspective of good stewardship of the Earth.¬† In truth it really doesn't matter much whether you take the scientific perspective or the religious perspective, to all intents and purposes they are not in conflict on this issue. In fact even the philosophical perspective, the practical perspective, the ethical perspective, you name it, none are in conflict. Only the ignorant deny AGW. Only the fool ignores the opportunity for mitigation. Where I differ with liberals on this issue is in mitigation strategy. The liberal mitigation agenda for AGW has two major flaws. First it is designed more for their leftist social agenda than to actually fix any problems. Secondly it has absolutely NO chances of actually mitigating AGW at all. Zip zero nada none. If we all planet wide stopped using all fossil fuels 100% tomorrow, we would still have AGW for several hundreds of years to even potentially thousands of years. That's not a solution. But conservative mitigation proposals at least have a chance of mitigating AGW in as short a time frame as decades. So what would you prefer? The leftist agenda that costs tremendous amounts of money to implement and has no hope of working? Or a conservative solution that has no cost, is actually profitable and can potentially even work?

Earth can provide enough for the millions of us, as long as we know how to distribute what it gives us. Some people have more than enough to share with three or four other people. When some people use way to much of Earth's supplies sure there are going to be some people who look like they are the extra ones that Earth can't care for. When everyone has exactly as much as they need to live and there still are people that are hungry then you can come back with this overpopulation nonsense.*	UCL3rH26cyvlailk_i7D13Yg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL3rH26cyvlailk_i7D13Yg	1	UggYRqn0IcUYkngCoAEC	godspeeding

The fact we have widespread soil degradation and human caused desertification is in fact evidence of overpopulation, because it is unsustainable land use.¬† There are other lines of evidence as well, like dwindling ocean fisheries. They are being harvested at a higher rate than they can replace themselves. Not saying we can't fix these problems, but right now, by definition, this is overpopulation.

Google "overpopulation" and Google "carrying capacity". Should be clear enough to anyone with a third grade education or better. The link I gave wasn't proof of the definition, it was proof that human society is currently overpopulated by definition. "The¬†carrying capacity¬†of a biological species in an environment is the maximum population size of the species that the environment can sustain indefinitely, given the food, habitat, water, and other necessities available in the environment." So if the agricultural land is deteriorating at such a rapid rate, that current trends allow only ~60 years or so before the World's top soils are gone, (according to Scientific American, a very reputable science journal) Then it certainly can't "sustain indefinitely" can it? So by definition it is overpopulation. And there are 2 possible solutions to correct that, either reduce the population and rest agricultural land as fallow so that when one patch of land gets degraded, we can rest it and move to another patch that has regenerated.......or.....we can change the way we do agriculture to regenerative models of production. The side benefit to the later is that because regenerative models of production sequester carbon, it also solves AGW simultaneously, and no need to disrupt entire countries' economies meeting unrealistic emissions regulations.

There are two solutions, decrease the population or increase the carrying capacity of the land. Of those two, the ethical and moral choice is to increase the carrying capacity of the land. Interesting thing about that is animals can help us do that by regenerating the function of our agricultural ecosystems. Interesting thing about that is it will also have a side effect of mitigating global warming by sequestering a net increase of carbon in the soil.

This problem of is fundamentally a mathematical problem. Most everyone cannot see that. The only mathematical way overpopulation has reached the extent it has correlates directly to Big Ag which ENABLED overpopulation with modern methods of crop production.¬† What is more important is who enabled Big Ag? It was only made possible by an overreaching central bank which funded these corporations through illegal printing of trillions after legislation is passed through the senate. By ARTIFICIALLY printing unimaginable quantities of USD and loaning it to sectors such as Big Ag, Military, and Pharma, They have ARTIFICIALLY created overpopulation as well as a host of other problems.

The &quot;science&quot; was never in, no scientific method used. And even if you go by the IPCC&#39;s own numbers, at best we would make .17c difference while spending trillions of dollars. Provided ALL nations actually agreed to all of this (I&#39;m looking at you China) we would subjugate the world and destroy it&#39;s economy for something that happens with or without us. Also, droughts happen and the plants like the warmth (see previous to ice age records) as well as co2. It&#39;s the co that is bad for us all in large amounts. Go real science ftw.

And more painful even those whose heads have been washed by the economic interests of big energy companies, who finance all this propaganda agencies such as the IPCC. It is you precisely with your stubbornness and ecological fanaticism, who you promote your business.<br />The climate has always changed and will continue to change, with or without man. And so, one thing is the weather and other environmental pollution is, if man is caused.<br />CO2 is not the main factor, not even one of its supporting actors; rather the Sun and its activity.<br />Look for; research; develop your critical thinking.<br />If current technology are not able to predict with 50% more likely what the weather next week, why rely precisely forecasting models that predict how many degrees does not increase at the end of the century?<br />Start inform you about the relationship sunspots and the little ice age ... maybe, just maybe, begin to awaken.

Prior to the 1900s, has our planet's average temperature ever been warmer than it is today over the last 5000 years?" How would you go about verifying the average temperature of the entire earth 3000 BC? How could you verify its accuracy and its error bars. Many say it was warmer during the medieval warming period when the great cathedrals were being built in Europe. Others say it was warmer during the Roman Republic. There is a lot of empirical evidence for this; taking the world of the fruitcakes at NASA etc just doesn't do it for me. They all "say for pay."

Why didn't those 4,593 metric tons cause global warming??? ¬†Well, in 2011, man's carbon emissions had increased to 9,449. ¬†So from 1975 to 2011 man added an additional 4,856 metric tons of carbon emissions. ¬†Now, think about that for just one moment of intellectual honesty. ¬†If man, from 1751 to 1975 had increased carbon emissions by 4600 metric tons and the planet was cooling, then how is it possible that an additional 4800 metric tons would suddenly cause warming? ¬†And once more it needs to be stated for those without any common sense: the TOTAL percentage of man-caused carbon put into the planet's atmosphere is just 0.00000187% of the total atmosphere of the planet! ¬†1.87 MILLIONTH of a percent! ¬†You're being lied to... you are being deceived... by those with an agenda to control and deflect in order to steal wealth. ¬†It's so easy to steal wealth from the uneducated if you can just convince them they are in danger and you are there to save them. ¬†And if they are so stupid to believe the unbelievable, how much more easy is it to steal their wealth. ¬†Al Gore became sloppy rich by convincing the ignorant of man-caused global warming... this is the SAME man that thought the planet's core was "several million degrees..." and the SAME man whereby ALL of his alarmist predictions didn't come true! ¬†LOL!

ROFL! ¬†And it's even more awesome that you say the NOAA, NASA, and UCAR are liars in the data when they are the biggest supporters of the LIE of man-caused global warming! ¬†And my point with the Gulf oil spill was to make the point that just because "experts" say something is "going to destroy... going to be really really bad... blah blah blah" (which they did with that Gulf oil spill), doesn't make it true (which it wasn't with the Gulf oil spill). ¬†Sorry you "didn't know what to make of that" but I get why you couldn't given how lost you are on all the other points.

Why is it you continue with bald faced lies? And you try to minimise the effect a degree C of warming, but that is a world wide average, including oceans. It may seem small but it is enough to allow rain at the N pole in December! It is enough to flood many coastal areas, or allow salt water intrusion into farmland groundwater. It is plenty enough to cause havoc already, and all it takes is one more degree C and massive problems begin happening. We are already 1/2 way there! Going to be real hard to stop it. But we can, just barely, if we change agriculture to something sane.¬† As far as name calling. This thread was started by "The amount of idiots in this comment section hurts my brain."

Solves or at least is a major start to solving almost everything on that list. All that really has to happen is idiot deniers ¬†to get out of the way and governments to stop subsidizing AGW.¬† See I don't know for certain, but I highly suspect that the main true objection to AGW has nothing to do with science. Rather more likely they simply object to left wing politics.So do I. But I am not foolish enough to cut off my own nose to spite my face. The reason the leftist own the issue is that conservative politicians are too stupid to understand that AGW denial guarantees that the only solutions will be tied to socialist political agenda. Want a reasonable conservative solution? Make a conservative plan for mitigation. Making no plan forfeits the race before it even starts.

Also, ask the Islamic world to stop expansion by procreation (the rest of us are already doing just that...yeah!). Also,¬†stop sipping the Cool-Aide; get a grip. Our solar system - for better or worse, will determine &quot;Global Warming and Global Cooling&quot;. The latter will become more of a concern, as our star/sun continues on¬†its galactic journey. So sorry.Realistically,¬†a major¬†problem¬†is &quot;water extraction&quot; - seriously! Many aquifers are being &quot;tapped&quot; (thousands of gallons daily) without much ado by Nestle and its subsidiaries (Deer Park, etc) resulting in depletion and or pollution of these fresh water ecosystems. Look it up. We&#39;re bound to have second thoughts when our faucets have a problem (and the toilets don&#39;t flush).Until then, let&#39;s stop &quot;Global Sweating&quot; and minimize &quot;Global Peristalsis&quot;...

The end of sustainable atmosphere in 15 years should shut them up. It will shut us all up because there will be no more life in the northern hemisphere and the same will be said about the southern hemisphere 10 years later. &quot;I told you so&quot; will not be able to be spoken... at least by inhabitants of earth.

It&#39;s all a political and money game. Reports have come out that have analyzed raw data and found that the earth has been cooling over the last 40 years. There really is not enough evidence out there to launch a multi-trillion dollar effort on a futile attempt to change the climate of the planet. Some people want to scare the money out of your pockets. It happens in other industries such as the medical industry as well. Don&#39;t be a victim of this fraud. Yes, perhaps the climate will change, but it happens over tens of thousands of years. We will adapt as a species day by day. Would you like something real to worry about that will impact humanity and the environment in less than ten years, and has already impacted us? How about the widespread use of pesticides and herbicides? How about genetically modified organisms (GMOs)? How about the widespread use of growth hormones and antibiotics in our livestock?

Climate is controlled by countless factors both within the atmosphere and other Earth systems, and if such a minute change would cause the collapse of life on Earth, then life never would have begun in the first place.

So if people are really serious, they should write letters to the Chines, Indian and Mexican Presidents to spend money on it. Why should America(ns) pay for cleaning everyone else&#39;s trash!!?? It is infuriating that our elected officials keep handing our money to other countries instead of putting it back in our country or giving it back to us!!

The only thing we can do is &quot;slow it down&quot;... but the climate will change, it will be worse in time, and there is nothing humans will be able to &quot;fix&quot;.. with new technology comes great and bad things, mostly bad even if it looks good.. we have sucked everything from mother earth since day one, how will you even be able to change the climate? we already have people even in dubai people playing gods trying to change the weather only to the way that suits them... Think for a second, what are we humans able to do to UNDO all of this bad things that is happening? we cant even make peace with each other.. and you talk about climate change..sounds a bit far out if you ask me..

Science has not categorically proven that climate change is solely and purely man made. The particular segment in the scientific community that predicates this simply cannot do that without cherry picking only those factors that support their theory. That makes it sound like a &quot;conspiracy&quot;, which makes independent thinkers mad. This is pathetic, those who support their hegemonic theory are pathetic, and the politicians that stand to capitalize on this foolishness are also pathetic. And so are the idiots in this video clip. You need to get out more and do a reality check.	UCO8b6EEBdk_5DsA1wJ9oB0A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO8b6EEBdk_5DsA1wJ9oB0A	0

Look I get it, you want to believe what your mainstream news media is telling you, and would love to support the big oil company researchers shill out whatever data they want. One side has massive profit minded objectives in mind, and pay millions to have their puppets in congress. What stands to be gained for the global climate representatives? Extra votes from eco friendly people, the hippy agenda? It is an objective fact that since 1880 the temperature has rose on an average of 1.4 degrees, this seems like nothing until you take into account that the amount of energy it takes for it to rise throughout the entire planet is astonishing. Not to even mention that since 1970 2/3 of the 1.4 degrees had risen in less than 50 years. Of course we go throughout natural climate changes, problem is, our lowest low becomes higher, and the highest high even more so. Drought may not be happening in your region but it sure as hell is in some.	UCReHJkho0TzTNqRR3qXhoIA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCReHJkho0TzTNqRR3qXhoIA	0		
Ughgrc5zQPX34ngCoAEC	0	1	2015-11-28 18:18:38	Peter b	And why exactly should we believe in man made global warming when it is only based on computer models? computer models created by people who want climate change to exist, regardless of the true science. And can anyone here at all give a factual, scientific explanation as to why those very same computer models your willing to spend TRILLIONS of dollars for - do not include water vapor? Water vapor makes up 95% of all greenhouse gases. How can any serious scientist leave out 95% of the input to a computer model and believe the output(s)? What happened to Michael Mann&#39;s hockey stick graph? It was completely wrong. Did you know he admitted in his own emails, along with &quot;Dr.&quot; Paul Jones of E. Angela University they &quot;massaged&quot; the numbers? They changed their numbers when their computer models were showing cooling, they changed them again when their computer models did not show enough warming. Come on Americans - ask some hard quesitons before jumping on this nonsense. Dr. Mann - the guy is an associate professor who teaches undergrads how to be weatherman. A nobel profession, but not when he declares and represents himself as a full blown professional &quot;climate scientist&quot;. I have their emails where these ICCP &quot;scientists&quot; admitted lying, admitted fudging their numbers. And they just left out data from earlier times which would have completely screwed up their computer model outputs - do you all know they did this? Have you spoken to former and CURRENT ICCP panel scientists who disagree that there is man made global warming? I have - there are numerous ones. Many got fired because they questioned the data, the computer models, the errors they found in the statistical modeling used by the likes of &quot;Dr.&quot; Jones and Mann. It is a complete fraud people.	UC24-BhiM50mU1omHylW3B7Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC24-BhiM50mU1omHylW3B7Q	0

Secondly, climate change is real. Global warming is a process the world will go through whether humans exist or not.The Earth goes between heating and cooling sessions. (Global warming and ice ages.) But, climate change has been depicted as a negative because it is an inconvenience to us as a species. We aren't causing climate change, but we are making it worse. Though global warming is a theory, so is gravity and evolution and it is real. Islands and animals have already been lost and we do run the risk of it harming humans.

UgiZRY1aJRMnMngCoAEC.876MHakNHNZ876TdZIrvtZ		13	2015-11-28 19:22:52	Ray Phil	According to NASA Satellite Data there has been no measurable change in the earths temperature in the past 20 years.¬† Also I am 57 years old according to personal experience when I was younger we often experienced 100+ temps in the summer, sometimes a week or longer in a row. We seldom if ever experience these high temps. anymore. According to Global warming disciples our coastal cities should already be under water, yet this 20 year old prediction never happened, hence the change from global warming to climate change.¬†The earth experiences climate shifts all thru recorded history, tropic to ice age, long before man. There are areas where man is hurting the planet, mercury and heavy metals, chemicals and radioactive water leaks from nuke plants. These are real concerns. Climate change is far from proven and if you would actually research you would find that most scientist don't agree or believe there is insufficient evidence to support the claim. I don't expect to change your mind, most people are disciples of their own opinion and refuse to use their own experience or that of others, instead they allow themselves to be led by the nose into slavery.¬† At recent senate hearings on the subject Ted Cruz presented the data from NASA, response from Climate change disciples, there is no debate the subject has already been decided. Wake up, this has nothing to do with saving the planet and everything to do with a global government. If all these Nations cared about the planet why are they standing by watching as millions of gallons of Nuclear water is dumped from the damaged nuke plant in Japan. Why are they not shutting down nuclear plants around the country that are leaking contaminated water into our groundwater instead the EPA just raises the parts per million numbers to allow them to keep open. Look at the Oil spill in the gulf, could have been closed easily with explosives, but BP would have lost millions and they would have never been allowed to reopen well, so the government sat back took payoffs and let them destroy an entire ecosystem¬†$$$ is what it's about and power over the people. It's not necessary to give up our sovereignty to clean up and be more responsible, if you check all these big summits it always comes down to a world government. Keep trying to make your world a better place but never place your life and liberty in the hands of others, it always ends with slaughter.

If anything it provides a cooling affect. CO2 from fossil fuels contributes 3-4% of the total annual contribution to the atmosphere. The majority comes from the oceans as they warm from solar activity and our orbital cycles. CO2 levels lag temp, not the other way around.

UggoFTM56RrGA3gCoAEC	0	0	2015-11-28 18:10:23	Mr Pete	A few simple facts:<br />- All of the climate models predicted much more warming than took place over the last 15 years<br />- None of the climate models can even be tuned to match what happened. Therefore they are missing important factor(s)<br />- Most of the modern warming took place before the industrial revolution, ie before human impact on carbon was significant<br />- The global UN climate change effort (IPCC) does not look at natural sources. That&#39;s not their purpose.<br />- No proposed action has any supporting evidence that it will or even could reduce warming significantly<br />- The latest research strongly suggests that natural sources, specifically amplified indirect effects of solar activity, are major sources.<br /><br />I.e., we are proposing trillions in expense to take action that has unknown impact against a problem that has never been demonstrated to be due to human activity in the first place.

People *think* they are gathering facts from the field... but it is very very hard to do so without bias. For example: suppose you collect data but it is not quite enough to get to the hallowed 9th percentile. so you collect more data and check. not quite there. do it a couple more times. no cheating... just keep collecting truly 'random' samples until you get to 9th percentile. Result: if you add more data a few times like that, you have just pushed the odds of a false positive result over 50%. Yes it is that hard to do it right. Yet in climate science bad practices are rampant, almost universal... particularly among the vociferous alarmists. biased collection; data snooping; reuse of samples; invalid analysis; treating noise as data and data as noise... on and on.

Ditto for the UN (we pick up the bill of all of this). Every year the IPCC holds a huge festive Gala in which thousands of people fly to a world class destination to party and feast while staying at the executive suites of 5 star hotels. Our "leader" flies in with his personal fleet of Jumbo Jets (six in all) just to ferry his skinny butt, his personal helicopters, his personal limousines and assorted grooms cooks barbers and "his man" (heh heh) to the big party. We pay for all of this partying. While at their party, they dine on New Zealand Lamb, South African Lobster Tail, French Fois Gras, Caspian Sea Caviar and wash it all down with vintage wines and Dom Perignon Champagne. After filling their bellies they retire to the sitting room to stand by a glowing fireplace with a snifter of Remy Martin VSOP cognac in their right hand and a fine Cuban cigar in their left to ponder at the dangers of letting little the little people light a fire to keep the frost off their toes. This years Paris party produced enough CO2 (remember its a gas) to outweigh the largest aircraft carrier in the US fleet by a factor of more than three-fold (six hundred million pounds of CO2 for their two week party extravaganza) And you are their cheerleader...how pathetic	UC0jDJqdKsB-slq_NVEDRSbA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0jDJqdKsB-slq_NVEDRSbA	1	Ugj17pulGOex8XgCoAEC	Patrick Burke Clason

Given the same conditions and you don't trust yourself with an electric device (although you are an electrician), you can go the holistic route. Hydrogen peroxide therapy.

The problem is that, in my case at least, having done that I came to the sad realization that these "summits" are not the answer. Most the backlash isn't against the concept that humans are actually indeed causing damage to the environment, but rather the political hacks using the issue to promote their ulterior agendas. Just look at it. The vegans suddenly latched onto it to promote their vegetarianism agenda, the liberals latched onto it to promote their New World Order and socialism agenda, Conservatives are against the issue, not due to the evidence, but rather to simply oppose the leftists represented by Al Gore. There are plenty of others too, each with their own ulterior motives to enter the fray, both for or against. Meanwhile the environment continues to suffer even though there are alternatives to every cause of AGW. Science has done a very good job of, discovering the problem, defining the problem, predicting the magnitude of the problem, and even solving the problem. But in each case at every level politics has succeeded in mucking up the works. This summit will be no different. It has failed before it even started because only 1/2 the problem is even on the table. If somehow everyone grows balls and actually comes to an agreement of zero emissions tomorrow, it will do nothing but slow the inevitable.

I'm not saying that I don't believe in global warming, but actually that the way that human beings are dealing with it is very irrational. Until now, anthropic global warming is characterized as an projection of the explanation on the correlation between the increase of CO2 concentration in atmosphere and increase of global temperature. This projections and explanation don't fit the data, and don't give right predictions. So, is hopeless models. I think that is time for humanity to do climate research in right way, and don't put this apocalyptic expectation as a starting point. Certainly this would be more great to the survive of human being in the universe. Countries in developments need to increase the CO2 emission to fight against poverty, hunger, and scarcity. They don't have sufficient I.Q. and knowledge to fight against this problems and control the levels of CO2 emission.

The Ice Age on this place holds a patter of one per about 125.000 years, quite predictable, and immediately after the Ice Age, their is a temperature peak of around +9¬∞C from the Ice Age. Currently, this means the last peaks were all around +2¬∞C. The temperature on the planet has been decreasing steadly since it's formation: when it dropped below +10¬∞C life was possible, when it dropped below +6¬∞C life on dry land was possible. "Do you believe millions upon millions of years ago the middle temperature, when no humans existed at all were also caused by humans?" - I will ignore this, this is just stupid "If not, what is your explaination to that?" - the cooling of every single planet on the universe after its initial hot formation. Like every planet, Earth is cooling. Several cycles cause increase or decrease in temperatures, the biggest ones are the ones from Ice Ages, but El√±ino, El√±ina, Sun-activity and others also have effects, though absolutely none have a trend on the climate, only the hard fact that all planets loose energy with time is the trend. "Do you believe the temperature was constant for like 4 billion years and just changed drastically in the last (about) 50-100 years." Half a billion years the temperature was as high as +12¬∞C from current average, it went on the cycles but, as expected, the average was reducing. Temperatures dont get past +2¬∞C for at least 100 million years. The average Temperature at this moment should be around -0.7¬∞C, with the natural variation of up to 1¬∞C that means at most +0.3¬∞C, there is no explanation, on all history, for why it is +1¬∞C (way hotter than nature explains) other than artificial increase on greenhouse gasses by humans, be it fossil fuels or huge livestocks "It's a proven fact that no increase of the world's middle temperature has been recorded in the last 15+ years." - Really? I think you take 10 seconds to find out prove on contrary, and I think it would me forever to find such "proven fact" that the temperature has not increased, since 2015 was the highest GAAT on record - ever. 2010 was the highest before that, and 2005 before that. This is the first time since the post-Ice Age peak that GAAT got to +1¬∞C, if that is not warming, what is it? "How do you explain those facts?" - your lack of knowledge is the only explanation of imaginary 'facts' "Or do you think science was wrong the last 50+ years when claiming there were cooling periods ("ice ages") and warming periods accuring on this planet? " - Science has warned about global warming exactly 50 years ago, in 1965. Your lack of understanding of multiple trends is amazing, here are some: Natural Planetary: Cooling Natural Climate Cycle: 125.000 years currently -8¬∞C to +2¬∞C GAAT ENSO peak (El√±ino): variable, averages each 8 years, +0.5¬∞C GAAT ENSO low (El√±ina): immediatly after an El√±ino, -0.5¬∞C GAAT Sun activity: widely variable, +- 0.5¬∞C Normal deviation from natural planetary cooling: estimated +- 0.5¬∞C plus all the above Expected GAAT for 2015 given 1 billion years of trends: -0.7¬∞c +- 1¬∞C = top +0.3¬∞C' Current GAAT: +1¬∞C	UCTLAVEZfvu7MZMjYKIeIqsQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTLAVEZfvu7MZMjYKIeIqsQ	1	Ugj17pulGOex8XgCoAEC	Patrick Burke Clason

I do hope you're not percieving the contense of this recording as 'the facts', because basicly all it does is persuing an opinion based on 'mainstream' knowledge advocated by those who have projected it as 'truth' . Sure, on the surface it may all seem true as so many follow this point of view. But as soon one starts to dig deeper in these so called truth, it quickly starts to fall apart as a house of cards. Many other 'facts' have deliberately bin altered, obscured, hidden from public (mainstream) view. And so the original projected argument portraited as truth is merely a mask, put in place in order to fool the masses. To get them on board to a belief system that seems 'good' . Where have we seen that before ... Everybody wants to live a good and healthy live, right ? Sure, yet the manner of this perception is different for every one. Some belief it is their right to withhold evidence that proofs an evil agenda for their own benefit. Some belief it is a good thing to give away their power to those that will abuse you in order to feel 'safe' . Some belief they are born to 'save' all victims from the abused . All belief ... Here i just presented the victim-perpetrator-saviour triangle of drama. I agree with you that many live in denial and each case individually is unique towards what it contains. But to stick at the subject at hand, it comes down to what you are able to percieve to enrich your 'truth' assesment, to enlarge your awareness. As earth is a living entity that provides a playing ground for all creatures living upon it, it allowes ALL of its 'children' to explore the game of life through experience (ex-peer-science). So now we find our selves in a situation where the natural balance of the planet is so tampered with, that danger lurks behind the corner. That is the time we, as a species, can grow in big leaps, in terms of awareness. That requires deep investigation. It is my experience that we are being led, and have bin led for many centuries by lies and deception. The natural process of life and growth is ever lasting change. So is it for every being in the universe. The reason for 'global warming' is the change of the sun, wich follows through with the change in its solarsystem, to earth and all its creatures. It is all acting and re-acting towards movement towards ever lasting changes in Balance. Those in the know and unrightfully in power play a dirty game in order to keep that power through any means at their disposel. It has long bin proven Weather wars is one of those means in their possession. (along with many other means) They provide tall tales to those not in the know and keep them that way. They're oppertunists, they're smart, they are powerfull ... but only because they choose to misuse the innocense (in-no-sense) for their own 'truth' ... as so they belief ... So now i've given you something to chew on. I've put a link down in an other comment somewhere along this list if you care to investigate. Check it if you have the interest you claim to have. You might find yrself intrigued with this top of the iceberg. Take care & maybe shi(f)t happens.

If any of you were genuinely concerned about a climate crisis, you would seek all of the possible causes, data, and knowledge in well documented research. You would properly use the internet and libraries in your search for articles containing undeniable knowledge to serve as a foundation for your opinions. That is only step 1; until you have done that, you can't even start to draw a theory for causality in climate change and better yet, WITHOUT the above, do you realize that one cant even begin to create credible solutions or plans of action that aren't pure wish-wash acts of fantasy based in superstition? Fantasy courses of action that serve as the equivalent of shaking a stick and inhaling smoke in the hopes of curing typhus. So until you, citizen, have done the above, don't tell me which way to cast my vote, don't tell me which product to buy and don't sign me up. Because believe it or not that is how the problem gets worse.	UCL8uaWEu3Cqr_ueJ7nQZmUQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL8uaWEu3Cqr_ueJ7nQZmUQ	1	Ugj17pulGOex8XgCoAEC	Patrick Burke Clason

Even if humans are impacting climate change at all, it&#39;s a natural process that the earth will go through whether we tax the hell out of ourselves or not. It&#39;s extremely naive to believe that the planet will always be in the same state that we experience it in at this present time. In the long-term, the planet will be just fine. The worst thing to happen to earth is human existence. The sooner we become extinct, the better it will be for the planet and it&#39;s animal inhabitants. People believe the myth that we have the power to win over mother nature and this is just laughably ignorant. If you want to champion a worthy cause, stop reproducing and spreading STDs. People can&#39;t even do that successfully, even when they can&#39;t take care of the offspring that they already have. You really think we can unite and win over climate change. Ha! Go earth!

It has the potential to harm the Earth much more than a statistically insignificant mean global temperature increase over 30 years! But because a bunch of Hollywood know it all hipsters and politicians (whom probably couldn&#39;t pass a high school level science class) are going Chicken Little over climate change you all act like life on Earth is going to be extinct if we don&#39;t start shuttering all coal fired power plants now! GIVE ME A BREAK! Read up on Fukushima if you don&#39;t believe me on the seriousness of this situation. One reactor core they cannot find which means it probably melted down. The world&#39;s efforts should be to help with the cleanup as one more major earthquake could jeopardize the cooling of the fuel rods and we could potentially have a global life threatening release of radiation.

And while the energy industry funds both sides of the climate debate, the government/foundation monies go only toward research that advances the warming regulatory agenda. With a clear public-policy outcome in mind, the government/foundation gravy train is a much greater threat to scientific integrity.

This snorlax hasn't done his research and is just sending terror down people's minds (he got 96 likes). Deforestation has been reduced everywhere except in Indonesia according to The Economist. Secondly: 'man will realize that he can't eat money'. Not only is this irrelevant, but extremely stereotypical and excessively negative. What will blaming our humanity achieve. It's so unproductive and useless to my mind. Money is just a system that makes things run smoothly. It is the foundation of our lives, and we cannot deny that everyone needs money to survive, so we can't exactly blame people that think money is important - of course it is! Thirdly: 'Fight for Earth'. Who are we fighting? I know that this is a metaphorical phrase, but seriously, what are we against? Who's the enemy? The climate? We can't stop nature from doing its thing. This line is, again, using emotional language and not putting forward a solution. And if you don't have a solution, mr snorlax, then don't comment. Fourthly: 'Rich and pompous douchebags rule our country and it's starting to show'. I don't know how it is in America, but here in the UK and most of the world, leaders are actually paid around 100k per year for what they do. That is certainly well off, but rich is an overstatement. Additionally, Snorlax over here is being irrelevant - what is being rich got to do with global warming? Also - 'starting to show'... What?! This snorlax is pissing me off, seriously, leaders in the Victorian times and earlier, and monarchs were SO MUCH more richer than leaders of today's world. So in conclusion, as this is a typical comment from youtube, I am not criticising just Snorlax, but most of the misled sheep that are regurgitating their favourite demagogue's ideas and scaring people to death, especially children. I remember watching a geography documentary in Year 7, and I will not deny that it was extremely convincing. But I realise how exaggerated it all was.

But since you asked nicely I will answer the same. Straight off Google: "cli¬∑mate Ààklƒ´mit/ noun the weather conditions prevailing in an area in general or over a long period." "weath¬∑er ÀàweTÕüH…ôr/ noun the state of the atmosphere at a place and time as regards heat, dryness, sunshine, wind, rain, etc." So, climate is long-term, weather is short-term. They influence each other, but are not the same. Over a period of years, a climate may change, but someone living in that area may not notice it as the weather changes are so subtle they are not noticeable day-by-day. This is worsened when an individual/family moves around a lot, as many Americans do. We may never realize how out-of-whack the climate is where we are if we don't have a historical reference. Ex: Here in Tampa, many people used to grow mangoes and other tropical fruits. Global Climate Change has caused the summers to become drier, with rain no longer coming almost every day, and arctic fronts now dip down this far South due to changes in the Jet Stream. So it's now both hotter in the Summer and colder in the Winter. This is happening in many places, confusing those who learned the term "Global Warming". I prefer "Global Weirding" as one writer called it. OK. Hope this make it clearer...	UC_1a6FHmM-nXoFtV2b1Ti9g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_1a6FHmM-nXoFtV2b1Ti9g	1	UggfdzFyv60qY3gCoAEC	Snorlax

Never trust a soul whose paycheck starts with any government approved budget. Yes churchy stuff is myth, so is "sciencey" stuff. The past is always steeped in mythology, no matter who tells the great stories,. Real science is about the ability to accurately predict future outcomes, not to certify which mythologies are real and which are fake; they are all fake to one degree or another. I don't "know" if evolution is true, but neither do I doubt it. Who cares? Maybe Orwell had something when he said: "Who controls the past, controls the the future. Who controls the present controls the past." I think he captured the reason people like you argue and fight over over which meaningless mythologies need to be regarded as "true" Lose the biosphere??? I'm sure it will happen one day but in nature death, change, and renewal is the only constant. Nothing is or ever was "sustainable"; now there is one helluva myth I'm not worried about putting more CO2 fertilizer in the oceans, ground, or air.

It is man's attempt to understand physics which is made from God, who made us through evolution (as we see it) necessary to be closer to Him by being able to understanding his physics. Churchy stuff is all a myth and although helped to create moral consciousness in the last millenniums, causes problems in our evolutionary progress from this point on. Everyone knows evolution is the truth, and so, use that as an excuse to ditch compassion in this still dog eat dog world. Thus ditching breads chaos. We lose science and God as we lose the biosphere!

I wonder if there's even a whole one million radicalized (not to contain their holy wars). I'm sure the number of "radicalized Christians" is less, however, to prove a point, both these religions have caused a lot of blood spilling in the way past. Thankfully, Jesus puts a container on the would be future holy wars for Christianity. So, there's no excuse for Christians. Still, there will be a rouge Christian which will kill the sinful (like at abortion clinics). Ironically, they both come from the same roots, I believe, that of the Hebrew texts. They both believe in One God, too (like the creator of whatever caused the big bang?).

We know that we are contributing a lot of CO2 into the atmosphere as concentrations are no longer in equilibrium, (the amount being taken in by oceans and plants etc. Again, other atmospheric gases do not dilute this amount of CO2 so the volume of the atmosphere is irrelevant. You are looking at one side of the statistics. What if I told you, since the industrial revolution, carbon dioxide levels have increased by 150%? Why do you think the percentage of man made carbon dioxide in the WHOLE atmosphere matters? It is not important.

Also, there's more that the oceans and vegetation absorbed.¬† However, I did some rough math on it about a year ago: One ton of CO2 occupies 556.2 cubic meters of volume. A cube which all sides measures 8.23 meters or 27 feet. Each person on Earth by direct and indirect means converted oxygen and hydrocarbons into 5.14 of these cubes in 2014 (most people, much less and Americans, much more).¬† That's over 37,000,000,000 tons in 2014 alone.¬† Which equals about 20 trillion cubic meters per year.¬† Earths surface area is 510 million square kilometers times 1,000,000 (meters in a sq km) = 510 trillion square meters. View this as one meter high to visualize the next step.¬† 510 trillion / 20 trillion = 25.5, meaning that the CO2 blanket from just one recent year of emissions is1/25.5 of a meter high, or 39mm or about 1.54 inches.¬† To find the total accumulation since the beginning of the industrial revolution, we will have to exrapolate using known values. In 2014, hydrocarbons and deforestation accounted for 37 gigatonnes of excess CO2 and that amount has increased the Parts Per Million CO2 from exactly 397.83 to 399.85. Deforestation accounts for less than 10% of that.¬† Thus 2.02 ppm CO2 = about 37 GT. At the beginning of the industrial revolution, the ppm was (slightly less than) 280.¬† 400 ppm minus 280 = 120.¬† 120 divided by 2.02 equals 59.4. Thus, 59.4 multiples of 37 equals the total humanity has emitted into the biosphere.¬† That is 2.2 trillion tons of excess CO2.¬† 2200 / 35 (billion tons from just the year 2013) = 59.4.¬† 59.4 x 39mm =¬† about 2,320 mm or 92 inches extra.¬† EDIT: I think it was more like 31 billion, not 37, thus I want to say about 77 inches extra. It's not much but is still 40% MORE than just 200 years ago. I don't think any "natural" event short of a big meteor could do that so fast.

Remember, back in the "old days" when dinosaurs roamed, this was a completely different planet, that is, different continents, ocean currents and even a slightly different star!

Science is NOT political party divisions (but you people seem to be). One piece of evidence does NOT disprove a theory (Relativity does not disproved newton's). OMG, the temp raised 1/2 degree in a hundred years - to say that is "nothing" is to say "nothing" about geological timescales (at that rate, the planet would be toast in but a very small geo time scale). Variations DO exist (and some of them are humans espousing excess CO2, causing a scientifically proven "some amount" of extra warming).¬† Nobody can deny that CO2 is an infrared absorber, and that even though the atmosphere is already somewhat opaque to infrared, additional inputs WILL cause (at least some amount of additional) heating. Now, for the fun part - getting INDUSTRIAL about global powerlines, batteries made cheaply via machine automation and, of course, the same with solar, since solar IS the number one potential source (for the time being). I have to say that the skeptics (not deniers) have got a VERY important part of this equation correct - that of not allowing LIMITATION to become politically structured into our everyday lives. In fact, without the "support" of the skeptics, we might indeed lose our future to rats. Some might argue that we "need" the world elite to limit our co2 emissions but that would MAKE THINGS WORSE, much worse. Why? Because there would not be enough energy available to grow a decent and HEALTHY planetary civilization needed to go on to bigger and better "things" (and ONLY which could ever have the power to fix global warming should it really become out of control). "Believers"... You now had better understand WHY the skeptics "deny" (not because they might belong to one side of a political party). They question the politics rightly so! Anyhow, what's the big deal - global warming has been brought to all of us via the structure of the universe, so that we might transition from fossil fuels - and learn fusion... and go to space in our graphene ships ;)	UCOZHBPIAxydNQOAc07jJVEA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOZHBPIAxydNQOAc07jJVEA	1	UgjwF_YmtoUu2XgCoAEC	Emperor Shaddam IV

The only way they bring them inline is by cheating: changing the starting point in retrospect. Your understanding of the connection between solar activity and climate is outdated. We're not talking about direct insolation. We're talking about indirect effects, with delays built in. After all, even the CO2-climate effect is indirect. There's a lot of evidence suggesting that CO2 changes are mostly a result of climate change rather than a cause. If the planet warms for other reasons, CO2 is released; if it cools, CO2 is stored (in tundra, oceans, etc.) Warming does NOT directly follow increased greenhouse gas. How do you explain the cooling in the 1970's, or the fact that most of the warming took place before CO2 increased much? The correlation is actually quite poor.

As an engineer I can tell you that the TV set you find so simple (just turn it on on watch the idiots perform) is actually pretty complex and you could not even begin to understand how it works but on the other hand your TV set is mere child's play compared with the Earth's climate systems which are billions of times more complex. In fact weather is so complex it cannot be predicted beyond a few days of guessing. I will grant you that to a simpleton all things are simple....that's why we call them simpletons and not natural philosophers.

UgjwF_YmtoUu2XgCoAEC.876AJRwsb1F87GPFGoQOzz		1	2015-12-02 15:56:52	Mr Pete	+Daniel Ivanov (I'm glad you enjoyed commenting on a software bug ... I wasn't the one who carefully transformed quotes into garbage :) ) Getting back to something real: do you realize that some kinds of results DO immediately indicate than an initial hypothesis is incorrect? For example, if we hypothesize a simple direct relationship between two effects, any (properly done) data set that shows a lack of correlation is a disproof of the direct relationship. Thus, for example, the fact that CO2 has increased monotonically for a very long time, but long term temperatures go up and down, tells us that there's not a simple relationship. In fact, here's something very few people seem to understand: finding a correlation NEVER proves nor even implies a cause-effect relationship between those two trends. I hope you also realize that the number of people who like or dislike something... or the number of scientists who agree with something, has absolutely no bearing on whether that something is correct. Science has a very long history of getting things horribly wrong. And it only takes ONE person, ONE different perspective, to tear down an entire theory about How Things Work. In my lifetime, my best friend in high school had an uncle who was laughed at for trying to get data published demonstrating continental drift aka plate tectonics. Yet only a few decades later, the previous models are completely tossed in the trash and his perspective is fully accepted. I wouldn't say "global warming" is a myth... of course our planet has warmed (and cooled) at various times. But to discover if we are wrecking the climate, we need to ask more than "is it warming today in correlation with CO2 increase." More important is this question: "is this warming unusual" -- ie are we seeing something that we've done, or that simply happens naturally? YES, CO2 has some effect on climate. But how big is it? One major dumb thing about how the research is being done today: VERY little investment into how natural climate variation works. We're hardly asking the questions. If you don't ask the questions, you don't get answers. And the second major mistake about research today: too much incredibly poor practice. This is a huge, complex issue, requiring great input and insight from a wide variety of fields. Yet (for example) the best statisticians are hardly consulted at all for what is a vastly statistical issue. Those with expertise in physics are hardly consulted for the models. People playing with data sets regularly ignore the insights of those who collected the data (how else to explain the occasional "upside down" use of data: data that means "less" is "lower temp" is flipped as if "more" is "lower temp"... and even when called on it, the error is not corrected!) To understand the more important question, we have to look at evidence that's ignored by those who only look for human factors. Two of the more interesting long-term evidences I've seen: arctic treeline, and glaciers in the alps. Arctic treeline (how far north do trees grow) don't change quickly. So if we see treelines moving south it indicates long term cooling. Treelines moving north indicates long term warming. Guess what: arctic treelines were MUCH further north than today, less than two thousand years ago. I.e., it was a lot warmer and not that long ago. I don't have time to write more. You can do your own digging!	UC2VqvmmKMGVT6K8cmOBzx3Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2VqvmmKMGVT6K8cmOBzx3Q	1	UgjwF_YmtoUu2XgCoAEC	Emperor Shaddam IV

Forget what "climate scientists" say because their very livelihood is predicated on grants and foundation money given because of their hype. Of COURSE climate changes... duh! It's called WEATHER! From August to December for thousands and thousands of years the AVERAGE temperature swing is about 58 degrees! Got it? And "climate scientists" want you to freak out over a 0.75 degree increase in that average over the last 130 years??? Seriously? You find what the PERCENTAGE of man-caused carbon we put into the atmosphere as it relates to the entire amount of atmosphere of the planet and you'll have a little perspective as to why so many just don't buy into this rhetoric.

"Parkinson said that the fact that some areas of the Southern Ocean are cooling and producing more sea ice does not disprove a warming climate. ""Climate does not change uniformly: The Earth is very large and the expectation definitely would be that there would be different changes in different regions of the world,‚Äù Parkinson said. "That's true even if overall the system is warming.‚Äù Another recent NASA study showed that Antarctic sea ice slightly thinned from 2003 to 2008, but increases in the extent of the ice balanced the loss in thickness and led to an overall volume gain."

Let me explain something to you, though I sincerely doubt you are intelligent enough to even understand what I say. But maybe someone else might read it and understand, even when you are very very likely far far too far gone. The scientific evidence supporting AGW is very robust. No thinking person has presented even close to enough evidence to refute AGW. If you are a thinking person, you can't either. However, you seem to be caught up in the politics of AGW. Well the politics of AGW has nothing to do with the fact AGW both exists, and is quantifiable RIGHT NOW. Where politics does come into play is what we do about AGW. Mitigation is a political issue. In this way yes, our leaders have failed us. Mitigation has been "co-opted"; by many groups, including one section of the "global elite". So that part you are correct about. A thinking person would reject the co-opting by the "global elite"; but put forth an alternative mitigation proposal. Denial is as foolish as the proverbial ostrich with its head in the sand.

Once the error was fixed, the program was run again and still showed climate change was occurring. Since then, the program's projections have been found to be highly accurate. Also, the 'amplified indirect impact of solar storms on earth's climate' only tells part of the story. We are still warming when solar activity would normally be causing cooling. In fact, warming directly follows along with the increased amount of greenhouse gases (mostly CO2 and methane) in the atmosphere.

It literally means that scientists have figured out that solar activity affects Earth's climate. That in no way makes Global Warming a myth. The two are mutually exclusive. I have not seen the latest research into this so correct me if I'm wrong, but I assume that the study says it cannot draw a correlation between this and global warming trends since the Industrial Revolution?

I didn't say "solar activity" did I. It's more complex than direct effect of solar activity. It's an *indirect* effect. In over-simplified form: solar storms, as measured in solar cycles and sunspots, affect cosmic rays... which affect cloud formation on earth... which affects climate greatly. (I'm currently getting caught up on the absolute latest... this is WAY more complex than I thought as well... here's an even more simplified form that seems to reflect what little they have confidence in: something "out there" affects cloud formation, which has a great impact on climate. :) ) Here's a hint on my question above: it's not (represented in the models)...

I agree we should look at both sides. So why doesn't the IPCC examine natural sources at all? (It doesn't!)

If you, yourself, conduct an experiment with large glass containers with air, methane, and carbon dioxide and record the temperatures you can actually debunk Bill Nyes and Al Gores experiment and you will see for yourself that carbon dioxide has an insignificant impact on the atmosphere and anything to global warming. You should also realize that the trend has been going down for the last 7 years regarding global temperatures. Also look up hockey stick graphs.

We are in the 21st century and we are completely dependent on non-renewable resources. Our over dependency on this will start wars when it gets to critically low levels. <br />Here are a few points i&#39;d like to add:<br />1: Oil is a very profitable resource and provides a lot of capitol to the country that that owns it. Greed is restricting our advancement into better lifestyles that are self sustaining and much cleaner.<br />2: Which brings me to my second point - Look at china, pollution there has got so bad that it is affecting the health of millions - to the point where people wear face masks to avoid it. It is clear what the contributor to this pollution is but nothing is being done to clean or lower the amount of pollution in the air.<br />3: Finally, renewable resources are actually becoming more efficient in the generation of power with an efficiency rating of 42% on solar panels currently which will only increase as more research is conducted. Think of that for a second - Harnessing 42% of the suns energy that it transmitted to those panels. That is a lot of energy.<br />Our over dependence and over reliance attributed by greed and corruption is what it preventing us from progressing to our utmost capabilities. Our developments should be for long term betterment of human life- not for short terms monetary gains.	UCN9F0GH5CZ1SQTxjCqd-x7g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN9F0GH5CZ1SQTxjCqd-x7g	0

The difference between human and others is only in our ability to do it. All other animals/plants just can't do it because of their restrictions (other animals/plants or small resources).

Now last i checked, if one figure says one thing, then how could another figure which suggests the opposite also be true. This isnt superposition, they dont happen simultaneously. People who agree global warming is increasing more rapidly due to humans give facts and figures, and then those who DONT think global warming is increasing more rapidly due to humans ALSO give facts and figures but...then that contradicts the former...so...one of them are not true facts and figures. So while y&#39;all are fighting about which one is a hoax without looking at it through a lens that isnt black and white, i was just here wondering if any of you knew which statistic is actually correct and isnt made-up, incorrect, rubbish to make you sound intelligent, etc. Because once you deduce the facts and figures that are actually the CORRECT one...then these little arguments about who does what in global warming will all disappeeeeear. At least i thought, do your research...and you can know RIGHT NOW which is the correct one, the TRUE facts and figures. Really, this isnt rocket science. I wont tell you because i dont want to get involved with arguments involving if i think we contribute to global warming or not. Because on BOTH sides it is like talking to a brick wall, the brick wall being the truth. But once you look through a lens at a different angle and take your time to do your research, then you can sit back in some form of comfort knowing that you know the statistics and the people fighting on youtube or wherever, are wasting their time...

Luntz (born February 23, 1962) is an American political consultant,[2] pollster, and "public opinion guru"[3] best known for developing talking points and other messaging for various Republican causes. His work has included assistance with messaging for Newt Gingrich's Contract with America, promotion of the terms death tax instead of estate tax and climate change instead of global warming, and public relations support for pro-Israel policies in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict." Here in the UK, we are measuring and we have had extremes in heat (e.g. less frost in winter than 10 years ago), in cold (e.g. 2010 winter) in rainfall (e.g. Flooding in Somerset Levels) and storminess (e.g. See Dawlish railway line wrecked). Global warming IS happening and as heat to becoming become trapped near the surface and in the oceans, this is causing more frequent extremes of weather, plus shifts in well-recognised climate zones.

I¬¥m not saying that we should polute even more, but we shouldn¬¥t be so concerned as we are right now.<br /><br />Before I start getting hated on, I defend that we should polute less to avoid what is happening, but we can¬¥t see every single change as our fault, as something we did wrong. Earth is a complex system and what is going on can be just a part of it¬¥s development.<br /><br />To sum up, we need to pay attention to what is going on in Earth, but we can¬¥t believe that we are the ones that controle Earth, we are just another product of Earth.

So yes, 600,000 years ago we were in the same ice age (quarternary glaciation) which we have been "coming out of" (interglacial period), since ~9700 BC (11.7K years ago). Geologic time is difficult for human brains to fully grasp. What was the point you were trying to make? What part of @stefano agresti 's comment were you questioning? Ice at the poles only indicates we have not yet reached the "greenhouse" earth stage, which the earth hasn't seen since 34 Myr (first bipedal hominids appeared ~4 Myr)... Consider that when the earth reaches its "greenhouse" state (no ice at the poles), the average sea surface temperatures range from 0-28 degrees Celsius. At these temperatures modern civilization will¬† not be able to sustain itself, and it's questionable whether modern humans could survive.

The evidence indicates: the climate is changing towards an earth no humanoid species has survived on before. Do you think we're likely to survive this change? If the earth is evolving to where it wants to be, are you okay with that earth being unable to support humans or many of the species which currently reside here? If we can take responsibility for the minor thermal forcing which humans provided, but which tipped the balances to a level unsuitable for maintaining a human habitat... then we can alter our infrastructure enough to help the earth's natural systems recover from our momentary mistake in unwise utilization of nonrenewable resources. I'd suggest you look into permaculture, a sustainable infrastructure design system which is based on learning from and mimicking nature and her systems. You might find it resonates with you. It's likely to be highly useful as we divest from fossil fuels.

Look it up but here&#39;s the brief. Cattle farming takes up water, burns down rain forests, and cow farts emit methane which causes much more planet warming that does CO2.<br /><br />Also, wind energy is a poor source of energy. Try propelling a car or flying a plane on wind energy. Windmills are the biggest scam. Let&#39;s nor forget about all the disposal issues we&#39;ll have when everyone is driving around on electrical cars. <br /><br />Gas fueled engines have come a long way. Coal is indeed a problem, but it is only burned so you can have electricity, so think about that the next time you want everything to run on electricity.

You are a lengend in your own mind: From Wiki a synopsis of Hitlers "Christianity" The religious views of Adolf Hitler are a matter of debate. According to Alan Bullock, Hitler was a rationalist and a materialist "who believed neither in God nor in conscience."[1] Nonetheless, Hitler opportunistically employed the language of 'divine providence,' in defence of his own myth.[2] Hitler was baptised and confirmed a Catholic in his youth, and raised by an anti-clerical father and practising Catholic mother. In adulthood, he became disdainful of Christianity, but retained some respect for the organisational power of the Church, and though he was prepared to delay clashes out of political considerations, according to Kershaw, Bullock, Evans, Fest, Phayer, Shirer and others, he eventually hoped to eradicate Christianity in Germany.[3] Prosecutors at the Nuremberg Trials submitted that Hitler engaged in a slow and cautious policy to eliminate Christianity.[4] Historians such as Fischel and Dill have written that if the regime could not eradicate Christianity, it hoped instead to subjugate or distort it to a Nazi world view. Steigmann-Gall interprets Hitler's language to mean that Hitler held Jesus in high esteem as an "Aryan fighter" who struggled against Jewry, but notes that, over time, his Nazi movement became "increasingly hostile to the churches".[5] According to Kershaw, Hitler was "a very private, even secretive individual", able to deceive "even hardened critics" as to his true beliefs. His anti-Christian world view is evidenced in sources such as the Goebbels Diaries, the memoirs of Albert Speer, and the transcripts edited by Martin Bormann in Hitler's Table Talk. The historian Evans wrote that Hitler repeatedly called Nazism a secular ideology founded on science, which in the long run could not co-exist with religion. Goebbels wrote in 1941 that Hitler "hates Christianity".[6] Speer wrote after the war that Hitler had "no real attachment" to Catholicism, but that he never formally left the Church. Rees concludes that "Hitler's relationship in public to Christianity‚Äîindeed his relationship to religion in general‚Äîwas opportunistic. There is no evidence that Hitler himself, in his personal life, ever expressed any individual belief in the basic tenets of the Christian church".[7] Although skeptical of religion, Hitler referred to belief in a "creator" and sometimes Christianity in speeches. Given his hostility to Christianity, Rees wrote, "[t]he most persuasive explanation of these statements is that Hitler, as a politician, simply recognised the practical reality of the world he inhabited.

Only through a re-integration of humanity into the whole of nature can our people be made stronger. That is the fundamental point of the biological tasks of our age. Humankind alone is no longer the focus of thought, but rather life as a whole . . . This striving toward connectedness with the totality of life, with nature itself, a nature into which we are born, this is the deepest meaning and the true essence of National Socialist thought."

The point of the post was, in a nut shell, CO2. It aint Au, but try living without it. Not sure if What I attempted to post yesterday made it to the monitors of the world. So, I'm going to try too, briefly, give you two points that SHOULD, if there's anything left of YOU,inside your skull, make you rethink, the magnitude of mans involvement with the change of climate, and the amount of time it takes to do it. Point One. Pre-Industrial, massive infusions of CO2 were not only a reality, but in fact, were common. In what is now the western United states especially, lightening used to start fires that would sometime encompass huge tracts (state sized for reference) of land releasing in days, more CO2 than is emitted, by every fossil fuel burning power plant in the U.S,.at full production, for a year. Point Two.This may be another one of those inconvenient facts, that mainstream "science" has neglected to consider, and perhaps today is buried in the basement of the Smithsonian. But it is a fact, and indeed was once common knowledge. Wooly Mammoths, have been discovered, that had flowers in full bloom, with green leaves,in their mouths, when they died!! They were eating in fields of lush vegetation,without a care in the world (as far as can be told by CSI) ¬†when an ice storm of Biblical proportions hit, buried them, and they froze to death in a matter of minutes! Now, what was that you were saying about the gravity of the Industrial Revolution on the Climate?, And for whatever reason, (I'm sure there is some BS reason but that not withstanding.) there has been at least one instance when climate change didn't take nature a full day Of course, it's kind of like those ruins, at 12,000 feet, called Puma Puku. It totally makes a lie of the politically correct narrative of history, and "evolution"and consequently, is ignored. The two facts I presented seem to have been over looked ¬†by Greenhouse Gas Consortium. ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†¬†	UCQ6y5QbqrgLYAwgZ7xVJMWA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ6y5QbqrgLYAwgZ7xVJMWA	1	UggLfnBxphCEtHgCoAEC	DrugsAreBad Mkay?

And FYI, carbon is the base of our DNA, but that doesn't mean we have CO2 anywhere in there. It just means that we have complex molecules in our body composed of Carbon Bases that determine our traits. But go on.... Tell me about how CO2 is the most awesome gas in the universe.

UggLfnBxphCEtHgCoAEC.8762ynt-kAC87jxFIPJNBJ		0	2015-12-14 12:39:55	Bruce Frykman	+Daniel Ivanov¬† When did CO2 (the food base of all life on Earth) turn into the Satan gas from hell? ¬† CO2 levels have been 20 times higher than today with absolutely no discernible influence on temperature. It's been both cooler with higher CO2 levels and much warmer with lower CO2 levels. The reason it is a trace gas is that all life is literally starving for it and it gobbles it up literally as fast as it is created.¬† Its the sun that energizes this process and gives us food from carbon. We are carbon life forms. We get all our carbon only from CO2 based food since we are not designed to eat coal for our carbon. In the oceans more CO2 simply means more sea life of all kinds, on the surface its more trees, healthier trees, better more drought resistant crops and more plant and animal life for us all to eat. If you are into death cults then you can call the gift of life the Satan gas from hell, just don't expect those of un-corrupted by government propaganda to join you	UC0jDJqdKsB-slq_NVEDRSbA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0jDJqdKsB-slq_NVEDRSbA	1	UggLfnBxphCEtHgCoAEC	DrugsAreBad Mkay?

These huge animals, had been standing in what had to of been a warm meadow,grazing, without a care in the world, when in the space of a few minutes, they were entombed in ice, where they remained until the last century. I'm assuming, that factoid has gone the way of other archaeological inconvenient facts. If it wasn't for people like Erich Von Daniken, for instance,with the money to finance exploration and to publish information about places like Puma Puku and other places and relics that absolutely do not fit the mainstream narrative of history,then those that wish to manipulate the minds of the simple for the furtherance of their own agenda's,would go unchecked. Call them conspiracy theories or whatever you choose, the act of denying reality because it doesn't fit the party line, is stupid, and history is filled with examples of tyrants of every stripe, BSing those they control, OR are attempting to control. The REASON for climate change is just one more example of it.	UCQ6y5QbqrgLYAwgZ7xVJMWA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ6y5QbqrgLYAwgZ7xVJMWA	1	UggLfnBxphCEtHgCoAEC	DrugsAreBad Mkay?

The Earth is in a cycle of cooling and warming yes. That has nothing to do with greenhouse gasses however. It has in fact been doing this for the past 4 and a half billion years. Only since the start of the Industrial Revolution have temperature average globally skyrocketed as fast as they did. This is the same process as what happened on Venus (or rather what we think. We don't actually know for sure.), only this is a direct result of human action. And FYI if the laws of thermodynamics were "Repealed" everything would immediately cease to move and would never move again. It's called Entropy. Anyways, take from my rant what you will. You seem more reasonable in your thinking than a lot of other people (believe it or not, there are actually people that say that the Earth's temperature isn't changing and has never changed) so I do hope I've at least mildly swayed the way you see the world. If not then it's honestly not a problem either. I believe people have a right to believe what they want to believe and nobody should be able to outright make them change their mind. A bit of persuasion never hurts though. So TL:DR- Yes the Earth has undergone extreme periods of global cooling and warming, and there are indeed parts of the world that are currently getting cooler, but according to the fossil record never before in the history of our fine planet have temperature averages changed this rapidly. Weather that implies humans did it or not is up to you, but this change started near the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. Think of that what you will.

Nobody, anywhere,refutes the idea that the earth is getting a little warmer. Certainly certain parts have. It.s not a new phenomena. It has had periods of ice at least as far south as New Jersey, and tropics, as far north as Canada if the fossil record is to be believed.. Smart people have known this fact for quite sometime. It was doing it before coal was ever burned for electricity, or gas burned in cars. If all known laws of physics, and thermodynamics are suddenly repealed, and an equivalent alternative suddenly becomes available, the earth will still do what it has always done, until some power much greater than puny men or the earth itself, acts upon it	UCQ6y5QbqrgLYAwgZ7xVJMWA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ6y5QbqrgLYAwgZ7xVJMWA	1	UggLfnBxphCEtHgCoAEC	DrugsAreBad Mkay?

I have personally spoken to authors of papers on global warming. It's certainly not a myth, and I doubt there's any chance it¬†has somehing to do with the CIA. Though the CIA has been known to research unethical proposals in the past, none have ever even come close to execution. As for you DrugsAreBadMkay?, I agree wholeheartedly with your beliefs, but I cannot agree with your tactics. Insults aren't going to help you win the argument. Either way, it's obvious nothing will come of this. I'd say the argument ends in a firm handshake and a "I believe we're all entitled to an opinion, and I'm not going to try to force mine onto you."

A low IQ doesn't make you a bad person. That's a choice you make. Baselessly attacking someone for their beliefs, that's stupid. To quote a certain Radio Show "I believe reasonable people can disagree reasonably". Calling someone stupid for merely considering the idea that such a document could exist is not reasonable.

Simply turning over our lives to government, the likes of those who are complicit in the bank bailouts, by giving them control over CO2 emission, something we do with every breath, is completely misguided and dangerous.¬† It&#39;s ironic that the production of a natural substance that has literally increased the volume of vegetation over the past century, is attacked as a pollutant by people who call themselves &quot;Green&quot;.¬† Geologic warm periods are those characterized by an abundance of life.¬† It&#39;s insane and stupid to follow computer models that make all kinds of assumptions regarding natural feedback mechanisms into supporting Neanderthal gevernment control measures which will place an incredible amount of power in the hands of a small few.

More and more real scientists are showing it as a manufactured lie that had no good intention. Think for yourself, look at the stories they have been telling! &quot;New York will be under water by 2015&quot;. &quot;The ice caps will be gone by 2000&quot;. &quot;by 1985 air pollution will have reduced the amount of sunlight reaching earth by one half&quot;. &quot;Sixth Mass Extinction by 2000&quot;. In 2007, the chief of the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said, ‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs no action before 2012, that‚Äôs too late. What we do in the next two to three years will determine our future. This is the defining moment.‚Äù It is now almost 2016 and nothing was done before 2012, so, since it is ‚Äútoo late,‚Äù why spend any more time and money fighting global warming?

Global warming is not an output of computer models; it is a conclusion based on observations of a great many global indicators. By far the most straightforward evidence is the actual surface temperature record. While there are places ‚Äî in England, for example ‚Äî that have records going back several centuries, the two major global temperature analyses can only go back around 150 years due to their requirements for both quantity and distribution of temperature recording stations. Personally, I can't believe that there are people walking around DENYING Global Warming.

There is in fact very little proof for the existence of gravity. We can see it's effects, but we have never been able to accurately describe it. The only way to prove that gravity exists as a force, would be to discover the particle responsible for its effects. That has yet to happen. The particle responsible for climate change however; is called humanity.	UCYNj4bd6NY9PVyQeKzTD78Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYNj4bd6NY9PVyQeKzTD78Q	1	Ugi7dCJ52DRCJngCoAEC	Felix Fedre

As I earlier wrote in reply to another comment.

UghFUQINB5InVngCoAEC	0	0	2015-11-28 14:41:04	Stephen Wollman	Unfortunately, in my experience talking to vegans or other environmentally-aware people, I have run into some problems. I will begin by talking about myself first: I have always been very conservative in the way I have viewed our environment. I value human life and comfort more than I do saving the earth. This is a catch 22, since the earth is our physical life support; without it we would not be here. However, when a forest is hewn down to make room for a hospital, which improves human life, I can‚Äôt supply the passion required for the pro-environment debate. I‚Äôll readily admit that it seems like a short-term gain for a long-term loss. Without trees, namely the oxygen they produce, a hospital will help no one. But if we don‚Äôt stop and think about the most good we can do right now, we‚Äôre doomed anyway. While, saving a local ecosystem from biodiversity loss is a noble gesture, if we need a hospital right now, we are faced with the question: ‚Äúwhich of these options is most beneficial to our survival?‚Äù If you were starving to death, finding food would be a priority. If you were then tossed into the ocean, that priority would shift to breathing. The unfortunate nature of my encounter with other activists has leaned heavily on their attitudes. I have become less passionate about my conservative views in recent years; not because of them. An Environmental Science course in which I maintained an A had more to do with it. I‚Äôve seen the ugliness of our environment‚Äôs health decline due to human activity. What I have been unable to justify, concerning the attitudes of others, is their claim to desire a better future. Many people say they want this earth to be here and in good condition for our future generations. They claim genuine concern for a group of people that don‚Äôt exist, and tell people like me (who eat red meat) to ‚Äúdie of heart disease and go to hell.‚Äù - and I quote. Not a fiber of me believes that they are ‚Äúconcerned‚Äù for future generations, who aren‚Äôt even born yet, while they are busy treating those of us who are here, who can actually make that difference, so distastefully. It used to be, people like that made me want to dump my oil change refuse right into the ground. If there is a change we can make--and I believe there is--then we ought to be concerned about winning people. We can‚Äôt be so passionate about our own thoughts and ideas that we are willing to martyr anyone who thinks differently. That will only turn people off to what needs to be done. This video was well made. Yet, starting out with, ‚ÄúI love, I love, I love...‚Äù only proves what these promoters are about: me. Again, here we are, trying to show genuine concern for future generations, while putting ME on a pedestal. I appreciate their happy faces, but I‚Äôm not convinced. I will not be signing the petition.

To think that man has influenced this planet in the 200 yrs since the industrial revolution in such a way to damage the climate is absolutely asinine and shows how out of touch with reality some people truly are. Case and Point, the man who preached about climate change for the last 15 years, flies in a jet fuel burning plane across the world daily. Oh, and apparently he invented the internet single handedly in his sleep while eating a pop-tart. Gimme a frikken break.<br /><br />Let this be a lesson that we aren&#39;t the almighty evolved beings we give ourselves such credit for being. We&#39;re barely done dragging our knuckles and grunting at each other. The quicker people stop letting total idiots have a voice that is somehow taken seriously, the better off we will be.

You are actually getting close to the answer in your own 6th grade thinking way. What you need is to keep thinking about the carbon cycle, and include all of it, including other pools, both active fractions and stable fractions. I'll give you a hint. It starts and ends in the soil. That should point you in the direction of a real mitigation plan Just out of curiosity I will leave it there and see if you can surmise it with your own thought processes..

When there is too much carbon dioxide in the water, it will form carbonic acid to equilibriate and make the water too acidic for crustaceans such as plankton will start dying(mostly at birth during early stages of developement when there shells are weakest) and have a massive affect on the ocean's food web as a whole, as there is no primary food source. So more CO2 is definitely not a good thing, do not forget the affects of acid rain in the NorthEast portion of the US. It is not just warming that we need to worry about, there is more than that.

The earth will warm or cool within the parameters of the moisture in the atmosphere.. The rain or snow also helps to remove the co2 from the atmosphere which is either absorbed by the oceans or plants. 6th grade science! Plants cannot live without co2, the more the better.

It proceeds from the false belief that cutting CO2 emissions will somehow reduce worldwide temperatures. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE THIS WILL HAPPEN! The real agenda here is the transfer of wealth from wealthy nations to poor, so-called &quot;developing&quot; nations. The cutting of CO2 is incidental to the marxist agenda that pushes these bogus climate summits. If these nations come to an &quot;agreement&quot; READ IT CAREFULLY! It will be FILLED with payments from wealthy nations to poor nations! IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH CLIMATE CHANGE!	UCebzzTd1wqJXbTkAnZaqgdg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCebzzTd1wqJXbTkAnZaqgdg	0

Their logical premise that the world‚Äôs weather systems would remain relatively static absent fossil fuel burning is absurd on its face. Global climate change is perpetual. The planet is an organic system in a constant state of transformation by forces far more powerful than human technology.

This isn&#39;t just something perpetrated by politicians and governments. Everyone is to blame but nobody wants to give up their creature comforts or deal with increased costs of living. instead of always politicizing it, maybe Google could actually give us links to resources to show us what sacrifices need to be made each day. there is no magic wand solution, and politicians and companies just want to pay it lip service in order to get certain people into power. we can do far better than that, but it&#39;s gonna hurt a bit. there are no free lunches, but the world&#39;s ecosystem is worth it.

It&#39;s meant to reduce global temperatures, but how? And by what means will this solve the whole of the climate change problem? <br /><br />Clicking the first link in the description (yes, there&#39;s links to data!) it becomes immediately apparent that the biggest problem by far for New York on the climate change front is us plebeians driving cars. Next down the list is us having houses. And then the big grocery stores and malls we love so much. Any bets that the second lowest item on the list, industrialism, is what most people are going to try to make this about? Any best that we&#39;re going to target business as the evil culprit behind it all just so we don&#39;t need to take our own responsibility-- and then complain later that the governments didn&#39;t do enough, when by stopping the emissions of industry but not us the consequences still hit us pretty darn full force?<br /><br />Even granting the implications and issues presented in the other sources presented, and I can grant this, what does this do to prove an arrangement will come into effect which will target us the consumer for our primary impact on the climate rather than industry for their lesser impact on climate? <br /><br />And you know what, too? What&#39;s even better is that they can&#39;t be called out on not including the contents of the deal they want... Because it hasn&#39;t even been made yet! This is just a petition to tell someone else to do something about climate change in which no directions as to what to do are made. This is extremely arbitrary and, given that it&#39;s going to be us plebeians who carry most of the petition weight, if it does anything at all it will be almost unequivocally at the expense of business since climate issues (a reality) have been boycotted by a hardcore leftist agenda (like feminism, sadly). I&#39;m not going to sign onto a petition with an exigence so ambiguous that it&#39;s merely &quot;do something about climate change!&quot; Do what about climate change? &quot;... Something.&quot; Will I like that something? Will that something actually help? &quot;Jump on the bandwagon, dammit! Do as we tell you! We&#39;re important and influential YouTubers and we&#39;ve been had by a political agenda just like Hollywood was so far &#39;had&#39; by the leftists that they outcast Ayn Rand for being a capitalist. There&#39;s obviously no risk of agenda and bias here since we&#39;re all rampant leftists. Right? Right?&quot; Even granting that this video lacks substance because the deal doesn&#39;t even exist yet, the exigence is far too ambiguous. This is like saying &quot;the world will end tomorrow! Sign here and it&#39;ll all be okay!&quot; and not explaining how or even if signing will actually help change the course of events. I don&#39;t like it. Even supposing it influences &quot;the politicians,&quot; those politicians have an agenda to set as either right-wingnuts or communists-but-called-socialists. Even if my signature would influence their decision whether or not to &quot;take action,&quot; that type of action would be deeply imbued in agendas which are utterly absurd and do not pertain to ethical systems let alone to reality.

While I agree Humans have a negative affect on things, your not going to change that with more regulation. the only real cure would be to completely change the lifestyle of all humans back to the way of the native American Indian and I don&#39;t think we are going to do that.<br />The real purpose behind this is to gain more control over the people.

It features a plethora of pretty-faced hipsters all reiterating the same point without expanding upon anything. Perhaps if you kept it to a few people discussing the effects of Global Warming and the prospects of Climate Change (don&#39;t tell us it&#39;s important -- show us it&#39;s important), you might be able to reach more people.

You're referring to regular CO2, which is essential for natural processes, and nature is able to balance it out. However, when we burn fossil fuels, like gasoline and coal, we're releasing rampant CO2 into the atmosphere which is surrounding the Earth and creating a heat trapping blanket. The more rampant CO2 we burn, the thicker this blanket gets, trapping in more heat. This excess in heat is what's causing our climate to change much more rapidly than before, and our ecosystems are not able to adapt fast enough to this change. Overpopulation and deforestation only add to the rampant CO2 in the atmosphere, so they're a contributing factor, not a separate issue. Luckily, with the Climate Summit approaching, we're all able to work together to make big changes to how we use fossil fuels. If our global leaders have our support, we can all work together to protect the planet from future harm.

This causes the carbon cycle to be absolutely messed up and the reduction of carbon, methane and other gases too hard to overcome. Governments are do try many things to reduce the levels of carbon and one is Carbon Capture Storage (CCS), the UK government store the Carbon under the North Sea but only a certain amount can be stored on the sea bed. You mentioned about trees converting energy in the summer YES I understand but you are partially wrong due to the fact that the energy being released from sun has high amounts of radiation and due to the ozone layer being damaged it causes many people disease and the climate to rise making animals to migrate and some organisms to die. So to conclude this conference is very important as means the environmental clauses will change to improve the world and could potentially save many species from extinction and being endangered.

When you look at one volcano can do, or what one solar flare can affect, or what a slight orbit wobble can change, or the effect of an earthquake, the only sensible conclusion is that the human contribution is insignificant. &quot;Global warming&quot; is a con used by politicians to make us all feel guilty, extract tax and turn attention away from their own failings.

These countries will probably only increase their emission because of their greedy corporations and corrupt governments. So if we even reduce our impact as much as possible it will be negated by their output. We should stop trying to push for ever increasing demands here and instead protest the fact of what the eastern countries are not doing.

It¬¥s about getting 100% of our energy from renewable energy by 2050. <br />2. There are other, even more important factors that influence climate change than just energy. For example agriculture: erosion of earth causes desertification and shoots more CO2 in the air than factories. Large scale monocultures would be much more helpful, since they increase erosion a lot. <br />3. Don¬¥t always blame everything on &quot;our leaders&quot;. As an individual, you can do a lot to reduce climate change. If every person alone would do what is in their power to reduce climate change, it would be a lot more helpful than this petition: for example use less electricity and heat, buy local produced goods, buy organic small scale food (meat is ok if it¬¥s free range), reuse graywater, walk more or ride a bike instead of driving your car, and get your energy from renewable energy factories.

We call on you to keep global temperature rise under the unacceptably dangerous level of 2 degrees C, by phasing out carbon pollution to zero. To achieve this, you must urgently forge realistic global, national and local agreements, to rapidly shift our societies and economies to 100% clean energy by 2050. Do this fairly, with support to the most vulnerable among us. Our world is worth saving and now is our moment to act. But to change everything, we need everyone. Join us.&quot; - In this petition there is a children&#39;s naivety.<br />* <br />&quot;Vor einiger Zeit trat ein Wissenschaftler seine j√§hrliche Reise ins russische Nordpolarmeer an, um dort nach toxischen Methangasblasen zu suchen, die aus dem Ozean entweichen. Er hatte zuvor Hunderte dieser Gasblasen gesichtet, jeweils etwa einen Meter breit ‚Äî und das Gas, das sie aussto√üen, ist 50 mal klimasch√§dlicher als CO2. Als er dieses Mal die erste Blase sichtete, war er fassungslos: Sie war einen KILOMETER breit. Eine gewaltige S√§ule aus Gas, die in unsere Atmosph√§re eintrat. Als er weiterfuhr, sah er noch eine, genauso gro√ü, dann noch eine und noch eine. Hunderte davon. <br />Es k√∂nnte genau das sein, wovor Experten gewarnt haben. Durch die Erderw√§rmung entstehen sogenannte &quot;Tipping Points&quot;: Punkte, an denen sich die Erw√§rmung so sehr beschleunigt, dass sie au√üer Kontrolle ger√§t. Durch die Erw√§rmung taut das arktische Meereis und der gigantische wei√üe ‚ÄúSpiegel‚Äù, der die Hitze zur√ºck ins All reflektiert, wird zerst√∂rt. Infolgedessen erhitzen sich die Ozeane, mehr Eis schmilzt, und so geht es immer weiter. Die Situation l√§uft aus dem Ruder. 2014 war extrem ‚Äï es war das hei√üeste Jahr seit Beginn der Aufzeichnungen.<br />Wir K√ñNNEN etwas dagegen tun, wenn wir schnell und mit vereinten Kr√§ften handeln. So k√∂nnen wir dieses Weltuntergangsszenario in eine inspirierende Zukunft f√ºr unsere Kinder und Enkelkinder verwandeln. Eine saubere, umweltfreundliche Zukunft im Einklang mit der Erde, der wir unser Leben verdanken. <br />Der Gipfel in Paris ist die wichtigste Klimakonferenz des Jahrzehnts. Im September 2014 hat unsere Gemeinschaft zur Organisation des People&#39;s Climate March beigetragen und gemeinsam mit anderen Organisationen 700.000 Menschen auf die Stra√üe gebracht, um frischen Wind in die Klimabewegung zu bringen. Am 29. November machen wir es noch einmal, √ºberall auf der Welt. Diesmal ziehen wir es noch gr√∂√üer auf, damit wir unsere Politiker zur Rechenschaft ziehen und sie auffordern, einen sicheren Kurs f√ºr unsere Welt einzuschlagen. Und obendrein m√ºssen wir uns gegen √ñlkonzerne und jeglichen Fatalismus durchsetzen. <br />Wir k√∂nnen gewinnen, wir m√ºssen gewinnen, doch dazu m√ºssen wir beim Gipfeltreffen im Dezember alles geben ‚Äî und brauchen ein paar Euro, Dollar oder Franken zur Unterst√ºtzung unserer Arbeit. Machen wir das jetzt m√∂glich, um die Welt zu schaffen, von der wir tr√§umen.<br />Steuern Sie einen beliebigen Betrag dazu bei.&quot; - In dieser Petition gibt es die Kindernaivit√§t.<br />*<br />&quot;–ú—ã, –æ–±–µ—Å–ø–æ–∫–æ–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –≥—Ä–∞–∂–¥–∞–Ω–µ, –ø—Ä–∏–∑—ã–≤–∞–µ–º –≤–∞—Å –æ–±–µ—Å–ø–µ—á–∏—Ç—å –¥–æ–ª–≥–æ—Å—Ä–æ—á–Ω–æ–µ —Ñ–∏–Ω–∞–Ω—Å–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ (–≤–∫–ª—é—á–∞—è –ø–µ—Ä–∏–æ–¥ –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ 2020 –≥–æ–¥–∞), –Ω–µ–æ–±—Ö–æ–¥–∏–º–æ–µ –¥–ª—è –∑–∞–∫–ª—é—á–µ–Ω–∏—è —Å–∏–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∫–ª–∏–º–∞—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ —Å–æ–≥–ª–∞—à–µ–Ω–∏—è –≤ –ü–∞—Ä–∏–∂–µ, –∏ —Å–æ–±–ª—é–¥–∞—Ç—å —Å–≤–æ–∏ –æ–±–µ—â–∞–Ω–∏—è –æ—Ç–∫–∞–∑–∞—Ç—å—Å—è –æ—Ç —Å—É–±—Å–∏–¥–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è –∏—Å–∫–æ–ø–∞–µ–º—ã—Ö –∏—Å—Ç–æ—á–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤ —ç–Ω–µ—Ä–≥–∏–∏. –ë–æ–ª–µ–µ –±–æ–≥–∞—Ç—ã–µ —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω—ã –¥–æ–ª–∂–Ω—ã –∑–∞—è–≤–∏—Ç—å –æ —Å–≤–æ–µ–π –ø–æ–¥–¥–µ—Ä–∂–∫–µ –±–µ–¥–Ω—ã—Ö –≥–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤, —á—Ç–æ–±—ã —Ç–µ —Å–º–æ–≥–ª–∏ –∏–Ω–≤–µ—Å—Ç–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å –≤ —á–∏—Å—Ç—É—é —ç–Ω–µ—Ä–≥–∏—é –∏ –±–æ—Ä–æ—Ç—å—Å—è —Å –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–∏—è–º–∏ –∏–∑–º–µ–Ω–µ–Ω–∏—è –∫–ª–∏–º–∞—Ç–∞. –í–µ—Å—å –º–∏—Ä –¥–æ–ª–∂–µ–Ω —Å–æ–æ–±—â–∞ —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∞—Ç—å –Ω–∞–¥ –∑–∞–∫–ª—é—á–µ–Ω–∏–µ–º –≥–ª–æ–±–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Å–æ–≥–ª–∞—à–µ–Ω–∏—è –∏ –ø—Ä–µ–∫—Ä–∞—Ç–∏—Ç—å –∫–ª–∏–º–∞—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–µ —Ä–∞–∑—Ä—É—à–µ–Ω–∏–µ, —É–≥—Ä–æ–∂–∞—é—â–µ–µ –≤—Å–µ–º –Ω–∞–º.&quot; - –≤ —Å–µ–π –ø–µ—Ç–∏—Ü–∏–∏ —á—É–≤—Å—Ç–≤—É–µ—Ç—Å—è –∫–∞–∫–∞—è-—Ç–æ –¥–µ—Ç—Å–∫–∞—è –Ω–∞–∏–≤–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å.

Besides Scientists have proven that venus used to be like earth, but because it was closer to the sun it&#39;s climate change period happened a lot faster which is proven that without emissions Earth will also turn into this Emissions will increase the cycle by around a few million years out of billions. You sign this partition and you will lose more rights while others will gain it. Why should the common people lose freedom when industry and some countries will not follow this rule. I know this video is sweet but you already have billionaires who are trying to cut emissions, the Mirai car is now in place and EVERYONE turns off the lights now. We are already on the way to slowing this down, no need for this bullshit I think some government scandal again, Probably America is about to get a Gas crisis again who knows you don&#39;t get told anything these days.

Why sign a damn petition that changes nothing? We want them to rule everything, but that won&#39;t be possible, &#39;cause WE have to start to protect our climate honestly. Yeah, it is not enough to put out the light or to stop showering. People are so blind that they don&#39;t want to see that reducing animal products is the answer. Animal products cause climate change. We waste water, destroy the rain forest and cause greenhouse gases by eating animal products. The soy that is grown on fields of the former rain forest is fed to animals instead giving this food to humans who need it. One cow has to eat up to 16 kilograms of soy until it produces 1 Kilogram of meat. It drinks a lot of water and by eating soy it also eats the water that the soy was irrigated with. Animal products cause a lot of greenhouse gases, more than the worldwide traffic. <br />We shouldn&#39;t start with signing a damn petition. We are powerful as consumers. The first thing that I would do to protect the nature is changing my nutrition.	UCtKj2A2xKuXjymc5z3yqL2g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtKj2A2xKuXjymc5z3yqL2g	0

The earth goes through warming and cooling cycles every 10000 years or so, in 1980 everyone was scared about the ozone layer and the earth getting warmer. Around 2010, people were saying the earth is entering it&#39;s next ice age. Now in 2015 we&#39;re saying it&#39;s getting hotter and worse? The scientests who published these reports are paid millions by companies to find any evidence supporting their claim with any counter evidence. It&#39;s always a different report at some point or another. If you actually studied yourself you&#39;d notice nothing wrong about the earth. Humans have not even existed for a second in earth&#39;s life. We can&#39;t even possibly do that much damage in such a short amount of time. So before you jump on a bandwagon and hype geoup, study for yourself and make your own choices.	UCGi-rIeP-0VSa_0EHvNaibg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGi-rIeP-0VSa_0EHvNaibg	0

The climate has been changing since the beginning of the Earth, long before humans came on the scene, and it will continue to change when we are gone. Pretending our tiny impact on climate (compared to the combined impact of natural greenhouse gases like water vapor, cow farts, volcanoes, and coal seam fires) is going to end the world is not only arrogant, but lethally expensive. Think the only thing that will happen in fighting climate change is that rich people will buy less mega yachets? Think again. Look to our global population before industrialization (which still wasn&#39;t zero emissions). That&#39;s what will happen if we throw out the progress we&#39;ve made. Billions dead. And it will be the poor suffering most from higher food and commodity prices. And it will be you too. Think it your ipad was made and shipped to you without causing any emissions? Think it even CAN be made and shipped to you without causing emissions?	UCSGJXImyYvmTs69Bv4HUbPw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSGJXImyYvmTs69Bv4HUbPw	0

UggXW86wphjhdngCoAEC	0	0	2015-11-28 09:38:07	Admiralhall2000	There is a much much larger threat to human civilization: oil becoming uneconomic to extract ie the energy used to extract it is greater than what the extracted energy provides. There are no substitutes for oil as they all depend on relatively low cost oil to mine their materials, process, manufacture, transport and deploy. Fusion might produce limitless electrical energy but this is not something we can use for mining or heating materials. Oil is used to extract gas and coal. No cheap oil, no cheap alternatives. You cannot build thorium reactors or renewable energy systems using electrical energy. You need portable safe oil for every process from cradle to grave. Biofuels are only economic with cheap oil. Remove that and they become uneconomic. A world with expensive oil has water shortages; no combine harvesters to grow food for 100 billion mouths mid century. Climate change is the number 2 problem. Computers now run the stock markets. Since oil companies have drilled a billion holes and have not found a new major source of oil since 1966 they are investing in expensive tar sand, shale oils and gas. These are false fossil fuel messiahs with no long term prospects making up 2% of the total at most. The computers who future trade will recognise the problem of 2046 in 2035 leading to a massive and unparalled stock market crash. This will precipitate potential nuclear war.

I like this video how we wanne change the world. but it&#39;s not totally up to us. the goverment abuse this to make more money on us. think twice and read stuff before you judge. thats my message	UCMF-kfTMUTNNQ48VLQty-cA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMF-kfTMUTNNQ48VLQty-cA	0

UggSEWJxqmRUpngCoAEC	0	0	2015-11-28 08:49:43	Jacqueline Brunder	James Lovelock who came up with the idea of Gaia where the planet had to be looked as a whole was asked back in the 1980&#39;s whether the threat of global warming, now climate change (because global warming is demonstrably not happening), would mean we should all buy smaller cars etc. He replied of course not as due to the runaway effect of methane production from the northern tundra and the increase in water vapour, both of which are far more effective greenhouse gases than CO2 and there is far more of both, meant it was far too late to do anything about it. He said you may as well buy the biggest car you can and enjoy destroying the place. And I might add that we don&#39;t own this planet the bankers do so anything we do to protect it saves their assets for their children not for ours. They screwed it up, they pauperised us, so let them and their children and children&#39;s children suffer the consequences.

This is NOT science; this is a &quot;partisan political agenda&quot;. (UK Superior Court&#39;s ruling on Gore&#39;s &#39;documentary, when the court banned it from being shown to UK school children) The earth&#39;s climate has always been changing - and it always will! Carbon dioxide is an essential plant food. The more CO2 the faster plants grow. What about the Medieval Warm Period? How about The Little Ice Age? How about the Maunder Minimum? What about the tropical plants found in the Canadian arctic? What about Lord Christopher Monckon&#39;s expose of these fraudsters? What about the BBC&#39;s &#39;The Great Global Warming Swindle&#39;? It&#39;s on Youtube. What about the FACT that there has been NO warming for the past 19 years!!!! What about Climategate, in which global warming promoters were caught red handed conspiring to manipulate the public? What about Michael Mann&#39;s infamous &#39;Hockey Stick&#39;? If anyone reading this hasn&#39;t taken the time to check out these fundamental facts for themselves, then you have whatsoever no right to pontificate on the subject of manmade global warming because you are - simply put - ignorant. Manmade global warming is a fraud. An attempt by the UN to cripple the developed countries by taxing their breath! That&#39;s right. BREATH. Because breath is composed of CO2. Better get yourself up to speed on the facts, here, before you get dragged down the rabbit hole. Who am I? A senior sciences teacher is is fed up to the teeth with the politicization of science.

Why destroy the earth? Is it really worth it? I have seen the natural spaces dwindle in my own life and it is sad to think that humans are being more and more removed from nature. Even if you do not believe in climate change, we still need to respect the Earth. It is our home and it is should remain a beautiful place whether or not you agree that global warming is real or not.

I wonder why conservatives are always the most religious, superstitious, deniers of science and facts, long story short, they&#39;re kinda stupid.

Go to the US Air Force website and find the document &quot;Owning The Weather by 2025&quot;. They have been screwing with nature for decades and are now trying to pass the blame on to climate change/global warming in order to justify the use of stratospheric sulfate aerosols (chemtrails). They are not being used for solar radiation management and carbon dioxide removal (both of which we need) but are used to allow the propagation of radio waves in the atmosphere and for covert warfare purposes. Additionally, they cause harm not resolve it and are responsible for the erratic weather being experienced worldwide.

At that time, barley grew in Greenland, and vine in Stockholm. In Germany, the climate was like in Northern Italy today.<br /><br />So, global warming is something natural.<br /><br />But it hasnt got anything to do with CO2. <br /><br />Else, there would have the global warming we have now already in 1990. Because at that time, we had burnt almost the same amount of coal and mineral oil as today.<br /><br />Would the global warming have something to do with the CO2 in our atmosphere, it wouldnt appear suddenly, but connected with the CO2- production and the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere.

References to this temperature data has been conveniently erased from the AGW propaganda literature - as has the entire medieval warming period. (Look it up) - as has the high temperatures in the late Roman Empire period (Look it up - grape vines being grown in Northern England - very well documented). You&#39;ve all been conned. As Mark Twain so elegantly said &quot;It&#39;s much easier to deceive someone, than it is to convince them that they&#39;ve been deceived&quot;. Well, like it or not, you&#39;ve been deceived. The gurus of &quot;climate change&quot; have spat out some words and you&#39;ve all simply believed them. You haven&#39;t challenged the dogma, yet you fight tooth and nail as if it were a truth that is unassailable. Climate models are so pathetically inadequate, anyone would be crazy to believe them. The met office can&#39;t get the weather right for 7 days time, yet they know - with certainty - what the temperature will be in 100 years. How can you call yourself intelligent and believe this? In any event, they (The Met Office) forecast - in 1998 - that the temperature would continue exponentially rising. It didn&#39;t. It&#39;s stayed level for 17 years and even has subtly dropped. What more proof do you need that your idols have given you false information? Of course, they say &quot;the pause (in temperature rise) will eventually stop&quot; - and you believe that too. This is just religious fanaticism. The earth will warm up to 3600 degrees celsius in approximately 1.2 billion years, due to the earth getting closer to the sun. What are you going to do about that? Time to start building rockets to push the earth back into a stable orbit. Cost will only be a few trillion dollars. If you don&#39;t pay (a lot) more taxes and stop this armageddon, you&#39;re not really an environmentalist, are you? in 4.5 billion years the sun will expand and engulf the earth. Time to spend a few quadrillion dollars to put up some solar shields near the sun, perhaps? Just face it, we are humans. Sad little life forms on the great big blue earth. We can&#39;t do anything except mouth off and look even more ineffectual and pathetic. Climate change is what&#39;s happened for the past 4.5 billion years - and has another 4.5 billions years to go - with or without our intervention. Get on with your lives, stop telling the aves to go back like King Canute. Be nice to neighbours, friends and strangers. That&#39;s enough and it&#39;s a lot more effective than trying to change the earth.	UCyG7pv18tcnrIy1JB9f64IA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyG7pv18tcnrIy1JB9f64IA	0

That&#39;s why socialist governments always want to drop the voting age.<br /><br />As the saying goes:- &quot;If you&#39;re not a left winger before you&#39;re 30, you have no heart. If you are a left winger after 30, you have no brain&quot;.<br /><br />In that video, all those kids passionately believe in what they&#39;re saying. 100 years ago, they&#39;d have been just as passionate about religion. Climate fills the void left by a secular society. Youngsters need to believe in something. Climate has a feelgood factor and championing nature assuages kids&#39; guilt about their privileged social circumstances.<br /><br />You don&#39;t get Ethiopian 20 years olds pushing for carbon footprint reduction. They&#39;re too busy worrying where their next meal is coming from. Hoping against hope that they&#39;ll live to see electricity, electric cookers, &#39;fridges and electric lighting. - Fat chance, with socialists at the helm.<br /><br />Ironic, isn&#39;t it? These privileged youngsters who think they&#39;re doing good are actually campaigning for death and misery of the most vulnerable people on earth (third world victims of the West who don&#39;t want others to benefit from fossil fuels, like Europe did themselves). Kids don&#39;t mean to do this, their childish and callow beliefs mask the harsh realities of life and render them susceptible to predatory and self serving politicians.<br /><br />I&#39;d love to be young again but not if it means being used as a pawn by dishonest and manipulative despots.

Signing a petition will do nothing but make you <b>feel</b> like a good person, if you really want to make a difference and impact the environment in a positive way as soon as possible, then I suggest you Go Vegan! Each day, a person who eats a vegan diet saves 1,100 gallons of water, 45 pounds of grain, 30 sq ft of forested land, 20 lbs CO2 equivalent, and one animal‚Äôs life.

The critical issue is how fast it is moving. Rapid change is the real danger. Human habits and infrastructure are suited to particular weather patterns and sea levels, as are ecosystems and animal behaviors. The rate at which global temperature is rising today is likely unique in the history of our species. So if a species is unable to adapt to the new environment, guess what happens? It dies, It becomes extinct.	UCg6Hytx3pCl18ZFlgHYfB7Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg6Hytx3pCl18ZFlgHYfB7Q	1	Ugjez2nGeevKJHgCoAEC	The Conscientious Objector

Don&#39;t stand on your soap box and tell me you do your bit because you recycle. Global warming isn&#39;t caused by a lack of recycling, nor will the balance change.

Better move out of your house too, because a lot of carbon had gone into making that, go live in a cave, but don&#39;t wear animal skins to keep you warm because animals have rights you know? Just freeze to death in your nice cold cave because you can&#39;t light a fire because that makes CO2 as well. Now do you see how ridiculous all you greenies sound? Everything you use today is because of modern technology which yes will cause CO2 emissions, but hell, volcanoes and other natural sources produce way more than us humans will ever do, so just enjoy life, the earth has always changed and always will, sit back and enjoy the ride, or you could just end it all now and sacrifice yourself for Mother Earth, your choice.

Okay first off, why do you think they are doing this petition and the UN is bringing 196 countries together to stop global warming and pollution, this happens for a reason!! Secondly do any of you know what pollution is and what causes pollution (factory&#39;s, power stations, cars, buses, planes, everything that uses combustion)! Thirdly do you think the polar ice cap is melting (okay like if this makes u believe &quot;Global Warming&quot; isn&#39;t a real thing, I don&#39;t what makes you believe it&#39;s &quot;not a real&quot; thing?) Lastly deforestation is preventing trees from reducing CO2 back to oxygen! I seriously don&#39;t understand what goes through people&#39;s mind that convinces them that&#39;s it&#39;s &quot;not real&quot; So who&#39;s the culprit? Well we are, we as civilians can&#39;t do much apart from lower power consumption and stop buying products made in factory&#39;s or buying wood! But governments can!

Planned obsolescence is built into these products. Anyway, amusing observations aside, The &quot;Climate change&quot; label, subtly changed from &quot;Global warming&quot; a few years ago, whilst backed by lots and lots of scientific factual evidence (and not), we must realise that this movement has been hijacked, almost from the beginning, by a lobby of people (mostly billionaires, coincidentally) who want to use it to transfer wealth away from the masses through yet more enforced taxes on the lovely tax farms upon which you are allowed to live. Climate change is real, but so are the people using it to further enslave you into yet more debt. Instead of blindly following these campaigns, you will do a LOT more good if you start to examine the SUSTAINABILITY of everything you do and everything you consume. At the end of the day, the planet will be absolutely fine - it&#39;s just a question of whether WE will be here to enjoy it. I&#39;d prefer to see a campaign promoting the idea of Seven Generation Sustainability - look it up (but, I guess that isn&#39;t compatible with the Capitalists who want to run the show right now). And by Seven Generation Sustainability, I&#39;m not talking about a company, or an organisation, I&#39;m talking about the ecological concept that urges the current generation of humans to live sustainably and work for the benefit of the seventh generation into the future. It is that simple. Live with that concept in mind, every day, and you really won&#39;t need to be signing any petition!!!

I respect you all, love many of your channels but cutting &#39;emissions&#39; is only a TINY step in the right direction. The meat production industry IS the biggest cause of global warming by FAR!!!! It&#39;s tearing down rainforest faster than any other industry and the emissions (farts) from cows are destroying this planet. So big props for you campaigning for change, however the best way to create HUGE change is to adopt a VEGAN DIET. I hate to be the one to bring say this but it&#39;s the only way, cutting vehicle emissions is not the best cure not the easiest. The simplest is to simply to not eat animal products....

That this will NOT at all impact you or other life forms on this planet in ways that are detrimental?? You're saying that the ice caps (that, believe it or not, are HOMES and ways of LIFE for some creatures) are NOT melting due to this increase in warmth? That rising sea levels either is a HOAX or won't at all effect us? I'm sorry to object but we can clearly see these things- these changes occurring in our every day life. Yes, the world IS getting warmer. And yes, of course IT'S A BAD THING. Heat makes ice melt- that is fact. Melting ice produces water- that is also fact. And you don't have to be a master mind to see that there is a WHOLE LOT OF ICE in the world- which means a HECK OF A LOT OF WATER. Sea levels increasing means that some places WILL go underwater- I've seen it with my own eyes. Flooding levels have increased DRAMATICALLY since the 1900s here in Viet Nam. Must I repeat that, again, you DON'T HAVE TO BE A MASTERMIND TO SEE THESE THINGS. There is scientific evidence behind global warming- which I'm sure you are aware of. But how do we know that it's not a hoax? Well, lets just say that, AGAIN, you don't have to be a scientist- heck even a person with a reasonably good education to see that this is a real thing. Lets say that, hypothetically, all scientists, teachers, anyone to educate us on 'global warming' disappeared one day- poof. All previous knowledge on 'global warming' was erased. I am positive that we would still come to the same assumptions, the same conclusions of what is happening to our planet as we are now. Proving that we don't need scientists to provide us 'false information' to know that our planet is, clearly, in need of help. Anyways, have YOU ever tried making up a 'totally false theory' that you'd have to back up with 'totally false evidence' and 'totally false support'; all the while keeping it believable and successfully convincing 95% (which is around 7,014,775,106 minds) of the world? It's extremely difficult and not worth your time- much less scientists'/government officials' time. So, next time, if you'd even like a glimmer of a chance to convince me that something this big is not real- provide actual evidence and a full explanation. Thanks. And besides, what could SIGNING A PETITION possibly do to detriment you at all? Spread the lovin'. :)	UCJG6rcsrLtTFTeuozRIKx8w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJG6rcsrLtTFTeuozRIKx8w	1	UghMgcvnNGLpt3gCoAEC	Shaun Hughes Engraving

Just like the mini Ice Age that happened in Europe during the 19th century(why a lot of british stories of that time have snow in them). However these weren't global event as the world was and still is currently a global Ice Age. We are at the end of an Ice Age as we have large bodies of ice on both poles, during this temperate period land life flourishes(thats us!!). However it will end and yes it will end and we cant do anything to stop that. However it is meant to end in the next 30000-100000 years but due to an enhanced green house effect it has dropped down to more like 300 years and still dropping. Climate Change does exist, if it didnt then there would be no life on Earth! Also humans can speed up or slow down the process that is proven and it is not disputable.

Greed is the wall that stops us from helping others. Helping the homeless, the poor, planting trees, saving species and stuff - it all comes down to paying in order to save. By that I mean charities. It&#39;s sad that a piece of paper with a face on it worth so much is worth more than the life that enables us to make and pay that money in the first place. I wish everyone would come together instead of being greedy, everyone should have what they need in the means of a roof over their head and food and water and then money should come in to it. Of course money gives us a purpose in the means of working and doing something while you&#39;re alive, but when it comes to saving lives and animal species alive the damn planet, money shouldn&#39;t be an issue. It&#39;s frustrating to see the world as it is.	UCoUxUU2sJ-aXp9pZZxiwOkQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoUxUU2sJ-aXp9pZZxiwOkQ	0

UggNnh_668C_6HgCoAEC.86yqK3P5BQq8769yWZAvLM		2	2015-11-28 16:30:58	Greg Gonzalez	I've yet to watch "Cowspiracy", but I'll wager that one of it's postulates is that "Big Meat", a.k.a. the large corporations that produce animal flesh for our consumption, are the main reason that so many humans eat diets rich in meat. This is, to some degree, true: any developed industry will have major producers in it who have a vested interest in the public consuming their product. In democratic countries, it is natural for these entities to advocate for the continued, even increased, consumption of what they produce, regardless of the consequences to society at large. As to diets, it seems to me that human beings are built to be omnivores. Our dentition and digestive systems seem particularly suited to this role. There is a good deal of debate as to the proportions of vegetable to animal foods in our ancestral diets. Some have claimed that the ratio of these in the "paleo diet" was as high as 50-50, which seems ludicrous to me. Our ancestors were smart and clever, but hunting with primitve weapons and traps requires a high degree of skill and no small amount of luck to "bring home the bacon" on a regular basis. The gathering of non-animal foods was probably a much more stable source of nutrition throughout most of the year. A ratio of 80% vegetable to 20% animal foods seems, to me, to be a much more realistic assessment of the way our ancestors ate while during the bulk of the time wee were evolving. Meat still tastes good (to those of us who have not gone without it for a long while) because it is a nutritionally dense food source. But there is a cloud to every silver lining. Animal flesh is also dense in things that we could do well without, such as oxidizing agents and carcinogens. For those of us who do chose to consume meat, perhaps our contribution to the solution would be to eat less of it, maybe in the proportions stated above. I once heard that most people only need a 4 ounce portion of flesh ("about the size of a cigarette pack"), to satisfy their daily requirements for protein, fat, and several essential vitamins.

It just generally tastes better cooked. What makes an omnivore an omnivore is it's ability to eat and digest both meat and plants. A human could survive eating exclusively meat, same with only vegetables. A carnivore would die if it ate nothing but plants, and a herbivore would die if it ate nothing but meat. An omnivore can survive on both.	UCckuahneGObaOZfQmCwAKKQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCckuahneGObaOZfQmCwAKKQ	1	UggNnh_668C_6HgCoAEC	The Vegan Activist

Have you ever looked at a squirrel and just had an uncontrollable urge to rip the skin and blood from its limbs and swallow it whole, uncooked. If you put a baby in a crib with an apple and a bunny... you don't see it devour the bunny right? And that's before it has ever been taught to be civilised. Just because we have houses, clothes and technology it doesn't mean we're not animals, we have evolved from animals, so don't think that the carnivorous instinct to eat raw meat straight from the source excludes us just because we're civilised, we just simply don't have it because we aren't carnivores. Have you ever watched a cat... dog... lion... or a bear eat? They can't move their jaw left and right in a "chewing" motion like we can, only up and down, now compare humans to sheep, cows, horses... They all can move their jaws left and right. Herbivores. It's in the anatomy people! Carnivores can eat meat raw, we have to cook it before it becomes remotely consumable.

They are a bit difficult to manage though, and tend to take our children too if they should stray too far. The herbivores function in biology is to cycle the plants, the predators function to cycle the nutrients in the herbivore so their numbers don't exceed carrying capacity of the land and they begin to overgraze. Biomimicry can work in agriculture, but it is seldom used. Mostly because more harmful models of agriculture are subsidized by the government. One type of harm that is being subsidized is AGW. I know it sounds insane, but it is a fact.	UC60KmqgvHWDmn4R_tajRSnA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC60KmqgvHWDmn4R_tajRSnA	1	UggNnh_668C_6HgCoAEC	The Vegan Activist

It's not the cow that is to blame, but rather the way modern society raises those cows. They claim it has to be done this way to feed the world, yet failed to recognise that integrated mixed systems that include both crops and animal products are the most productive systems in the world, exceeding both animal husbandry alone and crops alone. The problem is the CAFOs. Those must end and end now. For example 95 % of the animal foods produced in the US are from CAFOs. Boycotting CAFO meat is a good thing. But the reason is to force a change in production methods, not to force everyone into turning into a Vegan. If you did actually force everyone into becoming Vegan, ALL these problems including AGW, get far far worse, not better.

This can be due to chemicals in the body but also radiation and just age. THe reasons why there is so much cancer and heart disease is yes due to our diet but also because we are living into our 80's. Cancer and heart disease is generally and old persons problem(there are exceptions). However none of this is because we have been eating meet as there has never been a society on earth that just ate vegan foods. Maybe if you go back from before we where hunter gather but we weren't even homo sapiens yet. If you have even done basic high school biology you would have learnt that the human digestive tract just simply does not have the complex intestinal tract to digest food for long term periods. Look at this http://biowiki.ucdavis.edu/@api/deki/files/1860/Figure_34_01_05ab.jpg?size=bestfit&width=1117&height=801&revision=1. The cecum is what allows for digestion of large amounts of plant matter, as you can see the human one is very small, in omniverse this is normal, in carnivores it does not exist and as you can see in the picture on the right herbivorous have incredibly large cecum's. This is just ONE reason why humans SHOULD NOT just eat plant matter.¬†	UCQmCA6QHF6R84FJ4pHiYnpg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQmCA6QHF6R84FJ4pHiYnpg	1	UggNnh_668C_6HgCoAEC	The Vegan Activist

Even if you supliment with natural products the human body is just not built for long term veganism, we are omnivores and are physiologically unable to process these foods long term. Its similar to alcohol, our body has a set amount it can process and filter out before it get overloaded. This is the same with the stomach and intestines for plant matter, herbivorous require extensive intestines and energy to process there food.

If we ever hope to create any real impact on our environmental status, we need to simply look at the most simple and overlooked part of our lives... our diet.

Power to Deceive and Depopulate.<br />Mother Nature takes care of population control like ever other living species which is why we have a shorter life span than trees (the earths lungs).<br />There is also more uninhabited areas on Earth than habited so why the wish to live or look for life on another Planet. No where is as beautiful or as bountiful as Earth so lets stop destroying it&#39;s Heart and Soul which makes it harder to flow with the natural order of Evolution.

Maybe. but will it be noticeable?<br />2. Increased volcanic activity and decreased solar activity, lead to cooling. Colder or warmer as a result, difficult to predict.<br />3.

The time frame for the evolution of the genus¬†Homo¬†out of thechimpanzee‚Äìhuman last common ancestor¬†is roughly 10 to 2 million years ago, that of¬†H. sapiens¬†out of¬†Homo erectus¬†roughly 1.8 to 0.2 million years ago. How many ice age's/warmings were there before people? There have been at least five documented major¬†ice agesduring the 4.6 billion years since the Earth was formed ‚Äî and most likely many more before humans came on the scene about 2.3 million years ago Today's History has been rewritten to make OUR children into a collective. Read the CONSTITUTION and get some real History (old) books. Research how little effect 100 yrs is to Earths billions.

The climate is dictated by nature, the total physical activity of the Sun not by the puny activities of human ants on the dot which is Earth. Global warming is a corporate agenda.

You had periods( lasting years) of excessive heat and drought and periods of extreme cold.<br />Stop supporting the taxation and regulations that hurt the poor and middle class and STOP programs like Agenda 21 or Agenda 2030 that want to transform the world into a place filled with huge prisonlike cities.

Now here is what I know about them. They travel - A LOT. So are they willing to cut emissions by forgoing their trips around the world, or from continent to continent or across the country? I really doubt it, but they want you to sign a petition, pushing your government to come to some kind of binding agreement to cut emissions. It really wont impact them much, most of them bring in enough money to absorb the costs, but do you. If you have your way energy prices will spike. You will pay more at the pump for your gas to get to and from work. If you live in the North East of the United States expect to see big jumps in the price of your heating oil if these people have their way. If you want to buy an airline ticket to visit your parents or grandparents, the price will increase. Your electric bills will go up. The cost buy groceries will jump, (it takes energy to produce food and transport it). If you are willing to sign their petition, be warned - if they are successful - you will pay and you will pay a heavy price.

Humans have some affect on it, but not enough to send the world into despair. The earth&#39;s gravitational pull with sun affects the temperatures. The earth is constantly correcting itself on its rotation around the sun. We are technically heading towards a ice age. The earth heats up right before it snaps back into an ice age.

What we're seeing now, though, isn't the end of the last ice age. Looking at atmospheric data from ice core samples going back hundreds of thousands of years, we can see the long, slow climb out from the ice age through our interglacial period. What's happening now, though, started as a huge lump that began in the mid-seventeenth century (when we started burning fossil fuels on a massive scale) and has grown into a large spike. The slower warming up from the ice age is still there, but it's being completely overshadowed by the additional warming. We even saw a small dip during the 1970's energy crisis when high fuel prices and shortages significantly decreased the consumption of oil. If the government was secretly putting additives in jet fuel and we had no idea what was going on, that would be bad regardless of the purpose. The issue is that we don't have any evidence that that is happening at all. The observed behavior of contrails is sufficiently explained by normal jet exhaust under the influence of atmospheric effects (this is where I suspect that you disagree with me most). I'm just not prepared to believe that a chem trails conspiracy is taking place until I see some good evidence for it.

Microbes an animals produce it (heterotroph). They balance it out!( Ewen seaweed consumes it and other fitoplangtons so it frtilises the ocean too) The other thing the sun's radiation it is the source of all the heat on Earth at least (98% 99%)!¬† And by the huge surface of the oceans and plants that ewaporate water back in the atmosphere it balances out! So if we have more heat on Earth we have more intense weather! Biger storms, hurricanes more often, bigger wind ,¬† more rain etc... but it keeps the balance. We have more to fear from an ice age that can be mutch more devastateing than global warming! And i think this global warming is becouse the end of the last ice age on earth so my conclusion: stop chem trails :D (i know it is hard to prowe they are doing global weather modification it is not my job to do this i just say it is bad that they do it, in seecret and we have no idea what is going on)	UCf2mAZ9y0aIcvoug0I3-ZdA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf2mAZ9y0aIcvoug0I3-ZdA	1	Ugjv9mKYO5miPngCoAEC	The B1 66-ER
Ugjv9mKYO5miPngCoAEC.86uwg1fn75Z87PVn8aOAcV		0	2015-12-06 04:47:13	Ben Garner	@L√°szl√≥ Is√≥¬†Yes, water vapor is a MUCH more potent greenhouse gas than CO2. Water vapor, though, remains pretty constant overall in the atmosphere. We don't have a problem like we do with CO2 with the levels rising much faster than it can be removed. because Unlike CO2, it has a very reliable method for balancing out its introduction to the atmosphere: rain. If we were to hypothetically cease all CO2 emissions today, it would slowly decline and return to the natural level over a period of a few hundred years. It takes a long time though, because the primary way that CO2 is absorbed in large quantities is by seawater. This acidifies the oceans (because it reacts with water to make carbonic acid), which is bad because it damages many organisms that are important to maintaining balance in the ocean ecosystems but are very sensitive to changes in pH, such as coral. Absorption by plants through photosynthesis, while an important part of the carbon cycle, isn't balancing the CO2 for 2 reasons. Primarily, it has to do with the fact that weather systems deal with much larger amounts of water than biological systems do with CO2. The Earth's surface is 70% water (of which most is deep ocean) and huge weather systems are constantly churning and redistributing the Earth's water. Photosynthesis-capable biomass cannot compete with these levels. Also, even though¬†although climate change is causing longer growing seasons further north with more vegetation and increased moisture in some areas, it is also causing desertification, drought, and reduced vegetation in other places. Note, though, that increased heat due to CO2 will cause increased evaporation and thus increased water vapor (although I am unsure if this would end up being balanced by increased precipitation). At any rate, the relative size of the contributions of water and CO2 are not the issue here. We NEED the greenhouse effect, primarily from water vapor, to keep our planet warm enough. However, changes in the levels of CO2 disturb our current climatological balance because, in aggregate, even a few degrees increase in the global average temperature makes HUGE differences; the global average temperatures during the last ice age were only about 2 to 4 degrees Fahrenheit lower. Our climate is currently kept in a fragile balance, and we really don't want to go poke the sleeping bear. Over the course of the long term, our climate will continue to change as it has been for billions of years. However, this usually happens at a MUCH slower rate so that life has had a chance to adapt. When these changes have gone really fast, we had insane mass extinctions with up to 90% of species going extinct. Who knows, we could end up becoming one of them...

In addition, looking at this phenomenon from an airplane, you might notice that every trails behaves the same way in the same area, same time. If you observe a long lasting and short life trail at the same time, it means big difference in the altitude between the two plane. It's all bout layered atmospheric conditions.

Your ignorance of simple chemistry demonstrates that you have NO business speculating about "chemtrails". Airplanes don't run on water, no; they run on jet fuel. What is jet fuel made out of? Short-chain hydrocarbon alkanes. So what happens when you burn alkanes in an oxygen atmosphere? The carbon is oxidized to CO2 and the hydrogen is oxidized to H2O (water), with a little over a 2:1 ratio of water to CO2. Mystery solved. "you might notice¬†that by some misterious reason some planes make big trails and some planes does not (same day same altitude), some days the sky is full of it and some days there is none!" Yeah, it's called weather. Different air masses can exist at the same altitude in different places, so you get temperature, humidity, and nucleogenic particle concentration differences. Another factor is that different engines will produce different exhaust with different speed, burn efficiency, temperature, turbulence, diffusion rate, etc. which will affect the contrails as well. The Illuminati/Reptilians/UN NWO/Jewish elites/aliens that you conspiracy theorists keep blaming for your imaginary problems would also have to be exposed to the effects of chemtrails, too, you know. What, are the Reptilians just immune or something? Give me a break.	UC5KVeeiaGeslYxO3PZduzGA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5KVeeiaGeslYxO3PZduzGA	1	Ugjv9mKYO5miPngCoAEC	The B1 66-ER

You've never stepped outside, have you? You've never interacted with other humans before. Am I being pranked? Because I don't see how you function in society. But wait, you probably blame that on everyone else for being brainwashed into not accepting you. It must be cramped living in a bomb shelter, and it must get itchy wearing a tin foil hat, and I bet it gets real lonely being the one "who knows" things that don't actually exist. Seriously, read some National Geographic, take some college classes, learn yourself some knowledge and logic. There is a thing called the Scientific Process, maybe start there. P.S.

Since the beginning of time, there's always been those who sought to be kings, and rule over others. Kings of the past learned from time, that eventually their evil acts would cause them to be dethroned. So nowadays they rule by proxy, he's not sitting on a throne. He's hidden and has politicians in his pocket, where they take the heat for their actions. He doesn't even realize that Obama is Bush 2.0, different public face, same king sitting in the background pulling their strings. He will dismiss what even the powers that shouldn't be, have been very open about and admitted themselves again and again. He's spent hours upon hours of his life letting media lie and propagandize to him, but he won't even spend a single hour GETTING THE TRUE AND ACCURATE SIDE. Because "it's not on TV, so it's not true". Ha... Unplug your TV and throw it out the window :D, that'll be the best decision in your life!

I'm against many Obama policies, but what you folks lack is good logic. You're looking for some bigger conspiracy and people to blame, there's not. Humans have contributed excess emissions and pollutants and the Earth is changing as a result. It's science, it's factual, it's the way things are. Our choices right now are to ignore our hand in the climate change, or do something to help slow things down and hope we haven't already caused irreversible damage. Or we could argue about how snake people are controlling the world's governments and are faking scientific evidence to brainwash us...

Who's grabbing power? Who's distributing wealth? These are basic questions that there's no good answer for, especially when you take into account that climate change actually is happening. But what am I saying, if you've done your research, you'd also know that California is suffering from the largest drought they've had in centuries, or that the 10 hottest years recorded have occurred in the past 20 years (with 2015 looking to be the hottest yet), and that the polar vortex has been super out of whack in recent years, and that we literally have nothing to lose other than making the world a better healthier, safer place. So even if you're still not convinced, what about things like oil and coal dependency, those resources that cost tons of money, cause massive ecological damage trying to get out of the ground, emit smog and smoke into the air we breathe, and are in limited supply? What would the harm be in using something that does none of those things, like solar or wind energy?

Global warming is a natural process " Scrap the rest. That's my argument in a nutshell. The climate has changed constantly for billions of years. The strongest argument these so called scientists can fathom is the average temperature has increased 1 or 2 degrees over the past hundred years, when each year has an average of 365 days. Give me a break. It may be logical, and i'm not denying humans have an effect on this planet, whether through climate or other matters...but this whole doomsaying of 'it's going to affect our lives tremendously' and 'the earth is doomed'. Bullshit. I live in Australia, renowned for it's outstanding heat...and South-east Oz just had it's coldest winter in decades (just an example). Ever notice how the name generally changed over the years from 'global warming', to 'climate change'? Suits themselves doesn't it? Of course the climate changes, but let's use a natural process to tax normal citizens and fear-monger. Anyway, that's my view, you have yours. I'll still hold to it until the evidence appears and i'm forced to install an air-con.

Even if the earth is going through a warming up phase, we are causing it to be faster. And if we pollute less, it will be healthier for our communities and our ecosystems. We should put in effort to conserve and recycle to help out our future generations. Most of my neighborhood recycles, and my dad even bought solar panels, and is planning to buy more before the government stops help paying 30% of it in a couple years. Don&#39;t be lazy. Do your part. The earth has and will continue to take care of us, if we take care of it.	UCqRihQImXZZNDYRbuhOtvIg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqRihQImXZZNDYRbuhOtvIg	0

That is not the question, the question is to what extent and is it doing it only due to Human impact(this has been proven wrong as the climate always changes naturally, we are coming out of an Ice Age. However climate change is affected by external factors and we are one of those factors, anything on earth is a factor). Also your argument about regulations destroys economies is total wrong as most of the best economies of the world are socialist and have quite largely regulated economies. Where as primarily capitalist countries economies are beginning or already have failed in our globalized world.

Except 3 billion of those who don&#39;t have any practical energy today, and are dying because of that everyday. If you think your solar panels will provide energy for them you are delusional. They need to burn fossil fuels TODAY. Climate is of no use to them if they will die today because their hospital has no reliable source of energy; no one will give them back their days spent on unnecessary work of which we people in the west had long time ago forgotten -its done by machines powered by fossil fuels again. No one will give them back days that are much shorter than for us due to lack of light; etc. Emission reductions affects people - but apparently not people we love - people we don&#39;t care about, so we have no problem institutionalizing them into poverty by restricting access to cheap, plentiful and reliable energy. Energy of coal, natural gas and oil.	UC7w1cZ3Qohk_Mz1KjEdqvGQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7w1cZ3Qohk_Mz1KjEdqvGQ	0

Energy sources like solar or biomass energy can have a wide range of emissions depending on how the energy is harvested. But it really isn't that big of a deal since climate change is natural in the first place.

Ich wollte dir auch eine l√§ngere Antwort schreiben, aber ich komme diese Tage gerade nicht so gut dazu... Bitte entschuldige. Umso mehr habe ich mich gefreut, dich hier aktiv zu sehen. Ich hatte auch schon kurz nach dem Erscheinen dieses uns√§glichen Videos kritisch kommentiert. Alles extrem schwierig und frustierend... Wenn die truther community doch nur einen Bruchteil des Marketingbudgets der Banker-Kabale h√§tte... Aber ein kurzes aufmunterndes Wort sollte allemal m√∂glich sein. In diesem Sinne: Hoffen wir darauf, dass mehr und mehr Leute aufwachen. Ich finde, dass dieses Video hier eine echte "truth bomb" erlebt hat.... Einfach toll, wie viele Kommentatoren hier aktiv sind und den global warming hoax der Eliten auch als solchen erkennen, benennen und blo√üstellen! Ein paar Kommentatoren kennt man auch von Kommentaren unter truther Videos... Die scheinen hier auch gezielt unterwegs zu sein. Sind aber auch nat√ºrlich viele mir unbekannte Kommentatoren am Start. Das sollte uns ein kleiner Trost und ein weiterer Ansporn sein... Alles Gute dir und bis bald!

One is for example that all people should unite and give themselves up to a thing - and that one thing is climate change. The elites always create worldwide problems (like fake terrorism, fake global warming or migration crisis) to show to the global public that nation states supposedly cannot solve problems on their own anymore... Nation states are portrayed as helpless bystanders. Hence the elites allegedly "proof" that we need and that we should have a one world government under the guidance of the "wise elite" and the UN(Rockefeller creation) to counter or solve those worldwide problems or challenges... Other problems like the migration/refugee crisis that the elites (the zionist globalists like Soros) also create lead to a further erosion of nation states and national sovereignty and therefor also help to push the alleged need for a global "answer" i.e. a global one world government...

That's propably¬†just the name "we" gave to a¬†heterogenic group (or several groups) that was/were supported / trained / funded / formed / paid¬†by mainly by the US. But also other countries seem to be involved. There's Turkey supporting them for several reasons. 1) The "boss" (USA) says so, 2) because they are willing to kill the Kurds, so Erdogan doesn't have to do it with his troops. 3) They are getting cheap oil from these groups. Saudi Arabia is supporting these groups massivly also with weapons, which are sent to them by western countries and then passed on to the several groups. Israel is also a big time ISIS supporter. That way they can get rid of Assad which is one of their goals. They want a greater Israel and therefore are happy that they don't have to kill all those muslims themselves. And many other countries are supporting them too. This war is a proxy war. Another one again. The question would be: Is there really a heterogenic group called "ISIS"? I am not sure about that yet. But much points¬†into that direction. There are propably several groups like "Al Nusra", "Al Quaida", "FSA" etc. who share a common goal: Getting rid of Assad and getting into power themselves, building a califate. I think "we" in the "West" just named them ISIS/IS/ISIL for having a good brand to put them all under as our supposed enemy. Not too easy to get a good and complete picture about what is going on down there.

A common theme at the meeting was that a global problem requires a global solution. That global solution is global government mandates, taxes and other forms of legislation (as well as various methods of implementation) that are alluded to in this letter. As outlined at the meeting, government and scientific goals include the reduction of the planet‚Äôs temperature by two degrees. The stated means by which to do this is to reduce (i) the CO2 usage every individual on the planet, as well as (ii) the carbon footprint of each nation. They (governments and corporations, scientific research and academia) are planning on doing this by implementing dramatic changes in the personal lives of individuals which most likely will include the monitoring of people via smart meters, using black boxes in cars and by other means. ¬†Some of those will measure and limit people‚Äôs CO2 usage, as well as take aggressive measures against people who go over their daily limits. If we support this agenda, a very likely example of a future scenario is the case of leaving a light on accidentally in our home and being monetarily fined because it constitutes a violation of a mandate that forbids us to have lights on during certain periods or for specified lengths of time during the day. Other examples of mandates are occurring in those states that currently tax people based on the mileage that they drive. This legislated policy is currently being carried out in certain states such as Oregon and could, if effective, be implemented worldwide. (Click here: Other planned mandates that have been discussed include limiting where, what days and how far we drive.) Also, because smart meters have the ability to monitor the appliances that are used in our homes and businesses, it is likely that we will be forced to upgrade our vacuum cleaners and dishwashers, dryers and wash machines as well as other appliances to newer models that are deemed by this agenda to be appropriately ‚Äúgreen.‚Äù If this agreement is passed, they (corporations) will have a means to control specifically what we do in our own homes, including the shutting down of our power, if and when we exceed the allotted amount of energy. This planned ‚Äúcarbon control dictatorship‚Äù is essentially a government/corporate carbon control matrix[1] that will invade every aspect of our lives, even determining what products we use and how we use them.!

The Desert is also one of the coldest places on earth... metaphor for... just because in some locations the temperatures are dropping massively does not mean they are not hotter in other areas.. CO2 does two things, it blocks incoming solar radiation and it keeps what solar radiation is inside the atmosphere in there longer. Also it is not just co2 but many gases.. that increase such.. So it has a both cooling and heating effects. We now call it climate change, not global warming, people really need to stop saying global worming, it could go either way, we are accelerating climate change in general.

In middle age, it was still much warmer than today. At that time, barley grew in Greenland, and vine in Stockholm. In Germany, the climate was like in Northern Italy today. So, global warming is something natural. But it hasnt got anything to do with CO2. Else, there would have the global warming we have now already in 1990. Because at that time, we had burnt almost the same amount of coal and mineral oil as today. Would the global warming have something to do with the CO2 in our atmosphere, it wouldnt appear suddenly, but connected with the CO2- production and the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere.

But how did we make the jump to ‚Äúcommunist shithole?" I'm genuinely curious. I do understand the idea of data manipulation (just look up the Koch brothers!), but I'm always fascinated by the thought process that goes into someone saying both "wake up and think for yourself," AND "sustainable energy means this country will be a communist shithole." I'd genuinely like to hear your input on that dichotomy. Also, a lot of conservatives are of the opinion that new industry is a good thing. Do you disagree? And how do you feel about the idea that companies who are spending billions of dollars to suppress science (and appeal to the idea that "you're too smart to believe what you can't see in front of you") might be creating more sheeple than the climate scientists possibly could, given that they don't have billions of dollars?

He for some reason thinks he can fortell the future, he's a a prophet coming up with a prophecy! lol Since the earth came to be there was always a changing climate, we humans aren't really effecting it much if at all and CO2 definitely is not effecting it much! Actually we are now since whenever they started geoengineering! (persistent chemical trails in the sky, grey streaked skies) We haven't gotten them to admit that they are doing it yet though, and they may try to use this as a way to leagize that activity and it defintely is harmful so it doesn't seem worth it if all they're doing it for is the following: I now believe they started this geoengineering simply to cause a bit of climate change maybe they did find a way to make man change the climate and it's not CO2! But they will claim it's CO2 using their fraud science because really it's their geoengineering that caused the climate to change so by not taking that into account and admitting to the geoengineering and accounting for that variable in their climate tracking, it makes it a total dishonest way to enact something so massive and global like this! Something starting out based on fraud is not a good sign for things to come after if it's allowed to exist! Look up anything I've said this is real stuff! Don't be fooled by propaganda though and stop (because those are likely the first things you'll find), really research further and you will find the real info.

They even solicited (unsuccessfully) ideas for missions to prove that global warming was not natural (the Sun primarily). My company asked me to look into designing such missions. The Bush administration even tried to gag (unsuccessfully) scientists working on global warming research by requiring approval for papers,posters,and presentation(s) from a Bush-appointed tsar before publication,and not allowing them to go to conferences to discuss the issue or talk to the press if they were on a government grant.

Yes we all know they came up with the theory first, then had to bend the data around to match it, rather than the other way around. (the proper way, well if you want to call it science that is) So why do you think they chose CO2? If you actually are interested in the science aspect, rather than propaganda, you would acknowledge that: "Increasing CO2 has almost no effect on the climate, as we have seen over the past 19 years. Trenberth knows this ‚Äì this is the same model he uses for his weather and climate models. Scientists who claim that increasing CO2 is dangerous, are either ignorant or dishonest."

They are trying to get countries to pass laws / policies that will help us lower emissions. Its in the video", and you are right, that is what they said. The problem is that this strategy has no chance of working. Emissions is only 1/2 the battle. It is a biological carbon cycle. 1/2 the carbon cycle is beneficial, and what matters is balancing the entire carbon cycle as a whole. What matters is the NET flux from stable to active carbon cycles. Basically we are talking the stable soil carbon fraction and fossil fuels as the stable pools, and the rest of the carbon that cycles actively is just part of the life cycle of plants and animals. There are frozen methane clathrates in the ocean and permafrost that can be a concern should they melt rapidly, but that is more of a feedback concern, if we fail to get the other pools stabilized. More of a symptom that magnifies, not an initial cause. This is one of the things that, if it happens, will dramatically amplify the seriousness of AGW. Any agriculture of any type that increases the stable carbon pool in the soil is not creating AGW, but rather is helping mitigate AGW. So the answer is not simply cutting fossil fuel emission, but rather using agricultural methods that increase soil carbon at a higher rate than they use fossil fuels, for a NET reduction in atmospheric greenhouse gasses back into the stable pools. If you want to help, give up foods produced from land decreasing in soil carbon, and replace it with food produced from land increasing in soil carbon. We don't need politicians or petitions for that, although governments could help by ending subsidies for models of agriculture that cause soil degradation.

Carbon dioxide *is* a poisonous compound when inhaled (or eaten if the pressure permits). It also causes toxicity in water. Technology invented is not responsible for carbon dioxide emissions, that would be the lack of capturing the molecules. Hence why everyone is calling for global reform of emission policies. If you haven't already known, there has been methods to stop 99% of carbon emissions in factories for over a decade, the lack of government policies allows businesses to simply choose to opt out. It costs money, but it's just going to cost exponentially more in the future. I find it ironic though you're calling me an idiot when I have to take a few minutes just to decipher your incoherent dialect. There are many more harmful molecules other than carbon dioxide though. To name a few; methane, nitrous oxide, chlorofluorocarbons (and HFCs), ozone, water vapor, F-gases, and so on.

The plants of the world produce less heat than a vehicle for personal use, there is no sense to deal with minority, reduce traffic, and reduce the temperature. I am from Rostov-on-Don, Russia(1,2M person, 800kCars). In the year of the Olympic Games technology for clearing snow hijacked in Sochi, a consequence - hello russian winter , hello traffic 15 km/h (9 M/h), on the second day there were only buses and rare enthusiasts used their private cars. The temperature dropped another 8 degrees, but the feelings were warmer, all because of the absence of vapors from gasoline vehicles, which reduced the level of humidity of about 30%.<br />And sorry for my bad / poor English.

If you get into a boat and travel in a line across the [curved] surface, I guarantee that you will end up at the same spot as you started as long as there aren't land barriers in the way. Also, as a physics major, I highly doubt that you'll be pulling up "an equation I cant understand that supposed to tell you what gravity is."

Because the threat is so extreme, but our physiological response is insufficient (lack of adrenaline, fight or flight, insufficient urgency, too little voltage across synapses) we judge the threat to be either false (denial) or we overestimate the the strength of the reasons not o act to explain our inaction, we make excuses for why we can&#39;t act. But we are merely explaining away our biologically inadequate response to slow threats.	UC7I4BijcECZS4bW_F7t-VAQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7I4BijcECZS4bW_F7t-VAQ	0

We&#39;re stopping climate change to SAVE OURSELVES. Somehow, that just doesn&#39;t sound as good. Planet Earth, during it&#39;s 4.5 billion years, has endured FAR worse than what we are doing. We&#39;re simply making it unsuitable for human life, and for several other species.<br /><br />We cause climate change, and we&#39;re gonna suffer - but don&#39;t make it a holier-than-moi issue about &quot;saving the planet&quot;.

Apparently some scientists were doing an experiment where a frog was dropped in a pot of boiling water. Of course, the frog escaped as fast as it could.<br /><br />But when the frog was put in a pot with water that had a comfortable temperature, it stayed without a problem. Then the scientist started to heat up the water. Slowly, the temperature was rising in the pot of water, nearing boiling hot... But the frog didn&#39;t care. It just stayed in the water, completely ignorant of the temperature raising up. It just stayed... didn&#39;t try to do anything... didn&#39;t acknowledge the danger... until it was too late.<br /><br /><br />Let us not do the same mistake <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ourstolose">#ourstolose</a>	UCnsvr7RNnDTqlnvYluIiIxQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnsvr7RNnDTqlnvYluIiIxQ	0

I&#39;m a physics and mathematics major, and for those who think this is a myth, you&#39;re sadly mistaken. Carbon dioxide emissions account for approximately 84 percent of all greenhouse gases; 57 percent of which is CO2 emitted from the use of fossil fuel.<br /><br /><br />Apart from CO2, the other main greenhouse gases are classified as: methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), ‚Äòfluorinated‚Äô gases (F-gases such as CFCs or HFCs), water vapor, and even ozone (O3) itself. F-gases and nitrous oxide are classified as ozone-depleting gases (ODGs), as they disseminate ozone; an important proponent in blocking UVB radiation. F-gases have since been ‚Äòphased‚Äô out and heavily regulated by the Montreal Protocol, and nitrous oxide is now the leading cause of depletion. This is due to radiation from the sun that creates nitric oxide, which in turn destroys molecules of ozone.<br /> The other gases mentioned do not deplete ozone, but rather trap heat from escaping the atmosphere, including methane and CO2. Methane is mostly released by human activities, largely by natural means such as manure management and cattle due to their digestive process. Although methane levels are just a fraction compared to CO2 emissions, methane is comparatively more destructive; roughly 30 times more destructive. ‚ÄúMethane is the biggest contributor of short-term climate pollutants.‚Äù(Environmental Defense Fund).

The facts are simple - there are alternatives for Poland, and the same taxes you complain that aren't working - are actually driving Poland to increase its national renewable energy to 15% by 2020! It's the official plan that was literally comissioned due to the European Union.¬† About Florida/California... They won't ban freaking solar energy. California actually has a standard they need to reach by 2020 - 33%, and 50% by 2050.¬† Florida has a few big solar plants, and it's generally starting to build solar panels on newer buildings right from the start.¬† You live in a fantasy world, patent laws are there to protect people that come up with patents.¬† China, in comparison to the US has barely any patents themselves. They almost never 'come up' with things, they always copy them and tweak them to be cheaper and sometimes better.¬† Ever heard of the term 'brain drain'?

It's the 2nd biggest economy in Central Europe and 6th in all of Europe, beating Denmark, Belgium and Finland - which have green energy. By the way, Denmark is FILLED with coal too.

So stop with the patronizing tone and look at the results, not the excuses for new regulations. And argument about exporting coal is absurd - what is the difference who will burn it? As long as it is mined it will be burnt sooner or later. It makes as much sense as claiming atomic energy clean and then paying African countries for taking radioactive waste. I never claimed the conspiracy theory to be true. You explicitly asked where people take those from so I answered. Whether is it true or not it is highly unjust when higher developed countries (that have been burning fossil fuels much longer than rest of the world) are taxing less developed ones for not being reach enough yet to switch to other forms of energy.

Did you notice what is the only result of all those climate summits? New taxes. Nothing more. Let&#39;s take Poland as an example. European Union took new policy of fighting with global warming. According to this policy, coal is the most taxed fuel. Those taxes go to European Union budget. Poland has only one real natural resource: coal. We do not have oil, gas, uranium, pluto, hot springs nor waterfalls in every village. It is not particulary sunny nor windy here as well. As a result we are forced to use coal to heat our houses during 4-5 months a year and to produce energy. And now we are paying 50% more for heating and 30% more for energy. And we use exactly the same amount of coal we used before...	UC0JZz5HIJiL3F1u60crbH5g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0JZz5HIJiL3F1u60crbH5g	1	Ugjwt98Q9bwlbHgCoAEC	michelle fanter

However, if the politicians were too "unfair" with how they regulate the emissions of the industry, the industry would simply die. Companies would be bankrupt. As such, CO2 (which is one of the major contributors to global warming) is chosen instead, since in many cases, it would still be beneficial for companies to reduce their CO2 emissions. For example, for aircraft, reducing fuel burn would be equivalent to reducing CO2 emissions, thereby saving them money at the same time.

It's aimed more-so at the industry. It will force them to adopt greener practices, or else, pay higher taxes. Or it might force, say, the automotive industry to make greener vehicles for consumers to purchase. It's not going to be some sort of oppressive control over individuals. Like what the hell?

Even global warming can&#39;t change that. What we do have is a low land... Half of the netherlands is below sealevel.... But we are masters at controlling water so that&#39;s not going wrong either.

Luckily the weather, the environment, habitats and continents changed, because a static world where everything is equal always, only ensure the death of all life. So, life is change, transformation and especially death: without death life is impossible ... a few others will arrive, others go... is the life-cycle of the universe and that&#39;s good (and necessary)!<br /><br />So, it should be! and we can not pretend that all (individuals or species) remain immutable and eternal ... that&#39;s unnatural!<br />Climate change has made the planet what it is ... If we want things never change, we favor only the extinction of life itself.<br /><br /><br />We must minimize and hopefully stop pollution? Of course!<br /><br />But those who must give strong and decisive step? The industries: they are producing garbage... no matter if all we stop littering the street, but the industry did not start using massively and only biodegradable materials, then any individual awareness campaign will fizzle!<br /><br />The industry should stop producing garbage and nonbiodeg-waste and so consumers do not shoot back to the street or the ocean!<br /><br />But even more important is that the scientific developments and technologies able to generate materials clean up what we have fouled: only science and technology allow repair the damage we have done in 300 years or more.

It is inevitable that the poles of the Earth are going to shift in the near-ish future, as they have done many times in the past. Humans only speed up the process a tiny bit. A few important people say something about not emitting as much Carbon-Monoxide and Carbon-Dioxide levels, and all of a sudden, the entire country is fussing about how we&#39;re destroying the Earth. The poles reverse every 10,000 to 20,000 years, which makes it prime time for that to occur.	UCvLAvAmh3XPRt7o2Kz0rGdA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvLAvAmh3XPRt7o2Kz0rGdA	0

The climate used to be hotter than it&#39;s know which means it gets hotter and colder all the time, the change isn&#39;t caused by humans!!!

The planet has been through light years worse than what we could ever do to it. It always fixes itself, and its never actually broken. When a volcano erupts it sends more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than if human emmission were at 1996 levels for 100 years straight. The climate has always been changing, prove me wrong.

Don&#39;t feed their ignorance. Only explain with the purpose of giving as much information as you can and move along. Try not to let it devolve into an argument. <br /><br />If a lost cause seems to be just that, then just move along. Devolving to their level and resorting to insults and inserting straw men here and there will just solidify their own misled opinion they believe into something they &quot;know&quot; if they&#39;re not at that point already. It sucks but some people are manipulated by these groups too easily. Thanks all	UCLuxmGUnfwa6reHJv6d5a9Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLuxmGUnfwa6reHJv6d5a9Q	0

The planet is nearest of sun and it needs to change. It is necesary, you have nothing to do, the man is not responsible. And let me tell you, the only thing that goverments can do is &quot;change weather through the HARP Proyect&quot;. This way they can manipulate climate, make rain, hurican, dry, tsunami, earthquake, get worm, get cold, everything you want. Global Worm is a Lie invented by man as the greenhouse efect.

UgitAFimMTIojHgCoAEC.86ueTsEmPZb871FCa_jtJc		0	2015-11-26 18:40:31	Mr Music	@Granuke GamingProductions¬†"The upward trend in the Antarctic, however, is only about a third of the magnitude of the rapid loss of sea ice in the Arctic Ocean." ... "A warming climate changes weather patterns, said Walt Meier, a research scientist at Goddard. Sometimes those weather patterns will bring cooler air to some areas. And in the Antarctic, where sea ice circles the continent and covers such a large area, it doesn‚Äôt take that much additional ice extent to set a new record."... ""‚ÄúThe winds really play a big role,‚Äù Meier said. They whip around the continent, constantly pushing the thin ice. And if they change direction or get stronger in a more northward direction, he said, they push the ice further and grow the extent. ¬†When researchers measure ice extent, they look for areas of ocean where at least 15 percent is covered by sea ice.". You really should actually read what your sources are saying mate.¬† As for the rest of your questions: How do we measure climate change?: http://climate.nasa.gov How do you know that we are contributing more to climate change now that 10 years ago?: I don't know if there are any studies on this, but I think we are contributing less. How do we stop climate change?: There is no clear answer, but given that we are contributing to it by emitting large quantities of carbon dioxide, we simply must cut down our emissions.¬† How do we know how much it will take to stop climate change?: It's hard to give an exact answer. After all, we don't know exactly how much we are contributing with to begin with. What one can do is compare CO2 emissions thought history and how global temperatures have changed, and make a rough calculation on how much we need to cut down on emissions to bring the warming up of the planet to a halt.¬†	UCSA3Uyn9Lu1_TMP_ZOgvbhg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSA3Uyn9Lu1_TMP_ZOgvbhg	1	UgitAFimMTIojHgCoAEC	Tyler Wilkinson

I never claimed that I knew a whole lot, but ive looked at the evidence provided by both sides and have come to the conclusion that a lot of this has been blown way out of proportion. And, speaking of top scientists, NASA claims that we could enter a mini ice age. In contrast with Nasa, the IPCC claims that July this year was the hottest on record (interestingly enough the scale only goes back to 1840). I have actually visited the Northern hemisphere in July this year, it was anything BUT hotter than previous years (previous years in July). In short the IPCC's claim is crap.

I mean, sure, we could perhaps slow the progress down a bit, and that is certainly a worthy endeavor: Give humanity as much time as possible before nature gets even worse. But I don&#39;t see humanity in any way stopping or reverting the climate changes. Even if we go nuts with replanting the rainforests, and cutting down CO2 production dramatically (of which seems highly unrealistic), temperatures will continue to rise. Just.. at a bit smaller rate. We&#39;ve set off a chain-reaction, and there is no stopping the train.	UCe8z02hRMXC53jpQbTA5VFA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe8z02hRMXC53jpQbTA5VFA	0

You go hunt them to reduce population. Same thing is with humans there&#39;s waaaay too many of us for earth to sustain without climate change and huge environmental impact. I am not promoting violence or a genocide all i am saying is just we have to keep the numbers down by preventing people from being conceived. And less of us there is the more space we will have and more resources and all that stuff. Why live 10 billion poor hungry and without shelter when we can be 3 billion healthy, sheltered and always fed without all the garbage and pollution 10 billion would produce...just ditch religious crap and make a change by not having kids because if this keeps happening world will break into a global war over clean water one day i guarantee it 110%	UC1ulkHP7IQgbxlOCi0DVr9Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1ulkHP7IQgbxlOCi0DVr9Q	0

Stable carbon in the soil is humus and the loss of humus in our soils is larger by far than all the fossil fuels burned since the industrial revolution.¬† My only conclusion I have been able to come up with is that agriculture is off the debate only because of the myth that our antiquated agricultural systems, although proven harmful to the soils, are required to feed the world. This myth prevents people from searching for both causes and solutions outside of fossil fuels. This prevent people from looking at biological system function as both the true cause and the solution (should we change the ways we do agriculture).

There is a problem, be sure. The easiest way to describe that problem is we have too much carbon in the atmosphere and too little carbon in the soil. The amount of carbon missing in our soils is actually more than the extra in our atmosphere, so years from now we might even be forced to burn even more fossil fuels just to prevent another ice age. But that is a LONG LONG time in the future. Soil degradation is a problem right NOW. AGW is a problem right NOW. So right NOW we need to get as much of that extra atmospheric CO2 into the soil as quickly as possible so we don't accidently melt the methane clathrates in the permafrost and oceans. That would be a huge extinction level event.	UC60KmqgvHWDmn4R_tajRSnA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC60KmqgvHWDmn4R_tajRSnA	1	Ugj5YeaOFV6NrHgCoAEC	supermonkeyyyyyy

Ugj5YeaOFV6NrHgCoAEC.86udKe7Jzng873kWmch-BP		0	2015-11-27 18:01:22	Red Baron Farm	+boosomentity My point is that it is agriculture at the root of the problem. Fix agriculture, and then the natural biological system that turns CO2 ultimately into fertile rich black soil via the photosynthesis pathway and decay into humus, will be restored over 40% of the Planet's land surface. Do that and I am pretty sure the tiny bit of fossil fuels CO2 will be quickly absorbed. Since humus rich soils are more fertile, probably will also increase food production too, and reduce erosion too. It will even reduce floods and help mitigate the effects of drought too.

You said, "The actual climate change comes from meat industry". Not entirely true, but close enough. It is a big problem. So its close enough that I can agree in principle. Where you failed was in your conclusion, "As long as humans keep eating meat at the actual rate, the climate change is unstopabble" Instead the proper conclusion is to change the models for animal husbandry in such a way as to not be a net contributor. It has been proven time and time again that it is possible to do that. We do not need to raise animals in confinement barns and stockyards. There is no fundamental NEED for industrial production of animal husbandry. Animals do quite well raised on pasture when properly managed. If you want to help, simply stop eating industrial produced animal foods, and replace it with properly managed animal foods. The markets will adjust if enough people do that. When the markets adjust due to changes in demand, the farmers will change to meet that demand. Do that and AGW will be quickly mitigated.

Global warming leads to climate change, and no, it's not just a new layer of paint to stay relevant, it's an update. We don't say the planets go around the sun in perfect circles anymore, we know they go around in ellipses, or slightly flattened circles. From the beginning, people knew that global warming could change the climate. Unless you have no basic understanding of ecology, environments are very sensitive. Also, global warming is a "proven hoax"? Citation needed.	UCOE-jDotoGvNB9vcBYo9hiA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOE-jDotoGvNB9vcBYo9hiA	1	Ugj5YeaOFV6NrHgCoAEC	supermonkeyyyyyy

Luckily the weather, the environment, habitats and continents changed, because a static world where everything is equal always, only ensure the death of all life. So, life is change, transformation and especially death: without death life is impossible ... a few others will arrive, others go... is the life-cycle of the universe and that's good (and necessary)! So, it should be! and we can not pretend that all (individuals or species) remain immutable and eternal ... that's unnatural! Climate change has made the planet what it is ... If we want things never change, we favor only the extinction of life itself. We must minimize and hopefully stop pollution? Of course! But, who must give strong and decisive step? The industries: they are producing garbage... no matter if all we stop littering the street, but the industry did not start using massively and only biodegradable materials, then any individual awareness campaign will fizzle! The industry should stop producing garbage and nonbiodeg-waste and so consumers do not shoot back to the street or the ocean! But even more important is that the scientific developments and technologies able to generate materials clean up what we have fouled: only science and technology allow repair the damage we have done in 300 years or more.

Egypt is probably the best example. Except rich people, which count for only 1-2% of the population, humans was eating a very small amount of meat, which is why, there's so many health issue related to too much meat, specially because people eat muscles and fats. Even during prehistoric ages, humans couldn't survive on meat alone, for 2 reasons. Animals was actually hard to catch for people who hadn't the technology and deer abundance we have now and it was very hard to conserve meat for a long period as we do now. So prehistoric humans had to survive also on wild comestible plants. If we go back further in time, if you believe in evolution, our first diet was fruits and insects. Anyway, all this is appeal to tradition and appeal to nature. Right now, we have a better understanding of nutrition and science than our ancestors, so basing our logic on them is a fallacy. Nutrition today says, it is completely healthy to eat vegan at all stages of life if it's well planned, just like non-vegan diet.

But in summary: On ethical grounds, even though I hate ranking cruelty... eggs and dairy are WORSE than the meat industry. 50% of all chickens are born male, they are all killed because they are economically not viable (no eggs). Old egg laying hens are killed because they are economically not viable (to little eggs). As for dairy, the baby calves are all killed because VEGETARIANS want to drink their milk. And old dairy cows are killed because they stop producing enough milk. Environmental grounds... animal agriculture is animal agriculture, it will require the same amount of land and water and produce the same amount of GHG's (up to 51% currently) and they will still eat up insane amounts of food. Not to mention the detrimental health effects. 40% of all chronic diseases (which account for 80-90% of all deaths in the western world) are attributed to unhealthy diet (cholesterol, saturated fat, and to a minor degree, processed sugar).

''Agriculture might seem green by definition, but farming accounts for a lot of greenhouse-gas emissions when the entire food production system is taken into account. Typically, estimates of greenhouse-gas emissions from agriculture are around 11%-15% of global emissions. Estimates discussed earlier this week at the¬†United Nations Climate Summit¬†put that number closer to 50%. This is an important calculation as climate change issues come to the fore, with record greenhouse-gas emissions and international negotiations to halt that rise. The reason for the difference is that the 11%-15% estimates only take into account emissions from the farming part of agriculture, such as plowing and fertilizing. The¬†U.S. Environmental Protection Agency‚Äôs¬†14% estimate, for example, includes emissions from agriculture‚Äôs mechanical equipment,¬†soil management, enteric fermentation (which produces, say, belches from a cow), manure management, rice cultivation and field burning. It doesn‚Äôt include transport, food processing, packaging, and sale of agricultural products. The 43%-57% estimates, which are published in the¬†United Nations Conference on Trade and Development‚Äòs 2013 Trade and Environment Review, look at food production more broadly to also include emissions from land-use change and deforestation, as well as the processing, packaging, transport and sale of agricultural products.''

As for organic farming, it consumes far, faaaar more land than factory farming. And since *the main reason for climate change is deforestation due to organic livestock*, you would end up doing more environmental harm than you currently are.

The opposite of Global Warming is Global Cooling (whoa no surprise there) and it is natural for the Earth to go through these changes. The amount that humans contribute to Global Warming each year is only about 5-6 Gt. I&#39;m not saying that we should stop caring about this change, I&#39;m just saying that it&#39;s impact is blown out by media way more than it actually is in real life. There was a period where Earth&#39;s temperatures rose very high, higher than it is right now, and the Romans loved it. We should still keep in touch with how we are impacting the environment and try not to leave a large footprint, just saying that it is not an event that should not be occurring.<br />Also, how do the view count and likes/comments have such a large range?

LMAO! CO2 is CO2 don't confuse it with carbon in general, that confusion is there for a reason, LOOK INTO IT and you'll discover how much of a fraud this is! As for little shadow government, yeah that's the only defense you guys have against TRUTH... I guess Putin is mentally ill then too for stating the obvious? "The Russian president believes that "there is no global warming, that this is a fraud to restrain the industrial development of several countries including Russia," says Stanislav Belkovsky, a political analyst and critic of Putin. "That is why this subject is not topical for the majority of the Russian mass media and society in general." --Reuters, 29 October 2015 Putin's climate scepticism dates from the early 2000s, when his staff "did very, very extensive work trying to understand all sides of the climate debate", said Andrey Illarionov, Putin's senior economic adviser at the time and now a senior fellow at the Cato Institute in Washington. "We found that, while climate change does exist, it is cyclical, and the anthropogenic role is very limited," he said. "It became clear that the climate is a complicated system and that, so far, the evidence presented for the need to 'fight' global warming was rather unfounded." That opinion endures. During a trip to the Arctic in 2010, Putin acknowledged that "the climate is changing", but restated his doubt that human activity was the cause."

"Putin's climate scepticism dates from the early 2000s, when his staff "did very, very extensive work trying to understand all sides of the climate debate", said Andrey Illarionov, Putin's senior economic adviser at the time and now a senior fellow at the Cato Institute in Washington. "We found that, while climate change does exist, it is cyclical, and the anthropogenic role is very limited," he said. "It became clear that the climate is a complicated system and that, so far, the evidence presented for the need to 'fight' global warming was rather unfounded." That opinion endures. During a trip to the Arctic in 2010, Putin acknowledged that "the climate is changing", but restated his doubt that human activity was the cause."

Without the greenhouse effect earth would be fluctuate in temperature way to much to support life. One day it will 200 degrees the next -170. CO2 keeps the heat in so we can survive what scientist mean when they say human cause climate change is enhanced co2, which is where this process becomes to effective and does not let any heat leave(this can be caused be natural events and human action as well).

If the temperature increases, then more water is going to evaporate, hence more water vapour will be present in the atmosphere. You're implying that if the Earth was blanketed completely in ice then the atmosphere would be very humid, or that if the Earth's oceans evaporated the atmosphere would somehow also be dry.

The amount of water vapour present in the atmosphere depends on the temperature of the atmosphere. More heat = more vapour present. In this way, the vapour magnifies the effects of climate changes. (This is also why some people advocate hydrogen fuel as a clean energy, even though water vapour is a greenhouse gas). Also, it's extremely misleading to look compare human greenhouse gas emissions to natural emissions. What's important is the *overall change* in greenhouse gas concentrations. The natural sources and sinks very closely balance each-other out - it's only human emissions which are causing the overall change.

There is a very clear correlation between the amount of CO2 present in the atmosphere and average global temperatures. The amount of CO2 has consistently increased since the industrial revolution, and this is due to human activity. The average global temperature has also increased (fairly) consistently throughout this period. Humans have a significant effect on their environment.

Because that's totally unsupported by the evidence, and has been known to be true for more than 150 years (see the work of John Tyndall). If you're saying because there was some warming, hundreds of years ago, which wasn't caused by humans, then you may well be right! However, this doesn't disprove that the present day warming is caused by humans. There are no natural factors which can account for the warming on their own.

And even if it was true, you're going to just completely disregard more than one hundred years of previous warming?

Yes these "scientists" DO KNOW what IS WHAT but they are trying to DECEIVE you! Don't you get it! They know CO2 doesn't effect temperatures much at all, so it's not much of a variable to be focused on, since it is predictable how much minimal heat it will produce and it's small enough that it wont hurt the earth! lol!

Do you really think scientists don't know that ? As I said it's growing back but not to the level of what it would have grown in 1950 for example. It's recovering less and less surface every winter (exept these 3 or 4 last years) and what the consequence ? The polar albedo is weaken so sun rays get to warm polar water in more areas because there is no more ice there. Oh and Algor indeed fucked up his predictions I'm not denying it.

Now you didnt even have a logical counter argument so youre trying to divert the attention from your ignorance again. I dont hate college students, I just hate the ones that are so dumb, that they dont even realize theyre dumb, like you. And wrong, you DONT have an education. If you do, why is it that Im destroying you in every way possible? Also "affordable" ahh the socialist is coming out of the closet, as expected. Ever thought about it that I didnt go to college because I didnt want to, and not cuz I couldnt lol Theres nothing that college couldve given me that I cant get myself on my own effort. College is practically for those who cant stand on their own feet by their own effort. Keep trying. And Im still waiting for a rational counter argument.

To you it doesnt make sense because your mind is clogged with propaganda. If you cant process simple logical information like the fact that the climate has been changing since the planet existed more radically than today, then youre the proof the internet should be IQ restricted. What doesnt make sense is believing marxist professors and scientists, because they say that they know the entire history of the planet based on the few decades of studying that we have done so far. What does make sense is these typically booksmart out of touch with reality asshats looking down on the general population, thinking how dumb we are and assuming that they have the right to control us with well thought out lies. All you gotta do is look past these lies and youre free from their psychological prison. The other major misbelief is that those who go to college are smarter than those who dont. So far, Ive met more people who didnt go to college and were smarter than the average college student, than the other way around. But your leftist marxist professors already clogged your mind with bullshit like college students being smarter, climate change and etc. I bet you even believe socialism and communism is good. lol Theres that saying, I never went to college because I was too busy learning stuff.

So you failed to prove the climate didnt change before the 1950s and youre trying to divert the attention from this failure onto me not providing a biased source? lol Youre pathetic. Did dinosaurs exist? If yes, then theres your evidence. And no actually you cant think for yourself because if you did you wouldnt be obsessed with something you have no influence over. And again, youre telling me somebody studied the cycles for atleast a million years, which is not much at all, to have some understanding on whats a big change and whats not? Cool story. Keep trying. See, you or any other climate change freak have no idea whats "faster" and slower and "too much". Whether or not we exist, the climate would change exactly the way it does. And by the time it changes to a point where its uninhabitable by humans, about 2 million years from now, I doubt we'll be living on this planet anyway. Either way your argument is meaningless. I refuse to carry the weight of lazy fucks just because you and your marxist professors have an agenda.

Climate change is a cyclical change that is happening and was happening since the beginning of time. The earth is subjected to periods of regular cyclical warming and cooling, and sea levels have been rising steadily as long as any record can show, and the greenhouse gas theory has been debunked. Scientific CONSENSUS is not always correct. Many global warming advocates that identify themselves as "scientists" and say that global warming is indeed man-made actually have nothing to do with the field of climate or meteorology. The founder of the Weather Channel says that global warming is a scam as well! Air pollution is bad, but it does not cause global warming. Air pollution is a terrible problem that we need to combat, especially within the urban populous, but saying that this causes global warming is absurd. What is popular is not necessarily correct, right?	UCw4ULfICXpDhjQG4YDLLW0g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw4ULfICXpDhjQG4YDLLW0g	1	Ugg7yMEqOBbkTngCoAEC	Ibetiwon

It states that although Antarctica has gained about 250,000 sq. ft. of sea ice in 2012 compared to 1979, the Arctic has lost about 1.3 million sq. ft. of sea ice in 2012 compared to 1979. The net change? Well, a loss of sea ice. The authors believe that this simply shows that global warming is non-uniform, which makes sense since the climate over various areas of the Earth are not the same. You also have to account for things such as natural occurring currents which carry hot and cold water and air around the world.

Furthermore, liquid (i.e. water) expands when heated. Those are two basic mechanisms for rising water levels. If you don't believe basic chemistry, then I'm not sure what I can say to dissuade you.

Back then, the international community tentatively agreed to the Kyoto Protocol, which basically said that Developed Countries (e.g. USA, CAN, Japan, etc.) had the responsibility of reducing emissions, whereas Developing Countries (e.g. Korea, China, India, etc.) were off the hook because they were too poor to worry about solving the issue. Now that these countries have developed their economies, its no longer fair for them to get special attention. They are polluting the atmosphere much more than us! So what does this mean? Well, for developing countries, they will have to start owning up to their own problems instead of relying on our money to solve their problems. Of course he would be against that. Wouldn't you?

Here's why: - The Earth has kept a pretty stable climate for the past 12,000 years. - In the 120,000 years that homo sapiens have existed, we have went through 20 sudden global warmings without any type of machine to produce any type of greenhouse gas. Average temperatures in most of these have shot up by as much as 18 degrees in a mere 20 years. - There have been roughly 142 mass extinctions since life on earth began 3.85 billion years ago. Where did these come from? Nature. There weren't any human capitalists, industrialists, or cultures of consumerism to blame for it. -As a result of maturation, the sun is 43% warmer today than it was 4.5 billion years ago when the earth was just gathered itself into planetesimals. - It was much warmer in the Medieval Climate Optimum 1,000 years ago. - We're only temporarily putting C02 into the air - Man produces about 8 gigatons of C02 annually, compared to the 40,000 gigatons naturally there.

I'm just going to assume english isn't your first language? I think that would have been easier to say.¬† The more important question is, why do you and millions of other people continue to deny the overwhelming evidence supporting man made global warming? The science is in, 97% of climate scientists around the world agree there is a direct correlation between human activity and global warming. It's really not that hard a concept to grasp. CO2 increases temperature. Cars, power plants, cattle all omit huge amounts of it. *YES* the earth omits a lot more CO2 than we do, *YES* the climate has changed before. But it has never increased this quickly before. This slight increase, has gone from 350ppm (parts per million) to 450ppm - which sounds inconsequential but has potential to be catastrophic.¬† We aren't going to see these changes straight away, there is a natural feedback system in our oceans that mightn't show us the acidification and sea level rise for a couple more decades. if you're alive in 50 years time, you are going to see we'll be living in a *very* different world. You think war, famine, poverty and refugees are bad now? Wait until thats coupled with the disastrous weather patterns and sea level rise. We are pretty much fucked.

Luckily the weather, the environment, habitats and continents changed, because a static world where everything is equal always, only ensure the death of all life. So, life is change, transformation and especially death: without death life is impossible ... a few others will arrive, others go... is the life-cycle of the universe and that's good (and necessary)! So, it should be! and we can not pretend that all (individuals or species) remain immutable and eternal ... that's unnatural! Climate change has made the planet what it is ... If we want things never change, we favor only the extinction of life itself. We must minimize and hopefully stop pollution? Of course! But who must give strong and decisive step? The industries: they are producing garbage... no matter if all we stop littering the street, but the industry did not start using massively and only biodegradable materials, then any individual awareness campaign will fizzle! The industry should stop producing garbage and nonbiodeg-waste and so consumers do not shoot back to the street or the ocean! But even more important is that the scientific developments and technologies able to generate materials clean up what we have fouled: only science and technology allow repair the damage we have done in 300 years or more.

Another time, we were in an ice age. Now we are mild and in a drought in a lot of places. The earth is warming up apparently. It&#39;s not entirely mankind&#39;s fault. Just because we reduce carbon emissions, doesn&#39;t mean the earth will stop warming. It will just slow it down, but the inevitable is still coming.

The 5% of the population that are vegetarians for religious or moral reasons can boycott all meat if they want, but it doesn't help much. If you want to help, simply change your message from boycotting all animal products to a message where you encourage people to boycott all industrial produced animal products and replace them with properly managed animal foods. That will help a lot more.	UC60KmqgvHWDmn4R_tajRSnA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC60KmqgvHWDmn4R_tajRSnA	1	Ugi4XDhfgGJV2XgCoAEC	Harun Naeb

By the way what intelligent person moderates a carcinocenic compound in their diet? Why limit being healthy when it benefits you more than feeling junky? Our body is not built to digest meat, why do you think it takes up to 12-24 hours to pass it out of our digestive tract compared to plants which take up to an hour, because its "unnatural". Meat can be digested for survival, a survival need is not the same as a biological requirement. We are completely herbivorous by anatomy, if you don't believe me check the way you chew your food. If you make lateral movements with you lower jaw you are a herbivore, if you are an omnivore/carnivore you use horizontal movements to rip and tear at your food and no chewing happens just vertical chop and swallowing of it.

How did the cow get its protein? It's vitamin B12? It's calcium? It ate plants. So why are you filtering your nutrients through another being? Instead of feeding plants to a cow, just eat the plants to begin with. It's cheaper and more economical. Removing meat is not only wise, it's one of the healthiest decisions you can make. No one is spewing "bs" by saying otherwise. You're just hearing it that way. Why, I don't know.

I don't mind having a good debate about this all but now you're just throwing logical fallacies at me. You've basically argued every convoluted justification under the sun to support eating animals without just saying 'hey do you know what -what we do to animals is horrifying and cruel and massively damaging to the environment i may as well stop supporting that industry because i do actually love animals and i'm in a position where i can go vegan and so are many many other people.' ¬†Eskimos may be killing animals for survival but we're just doing it for gluttony. For the sake of our animals and our planet bear witness to one of the most destructive industries on this earth. The one that causes without doubt the most pain, the most suffering, the most habitat destruction, the most GHG. ¬†Watch Cowspiracy, Earthlings, Forks Over Knives, Gary Yourosfky's speech, look at footage of slaughterhouses.

It takes 616 gallons of water to make one meat patty and the bun takes 22 gallons - that's a ridiculous difference. Livestock farming uses massive amounts of water, it also pollutes water because of the run-off from the farms ( you can literally see it on google maps) massive amounts of water is also used to grow the crops we feed to them - so we pollute water and waste food and water to raise animals for food we didn't need. ¬†A vegan living in a city does more good than a non vegan living in that city. ¬†Locally sourced products is always going to be better than imported products but i promote veganism mainly for the animals - a benefit of not breeding, enslaving and murdering animals is that it helps take a massive toll off the environment. It is not justifiable or morally acceptable to hurt animals for food we don't need. Unfortunately it also hurts the environment too.¬† We can't justify this any more. The easiest kindest most effective thing to do is to go vegan.	UC64bGq6p59vSgvKqTZrpjSA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC64bGq6p59vSgvKqTZrpjSA	1	Ugi4XDhfgGJV2XgCoAEC	Harun Naeb

If we'd still be living in the palaeolithic age, you're point would actually be valid because humans would've been a natural part of the ecosystem. Our current way of farming animals is, however, industrialized, unless you live in a developing country. There barely are any sustainable animal farms. Why, you might ask? Because our society is driven by consumerism. The more, the faster, the cheaper, the better. The majority would rather buy a pound of industrially raised beef for $4.99 rather than a pound of "sustainably" raised beef for $10.99. Another aspect to consider is our general diet habit of consuming animal products for breakfast, lunch and dinner. That kind of habit is not sustainable in any way. Sure, if you only eat an once of steak for dinner, for example, and stay plant-based for the rest of the day, that might be considered "sustainable". But again, you'd have to take the grain that you'd have to feed to the livestock into consideration. That grain could again be used first-handedly rather than filtering it through livestock that generates methane and accelerates global warming.

But honestly even if you just meant man-made CO2 with for example fossil energy, I'm not quite sure what you are trying to say. There isn't even a slightest possibility that, on what stage our civilization is, to just stop our CO2 emissions. And even if we could, there's still this thing with the greenhouse effect, because CO2 is just causing another problem, not itself raising the temperature but to captivate the UV radiation and until this "layer" of CO2 we have in our atmosphere dissolves, time as to pass and actually even then it wouldn't endanger us because we anyway have and need a specific amount of CO2.

Other omnivorous animals could, and probably are, eating as much meat as us, but because they are animals they are allowed to. @Harun Naeb¬†I do agree that if we overkill all the animals for our enjoyment or sport, that's not right. This also counts for taking away too much land that animals live in for nothing. But the smart humans kill animals to eat and/or get resources that'll help us. If we don't help the other predators by keeping the amount of animals the right amount, animals like chickens and deer would overpopulate more and more, then most of them would starve to death because of the massive amount of resources THEY took, too. Making huge farms just for food is a territory I don't wanna go into, but overpopulation is what I'm focusing on, and we need to kill a few animals ourselves to help our earth.¬†If there were no predators to kill the deer, they would take away all the resources and grass from everywhere, soon taking so much they would doom their own species. Even if there were animals like lions and such, it wouldn't be enough. Hope you know where I'm going at.

Eating animals is morally wrong when we live in a world where we don't need them to thrive and survive. Not eating them and their by-products is also the most effective way of reducing GHG emissions. If one thing can help save the planet, can help reduce mass animal suffering, can help improve people's health, can reduce the cost of our food bills - then that's the best, easiest option we have because not many people can go off and live on an island and cause no harm at all.

Es ist ein Fakt, dass die industrielle Tierhaltung weltweit den gr√∂√üten Beitrag zur Erderw√§rmung leistet, da f√ºr die Viehhaltung (vor Allem bezogen auf die USA) hektarweise (Regen-)W√§lder abgeholzt werden, die den Klimawandel regulieren. Diese Fl√§chen werden sowohl zum Futteranbau, als auch als Weidefl√§che benutzt. Die Tonnen von Getreide, die als Futter angebaut werden, k√∂nnten den weltweiten Hunger stoppen und dementsprechend m√∂gliche Kriege um Nahrung verhindern.

Just to get that clear. And here it's not about the ethical reason, because I know that something you can endlessly argue about. Here it's about the environmental aspect, because as you may already read before, it's the industrially livestock that causes on of the leading global warming problems. Besides the fact that, especially cows, produce a lot of methane which is way worse that CO2, it also uses a huge (a really really huge!) amount of water, it also increases the deforestation because besides the huge amount of land animals in general need the also need even more food, especially the cheap soya. And to be honest I can go on and on. And going vegan is indeed very radical but each of us should face their own eating habits and try to reduce them to a comfortable level of consuming animal products.

Nitrous oxide is the most harmful compound to the ozone, by the way. It produces nitric oxide when reacted with radiaton in the atmosphere, and it disseminates ozone. Carbon dioxide and methane are large molecules. They don't disseminate it, they just keep radiation (light and heat) from escaping.

Do your research, watch Cowspiracy on netflix, watch Earthlings on youtube, just educate yourself on the environmental impacts of animal agriculture by googling it or typing it into youtube and then actually ask yourself if you think eating meat is a sustainable or ethically sound way to live	UC4XfSU2IIRX3uymCWmbY5Zw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4XfSU2IIRX3uymCWmbY5Zw	1	UgjzWw98AV2cnHgCoAEC	Tamar Hope

I thought this was clear for most people, but after viewing this comment section, it turns out, at many parts of the globe, there is a huge proportion of people who are uneducated in this matter.

We &quot;developed&quot; nations need to lead the charge towards energy efficiently (forcing developing nations into a strict plan may limit their growth and prosperity, and it&#39;s not just because Europe and America exploited the world for centuries to get where we are today). We have the resources and the duty to keep the world healthy.	UCnLio18iw75fDl83kXUMIQQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnLio18iw75fDl83kXUMIQQ	0

UgizeDmirexebHgCoAEC.86uYaJNJhKs86v5U45UjXR		1	2015-11-24 00:00:50	Janice from Accounting	+TestedModz Thats a misconception. Climate Change might not hit us full force for another couple of decades, probably even a century, but when it hits it will be unlike anything mankind has ever experienced. An now is the time for us to act. Its already to late to avoid all the negative effect, but acting now will buy us time and time is the main issue here. When you have to relocate hundreds of millions, or even billions of people because of rising sea levels it will matter whether you'll have to do that within one decade or four dacades. Right now the world is aching because of a few million refugees from north africa. What will happen when we have a thousand times as many all over the world while at the same time our food and fresh water supply will collapse because of shifting climate zones? WW1 and WW2 would be pieces of cake compared to the suffering climate change will cause. I think future generations will look back at our generation in disbelieve over our tremendous stupidity, short-sightedness and selfishness. Future generations will view todays politicians who are bought by oil, gas, coal and other corporations and deny science to block action on climate change, like we view Hitler and Stalin today. Pure evil. So no, I don't think there is anything that needs more attention than climate change right now. Unfortunately many things get more attention.

Climate is supossed to change (colder) in next 50 years. &quot;Decrease emission&quot;- Okay, but you don&#39;t seem to know what this means. How do you want to decrease emission? You will say &quot;Stop producing CO2&quot; - okay ,but where i&#39;m supposed to take that energy from ? renewable sources ? I will simply tell you what this means. It&#39;s only the possibile gate for big companies and UE. Even though those companies will create emisssion in order to keep production high ,which of course happens because other countries are forced to decrease emission. The only ones that cares about CO2 emission is. UE (Germany ) - Germany because they have some stock piles of &quot;renewable sources&quot;- devices. Asia and ESPECIALLY USA (where google came from) don&#39;t even tend to care with their 30L diesel engines. What that &quot;Warm bla bla&quot; does ? Nothing but $$$ to the companies that are producing those devices , it&#39;s only pretext to destroy economy of country that bases on coal etc..

Luckily the weather, the environment, habitats and continents changed, because a static world where everything is equal always, only ensure the death of all life. So, life is change, transformation and especially death: without death life is impossible ... a few others will arrive, others go... is the life-cycle of the universe and that's good (and necessary)! So, it should be! and we can not pretend that all (individuals or species) remain immutable and eternal ... that's unnatural! Climate change has made the planet what it is ... If we want things never change, we favor only the extinction of life itself. We must minimize and hopefully stop pollution? Of course! But those who must give strong and decisive step? The industries: they are producing garbage... no matter if all we stop littering the street, but the industry did not start using massively and only biodegradable materials, then any individual awareness campaign will fizzle! The industry should stop producing garbage and nonbiodeg-waste and so consumers do not shoot back to the street or the ocean! But even more important is that the scientific developments and technologies able to generate materials clean up what we have fouled: only science and technology allow repair the damage we have done in 300 years or more.

I doubt this whole climate change narrative very much and so should you if you are legit... I am very skeptical when it comes to google in general and to all those wannabe philanthropists like Soros, Richard Branson, Ted Turner, etc. who spend billions to allegedly stop climate change while they manipulate us (like Ted Turner does with CNN...) to fight wars in the middle east or to accept mass immigration in Europe (with Soros who pushes for much more mass immigration in german newspapers while my home country Germany already received about 130.000 immigrants within the first 3 weeks of this November 2015 only....). I guess what I want to say is to not trust the elites and the big corporations who manipulate and harm us all the time... Why sould they be really concerned about us and our planet this time? They could have shown their love for us and for mother earth before on various occasions and ydid just the opposite... Also NASA satellites already showed that there is less heat staying in the atmosphere than alarmist UN predictions wanted to make us believe during the last years... We gotta stay skeptical or we will fall for another elitist lie!	UC6onulOij16EfQPTY4PFHfg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6onulOij16EfQPTY4PFHfg	1	Ugi8CAPTGDsvyngCoAEC	Hey Nadine

Yes the climate has always changed on the planet and has shifted extremes multiple times, and will continue to do so long after humans are dead, if it isn't destroyed by something before then. However when discussing climate change, as is brought up in media conversations, or this particular video, they mean the effect that humans have on the shift in climate. Humans are pumping out gigatons of carbon dioxide alone, that's not including methane, or any other greenhouse gas that we produce. It's not a question of if we have an effect on the climate, at least not to those who actually understand the scope of human endeavor and the physics at work. Humans are speeding up the process and by extension laying down the path that future generations will be forced down, not just our species, but every other that inhabits this planet as well.

UghxNR_291Z-dXgCoAEC	2	2	2015-11-23 18:42:24	Anderson T	Global warming is happening, it&#39;s a fact. Having campaigns like this one is good. But acting holier-than-thou about it, like a lot of environmentalists out there, is just ridiculous. Where do you think the very keyboard you&#39;re typing came from? It&#39;s made out of plastic produced by a toxic waste shitting giant, it&#39;s transported in mass by evil CO2 chugging trucks to a store that will ship it to you using a CO2 pumping cargo plane. And that&#39;s basically everything we consume, the clothes we wear, the food we eat, the computers we watch these kinds of videos.<br />People also tend to forget that fighting against global warming has an effect on other people as well. While you are sitting comfortably in your PC chair, the farmer in Uganda and his children are dying of starvation because the gas prices went up after the whole global warming taxes bullshit and now he can&#39;t run his old tractor, or use his truck to transport his goods to the nearby town.<br />Same problem goes with animals rights. Yeah animal testing is borderline torture and really hard to watch, but what about people with diabetes? insulin and a whole lot of other essential drugs we use are products of these tests, what if your son had lymphoblastic leukemia? The survival rate used to be 4%, but after years of research and animal testing that number has gone up to 80%. Does that mean St. Jude&#39;s children&#39;s research hospital is an evil corporation? Would you rather let your son die of cancer because you feel bad for the little critters?<br />Environmentalism is a good thing, it might save our planet one day, but like most things, there are many sides to it.

As far as I know, the world is indeed getting hotter and hotter, problem is we don't know for sure what's causing it and even whether we can do something to stop it. Some scientists believe most of CO2 production is a result of all of our undersea volcanoes, some say that's only a fraction of the gases we humans produce, some say cow farts account for most of CO2 production in the world, and they all offer reasonable evidences.¬† You're right about Al Gore though, he's been pushing this crap down our throats from his high horse for a long time, I think the theory itself was born in the 70s if I'm not mistaken.

If that&#39;s not a consensus, nothing is. Denying climate change, and the part we play in it, puts you in the same camp with creationists and anti-vaccers.

The system before our emissions was relatively equilibrious - or in other words - the amount of CO2 consumed and emitted was roughly the same, which lead to temperatures rising and falling in a pattern. Our 'small' effect(which isn't so small after 200 years of industry) breaks this equilibrium & eventually, results in human caused climate change.

Just because the bible says that a disaster will come doesn't mean that it has to be this one and that we have to just sit here, what if it meant another disaster in a 1000 years? Also if this is that disaster, it'll come regardless of our actions so you don't have to fuss over it on the internet. Also atheists are against religion in general so I can't be an atheist.

I live in the UK and the largest power station here is Drax which is a coal station so it produces a lot of pollution but it also makes 4000 MW of energy, one wind turbine makes unto 7 MW of energy if it has optimal wind conditions which it rarely has. To replace Drax with wind turbines you would need 572 of them and that is only 7% of the energy that the UK uses so you would need a total of 8163 offshore wind turbines which uses up an immense amount of materials and money so currently switching to green power is not a very viable option	UCkCT_rh2yBQ_f9ILKxtdv1Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkCT_rh2yBQ_f9ILKxtdv1Q	0

If only people would actually stop and do some thinking on their own would realize the dimension of pure stupidity that other people are trying to get them into.<br />Why don&#39;t you do something useful for a change? Like petition for an international ban on arms exports. Or petition for a one central bank per country, no more international banks or other intermediary financial organizations. Then, both the people and the environment will truly be able to enjoy one another.	UCGL_iTBHZHY63vMlCE3XgtA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGL_iTBHZHY63vMlCE3XgtA	0

Either die in vain or don&#39;t be born. And now some of u might say so what if we try let us be then that&#39;s completely right and that makes this comment of mine pretty much completely useless in the matter of trying to make u think and i hope u did think about nothing and took some time to waste time cause that&#39;s what its 4 :3 kappa	UCu8cd7fbJA4TvUqVZEvOJXQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu8cd7fbJA4TvUqVZEvOJXQ	0

Destroy the objective meanings of words, and man cannot think (a gift of every pragmatist who ever lived). Destroy the ability to communicate clearly and the use of force is legitimized (a gift of public education and the MSM). Make individual action a sin, and all are enslaved to all (of every religion that ever existed). This was accomplished without firing a single shot or chopping off a single head.

Idk but would be cool though for people to realize that it might be a little suspicious that the ones who control big money and who financed wars and who manipulated the whole world during centuries - and who never were just a little bit transparent when it comes to their families wealth and fortune - now suddenly converted into the "saviours of the world" like the Rothschild family... Some might already know that David Mayer de Rothschild is highly engaged in the fight against so called global warming... He is presented as the elite's fighter against global warming just like millionaire Russel Brand (who already met the Queen...) is presented as the elite's controlled opposition leader against the (british) establishment....

However it is evident that a 1.6 degree C increase of global mean temperature over a 200 year span is highly unusual, and I recognize the evidence that this is because of an heightened greenhouse effect caused by an increase in CO2 levels which in turn is caused by human disruption of the CO2 cycle. Now, I'm curious, what is your view on this sudden increase of global mean temperature?

If not, there should be continent-large ice sheets from Ice Ages.<br />Additionally one volcano can emit CO2 equal to produced by human in a YEAR. And underwater volcanos erupt often.<br />Have you already forgotten that affair with leaked scientists&#39; mails? It was silenced so quickly...<br />Remember: more restrictions, more money needed.

As for the poles melting? NASA started doing surveys on the polar ice caps coverage via satellites in 1979. The problem with that, was the "threat" of the ice age in the 70s, which was after a cooling period, meaning the polar ice caps were pretty much at a record, so not really a good baseline to compare with. Nevertheless, the polar ice caps have been decreasing since then, until a couple of years ago, where it actually reversed (kind of how it reversed after the Ice Age threat in the 70s). And now, the polar ice caps are actually larger than they were in 1979.... In other words, the polar ice caps are not melting, they are in fact growing in size currently. When was the last time you heard the media talk about the melting polar ice caps? It's been pretty quiet about it for the last couple of years.

I specifically said Al Gore was more like an introduction, a way to comunicate the American people, not known by their high IQ or education, the state of things. There is sure to be found mistakes, but the poles are actually melting at a huge speed, so your point is not so valid. Besides, the documentary was actually released in 2006, and since then there have been international agreements against global warming that slowed down the trend until then.

UgixOdHNkHXLDXgCoAEC.86uSYIQfy--86uaeSDoklh		2	2015-11-23 19:22:46	Diego Call√©n	+James Sampson I honestly cannot believe how there is still people around who deny our responsibility on climate change. I will explain it as simply as I can so you can get he idea easily. If we look at graphs that show us the increasing of temperture overtime, taking as sources the analysis of tree growth rings, ice layers or plain written records, there is a clear increase of world wide temperature since the start of the Industrial Revolution in Europe, with an exponential rise of the curve. You might say that is a coincidence, that there might be a climate change due for this particular time. However that would be impossible, since climate takes centuries, even thusands of years to be modified, or it is due to certain specific events that haven't been observed recently, for example, the Small Ice Age (centuries XIV to XIX) was due to solar and volcanic activity. Besides, it is not only climate change we are talking about. The increase of CO2 is tightly bond with efects like acid rain, because of the chemicals delivered into the atmosphere thorugh burning; the whole world wide economy relies on coal and oil for every aspect of production: the more we use it, the more we need it, which creates a dependancy that only makes the problem worse. That's essentially the basics. If you want to learn more about it in a friendly and easy-to-get way, I would suggest watching Al Gore's "An inconvenient truth", a documentary that was specifically built in order to deliver this message clearly.

I think the reason that this "action" towards China, as the most industrialized country in the world is China, and if the "action" work, China very strongly suffers from this.

Whenever you ask the government to do something for¬†you it¬†comes with a lot of red tape and it usually has secondary consequences. The change should be with the people. Do you think that car manufacturer would keep making gas guzzlers if there was no demand for them. So instead of trying to force people to change (that&#39;s what the government does, they force change with guns) raise awareness and bring up compelling argument for people to want to change.¬† STOP FORCING THE CHANGE ON EVERYONE. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23constitution">#constitution</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ronpaul">#ronpaul</a>	UCljSus9T96IkTEti9SR8Szg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCljSus9T96IkTEti9SR8Szg	0

UggElHqrlrFdI3gCoAEC	0	0	2015-11-23 17:37:53	Josh Roundy	Climate change is real, But it is a lot less then what people think.<br />Just as an example: Venus is an earth like planet but with a crazy atmosphere comprised of over 95% CO2 because of that the greenhouse effect is insane there.<br />A long time ago earth had much more CO2 in its atmosphere and it was much hotter on earth, but then plants started taking the CO2 out of the atmosphere and putting it into the ground creating fossil fuels. If you burn those fossil fuels it releases CO2 into the atmosphere therefore increasing the greenhouse effect raising the temperature. But it is impossible to raise the temperature to more then it was over a billion years ago because people cannot possibly dig up all the fossil fuels in the world.<br /><br />I think it is a problem but its a low priority one.<br />The main problem i see is that it is more expensive in the long run to keep using fossil fuels because they will keep getting rarer and more expensive.<br />And even now, for the average person its cheaper in 5 years to install solar panels then to stick to the grid.<br /><br />Those are just my opinions and a few facts :)<br />ty 4 reading.

They'll just do anything an entertainment company says just because it's an entertainment company that they get their entertainment from. This is a regulations act. Regulations are terrible for economies, especially if the science is unsound or if another country, say CHINA is not willing to give up their polluting behaviors.

Lying=propaganda was made legal in 2012, so the gov and anyone can lie to you to brainwash you into believing anything they want you to believe. Good luck.

Ugg0jLHalZZpSHgCoAEC	29	1	2015-11-23 17:27:56	Saketh B	300 million people live in the dark in India. Our emission per capita is 1.7. The USA has 17.0. The west broke the world. Don&#39;t expect us to fix it. Our people will not live in the dark to let you guys ride your SUVs. We will work towards the world having the same per capita emission and the same standards of living. Let the west reduce their per capita emission drastically. Global warming is a pressing issue. Instead of solving it, the west is looking to offload the responsibilities to growing economies. The west will have to take more responsibility because they broke the world.

Expecting India to try to reduce emissions when we are at such a low base is unfair. No country wants to reduce emissions because that either leads to a lower standard of living or higher spending. So inevitably the weaker countries end up getting more responsibility than they should be taking up. That is the point I'm making.

Its primarily the sun activity that decides the temperature on earth and the other planets in our solar system. Since the beginning of time earth has gone through ice ages and warmth periods - long before the industrial revolution. <br /><br />Yes of course we should try to improve our technology to make it more green, and have less polution on earth to make the planet more healthy for us to live on. Nikolai Tesla&#39;s technology would seem like the best imo. <br /><br />My point is: RESIST ECOTAX, its nothing but a way for the elite to implement a global taxation based on a hoax, and in turn it can lead to a one world currency --&gt; NWO.

This doesn't necessarily change the fate of man though, as the rate of temperature increase being experienced at the moment still poses some serious threats in the not too distant future. Coupled with a ever-increasing population...who knows what could happen.	UCj_i33HmcDukbv83FsFaRHw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj_i33HmcDukbv83FsFaRHw	1	Ugg_Tzt3aG5LIngCoAEC	Nepul K

If you zoom in on a conveniently small period of time in which a temperature drop is being experienced, then of course you can claim temperature has dropped. But from 1880 to present day the planets temperature has been rising (see NASA's stats here: http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs_v3/Fig.A2.pdf ) Due to our increased carbon emissions during this same time period, it is not unreasonable to suggest that we are to blame for this temperature increase. Therefore it appears we have an opportunity to reverse these effects	UCj_i33HmcDukbv83FsFaRHw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj_i33HmcDukbv83FsFaRHw	1	Ugg_Tzt3aG5LIngCoAEC	Nepul K

No, me neither (and I'm french, with all the useless-taxes-clich√©s you know :D), so your theory is ridiculous. But the theory about how CO2 affects the environnement has been strongly demonstrated. We understands¬†only¬†a tiny¬†about our world, we can only make hypothesis and test them. So if you came with an amazing theory that destroys the global warming theory, I will maybe belive you, but for now I belive the global warming theory because it is the one that explain the best¬†how the earth is changing.

It`s hard to keep Earth healthy with 7 000 000 000 &#39;pigs&#39;. Low population - no problems (low temperature, rare animals would be in safe, low CO2 level, no forests killing, no oil in the Ocean). Only the big population is the problem. <br />You will change nothing with 7 billions crazy, ugly and very¬†hungry-angry¬†apes.

After that was over it got warm again. Remember when everyone was talking about the ozone hole? They stopped talking about it because it&#39;s been getting smaller. But that evidence wasn&#39;t pushed in the news because all these butthurt environmentalists didn&#39;t want to admit they were wrong and hoped everyone would just forget about it.

The most obvious solution would be to have countries invest more into clean energy. Typically, the infrastructure for these sorts of things have a very high initial cost, but can really start turning things around (e.g. more wind turbines, solar energy, etc.). Personally, my knowledge is mostly focused on reducing emissions in the aviation industry which can include developing unconventional aircraft designs that provide major reductions in fuel burn relative to current conventional aircraft (we really haven't seen anything novel in the last century.. and ultimately this is because it's risky for businesses to take on huge step changes). Other solutions in the aviation industry could involve looking into Biofuels and flow control technology to further this agenda. The common thread here is that countries need to invest more money towards this goal. Another key solution (which will likely be touched upon at the summit) is the implementation of a Carbon Emissions Cap and Trade system which forces every country to respect the amount of emissions coming from their industries. This would put a price tag on carbon emissions, which would really persuade businesses to take action and make their processes more green. Alternatively, developed countries are allowed to "trade" their emissions to developing countries by investing in greener infrastructure in developing countries instead (this could end up being less expensive for the developed country, but at the same time, help poor countries become more green). The end result? A greener international community. I hope this helps!	UC40nr0kUwZiUNYNMZASfTwQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC40nr0kUwZiUNYNMZASfTwQ	1	UggzPMb-n7elvHgCoAEC	Peter Nielsen

The reason we still use fossil fuels is because it's impossible to meet global energy demands with green energy alone and it's too dependent on variables making it unreliable. Just look at the Ivanpah solar power plant in Nevada. Last year they reported they were producing about half of the expected annual output and that's in a goddamn desert, how well do you think solar panels anywhere else will cope?

(My presidential candidate will do this) Take away oil subsidies and make new ones for green and renewable energy alternatives like Solar and Wind. There isn't much we can do to make things go back to the way they were, not for a while at least, but the least we could do is keep them from getting worse.

We are in a perpetual cycle roughly every 25,000 years. So while many are talking about global warming, you better enjoy it. The freeze is coming... North America will once again be under mile of ice, ocean water levels will drop 300 or so feet and parts of Antartica will once again be livable. So while we may be speeding this up, in reality we may bring this on 100 years sooner. But in the grand scale of things we are nothing more then a bug on a windshield..

This isn't some call for everyone to become vegan or vegetarian, It's a call to be more responsible with how much meat (and to a lesser degree dairy) we eat. Because we are letting the meat industry grow out of hand up to a point where it is actually contributing a very large portion of emission of greenhouse gasses. Like the video asks, lets try to be a little more responsible about how we live. You can actually do more than passively sign a petition: begin reducing pollution caused by human systems right now by simply reducing the amount of meat you eat somewhat. Imagine how much we could actually impact if everyone who signed this petition also cut their meat consumption by just a fourth for example!

Or maybe work on both aspects at the same time, though I think the problem we have are the people who A) try to tell everyone to be vegan B) refuse to accept that less meat is a good thing... The reason I put the people who tell everyone to be vegan first, is because they're the ones who will put people off of the idea of even reducing the amount of meat.

It's obvious that more animals are bred solely for meat than are being bred to restart the lactating period of cows. And I don't think we'd come even close to reducing meat consumption that far any time soon. So, primarily reducing population by reducing meat consumption, and maybe dairy products consumption as well would already have a huge impact on the amounts of emissions from agriculture. In the end we do need to keep certain amounts of livestock for various reasons, but a different balance in food consumption can have a huge impact on the world. Much more than the emissions of vehicles and power plants. (Not that that means that we shouldn't reduce those either..)

I've searched around and there is only one nutrient that's completely exclusive to meat, fish and dairy products (but that includes milk): vitamin B12. However, even that can be concentrated from other sources (it's difficult to consume it in proper amounts from those sources). Still, for many nutrients in meat (including fish and eggs), it is (one of) the most efficient way to consume them.. Anyway, there's another subject we haven't touched upon which is dairy products. If we are to reduce consumption of meat to reduce the impact livestock has on the environment we also ought to re-evaluate our consumption of dairy products ‚Äì although the impact of dairy products is much less than meat since one animal can produce much more milk as food than it can produce meat.

The amount of food livestock consumes is much less than the amount of food it provides, isn't that obvious?? I did mean humans as a predator with our tools included ;-) Plenty of animal population counts in various areas are actually being kept in check by human monitoring. Several areas are opened for hunting based upon this, and identified overpopulation are taken care of by specifically hunting and killing particular animals, or by introducing natural predators in the area. Anyway, it's pretty much undeniably clear that our meat consumption has a huge impact on the emission of greenhouse gasses, much more than other kinds of food. Reducing the amount of meat we eat will lower the total amount of emissions significantly. It's important not to forget this large source of emission harmful to the environment, as is it important to identify other significant sources of greenhouse emissions (¬†I just learned for example, that rice also contributes a significant amount to this as well, albeit far less than livestock. So it would be less effective to replace some of the meat we consume with rice :p)	UCVeS9i9TJIo0dlGUtlKkapg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVeS9i9TJIo0dlGUtlKkapg	1	UghZ0QtXykUJJ3gCoAEC	Critical

I'm sorry but this article actually has a conclusion against your claim... _"Here, we show that plants do not contain a known biochemical pathway to synthesize methane. However, under high UV stress conditions, there may be spontaneous breakdown of plant material, which releases methane."_ _"In addition, plants take up and transpire water containing dissolved methane, leading to the observation that methane is released."_ _"Together with a new analysis of global methane levels from satellite retrievals, we conclude that plants are not a major source of the global methane production."_ *Article 2* Rice is unique in that it's grown in flooded soil. The article specifically mentions this: _"Rice is grown in flooded fields, a situation that depletes the soil of oxygen. Soils that are anaerobic (lacking oxygen) allow the bacteria that produce methane from decomposing organic matter to thrive."_¬† Indeed, we are talking about Rice specifically and not at all "crops" in general! On top of that, the article references a pdf (www3.epa.gov/climatechange/Downloads/ghgemissions/US-GHG-Inventory-2012-Chapter-6-Agriculture.pdf) of an official report about various emissions from Agriculture.¬† On the first page we can find a summarising table of emissions throughout the years. Note that the rice comes in as third. Indeed a notable contributing factor. Now note that the first and second are "Enteric Fermentation" and "Manure Management".¬† Enteric Fermentation causes the production of gasses like methane in the digestive tracts of animals. In short those two entries are about emission of methane caused by livestock. Now, finally, note the actual numbers and what the ratio is between the emission caused by lifestock and the emission caused by rice. Interesting. It seems that indeed this article also opposes your claim. *Article 3* I begin to wonder if you have actually read any of these articles yourself. Here's again a direct quote from the article: _"It is not yet possible to assess the quantities of methane emitted from the sources that Frank Keppler and his colleagues have found in plants, fungi and possibly also animals. Consequently, it is also not yet clear what role these methane emissions play with regard to the climate."_ Obviously, this article does not support your claim at all. As they have no idea yet what the amounts of the emissions from this kind of sources are. Suffice it to say that it would be far less than emissions from lifestock which is easily measurable. There's also a link to "explore further" at the end of the article, which leads to an article covering earlier research that starts off with:¬† _"Plants store one greenhouse gas, but emit another. Whereas they bind carbon dioxide, they release methane - _*_albeit in small quantities._*_"_ (http://phys.org/news/2008-05-methane-sources.html#jCp) The article explains further that _"UV light boosts methane production"_ which allowed them to identify the slight quantities of methane produced from this process. All three of the articles you provided do not support, and even sometimes contradict your bold claim. Thank you very much for disproving your own claim. Next time do some actual research (and maybe read the articles before proposing them as evidence)..

Your assuming the gestation period is the highest factor in the increase in population. Like you said, animals in the wild breed as quickly as possible as a means of survival ‚Äì which implies the presence of a population controlling threat. With lifestock however, the threat is us humans, and we regulate that threat to increase the population before reducing it. This process causes the population to increase rather than stay largely the same as a result of natural threats. There are plenty of examples of animals that were released in areas where they did not have any natural predators which caused them to overpopulate the area.¬† _"What are we to do with them"_ Isn't that obvious? You can gradually decrease lifestock population over an amount of time. I am not suggesting we'd do away with meat production and consumption completely, rather decrease both drastically. Effectively we'd "increase the threat level" and lower the breeding opportunity for the livestock which would mean a gradual decrease in population. What I meant with that was that the amount of livestock we have is an unnaturally large population of animals. It is artificial (man made) overpopulation as opposed to natural overpopulation. What about humans as a large enough predator?	UCVeS9i9TJIo0dlGUtlKkapg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVeS9i9TJIo0dlGUtlKkapg	1	UghZ0QtXykUJJ3gCoAEC	Critical

I'm sure we breed them at the highest amount that their gestation period allows, which most animals do anyway as a way of surviving. I could be wrong, we could breed them faster than they gestate, but I'm pretty sure that's impossible. I don't think we'd let them loose, but what are we to do with them? Are you saying that we should just starve them? Or kill them prematurely? The idea of them surviving in "the wild" isn't too farfetched. Yes they won't get exactly the same nutrition as we feed them, but (here at least) we don't have any predators large enough to take down a cow, so they could actually survive. For a time. Also, if you read what I said I'm pretty sure I hinted towards it not being a possibility/option. As for understanding "how much of an artificial overpopulation the current amounts of livestock represent" I have no idea what that sentence even means.

If humans would eat less meat, we would require less lifestock to provide that meat.	UCVeS9i9TJIo0dlGUtlKkapg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVeS9i9TJIo0dlGUtlKkapg	1	UghZ0QtXykUJJ3gCoAEC	Critical

You&#39;ve got to know us by reality, crime, poverty, politicians here are in a paradise, steal the ignorant without knowledge &quot;they pretend to feed us, pretend to have the food, they pretend to educate us, pretend to have education&quot;, they are destroying even that is no longer enough to homeland soiled by corruption? this president is a tremendous disappointment.<br />want everyone to know that, I am Brazilian and ashamed for what happened in Rio Doce and it is affecting all the Southwest region, which borders the states of Minas Gerais and Espirito Santo. With around 853 km long, its course is the most important watershed and now only turned the toxic sludge.

The ice that is melting right now in south pole is less than 1000 years old. Studies show that CO2 has nothing to do with the temperature rise. GeoCraft: &quot;In the Ordovician Period 460 million years ago CO2 concentrations were 4400 ppm (380 ppm atm), while temperatures then were about the same as they are today.&quot; Just look back in history. At the same time, the mindset of defending the environment is very important. We got only one planet.	UCXpSBU-6HwvUt0JTbl0Hy0A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXpSBU-6HwvUt0JTbl0Hy0A	0

I&#39;m not denying climate change, because it&#39;s very real, but we should be really looking at other factors not just focusing on what we&#39;re doing. Yes we are consuming the earths resources at an alarming rate, and the right thing to do is not do that. We should be protecting our environment, but to be naive and think that we&#39;re the cause of global warming, and that changing our lifestyles drastically is going to make everything better, that&#39;s not going to happen. Yes we are accelerating climate change, but our effects on global temperature change are in the grand scheme of things, negligible. What we need to be doing is being responsible human beings, not taking advantage of natural resources, but if we really want to stop global extinction events caused by climate change we should really be spending a lot more money on space watch programs, and anti asteroid response programs.

It certainly is better than taxing.

Support rolling blackouts while stuffing the pockets of the worthless green energy companies who do nothing but waste money and spread propaganda. <br />Cost the country losses of trillions over a decade, all over .5 degrees C. <br />Hope it makes you feel super awesome and progressive, because it isn&#39;t going to make one bit of difference in the end. <br />Sheep.

I&#39;m not being sarcastic when I ask, is it really that hard to recycle and not leave electrical devices on/plugged in? While you&#39;re busy scoffing at someone putting a scratch sheet of paper in the recycling bin, do you think it&#39;s somehow serving some invisible corporation that found a way to profit from people&#39;s willingness to reuse things? I&#39;m just not hearing what the actual arguments are against being more aware of the environment. Are nay-sayers maybe too embarrassed to admit that it&#39;s just pure laziness? That maybe they&#39;ve come down with yet another case of the &quot;I-can&#39;t-be-bothered&quot; virus that is evermore catching. I&#39;d really like to see what&#39;s on the other side of this coin...	UCzkLQoUrz8FvJf-NvECchlQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzkLQoUrz8FvJf-NvECchlQ	0

Ughy1d34ZHfAcXgCoAEC	7	17	2015-11-23 17:02:32	Tyler Hurson	I don&#39;t know if humans are the primary cause of climate change, but I do know that the solution to climate change is not a bigger government. The fact that liberals seem to be so eager to use climate change as an excuse to grab political power makes me and many other Libertarians doubt the sincerity of the movement. If liberals really cared about climate change, why aren&#39;t they exploring the numerous private solutions that have come out in the recent decade? It seems that everyone wants to jump on the EPA/UN bandwagon-- even though these organizations have historically failed to do their job.<br /><br />Also, why is there never any discussion about the positive effects of climate change? None of this seems scientific to me.	UCYclyBbUvkHBuu1L2TuuKgA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYclyBbUvkHBuu1L2TuuKgA	0

The reason bigger government is needed to deal with this issue is because there is no way in hell the private industry will decide, by itself, to work towards a better ideal just for the sake of the planet. Essentially, we need both. In the long-term, we need innovation from the private sector in order to replace fossil fuels and work towards climate change solutions, but we also need the government to actively help in that process, by regulating emissions and providing incentives for the moral high ground. Of course there are numerous private solutions, and we do need innovative companies such as SolarCity, Tesla and Siemens, but in the end, we can't function with just one or the other.

Mine gets 5.5 L/100km on average and I only emit 20kg of CO2 a week. China on the other hand probably dumps thousands of metric tons from just one plant. All that this stupid deal will do is raise carbon taxes, and gas prices without actually fixing the problem. I believe climate change is real but stupid hashtags and carbon taxes aren&#39;t going to fix the problem.	UCrCcjjA4ccs--gxu5nDWu2A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrCcjjA4ccs--gxu5nDWu2A	0

Follow the money, it goes towards any revolution or war and then monopolizes their country following the collapse. The American robber barons of the early nineteenth-century are well documented and many still in immensely powerful positions today. A government change in energy management will simply change how this wealthy minority harnesses other power sources and monopolizes other industries.

This is because the "pus" comes from the root for "feet." Although, it really is a complicated matter, because it is a Latin variant. But the word traces down to Greek. In addition, all three are old, common, and correct enough to be accepted. But if you're going to rule one out (as the narrator did in this video) then you ought to use the most technically correct one. It's really just a bunch of people quibbling over a pointless matter to show erudite superiority, and I shamefully admit to have participated in it (as evidenced by my preceding comment), but then again, we are all in error by criticizing accepted usage of variants of the plural of "octopus." So, there you go! The more you know :P	UCirA7RufQWdL5FMtbQBeDyw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCirA7RufQWdL5FMtbQBeDyw	1	UgjkZURb682vQ3gCoAEC	MetaKnight68

Stupid scientists are blaming us for something that we cannot control nor prevent. Sign all the petitions you want, hell send Bruce Willis into space to fix it, none of you are changing jack. The climate is going through changes always, let it run its course. We can only adapt to it. I refuse to believe that humans wrecked it, or its impossible to fix itself. We are still young and the Earth is much much older than us. It survived asteroids, global floods, extreme temperatures, etc. I would be ashamed to add humans to that list. Don't waste your money or time on the politics of it, we are but a drop in the ocean calling for change. Don't matter how many of us support/disagree with it.

(btw coal and natural gas make up 37% of our total emission). Not only that but we have the technology ready now to use old waste as new fuel. (Terrawave, sodium cooled reactors, etc.) Solar and wind just can&#39;t do it all right away.	UC-58xHgKHWSoefNSG_qAvSQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-58xHgKHWSoefNSG_qAvSQ	0

My country is actually in war with the IS right now, and it keeps going on. That's something we should care about, war. We are destroying ourselves with war, not by global warming. And the ice caps do grow and melt once in a while. The melting of our ice caps is a very natural process. The Earth is not a dead planet that stays the same for centuries, changes do happen, everywhere in the universe, and it happens in many ways.

The human race may have a lot to lose from climate change, but big, greedy businesses have a &quot;lot to lose&quot; from stopping their mass production, fossil fuel burning, and everything else they do to cause climate change. You can say <i>&quot;let&#39;s change things!&quot;</i> as much as you like, but it&#39;s not like the people who this applies to haven&#39;t heard it before.<br /><br />The human race is a primarily selfish species. Unless they can see a reward that will benefit them personally, it&#39;s very unlikely that most people will make any significant change to their behavior. I&#39;ve said it before and I&#39;ll say it again, words change <i>absolutely nothing</i> no matter how idealistic and hopeful they may sound. Action is the only thing that people understand, and more often than not action leads to conflict. The planet earth may look like a beautiful blue marble, but it is, and has always been, the dwelling place of creatures whose unifying trait is that they tear apart those who are either weaker than them or stand in the way of something they want.<br /><br />What makes you think a comparatively small, upstart species like humanity will be able to stop billions of years of bestial tradition? Watch and see how the environmentalists continue to preach their message when the sky has turned green from all the smog, and the people STILL won&#39;t do anything about it, because again, words do absolutely nothing.<br /><br />I&#39;ve come to terms with the fact that most people are ignorant scumbags. That&#39;s why I&#39;m numb inside emotionally. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23This">#This</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23That">#That</a>, none of it matters in the end.<br /><br />You&#39;ll never save the earth. Mankind will learn its lesson the only way it ever does. The hard way.	UCzxHVJ0DiZY1AcnqC-zKC0g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzxHVJ0DiZY1AcnqC-zKC0g	0

Our society makes humans greedy! Everyday, everytime, in every single place someone looks, there is someone teaching us constantly how we should be better than others, how we should always compete with others for profit and for personal gain only, and how possessions make a man better, happier and more successful than others! That's what needs to change first, the society and its values! Then we will be able to save the environment, and only then.

OVer 200 power plants have been shut down in the US alone, replaced by cleaner forms of energy. I bet the several hundred thousand families that were turned upside-down by throwing the bread-winner out on the street would disagree that &quot;nothing is being done&quot; CO2 emissions have been trending down since 2006 because of this, and changes to automobiles, more efficient and environmentally friendly engines, more efficient power plants and environmental controls, improvements in efficiency of appliances, etc etc etc. But, keep being a sheep and parroting that good old &quot;doing nothing&quot; crap since it makes you feel better than other people. You&#39;re just as bad as all the idiot social justice warriors ruining the college education system across the country. Ever actually READ the studies on global warming/climate change? Do you know 66 percent of the papers done on the subject did not conclude that humans cause it? Those were conveniently thrown out in order to give the misleading 97 percent figure that the sheep always talk about. Of those 97 percent, less than 10 percent suggest that taking drastic measures such as Obamas dictator-like executive order is a good idea and will produce worthwhile changes. On the other hand, this order will have massive negative impacts on the economy, spike unemployment causing millions of job losses, increase the poverty rate of people who can already not afford their utilities. I am sure the liberals will try to simply increase the taxes on the middle class in order to attempt to cover the large increases in energy cost. In some areas, there will even be rolling blackouts. We are already doing something, a LOT actually, but it doesn&#39;t fit the idiot agenda to mention how much we have accomplished. It&#39;s just cool to talk gloom and doom. Coal plants are being shut down as they are replaced by cleaner forms of energy. This would continue on, as it has been, and the Earth will be fine. Instead, Obama has to get out his Stalin-pen and force us into some knee-jerk drastic attack on the power industry and economy, just so a bunch of progressive liberal environmental SJW&#39;s can feel cool and hip.

Even a child knows that actions speak louder than words, but words can make people act. The power of words will unite people, and then when united, they can act. How they will act, where, when, and all of that is irrelevant. My point is only that words are powerful. They can take life away, and they can save life.

No doubt there is climate change, I don&#39;t deny the evidence what I am saying, is how can we save the planet when we can&#39;t save ourselves. Im tired of these self Righteous white bourgeoisie environmentalists. They don&#39;t care about the planet, not in the abstract they don&#39;t they only care about a clean place to live, their own habitat, the title of the video says it all. Narrow minded self interest doesn&#39;t impress me. The planet will go on, its us that will go away. Only the truth of life can turn this world right side up, its the only thing that can unite mankind and transform mankind and the world when enough people see it. This is truth you can and should check for yourself. Google <b><i>Truth Contest</i></b> and read the top entry. Nothing could be more important or worthwhile than checking the truth for yourself, we need to change ourselves before we can go any further. We need to change ourselves now just to survive.

That when people do stuff they don't plan things? Even tho EVERYTIME we consider starting human activities in a place we study everything (If you ever bought a house, you also know that you will have details about weather, soil, etc)? That humans lived without being cautious this whole time? That territories gestion and management isn't a real thing and that people who work there actually don't do anything? What do you think most geologists and such are doing at work? Just lie saying that this is happening, that this isn't etc just for money? You seriously think it is nothing but a big conspiracy to get people to pay more for no reason? And don't you think even ONE second something this big cannot happen since all of this is fact? And you think we should just abandon trying to survive because dying tomorrow or in a thousand years do not matter? Are you even a human or just some extra-terrestrial lifeform that happened to be there, not having any knowledge of our world?

Without the truth there can be no real morality, justice, equality, unity, success, freedom, love, security, peace, or even survival. The truth is the only thing that can unite everyone, it is what we all have in common, and that will never change. Everyone eats, breaths, is born, and dies, ETC. The ultimate truth is universal truth. For the first time we can know the truth about life and death, the difference between knowing and not knowing is checking. If you care enough about the truth to check what it is you will know the truth. If you don't you won't and you will be lost and deserve to be.

We need to have multiple ways to fuel our vehicles, homes and city&#39;s. Also I talked to my uncle who is a rocket scientist for the US Navy. And I asked him if it was somehow possible to reverse global warming or slow it down. I know it is a crazy idea but I feel it is something that should be researched more. He said it would be possible to make some sort of weather balloon with a carbon dioxide filter attached to it. But he said it would be difficult to make something like that.

UghpE7yt0AEfr3gCoAEC	0	0	2015-11-23 16:30:11	Michael Black	Daily reminder global warming is a scam designed to capture guilt about our first world high quality of life and funnel it into taxes and power for the NGOs and the permanent civil service machine. Yes, long term temperatures are EXTREMELY SLOWLY rising, even though temperatures have stayed static since the 90s (they tell us the heat is going into the ocean..) but the extent to which man is involved is negligible. The Medieval Warm Period had higher averages in summer than we do today and I don&#39;t remember them using any industrial fossil fuels. Almost everything you will ever hear about AGW is propaganda created by self-interested and highly corrupt dominant bureaucratic public relations agencies like the IPCC. Do not trust anyone, not even this post. Look into it yourselves and check out the Heartland Institute too if you have to.

The IPCC is a criminal organisation. The proof is out there, but you have to want to see it. Your Climatology Church is a new dangerous religion. NO, the earth is not flat. NO, the sun does not revolve around the earth. NO, the earth is not the centre of our universe. YES, man has no influence whatsoever on climate. CO2 is NOT a pollutant, it is life breath for plants. If all, we need at least 5x more CO2 in the air to make crops grow better and bigger, so we can eliminate hunger.<br /><br />Water vapour is 6 times stronger than CO2 as a greenhouse gas and 2000 times more present. Why are the IPCC models not including water vapour as a greenhouse gas? You are all being lied to. All graphs you rely on were not represented completely. The only one who has become very wealthy is AL Gore with his trade in Emission Rights. Keep on being stupid. Yes your kids will pay for your mistakes. Don&#39;t believe me, believe Dr. Patrick Moore, Founder of Greenpeace.	UCns4L3RQqQeqn1S2KpKBSjg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCns4L3RQqQeqn1S2KpKBSjg	0

The graph clearly shows, global ice coverage hasn't changed in AT ALL on a noticable scale, yet global warming hoaxers keep yapping about how ice caps are melting. So how are the 2 possible at same time? How can ice caps melt, but global ice constantly return to the same coverage? >it is way too fast for it to be natural.

You don't even understand that you're basing your own view on the wrong things. Coverage= more *surface* Coverage=/= more =volume* Global= on the planet's scale Globe=/= detailed and precise results giving details about everywhere which is needed to understand the phenomenon and study it. And yes, an Ice Age might be coming, but if you ever watched the big science talks about global warming by just typing it on the net/youtube, you'd know what comes off is that it skyrocketed when Humans became to pollute as hell, and that the numbers say it themselves: it is way too fast for it to be natural.

Yes the Paris meeting might change some things and prevent new projects that could be to damaging ( like the big pipeline project in Canada). But these might only be small changes that wont circumvent what is to come. The things that are already there will be more hard to change and the toughest to change will be the whole world with it&#39;s energy using and massive waste creation all fueled by money. And until something truly catastrophic happens in many countries, not much will change that since billions of people depend on that system to live.

I would be fine without meat because i have a weakness towards all that is fruit. I'm just saying health risks won't make people more reluctant towards consuming meat. People will rather wait for a cure of all meat induced diseases and gamble on the hope that they won't be the ones to get those diseases. Honestly even though i don't eat that much meat i would still feel a bit robbed by the lack of it. And if i get this feeling then the average Joe will be absolutely furious.

China gives no flying fucks about their emissions or what impact is has on the earth. All they care about are profit, competition, and economic gain.<br />People who keep posting videos like this, direct your complaints at China. Until they change, the progress of stopping global warming is insurmountable.	UC9hjB1cJNYm7cw2ZaxGh9eg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9hjB1cJNYm7cw2ZaxGh9eg	0

La Terre a connu des r√©chauffements bien plus importants par le pass√©. La hausse de temp√©rature enregistr√©e depuis un si√®cle n&#39;est que minime compar√©e √† la croissance de l&#39;activit√© industrielle. L&#39;augmentation du CO2 a un effet b√©n√©fique que peu de gens savent : cela a augment√© de 15 √† 20% le rendement agricole; ce qui permet √† des millions de personnes de pouvoir manger. Pendant que tout le monde pleure √† cause de la fonte des glaces en Arctique la banquise en Antarctique s&#39;agrandit de jour en jour et de mani√®re beaucoup plus significative que la fonte au Nord.

Sometimes those weather patterns will bring cooler air to some areas. And in the Antarctic, where sea ice circles the continent and covers such a large area, it doesn‚Äôt take that much additional ice extent to set a new record. that was in your own link, learn to read dipshit ‚ÄúThe planet as a whole is doing what was expected in terms of warming. Sea ice as a whole is decreasing as expected, but just like with global warming, not every location with sea ice will have a downward trend in ice extent,‚Äù Parkinson said. there is another direct quote from your link	UCT2e9P8SEe85tLyXM8LCcXg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT2e9P8SEe85tLyXM8LCcXg	1	UgjHOuMBrGoKu3gCoAEC	ChooChoosGaming

There are a lot of studies showing that because of all of this we're lucky if humans can survive the upcoming 100 years. We talk a lot about this in school cause it's really important for our future. You can google it and i promise you will be surprised over how serious it already is. Just make sure that it's trustworthy sources, there are a lot of people who refuse to believe what's really happening.

You know what else has 10 in it? The illuminati. Mr.perfect is an illuminati agent confirm. But let's dig deeper. I've read your message and I've really decode it! Gaining more ice. Gaining is a 7 letter word. 10 - 7 = 3. Ice is a 3 letter word. 3. What also is a 3 letter word? War. War never changes. George Bush declared war against iran and Iraq. 4 - 3 = 1. But 1 is a number.

In fact humans, back in time when they were hunters and gatherers, ate much less meat, than we do in our industrial nations right now. The meat industry is the largest producer of greenhouse gases. So if we could reduce our meat consumtion, it would be a big step into the right direction.

I am an omnivore because that is what Humans evolved to be. I do not discriminate against vegetarianism or veganism, however I will not follow it out of personal belief. Signing the petition will make an impact on Global warming if the world leaders come to an agreement. However, non of this is particularly important, Yellowstone National Park is a Super Volcano due for eruption. There's a large possibility that it will erupt in the next 100 years, leading to a Volcanic Winter and even more CO2 in the atmosphere. Back to eating meat. While it has become industrialised in many ways, it is still more natural for Humans to eat meat, once again I will have nothing against you if you do not eat meat, I DO have something against you if you try to convert others to your diet. All the meat I buy is from a local source.	UCl_HD-BiVNDlDcMyvtoJd2A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl_HD-BiVNDlDcMyvtoJd2A	1	Uggw-FZiJNglpngCoAEC	Surov√° Dc√©rka
