And you'd be surprised that there is a sound explaination for it. Hint: it has to do with the tilt of rotation axis of the earth and ice's abillity to serve as a reservoir of CFCs and release them back in huge amounts if melted again.

In science, you put forth a theory, such as agw. In order for the theory to be accepted, it can have no holes. AGW has tons of holes. I do not have to prove that real life is real, you have to prove the alternative is real. Look up dead zone and fertilizers and you will find the evidence that they have known the cause and effect for over a century. You push the theory that reefs are dying due to co2, but rather than prove it, you demand that I prove they are not. You push a theory that acidfication is killing fish, but rather than prove it, you demand I prove they are not. That is not science, that is religion.

The scientist that say the fish are not dying from co2 use lab test to show how they fish are actually dying. People like you say the correlation is more important than actual lab test.

IT was proven that half the damage done to the reefs was from eco terrorist dumping oil on the reefs to make it look like they were dying. The truth is, the corals are recovering after measures were put in place to stop the dumping of waste in the rivers upstream of the reefs. IF co2 is causing the shellfish to die, how did it do so 100 years ago. Shellfish were dying in the 1920's due to waste and fertilizer being dumped into rivers and that is still happening now. It is a proven fact that none of the shellfish have ever been proven by labs to have been killed by co2. Same with turtles and just about any ocean animal you want to mention.

For example, let's say that a climate scientist believes the climate sensitivity for CO2 to be 1.3 degrees Celsius. Another climate scientist predicts the climate sensitivity for CO2 to be 4.5 degrees Celsius. If the predictions of the first scientist are right, then there will be a minimal effect on the climate and there's not much to worry about. If the predictions of the second scientist are right, there could be some issues. But the effects of this 4.5 degree Celsius change will take longer to arrive. So the climate alarmists constantly telling everyone that we have a climate emergency on our hands and that the globe will warm drastically and quickly is not mainstream science at all. It's just alarmist fear-mongering. In reality, the bigger the problem, the more time we have to adjust.

China emits about 1/4, which is way too much, but far from "mostly". If you take into account the fact that China has almost 1.4 billion people and the USA has 327 million people it becomes very apparent that the citizens of USA are responsible for a lot more carbon per person than China. In terms of total numbers, the USA emits 15% of the world's carbon emissions, which is a lot. For any other country than the two mentioned it is natural to point fingers at both China and USA. You're not exempt because you're second place. Second place isn't the end of the list, as if there's no other country than USA and China. You are still on top of the list. Regarding your other point: Here's an experiment for you. Take a pencil and balance it on your finger at the pencil's center of gravity. It's now in equilibrium. Now, apply a little bit of force on one side of the pencil. As you will see, the pencil falls off! "how can it fall of when 99.9% of the total forces on the pencil is the upward normal force and the force of gravity at the center of mass". You see, things are relative and the context always matter in physics. You probably have an intuition of it if you think about it.

" So first of all. When you say "they", which study are you talking about? I suspect that you are referring to one of the critiques of the 1998 Hockey stick graph by Pat Michaels. Which means you didn't read my comment before you commented. I'll cite my self: "The Hockey stick graph was a contentious issue in 1998 and the following years. That is, it was argued that the uncertainties for some of the time periods of the graph were too high for comfort. This is exactly how science works. Throw the hypothesis against the wall and try to break it. It is now 2020 and there have been over 20 studies since using various methodologies and additional proxy data. They all support the findings of the Hockey stick graph" An analogy to this would be to say "We don't know whether protons and neutrons are the smallest elements of the nucleus of an atom or not" by refering to a study from the 1920s, without saying that it's from the 1920s. The point is of course that research have moved along since the 1920s, and we know that protons and neutrons consist of up quarks, down quarks and gluons. It is no longer a contentious issue. One shouldn't pretend that knowledge and science hasn't advanced since the 1920s and is the same as today. While the 1920s analogy would of course be more fallacious, the same point applies for 1998. *******************************************************************' "Why do they lie about Polar bears and Walruses, when the evidence shows the opposite? " No idea, and I don't care enough to check :). Polar bears are not reliable indicators for a model assessing questions of physics. So I won't try to evaluate that claim. ******************************************************************* "Why is the Arctic and Greenland ice growing in size and depth, despite what GISS and these experts are telling us?" The overall ice is declining in the Arctic and Greenland. The overall ice in the world is declining. Isn't much more to say. You might have read some blog that cherrypicked data to make some conclusion which is not really implied by the whole data set. For example that there has in recent few years been a slower reduction in sea ice in the winter in the arctic, and thus concluding that there's no climate change. To point out the problem here, let me make an example "Even though it's early December, today's temperature in my home town was higher than yesterday's temperature, which was again higher than the day before yesterday. Thus I conclude that winter is neither coming to my town nor the whole northern hemisphere." Another cherrypicking claim circulating is that the arctic sea ice isn't declining because some minimum sea ice extent record (of 2007) hasn't been beaten yet. This is not how physical systems work. They don't follow a smooth monotonic curve. That said, the 2007 september record was beaten in 2012, and 2019 was almost on par with 2012. The September minimum ice extent trend for 1979–2011 declined by 12.0% per decade during 32 years. Winter maximum extents have also shrunk, but not as dramatically, although the ice pack is dramatically thinner than it used to be. The arctic has lost 66% of its average ice thickness since 1958. The trend is very much apparent, if you're not cherry picking that is. Another analogy: Say your friend bought some stocks in a firm at 100 dollars each. After having owned it for a year it is now just worth 50 dollars. It continues to fall and in month 13 it's worth 46 dollars, month 14 it falls rapidly to 34 dollars, month 15 it's at 45 dollars, month 16 it's at 43 dollar, month 17 it's at 40 dollars, month 18 it's at 37 dollars, month 19 it's at 35 dollars. Your friend tells you "The stock isn't falling! It has increased 1 dollar since month 14" Would you say that this is a good way of portraying the data? ***************************************************************** "Why has the tide not risen like any and all predictions have told us it would? The tide data and physical landmarks tell us otherwise." If you think about it. Measuring sea level change has to take into account the tides. Say you mark a point at low tide and high tide on a given day, every year. How would you measure a change in sea level without a change in low and/or high tide? You could of course mark it in between high and low tide(or make a range of marks), but if that point goes up it's pretty likely the others do more or less as well. If not it would mean the tidal distribution becomes more and more dominated by high tide, so you should probably have marks on high and low tide for a more conclusive result regarding sea level change. Hence you are measuring tides as well when you are measuring the sea level. This way of measuring sea level is of course difficult because tides(and the ocean in general) are very complex creatures and are dominated by a range of factors. If the tidal range changes in the area you are measuring because of some changes in currents or other oceanographic factors, then it may give you an impression of sea level rise while it's actually just a change in tides in that area. A solution is of course to do an average all over the planet(the water has to go somewhere), and doing that by the use of satellites. This is exactly what is done. Don't hesitate to link wherever you got this from, I'll gladly look at it.	UC-FT_1FWZyEYwtMmvAKHsbQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-FT_1FWZyEYwtMmvAKHsbQ	1	UgxdQpxn1AJBTpeA7l54AaABAg	Bill Annau

I believe its a lie just to fill pockets by buying out gasoline and oil overseas and not allowing it in America. Remember how expensive gas was during the Obama days? 8 years of it and what did we actually accomplish? Then trump does a 4 year term and we were getting our fuel in America so we dont have to rely on foreign countries N expensive price at their mercy. Its horrible and is going to make us non self reliant. I dont feel there's much we can really do but use what God made for us to use. ❤ 🙏 were in scary times right now and we americans need to meet in the middle regardless of political parties and take in factual information not just the opinion of others on the news made out to be the truth when its just a opinion.
