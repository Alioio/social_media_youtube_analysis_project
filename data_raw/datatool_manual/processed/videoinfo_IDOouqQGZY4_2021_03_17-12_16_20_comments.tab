If you went beyond your own self-imposed boundaries, you would be able to find the answers you're looking for. The area we discussed was the Australian regions of the wildfires. There are never any positive impacts too massive wildfires. So, of course, that discussion isn't positive. When we speak about the biggest impacts in our world, they are rarely positive. But, your right, there are areas in which the climate is having positive changes, but I guess it's all in your perspective. My area has gotten warmer. We no longer have harsh winters, and we get more rain than we normally have gotten in the past. To some, they love the change and see it as positive. For others, who like the cold winters, they don't see it as a positive. That's hardly news breaking headlines, so you don't see much of it and it's rarely talked about nationally. Just because you don't take the time to see it, doesn't mean it doesn't exist. It does. And your way off the mark on the 100 to 1000 lives. We are already seeing climate migrations as islands are sinking in the sea. Areas of Louisiana, already below sea level, have had whole towns flooded away. They have been forced to locate. It will get worse. Miami is in the midst of feeling the impact scientists have warned us about. And you may so little disregard for the lives of others impacted, but I bet the tune will change once it hits your front door. I really can't believe you're so flippant about the loss of human life. So I don't think you can understand the concept of why it's so important to save lives period. It's a waste of time trying to explain it to you.

Ugzn8HTk5Ge--OImp3R4AaABAg.945OhmMqbIQ94C0OZhHEiA		0	2020-01-25 02:57:46	Iris	@Gnome Sane First off, your problem with this us and them mentality is so off the curve it isn’t even funny anymore. The world is much more complex and nuanced than that. I am not Australian, so I am not the one to speak about what the government has or hasn’t done. I can only garner my opinions from what I read in the paper about their policies and from what I have read, it’s not good. I’m not understanding your point on carelessness and legal policy. There is legal policy, at least in the U.S., regarding careless behaviors on both Federal and State levels. Common Sense Laws are broken through and because of it many homes and areas have been destroyed. I don’t know the ins and outs about this man starting a fire to save his house, but it’s amateur hour that usually does the most damage. And it’s because of amateur hour types of actions that this man’s house was in the immediate danger that it was. He either knew what he was doing, or he was lucky. The point being that while firefighters use fires as control mechanisms, they are highly trained and know what they are doing. It can very easily get out of control and end up doing more harm than good if that amateur doesn’t know what he is doing. Given the changes and scope of the fires, this case could, however, change law, opinion and may be an option for the government to change policy. Perhaps programs can be set up in which people can learn how to use the fires. Maybe communities can be set up with trained and/or licensed people to use the practice without further burdening the firefighters with containing additional fires because of amateur maneuvers. These things need to be figured out before the fire season and not during. And because of your false dichotomy the rest of your argument falls apart. I don’t know what in your right mind led you to the conclusion that I trust government, but it didn’t come from any cogent reasoning, that’s for sure. Your tirade about preserved land doesn’t make sense unless one doesn’t care about quality of life. The reason that Roosevelt set land aside was because the land was being gobbled up for commercial use at such an alarming rate at the time, the fear was that unless it was done, there wouldn’t be any natural land for anyone to enjoy for one. Another reason was to protect the ecosystem that without, we couldn’t survive. Setting aside lands for wildlife and preservation is something that is vital. It also helps to protect smaller businesses from conglomerates from taking or destroying vital resources that other businesses thrive on. It’s a balance. So, while those looking at a land and seeing oil, minerals, and other resources, there is an equal set of others that see an industry for medicine, travel, fur, fisheries, and other ways to use the land. Why should the oil industry be the only one to tap resources at the expense of others? What’s diplomatic about that? You’re as rabid as those but lickers for the oil industries that wanted to drill oil rigs off the coast of Florida. Holiday travel is its main industry. I most certainly don’t want to vacation at a spot with an oil rig in front of my face. That’s idiotic. Balance. I’m sure that there are groups of people that cry that third world countries should be left alone so that they can attain the same economic fruits that the industrialized nations have. I’m not one of them. I think it’s naive to think that industry isn’t without its faults and it has made mistakes along the way. The success is in realizing what they are, fixing them and passing that knowledge down to those nations, so they do not make the same mistake. A great example of that is asbestos. See, and here is when the government comes in. Government has turned into a corporate socialist shill. They subsidize old technologies and refuse to support any new technologies that are competing with the old. They are systematically stifled for the interests of old ideas. Governments that do that don’t move or advance to the betterment of their country. They exacerbate in the destruction of it. Especially when other countries, that aren’t doing that, move ahead to the future. That is what we are seeing now. The lies and the agenda to keep the status quo is the Kool aid you're drinking and an abject failure. Your such an easy target. And I don’t know if you have taken your head out of the sand as of late. You find, that more people like me and especially younger sets, are not the yuppy consumerists of the past. You see it in the numbers and economic trends taking hold. More people are telecommuting, shopping locally, car sales are falling, and are very mindful of the products they buy. Clothing trends are for secondhand clothes and home sewn projects. However, I will agree with you, although it’s trending, there is still this mindset that it’s okay that Walmart destroys small businesses for the sake of a China made product manufactured under slave conditions. It’s a wonder why they are scratching their heads as to why their manufacturing jobs are going away. Immigrants? Please! It’s ironic that the ancestors of refugees are now complaining about refugees coming to their shores now. Where are they any different to the refugees of today aside from the time they are coming to the country. Isn’t that a bit hypocritical? Of course, it is. And as to scientists? If your diagnosed with cancer and have gone to all the cancer specialists in the world and 97% confirmed that you have cancer, odds are that the other 3% are off on their calculations. The science is in on climate and the vast majority is saying it is so. One just must follow the money to see why the minuscule few are saying it’s not true. It’s corporations and the fuel industry they drink from. The science is telling us that it’s us. The science is telling us we must act now or the environment that humans thrive on will become extremely hard for humans to survive and live in. But, nah, go ahead and keep your head in the sand. Pretend that every environmental scientist doesn’t know what they are talking about and believe your government and corporations that can’t possibly have any stake in keeping the status quo. Better yet, blame China for putting guns to corporations’ heads and moving manufacturing plants to their country for profit, no matter the consequences to its own citizens, and the industries in their own countries. You’re a prime example of what the dumbing down is all about	UCqYCLhLd7uwfOpiHgE6I31w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqYCLhLd7uwfOpiHgE6I31w	1	Ugzn8HTk5Ge--OImp3R4AaABAg	Rookie Sportsman

Yes, it's nice to think that we can all be good stewards, however, we know humanity does have those without the proper marbles to do so. It's carelessness as campgrounds or even missed oversights by companies that can be life-threatening. So, what are you implying? We don't try because of the minority few that are missing their marbles or do we tread on despite them? And the America I know didn't pay attention to what others were doing. They lead the way and had the rest of the world playing catch up. Yet, here you are sayng that since the rest of the world, we shouldn't? It's this attitude that threatens the American way. Green technology is the wave of the future. The rest of the world, especially China is delving into it and the rest of the world is leaving the U.S. in the dust as it clings to the relics of the past for its might. Fossil fuels still play a role, but the day will come that technology will replace them. Doesn't make those that are making it obsolete evil doers. It's the same arguments the horse and buggy sets made when we were transitioning with cars. It's time to move to the present century.

Ugzn8HTk5Ge--OImp3R4AaABAg.945OhmMqbIQ94B3TnbpTeE		0	2020-01-24 18:05:27	Iris	@john smith I guess it's a good sign that you actually know that we are keeping data. Sadly you don't pay attention to that data set. Luckily there are scientists that have. And what they say is unprecedented is that the temperature in that region has climbed up 1 degree. This is changing the normal weather patterns for the region, such as record-breaking temps, extended drought, stronger winds, rain pattern changes, etc. In fact, there have been significant shortfalls on the normal rain patterns since 2017. Yes, the region is known as a hot and dry region. However, as those 100-year-old records, you like to tout, show, even hot dry regions have a climate pattern that is considered the norm and those records show that those patterns are changing. So again, any idiot can see that if something is changing and the old way of dealing with the change isn't working, then one has to either see if they can do something to bring about the normal patterns again and/or begin adapting to the new reality. So, while grandpa may have been able to flick his cigarette to the ground without a thought when he was 20, you, on the other hand, have to make damn sure it 's out. Although Grandpa was a dumbass for doing it, the statistics weren't as high for him to start a fire as they are for his grandson today. The soil and brush although already dry for grandpa is even more so for grandson. That doesn't take an environmentalist, that takes common sense. And I'm done here. Anyone willing to swallow propagandist trope and accuse someone without evidence isn't someone anyone can have a reasonable debate with. You're obviously touting for the fossil fuel industry. You keep bringing it up, while I never once said that we should abolish fossil fuel use. Humans evolve, so does technology. If there is something better out there to replace fossil fuels, then yes, like the horse and buggy, we should transition over and if we're smart about it, we can do it without economic collapse.

Ugzn8HTk5Ge--OImp3R4AaABAg.945OhmMqbIQ948wWMhyzfg		0	2020-01-23 22:17:25	Iris	@john smith - I give up. I have had the mistaken premise that humanity at its core, does evolve and learn. No, it's not because more people are setting more fires. The fires are more extreme because the climate has changed. Australia has been in a drought that is unprecedented. One should be able to put two and two together. And, since the conditions or environment (whatever you want to call it) has changed, it not too far a stretch to think that maybe those 200-year-old tactics used in another environment may not hold true for this one. For example, One doesn't wear their snowsuit in January for the sake of it being January. They wear it because habitually it has been 20 degrees in the area. When the temperature rises to 60, you take it off and put on something that won't bring on a heat stroke within 5 minutes of putting it on. Nor do you keep wearing the same one when another is found to be much better. And mother nature isn't trying to kill us. She reacts to the stimulus we are giving her. It's nothing off her back but really sucks for everything else. It's frustrating, I thought it was bad when we were arguing about the hole in the ozone. It's worse now, it would have been left to devastate us at this rate. Instead, we finally got our act together and the Ozone has now healed. Hopefully, we can put our hubris on the shelf once again and just do what needs to be done not for earth, but for our own survival.

It doesn't take Einstein to recognize that the fires (no matter their origins) are becoming more extreme in scope and size. That is determined by the changing weather patterns, i.e. climate change. Unless one is a complete idiot if you notice or discover things that are a danger to you, one does what they can to remedy it. You wouldn't continue to live in a house you know has asbestos without either removing it or moving somewhere else. You wouldn't let a live wire dangle from the ceiling of your living room and just ignore it. This is no different. We need to find ways to either, fix, not exacerbate and/or adapt to those situations. Climate Change is no different. Go ahead and keep LYAO, the day will come that you will be affected as well.

However, through those billions of years, it has only been a sliver of that time that humans have been able to live on Earth. The environs have been perfect for us to thrive. So, what do you do? Ignore it? Or do you do what you can to save your species to either see if you could change it or see if you could adapt? it may not mean much too older folks who will be dead and gone before one really feels the full impact. However, there are younger generations that will and it is their right to move the world in the direction they want as the past generations have done for themselves. They live with the consequences.

Each engine can burn 640 gallons of diesel per hour. <br />At full power that equals 2,560 gallons per hour. At a typical cruising speed, using 40% power, that still means he is burning 1,024 gallons of diesel per hour. <br />In 24 hours of his vacation, he burns more fuel than I would in 42 years.

And I'm not going to sugar coat it and say that the Black community doesn't have problems with gun violence. However, if you look at the demographics of people that are ultimately the perpetrators of these mass shootings, it has never been a black or brown person. They are predominantly white and usually come from a suburban area with mental health issues.

I don't like the Trump policy of elimination. It sounds too much like wack-a-mole rather than a comprehensive review on what regulation is stifling vs. one that is a benefit. Large corporations have had too much power by buying officials that are supposed to work for us. A perfect example is the Tucker car. There is a film about it. Very good, but really gives an example of what large corporations are doing.	UCqYCLhLd7uwfOpiHgE6I31w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqYCLhLd7uwfOpiHgE6I31w	1	UgwgDWHy1trWMwqRTCR4AaABAg	Üf

Let's take gun ownership. Having grown up in a rural area, guns were an everyday part of my life. I was also surrounded by people with brains that knew how to handle them and teach the awesome responsibility of that privilege. That doesn't hold true for many other people and/or areas. While yes, there is a fringe minority that wants to take them away, the majority just want to put rules in place that ensures safety. I support a mandate that would have people prove they know the ins and outs of a firearm. I approve of background checks. I approve of closing the loop for gun show sales. This is the contributing factor to the cartels and the influx of refugees at the border. Something has shifted in the American psyche. Doesn't the fact that we are now selling bulletproof backpack not disturb you? Leaving things as they are isn't changing anything and proves non-regulation isn't being enforced, nor working.

I would say it's large corporations suppression of the non gas engines if we're being honest. I've heard the story IRL of all sorts of inventions and science projects that "just went missing".

Those technologies can't flourish if the government favors one industry over another. That's a form of regulation in itself. Common sense regulation is unfortunately, a necessity as corporations and individuals will knowingly put individuals in danger. The clean water act is just one of those regulations that proved that. That regulation also protected other industries that used the waterways as well. There is a balancing act that needs to happen. I agree that over-regulation is not good, but I also agree that non-regulation can be as hazardous as well.

I never looked back. I am on no medications and I am very fit for my age. I have not consumed a piece of animal flesh in over 20 years. The lie that we must consume animal protein is nothing more than propaganda sold to us in order build an industry! Same goes for dairy and the egg industry! Please watch the documentaries Dominion and Earthlings. It will tell the sad story of what we are doing to these poor sentient beings for no reason.
