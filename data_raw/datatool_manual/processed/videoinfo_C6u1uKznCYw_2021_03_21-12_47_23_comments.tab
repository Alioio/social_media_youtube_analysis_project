Opened the U.S. to illegal immigrants in a big way Signs executive order to allow transgender people to compete in women's races Shutting down the pipeline that would have made America energy independent and put most people out of work And then calling everyone who opposes you a Trump supporter or extreme right-wing, etc. I just want to say thank you for being blind and bringing the world closer to the resurgence of communism. And thanks to CROOKED MEDIA You support the reintroduction of the Middle East war and the genocide of Xinjiang, don't try to use your bloodied hands to stand on the so-called moral high ground and say how righteous or objective you are.

Personally, I believe in God, did you know the earth has always extremely slowly moved farther and farther away from the sun, hmmm, what would be the reason for that? What are the odds that an earth would be closer to the sun when there was no pollution and as pollution got worse the earth would continue to move the proper distance to sustain life so we didn&#39;t burn up or freeze to death? what are the odds? Now, people who don&#39;t believe in God do not consider these facts, they chalk it up to luck and they think they can fix it but does it need to be fixed if it works the way God intended it to work. Is man smarter than God or does man have a huge assss ego?	UCHKJj6GwXephAGmzd1Xv_3g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHKJj6GwXephAGmzd1Xv_3g	0

Especially since we have videos and pictures of his son smoking crack. Because that&#39;s where I think Joe Biden is cognitive decline comes from he was smoking crack with his son.

He said he would ban fracking so many times and then he lied and said he would not been fracking and then Trump interrogated him about it during the debate and he finally slipped up and said he would work it out. Joe by that doesn&#39;t want to talk about Trump&#39;s family because then he knows that they will bring up more things about his family. And either way if Joe Biden&#39;s kids are taking money from communist China or using foreign policy from the United States government profit for their own wealth.

How would he know this?<br /><br />He also stated that Trump said you vote won&#39;t count, however Trump never said that, he only said to vote in person. It is amazing how Biden gives out a website so people can record who they are going to vote for in advance. This way the Dems can track how much cheating is necessary.<br /><br />Thank deep my friends and you will come up with a realization this is a huge huge cheat!

Creating jobs will happen, but majority of those Jobs won’t be in the US, will be on other nations.<br />And 4. If he thinks going solar, wind and battery is the answer, then the word is fucked, because far more pollution and far more destruction of this planet will happen all thanks to the materials needed and materials being processed in order to create the materials for solar, battery and wind energy. Something that none of these politicians actually care to let the people know, and don’t forget these materials can last from 10 to 30 years.

It's not "admitting to fraud" if you mistakenly leave a word out of a sentence, especially for someone who has a stutter like Biden, so it's not fucking news any more than most of the rest of the nonsense used to fill up the 24 hour news cycle.

This is one of the cases where you are not even worth speaking too. Lying about being an engineer to make you look good??? Really is that the best you can? I have given great points, and you have in absolutely no way or fashion disproven them or given a good counter argument. You are simply not worth to speak too. I have explained many times that dementia isn’t all about stuttering it’s also about not knowing what you just said a second ago. Completely forgetting where you are and not understanding the conversation. This is something Joe Biden is suffering from that he did not ten years ago. Whatever it is it’s clear that he is suffering from age related issues and that’s not up for debate. He is nowhere near as quick as he was 10 years ago.

"Stuttering — also called stammering or childhood-onset fluency disorder — is a speech disorder that involves frequent and significant problems with normal fluency and flow of speech. People who stutter know what they want to say, but have difficulty saying it." "Stuttering may be worse when the person is excited, tired or under stress, or when feeling self-conscious, hurried or pressured. Situations such as speaking in front of a group or talking on the phone can be particularly difficult for people who stutter."

No Elon musk does not have Dementia. What you have completely misunderstood about dementia is that it’s an age related issue which makes you forget thing and make you speak really sluggish. You also often forget what you was about to say. Something that Biden does as a matter of fact very often. Joe Biden didn’t have this issue 10 years ago then he spoke perfectly with no giggles and weird hiccups, he also didn’t completely forget what he was about to say which Biden now does very often. He also didn’t stutter at all. It’s very rare to gain stutter just suddenly when has spoken perfectly all his life up until now, when he obviously became older. Thats why it’s very likely that all of his speech issues is as a result of some age related issue, which many doctors have pointed out is likely dementia. Whether it’s actually a disease (which in that case would likely be dementia) or not is up for discussion. Many doctors think so and some don’t but what is clear to any person is that age has taken its Toll on Joe Biden. His ability to hold speeches has significantly worsened in comparison to what it used to be because of his age.

He is suffering from all the symptoms of dementia, this is not far right propaganda even CNN and lots of leftist news channels have covered it. The argument you use about it being normal stuttering is also completely false. He never suffered from These speech issues before recently it’s clearly an age issue.

When I voted I saw many minority families voting the correct way. Myself included. The Democrats play is to align century-old-secure voting procedure with Republican values. It is not just the Republican Party way to vote securely but it&#39;s America&#39;s way to ensure election integrity. Instead of America protecting minorities in protecting itself, the Democrats have convinced you that they are the only ones who protect you. They are liars.

The planet did not ask you to save her. She is fine, and needs no saving especially from your poppycock. It is Humans who are in trouble, probably from being tricked by this guy and many like him for years that “promised the world” (planet). But when in power they implement more ways to aid in the destruction, of earth and humanity just to line their own pockets. Your talk of “saving the planet” is actually just your own egotistical viewpoint and you are only using the subject to try to gainer support by pulling on human emotions. Which you appear to not have. I sense no sympathy in your plea, I sense no real emotion in your scripted ramblings. I am concerned for the planet, and for the humans and all the creatures here and your misinformed panic and fear porn does not effect us. All humans want a clean, safe environment to live in, but you do not name one single thing you would implement to help anyone. There is not one solid idea that you thought of or championed that ever helped anyone but your own interests. You are a failure, and you have done nothing to help the planet or its occupants. Ever. (prove it) You speak a lot of poppycock and try to play “Science Says” with the people. Hoping we are dumb enough to play along and to believe “your science” VS “True Science” You and you government friends even toy with humans lives and livelihoods following “your science” during a very bad Common Cold(coronavirus) pandemic. AND somehow think you that YOU can save a planet? Some arrogance! You can’t even save yourself! The planet will be here long after humans have faded into a missing link. To be honest you only care about the habituated areas and how YOU and your buddies can make money off fixing the mess your own failed policies produced. The wildfires you speak of are not from climate change, it is obviously from not allowing proper forest management to occur. Giant fires have happened throughout history, documented for thousands of years, some much larger than the ones we have seen in our lifetimes. Today a fire might effect more people than in the past, which should be planned for, however to claim that climate change is creating bigger fires is False. (Fact Check: Research Wild Fires, Large Fires, Forest Fires, etc. Pre-1900) Flooding of large scale populated areas has more to do with people building in potential flood zones, not climate change. (Fact Check: Research Dried river basins and flood plains developed for habitation.) The climate changes on its own without any human intervention, (Fact Check: Research Seasons, History of Mini Ice Ages, Grand Canyon, Volcanoes, Solar Minimums / Maximums, etc.) There are many of us who see through your MALARKEY, so so many. You and your ilk love your “Science says” game; Science says- “Don’t wear a mask, you can get germs on it with your fingers”. Science says- “DO wear a mask, (unless you are a policy maker)”. Real science says to “Question Everything” but when we question ANYTHING then you gaslight us with terms like “Climate Denier, Conspiracy Theorist, AntiVaxer, and other even more derogatory titles. A lot of people have been harassed, discredited, fact checked, canceled; removed from Social media for simply linking an actual scientific study or news story that does not jive with what “SCIENCE SAYS” … your junk science. Even prominent Doctors, scientists, engineers, and Presidents have been blocked or completely removed from the discussion. Very similar to how the Poll Challengers were forced out of many ballot counting locations across USA recently, just for doing their job. The validation of Data, error checking. Save the planet!

Do you like that about him? Please do some research. He said something that I just could not believe. It was an over-the-top racial slur that I have never heard any public figure say except for him. It was a very specific word that only people who are familiar with Shakespeare's works know, and it is a truly horrific term. Just shocking. Do some research and wake up. I am terrified right now.

When Joe says "We put together,.. I think, the most extensive and inclusive voter fraud organization in the history of American politics." I am expected to NOT believe his own words, but to believe others that claim he meant "The most extensive and inclusive voter fraud ( PREVENTION ) organization in the history of American politics". Even though Joe never corrects himself or tells us how to learn more about this mysterious organization, I am expected to believe what others claim he meant, instead of what he actually said. Okay, lets just say I believe YOU and others and I do not believe the words coming right out of Joe's own mouth. Please answer me this! Where is this "extensive and inclusive voter fraud ( PREVENTION ) organization"? What is the name of it? Why are they not working to find ANY fraud, Republican or Democrat? If they are so "extensive and inclusive," why can’t anyone point me in the direction of potential fraud they stopped, or investigated? Why are there ZERO news reports of this organizations findings? What is this organization called? Website? How do we see what, if anything, they have learned? There must of been some fraud happening…MATE	UCQljJKJWHTLE1NEy9fjHH6Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQljJKJWHTLE1NEy9fjHH6Q	1	UgwrAsZUs94xNMLMxW14AaABAg	rio quibu

Biden choose as decent human being to not go after Trump’s children, that was funny. Trump children worked hard in the real world, where there is rules and laws and if break the laws you go to jail. Biden’s children made money in the political world, where there is corruption, bribes, lobbyists and you get paid for nothing but your name and future favours. In the political world there is no consequences no matter how much money the useless Biden family takes in from shady sources. If Biden would have opened that can of worms, it would have exploded in his face. There is lot more skeletons in the Biden family closet (a lot more skeletons ), than there is the Trump family closet.

If all of you who stop at the end of the sentence about the voter fraud organization has bothered to watch the rest I&#39;d be amazed. You&#39;re all hunting for something to hold against him and willing to take whatever you can out of context to do so. It&#39;s pathetic. Just ignore the few seconds after that where it is clear he is talking about fighting voter fraud and run with it. And why is that?? Because you&#39;re desperate and can&#39;t find any actual valid negative facts. Just like your hero in office right now, making up whatever he can, with not one iota of evidence, because he refuses to accept facts. And when all else fails and you can&#39;t take the words Biden says out of context what do you&#39;ll always resort to? Making fun of the stutter he&#39;s had to work to get past, and taking that out of context and claiming it&#39;s a sign of mental decline. Again, pathetic. You&#39;ll are all fine with Trump never actually answering anything and repeating lies and conspiracies, and ready to believe every last far-fetched outrageous piece of bs he spouts. It&#39;s unbelievable how far we as AMERICANS have NOT actually come.	UCdYA1L7aCvdxeOMgnhObNqw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdYA1L7aCvdxeOMgnhObNqw	0

The same extremists who were looting, burning and perpetrating violence against police were the same people counting and collecting votes. Hardcore violent extremists for weeks and months, then perfect angels on election night. There is a Zero percent chance these extremists goons with criminal records are going to be fair on election night. They have no interest in a fair election. They have to put high tech security cameras all over like Vegas, so every thing is watched during the vote count, from vote dating, signatures, opening of the ballads, counting by hand and by computer and then cross referenced to make sure they add up. Security cameras, so when there is major anomalies like this year, they can quickly check security footage and make sure someone is not padding votes or destroying votes. This election was awful, they have to increase high tech security, police and military out in full force collecting votes, instead of regular good people, who have been infiltrated by extremists. If you are a violent rioter, you be charged and never be allowed near anything to do with elections.

UgzftDyqlyqSEaZB7M54AaABAg	0	0	2020-11-22 18:40:02	Seth Tedder	Do you not understand context? (<a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/biden-admit-voter-fraud/)">https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/biden-admit-voter-fraud/)</a>. They have put together an organization to combat voter fraud. He describes it if you keep listening. <a href="http://iwillvote.com/">Iwillvote.com</a> to make a plan to vote and the number to call with over 1,000 lawyers on the line. This is in response to limiting the number of early voting sites to sometimes one per county (Kentucky), removing mail dropboxes so people can&#39;t vote by mail (Texas) rather than catch covid and potentially die by going to overcrowded polling places (again, overcrowded because the GOP tries to have as few early voting sights as possible), trying to stop legally cast ballots from being counted (as Trump literally filed a lawsuit to try and do in Pennsylvania, alleging that they did not have access to the process. Not true, it was proven in court and even admitted by Trump&#39;s lawyers that those representing the Trump campaign were present as poll watchers). Then there was the Proudboys &quot;stand back and stand by comment,&#39;&#39; the incidents of armed Trump supporters planning to show up at certain polling locations, the Trump encouragements for his supporters to show up and watch on voting day, which some interpreted as potential voting intimidation. Also, Trump has complained about the nonexistent vote by mail fraud for a long time, when his own commission under Mike Pence found I believe 3 cases NATIONWIDE. Can&#39;t you see he was setting up his excuse when he lost? That&#39;s exactly what he&#39;s doing now. I was told for 4 years that Donald Trump was the duly elected President of the United States, and I accepted that and even supported him for the first 1-2 years. It was when I rejected his division and bad policy that I was called a &quot;sore loser,&quot; even though I was ecstatic that he won at first. People went so far as to say that I couldn&#39;t even disagree with him, and if I did I was somehow rejecting the fact that he was elected. I&#39;m not going that far now, you&#39;re entitled to your 1st Amendment rights, you can agree and disagree with whoever you want. The only thing that should be followed here is the same standard that it was insisted I follow, and that I did from the beginning, Joe Biden is now the duly elected President-elect of the United States of America, just as Donald Trump was the duly elected President-elect of the United States in 2016. Agree or disagree with either one or both, it has no bearing on who was elected President. Facts do not care about your feelings.

Also people who are irresponsible with their words such as the president was you know, they had no choice because the ppl following him are ready to be violent just because he wants that or incites them to be that way. If you are speaking normally not using dangerous or threatening language you should never be censored imo. It is what it is though, people have to be held accountable for the things they say and do. Obviously I don't like censorship but for some people it is a must because they are unhinged and should not be allowed to just spew hatred, division, lies and violent/dangerous language against others who oppose them without any consequences. This cannot happen in 2021, maybe in 1945 but not in 2021 my friend, the world is different now every person no matter who you are has a voice. Censorship isn't good with that I will agree with you however, for some people they are just asking for it and not taking any responsibility for the things they say and how much damage those words cause. It has to start somewhere for these people to learn this is not how you should treat and speak about others who differ from you, many STILL in 2021 have not learned this concept as you can see and have chosen not to accept reality. The world isn't just White anymore you know. Okay buddy, good luck to you be safe but one word of advice to you man. Trump was not answer to all the problems going on in America its good that he is on his way out. For all we know Biden may not be either, however he does deserve the chance to show how he can lead and direct the country from the mess its in now. He wants peace, tranquility, acceptance, unity and calmness in America you should want the same things as he does if you want a better country for the world to use as an example. If you feel that strongly that Biden and the democrats are going in the wrong direction then I would suggest becoming an independent my friend because The Republican party who basically were puppets for Trump the last 4 years are FOR SURE not the answer to the problems the country faces, they just lie to you and tell you what you want to hear while pushing their own agendas. if you don't think the democrats are the answer for the future then I would suggest being someone who supports neither just my advice to you okay buddy good luck out there be well and all the best. Remember at the end of the day no matter what side of the isle you fall ALL people matter and EVERY vote is important. To the future of the country, whether for Trump or for Biden. Everyone matters not just one or the other.	UCqKXnBKnVKHqKAjVGpInA7Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqKXnBKnVKHqKAjVGpInA7Q	1	UgzG46hKA2607jK766N4AaABAg	Anthony Fernandez

This is from the great Abraham Lincoln- “If we falter and lose our freedoms, it will be because we destroyed ourselves”. They are censoring people in our country and trying to cancel others right now as I write this response to you.This should be of great concern and disturbing to all of us. My family left such a country for this one because of the freedoms it offers. I'm one of many Democrats who is unwilling to follow the new direction of the party. I choose to leave it behind. Good luck to you, my friend.	UC6MUPUPp6qGhpfwLBq7O9GA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6MUPUPp6qGhpfwLBq7O9GA	1	UgzG46hKA2607jK766N4AaABAg	Anthony Fernandez
UgzG46hKA2607jK766N4AaABAg.9GLPTJtd05f9IGfreb3lyA		0	2021-01-08 21:45:21	Matthew R	​@Anthony Fernandez ya i disagree with you buddy but that's fine. NO EVIDENCE again was proven in the courts of law as i figured would happen, all it was was made up lies, conspiracy theories from the extreme right and misinformation from Trump all mixed together that caused all this confusion Biden won FAIR AND SQUARE a month ago already as I have said all along. The courts dismissed baseless claims cuz they weren't based on anything lol as I mentioned even the SUPREME COURT didn't hear it that should tell you something. Courts dismiss false evidence that can't be proven FACTUAL that's what happened man. Also if half the country is mad about it then that's how it is now they know how the left felt when they didn't want Trump and felt that Russia helped him win it goes both ways right. Biden deserves the chance to fix Trump's wrongs that's for sure. He left the country in a disaster with much more hatred and division and a virus mess lets be honest about that. Fraud has to be proven factual in the courts to mean anything remember that, and this "alleged fraud wasn't". So cuz half the ppl thought it was fraud the other half who thought it was legit don't matter. Their voices count too right especially if they feel they won or their candidate won fair and square you know. They evidence were FALSE CLAIMS that's why they weren't allowed to be heard in courts my friend that's how these things work. They gotta be based on REAL FACTS not allegations. The court REJECTS FALSE CLAIMS dude that's not hard to understand. So because some ppl seen some random evidence of something it makes it true?? That don't mean anything dude the courts if you can prove its not false allegations that's where it becomes true and something different. Makes no sense no mail in ballot lol. Some people prefer to vote that way so I don't agree with that especially now with the virus it was the preferred/safest way to vote for Biden people who didn't wanna be in the crowds, so I do not agree and many other wouldn't agree to that either. Can't compare wal mart to voting lol. Its an essential service right ppl have a right to buy groceries and other essentials to survive do they not lol??? So that makes no sense that comparison. Investigations may continue but again won't find anything cuz its all based on false claims starting from Trump and his people as I have been saying and has been proven true all along. You and many others can see a full investigation of the machines and ballots but I do not think its fair to subject people who voted for Biden and feel they won fair and square to that. Or do you just care about "your" people. People who voted for Biden are Americans too you know and their vote counts no matter how your people feel. They block the requests because there is no need the election was fair and free and Biden won they won't allow requests based on false allegations not proven in court of fraud you get me?? machines and ballots do belong to the people and the people have spoken that Biden has won and will be the next president. All this wasn't done last election by dems or ppl on the left for Trump so why should it be now?? They aren't hiding nothing NO FRAUD WAS EVER PROVEN COURT, but why subject Biden people who FEEL the have won to a recount or checking ballots and other things? just to please Trump and his ppl?? What makes them special and above Biden people for this?? Yes Happy 2021 to you and be safe, hope you can deal with it when Trump is gone soon times here. Biden will be the next president and Kamala very soon can't wait for the inauguration I'm counting down the days to that and new leadership as are many others who feel the same way I do about a new direction and real leadership for the country. Good day bro.	UCqKXnBKnVKHqKAjVGpInA7Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqKXnBKnVKHqKAjVGpInA7Q	1	UgzG46hKA2607jK766N4AaABAg	Anthony Fernandez

The courts never allowed it to get to the point where the evidence could be presented. This country needs voter reform. We can't continue running our elections where they are open to fraud. Now half the country doesn't believe this was a fair and honest election because they have seen the evidence that the courts would not allow. We need voter ID for sure and no mail-in ballots for people healthy and able to make it to the voting booth. It's really odd how people can make it to Walmart during a pandemic but are unable to vote in person. I hope the investigations continue. I as many would love to see a full forensics of the machines and ballots. They need to stop blocking the requests. The machines and ballots belong to the people. This would put to bed the concerns of many such as myself if all is good. What are they hiding? Happy 2021 to you and stay safe.

You win some you lose some it is what it is. Anyways Happy 2021 man the world needs peace and healing lets hope we get it this year for everyone's sake.

Trump will no longer be president in a month's time and I can't wait for that. IT WAS A FAIR AND FREE ELECTION THAT BIDEN WON IN A LANDSLIDE. You and the rest of Trump land are just in denial and being delusional sore loser babies about it. You can go back to your holes after Biden is sworn in as president, good riddance!!!! I'am hungry actually for justice and DEMOCRACY to prevail. Biden and the PEOPLE will not let the will of 80 million voters plus to be stolen away because of Trump and his delusions. We don't care about him cuz he is a bully and pathetic as are all of his sad sac supporters. As I thought you can't LINK ONE SINGLE case where a judge is declaring your "CLAIMS" lol to be true or factual and that Trump is winning cases to over turn the election. You know why?? Cuz all you people spout are LIES, CONSPIRACY THEORIES, and BASELESS FRAUD CLAIMS with "evidence" you can't BACK UP in the courts of LAW. You can't just cry foul because you or Trump say there was. You have to prove it in COURT for it to mean anything you numbskull just educating you cuz u seem to not know hot this works. You are a loser and even more pathetic than Trump give me a break. Btw the only criminal, crook, con man, thief here is Trump and all of the people he is pardoning and Rudy. That right there shows you how truly corrupt and crooked Trump is.

PROVE IT IN COURT WITH LINKING COURT WINS the Trump team is winning to overturn the election in his favor, that's how it works dummy..I will wait for that I bet you can't LINK ANY WIN cuz what you claim as evidence are lies, conspiracy theories and is FALSE/BASELESS. About the vaccine you should take your own advice we don't need more brainless mindless idiots out there who are so easily influenced by one unstable creep, con man, pervy orange dictator wannabe who wears a diaper not to mention whos is in denial over HIS MASSIVE loss to Biden. You ppl are delusional. Like I said if your evidence is so strong how come Trump hasn't even won ONE CASE IN OVER A MONTH OF FRAUD IN A COURT OF LAW where a judge declared it to be true??? Huh??? Trump has lost over 50 cases in court and also in the Supreme Court(Highest Court in the Land) how much more PROOF do you idiots need to know that HE LOST FAIR AND SQUARE to Mr. Biden the 46th president of the USA to be.

As Biden will be the 46th president of the USA along with Kamala Harris for VP very soon. Good day to you. #PROVETHESTEAL in a court of law and #STOPTHESTUPID are big deals.

He also said don't be discouraged to vote by mail which Trump said you shouldn't so he could get more votes in person which is the whole reason he lost, Biden really encouraged the mail in vote and Trump said the opposite and he wonders why he lost lol!!. Its funny how easy ppl can be fooled by not taking into account the whole context of what he is saying. People like to cut bits and pieces out here and there to make it look like he said something else, nice try but once again FAIL. Trump lost and that's it. Biden's main message here is not to be intimidated to VOTE that is the whole point of this lol. He also encouraged ppl who could not get to polls in person to vote by mail. HIS MAIN MSG TO HIS BASE.....VOTE EARLY, which is exactly what they did. Our democracy is at stake, all true words he spoke which Trump and his ppl like to ignore, they take a part of what he said lol and cut out the rest. Do your research there is even a hotline for this organization and a WEBSITE!!! Please do your due diligence and stop blindly believing everything Trump and his team of liars tells you.

Can it be proven in a court of law has it been proven to be real yet enough to win a court case??? Affidavit from who, who are these people?? Are they credible has any of what they are saying been proven as factual in a court of law??? if so link it or else just save it cuz then u are spewing more lies and baseless conspiracy theories/misinformation like your buddy Trump has been doing this whole time. What stats do they have?? From who?? showing what?? source?? credible?? proven in a court of law??? disproven??? who are the people coming up with these stats?? where did they get them from??? Many questions and very little answers that's why they can't prove it their evidence isn't good enough or STRONG enough to hold up in the courts cuz its not REAL lol, just things people are coming up with or trying to make look like something its not trying to help Trump anyway they can to win when he didn't, this is just what it comes down to man sorry to break it to you. Witnesses don't mean anything. ANYONE CAN SAY THEY SAW OR DID ANYTHING, what does that prove?? Who are they that a judge should take their word for it??Have these witnesses won any court cases that will be enough to reverse the election?? If so please share the link don't just talk about it, BACK IT UP with info/facts of THEM winning court cases in the COURT OF LAW not just talking shit about this or that without concrete evidence. Minor wins in cases don't mean anything if they are trying to get Trump in office that is basically stuff that happens every election. NO WIDESPREAD VOTER FRAUD as is the Trump team claim has been proven in the courts. News reports from where?? What source is it?? Is it a neutral source, link it so I can see what you are talking about to see if the source is credible or not don't just talk about it. Is the source non biased towards Trump as in NOT THE RIGHT WING MEDIA or Fox news?? Yes the list does go on and on OF BASELESS LIES, MISINFORMATION, and CONSPIRACY THEORIES from the right and the Trump team that CANNOT be proven in a court of law because the courts don't like false claims. NO CONCRETE EVIDENCE THAT CAN HOLD UP IN COURT just people saying they saw something or did something for someone WITHOUT LEGIT PROOF that holds up in court, they can't lie under oath remember that. If these people have won any court cases again please link it cuz I want to see it, to my knowledge they have NOT won anything and its going to stay that way TRUMP IS DONE. Biden is the new president come 2021 and Kamala Harris the new VP. THE COURTS HAVE DISPROVEN ALL THESE FALSE CLAIMS and are tossing them out by the day its laughable.

Get that through your head. Trump can do whatever he wants IT WON"T WORK LOL!! IT DOES NOT MATTER WHAT HE DOES BECAUSE HE IS A LOSER and always has been. I'm telling you Biden is president ELECT and has been for almost a month now! In case you were not aware. BIDEN team don't have time to dick around and play footsie with Trump and his team of delusional morons who keep enabling his behavior. They have to start getting their info and briefings to LEAD AND DIRECT the country unlike the Trump team was able to do. They gotta start with fixing the virus pandemic problem Trump left for them with his inability to lead a country because he was unfit to be in office. YOU ARE NOT INFORMED because all you do is watch and listen to what the Trump team, Rudy, and right wing media says which are all blatantly biased towards Trump you can't even take them seriously. Trump still has not won shit in any courts in terms of his lawsuits that is the reality and that STILL TO THIS DAY has not changed. When it does come back and talk to me, until then its just a WITCH HUNT with no proof of anything and no concrete evidence of nothing that they can prove in a court of law. The courts don't take conspiracy theories, baseless/false claims, and lies lightly so that's why NOTHING is going to work for the Trump team. You can say whatever the fuck you want as well still not gonna change the fact BIDEN IS PRESIDENT ELECT RIGHT NOW as we speak!!! and will be the next president come January 2021 along with Kamala Harris as VP. When and if Trump even gets to the supreme court I will come back and LAUGH at you if he do not succeed so you better hope he does I will be watching, but he ain't gonna reverse shit I'm confident in that. 80 million plus Americans have spoken and once again THEY WANT BIDEN, they are tired of the Trump shit show at the White House. It does not matter what delusional in denial Trump wants and his sore loser cry baby base. #DiaperDon's days are numbered, this is a sure thing.

Trump and his ppl are LOSING every case of fraud in courts of law and they have not reversed anything in terms of TRUMP winning the election give it up man lol he isn't going to win. They can still investigate but it won't go any good Biden won FAIR AND SQUARE lol he got more votes and that has not changed or been reversed sorry dude it is what it is lol. Time to move on. What Trump is doing is a big WITCH HUNT right now. Trump is either too delusional, stupid or in denial to accept he lost and that Biden won the election in a landslide. ohhhhhh Sidney Powelll oh jeeez what will Biden do now lmao!!! You really believe Trump will win eh haha that's sad but hey you can believe what you want. Biden and Kamala Harris will be in the White House come January 2021 and if you don't believe me just wait and see that for yourself. Yes the truth will come out and when they announce that Trump is the real criminal I will come back to you to see what you have to say alright deal?? lol. Also nothing has changed Biden is still PRESIDENT ELECT and he won the popular vote 80 million plus votes that isn't going to be overturned and the electoral college. TRUMP GOT SMACKED lol when he was so confident and cocky about it that he would win, serves him right for being a bully. He just can't handle the loss and his supporters are crying the blues now like babies. That's the reality and the TRUTH and the fact of the matter is Trump is going to facing many lawsuits once he leaves office starting with Tax Fraud/Evasion and he STILL to this day has not shown his taxes. What is he hiding?? We will see about that the truth will come out and I'm looking forward to seeing what ppl find on what Trump has been up to behind the scenes while in office and before that too.

He's made fun of Indians, called out the blackness of those who don't vote for him, called a guy fat on his campaign trail, lied about his son laundering money for him. Tony Bobulinski showed him for the fraud he is. He's compromised day 1! He isn't fit to be president of a nursing home let alone our country.

You are one of those ppl who thought RALLY size determines how much support a candidate has lol. So ppl can't support Biden from a far lol?? You ppl act like there is no PANDEMIC VIRUS going on and the USA don't lead the world in it. BIDEN PPL SUPPORTED and support him now from a far cuz they actually care about the health and well being of others unlike Trump morons. Trump is a thief/crook and can't wait to see him outta there with all the lawsuits he has coming for him, especially regarding his taxes. Also not sure if you knew Trump wears a diaper and shits himself constantly, did you ever hear of #DiaperDon its a real thing go check it out. Yes Biden got the most votes in history for an incoming president, shows you how much ppl didn't want your buddy Trump, time to take his act on the road, ppl are tired of seeing his clown show in the White House, that's mainly why Biden got all those votes and Obama endorsed him and went on the campaign for him. People wanted to make sure they came out this time to vote cuz many didn't last time and look what happened Trump got elected, so this time they came out to vote for the other guy to make sure that didn't happen this time around again. Yup Obama campaigned for BIDEN hello lol its obvious ppl who voted for Obama and wanted Obama las time would vote for Biden now, except this time they told everyone to MAKE SURE TO GET OUT AND VOTE which they did and in huge numbers VOTE VOTE VOTE and vote early that was their message from the Biden campaign, its like Trump ppl were on another planet they did not see this is what Biden's team was preaching the whole time. Now Trump and his ppl wanna cry about it cuz all they did was attend super spreader rallies in a world wide pandemic and came out in person to vote and expected that was going to be enough to win lol ya FAIL!!! BIDEN HAS THE MOST VOTES IN HISTORY FOR A PRESIDENT ELECT, that speaks volumes to just how much support he had from a far. Those ppl who filled the venues to hear Trump speak spread the coronavirus bravo good for them lol. Also they must have wasted their time cuz Trump didn't really say anything worth listening to at those rallies. RALLY SIZE DOES NOT DETERMINE SUPPORT LOL!!!keep that in mind. Biden ppl actually STAYED AWAY from huge rallies and crowds because of the VIRUS out there which Trump ppl never gave a shit about including Trump himself. THIS DOES NOT MEAN Biden did not have a huge following. Which you saw the Biden ppl come out once they announced he won. They celebrated his victory on the streets and you saw some of his support there for A VICTORY CELEBRATION, which they were entitled to whenever a candidate wins a presidential election, or is projected to win. Before that they took precautions which EVERYONE should be doing considering the US lead the world in coronavirus cases and deaths. Its almost as if Trump ppl are just finding this out now for the first time. HELLO!!!!! lol wake up.

Just baseless lies and claims and theories from all the ppl in denial Trump lost."* Right, this is the most popular president of all time in US politics. True, he couldn't get 50 people to show up to a campaign event, his Thanksgiving speech literally had a 1000 people listening to it, he's senile, but he got the largest vote turn out in teh history of the country, more than Obama did, he got a higher percentage of the black vote than even Obama did. Trump got the largest number of votes for an incumbent in history - he filled up venues of up to 100,000 people just to hear him speak. We had a coup.

You really think they are going to change AN ENTIRE election lol. At most they might be able to toss out some votes but to change an entire election where Biden won by 6 million more overall votes come on even you can't be that stupid to actually believe they will reverse that for Trump lol?? Even if 100 witnesses say they saw something, what does that prove lol?? They are still just saying they saw something without actual concrete evidence to back it up. What makes these ppl credible, that a JUDGE should take their word for it and what they produce?? Who are they lol?? Anyone can say anything if their proof was so strong they would be winning cases. However, they are all still being thrown out of legal courts which they should be on the count of the claims are baseless not actually consisting of anything worth looking into of substance or reversing, just a bunch of sore losers reaching because Trump is about to be out. I am okay with Biden winning cuz he got 80 million votes 6 million more or so than Trump, Biden got the majority it was not even close actually. Biden won LEGALLY in the electoral college as well and Trump just can't handle that HE LOST!!. I'm okay with Biden winning as everyone who voted for Trump was in 2016 when it appeared Russia helped him win, Trump ppl didn't care that time about others looking into that they just accepted he was winner so what's the difference now?? Cuz now its not going for your guy lol?? Ya take all the time that you need but Biden actually needs to get in there sooner rather than later to start making his transition as HE IS PRESIDENT ELECT ALREADY regardless of what you ppl and Trump think, the Biden team don't have time to dick around and cater to Trump and his ppl who are still in denial and being babies about losing. Important issues need to be attended to and Trump won't do shit about them he just golfs all day he was never fit to be president, its a serious job with real issues he never took seriously. So Biden has to get in there as a president to be SHOULD BE ALLOWED to in terms of getting information for his team to start fixing the Trump mess he has left for him. Starting with Trump's biggest failure the CORONAVIRUS which Trump and his ppl/base care nothing about but is a very serious issue with lives at stake to the rest of us. So if that's okay with you Biden and his team need that info and those briefings from the Trump team to start fixing the colossal fuck up Trump has left the country in which includes having the most virus cases and deaths in the world btw if you were not aware. Its okay Trump can continue having his super spreader rallies spreading his germs/lies but just far away from the WHITE HOUSE and away from ppl who actually care about other Americans and their health and well being. Trump can have his rallies with all the selfish misinformed, entitled ppl, who feel the election was Trump's god given right to win and to have. Not how a democracy works sorry, any candidate who runs has an opportunity to win as Trump is finding out now no matter what he thinks of Joe Biden and the election/voting process.

This is the organization down below here, pretty much to MAKE SURE YOUR VOTE counted for democratic voters, this is what Biden was talking about. What he's taliking about is right here: https://democrats.org/where-we-stand/the-issues/vote/ You can even call their number 1-833-DEM-VOTE (1-833-336-8683) Like I said, CONTEXT matters, in school they teach you this....don't ignore or overlook these details just because you wanted Trump and he didn't win. Sorry man better luck next time. Trump is going to need luck actually when this is done with all the legal trouble coming his way. Biggest baby and sore loser I have ever seen this Trump guy. Very UN-PRESIDENTIAL the way he is acting now and has acted 4 years now making a mockery of the White House spreading his germs everywhere there.

HE SAID THEY HAVE AN ORGANIZATION TO DEFEND AGAINST VOTER FRAUD. There is even a hotline where democratic voters could have called to make sure their vote got counted that is what he was talking about. Meanwhile Trump has done plenty of things to try and create fraud in his favor/STEAL it from Biden and is still doing shady shit now with all of his actions trying to block and reverse shit, along with his team of morons. THAT RIGHT THERE my friend is attempting to FRAUD and steal an election of course none of you ppl even mention anything about that, cuz you turn a blind eye to it. Trump and his family are nothing but crooks and can't wait till him and the rest of the clowns he has under him are gone. 4 years of a disaster and a circus at the WHITE HOUSE thanks to Trump the country is in a MESS! Virus cases going up and deaths counting by the DAY!! thanks to this moron. Trump is the worst president I have ever seen and could actually be a criminal. Many lawsuits are pending against him and ppl will come after him for Tax Fraud. HE STILL HAS NOT SHOWN HIS TAXES BTW, what is he hiding??. After all this is done can't wait to see what unfolds, that's why he don't wanna leave he knows he is gonna be in big shit once he leaves office because now he won't have the presidency to hide behind and cover his crimes. Oh and BTW yes Biden has been in politics for 47 years BUT!! this is his first time as PRESIDENT buddy so that's all that really counts and many ppl are excited to see what he can do as president in terms of fixing the country from Trumps colossal fuck up and how he left everything after 4 years of his bullshit. Biden and Kamala will bring normalcy, calm, integrity, diversity, truth, leadership and much needed direction to the white house and country unlike what Trump was able to provide putting ppl against each other dividing, stirring hate with his language and pretty much doing whatever he wants no more of that and finally he can take his twitter fingers somewhere the fuck else, that dude was really fucking annoying by the end of it. Finally done lol, 4 years too late imo.	UCqKXnBKnVKHqKAjVGpInA7Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqKXnBKnVKHqKAjVGpInA7Q	1	UgzG46hKA2607jK766N4AaABAg	Anthony Fernandez

Anybody can say they saw anything, is that supposed to hold up in a court of law to change an entire election lol, where millions voted?? Fact remains they CAN'T prove anything that's why all their lawsuits are being thrown out of courts everywhere. It don't matter what WITNESSES say they saw without evidence cuz its called HEAR SAY maybe you heard of that term??? Either way it still don't change the fact this is a BIG waste of time by the Trump team to delay Biden from making his transition which he is entitled to do as president elect btw and Trump is obstructing that process like a little sore loser baby, that should be illegal of him to do actually. Trump lawsuits are being laughed out of courts and tossed out by the day as States and counties begin certifying Joe Biden wins in those places. Its a joke what Trump is doing nothing more needs to be said about that. Can't wait till he is gone he is a disgrace of a president if you can even call him that.

It is bound to happen due the living earth giving birth pains. The Holy Scriptures tells that the 1st world who had never seen rain was destroyed by rain. I am certain they were concerned about a type of climate change as they saw the clouds grow darker. No advance technology nor change in lifestyle could have prevented GOD&#39;S judgement. Just like today. GOD warned that this world would be destroyed by fire. What you perceive as climate change is a setup for the fulfillment of GOD&#39;S end time plan. Have you ever considered that it could be an angle(s) setting California abaze. It has the highest concentration demonic activity and child sacrifice than any other state. But take note, many other cities are soon to be set ablaze. Bottom line, if you choose to ignore the Holy Bible. Then you have failed to prepare for your eternity. CHRIST THE HOPE OF ETERNAL LIFE came not only to die in your stead. But He came to introduce to us the world of the Spirit and the Kingdom of His Father. You are not just flesh and blood but you are an eternal spirit. You are here to choose whom you will serve. DO NOT just take my word for it. It is all written in scriptures.

Of course he's implying Trump's planned ng a coup against him but, that's what they always do...blame their opponents for what "they" are actually up to, during the process & even before. That way when we say "Coup"...their Sheeples will say, "oh no! It wasn't us! We heard about this months ago & it the Republicans forming a coup against us!"

This assumption that it is harder for black people to vote because the democrats think black people are too stupid to find the DMV or aquire an ID. The democratic party expects the black community to vote for them because "Republicans want the black community dead" and the only savior for them is the White Democrat in their eyes. They will fear monger and promise prosperity, while allowing more black babies to be aborted than born and locking up their voting base once they are done with them. Hillary called the black community youth as "super predators that need to be brought to heel." Does that sound like a compassionate person or a racist?

Not everyone gets to take the day off and stand in hours long queue and register for a voter id. One is supposed to provide documents which many people simply do not possess. Tragically this happens to disenfranchised people of India similar to black people in the US. So people who really should matter do not matter at all. Making it easier to vote is a necessity and also making the population informed enough so they don’t vote against their own interests. And also is it not common knowledge, the waiting times in black majority areas are atrocious there? Similar to your public school approach? Fix the system instead of showcasing ignorance.

It's well known phenomena seen everywhere . Not just in the US. Now if you make voting harder with the poll tax, one mail in ballot in the whole county, Voter Id requirement. Across the country, about 11 percent of Americans do not have government-issued photo identification cards, such as a driver’s license or a passport. If I am poor, I ain't taking a day off to get a damn Id just to vote and pay some extra for the Id as well. Voting ain't compulsory and there's no fine so I might not vote.

The economy has basically continued to grow at the same rate it did for 8 years under Obama, so my life isn't especially better or worse under trump. America's standing in the world is worse. Our allies don't trust us. Our enemies are thrilled to see how quickly we're falling apart as a country. Trump hasn't done any of the things he said he would do. What's in that enormous prop binder that's supposedly his health plan for a second term? The one he's been promising would be so much better than the AHA, and dragging his feet about passing for 4 years, while having almost complete control of congress? He's a clown, and pretty soon you'll all see how dangerous he is. Where would you draw the line? What would he have to do to lose your unquestioning allegiance? Write it down, if you can even think of one thing because I guarantee he'll do it.

If Biden gets in due to cheating, get ready to have your freedoms taken away. It won’t happen overnight, but it will. You’ll be begging for Trump back.

He really did just want to get the fuck out and these idiots keep dragging in his problems to his dad's political life, who is probably the best dad ever considering how patient he is and how nonjudgmental he has been all these years while Hunter wasted his life However, while Hunter's allegations have a lot of truth, there's a lot of twisted words and statements.

FAR LEFT DEMOCRATS WANT (Open borders) so everybody can flood in the USA &amp;, (Free Health Care) for Everybody NEW and OLD &amp; (Free College) &amp; (Higher taxes) plus (Defund Police) and so much more which to anyone that can see this is a bad idea and if not then ppl have no common sense, This is just suicide for America! THE USA IS ALREADY IN DEBT BY MULTI- BILLIONS, if not Trillions Of DOLLARS!! SO How Can The USA Provide all of these people living in America with FREE HEALTH CARE and on top of that having Millions of ppl coming in with our Open Borders! so many of millions of people would also want these free Government Assistance &amp; Would Come To AMERICA Which Would Cause Our Economy To Be ruined far beyond repair and the Government System to Collapse because of the Amount of DEBT it was under, The US system &amp; The US Economy Would not be able to handle it and America would Collapse in on itself and this is the GOAL that is being pushed by crazy far-left Democrats h They are trying to DESTROY AMERICA!! For real Everybody open your EYES This is Plain as day To see it very Easily once you put the facts together and block out the propaganda &amp; fake news, This method that is being used on us is exactly the method that is used by the CCP, AKA Chinese Communist Party!

We can spend trillions of (our) dollars on renewable energy and, in 100 years, global warming will have continued unabated. Check out the MIT Climate Symposium&#39;s conclusions on our ability to significantly affect climate change. On that issue there is NOT a consensus among climate scientists!

Switching over to renewable energy and moving away from fossil fuels doesn't hurt anyone. Yes people will talk about the jobs lost but those people can be retrained in new fields that renewable energy brings about. So why not do what we can to prevent climate change even if it MAY continue anyways? Doesn't hurt to try and it MAY end the human race if it does.

I have a hard time sometimes distinguishing what people are thinking because part of American humor seems to be to make fun of someone, exaggerating events that occurred, just to pump people up. To give an example outside of politics, my college had a host of legends and rumors about a university in a neighboring town. We actually didn&#39;t compete in any meaningful way. They were D-II and had a way better athletics program, so we had no chance at all as we were a D-III private school with a focus on academics. Most of our sports facilities were super-old, and sports was just ill-funded. Academically, there might have been some competition, but honestly on that front, there was a lot more collaboration. They were a lot larger, so they had a wider range of classes, and students from my college would take classes at the other university. But in spite of all that, there were all sorts of stupid stories, and everyone just laughed at them and knew the stories were false. I&#39;m not from the states, and this puzzled me a bit, but now I&#39;ve live here longer, I&#39;m sensing a pattern.

This is in the context of your reaction to this particular video and your view that we should be thankful for all the less intelligent people (tin foil hats). And now it seems to me that you're heading towards philosophical or religious trivia. I can only conclude that you believe in some sort of conspiracy theory and you think it's a good thing that many other people do the same.

You asked about the difference between intelligence and wisdom and now you're talking about an amount of knowledge and you're comparing apples to oranges. I can have 99.9% of all knowledge and a man with 0.1% of all kowledge will have less knowledge than me. There's no other conclusion you can draw from that. Yes, that person can be better att baking cookies than me, and yes, that person can be greater in size than me because he eats all the cookies. So when you say "better and greater than you" I don't know what you mean and how it's relevant. Intelligence is the ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills, and wisdom has more to do with experience and moral judgement, depending on how you want to define it. The problem with experience is that experiences are subjective, which means that we can have different perspectives and come to different conclusions and moral judgements based on the same information. That's why I would think that being wise can only truly mean something if the person in question is also very intelligent.

He is so stupid and demented that telling him anything that is a top-secret, he will not be able to keep quiet on (if he remembers it, at all).<br /><br />I hope Snopes is sued for all their lies.

They could hear loud and clear that Joe Biden admitted he and Obama had put together the most extensive and inclusive voter fraud organization in the history of American politics, yet they pretend that they heard nothing that should raise an alarm. They also have the audacity to admit to be with the Crooked Media without shame , just like Joe Biden admitted to have committed voter fraud without shame. They are disgusting and despicable.

I think he will lose this as he is far too arrogant about his fraud. He wishes he had a complete NWO wimp like Mitt Romney to have ran against him before but no he got Trump. The office of the President-elect? Seriously Biden? Wow. What a fool. Though he's certainly feeling those lawsuits hit his so called "administration" team I'm sure of it. He can't expect to get away with his criminality forever and that includes the major news networks who so obviously are covering for him each day. They will fall too most likely in their ratings after all of this as people will start to see how much they are covering for criminals like Biden instead of supporting morality.

How did so much, basically across the board systemic, democrat voter fraud take place with this newly constructed organization that fights voter fraud in america, brought into existence by barack obama and joe biden.. ?? <br /><br />Where.. please show me.. or post a link... or an article... or an address even.. hell, just the name of this voter fraud fighting organization would be a start..

Because it can get complicated, because the Republicans are doing everything they can to make it harder for people to vote — particularly people of color — to vote. So go to <a href="http://iwillvote.com/">IWILLVOTE.com</a>.<br />Secondly, we’re in a situation where we have put together, and you guys did it for our administration — President Obama’s administration before this — we have put together I think the most extensive and inclusive voter fraud organization in the history of American politics. What the president is trying to do is discourage people from voting by implying that their vote won’t be counted, it can’t be counted, we’re going to challenge it and all these things. If enough people vote, it’s going to overwhelm the system.<br />You see what’s happening now, you guys know it as well as I do, you see the long, long lines and early voting. You see the millions of people who have already cast a ballot. And so, don’t be intimidated. If in fact you have any, any problem go to — and I don’t have the number but it’s 833-DEM-VOTE. Call that number. We have over a thousand lawyers, over a thousand of them, they’ll answer the phone, if you think there’s any challenge to your voting. Go to 833-DEM-VOTE, dial those letters on your phone. That will get you the assistance that we have already put in place.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6u1uKznCYw&amp;t=20m33s">20:33</a>	UC84ElB84qMbfd0MoXc2k8UQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC84ElB84qMbfd0MoXc2k8UQ	0

Such an honor to serve a president that droned children in Pakistan. How great was it the you killed Ghadaffi and plunged Libya into chaos where they now have open slave markets. How awesome was it getting those 4 people killed in the embassy, and then blaming it on youtube videos? The wonderful time you had directing the IRS to target conservative groups. Must have been great when you sent $400 million to Iran. Or maybe it was the unprecedented warrantless spying on every American. Such a great president...

You only see what you wanna see Trump is a racist and he don't like ppl that aren't white if you didn't see that in the research you must not be very good at it then lol and I can't help you there. Biden and Obama have a much better character for president than Trump that's what most ppl care about they don't put ppl down if you don't agree with them or call them names or be a bully and tweet all day wtf is that for a president. Biden has not been president in 47 years this will be his first time in there as president and he will have a chance at fixing the mess the country is because of Trump and his administration. Trump don't know how to treat people that is his biggest problem and you gain a lot of enemies that way. Look at all the ppl he has fired all those ppl are against him now who were once for him. Also even if Trump did some good things or passed some good things all that was drowned out with the hatred and division he has caused in this country between the left and right who now pretty much can't stand each other and attack one another when around each other. It was not like this before he added fuel to the fire for his political show and didn't give a fuck about others who he disrespected. His biggest downfall was how he handled Covid in case you are not aware the US leads the world in cases and deaths because Trump chose to ignore the virus and its seriousness with his rallies and saying its no big deal and telling dumbass ppl to drink bleach to make it go away. You know how many families lost loved ones because HE DID NOTHING in terms of prevention and instructing the country how to navigate this virus as a president or any leader should do? There is no getting around that and that alone means he failed as a president. Not to mention he had no social distancing and barely any masks for any event or briefing he held furthermore, infected the white house and those around him even those who worked for him with the virus without a care in the world, the guys a selfish idiot like his base and nothing you say will change my mind about that. He just needs to help Biden transition in as the next president now but he won't even do that as any normal president would do once they lost so he needs to get out of there, bottom line. 78 million ppl plus are fed up with him and his supporters they don't want to see him or them anymore. Biden and his team have to go in the white house and disinfect and wipe down everything because the virus has spread there and who knows how many surfaces its on thanks to Mr. Trump and his selfish egotistic attitude.

Show me one clip or anything of him saying something that hurt a minority ? Ill wait . That's what the MSM wants you to believe. Obama built the cages that separated children . Type in Snopes "who built the cages" . Then type in who vetoed the Super Predator crime bill ! Type in your Google Machine , deportation rates of presidents . You see it's not about feel good PC speeches. It's about real actions that hurt real people. Not their feelings . Does Trump say stupid things that hurt people feelings ? Yes he has , but his actions are what matter . He vetoed the Super Predator crime bill , he got the economy strong and unemployment for blacks and people of color the lowest unemployment in years , he stopped the kids in cages , after Melania told him to. He's not perfect but at least he doesn't just tell everyone what they want to hear. He actually does something about it . Obama bailed out all the big banks while kicking 5.1 million people out of their homes . The left only cares about making you feel good with speeches. They only want our vote. Please tell me what Joe Biden has done in 47 years that are good for people . Or tell me what policies he is proposing that you feel will be good for our country.

He&#39;s aged so badly I can almost see the blood pumping slowly around his body, he forgets where is and what he&#39;s doing after standing up for a few minutes, it&#39;s insanely creepy to watch him around kids and women. <br /><br />Beating Trump isn&#39;t a big deal, I think a lamppost could have got more votes. I bet he knew every question that was going to be asked here before hand, he doesn&#39;t write his own speeches, he doesn&#39;t write his own tweets. I&#39;d not be surprised if you opened his face you&#39;d find one of those tiny aliens from Men In Black operating his body.

What he means you clowns, is that our current system gives access to voters that are deliberately being called fraudulent. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />He even explains how Donald Trump can mediate the election by closing booths, and spreading deceit just by exploiting his position as president. This oxymoron is meant to show how very ignorant people can fall for the fallacies of a man. And instead of looking into at all the obvious conspiries our current president is spitting, you have to focus on such a small event made by our president-elect. Please instead of coming to this video just to look at this one sentence, you should reconsider your role as a US voter, because obviously sheep play a no larger role than just to be harvested by our politicians.

It has been debunked many times.<br /><br />He didn&#39;t do squat in 47 years, other than pass a crime bill that imprisoned thousands of African Americans. He isn&#39;t going to &quot;put pressure&quot; on anything.<br /><br />Renewable energy cost millions more to keep going. Ask northern OH, or anywhere else they have tried that garbage.<br /><br />You won&#39;t get Elon to sign over the electric automobile industry to you. 🤣<br /><br />You cannot control a virus. That is just ignorant. <br /><br />We already far outcompete the rest of the world. That is why people come here to learn.<br /><br />You are not going to &quot;cure cancer&quot; you make too much money off of it then to do so. 😂<br />(You aren&#39;t curing alzheimers either)<br /><br />The amazon doesn&#39;t even create 20% of the Earth&#39;s oxygen. Yes it should stop being burned, and subjected to deforestation. The Paris accord was turned down, and that is a GREAT deal, that millions were happy for being pulled out of.<br /><br />Barrack was arguably one of the worst presidents in American history.<br /><br />Voting is not complicated, and Republicans did absolutely nothing to diminish the people&#39;s ability to vote.<br /><br />🤣, yes, you absolutely did... &quot;We have put together, I think, the most extensive and inclusive voter fraud organization in the history of American politics.&quot;<br />(Nobody took this statement out of context. I have watched this several times now. There is was in no way any context removed or missed.)<br /><br />Yep, the illegal votes, dead voters, and &quot;HAMMER&quot; protocol &quot;SCORECARD&quot; showed up on Biden&#39;s behalf.

It is absolutely wrong to allow children to decide whether or not to mutilate themselves at 8 or 12 years old to change to a different orientation (sex). It&#39;s absolutely wrong to allow communistic socialists to steal property from people to give to the poor. It&#39;s absolutely wrong to force people to have taxation without representation.

There will be fossil fuels for the wealthier, if not just the rich under Biden as president. The rest of the population will be used to test further alternative power experimenting, suffering financial hardship. Certainly, we can’t just dump fossil fuels currently and switch to alternative energies that need much more improvement before it is forced unto the population.

People use mail-in because they have moved far away, because they don't want wait hours in queues, etc, whatever reasons that are bipartisan. Fear of Covid is common to all human beings. Dead people voted. Unsolicited ballots were sent. Back-dated. Fake signature. Double votes. I was wondering why the Dems were so silent, so calm, the last week, when Trump was rallying 5 times a day.

This resulted in Democrats overwhelmingly voting by mail while Republicans mostly voted in person.

He was so convinced he’d win that now he’s totally convinced this was stolen. You only need to look at the music and dancing all around the county and possibly the world. In the UK we blew horns.

WOW! u told on yourself. TRUMP found many voter fraud cases. and he had every right by law to dispute the votes and have a re-count. George Bush had 37 days to recount.

Also 10 out of the 12 cases has already been thrown out by courts due to lack of evidence. This is pretty consistent with the media saying there is not evidence. If there was so much of it why haven't we seen it yet? You still haven't even linked cases of voter fraud.

Because it can get complicated, because the Republicans are doing everything they can to make it harder for people to vote — particularly people of color — to vote. So go to <a href="http://iwillvote.com/">IWILLVOTE.com</a>.<br /><br />Secondly, we’re in a situation where we have put together, and you guys did it for our administration — President Obama’s administration before this — we have put together I think the most extensive and inclusive voter fraud organization in the history of American politics. What the president is trying to do is discourage people from voting by implying that their vote won’t be counted, it can’t be counted, we’re going to challenge it and all these things. If enough people vote, it’s going to overwhelm the system.<br /><br />You see what’s happening now, you guys know it as well as I do, you see the long, long lines and early voting. You see the millions of people who have already cast a ballot. And so, don’t be intimidated. If in fact you have any, any problem go to — and I don’t have the number but it’s 833-DEM-VOTE… Call that number. We have over a thousand lawyers, over a thousand of them, they’ll answer the phone, if you think there’s any challenge to your voting. Go to 833-DEM-VOTE, dial those letters on your phone. That will get you the assistance that we have already put in place.&quot;<br /><br />When Biden used the phrase “voter fraud organization,” he was referring to the systems put into place to help people who have trouble voting. He wasn’t admitting to voter fraud.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2020/10/viral-posts-take-biden-quote-on-voter-fraud-out-of-context/">https://www.factcheck.org/2020/10/viral-posts-take-biden-quote-on-voter-fraud-out-of-context/</a>	UCPW0-K_OfM17fzGCSodNswA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPW0-K_OfM17fzGCSodNswA	0

Especially after this most recent Trump call to Georgia. They need to investigate the ENTIRE election. If Election integrity is the goal, then the whole Election needs investigating. I want to see where all Trump committed fraud. We know for a fact Biden didn't commit fraud in the swing states, you know, cause they can't find evidence of any fraud. Oh, except for the 3 people arrested in PA for voter fraud who voted for Trump. If Hunter Biden did anything wrong, then his ass needs to go to prison, however, I still haven't seen the evidence of this laptop and let's be honest, the story they gave about the chain of custody of that laptop DOES NOT MAKE SENSE!!! Idk why you guys continue to believe Trump. 2016 Election that he won he said Hillary committed voter fraud and they'd prosecute her. Where's that? Oh that's right, 2 republican committees couldn't find any fraud on behalf of Dems from that election. He said Mexico would pay for the wall. Lol, we're still paying for it. He's given us so many different dates on when they're going to show their evidence for the voter fraud of the 2020 Election that I've lost track. First it was Safe Harbor day, then it was Dec 14th, now it's Jan 6th. What's it going to be after that? You Trumpers are so lost. I feel sorry for you guys. You worship at the alter of a man that doesn't give a shit about you.

I dunno if we have watched the same clip but this is absolutely not taken out of context. I've heard this claim elsewhere and had to see it for myself. Nowhere does this mention voter fraud of the sort...the question was, of course, regarding voters and how they could vote to allow him to become the next president. the answer goes from "make a plan how you're gonna vote, when you're gonna vote. the republicans are making it increasingly more difficult for you to vote" to "You guys did it for my- president obama's adminsitration. We have put together...I think the most...Extensive and inclusive...voter fraud organization in the history of American politics." Stop making excuses for politicians.

Don&#39;t mix air, ground, and water pollution with normal cycles in weather patterns which have been happening for thousands of years--long before fossil fuels existed.<br /><br />Stay away from the Paris Climate Accord--a big farce! It&#39;s all about money, power, and control! This is a giant red flag and one of many reasons not to vote for Biden! Biden&#39;s voter fraud scheme should scare all voters and now since the election, that scam is being unmasked. Why is law enforcement ignoring it?<br /><br />&quot;We have put together, I think, the most extensive and inclusive voter fraud organization in the history of American politics.&quot; <br /><br />Jimmy Carter was delighted to learn that Obama won the Presidency 2008. It was a great relief for Jimmy to know that he was no longer the worst president in the history of America. Obama replaced Jimmy as the all time worst president! Biden was part of that failed presidency for 8 long years!	UCpRjFCEtg1wRfIUv9JXOSmA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpRjFCEtg1wRfIUv9JXOSmA	0

You find your polling place, show up with ID (or not in some states), register if you haven&#39;t, and vote. Easy. This idea that certain ppl have made it too hard is insulting to anyone with half a brain. Then again, that&#39;s not the demographic Biden wishes to get. He prefers dead and dumb.

The most serious problem is call China 🇨🇳, not only they don’t abide to any policy to control climate change, they polude more than any nation in the world, we depend on them for many products including those for Covit like masks, tests, etc so Joe better be up to the task to face them square. China does have the largest army in the world and as you can see they are bullying other countries already so if you want respect from them we better have a strong military. If he bans fracking too soon and the word banning is out of context because the appropriate action would be to replace cleaner energy sources is something else. If fracking is banned we better learn to speak Chinese, there is no way fracking can be replaced in a 4 year period. The new technology is more expensive ... search it up! Do the fact check and judge for yourself if it is a feasible in the next 4 yrs or is just political talk to get more votes.

He's an old man. I didn't even get skeptical about anything when he said that because I already knew he meant that his and Obama's administration set up a massive inclusive anti voter fraud organization. The claims of "fraud" have been debunked by the Supreme Court. Anyone who also truly followed politics would know that. These comments claiming "Biden exposed himself" are really just people trying to pushing a right wing agenda, use your brains guys.

He also said don't be discouraged to vote by mail which Trump said you shouldn't so he could get more votes in person which is the whole reason he lost, Biden really encouraged the mail in vote and Trump said the opposite and he wonders why he lost lol!!. Its funny how easy ppl can be fooled by not taking into account the whole context of what he is saying. People like to cut bits and pieces out here and there to make it look like he said something else, nice try but once again FAIL. Trump lost and that's it. His main message here is not to be intimidated to VOTE that is the whole point of this lol. He also encouraged ppl who could not get to polls in person to vote by mail. HIS MAIN MSG TO HIS BASE.....VOTE EARLY, which is exactly what they did. Our democracy is at stake, all true words he spoke which Trump and his ppl like to ignore, they take a part of what he said lol and cut out the rest. Learn to comprehend and take the whole of what he is saying into account.	UCqKXnBKnVKHqKAjVGpInA7Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqKXnBKnVKHqKAjVGpInA7Q	1	Ugyb-jk0fGChQHPfwlh4AaABAg	osyrys official

This is most evident with what he continues to say afterward: "what the president is trying to do is discourage people from voting by implying your vote won't be counted...It will be challenged ... if you have any problems call DEMVOTE." Then he says hell connect them to a lawyer if their vote is challenged. (This would be voter fraud since votes would be unlawfully challenged). I can see why people took it the other way but your interpretation doesn't make sense when you take into account what Biden said afterward.

No, battery technology will not replace weeks of power for your house in the near future. no practicle battery will have that capacity any time soon. complete BS. he is full of it, and these “interviewers” challamge nothing he says. “get control of the virus” sounds great, but how sleepy joe? Your socialist buddies in Europe aren’t doing better, so aside from masks, which everyone is already wearing, what’s your big plan joe? Saying green infrastructure over and over does not solve anything. Alzheimers? joe is going to solve every medical problem known to humans? pay farmers to put land in land bank?we already do that joe. Oh, we will pay brazil not to wreck rainforests? really? Why didn’t you and ol’ BO try that 11 years ago? joe? Rejoin Paris climate accord, letting joe”s commie buddies scam the world , like china does with everything else, like the agreements on not trading in endangered species, when all the world black market trade is in/to/from china. they lie, cheat, and steal our IP also, joe”s chinese’s buddies. What of these “plans” have you worked on in the last 47 years joe?

Most Biden supporters don't care about Trump or his supporters enough to do the same or watch him or care enough about his supporters to know what they are about or what they are up to.

Either way Biden won Trump lost so not sure what you are getting at lol. Holding on to a lost cause maybe I don't know. LOL you sound like another one of those Trump Conspiracy theorists no thanks I'm good you can have those to yourself. NO comments are allowed cuz u got a lot of Trump HATEFUL idiots that just wanna spam hate comments and pretty much talk shit to Biden and anyone supporting him. Those people are still butthurt Trump lost so you can't really have a civil discussion with any of them. So I support that why give these lunatics a voice to trash the PRESIDENT which is what he is now whether people like it or not. Not every Biden supporter uses YouTube buddy lol. Also, I mean so what you are arguing over views and likes on YouTube do you not see how dumb and childish that sounds??? lol. Typical of Trump ppl though to argue and state their points over something so insignificant. He already won he already is president who cares how many people watch him on YouTube lol. His policies and what he does with the country to fix Trump's mess is all that matters at this point you got your priorities all mixed up bud fix them.

And Trump supporters would use those same alternate media sources as well in proportionate numbers. The ratios are basically 3 to 1 in online media support Trump to Biden. Youtube is literally DELETING downvotes off Biden videos (and notice NO COMMENTS are allowed on Biden videos (why that, hmm?)). Screenshots: 2K Upvotes to 10K downvotes - then 45 minutes later the same video has 3.2K upvotes and only 2K downvotes. It's laughable.

LOL maybe they watched him on other outlets or on TV or maybe they don't need to watch him to know what he stands for and that he isn't Trump lol. Someone who compares views though as to how much support a president has obviously is very small/narrow minded so I don't expect you to understand. There are a lot more ways to support somebody than just with "views" bud. Either way voters showed their support by turning out and voting for him in the election NOT IN PERSON but by mail. 80 million people plus who voted for him MOST FOR ANY CANDIDATE in history may I add should tell you that much if you use whatever brain you possess.

There has never been any evidence, in any election, of anyone being able to pull of more than a few hundred votes at best, an getting caught at it. You are so brainwashed that you think it's possible to steal an election by millions of votes? This isn't 2000, where it came down to 500 votes in one state. This is tens of thousands of votes across several states. Nobody would even repeat this nonsense if it wasn't for the fact that the president himself has been spewing it for so long because he's a fragile sad loser.

Trump can't handle that and his ppl are still in denial/shock he actually is going to lose. Now Trump is trying to block the Biden team from getting critical information for the virus to save American lives, reverse shit in his favor when clearly Biden won, throw out millions of LEGAL votes for Biden cuz he don't understand what mail in ballots are and being a dick trying to put pro republican ppl everywhere attempting to call senators and reps to not allow certification of LEGAL wins in States and he even tried to get his ppl to take away mail slots prior to the election to discourage voting that way. HE IS DOING ALL THIS SHIT OUT IN THE OPEN trying to steal/fraud an election so ya, that's what I care about. Biden and Kamala will be in the White House January 2021 can't wait, tired of Trump his ppl and their antics the Republicans would not accept his behavior if it were the other way around. You can tell your mom that the person she voted for and the dems did not cheat nothing to worry about there, Biden will become the 46th president of the USA and how sweet that is to say. Also, question for you did Trump ppl wait till the investigation was over in 2016 if Russia helped Trump win before declaring him the winner?? No I don't think so they just accepted it and called the investigation a witch hunt, exactly what this is right now a witch hunt. So what is the difference now, cuz its not going well for Trump lol?? Everyone else is supposed to wait for this witch hunt to declare Biden winner?? When in 2016 Trump or his ppl didn't give two shits about an on going investigation into Russian help to get him elected. At the time they said no we are the winner we don't care about no investigation its nonsense. So ya Biden won that's just what it is no matter what they do the result will not change, I'm confident that Biden won and LEGALLY too. The right and the republicans are a big bunch of hypocrites and liars who are in denial enabling Trump's sore loser/selfish attitude because he did not win. Time to move on and get him outta there in a couple months, can't wait actually.

Trump fucked up the country in 4 years don't know what you are talking about. Racism is rampant, riots, division amongst people, attacking of immigrants in a supposed inclusive country, hatred and not accepting of others or RESPECTING of others is at an all time high, I wouldn't say Trump did that well. Oh and the biggest one of all Trump completely fucked how he handled the virus the US lead the WORLD in cases and deaths, Trump ignored the virus for months and ignored scientists and shamed them. He held rallies and briefings WITH NO social distancing OR masks when he knew how serious this thing was. So uhhhhh ya I will stick to my original statement thanks. That's not even getting into what he did by separating children from their families WHO THEN COULD NOT REUNITE with their families because they did not know where they were or where they were being kept/held. Now Biden has to go in there FOR THE FIRST TIME as president and fix Donald's mess and how he left the country, and on top of that Donald is being a BIG SORE LOSER/baby right now and not even helping Biden's transition like any other normal president would do he is only being difficult and delaying the process while still totally ignoring the HUGE pandemic problem going on. Anyways I think you get my point Trump left the country in a disaster which now ANOTHER administration has to clean up and try and get the country back on track.

They are not renewable energy production. <br />We are going to be finished if we go down the path of solar panels and wind turbines. You have to understand <br />solar panels are not recyclable and either are wind turbine blades. They all end up in landfills and that is not renewable.<br />Someone needs to wake these people up. Ask Germany about reducing their carbon footprint and the waste generated.<br />Where is all the copper for all of these electric cars and infrastructure coming from? Where is all of the silver coming from?<br />This entire plan of going electric is a pipe dream that know one has actually planned and thought how this is going to work!<br />People we need to wake up and don’t go chasing these dreams without knowing how this is going to work? US oil production is collapsing and the end of fracking is here. Non of these people make any sense technology does not increase your EROI.<br />People you need to read more and understand that are finished if we go down this road.

Wind turbine blades don’t have a chance in hell to be recycled! Epoxy resins, fiber glass, plastic, metal and more all fused together they will never ever be recycled. Copper demand is scheduled to go up 50% per year every year for the next 5-8 years. It may be in the earths crust and it is but the mines set to mine copper and the scheduled mines to be in operation in the next 10 years will not have the capacity to deliver the demand. Research how long it takes to get a mine going and the output of every copper mine on the planet and take demand up 50% per year and it is game over in 5-6 years. All these guys are clowns and they think that mining is evil on top of it and believe me they all use diesel fuel by the billions of gallons and with US oil production falling off a cliff which was responsible for 80% of the worlds oil production increase over the last 10 years you will understand we are off the cliff with oil. How are you going to mine when oil is $200 a barrel? How will the economy function? It is limping now at $40.00 or less per barrel. Read and read more you will understand we are near the end of the days of cheap energy. That changes copper, silver , gold and all metal costs which will affect everything electric . It is almost game over you cannot consume like you were when your energy production is falling big time. The US will be down 4 ,million barrels a day by this time next year and down 7-8 by this time in 2 years that oil production allowed us to recover from 2008-2009 what is going to save us this time? Fracking is done even at $150 a barrel we used 90% of what was there already.	UCZCk0orQI0b8ZxonwutQzUA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZCk0orQI0b8ZxonwutQzUA	1	UgwfedX3cZ5EM-nE4PR4AaABAg	Tony

Copper? Copper is abundant in the Earth's crust and is used for wiring and oftentimes for electric motors. Silver is used in electric windows, electrically-adjustable seats, heated seats and coats contacts.

Copying and editing videos to take the things people say out of context. <br /><br />Trump says &quot;Joe Biden brags about having “the most extensive and inclusive VOTER FRAUD organization” in history.&quot;, but after seeing the full video you can clearly see that Biden and the democrats predicted that Trump would challenge mail-in ballots, try and stop the voting process, cause widespread voting fraud hysteria and erode our democracy. <br /><br />Clearly the context Biden was getting out is that he created an organization to protect everyone&#39;s voting rights and that every vote is counted. <br /> <br />The presidential race is no longer a battle between republicans and democrats but a fight to save America and its democracy and put an end to the MAGA movement once and for all. <br /> <br />MAGA (Make America&#39;s Government Authoritarian) because he is one, and huge fan of Saudi Arabia. He wants to run the government his way with hopes that his people will help him accomplish this.	UCpS-X1EYEjcA6Xt9IX9CHZA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpS-X1EYEjcA6Xt9IX9CHZA	0

Pfeiffer asked what Biden would say to people who haven’t voted yet or don’t have a plan to vote. In response, Biden gave a three-part answer. He first encouraged people to create a plan by going to IWillVote.com, a site hosted by the Democratic National Committee.

So misspeaking isn't necessarily a sign of poor health. That being that being said. This a more accurate understanding of what he meant:he meant voter fraud organization in the same way someone can say a lung cancer organization and mean lung cancer (prevention) organization. This is most evident with what he continues to say afterward: "what the president is trying to do is discourage people from voting by implying your vote won't be counted...It will be challenged ... if you have any problems call DEMVOTE." Then he says hell connect them to a lawyer if their vote is challenged. (This would be voter fraud since votes would be unlawfully challenged). I can see why people took it the other way but your interpretation doesn't make sense when you take into account what Biden said afterward. He should have added prevention to avoid the misunderstanding.	UCHdWFsnEdzrwQysaWYhJRhw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHdWFsnEdzrwQysaWYhJRhw	1	UgxGoqo9CPy-4nrmvch4AaABAg	Dro Down

Chris Wallace, the debate host, was a democrat, and he never speaks abt the good that Trump has done. Arnon Michigan (idk if I spelled the name right) is a democrat in charge of deciding what states will be predicted. For example, if he feels that Arizona will be fore Biden, they call it as a blue state. And yes, that is an important thing to keep in mind. They called Arizona for Biden way to early. Conservative voters didn’t even care to vote because they see that they are so far behind. And you know what’s funny about people who talk shit ONLY about Fox News. Those are the same people who claim to watch real news, then go home and watch CNN, MSNBC, The Washington Post, NPR, Vox, etc. And by the way, Tucker Carlson is one of the few Fox people that states out right factual information. Yes, most of the time it’s only good things about Trump, but during a time where 80% of major news media is against Trump, someone has to even it out. Tucker is perfect for that.

MONTET	@Pontus Årfelt Yes I totally agree with you, it is easy for me to say "it's a figure of speech", but I couldn't find the interview of that campaign and I can't stop to think that they took it out of context like they like it so much to make it sound racist or whatever. But if you want to think that they are dumb enough to say to journalist that they will prevent people from voting, that's your choice. And I'm sorry I can't agree with you on that one, if you have read the definition of voter suppression, how does it fit in ? It is basic strategy to win an argument, either you give a better argument or you discredit your opponent or your opponent's argument, which is what they did thanks to the predator video of Ms. Hillary. Now when trump says don't vote with mail because mailbox won't be sanitized...I can agree it sounds like voter suppression, even if he is not actually telling them to not vote at all. And finally to your example, i understand what you mean, but you gotta keep in mind that everyone is not a die hard trump supporter or a die hard Biden supporter, and that kind of move is to get those people who are swinging from dem to rep or rep to dem... Finally if the people are indeed discouraged to vote because of what they saw about their candidate, maybe there is a problem about that candidate. I'd rather be fully informed about my candidate (the good and the bad), than living in an utopic world where my candidate is the best because he/she is democrat or republican...

Well, we're all free to believe whatever we want. Showing ads to discredit your opponent is not about changing the vote, it's a voter suppression tactic. Trump-supporters would NEVER vote for Biden, but if Biden kept pushing anti-Trump ads, then maybe some Trump-supporters would consider not voting at all. And this goes both ways. And politicians are very much aware of this.	UCiILdnlB2l-h0oCdejufYxQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiILdnlB2l-h0oCdejufYxQ	1	UgxYdvR1RuHd8tl10Ol4AaABAg	Longhair88

MONTET	@Pontus Årfelt I'm glad we agree that this was more of a political targeting than a racial targeting like the media were so eager to sell it. But nonetheless, funny how you give random sources without reading them, "hoping they won't vote" was probably a figure of speech to say they are likely to vote against D. Trump. And again, showing them anti-Hillary ads has nothing to do with "stoping" them to vote and everything to do with changing their mind on Hillary. This is political campaigning, which has nothing to do with voter suppression : "The tactics of voter suppression range from minor changes to make voting less convenient, to physically intimidating and even physically attacking prospective voters, which is illegal. Voter suppression can be effective if a significant number of voters are intimidated or disenfranchised." If you don't see there that this has nothing to do with what they did, then I will never be able to explain it to you.

"One of the categories was named ‘Deterrence’, which was later described publicly by Trump’s chief data scientist as containing people that the campaign “hope don’t show up to vote” ".

Is my interpretation right? You need a reality check. I guess you don't work in IT. You know, facebook is run on 4 cylinder diesel engines, unlike google that still use petrol. Bruh, I'm messing with you, they both actually run on pixie dust and their datacenters are located in the Teletubbies headquarters.

Since like May Trump was saying "vote, if you do it by mail then go vote in person" He's not discouraging anyone. And the reason he said "vote in person, if it accepted your mail in, you'll be given a provisional. Fill out that provisional to make sure your vote is yours." That's saying to invalidate the mail in by voting in person with a provisional JUST IN CASE the mail in was captured and altered. even in this interview biden is fear mongering with the COVID alarm to make people vote by mail so as to GIVE ROOM TO STEAL THE ELECTION WITH FORGED/FAKE MAILED BALLOTS.

And women are great, I love women, don't you?. We were even born from a woman, so what is wrong with talking like women?, are you some sort of religious bigot that need women submissive to get laid?.

Oh, that is easy, they put less voting places near black communities, so they have to take more time in line to vote. I remember one case where the power went out in a voting place for hours, it's stuff like that. More or less the same reasons they are more affected by Covid. It has also to do with housing, mortgages, it's really deep and systemic. A known racist, for instance, built a bridge in a main road, but he built it low enough so busses can't go below it, knowing that black and poor people use public transportation more. I can't remember the details, but it's stuff like this.	UCwIvJmN5M9T661NtyQ8SKew	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwIvJmN5M9T661NtyQ8SKew	1	UgwYTBa4srW_H81KOGZ4AaABAg	Longhair88

I&#39;m all for cleaning up our wasteful ways but nothing has been done in previous years. Why do we have nuclear power when the waste is toxic for ever not to mention the risk when a catastrophe happens, Chernobyl, Fukushima. How are the northern population going to hear their homes and how are populations that live in less sunny climates, like Washington going to benefit from solar.? And as for socialism you show me one example of anywhere it has worked to improve the lives of any person. If you are afraid of this virus then why haven&#39;t you been afraid of all the past ones just as serious? If you are afraid of this virus the you will be muzzled and distanced for the rest of your young lives. Great way to live! I&#39;m 60 and have had all the previous viruses through my lifetime and recovered. This world saddens me for many reasons but mostly because of the division I see happening. If we truly want changes we need to pull together even in our diversity of ideals . We need more freedoms not more government.

That is no option 3. You are either being deliberately deceitful or you are a bit dumb. <br /><br />Do you also think FIREFIGHTERS are a group that go around with flamethrowers?<br />Do you think the DOMESTIC ABUSE CENTER is where drunk men go to hit their wives?<br />Do you understand the difference between knowing your shit and knowing you&#39;re shit?<br /><br />I can understand people being duped by the edited clip because that was it&#39;s purpose. To play to democrat hating minds who are looking for things that confirm their believes. But this!? In context? You have to be stupid to misunderstand this. Actually fucking stupid.

I'm glad I could amuse you. I will be laughing when Trump is outta the white house and facing all the legal trouble that awaits him after. As well as seeing all his dumbass zombie like supporters still out there chanting Trump 2020! when its 2021 lmao!!! That should be a hoot I can't wait for that actually. But as I said I'm glad I could offer you some sort of entertainment was not my goal but hey I feel the same way watching the Trump disaster go down like the Titanic in his final days in office bringing everyone down with him. What a stupid sad man he is lol, I'm gonna have my popcorn ready should be a hoot to watch him and his deranged supporters implode on themselves even more WHEN MORE things don't go their way.

They USED mail in votes cuz the world is in the middle of a pandemic with the US having really bad numbers that's what everyone except Trump ppl know apparently lol. They also knew alot of ppl would vote against Trump and asked their people to vote that way so THEY DID NOT COME IN TO CONTACT with the virus going into the crowds to vote like Trump ppl did without a care in the world for others. Biden surpassed expectations 81 million PLUS PPL voted for him most votes in president elect history to get that crook Trump out of the White House. The whole world knows Trump is a thief and a liar who puts down his allies. His family are a bunch of cons as well. Yes the world does know this now its clear more than ever with his sore loser babyish attitude and the attitude of his lunatic base who are threatening violence against democrats and those who voted for Biden and are celebrating his win. The video where they apparently locked out Republicans has been debunked and you sound like another conspiracy theorist. LIES, MISINFORMATION, BASELESS CLAIMS, and YOUR THEORIES don't hold up in the courts of LAW. That's why Trump is winning NO CASE and they can't prove their so called evidence in the courts. In court you cannot LIE and say whatever you want as "FACT" sorry lol. Show me where this so called "evidence" and videos they have are apparently PROVEN TO BE FACTUAL in the court of law show me a LINK where it has been proven in the court to be true and where the Trump team are winning these cases?? I will wait....or are you just talking shit you can't prove in court like the rest of the Trump side??? You and your husband really sound like "smart" people lol what a piece of work, glad Trump is out soon lol so we don't have to deal with can't think for yourselves ppl like you guys who believe everything Trump and his ppl tell you. The only crook who is going to pay for his crimes is Trump after this with the lawsuits that are going to come his way after all this and for making up baseless claims and filing fraudulent lawsuits to try and get his way like the con he is. HE STILL HAS NOT SHOWN his taxes btw in 4 years lol. What is he hiding there?? The truth will come out soon enough. Trump may be the first US criminal president to go down for Tax Fraud and Tax Evasion. Don the con and #DiaperDon are trending right now. His family are also crooks and did some shady shit that must be investigated as well. Republicans should also PAY for allowing trumps behavior to continue when they know damn well they would not accept it if it were the other way around. Bunch of hypocrites and enablers they are for allowing Trump to try and fraud and steal an election away from president elect Biden the candidate the PEOPLE voted for as the next president. Oh and btw TRUMP LOST!!!!BY ALOT!!!! actually 7 Million votes or so to be exact. THE WHOLE WORLD KNOWS THIS ACTUALLY except the RIGHT, and Trump and his team of idiots. Cuz even some Republicans are coming around to see that Biden won by a landslide and that Trump is a failure and a LOSER who is about to be out soon. Good riddance half the country are fed up with him and his supporters. Btw Fun Fact: Trump is the only president in history to LOSE the popular vote TWICE!! lol. Hey at least he will be remembered for that not to mention being the most pathetic cry baby of an outgoing president ever in the history of the US. Nobody has ever seen a cry baby like this before that's for sure. Anyways I'm happy Mr. One Term Trump will soon be gone, YES the whole world is breathing a sigh of relief for that one. Good day to you.	UCqKXnBKnVKHqKAjVGpInA7Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqKXnBKnVKHqKAjVGpInA7Q	1	UgzUXdj-QIy9FyjQ3ol4AaABAg	MG23

My husband predicted months that they were using the mail in ballot scheme to try and cheat and he was 💯% correct going to cheat. It's time to make these crooks pay. Trump won.

Myron Cowher and Dmitry Kupershmidt were found guilty of attempting to rig a May 2014 election in the private community of Wild Acres Lakes. According to Wild Acres Property Manager Robert Depaolis, Cowher approached him and asked him to provide Cowher with ballots that were due to be mailed to property owners in the community who seldom voted, for the express purpose of filling out those ballots and guaranteeing victory for Cowher’s preferred Board of Directors candidates. Depaolis went to the state police, who surveilled a meeting where Depaolis handed over the ballots, catching Cowher in the act of filling out the mail-in ballots. He was arrested and subsequently convicted on 217 counts, including forgery, identity theft, and criminal conspiracy. His accomplice, Kupershmidt, was found guilty on 190 counts. Cohwer received a sentence of between 18 months and four years in a state correctional facility, and was ordered to pay a $10,850 fine. Kuperschmidt’s sentencing has been delayed due to a change in attorneys.	UC0fELZNmdfIxYnNXBbtAYIA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0fELZNmdfIxYnNXBbtAYIA	1	UgzUXdj-QIy9FyjQ3ol4AaABAg	MG23

Trump LOST! he isn't going to reverse anything the same way they didn't reverse it when Russia helped him win in 2016. Biden won the electoral college and the popular vote by more than 6 million votes...so whatever the final vote tally is it will be in Biden's favor regardless.

Now if you can somehow find the votes he needs to win what are you waiting for, present them????Biden is the president elect you moron lol hello??? so Trump is a baby and a sore loser as he has not even acknowledged that fact yet and almost EVERYONE else has. Only his base him and Republicans are stupid enough to think he has a chance still, HE IS DONE...So losing with dignity is a concept I guess you or Trump have not grasped yet. No other president before him would be acting this way. This idiot is gonna wait till the last day he has to leave to actually tell Biden okay you beat me congrats but with how stupid he is, he probably won't even do that so YES! that makes him a sore loser and a baby his WHOLE base is not far behind or just very ignorant and disrespectful to Biden and his team. Everyone and their mother is telling Trump he lost or basically that he won't win lol even some Republicans so I mean It's just a matter of time. He must be either too thick headed or dumb to understand what YOU WILL LOSE means.	UCqKXnBKnVKHqKAjVGpInA7Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqKXnBKnVKHqKAjVGpInA7Q	1	UgzUXdj-QIy9FyjQ3ol4AaABAg	MG23

Were you there to see exactly how they did everything in all places lol? What's problematic is you have a sitting president who won't accept/acknowledge a loss and is still not telling his base he lost furthering their delusions/denial. No where in history has a US president acted the way this guy is acting right now, that's what he will be remembered for the guy who would not leave on his own accord, they gotta drag him outta there, he thought it would be his house forever. Most presidents would help the other guy transition in after a loss, not this guy though. Biggest sore loser and baby I have ever seen. Republicans and ppl around him are just accepting this type of behavior too when if it was the other way around they would be all over the guy for acting this way. He can't even be decent and congratulate Joe on the win. Losing with dignity was never in the cards for Trump. Even other world leaders are starting to accept Biden is the new guy and even ppl around Trump are telling him to concede I mean what more does this guy need to know he won't be the guy anymore, how dense is he? he lost lol, its okay it happens. Also its not Biden's fault that Trump spoke ill of mail in votes discouraging his base from voting that way causing them to mainly vote in person. Biden was smart to use mail in votes for his base mainly because of the PANDEMIC which Trump and his ppl seem to be unaware of or not giving a shit about that is going on. Good on Biden and his base they listened to advice from doctors and from the Biden team did their thing with the mail in votes came out in huge numbers for it to get Trump out. While the Trump ppl just listened to Trump his campaign and largely ignored advice from anyone outside of these ppl including the media. They came out the day of the election and pretty much that's it, now they wanna cry about a loss. Its done time is limited for Trump it will be his white house no longer in about two months time. Time to turn the page on Mr. One Term and welcome change, peace, tranquility, calm and direction back to the white house, the clown show is almost over. Its time to welcome in Biden and Kamala Harris the first female black VP in history.	UCqKXnBKnVKHqKAjVGpInA7Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqKXnBKnVKHqKAjVGpInA7Q	1	UgzUXdj-QIy9FyjQ3ol4AaABAg	MG23

"Trump said you shouldn't" - do you know the difference between an absentee ballot and mail-in ballot? "Trump lost and that's it." - the election results are not certified yet, how did you reach this conclusion? "democracy is at stake" - US is not a democracy, read the Constitution and the Federalist papers. "they take a part of what he said lol and cut out the rest" - exactly what the mainstream media does to Trump since day one.

He also said don't be discouraged to vote by mail which Trump said you shouldn't so he could get more votes in person which is the whole reason he lost, Biden really encouraged the mail in vote and Trump said the opposite and he wonders why he lost lol!!. Its funny how easy ppl can be fooled by not taking into account the whole context of what he is saying. People like to cut bits and pieces out here and there to make it look like he said something else, nice try but once again FAIL. Trump lost and that's it. His main message here is not to be intimidated to VOTE that is the whole point of this lol. He also encouraged ppl who could not get to polls in person to vote by mail. HIS MAIN MSG TO HIS BASE.....VOTE EARLY, which is exactly what they did. Our democracy is at stake, all true words he spoke which Trump and his ppl like to ignore, they take a part of what he said lol and cut out the rest.

President Trump never said or did anything to discourage anyone from voting LEGALLY, but he has expressed concern about votes being cast by those who aren't eligible. In many areas of the country, Democrats are openly in favor of non-citizens voting, so it's not hard to figure out what Biden meant when he said "If enough people vote, it's going to overwhelm the system." He was talking about the PLAN to do that. And they DID!	UCDLrq96H8ywRAgjXNSFIwew	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDLrq96H8ywRAgjXNSFIwew	1	UgzUXdj-QIy9FyjQ3ol4AaABAg	MG23

UgxElnFWr7JKkm1oIiR4AaABAg	6	5	2020-11-06 14:29:18	Francois Marchant	What he actually says : <br /><br />&quot;We have put together, and you guys did this for the Obama administration before this, i think the most extensive, inclusive voter fraud (Pause) organization in the history of american politics. What the president is trying to is discourage people from voting by implying their vote won&#39;t be counted, it can&#39;t be counted, we will challenge it. if enough people vote, it&#39;s going to overwhelm the system. You see what&#39;s happening now, you see the long, long lines and early voting, you see the millions already casting ballots. <br />Don&#39;t be intimitated, if in fact you have any problem, go to (gives the adress), call the number, we have over 100 lawyers that will answer the phone if you think your vote is being challenged.&quot;<br /><br />For those who struggle to understand this : this guy is 77 years old, and in multiple occurence he struggles to find his words in this interview. The moment he paused (after fraud), he clearly meant &quot;voter fraud CONTROL organization&quot;. And here&#39;s why : he&#39;s actually talking about a voter fraud control organization RIGHT AFTER THAT. <br /><br />The voter fraud he identifies is the intimidation tactics he references, the ones being used by Trump. And he wishes to inform people that there are lawyers available to combat those tactics, so that people can actually vote without any problem. <br /><br />Whether he is right or wrong about Trump frauding, I don&#39;t care. Whether he is actually frauding, I don&#39;t care. But using this sequence to PROVE that Biden is frauding is beyond stupid, it&#39;s intellectual fraud. You can&#39;t isolate a sentence and refuse to hear the rest, then claim that the sentence is revealing of a shocking truth. Please learn to listen to FULL SPEECHES and stop looking for individual sentences.	UC1SPJ-tmrBKSi_3WWnGBh9A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1SPJ-tmrBKSi_3WWnGBh9A	0

That is a very valid point, and i dont condone any anti-trump video pulling his sentences out of context, even though it admittedly happened a lot. My opinion of trump is based on the sentences i took in context, but it's more than enough to have a bad opinion of him. That being said : stating that Biden is to old to be president (he's only 3 years older than trump, but age works different for everyone) is point that can be heard. Stating that Biden "admitted that he pulled off an election fraud" is just ridiculous non-sense.

You are obviously oblivious to the tidal wave of corruption that has been gaining strength ever since Hillary&#39;s suspiciously deleted emails, Benghazi, and the entire team of Democratic corruption that has been exposed as a result of the fake Russia collusion lie. When this election snafu is settled, you better get a life jacket, because this wave will come crashing down and drown you in the reality of Justice. Climate change? Why not start with separating from Burisma in the oil &amp; gas industry. And the final thought is, you&#39;ve had 47 years to do all these wonderful things you speak of.

Ugy-SBOnVPJBMJVtKcJ4AaABAg.9FhqN7Iio2R9IZtoDajmph		0	2021-01-16 08:52:47	Matthew R	@Sherrie B so MSM speaks facts and pretty much every other credible news source NOT named OANN or NEWSMAXX in case you didn't know those aren't credible sources lol just to let you know in case you are confused which it seems like you are. Anyone can have a difference of opinion it don't matter who you are. You know why? Cuz no 2 people on this planet are exactly the same and we each have different experiences that shape the way we think and view the world. Even twins although they look the same probably aren't exactly the same in terms of how they think. I for one disagree with many of your talking points but it is what it is I'm not on here to try and change your mind. You think how you think and I will think how I think and that's fine by me. I disagree that MSM lies about everything. They may leave certain things out here and there and seem bias because they cover things the way they want to, however; that don't make them evil or dishonest or bad people as Trump would have you believe slandering the names of many of these AMERICANS as well who are part of the media. with this I agree with you down below "We are all Americans, wanting the same thing. Truth, Fairness & a fair wage. Stop the fighting". Although with the way people are acting towards one another not respecting one another and the differences amongst us I doubt it will happen anytime soon. Trump has caused this hate and division to become worse and now you are seeing the consequences of his actions and words the last 4 years. Thank him for how things are now between ppl. However in reality, my beef is with Trump and the supporters of his that want to cause violence and harm to anyone who likes Biden, the democrats and sees things not in the way they do. THAT is who my beef is with really. People are allowed not to like or listen to Trump you know, but if you listened to these people you would think otherwise. My beef is with people who can't accept Biden won fairly and THE WILL OF THE VOTERS for Biden, my beef is with people who want to take the country by force ignoring and not caring about the other half of the country who voted blue. These people act as if only those who voted for and wanted Trump matter and like everyone else is an enemy. THIS IS WRONG in case you are not aware. Why should I be surprised though Trump treated everyone who wasn't for him or agreed with him like the enemy for 4 years disrespecting, bullying, making fun of, threatening, belittling, berating and firing anyone that was in his way like a dictator. So its no surprise to me that many of his supporters see no wrong in acting this way themselves. Everyone else outside of this group though sees the wrong in their actions and takes responsibility for their own words UNLIKE Trump or his "ppl" which is truly sad imo.

You can even call their number 1-833-DEM-VOTE (1-833-336-8683) Also this is the website he is directly telling his supporters to go to if they had any questions or issues regarding their vote or the voting process. https://democrats.org/where-we-stand/the-issues/vote/ As well as this website below has also been referred to if people needed more assistance with getting their vote counted and information on HOW to actually vote. Also talks about important information regarding Covid-19. However, unlike the other two I linked this website is not specifically for Democrats or for people who voted for Biden, anyone could have used it but mentioning it is helpful to people who needed assistance with voting and other inquiries and did not know where else to turn. This website right here. https://www.eac.gov/ Anyways THAT is what Biden was talking about in this video. People do not understand what context is and like I said were jumping to conclusions because they did not understand what message Biden was trying to get across to his base. Which again was to VOTE EARLY and that they DON'T have to worry about fraud and their vote NOT COUNTING if they call the number I listed and go to those websites to help them with everything. Anyways I can't really make it much more clear than that lol. Most of these people I bet you never even bothered to do some research of their own on what he was actually talking about LOL!!. They just took a sentence or some words of what he said and are now acting like LOOK!!! you see lol he just admitted it there has to be fraud going on, he just said it!! lol. I would say hold on a second breathe, take the time to do some research do your due diligence educate yourself on what really is going on and what he was conveying to his supporters. Take the Trump glasses off for a second is what I would say to all those people who are stating the opposite of what I'm saying here lol. It might make you see things a bit more clearly if anything, and allow you not to overreact without knowing all the details first. Next time do some research first before you talk instead of believing something blindly without checking the facts BEHIND what is being talked about stop being a MINDLESS brainwashed clone like the rest of the ppl who see Trump as god. Use your brain for things other than talking nonsense you have no knowledge of. Be smarter okay hope I helped ya smh lol. You people are sad. Trump lost get over it and HE LOST FAIR AND SQUARE. Time to move on. Good day, and btw I see things clear as day I'm not brainwashed or misinformed whatsoever like you but thanks for your concern. Peace to you.

Sad thing is that Trump is trying to steal the election away from Biden when he won fair and square and trying to disenfranchise the votes of 80 million plus people who voted for Biden, like they don't matter. Trump has people and states playing along with his game confusing the American people even further just for his own gain talk about a selfish sad sac of a person. Sad thing is Trump would rather play golf than deal with the serious issues the country is facing like losing over 3000 people a day to Covid. Sad thing is Trump is a bully who separates kids from their families. Sad thing is Trump don't realize how much damage he causes with his lies, misinformation, and conspiracy theories. His base believes anything he says as fact. This is the REAL sad part. Sad part is Trump supporters like the proud boys are threatening the lives of Democrats and of those who voted for Biden. They think its a dictatorship and Trump was destined to win or something and like Biden had no right to win. Sad part is Trump don't even care about his supporters or RED STATES, he cares about ONLY himself and his crooked family and also ALL the cons he is pardoning under his watch before he leaves office. Sad part is instead of trying to unify and bring people together he wants to divide and put the red against blue even more so than they already are. Sad part is Trump disrespects and treats like garbage anyone who goes against his word or train of thought. Sad part is Trump always thinks he is right and like he can get away with anything just cuz he is president. Which he will surely find out CHANGES once you leave office and aren't so special anymore. He will pay for the things he has done and said, this I' am sure of. So are most Biden supporters and Democrats who think the way I do about good old orange Trump. Sad part is ultimately instead of caring about making America Great again he is like the titanic bringing everyone down with his sinking ship trying to destroy and undermine as much things as possible from the process before he has to leave later on this month. He is a disgrace and the REAL sad thing here, not those who voted for peace, leadership, direction, unity, calmness, tranquility acceptance of EVERY American not just White Americans or republicans as evidence by Biden's picks for cabinet as opposed to Trump's you will see a contrast there already. Sad reality was that Trump was a TV president for his base not for the entire country and ALL THE REST who didn't support him, he basically could have cared less for these people. The president is supposed to be for everyone WHETHER you voted for him or not or whether you like or not TRUMP WAS NOT THIS. Biden will be, this is what I like and am most looking forward to Sherrie.

As well you like others ignore everything Trump and his ppl did prior and is doing now to try and create voter fraud by making sure Biden votes don't count acting like they aren't valid saying they are illegal trying to change the election any way possible by calling senators and representatives and putting pro republican ppl everywhere. Asking for recounts when EVEN after the recount it still shows Biden won in those states. That sounds like Fraud to me, not to mention there were even reports they were taking away mail ballot slots in some places so ya....I will stick with what I originally said Biden tried to prevent fraud from happening Trump is basically doing it out in the open or attempted to do it and ppl are still ignoring this fact and being blind to it. That is BIG TIME! Ppl need to wake up and realize this. Stop following someone blindly without seeing what is going on in front of your eyes what he is doing and the lies/baseless claims he is spreading for his own personal gain he don't care about the American ppl, and seeing no wrong in what the guy is doing and how he is acting right now. No other president would be acting this way and the Republicans would not accept it if it were the other way around.

He also said don't be discouraged to vote by mail which Trump said you shouldn't so he could get more votes in person which is the whole reason he lost, Biden really encouraged the mail in vote and Trump said the opposite and he wonders why he lost lol!!. Its funny how easy ppl can be fooled by not taking into account the whole context of what he is saying. People like to cut bits and pieces out here and there to make it look like he said something else, nice try but once again FAIL. Trump lost and that's it. His main message here is not to be intimidated to VOTE that is the whole point of this lol. He also encouraged ppl who could not get to polls in person to vote by mail. HIS MAIN MSG TO HIS BASE.....VOTE EARLY, which is exactly what they did. Our democracy is at stake, all true words he spoke which Trump and his ppl like to ignore, they take a part of what he said lol and cut out the rest. Learn to comprehend and take the whole of what he is saying into account. Its funny out the whole video that's what you took from it smh lmao.

In case you're wondering, infer means to deduce or conclude (something) from evidence and reasoning rather than from explicit statements. For example from this information we can infer that you can't figure something out unless someone explicitly says something or explains it to you. If you listened to what he said it's obvious that it isn't a voter fraud organisation, I'm pretty sure that you don't talk about making sure your vote counts and that you have 1 000 lawyers in the same paragraph as you commiting a crime.

But we will be taxed to death so he can get his rocks off on his global warming beliefs. You guys, that obviously love him, are probably not as financially strapped as some of the rest of us. It may sound good, in theory, to some but its ridiculously expensive for all of us. He, like the rest of the Democrats, have no issue with taxing the people to death.

Lol 😂😂😂. “Come on, man!!” You either have to be trolling or like I mentioned before, waaay too dumb. Even a 1st grader knows “we” does not mean “they” lol 😂.

What the president is trying to do, is (to) discourage people from voting by implying that they won't be counted, it can't be counted, ... " He's reporting about what information (the press most likely) has collected and put together. He's definitely not saying they, the Democrats, have build such organization. Latest with the next sentence the context must be fully clear. "put together" here means for sure that "we've put the pieces together of what we see/hear/get aware of". All the next sentence explain that peopls shall go for vote and give several hints how this can be done, even they get distracted or discouraged by the above mentioned actions of President Trump.

It just went over the line, because most of our voters are that stupid that they have no idea what is fracking, it's just a bad word, but then some people understood it the word got out, and well to be honest it was unintentional for we to actually know what fracking really is, so it's not Biden's fault but ours.

Trump has DONE A LOT OF SHIT to try and create voter fraud and EVEN RIGHT now with all his lawsuits which are all failing btw and trying to overturn shit in states he clearly lost and putting pro republican ppl everywhere calling senators to stop counting Biden votes and pretty much saying he don't care who voted for Biden just count the Trump votes. You idiots are too blinded to see that though, even Republicans are coming out now and telling him to stop being a pathetic loser and accept the results. YOU PPL wanted all the votes counted and that is what they are doing WHICH STILL SHOW Biden WON regardless how many recounts there are for this idiot.

Its funny how easy ppl can be fooled by not taking into account the whole context of what he is saying. People like to cut bits and pieces out here and there to make it look like he said something else, nice try but once again FAIL. Trump lost and that's it. His main message here is not to be intimidated to VOTE that is the whole point of this lol. He also encouraged ppl who could not get to polls in person to vote by mail. HIS MAIN MSG TO HIS BASE.....VOTE EARLY, which is exactly what they did.

Result: obama: 13, trump: 7 In 2014 there was this really similar case to Floyd, it was the case of Eric Garner who was chokehold to death by a police officer while he said "I can't breathe" 11 times!!! And guess what the cop was only put on desk duty!!! And guess what more that same cop was fired in 2019, ie during Trump! So clearly the riots were used for political benefits of a certain party, why weren't those riots going on against obama he has almost 2 times worse record than trump!? He probably has 2 or more times worse record, cause he was in office 2008-2016, and here we consider 3yrs of obama vs 4yrs of trump... So much propaganda from the campaign with the biggest budget in USA history and the biggest media and hollywood support, ie propaganda... And as far as I've heard the man who said "If you don't vote for me you aren't black!" was actually involved in segregation, he certainly didn't do anything or enough during his 40 years in government to help them... Very shameful... Disgusting...	UCq113ljOL9CyVDpsGKN95hg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq113ljOL9CyVDpsGKN95hg	1	UgwNDqzKeuXn1cusmP94AaABAg	Facts

Yesterday I saw where in Lancaster there was 108,539 mail in ballots requested and had 89,539 returned, BUT there was 142,584 counted!. And people are stupid enough to believe it is a fair and honest election. Both sides should want it to be fair. There should be three rules or laws for voting. 1. You must be a legal U.S. resident. 2. You must vote in person and have an ID to prove you are who you say you are. 3. NO MAIL IN VOTES, except for military persons serving outside the country. When I vote I have to show my DL and sign the ledger which is proper for voting. Veritas exposed on video the vote harvesting scheme in Michigan which also proves that the election should be tossed out. Every election there should be a separate name on the ballot for those that don&#39;t like the choice and that is NONE OF THE ABOVE. Not to mention that when he stated on tv that he held money back until the prosecutor that was investigating Burisma oil was fired, that violated a part of U.S. code 18 . Can&#39;t recall the fine part but that actually bars him from ever holding any kind of public office again. IANAL, but these things like this need to be enforced across the board for every damn politician out there.	UCfNcnw8iseERAU8LkgvipBQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfNcnw8iseERAU8LkgvipBQ	0

AND BIDEN WILL BE IN OFFICE MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT. Trump was a wannabe dictator this whole time so again what is your point?? If it were up to him he would never leave the office and have his family in there for future campaigns/elections. CONTEXT MATTERS bud, as I keep saying WATCHING THE WHOLE VIDEO MATTERS. THE ORGANIZATION Biden is referring to is down below along with the website and phone number. ACTUAL proof unlike the Trump team has now of the alleged mass voter fraud. The PREVENTION organization Biden was talking about is down below. As well if you watched the whole video and not just bits and pieces and random words or sentences at certain times. You would KNOW that he also said he is talking about this so DEMOCRATS know how and where to go to make sure that EVERY single vote they cast COUNTS towards getting him elected. HE WOULD NOT have said that if it is what you are saying. Basically he is reaching out to his base which is clear FROM WATCHING the whole video as I keep saying. Biden and his people made this video known because they were worried TRUMP was trying to FRAUD and steal the election by saying NOT TO VOTE BY MAIL to his supporters as well as having his ppl take away mail ballot slots in different areas to discourage voting that way which Biden encouraged his supporters to vote by mail due to the CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC. SO YA again what he is specifically talking about is down below, sorry buddy you got to do more research next time and don't just jump to conclusions before knowing all the facts and details first, just a word of advice for you. Can't wait Biden and Kamala in the White House soon January 2021, 80 million plus people are looking forward to that and to put this Trump experiment which failed immensely behind them. What he's talking about is right here: The hotline first. You can even call their number 1-833-DEM-VOTE (1-833-336-8683) Also this is the website he is directly telling his supporters to go to if they had any questions or issues regarding their vote or the voting process. https://democrats.org/where-we-stand/the-issues/vote/ You are welcome for the PROOF and INFO above of the (CONTEXT) Biden was talking about. Thank You.	UCqKXnBKnVKHqKAjVGpInA7Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqKXnBKnVKHqKAjVGpInA7Q	1	Ugx97OU0HYoSmxE0QF94AaABAg	JoneSings

He said word for word what people interpreted. In the end if he does go into office people will continue to misinterpret hin for the next four years.

Look at his last four years and some of the things he has said not to mention things he has done in his past too. Use your own brain and do some research I'm not here to do that for you. Ok fair enough, once it gets to the Supreme Court and IT STILL don't change shit I will come back to this comment and talk to you how about that??? And you can do the same if Trump ends up winning but HE WON'T he don't have enough votes he lost by more than 6 million, it is what it is man. Judges are throwing out his claims cuz they aren't based on anything just bunch of ppl coming up with lies and theories that can't prove shit. No actual evidence of anything concrete. Also misinformed about the mail in ballot process which PPL are allowed to vote early that way. It isn't everyone else's fault Trump did not understand that and told his base JUST COME OUT IN PERSON during a world wide pandemic. Biden ppl at least gave a shit about others enough to vote by mail to avoid crowds and not attend super spreader rallies, do you see the virus case numbers and deaths right now??? Thanks to Trump and his failure to address this situation sooner when he had a chance to make a difference then. Again you miss the context of BIDEN talking about the voter fraud organization to prevent against fraud because you didn't watch the whole video as usual with ppl like you, only taking bits and pieces of things to try and make a point where there is none. Trump right now is attempting to do fraud/steal an election by blocking Biden's team from getting information and trying to reverse shit in his favor when it clearly shows Biden won in those places, wanting to put pro republican ppl everywhere and discounting Biden votes by trying to get them tossed even though they were legal and he told HIS PPL to take away mail ballot slots prior to discourage voting that way, so ya you ppl ignore all that though like its okay for a president to act this way, give me a break I will be glad when the Trump freak show in the White House is done with. And you think Trump is an "HONEST" politician lmao!!!He doesn't lie??? Hold on a sec hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaa oh wait hahahahhhahahahahahahaha, okay I'm good that was a good one thanks for the laugh I needed that. Btw this is the democratic organization down below here, pretty much to MAKE SURE YOUR VOTE counted for democratic voters, this is what Biden was talking about. What he's talking about is right here: https://democrats.org/where-we-stand/the-issues/vote/ You can even call their number 1-833-DEM-VOTE (1-833-336-8683) Context matters bud!!!. Stop trying to ignore shit and go around facts changing what was said to suit you because your buddy Trump lost and now you guys are just reaching for anything to try and say it was rigged, making up shit. Give it up! and tell your orange buddy in the White House to give it up too he isn't going to accomplish anything he will be booted outta there by force if necessary come January 2021 because Biden already stated he WILL kick him out if he doesn't have enough sense to leave on his own, which it don't look like he has any sense, the WHITE HOUSE WON'T BE HIS PLAYGROUND ANYMORE, did he think it would be his house forever??. He can step aside and let A REAL PRESIDENT step in to deal with the country and its serious issues, this ain't a joke of a job its to be taken seriously and to Trump it was a joke and not taken seriously as evidence now by him playing golf every other day while the country suffers through a pandemic crisis, you think he cares about the ppl. LMAO!! ya okay nuff said ppl are tired of his bullshit that's just what it is sorry man and the 80 million or so votes Biden got most in history btw for a president elect reflects that quite clearly.

All the judges throwing the cases out are liberals. The Supreme court will decide the final outcome. Biden saud "voter fraud" and "policing". These are not terms an honest politician uses. He was not afraid to say it because he knew what was planned.	UCoiIIRYrMg6tGENtMmX217A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoiIIRYrMg6tGENtMmX217A	1	Ugx97OU0HYoSmxE0QF94AaABAg	JoneSings

Also even if there was, you can't seriously believe the fraud is enough to turn back the election results which show Biden has won in the electoral vote by ALOT as Trump likes to say its not even close and he won Arizona today too. Also Biden has 5 million more popular votes lets be realistic here, those ARE NOT all fraud and Trump just does not have enough votes meaning he DID NOT win he may pick up some votes here and there or even take away some from Biden but its won't be enough Biden won and that what everything is showing. As for the racism there are plenty of examples of Trump being racist online I don't need to provide examples here do your due diligence and research that for yourself its documented. If the election results are reversed and that's a BIG IF I'm not going to do anything lol I will accept it unlike what Trump and his ppl are doing now. I can't speak for what others will do but I will accept it because what is fair is fair, if Biden won fairly then Trump and his ppl should accept that too but I have feeling they won't even if there is NO DOUBT Biden won. Now I don't expect any of this to happen I expect Trump to be gone by February and the Biden/Harris team there to take over mind you. Btw they are throwing out Trump lawsuits from his team like almost everywhere so I don't really expect too much to change he can't prove that he is without a doubt a winner over Biden, there is just not enough to support that but there is plenty of evidence/votes to show Biden won its just a portion of the population and country are having a hard time coming to terms with it because they really thought "their guy" was not gonna lose, but it takes time for the shock to wear off and they will come around eventually as others have said from what I believe. Hope my answer satisfies you.	UCqKXnBKnVKHqKAjVGpInA7Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqKXnBKnVKHqKAjVGpInA7Q	1	Ugx97OU0HYoSmxE0QF94AaABAg	JoneSings

Also speaks to the fact how many ppl got tired of Trumps shit. Trump better get his shit outta there soon the white house that is or he will be forcibly removed by team Biden time is running out for him. If you didn't get what I said from how I explained it there is no helping you sorry. Republicans need to take the blinders off Trump is a loser and he was never a good president for all only for his base, Biden will be for all whether you like him or not or whether you voted for him or not Trump was not that what so ever.

Why would he ever want to overwhelm the system right after claiming he has the most extensive fraud system ever? Couple that with how hard the media is shutting down any questions about where all these ballots came from, add to that Republican poll watchers not being allowed to to observe, add to that an indictment and convict toon of two Philly big wigs of voter fraud just this year, f’d to that the statistical anomalies that are absolutely insane. You really want us to believe an old racist white guy got 10million more votes than the first Black President?

He also said don't be discouraged to vote by mail which Trump said you shouldn't so he could get more votes in person which is the whole reason he lost, Biden really encouraged the mail in vote and Trump said the opposite and he wonders why he lost lol!!. Its funny how easy ppl can be fooled by not taking into account the whole context of what he is saying. People like to cut bits and pieces out here and there to make it look like he said something else, nice try but once again FAIL. Trump lost and that's it. His main message here is not to be intimidated to VOTE that is the whole point of this lol. He also encouraged ppl who could not get to polls in person to vote by mail. HIS MAIN MSG TO HIS BASE.....VOTE EARLY, which is exactly what they did. Our democracy is at stake, all true words he spoke which Trump and his ppl like to ignore, they take a part of what he said lol and cut out the rest. Learn to comprehend and take the whole of what he is saying into account. Its funny out the whole video that's what you took from it smh lmao.

In case you're wondering, infer means to deduce or conclude (something) from evidence and reasoning rather than from explicit statements. For example from this information we can infer that you can't figure something out unless someone explicitly says something or explains it to you.

I’m for the moon and Mars because everything else is going as quickly as it can including the virus that is nearly equivalent to the flu! This man is ill and needs to rest , I honestly fear him being near the black box that holds the nuke switch and it’s probably not just a single button and if we needed it I have doubts he could do it in a timely fashion... their are people that can’t wait for Biden to get in office because they know something is wrong, and it’s sad the democrats would push him into office knowing he is sick and I would like to know why because he really is not popular and go ahead and argue that fact then compare his social media to others like Trump..... something is wrong with this ordeal and I would suggest people think about wether or not our country would survive with him in office, love the climate but we don’t need him in office to do anything.

They spent three years trying to find some evidence that Trump was a Russian asset with no success. "You" hated Trump for allegedly embracing Russia instead of America, but in the face of indisputable evidence that Biden and family sold out America to the Chinese government, you embrace him and rejoice that he could be President. Anyone like this is a feckless hypocrite and is not worthy to be called an American. Packing bags is what people like this should be doing instead of Trump.

There is a TON of info about Biden’s son. <br />In just this interview, Biden can’t even make coherent sentences. He said he is “running as Donald Trump.” <br />It’s a joke to hear the rhetoric about climate change! He uses forests burning as an example, hurricanes, etc &amp; most know it takes management of forests (which you can discover yourself). Look up (like I did) why they push climate change so much. It gets funded by at least $42 billion per year! Believing this dude cares about you more than you, is naive. America is the cleanest in the world when it comes to the environment! We should be good stewards of the planet, but not to the level he’s talking about! It’s easy $ for the politicians!

Plus the New Green Deal will cost $50-93 trillion, an estimated cost of $600,000 per house hold according to Wikipedia. The US is gonna be so indebt.

To me Biden shows that he can lead this country very well, he's smart and compassionate. He cares for this country and other countries in the world, but most importantly he cares for the people. He believes in climate change and wants to help stop it. He actually seems like he wants to do something about the racism in this country and help every race and gender be successful. I have not seen or herd anything about trump wanting to do anything "for the people", I mean what the hell did he do when we were having riots because of police brutality? Nothing. Yeah he has brought down unemployment and helped the economy but the truth is that both of those were already really good because of Obama, so to be honest why can't we say Biden will do the same? At this point I just want a president that cares for the human race and not just "America" I'm tired of trump and his supporters saying make America great again when really it was already great before him. It's time we have someone that can lead us to be friends with other countries not enemies, I know we are a very strong country but I want to be a strong country with the help of the world not just ourselves	UCKh20bKo3rJDyeMN3pd7AAg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKh20bKo3rJDyeMN3pd7AAg	1	UgxY7xed5PucnXhRo2h4AaABAg	Violet Bynog

He is considered abusive because he is not taking any crap from career politicians that have done nothing but keep switching agendas every 2 years. So the career politicians had a plan to make everyone that is weak minded hate the current president, despite all his milestones. so that whoever they put against him could win. So, all that voted for Biden did so because they were told to. And you voted for a crooked, lying traitor just to get rid of someone who is doing the best job ever. Just watch how bad the economy gets, how much worse the COVID outbreaks will get, and he will take credit for the vaccines that are already being made because of President Trump. Remember the Democratic debates where Kamala called Biden a racist? Do you remember how well the democratic governors on the West Coast protected their citizens and their businesses from the Antifa riots? They didn't. Trump won 90% of the counties in most states, but lost the election?

It's hard to tell that you know what an inference is based on you all ignoring half the information. For example, talking about making sure your vote counts and that you have 1 000 lawyers in the same paragraph as supposedly commiting vote fraud doesn't really make sense. I will admit I'm not American so I don't know what you all do over in your country but over here in Australia we don't really talk about commiting crimes and then talk about making sure that when you do the thing legally it counts. The main reason is probably that most people have common sense but again, not American so I wouldn't know.

In case you're wondering, infer means to deduce or conclude (something) from evidence and reasoning rather than from explicit statements. For example from this information we can infer that you can't figure something out unless someone explicitly says something or explains it to you. If you listened to what he said it's obvious that it isn't a voter fraud organisation, I'm pretty sure that you don't talk about making sure your vote counts and that you have 1 000 lawyers in the same paragraph as you commiting a crime about voting.

Why would Biden say this and then tell people to call the "Dem voting number, with lawyers handy to help protect their rights to VOTE?" The only time Trump had a hotline was for people to report and produce fake voter fraud claims. For which ended up shutting down. Even one of his Texan cronie offered to pay anybody $1million for a legit lead. Since Trump believed the system was so unreliable, why didn't he have the same thing in place like "sleepy Joe ahead of the election?" Joe may not have worded it perfect, but it was clear what he meant at the end. Trump and his cronies tried to suppress votes thinking his supporters and big rallies would turn up at the polls during a pandemic. Well, more people voted early and stayed at home safely voting by mail. Then there were sone determined to make sure their votes got there and stood in the long lines. Considering Texas tried to make it inconvenient too. I guess he's not so sleepy after all! The "extensive voter fraud" was Trump putting doubt in our democracy of voting! Just like he did the virus.

If you were able to track your vote, you could see that it was received and submitted. If not you could go direct to the election office and have them check for you in person, verify your id and submit a provisional ballot before election day. Trump's sabotage to use the post office to disenfranchise voters who used absentee ballot methods to vote worked against him because people decided to wait hours in early voting lines, like myself, and vote in person. When I tracked my vote it was counted as an absentee vote on the day I voted. So all those millions of votes where people stood in line where considered absentee votes. That's where those high numbers came from.	UCJ6YdnYib7oaI0ThqQwX6iw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ6YdnYib7oaI0ThqQwX6iw	1	UgxueEsUOExKqbz1m5J4AaABAg	Sean McSharry

He also said don't be discouraged to vote by mail which Trump said you shouldn't so he could get more votes in person which is the whole reason he lost, Biden really encouraged the mail in vote and Trump said the opposite and he wonders why he lost lol!!. Its funny how easy ppl can be fooled by not taking into account the whole context of what he is saying. People like to cut bits and pieces out here and there to make it look like he said something else, nice try but once again FAIL. Trump lost and that's it. His main message here is not to be intimidated to VOTE that is the whole point of this lol. He also encouraged ppl who could not get to polls in person to vote by mail. HIS MAIN MSG TO HIS BASE.....VOTE EARLY, which is exactly what they did. Our democracy is at stake, all true words he spoke which Trump and his ppl like to ignore, they take a part of what he said lol and cut out the rest.

Trump has demonstrated that he is willing to play dirty to try and manipulate the election so the organisation he was speaking of is to counter Trumps tactics. If he was talking about a plot to defraud the election why would he describe it as inclusive? why would he blurt it out on a public podcast 2 weeks before the election?

You say he has failed while he turned 1 million dollars to 6 billion. If that's failed to you then the only people you believe to be succesful are Mark Zuckerberg , Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates. Yes his net worth has actually been cut in half since he became president and yes his net worth was falling before that. But somebody who takes advantage of his place of power in government usually doesn't lose money since the allegation is that he is stealing money to enrich himself. But I guess logic isn't common to you Trump haters. You wanna know the facts? He donates every single penny of his salary back to the government and he has not enriched himself through government ,not even the slightest . But I guess people like you are ok with Clinton Foundation getting millions from foreign countries under Obama.

I got to vote for the first time this year, and I voted for the guy who is doing what I want for the country. Trump has done so many things as president that I wanted, and kept his campaign promises; something that can't be said for most recent presidents. His actions show that he _does_ have the best interest of the US at heart. Have you ever even listened to him over the last few decades? He's been very consistent on his views on the country and on policy. I never said you should concede to me. I just want to, hopefully, help anybody reading this to question the narrative and take a look at _everything_ that has been presented by the investigators. There's a lot more than "He had contact with these Russian officials!" Without even knowing why.

Meaning the person heard or saw something and made assumptions about what they heard or seen. Second, there was plenty of evidence that the Trump campaign had multiple contact with Russians. Some contacts were under the guise of getting dirt on his political opponent and Manafort sharing polling data with Russian sympathizers in Ukraine. I don't ignore either side. I read and search for truth. So far, there is no credible evidence of mass voter fraud and why the courts keep dismissing cases. And you contradict yourself again, in regards to the polling data. It was correct, as well see from the outcome of the election. Biden has 6 million more popular votes and 306 popular votes. But of course, those who are sore losers and poor sports, will claim it was rigged, there was fraud, and the opponents cheated.

Second, they aren't showing the big evidence yet; you NEVER show your hand before you play it. And third, the polls are wrong; they were wrong last election, and they weren't any better this time. If you can't see the evidence that's already available to the public, you're blind. They have sworn witness statements saying they watched ballots get scanned multiple times, others trashed and not counted, the list goes on. There wasn't a single shred of evidence that Trump colluded with Russia, yet the fake news media were all over it. It doesn't take evidence for them; they only have a narrative to push, and hoped to find dirt. So the fact that they aren't reporting on this when there is already so much material that is recognized in court as evidence points to something fishy.

The fact that you think opinion show hosts on Fox, are actual journalists, shows you don't have the slightest concept of verifiable and credible reporting. The reason msm isn't covering this is because they are unfounded claims, propped up by affidavits from witnesses with hearsay and conjecture. I'm all for investigations. There has to be credible evidence for it to get to courts. The evidence shown for supposed mass election fraud, is bogus. Trump's lawyers aren't even claiming fraud when they present their cases in front of judges... Some of these judges were appointed by Trump. Also, all yourself this: Why would the candidate, leading in almost every poll and showing to be the favorite to win, would risk that outcome, by trying to rig the election, they are favored to win?

You aren't a journalist if you aren't trying to get to the bottom of a claim as serious as massive voter fraud. They (MSM) were all over it four years ago, and now it's silence from them on the matter, except for those few shows on Fox. Fox has shifted way to the left, and you're delusional if you think otherwise. I don't watch Fox at all unless it's one of those shows, which are doing the journalists' job for them at this point, when it comes to this very important issue.

They don't even consider the very serious claims that voter fraud is taking place, but brush it off as "baseless" just like CNN. So I now put them in the same group of fake news. Don't get me wrong, there are a bunch of people with Fox who have great shows, but Fox News itself is getting worse. Especially after that disaster debate moderation by Chris Wallace, who only wanted to interrogate Trump, and get him to denounce "white supremacy," which he's already done before, and gave Biden all soft balls.

You do not know your American history by the early 1800 as the Electoral Collage became all or nothing rather than individuals casting for the majority vote in their district the framers begin to become disillusion with what had become of what they created. In the 1970's it was almost done away with and even Nixon supported the move. Instead the electoral college is being used to try and impose mob rule by Trump and his supports.

As I see it, republicans have a history of trying to suppress votes in places where most voters are likely to vote for the democrats. https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/01/the-gop-just-received-another-tool-for-suppressing-votes/550052 There is always a lot of talk about voter fraud, not just this year. Trump is fuelling the whole conspirasy theory with baseless claims, and the funny thing is that people believe him and just keep regurgitating his claims without examining them. However, there are people that actually do look into claims of voter fraud and you can find many studies that clearly debunks all the baseless claims from republicans. https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/analysis/Briefing_Memo_Debunking_Voter_Fraud_Myth.pdf	UCiILdnlB2l-h0oCdejufYxQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiILdnlB2l-h0oCdejufYxQ	1	UgyohO7Idu-eqVOhIDp4AaABAg	Melody Dawn

That's why all states are denying his lawsuits even the ones that are on his side.

America doesn’t have to run it’s healthcare system like every other country. If you don’t like it.. then move somewhere that represents your views. You may have been born here ..but clearly America doesn’t suit you if you’re calling it a ‘shithole’ for not giving you ‘free shit.’ GET OUT!! Besides, the real issue is the mandate requiring years of irrelevant college at an inflated cost to become a doctor. With today’s technology, there is absolutely no reason a general practitioner needs to get an expensive 10 year college degree (writing English essays, and doing trigonometry) ..simply to diagnose that your sick, and prescribe antibiotics. This is why healthcare is so outrageous. Out-of-date education mandates are root of the problem, which colleges take full financial advantage of. Ask a doctor how much of his college education is actually relevant to the practice. Aside from ‘credentials,’ not much.

That is something you have not come to terms with yet, everyone and their mother is telling Trump to concede lets see how long he can keep this up. Slowly slowly he is losing support from his own people so I would say sometime in the near future, I heard he already knows he lost but is just playing up to his base as he normally does to make it seem like he is fighting for them but you know what can you do. I'm just happy the orange dude is gone soon I have had enough of him quite frankly and 77 million plus ppl have as well.

I don't care to indulge you is pretty much what I said maybe that flew over your head we obviously won't agree. What is SIMPLE is that Biden got 5 million more votes than Trump and won the electoral college as well LEGALLY and he is going to be the next president that is simple enough to understand. Also Trump has a couple months to get his affairs in order and his shit out of the white house that is all that matters now for him. Biden has to go in there and fix his mess starting with the virus that Trump and his team totally fucked up on. Can't wait for Biden and Kamala to be in there. Trump has to worry about lawsuits coming his way now and being forcibly removed from the white house that is NOT HIS anymore after January 2021 although he likes to act like its his house forever having the kind of parties he does you would think its a frat house there. Anyways I'm just happy Biden is in now and 77 plus American ppl feel that way as well. Trump will be okay he can still have his rallies its just now he won't be president and no one will give a shit about it or cover it like they do now thank god lol. About time he really got annoying with his antics.	UCqKXnBKnVKHqKAjVGpInA7Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqKXnBKnVKHqKAjVGpInA7Q	1	UgyohO7Idu-eqVOhIDp4AaABAg	Melody Dawn

Its funny how easy ppl can be fooled by not taking into account the whole context of what he is saying. People like to cut bits and pieces out here and there to make it look like he said something else, nice try but once again FAIL. Trump lost and that's it. His main message here is not to be intimidated to VOTE that is the whole point of this lol. He also encouraged ppl who could not get to polls in person to vote by mail. HIS MAIN MSG TO HIS BASE.....VOTE EARLY, which is exactly what they did. Our democracy is at stake, all true words he spoke which Trump and his ppl like to ignore, they take a part of what he said lol and cut out the rest.

We already get hit with a lot of taxes we dont want anymore. Paying for healthcare will always be the best way for treatment because hospitals will get packed due to our population and it would simply cost too much as a country to supply everyone with healthcare. That means supplying for people that aren’t contributing into the system. It would discourage competition with insurance companies which will 1.) cost working people of insurance companies jobs. 2.) doctors would be in high demand lowering the income of doctors and not all doctors have the same amount of knowledge and skill so it would level out salaries between two doctors that are on two different levels in terms of skill. The better doctor should get paid.	UCip7Q3iDiCEFL117IXk9fqQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCip7Q3iDiCEFL117IXk9fqQ	1	UgyohO7Idu-eqVOhIDp4AaABAg	Melody Dawn

THEN we pay another 13% on almost everything we buy. If you can afford an accountant.. hint(higher incomes).. you can basically pay less than 15%. That's how Bernie/Trump pay so little.. nothing is in their direct names(their businesses are incorporated) & they pay themselves a salary to keep taxes down. Then claim everything from a suit to gas as expenses.. thereby lowering the amount of taxes they pay on their personal income. You guys need to educate yourself on the truth. Not false media. We have the same propaganda here. I can tell you some doozies as I've been working & living in hospitals for 30yrs(high medical daughter). It takes 6 months to see a psychiatrist(& that is for 1/2 appts to prescribe meds), up to a year for surgeries, many things are pay for use. I hate hearing how medical decisions are decided by insurance companies there - that NEEDS TO CHANGE. We have hallway medicine.. people laying on stretchers in halls..FOR DAYS. I experienced this w my mom & hundreds of other people. All you have to do is look up Canadian news on it. My mum died because of lack of care, in hospital. She had a stroke & they didn't feed her(couldn't feed herself), didn't change here - left in soiled diapers for hours after being told, didn't do regular turning of her(its law every 2 hours) & she ended up with a life ending wound on her back.. she died a horrible, painful death. Bc THERE'S NOT ENOUGH STAFF - AKA Funding. Same thing w our atrocious elderly homes.

So, yes he was impeached but acquitted "free (someone) from a criminal charge by a verdict of not guilty" nonetheless. Plus that doesn't prove anything. It was the house that pulled the impeachment, which was democrat lead. Him being acquitted means that he is innocent. Still proving that statement invalid. Democrats had the majority and it would've gone through to the senate regardless. I wonder why it didn't pass in the senate?

For soliciting ukraine to investigate joe biden. But the only reason why he's still in office is because he was acquitted of all charges but even tho he wasn't removed he still was impeached. And trump is the one starting the riots it's not just antifa rioting trump supporters are doing it to and is he out there telling them not to nope he's more worried about how he's going to spin this false voter fraud accusation to everyone. He's a liar and a manipulator who never deserved to hold the office. So you should start fact checking actually fact checking before you say something. Yes he had trial for his crimes and yes he was acquitted but he was still impeached you can be impeached and still hold office.

If they found anything Pence would be president right now. Edit: It was pointed out to me that I was wrong and impeachment is the process not outcome*. Above statement of he was not impeached is invalid... 2.) Trump is trying to halt the counting of late ballots that are being counted after Election Day (where all the anomalies started). That is not voter fraud because theoretically everyone who voted, already voted. So he is not suppressing or committing voter fraud (adding or subtracting votes). It also makes strategical sense on a country basis too. Antifa is already rioting because they hate Biden and if a winner is announced before they prove fraud (if Biden wins), cities will burn. This is a strategy to stall so the country doesn’t go to crap before someone takes over. Especially if Trump proves that voter fraud actually took place. He doesn’t want the next four years to be to rebuild again... Just a thought... Edit: Just so we’re on the same page, having an impeachment hearing and getting impeached are two separate verbs with different definitions. Just because there was a hearing does not mean he was guilty (which we all know is he was innocent of all crimes alleged).

The healthcare system in the USA is one of the best on the planet. Is it perfect? No. Could we improve it, yes. But turning to socialized medicine is not the answer. That’s the exact opposite of the answer.	UCoe28kBpnuagmJeE5rZhuVA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoe28kBpnuagmJeE5rZhuVA	1	UgyohO7Idu-eqVOhIDp4AaABAg	Melody Dawn

What you talk about sounds great and I mean this with the most respect towards you, but they create these institutions to make us reliant on them to destroy freedom and make themselves more powerful and rich. Obamacare was a disaster here. The premiums just kept going up and up until I could have paid for 10 insurance plans privately. They say one thing and always do another. We have incredibly corrupt government and that won’t stop because of a vote. We must remove them and re-instate the original constitution as it says, or we will be destroyed and enslaved. Do you think what they have done to you in Australia is ok with the lockdowns and worse police brutality than we have here to wear a muzzle? Please just try and understand my point of view, because I have taken what you said and really thought about it. They disarmed your country and now they do what they dammed well please because they have no fear of you anymore as a people. You have been made surfs in a country with so much potential. I pray for you as a person, you as a nation, and everyone altogether as human beings to stop being lied to and read old books to find the truth. I know you will probably come back with some remark to this or ignore me but I just want you to know that I wouldn’t have spent my time typing this if I didn’t care. We all think we are right and everyone else is wrong. I’m not perfect either. Everyday I learn more and more and find out I was fooled to the fullest extent my entire life. All I challenge you to do is go on the journey for information. I admit I could be wrong. But from what I have seen from thousands of hours of hours of research and thousands of books that I have collected over my life, is that there is sinister people planning horrible things for us all and I see everyone that is threatened by it as a brother and sister. God bless you, even if you don’t care about what I wrote, don’t read it, or just completely disagree. I love you as a fellow human and wanted to give my opinion and tell you my knowledge of things from 30 years of research.

The ones who feel the sales tax the most are the poor. PR has a sales tax of 10% and it is already highly difficult for people to live there. They flee. To the mainland. If you think it is expensive to live in Irvine, Cali that is what you will get. Sweden does not have federal minimum wage. This and other deregulation aids locals on opening businesses. We don't have that. While I agree that healthcare needs to be fixed and that some amount of free healthcare can be achieved, a sudden shift will hit the most vulnerable. And then we'll remember those class issues that have been overshadowed by identity politics. And sending troops out there like Biden and Obama did will not send that money to healthcare.

He also said don't be discouraged to vote by mail which Trump said you shouldn't so he could get more votes in person which is the whole reason he lost, Biden really encouraged the mail in vote and Trump said the opposite and he wonders why he lost lol!!. Its funny how easy ppl can be fooled by not taking into account the whole context of what he is saying. People like to cut bits and pieces out here and there to make it look like he said something else, nice try but once again FAIL. Trump lost and that's it. His main message here is not to be intimidated to VOTE that is the whole point of this lol. He also encouraged ppl who could not get to polls in person to vote by mail. HIS MAIN MSG TO HIS BASE.....VOTE EARLY, which is exactly what they did. Our democracy is at stake, all true words he spoke which Trump and his ppl like to ignore, they take a part of what he said lol and cut out the rest. Learn to comprehend and take the whole of what he is saying into account. Its funny out the whole video that's what you took from it smh lmao.

If that were truly the case, your vote alone would have won the vote for him. It takes all of us to vote. We are not all going to vote for the same person. Your anger and hatred for Trump and anyone that votes for him is part of the reason there is so much division. As adults, we should either agree to disagree or not comment. I am an adult, I don't need to hurl insults at perfect strangers to get my point across. I have been voting since 1978. I'm used to seeing the opposition from both sides. But there had never been an election like this one in history. I have never seen so much anger and hatred just because someone sees things and thinks differently than you do. If everyone thought the same, there would be no need for an election. I find your attitude and insults appalling and immature! Didn't your mother teach you that if you have nothing nice to say, to say nothing at all? This is a discussion, not a boxing ring! Everyone is entitled to their own opinion.

If you had an illness and you were not going to die from the illness alone but then you got Covid and then died, Covid killed you. Why do you think scientists are saying that people with underlying health conditions are most at risk? I'm going to need some sources for the claims that your making especially for " if you are living in the same home as someone with covid chances are you'll never get it." The fact that you believe the virus is manufactured tells me I dealing with someone who doesn't use actual facts to support their claims but conspiracy theories. Do you also believe that the MMR vaccine causes autism or that the Earth is Flat? Why on earth would business people create a fake crisis that would lead to them losing profits? Not to mention also have the power to somehow convince international scientists and countries to go along with a fake crisis that they wouldn't benefit from. People not following covid guidelines is a problem in general. It has nothing to do with political affiliation. There is nothing wrong with going out to eat or get a hair cut as long as safety guidelines are being followed. Keeping everything open during the height of a pandemic is a terrible idea especially with safety guidelines not being followed. That is the reason people say Trump handled things poorly because he wanted people to open up with no guidelines or open up when they were experiencing high cases. Medicine exists to bypass natural selection. By your logic there is no point of medicine. Let's just let natural selection do its work, right? Let's just let people die all willy-nilly even though it's possible to prevent it. BTW if your child gets seriously ill are you just going to let them die and let natural selection do its work or are you going to do all you can to stop a preventable death like a sane person? I will need a credible source for that claim about someone being born immune to the virus. That is not a solution because that doesn't help people who don't happen to have an immunity to a covid due to a benefitial mutation that they have had since birth.

At least not from them..... Strange huh? Let's put things into perspective. For real this time. First wave: ample testing. So few infections, those who end up in the hospital are registered cuz you know hospital and stuf. Second wave: more testing, who knew more infections.... Even my fucking child can tell you somethings off. And he's 4. Third wave:even more testing. Who knew more infections.... But deaths by covid drop. Also how many people only died of covid. And had no other illness or injury. I think the number wol be very low. The crisis is manufactured. And you idiots are walking right into it. Have fun in the new technocratie. Cuz that's what they are doing transferring wealth. Destroying small and medium size businesses. So only the big boys are left. And let's not forget about democrats not upholding they're own rules. Like going to have a hair cut. Or just going out to eat. Or my favorite having a party. Also if you try to pin that on Trump 2. He is the one saying let's keep everything open as much as possible. Covid Wil probably never go away. Although I hear d a baby that was immune was born. Funny how nature gives us a solution yet you goddamm morons refuse to understand evolution.

Some people didn't want to take that chance since the may be vulnerable or have loved one that are vulnerable to the virus. You do realize the initial lockdowns helped decrease the initial spread of the virus and had more than 50% of the country also followed through with the lockdown and continued implementing procedures that would decrease the spread of the virus like wearing a mask, we would be in a better place right now. For example, we wouldn't be seeing cases higher than what they were when we barely knew anything about the virus. You are acting like the entire world didn't go into a lockdown. Every country did the lockdown. The lockdown was beneficial. It just didn't work as well because people didn't follow basic instructions. Had people done what they were supposed to do, businesses and workplaces would have opened up earlier. You also can't keep the country open at the expense of other people's lives. You can always strengthen the economy. You can't bring people back from the dead. Keeping the country open when there is a harmful disease going around with no vaccine would have led to: more death, higher spread and a more forceful lockdown. It's also really disgusting how you don't take it seriously. People have died from this virus. 200,000+ people is still a lot even though it's a small percentage of the population and hospitals are struggling to treat all these covid patients and regular patients at the same time.

You can even call their number 1-833-DEM-VOTE (1-833-336-8683) Also this is the website he is directly telling his supporters to go to if they had any questions or issues regarding their vote or the voting process. https://democrats.org/where-we-stand/the-issues/vote/ As well as this website below has also been referred to if people needed more assistance with getting their vote counted and information on HOW to actually vote. Also talks about important information regarding Covid-19. However, unlike the other two I linked this website is not specifically for Democrats or for people who voted for Biden, anyone could have used it but mentioning it is helpful to people who needed assistance with voting and other inquiries and did not know where else to turn. This website right here. https://www.eac.gov/ Anyways THAT is what Biden was talking about in this video, hope I answered your question. People do not understand what context is and like I said were jumping to conclusions because they did not understand what message Biden was trying to get across to his base. Which again was to VOTE EARLY and that they DON'T have to worry about fraud and their vote NOT COUNTING if they call the number I listed and go to those websites to help them with everything. Anyways I can't really make it much more clear than that lol. All I can say is context matters its important lol and understanding the WHOLE VIDEO FULLY, not just watching bits and looking for clips and pieces of sentences to help Trump anyway they can make his case when it isn't what these people think it is. Most of these people I bet you never even bothered to do some research of their own on what he was actually talking about LOL!!. They just took a sentence or some words of what he said and are now acting like LOOK!!! you see lol he just admitted it there has to be fraud going on, he just said it!! lol. I would say hold on a second breathe, take the time to do some research educate yourself on what really is going on and what he was conveying to his supporters. Take the Trump glasses off for a second is what I would say to all those people who are stating the opposite of what I'm saying here lol. It might make you see things a bit more clearly if anything, and allow you not to overreact without knowing all the details first.

Dems were worried Trump was trying to fraud this election and their vote, this is why he felt compelled to make this video. There is even a hotline and website for the organization he is talking about. People like to jump to conclusions without understanding and doing some research of their own because they want Trumpy so bad they will say anything to make him look good lol. This is what happens when you only watch bits and pieces of the video. You hear what you want to for some of these people. Watching the whole video helps to understand the message he was trying to get across to his voters which was to vote, vote and vote early and that your vote will be counted so don't worry about that and HERE is where you can make sure it is counted lol. This is literally what is being said lol.	UCqKXnBKnVKHqKAjVGpInA7Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqKXnBKnVKHqKAjVGpInA7Q	1	Ugzs3ergW04wLmqSKg94AaABAg	Alison Louise

He's an awful president, but his voters aren't smart. https://observers.france24.com/en/20201028-joe-biden-voter-fraud-video-debunked |||On October 24, Pod Save America published a 26-minute interview with Joe Biden. At 17:49, podcast host Dan Pfeiffer asks Biden what his message is to people who are yet to vote, as well as those who have already voted. Biden responds by telling people to make a plan to vote if they haven’t yet, due to the prevalence of voter suppression.||| |||“The Republicans are doing everything they can to make it harder for people to vote – particularly people of colour – to vote,” Biden says. At 19:12, we can hear Biden’s now-viral statement about “the most extensive and inclusive voter fraud organisation”, set up during the Obama administration. However, the statement is followed by a reassurance that Democrats will ensure a fair election despite President Trump’s ongoing allegations of electoral fraud.||| |||It becomes clear, when his answer is heard in its entirety, that Biden is referring to an organisation that counters voter fraud when he says “voter fraud organisation”. The organisation he refers to is the Civic Engagement and Voter Protection team of the Democratic National Committee.||| That quote was taken from this video, and it's obvious that is was clipped from the full interview to be taken out of context.

He also said don't be discouraged to vote by mail which Trump said you shouldn't so he could get more votes in person which is the whole reason he lost, Biden really encouraged the mail in vote and Trump said the opposite and he wonders why he lost lol!!. Its funny how easy ppl can be fooled by not taking into account the whole context of what he is saying. People like to cut bits and pieces out here and there to make it look like he said something else, nice try but once again FAIL. Trump lost and that's it. His main message here is not to be intimidated to VOTE that is the whole point of this lol. He also encouraged ppl who could not get to polls in person to vote by mail. HIS MAIN MSG TO HIS BASE.....VOTE EARLY, which is exactly what they did.

This is most evident with what he continues to say afterward: "what the president is trying to do is discourage people from voting by implying your vote won't be counted...It will be challenged ... if you have any problems call DEMVOTE." Then he says hell connect them to a lawyer if their vote is challenged. (This would be voter fraud since votes would be unlawfully challenged). I can see why people took it the other way but your interpretation doesn't make sense when you take into account what Biden said afterward. He should have said prevention to avoid a misunderstanding. This is the context people are referring to.	UCHdWFsnEdzrwQysaWYhJRhw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHdWFsnEdzrwQysaWYhJRhw	1	Ugzs3ergW04wLmqSKg94AaABAg	Alison Louise

Done everything to try to discourage you, saying he’s not sure he’ll accept the results. He’s not sure what he’ll do. I guarantee you, he’ll accept the results and he’ll be out in..." Trump is not accepting the results, and Biden did not guarantee it. Thanks for helping keep Joe Biden accountable.

It's a metaphysical rule. Biden admits to committing voter fraud! People are already so used to him talking demented nonsense that such a statement is reflexively put into that category, but one has to review each case individually. In this case, he speaks particularly carefully and concentrated and does not correct himself. That was not a slip-up like others, that was meant exactly as he said it. They are dark occultists, they have to publicly reveal what they are doing to avoid the karmic back-lash of their frauds. They are stealing the election and they are admitting it!

Since PA SC ruled that mail-in ballots can be allowed to be received up to 3 days after the election, in violation of PA Constitution as is mail-in voting itself a violation, all those ballots will be tossed out by SCOTUS. Since other states also did it in violation of their states Constitutions too, they will have to follow suit and toss those ballots also. You see, the problem with using covid and rushing the process through was that all the states missed a very important step. They had to amend their state's Constitutions in order to allow it. None of the states that allowed it, did that. Once one state is ordered by SCOTUS to destroy those ballots, all the other states that did same in violation of their state's Constitutions will have to do the same, since they will be subject to the same SCOTUS decision.

He also said don't be discouraged to vote by mail which Trump said you shouldn't so he could get more votes in person which is the whole reason he lost, Biden really encouraged the mail in vote and Trump said the opposite and he wonders why he lost lol!!. Its funny how easy ppl can be fooled by not taking into account the whole context of what he is saying. People like to cut bits and pieces out here and there to make it look like he said something else, nice try but once again FAIL. Trump lost and that's it. His main message here is not to be intimidated to VOTE that is the whole point of this lol. He also encouraged ppl who could not get to polls in person to vote by mail. HIS MAIN MSG TO HIS BASE.....VOTE EARLY, which is exactly what they did. Our democracy is at stake, all true words he spoke which Trump and his ppl like to ignore, they take a part of what he said lol and cut out the rest.

After the primaries a court ruled *PA no longer required the signature on mail in ballots to be verified.* This leaves the election vulnerable to extensive fraud. Especially when people are getting ballots they did not request and other peoples ballots. Compound that with people that weren't able to vote in person because *somebody* used a mail in ballot in their name. There is no way to verify someone had their vote stolen nor is the chain of custody secure enough to locate the person that submitted it. And if you believe the postal system is secure, I invite you to mail me 500 dollars in cash in a plain envelope, write "500 dollars cash" on the envelope and mail it to me this xmas.

Don't do that. 🙄 I wasn't talking to you specifically, but apparently you had an awful lot of unsettled feelings that triggered you to respond to me. So, first and foremost, I must say, just because you make a "6 figure" income doesn't mean you're well educated. Then again, maybe that's something I don't have to explain to you. Secondly, if you're so well educated then you would clearly see that he was talking about the task force they've created to keep elections (SINCE the Obama administration) running as smoothly as possible with as little voter fraud as possible. Thirdly, this may come as an assumption since I don't know you personally, but I'm assuming you're a republican who is worried about voter fraud taking place because the people have chosen Biden/Harris as their new president. Let me just remind you, those same ballots coming in have also given the Republican senate the majority rule. Which is wonderful to keep a healthy checks and balances. I'm sure most Republicans are happy to have seen that occur. There isn't some big conspiracy. You're just hurt because someone you trusted and believed in has used manipulation tactics and gaslighting measures to keep you obsessed with him so he can use you as a pawn to the top of his power hungry ego mountain. I'm glad you're prosperous and think I'm a bore.

Also there should be no mail in voting period with the exception of if they request an absentee ballot. If you want to vote without going to the polls you should request an absentee ballot no problem( There should be no ballots just mailed out without a request). Also everyone who votes should have a photo I'D that way the polls know exactly who you are. These are not unreasonable rules to follow and should not be objectionable to anyone at all !!

It's a metaphysical rule. Biden admits to committing voter fraud! People are already so used to him talking demented nonsense that such a statement is reflexively put into that category, but one has to review each case individually. In this case, he speaks particularly carefully and concentrated and does not correct himself. That was not a slip-up like others, that was meant exactly as he said it. They are dark occultists, they have to publicly reveal what they are doing to avoid the karmic back-lash of their frauds. They are stealing the election and they are admitting it!

Amazing!! At the Start of the Interview, the Skin Head said that Trump lobbed False accusation after False Accusation about Hunter.. He didn&#39;t say anything false.. It&#39;s already out there.. FBI and Rudy already has the Laptop, copies of the drive and OAN and a couple of others have also seen some of the videos, and they are circulating on the Internet.. You have to agree you are 18 or older because, the first 9 released are more of a Porn show than anything else.. And, there is a Congresspersons daughter (Under Age) involved in some of them.. NOTHING WAS FALSE.. THIS WAS SCRIPTED!! AND JOE SLIPPED OFF OF SCRIPT.. <br /><br />Poor Joe.. He talks with so many people about the Evils every day, he thinks he can talk in Public like he does in Private.. <br />What he said, was 100% TRUE!! In 2016 Also, just like he said.. Evidence is everywhere.. Precincts voting over 100% of the voters and the works.. Some Precincts, 100% of the vote for Obama,,, not one vote against him.. Ha.&gt;Ha..Ha... IT&#39;s TRUE!!!!

A paragon of virtue and humility, promising to adhere to modern medicine and science in the midst of a once in (at least) 100 year pandemic. In juxtaposition to his braying ass of an opponent, a frail man who can’t see beyond his own nose and spends most of his days supine, sucking his own flatulents through a straw, how could someone advocating for the learned advice of doctors or even a well-heeled shade-tree bone saw be misgiven in comparison. Truly, in this election, Joseph Biden is the righteous and only option. Good form you cat’s paw. Good form.

In January, President Trump affirmed America’s commitment to promoting conservation efforts by announcing that the United States would join the World Economic Forum’s One Trillion Trees Initiative to plant, grow, conserve, and restore trees on American soil and around the world. The goal of the One Trillion Trees initiative is to protect and restore one trillion trees by 2030. <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/president-trump-signs-one-trillion-trees-executive-order-promoting-conservation-regeneration-nations-forests/">https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/president-trump-signs-one-trillion-trees-executive-order-promoting-conservation-regeneration-nations-forests/</a>	UCM8kAv4EUd0pNuLd4Yetj3w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCM8kAv4EUd0pNuLd4Yetj3w	0

Turns out the GOP are full of fecal matter. Who would've thought? As for turnout. Yeah, we know how much of a cult the Trump supporter base is, we know how much you venerate your failed billionaire conman. We know how much you all relish in the opportunity of being near your glorious leader. What you don't seem to grasp is that its Trumps unpopularity with his non-supporter base that caused this massive turnout. People aren't excited for Biden, they are eager to get Trump out. Besides, Biden and his supporters actually cared about covid and social distancing.. You know, unlike Trumpsters who coughed in each others mouths for fun? Yeah im not surprised if Biden is just giving empty promises at this point, the democrats have been at a stalemate with the GOP for ages now. Nothing is going to happen when the GOP is still alive. If we could just get rid of the damn electoral college and actually turn the US into a real democracy maybe the dems would have a chance at making the changes they keep promising. Until then.. You do know that the Electoral college is the only thing propping up the GOP right? You know that the Republicans pretty much always lose the popular vote right?

It doesnt take a genius to see Trump had WAYYYYYY more people supporting him. You can't deny that. Well- I guess you could . . . bc that is what I have seen from the hater's for 4 years now. Secondly- Biden is talking about OLD, OLD, NOTHING NEW problems, yet in 47 yrs he NEVER did ANYTHING about those things! Don't overlook that included being in the SECOND MOST POWERFUL POSITION for EIGHT FULL YEARS, yet you still believe he is going to "fix" things. SMH In his own words- "Come on man!"

By this, I mean they&#39;ve generally been up to exactly what they were busy accusing foes, both perceived and real, of doing. With respect to their allegations of voting fraud, we should be very, very sensitive to the possibility that this is yet another example of the same thing. We need to pay close attention and remain alert to this possibility. Look under every rock, because you&#39;ll likely find a Trumper there.

Breathing issues I have had my ENTIRE life have ended up only being something I have to live with here on the shore. Within 30 minutes of being on this side of the Bay Bridge or the Bridge Tunnel I am hitting my rescue inhaler again. Thank You VP Biden for creating a plan that will literally help thousands of us on Delmarva breathe Easier. <br />And as a mother I can personally attest to this exact agricultural pollution in our estuaries and Bay. 2 years ago my little girl spend 4 days hospitalized over the Memorial Day weekend with an Ecoli infection in her kidneys that she got by walking out in the water for less than 5 minutes on a Tuesday after heavy rains the 2. Days prior. I had her in the Dr Twice and he couldn&#39;t figure out what antibiotic was going to work. It too the hospital NINE different tries before they found the right IV antibiotic to combat that strain for the lab said was directly related to the agricultural manure run off. If our children aren&#39;t save wading in the river at OXFORD, we have a serious health risk going on. <br /><br />I&#39;ll contact your campaign &amp; gladly let you use both our stories if you need to.

Given countless hours of free time &amp; thousands of dollars to the party.<br />Like most people i have been glued to the news the past year <br />MSNBC became the Biden show early on.<br />After he said I wont change the Trump tax cuts it seem like all of the media jump on board.<br />Warren was in first place.<br />She had plans to help people.<br />Biden had no plans.<br />He waa riding on the fact that he was Obama&quot;s VP NOTHING ELSE!<br />When Warren was in first place I noticed a campain by the media against her.<br />I would her the ecacr same words be spoken by all. &#39; she cant beat Trump. The country is not ready for a women&#39;<br />MSNBC became the anti Warren pro Biden show.<br />It came down from Den.headquarters to push Biden, Warren cant win.<br />SOON EVERY DEMOCRAT WAS CONVINCED WARREN CANT WIN.<br />No I wasnt for Warrn or Berni.<br />Then the primary voting started.<br />Biden LOST every state.<br />The American people saw a frail old man with dementia who could not finish a sentence without a gaff.<br />Tom Perez took money from Bloomsberg, changed the rules for him &amp; would prefer a misogynist Republican win rather then any Democrat running.<br />I took notes.<br />MSNBC &amp; all other media outlets became the Bloomberg. Show.<br />Go back &amp; watch morning Joe &amp; Deadline White House.<br />It wadnt about the American people.<br />It was about Taxes.<br />Both Biden &amp; Bloomberg promised Not to change Trump tax cuts.<br />Biden should have lost n. Carolina.<br />Clayburn said a vote for Biden was a vote for Obama.<br />Give me a fucking break.<br />Why didnt any of you folks pick up on it?<br />The debate. Included Bloombetg &amp; with one sentence Warren flatten him.<br />Warren.<br />Warren would make a great president.<br />Biden ignored every demograhic except black women.<br />He even ignored black men.<br />When he promised the supreme court to a black women he lost every black &amp; white msn I know.<br />What happened to being quslified for a job? This is why so many angry male groups have appeared.<br />He lucked out in the first debate.<br />There is a good reason biden could not win in his prime.<br />The second debate proved that.<br />He is not qualified!<br />We have been duped.<br />He is the same coin as Trump just the other side.<br />It doesnt matter who wins.<br />The same people who control Trump control Biden.<br />I quit the democratic party.<br />Tom Perez ... Hours before super Tuesday suddenly canadates drop out! They were that afraid of Berni &amp; Warren! Who had actual plans for the Middle class.<br />No I am not a Berni bro.<br />I am a women in her 60s.<br />I have seen a lot.<br />Robert Kennedy&#39;s assassination to Obama being swore in.<br />I never saw what happened in this election. Maybe it wasn&#39;t so obvious.<br />Trump is an awful man.<br />The money men behind Biden the media &amp; the DNC are just as awful.<br />We have been bamboozled. ( old term but just as aged as malarkey.)<br />If I could I would move.<br />I am very upset.<br />I love my country.<br />It took a virus to be able to have the time to analyze the media boh left &amp; right.<br />He is not qualified.<br />I feel not screwed but raped by a priest because I always thought we were the good guys.<br />Not proofing if I do i would probably delete it.<br />Many people feel the way I do.<br />Trump is goung to win based on Biden&#39;s comments on oil &amp; raising. taxes alone because Biden should never have been our candidate &amp; dems need over 65% of the votes to win thanks to gerrymandering.<br />I&#39;m sick over this.

THE PEOPLE WANNA KNOW!] and 2) PLEASE do a video showcasing ALL THE PEOPLE (you can find-there surely are tons more) who have either been fired or &#39;resigned&#39; under Trump and compare it to average normal folks. I get that people do a job that&#39;s high-stress and quit after a couple of years if they can&#39;t handle it, sure, but... come on, this guy has them in and out in a few MONTHS repeatedly for the same office... like anyone who has to be near him enough to either upset him with honesty or be upset BY him when assessing the situation honestly... they bail/are told &#39;resign or be fired&#39; Apprentice style. Please give us an evaluation! I&#39;m super curious how y&#39;all will deliver such intriguing reports. <br /><br />My original rambling on and on comment:<br />Know what I would really love to see? It&#39;s backwards as timelines go, but can OBAMA be in Biden&#39;s cabinet? Can he be the guy to restore our foreign relations? Why, you ask? BECAUSE THE WHOLE WORLD F&#39;KN LOVES BARRACK OBAMA! Seriously, the whole world LOVES that man and no one can restore our international relations the way he can. Secretary of State, please? After all, you can be part of the cabinet-even in the line of succession-as someone who cannot technically succeed (Elaine Chao is one such example)... and Elizabeth Warren for Secretary of Education, pretty please while we&#39;re at it. Bloomberg is suited for the Treasury, and Bernie can do a myriad of jobs-energy, veteran&#39;s affairs (though some think him protesting Vietnam disqualifies him, I don&#39;t), Housing&amp;Urban Dev., or maybe my fave, the Interior which is currently-eep!-held by an oil lobbyist, last thing you want for someone responsible for protecting federal lands! While usually a doctor would hold the post, Sanders could do Health and Human services and get REAL Medicare for all established under Biden as his final cherry on top of an amazing career-go figure ELI LILLY, where the current Sec of Health+HS was PRESIDENT before taking the position [guy before him, an actual doc not executive, &quot;resigned&quot; as have so many under Trump]... Oh, and the idea of a Secretary or Director of Climate (the President CAN create such a thing and SHOULD bc it and energy need their own separate departments even if they will at some point work together... you can toss that in, too. I believe the DEPUTY of the cabinet positions is ALSO typically President-chosen; otherwise there wouldn&#39;t be so many people who were the deputies 2017-x who are now the Secretary of <i>_</i> 100% Republican, 97% vile, 3% decentish as far as we can decipher.<br /><br />Random but of 23 cabinet positions, under Trump only THREE are women, all notoriously bad for most people, most=anyone not super wealthy AND &quot;Christian&quot; [=nothing like Christ but abusing the name to gain leverage with people who think that&#39;s the #1 qualifier, as if Trump SAYING he&#39;s suddenly a Christian now that it&#39;s convenient makes him one, him and Melania who doesn&#39;t &#39;give a fk about Christmas&#39; and seems to have retaliated by making two rows of trees be covered in blood red [something]... (The 3 women in the current cabinet: 1) the Sec. of Transportation who happens to be Mitch McConman&#39;s wife [and happens to have, as Sec of Labor and now of Transportation, made a pathway for many of her husband&#39;s pet projects, 2) the &quot;end public education and use education to build God&#39;s kingdom&quot; demon from hell who is the current Sec. of Education-the only woman eligible to be President among them [Mitch&#39;s wifey is a natural-born citizen, conveniently], and 3) the also-brutal Director of the CIA who was the Deputy director and replaced Pompeo when he was promoted to Sec of State in 2018-note a man was promoted to that important office-Gina Haspel, who both parties have issues with since she participated in waterboarding and other forms of torture and destroyed tapes <del>of</del> said torture when running one of Bush&#39;s black sites; even Republicans have a problem with her, but violence-loving [&quot;like a TV drama!&quot;] Trump doesn&#39;t, sigh)... As a woman, I&#39;m horrified that these are the people of my gender put in leadership positions! We need the Ayanna Presley kinds of experienced and understanding-in-depth (and in her case first person or very close to it) in positions like HUD Secretary. It&#39;s a wee bit early for AOC, Tlaib, etc. Gotta kick some @$$ and take some names of the GOP first, ideally kicking them not just out of position but into a prison for the crimes they&#39;ve no doubt committed in many cases. Still, while indeed most in cabinet positions should be highly experienced, it wouldn&#39;t hurt to have some in their 40s&amp;50s, not just retirement aged experienced ones (especially considering, yknow, succession AND ideally having some of these people serve 8, 12, or 16 years, even, in the cabinet then going for the Presidency. :)	UCI2AuWzRlb2EfvkbImcTsgQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI2AuWzRlb2EfvkbImcTsgQ	0

(FYI, a big chunk of the MAGA folks think the moon landing never happened. OOPS.) As for high speed Internet, good luck regaining &quot;ownership&quot; of the infrastructure RoadRunner/Comcast/Qwest etc own-granted the infrastructure WAS paid for through taxes in most cases because yknow you can&#39;t go tearing roads up as a telecommunications company, but still, good luck not pissing them off royally by suddenly going in the most hyper-liberal Scandinavian kind of set up, the national high speed which somehow will have service to the most remote places which right now is HORRIBLY expensive-you either have to use satellite or run hundreds-thousands of miles of wires for just a few people here and there and maintain them because our guidelines require rapid repair... yeah, good luck, folks. It&#39;ll have to be DSL for most of the nation... I live somewhere that has a partial (stalled before it got to my &#39;hood though it&#39;s there on 3 sides of me less than half a mile away, grr) city FIOS that costs $35/month or is part of the rent for buildings it&#39;s set up in... Greatest infrastructure system is so vague you can claim it a million ways, but that usually starts with roads, and that... requires... TAXATION. Where does Trump think our funding comes from, exactly? China? Foreign gifts to the monarchy to remain at peace? UGH. Okay, I&#39;ll stop and return to the conversation between decent, intelligent humans. To think I only got 11 mins in before being aggravated by some Trump idiocy. Even here.

An absolute massive Trump landslide obviously based on the incredible amount of support he gets anywhere he goes verses the none that Biden gets. The other option is CNN.... I mean Biden barely winning. When this happens it tells you that the election was rigged. First because seriously no one with even half a brain would vote for this guy. Come on man.... Aside from all his corruption he is a great old grand dad but president of the US.... are you kidding me???!!! You don&#39;t appoint Mr. Dress up to lead the most powerful country in the world.<br /><br />Second when it comes to rigged elections they always make the outcome close. First so it does not look too suspicious and second to make the losing side think &quot;dam... we almost got it!!!&quot; so they will quietly move on. If the democrats really are as dumb as they look and Biden did &quot;win&quot; so to speak with a landslide then there will be civil war because no half intelligent self respecting American could or would ever buy that...

This climate change is being created by three things 1. Arsonist in California 2. The cutting down for sixty years the Brazilian rain forest and 3. In Pine Ridge Alaska the turning on of the Doomsday Machine in 1979 that has the power to create weather and destroy the ozone layer. So why are the Democrats so big on climate change ....again, control of We The People by restricting travel and forcing us buy electric cars full of their cancer creating gadgets that can track every move and sound you make, people your being played. Meet the new boss same as the old boss. The question is: Will We Get Fooled Gain but, were all Slaves To Big Buisness that took over this Country a hundred years ago.

The whole bioweb is being ripped apart from the bottom up. Talking about weather and &#39;climate&#39; limits people&#39;s understanding, though it is easier for them to grasp than the enormity of our peril. We don&#39;t need any particular country&#39;s president &quot;to lead the world&quot; - we need national leaders who won&#39;t constantly think they are entitled to &#39;place number one&#39; as if by divine right. America needs a co-operative president, and America needs to stop elbowing its way to the front of every assembly. America needs to learn how to learn from others and be willing to adopt &#39;world&#39;s best practice&#39; rather than needing every wheel to be labelled &#39;[re-]invented in America&#39;.

Joe can pretend it's about decency because he has no real ammo anyway.	UCi3-Muw3_Fwj0phxPAOY-Kg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi3-Muw3_Fwj0phxPAOY-Kg	1	Ugyh0MbhNclpXzfPndd4AaABAg	Leighanne Paris

What they&#39;ve done, is that they have googled Joes election program, have found the closest commercial match to said program .. which is Tesla/SpaceX aka Elon Musk ... and then listed the parts of Elons vision, that Joe Biden hasn&#39;t covered yet. While they did that, they&#39;ve basically told SpaceX and their 8000 employees to f*** o**, cause &quot;we&quot; are going to take over now. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s good for job creation. Nor is the election program very inventive.	UCdbxKoDUAeSTCNsIojEVmnw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdbxKoDUAeSTCNsIojEVmnw	0

LMAO!!! you do realize he meant they put together a system/organization that CAN FIGHT AGAINST VOTER FRAUD that's why he said its extensive and inclusive. He also said don't be discouraged to vote by mail which Trump said you shouldn't so he could get more votes in person which is the whole reason he lost, Biden really encouraged the mail in vote and Trump said the opposite and he wonders why he lost lol!!. Its funny how easy ppl can be fooled by not taking into account the whole context of what he is actually saying. People like to cut bits and pieces out here and there to make it look like he said something else, nice try but once again FAIL. Trump lost and that's it. His main message here is not to be intimidated to VOTE that is the whole point of this lol. He also encouraged ppl who could not get to polls in person to vote by mail. HIS MAIN MSG TO HIS BASE.....VOTE EARLY, which is exactly what they did.

Actually I think that's why he lost a lot of votes with women, his attitude and character just sucks and he is a liar almost everything he says is bs. Jan 2021 can't get here soon enough imo. Also Biden said Trump will be forcibly removed if he does not go on his own that will be fun to watch if it happens I'm gonna get my popcorn ready. Also speaking about issues with mail ballots is inadvertently telling ppl not to vote that way DUHHH lol. He literally said voting that way don't work he discouraged ppl from voting that way hence they didn't so they mostly came in person to do it. Biden ppl did vote mostly mail in cuz he told them to do so and cuz of the pandemic which Trump and his ppl don't give a shit about obviously, get it now lol?? Either way Biden is PRESIDENT ELECT and Trump is about to be dealing with lawsuits in about 3 months time maybe sooner can't wait to see that.

He also said don't be discouraged to vote by mail which Trump said you shouldn't so he could get more votes in person which is the whole reason he lost, Biden really encouraged the mail in vote and Trump said the opposite and he wonders why he lost lol!!. Its funny how easy ppl can be fooled by not taking into account the whole context of what he is saying. People like to cut bits and pieces out here and there to make it look like he said something else, nice try but once again FAIL. Trump lost and that's it. His main message here is not to be intimidated to VOTE that is the whole point of this lol. He also encouraged ppl who could not get to polls in person to vote by mail. HIS MAIN MSG TO HIS BASE.....VOTE EARLY, which is exactly what they did.

In case you're wondering, infer means to deduce or conclude (something) from evidence and reasoning rather than from explicit statements. For example from this information we can infer that you can't figure something out unless someone explicitly says something or explains it to you.

One of the biggest reasons is I&#39;ve seen him change his mind and positions when presented with a strong alternative. That being said, I was disheartened by his comments about the industrial animal agriculture model. Just fixing the environmental harms of chicken, hog and dairy factories isn&#39;t enough. This factory approach to animal production has destroyed family farmers, ranchers and dairy producers. I&#39;ve watched it happen. It has also destroyed our relationship with the animals we are producing for our food. We need to treat these animals with respect and honor instead of packing them into confinement facilities and treating them like a cog in a giant meat and milk production machine. <br />My family has farmed for over 100 years in South Dakota and while we have gotten bigger, the relationship we have with our animals and land is still a relationship of honor and respect. A few weeks ago, during harvest, a blind calf got out and wandered off. My brother and his family took over 4 hours out of a busy day to find this calf and make sure it was returned safely. They didn&#39;t make any money from those hours or advance the important work of the farm, but it was important the calf was found because we owed it to her to take care of her. She&#39;s now safely returned and lives with her seeing-eye Holstein, who does a pretty good job of looking over her.<br />Our agricultural policies need to advance a model of food production based upon family farmers, ranchers and dairy producers. People who will stop what they are doing and find the lost animal.<br />Thank you again.	UCoTABOB9j3GgMb1hSWF39Cw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoTABOB9j3GgMb1hSWF39Cw	0

Generally no, because politicians are not people that usually express truths or untruths, they express opinions. Now, occationally, politicians claim something that could be either true or untrue and in that case we can always do a fact check. So let's do a fact check here. Biden said "we have put together I think the most extensive and inclusive voter fraud organization in the history of american politics." Ok, here it is: https://democrats.org/where-we-stand/the-issues/vote/. You can read about this organization on that page. You can also call them at the number presented on the website. What he said next was "What the president (Donald Trump) is trying to do is discourage people from voting by impying that their vote won't be counted, it can't be counted, 'we're gonna challenge it', and all these things". Ok, so what he's saying is that Trump is allegedly discouraging people from voting, and that's not very democratic, it's actually a serious threat to democracy. So, putting two and two together, I would assume that this voter fraud organization is an organization to protect voters from "Voter purging. Voter fraud. Voter suppression." as stated on their website. I can see how some people see the word FRAUD and then jump to a conclusion that he's talking about him winning the election fraudulently, I can see this because I know that there are many people that are much less intelligent than myself, so it's really no surprise to me that people think this way.

What he's saying is that if you haven't voted already, go do it. If you already voted, then get the people around you to go and vote, because everyone that CAN vote SHOULD vote. If you can vote there's no reason not to. He doesn't care who you vote for, as long as you vote. That's why their voter fraud organization is INCLUSIVE. Doesn't matter if you vote for Biden or Trump, you can still call their number and talk to a lawyer if there's anything that you feel is fraudulent when it comes to casting your vote, to make sure your vote is counted and that no one is manipulating it.

That's why I said it's laughable when people say that Biden is somehow talking about some illegal fraud operation to fraudulently win the election. It's absurd to a degree that is just incomprehensible to anyone with more than 10 brain cells. All Biden was saying is that people need to go and vote and they shouldn't be discouraged by anyone's attempt to tell them that their vote will be challenged or that it won't be counted as Trump is trying to do. Trump is just a typical dictator and it's frightening that so many people don't see it.

Why would you think this voter fraud organization is pro fraud? Like wtf? Is it just because it's Biden? What if republicans set up a voter fraud organization, would it then suddenly be anti-fraud, just because it's republicans? The voter fraud organization is an organization that was set up to prevent people from being discouraged from voting. After this so called "confession" he also mentions that they have thousands of lawyers that you can call, and the point of that is to assist with legal advice regarding anything that you experience in the process of voting that you think may be fraudulent or in any way makes it difficult or prevents you from voting, because the organisation DOESN'T want people to get discouraged from going to vote simply from hearing Trump or anyone else say that their vote won't be counted or any other method that someone has to make it difficult for people to vote. People need to know that their vote is going to be counted, no matter who they vote for. Trump and his supporters are just acting like toddlers that are salty because they're not likely getting what they wants this time, and since Trump can't buy a presidency, he's simply just gonna throw a tantrum.

Also I have stated plenty of times why I dislike Trump its all in my comments you just have to go back and read it, look a little harder. Its pretty obvious why a lot of ppl don't like Trump I mean even a little kid can figure out he is a bully. I guess Trump Supporters have not got the memo yet. For the record I don't listen to media I do my research read up on my info to come up with my conclusions about Trump and the ppl that support him. Trump does hate everyone though who isn't on his side lol. What am I missing here lol?? He don't like ppl of color, he does not condemn the KKK for some odd reason lol, he does not like immigrants, he makes fun of ppl with disabilities, he don't respect women or minorities, he disrespects war veterans, talks bad about Mexicans, has done racist things towards black people in the past etc..... Separates kids from their families who still can't REUNITE with their families. I mean the list goes on and on not sure what you are talking about lol. Only people Trump don't hate is his family of course, SOME Republicans, and his brainwashed base/the right wing media cuz they kiss his ass and worship him like he can do no wrong. Why would he hate those people, they are on his side lol??? Everyone else though, even some who worked under him mean nothing to him as he has shown on plenty of occasions. You can't disagree with him or he bullies you like he did with Joe Biden calling him Sleepy the whole campaign like that's not disrespectful in itself. The only bullshit I see is what comes from Trump, his supporters and his dumbass lawyer Rudy. All a bunch of liars/cons claiming things they can't prove in courts just because they are in denial and a bunch of sore losers not to mention hypocrites as well. Also, I never said Biden was a perfect candidate with a perfect past but if you are trying to compare him to Trump and all his words and HIS past lol its a no brainer Biden wins by a country mile probably even more so lol its not even close actually HOW MUCH better Biden will be as president for the WHOLE country than Trump was. Biden will actually know how to lead and direct a country through a crisis right now which Trump was unable to. Not to mention Biden will be for all Americans not just those who voted for him. Trump was not he put his people against the other side, that is not what a president does I'm sorry. Trump was for his base and those who kissed his ass, the other side which is basically half the country who don't support him he neglected and treated like shit for 4 years so I mean its about time and a relief that came to an end in my opinion. Quite frankly 80 million people plus were fed up with Trump and collectively voted him out, essentially fired him which is ironic considering that is what he was used to doing to so many other people. Trump has created many more enemies in the 4 years he has been office, go figure. Anyways I'm just happy Biden and Kamala will be in the White House come 2021 about time, 4 years too late if you ask me.

It wasn't HIS TO AUTOMATICALLY have once again just because he is president. Now he is messing with the WILL OF THE VOTERS and that's a serious problem, one you would see in dictator countries not in the USA, he is making a joke of the process and election system. I DO KNOW what he meant by that, its not my fault Trump ppl are trying to spin it into something negative when Biden was just trying to encourage his supporters to vote and vote early by calling THE ORGANIZATION I listed to make sure their vote was counted. Also to discourage fraud which Trump is doing or attempting to do at least out in the open now with nobody on the right having a problem with it. As I mentioned the number I listed was for the democratic organization to get your vote counted, it was clear to me BY WATCHING the whole video that is what he meant CONTEXT is important here once again. Also the PEOPLE who voted for Biden are also American citizens, lets not forget that and they have spoken. All 80 million or so of them. Trump NEEDS TO MOVE ON pretty soon here because he is really getting on ppl's nerves now impeding the transition from the incoming president, blocking the Biden team from getting critical information to save American lives from the virus . Trump is acting like a very sore loser baby and his behavior would not be accepted from Republicans if Trump was for the democrats, they let him get away with too much and his supporters fall for everything that comes out of his mouth. Trump is acting very un presidential and I for one can't wait to see him outta there and welcome in Joe and Kamala come January 2021.

UgxT3XtQBbC_jcMlFA94AaABAg.9FEwFDY3vxO9GM6_SvSarD		0	2020-11-22 07:20:57	Matthew R	@NightRunner Well I'm not a Trump fan so you won't get much good that he has done from me, but some have said he helped further the economy but to me he has done more for the rich than the poor or middle class. Not surprised since he is part of the elite. Bad he has DONE A LOT BAD it would take a long time to describe everything. I will just give a general overview though as best I can, pretty much put Americans against each other with his language was racism towards any minority, incited violence against others insulted Asian American ppl Arab American ppl and Latino American ppl as criminals. Very divisive with his words. Put ppl against the media bullied ppl fired ppl separated children from their families. Degraded women disrespected anyone who was against him. Accepted money from foreign governments. Won't show his tax returns leading many to conclude he committed some sort of fraud. Was a president for only his supporters not the WHOLE country. Started fights with other countries and world leaders and allies like Canada. Made ppl hate each other and other countries hate the USA as well. Lied about MANY things, pretty much he is the worst president I can ever remember being a president for the US lol. He has done so much damage and created chaos in the country. There are more things that I can't remember off the top of my head, but the worst thing he has done imo is IGNORE the covid 19 virus in the States for months, he took it as a joke like it would go away on its own and said it was a poor ppl virus, he infected ppl around him and in the White House and his actions or lack of actions have led to the US having the most cases and deaths in the world. NOW!!! after all that he is impeding ANOTHER PERSON who beat him in an election from getting vital information which any other president would hand over, he is hurting democracy and being selfish claiming he won and its fraud when its not and just basically delaying everything for his own personal gain. THAT IS WHY HE IS BAD lol. So hopefully that answer makes it clear for you. Trump also had SUPER SPREADER rallies with NO MASKS or distancing not caring about that the virus is out there and infecting ppl he was and IS the worst leader in that role I have ever seen, he also insulted science and doctors who tried to help ppl with the virus by informing the ppl giving updates on how bad it is.

That is called CONTEXT for anyone who is confused about this concept. Are ppl really this stupid though, that they think he would make a whole video this long in an interview just to say at the end that he has a voter fraud organization lol???. I guess that is what ppl want to believe and want him to say but its not the reality, they have to accept Trump is done lol and that's it stop trying to spin things to make it work in your favor when its not going that way. But anyhow thanks for explaining it now maybe more ppl CAN ACTUALLY understand what is being said, I bet you most ppl just skipped to that part without even bothering to understand or watch the WHOLE video to get an idea of what the msg is behind everything he is saying. People only hear what they want to hear and bits and pieces of things that ARE NOT ACTUALLY what is being said lol. Guess many ppl didn't finish school here.

Rest assured Trump will be in legal trouble after all this is done and Biden will be sworn in January 2021 and there is nothing Trump his ppl or anyone associated with him can do about that. Biden got more votes point blank period. MORE ppl wanted him in the White House as opposed to Trump that's how an election works in case you didn't know, both sides have a chance to win and Biden won. Not just news outlets called Biden the winner, ALMOST EVERYONE ELSE HAS including some Republicans and world leaders. Only ones still in denial are you ppl Trump, his lawyers and his team and of course any media associated with these dummies. Its over mark my words nothing will change and if it does I will personally admit I was wrong but I won't have to I know that. YOU ppl won't admit you were wrong though that I'm almost certain of.

He incited hostility against others who did not like or agree with him and was not a president for all, just for his base. This includes the media, the left and many democrats, put ppl against these ppl at an alarming rate. Biden will be for ALL Americans whether you like him or not or whether you agree with his policies/plans or not. That Russian thing was huge at the time and it was worth investigating either way his whole presidency was surrounded by shady shit. My whole thing was how hostile Trump and his supporters were of anyone that opposed him that it was irked me the most out of anything to be honest its one thing not to agree but to verbally attack and assault ppl who don't like Trump is another level many on the right took and that is what I personally took offense to. There was no respect anymore for differences of opinion and a lot of that was brought on by Trump's divisive attitude and rhetoric. Not to mention the right and republicans are now threatening to not accept and push back on all things Biden including his presidency so if you think that about the democrats the republicans are not any better just saying......but to each his own we are on opposite sides of the fence and that's fine with me. Biden will try to unite the country and mend and heal as he has stated with whoever is willing and wants peace, others who want violence and division like Trump cannot be helped and saved if they don't try they can keep attending Trump rallies but far far away from the White House imo. Biden has to start by getting a handle on this coronavirus which Trump and his team totally fucked the country on and he has to help ppl communicate respect and accept each other again because right now its very divisive ppl hate each other and that is mostly thanks to Mr. One Term Trump.

The same thing ppl did for Trump for 4 years and have to speak for him cuz he miss spoke so many times. You going to tell me ppl never spoke for Trump about what he ACTUALLY meant to say lol instead of what came out of his mouth?? Also if there is fraud which has not been proven in a court of law thus far mind you, it would be for both sides not just one side or another things don't work like that. His mind is not shot and 78 million ppl voted him in because they do not believe that either. He is the guy to replace Trump and fix that idiots mess considering how he left the country. He is not a corpse and if he is then what is Trump lol they are basically the same age except Trump the crook is orange and fat and about to be bombarded with lawsuits, once he leaves the office that is thank god about time. The only puppets here are the Republicans and Trump's zombie like base who basically COPY/OBEY everything Trump says and does. I bet you if he told you all to jump off a cliff there will be gold at the bottom, you ppl would gladly do it because Trump controls how you guys think and feel, I don't have that problem because I could care less what happens to him, all I know is once he leaves the White House it won't be pretty for him because he won't have his special presidential powers which he took full advantage of to lean on anymore. He is the only president to LOSE the popular vote TWICE and is about to be dragged out of the White House in January if he doesn't smarten up.

ALL FRAUD claims are baseless TRUMP DID NOT WIN the election "buddy". The only ones who think otherwise are Trump his camp/lawyers and of course his base anyone outside of this circle knows Biden will be the next president. Also Trump can do whatever the fuck he wants but it won't change the outcome that Biden will be president lol. And when every lawsuit he does continues to be thrown out and you still have him not accepting things and helping the Biden team transition in then hes gonna look more stupid than he already does in the delaying of the process in which Biden needs to go in there and fix Trump's mess. That's okay we will deal with it cuz Trump is the biggest sore loser baby I have ever seen and his base are idiots for believing everything this liar says. Republicans are hypocrites as well because if a democratic president was acting this way they would be all over him, but because its Trump they got nothing to say. Trump will be gone by 2021 so I'm not worried and if he don't leave Biden already said he will forcibly remove him so let him do what he wants while he still has the attention because his time is running out pretty soon here and it will be 4 years too late. Clinton actually called Trump to tell him ya okay you won, but as you may recall Trump was an asshole to her as well calling her names and bullying her as he did to Joe Biden hes a bully and cries about it if he don't get his way. Why should Clinton have been nice to him with the way he treated her? Also NO FRAUD CLAIM HAS BEEN PROVEN IN A COURT OF LAW just a bunch of idiots going around claiming things and saying things with NO ACTUAL evidence concrete that is that was proven in a court of law just lies things that have been debunked and conspiracy theories that's why they are throwing out Trump lawsuits all over the country. 60 percent of the country is brainwashed by Trump and his lies. 78 MILLION plus people know who the real president will be and that is JOE BIDEN. And what is fucking hilarious is how stupid you people are, so only cuz Trump don't win its rigged LMAO!!! he said that last time that if he don't win its rigged. THE PRESIDENCY is not his to KEEP, or by right his, yes it is a democracy and MORE PPL voted for Biden and that was their right so Trump should get his ass outta there soon cuz MORE THAN half the country is fed up with his BS and his supporters. You ppl think that he should automatically be handed the presidency just because, THATS NOT HOW IT WORKS, its an election and the results show your boy lost and that the more time goes by with his denial the more ppl hes gonna piss off either way hes done January 2021 so time is ticking for him, can't wait. When he leaves lawsuits await him, so he better have good lawyers cuz they are coming for him and I wouldn't be surprised to see that orange clown go to jail actually either way once he leaves he is in a world of trouble, starting with TAX FRAUD, yes that's right he is gonna be the first president to actually be a criminal what a joke lmao!! He is also the first president to lose the popular vote TWICE, that's how many ppl don't want this guy and never wanted him in the first place in there.

He obviously got through to them which is evident by the election they actually came out this time. Last time ppl expected I think Hillary to win and did not bother to come out but when Trump won they were mistaken so this time democrats and those who did not vote for Trump last time came out and made sure that didn't happen again thanks to the Biden Obama and the rest of his team going out to rallies telling them to vote vote vote and early if possible, His msg got through good on them and that consistency in his msg to his base and his ppl is going to reward him with the presidency come 2021. Trump meanwhile talked shit about mail in votes said they don't work his base ate up came out to vote mostly in person on the day of the election and expected that to be enough to get Trump in there again. This time they were mistaken and that is thanks to Trump and his words and his msg. Anyways good on the Biden team and the democrats they delivered, that is what I feel but you know to each his or her own everyone has their own way of looking at things.

This is not the CCP this is the USA and we are a democracy. Your going to just have to deal with it now...just like we had to deal with it for 3-4 years with the “Russian Collusion” hoax. Ironic though is the fact that Clinton STILL has not conceded to Trump and never will...lol...but you want Trump to concede after one week when there is legitimate allegation of election fraud and 60% of the country believes there was and is not confident in the 2020 election process and results.

The courts are already deciding by throwing out Trump lawsuits I think that speaks for itself there to the validity of these claims. "had there been" ya but no fraud has ACTUALLY been proven in a court of law enough to change the outcome of this election in which Biden is right now as we speak the president elect so there is a lot ifs and maybes going on and the other side is tired of it and this Trump dude they have had to deal with his antics for 4 years now its time for him to step aside and let Biden try and fix his mess that he left and that Biden and his team are inheriting. Problem is I don't think Trump is capable of being the bigger man and stepping up with the transition of the Biden team his ego and babyish sore loserness attitude won't allow that to happen. The coronavirus is the biggest concern right now everything else pales in comparison, many families have lost loved ones due to how Trump handled this and they will never forget it nor ever forgive him for that. Especially with knowledge he knew way in advance how this would impact ppl but chose to ignore it months prior. Ya and for the record I trust Biden way more than I trust that idiot Trump and I think 77 million ppl plus would agree with me on that one, I'm glad Biden and Kamala will be our next president and VP a change was needed. Time for the Trump clown show at the white house to come to an end, the people are tired of seeing that quite frankly well the majority as the vote showed. Biden has to go in there and wipe down and disinfect everything considering Trump had the virus did not enforce wearing masks to anyone around him irresponsibly and with no regard for others had large gatherings with his rallys and briefings as well as NO social distancing what so ever, ya nuff said he needs to go and the sooner the better if you ask me. Can't wait for January 2021 and a fresh new start wipe the slate clean with a new leadership hopefully and I KNOW many other ppl feel the way I do about this situation considering the circumstances. Trump has shown little respect for Biden, so I don't know why ppl think that Trump is owed anything at this point, in the respect factor/benefit of the doubt. He has not been a "good" guy to a lot of people and that is why many dislike him and didn't vote for him.

People are getting tired and might ridicule Trump more and more. I do think people need patience. And when courts have decided, we can judge by that. Had there been fraud, it would've been the right thing to not just stand down, is there no fraud we can say in hindsight that he should have stepped down and congratulated him earlier. I just think when everything is cleared 100% up, then there can be no excuses, and he must step down, be a bigger man and help with the transition. I don't agree with how he's handled the corona virus. But i hope it won't turn out to be compromising the safety of the citizens, opening the borders. being called racist if you don't, while everyone kneels for Antifa. There's an agenda going on, and i don't trust Biden to be anything but a puppet. Anyways that's a political debate i don't want to take on youtube.

They will get there shot here starting in January 2021 many are looking forward to that, 77 million plus ppl to be exact. Those ppl think he is fit to be president so I think he deserves a chance to show what he can do and what hes got for America and the world. He wants to build up America again and mend relationships and heal the strain left by Trump and his administration lets see what they got only time will tell, but I believe they will leave the country better off than Trump has left it but again this is my opinion lets see what actually happens cuz right now America is rock bottom. Lots of bad is happening right now and that needs to be fixed its gonna take a group effort on the part of the citizens of the country.

Biden has a tall task to fix what Trump couldn't about the country in the middle of a pandemic and he is acting that way putting his need to win above the American ppl even though he did not win. To me that sounds like a spoiled baby than a president. No other president would act this way and the Republicans would not accept it if it were a president on the democratic side. But its okay cuz its Trump for him to be this way??? Like thats BS sorry. They let him get away with murder and this is just another example of that. I don't think Trump will accept defeat EVEN when it is fairly clear even now he DID NOT WIN lol. Well right now it looks like he is not right and he is pissing everyone off who are tired of him and his antics, all 77 million plus and others around the world watching how he is behaving. The only ones not annoyed or pissed about this are some Republicans, his base and Trump ppl of course everyone else can't wait to see him gone to be completely honest with you. Its fine to investigate the fraud claims but pretty soon here its gonna get old and the more time passes that he keeps acting like that when it shows Biden is the clear winner the more stupid he is going to look and the more angry ppl will get at him and his administration, just saying like ppl are tired of him literally. Also Trump lawsuits from his team are being thrown out in most courts of law across the country because they can't back it up with concrete evidence just baseless claims and conspiracy theories which are being debunked as quickly as they are being brought up. People who are not on Trump's side are fed up with his denial and his attitude and words that further put his base into delusions that he will be the next president instead of telling them okay I lost time to move on and heal the country and mend no he is making this about himself and that's not fair to Americans well the rest of them that did not vote for him. He keeps dragging it on and his base eats up for breakfast lunch and dinner. I bet you he won't even congrats Joe Biden on the win even after it shows he clearly won cuz he is not a decent person that way. He is a bully and very disrespectful part of the reason so many voted against him. Joe Biden the the president elect won the popular vote and electoral college he has nothing more to prove and especially not to Trump.

I understand what you're saying about the transition. I think even when there's the slightest of doubt when it comes to fraud, its worth looking into, that it's okay to have a critical mind, and to a certain extent, that it isn't too crazy to question it, but rather a healthy thing, so that actual fraud could be stopped. Having said that, it needs to be backed up by evidence. And luckily we have courts to decide. Once decided, he ought to help with a smooth transition as you say, and accept defeat. Had he been right about the fraud, it would be in everyone's best interest, including the democrats, that democracy isn't failing. The Republicans would be all over the democrats if it had been the other way around I'm sure as well. But i think the democrats would be in their right to investigate	UC_uKpHo4OUNnTVc0HIKME5Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_uKpHo4OUNnTVc0HIKME5Q	1	UgxT3XtQBbC_jcMlFA94AaABAg	alan mail

He is ahead of Trump at least 5 million votes and world leaders have accepted he will be the next guy and almost everyone has declared him the winner, only ppl still in denial are Trump ppl and Republicans everyone else knows who the president will be. THE people have spoken and Biden is going to be the next president. Trump is just delaying the process because he is big sore loser who can't even lose with dignity. Instead of helping the other guy transition into the white house he it still denying everything and being difficult and not even acknowledging he could lose, he is the problem here. Any other NORMAL president would have said congrats to Biden by now. But no you have this guy acting this way and the Republicans allowing it when they know damn well if a Democratic president was acting in this manner they would be all over him. As well all of Trump teams lawsuits are being thrown out in almost every court in various states on the count of there is actually no concrete proof behind their claims just conspiracy theories that have been debunked largely, either way. Its all over for Trump soon. Kamala and Biden will be American's new leadership come 2021 about time. USA needed a change from the Trump disaster. 77 million people plus who voted for Biden are ready to turn the page and welcome a new chapter bring some respect and normalcy, calm and direction back to the white house hell back to the country for that matter.

That can't be classified as a "system" can it?. It would be enough to say, vote, whoever gets the most wins. I take his words for what they are, not what we think he meant. Overwhelm the system? If he has the power and capability to create the largest "anti" voter fraud organization, he would have no problem putting together a voter fraud. I don't know how a fraud would work, but if he's smart enough to defeat fraud, he's smart enough to create it. I imagine getting an overload of mail votes, throwing Trump's out, keeping your own, something that couldn't be possible if everyone went in person (but what do I know, I'm not a master of how to do fraud). It's skeptical that he expects more people to vote for Trump in person, he could do the same encouragement, but he seems too dependent and desperate of mail votes. history shows that it's even for democrats and Republicans how they vote. Arguing Trump encourages to go in person is an assumption that people are actually going to do it. While there's a good chance people will do what people do, take the convenient way. Why would it be harder to vote as a black person? What is the argument that it is harder for democrats to vote, than for Republicans? Are democrats crippled? Logic tells me that it would be easier to do fraud with mail, than actually showing up in person. I'm not saying I'm right, but i am saying it feels suspicious. To repeat myself, if he's smart enough to put together the largest anti fraud organization, he's smart enough to put together the largest fraud one. He knows the system, and it's naive to think fraud is an impossibility. Then you'd never question or see, if it ever did happen, because you blindly believe humans won't cheat, or that a system can't be beaten, if you're smart enough. I hope whoever the people has voted for, wins, and there's nothing wrong with challenging suspicion of fraud. What's important is the truth and the right man wins.

He also said don't be discouraged to vote by mail which Trump said you shouldn't so he could get more votes in person which is the whole reason he lost, Biden really encouraged the mail in vote and Trump said the opposite and he wonders why he lost lol!!. Its funny how easy ppl can be fooled by not taking into account the whole context of what he is saying. People like to cut bits and pieces out here and there to make it look like he said something else, nice try but once again FAIL. Trump lost and that's it. His main message here is not to be intimidated to VOTE that is the whole point of this lol. He also encouraged ppl who could not get to polls in person to vote by mail. HIS MAIN MSG TO HIS BASE.....VOTE EARLY, which is exactly what they did. Our democracy is at stake, all true words he spoke which Trump and his ppl like to ignore, they take a part of what he said lol and cut out the rest. Learn to comprehend and take the whole of what he is saying into account.	UCqKXnBKnVKHqKAjVGpInA7Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqKXnBKnVKHqKAjVGpInA7Q	1	UgxT3XtQBbC_jcMlFA94AaABAg	alan mail

We’re talking about the difference between problems that need to be resolved immediately (climate change) and projects with <b>potential</b> to be beneficial to mankind.<br /><br />That being said, having read on the possible resources identified on the Moon (precious minerals and water), I would still like to see a concerted effort by the nation sometime in the future, if not the present, to continue space exploration and research. But we cannot with good conscience give those efforts the attention it deserves without first fixing the very real and immediate threats to human existence.

It would be helpful for me to @ the people I'm talking about but about 95% of the comment section needs this. damn, never learned how to infer something? In case you're wondering, infer means to deduce or conclude (something) from evidence and reasoning rather than from explicit statements. For example from this information we can infer that you can't figure something out unless someone explicitly says something or explains it to you.

Trump condemned KKK/white supremacy. Whose cages? Obama/Biden cages! And they were actually fences built during Obama admin to protect kids &amp; women from men.

How many decades are we going to continue to hear the exact same argument with none of it coming true? When are people going to wake up and realize they are being lied to? There is no evidence that man made Climate change is real. NONE. Every single prediction that has ever been made about CC has never come true. <br /><br />This moron Biden talks about forest burn acreage as proof of it. How about you take a look at how much burn acreage we had in the 1930&#39;s. Almost 2.5 times as much as today, yet that was natural and this is climate change? GTFOH!<br /><br />Polar caps are going to continue to melt... never mind that it&#39;s never gone ice free as we&#39;ve predicted for over 30 YEARS! Never mind that the Antarctic was at an all time MAXIMUM in 2014. Kinda hard to have global warming without the globe warming.<br /><br />Never mind that since 1998 we&#39;ve only had 2 states set temperature records and 23 states were set in the 1930&#39;s alone.

Native Americans have used controlled forest burns for generations. But that is never mentioned. California is experiencing roillng blackouts because of too much reliance on solar & wind mill energy.

And Trump can't even read from a teleprompter without getting it wrong. As for corrupt, well I guess we won't know how he makes his money until he releases his taxes huh? Oh wait he's 4 million in debt, I guess he doesn't have any money. Maybe that's why he won't release them. Or he's hiding the money in his secret Chinese bank account.

If the best use for the world finite resources is to burn them for a moments production of energy and then its gone forever, that&#39;s extremely short sighted. Replace that use with an inexhaustible substitute, provide transitional training for the affected industries, move miners for coal and fracking to pumped hydro and Hydraulic hydro infrastructure, then export that know how to the world.

VP is an almost entirely perfunctory position -- to ask what he did as VP isn't fair, since VP's hold almost no actual political power in federal affairs, other than consultive purposes. Asking what Biden has done in 47 years is inane when you can see how much Trump has destroyed in just 4.

If we increased the carbon in the soil even just 1%, that would take care of all the excess carbon in the atmosphere. The only way to do that is through regenerative agriculture, using livestock to naturally fertilize the soil and rebuild it so it doesn&#39;t wash away in a rainstorm, so the ground is always covered with plants that build soil carbon and increase soil moisture so the rain stays where it lands instead of washing the soil away. It also creates much more nutritious and delicious food, plus makes more money for farmers. Lots of them are getting on this bandwagon and not a moment too soon.

What's the correct number of posts to make, and what sentiments should I be expressing? I would hate for Preston Garvey and other YouTube strangers to think I'm not chill. I think Biden's plans aren't that great and that he's not a particularly eloquent expositor of them. But I also thinks these are silly conversations to be having while everyone just ignores the massive evidence of his corruption. I agree with you that we should have gone the route Sweden did, but the Democrats don't...

Call it "voter fraud detection" then. Unless Joe was actually speaking off the cuff, then he is truly the moron. Let me help Joe out... "The president is implying that votes won't be counted or even that they can't be counted if people don't vote at the normal polling places and instead use vote my mail. By doing this, he is discouraging people from voting. To counter this, we've put together the most extensive voter fraud detection system in the history of American politics and we intend to use this system to challenge any and all improprities that are encountered" There you go buddy. Now it's not the ramblings if an incoherent (potential) leader of the free world. I just hope the "orange man bad" has a better system cause he's going to need it.

A preference for voting by mail does not result in a situation where 91% of ballots in a batch go for Biden--a statistically impossible windfall that completely reversed Georgia's trend and cleared a margin of victory for Biden. To add insult to injury, these ballots were literally produced from underneath the table, and counted in secret when the vote counting was officially stopped, with no Republican observers present. And it was all caught on surveillance cameras, unbeknownst to the vote counters. An investigation in the courts would've revealed the rampant fraud at play in Georgia and the other 5 battleground states, but of course, all attempts to address the fraud in the courts were thwarted on motions to dismiss, not for a lack of evidence. Now you can go back to pretending this all adds up.	UCisaU7s_W21b0k9sVq1WViw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCisaU7s_W21b0k9sVq1WViw	1	Ugw8rTgphFGwXyN0gnd4AaABAg	J. P.

Biden won the election by millions of votes actually and it is ACTUALLY stated everywhere unlike your made up claim and Trump and his ppl have not proven shit every claim they are making is being thrown out and dismissed out of courts of law. It don't make it real just cuz u ppl say its true. Judges everywhere are laughing at thes idiotic mindless claims. So time to wake up BIDEN WILL BE YOUR NEW PRESIDENT the 46th in American history that is.

Still no evidence Trump got more votes in any of those states I think its time to give it up soon for him in these states lol. I don't think they should recount any of those states imo the race is not close in those that's just me tho and I don't think they will Biden is the clear winner in those states and overall. For the record Trump is not FOR blacks either lol but ya. Michigan has plenty of ppl that would vote for Biden half the state like him and in PA hes from PA so thats even more understandable he would get votes there. Biden and Kamala and Obama together helped get Biden in the office. Looking forward to it.

Those states flipped blue now. Either way recounting in certain states won't change anything, the only ones who are not aware of this yet are republicans, trump and his base everyone else knows what's sup already. I expect Biden to be the next president mark my words. The man got 5 million more overall votes than Trump I mean enough is enough lol. But ya you wait till whatever happens happens I guess to reassure yourself but I'm telling you Biden will be president and I'm confident in that statement. It will all come down to the same conclusion, Biden and Kamala will be the new leaders in 2021.

One thing I do know tho is that BIDEN IS PRESIDENT ELECT ALREADY. They are throwing out Trump lawsuits and ppl are pretty much begging Trump to concede how much longer can keep up this denial? I'm banking on a couple more weeks cuz Biden has to get in there and start fixing his mess pretty soon here. Also If Trump wants to pass Biden 7000 votes is not gonna cut it. Biden won the popular vote by more than 5 million LEGAL votes and the electoral college as well, Trump did not beat him in either therefore he lost. Either way time will tell who came out on top Biden has got my money and all signs point to that as of now if you are a realistic person who sees both sides and not just what Trump and his ppl are spewing.

The school system is very biased and is an indoctrination tool. I have left that place unscathed thank God. I voted for Trump this year because this bullshit needs to stop. The rioting, looting, the needless protests. It's all bullshit. The only thing I have heard Good ol sleepy joe and kamala harris talk about is Covid and BLM. All of which came up this year out of no where. The masks and quarantine are an experiment to see how long the people can be controlled for. I live in New York and governor Cuomo just put out a huge new mandate saying you can't have a get together in your own house of more then 10 people. Right before Christmas time kinda funny... This is bullshit. I'm not saying the chinese virus does not exist but I will say that masks including the n95 masks do nothing. They have no purpose... So therefore all of this shit is bullshit. Notice no spikes when people were protesting. Now all of a sudden in a state where everyone was complying now we need more control... Cuomo stated that the cases are coming from gatherings at people's houses, Restaurants, and gyms. Why don't you just put us all down while you are at it. I am so sick of this country and all the kids who think they are smart. This is so stupid. Further more with a plauge or epidemic you don't quarantine people who aren't sick. This is unprecedented. There are more cases of suicide, domestic abuse, drugs, and drinking. This is because people feel locked up and stuck even more now then ever before! This needs to stop RIGHT NOW!

President Trump never said or did anything to discourage anyone from voting LEGALLY, but he has expressed concern about votes being cast by those who aren't eligible. In many areas of the country, Democrats are openly in favor of non-citizens voting, so it's not hard to figure out what Biden meant when he said "If enough people vote, it's going to overwhelm the system." He was talking about the PLAN to do that.	UCDLrq96H8ywRAgjXNSFIwew	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDLrq96H8ywRAgjXNSFIwew	1	Ugw8rTgphFGwXyN0gnd4AaABAg	J. P.

There is no proof of custody in mail in ballots it's different with absentee ballots I know some people need them. I also don't think that being afraid to go vote is a valid reason when people get gas, get groceries, go to the ATM, go to work, go to friends, house, go pick up mail, go out to eat, go protest etc if you have and can do any of these things you can go vote	UC6QnS20twO65nJCbEN0VMCg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6QnS20twO65nJCbEN0VMCg	1	Ugw8rTgphFGwXyN0gnd4AaABAg	J.

Doesn't mean they should walk around in front of a school with an A R 15. Having the right to do something doesn't mean you should. People who are not informed about policy, foreign affairs, or simply ignorant only clog up the system with over bloated vote tallies. They have no idea what they are voting for and screw things up for the rest of us. Tell me why we let kids just leaving high school with no real world experience vote? They have never paid taxes, never had a full time job, no family to support, and no meaningful wisdom to base their decision on. Why do Democrats want to lower the voting age to kids still in school? Because they want ignorant people voting for things they don't understand but sound nice. Things like free (insert false promise from every candidate on the dem ticket) nothing is free but low information voters do not understand this. If anything we should be raising the voting age not lowering it. We already live in a nation of morons and this crap only makes it worse.

In case you're wondering, infer means to deduce or conclude (something) from evidence and reasoning rather than from explicit statements. For example from this information we can infer that you can't figure something out unless someone explicitly says something or explains it to you.

Such a loving father and a lovely man. <br />My husband was born in Massachusetts and worked in California at the LA Times. We live in Tasmania Australia now (the island state of Australia 40 degrees South! Just FYI) He just spent 6 weeks trying to get re-registered and vote in LA. He first requested aN absentee ballot and waited 4 weeks then had to email the district where he used to be registered in in LA. One election official okayed his registration then another later cancelled it. He went back to the first official and they made it their mission to identify the problem and fixed it. He even had to make international calls to election officials. FYI You can’t fax your ballot from overseas apparently! So that good election official directed him to a website where he could send a pdf of his online absentee vote. Now he has to mail it tomorrow, which he will do.We celebrated when he voted straight blue down the ticket for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris! I love how boring Joe thinks he is. I found myself getting excited about how chicken manure affects climate change and regenerative farming. I think the US and the rest of the world deserves a boring President. Australian politics has been affected by Trump and Coalition forces in Afghanistan also have bounties on their heads. Please vote for Australia too. Loved this podcast! Thank you. Cheers.

Because of the resolution of your camera and the tiny movements as you talk as touch your desk, it is creating an optical illusion of movement. Can I suggest that you just put a flag or something else to cover that grill. Sorry to be so picky, but now it is all that I can see when you are on camera.

Joe doesn&#39;t have to get into the gutter to make his points defiant and above par. When you have the facts on your side there&#39;s no reason to peddle in urine journalistic hyperbole like donnie does. We all know that donnie&#39;s brew of incompetence (Ivanka, Eric and DJ) all make money off his presidency with donnie&#39;s blessings. This is against the law (emoluments clause) and donnie, the candidate of law and order, doesn&#39;t care one iota and that&#39;s why he needs to be voted out of office ASAP. We NEED a higher standard of honor and respect brought back to the highest office in the land and Joe and his wife Jill will do that. BLUE TSUNAMI 2020!!!!!

We need democracy reforms to make these things happen ( supreme court reform, ending filibuster, puerto rico dc statehood). To get these things done, democrats will have to wield power decisively. Two things I have not seen democrats do in my lifetime is wield power or be decisive.	UC9UmqUxtPQGJyxKvlomy7zQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9UmqUxtPQGJyxKvlomy7zQ	0

I love that Joe Biden apologised for getting lost in the weeds of policy details, especially in regards to climate change - it was awesome to see someone discuss such complicated issues in a way that was easy to understand. I have no idea how Trump is getting away with the &quot;sleepy joe&quot;/ &quot;joe has dementia&quot; attacks, because Joe Biden was very clear here, and answered every question well. And as someone who has also overcome a pretty bad stutter, it&#39;s inspiring to see someone else who also had a stutter run for President! Joe wouldn&#39;t have been my first choice for president (Bernie and Warren fan here), but I also like that he&#39;s running on a platform of unity, empathy and compassion; those are values and traits we need in a leader in 2020, when we&#39;ve also suffered so much collective trauma and grief.

Although I could see he was the best person to win he didn&#39;t seem to communicate a cohesive vision, which is the big picture and on some level all that really matters. But when you take the time and hear him at his most relaxed you realise he does have one and it&#39;s mapped out in his own head. You can see it when he is keen to talk at length and at his most engaged about the issues of change - ending racial injustice, climate change etc.	UCR82dCVSF-SjA024a0NYZGw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR82dCVSF-SjA024a0NYZGw	0

You don't really care about the Climate unless the issue can be used to destroy American jobs. Climate change the way you use it might as well be a Chinese Stealth Bomber destroying our factories and power plant and American worker futures. Way to go Maggie. If you really cared about Climate you and all of the treasonous Democrats would be demanding that China Clean up it's environmental policies.

Its funny how easy ppl can be fooled by not taking into account the whole context of what he is saying. People like to cut bits and pieces out here and there to make it look like he said something else, nice try but once again FAIL. Trump lost and that's it. His main message here is not to be intimidated to VOTE that is the whole point of this lol. He also encouraged ppl who could not get to polls in person to vote by mail. HIS MAIN MSG TO HIS BASE.....VOTE EARLY, which is exactly what they did. Our democracy is at stake, all true words he spoke which Trump and his ppl like to ignore, they take a part of what he said lol and cut out the rest.

If Biden gets both congressional chambers back, he’s not going to be able to get rid of fracking and fossil fuels AND build robust clean energy infrastructure with the snap of his fingers. So why ruin the livelihoods of people struggling during a pandemic? I’m all for saving the planet just like everyone else, but we need to ensure that the people who work in the fossil fuels industry are able to support themselves and don’t have the rug pulled under them. A phase out and gradual deterrence works far better, assuming we can act quickly to pass legislation.

Yeah, biden said exactly the above in this very video, in case you missed it. in case you missed it, biden has dementia, can barely function in a debate, can barely string sentences together, this is the guy you want in office? China and Russia along with India are the worst polluters on the planet, do you honestly think they will kill their economies for some lofty goal of green energy neutrality? You are clearly naïve.

Before my father passed in October of last year, he told me to do everything in my power to get Trump out of office. He also got his dream ticket of Biden/Harris. I cried my eyes out when Joe picked her. I am also taking folks who are voting blue to go vote early, my dad used to take people to vote every year before he got sick in 2019.

As an Immigrant and a Bernie supporter I was so skeptical but I am glad there was substance in this interview. TBH. All the soul of the nation platitudes do not work at all on young voters at all. And to Joe’s point about talking about “Boring” stuff NO DUDE THATS what I want to hear. Young voters overwhelmingly care about policy. So I wish he talked like this way more often he should bring this issues up alot more. Its not boring it makes me want to support him even more than hearing BS platitudes. Disappointing he won’t ban fracking but we will fight him on that when he is in the whitehouse. We have ten days to kick out the fascist and then we will have four years to relentlessy fight Joe Biden. Lets go.	UCo0EztbdCa2B12q7A2s9SnA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo0EztbdCa2B12q7A2s9SnA	0

Why did Trump win, because Obama/Dems were all talk and little action. Let&#39;s just be honest here, the Dems are weak, we need to play dirty like the Reps do. We want a Green New Deal, tax the hell out of the oil/gas companies, ram in through and raise hell to make is work. You want Medicare for all? Legislate that health insurers are illegal, confiscate their wealth and build a nationalized system.

I can like or agree with &quot;person A&quot; more than &quot;person B&quot;, but the real thing that matters is will &quot;person A&quot; or &quot;person B&quot; ultimately get more of the things i feel needs to be accomplished (whether benefitting myself, my community, country, or world as a whole) or on the road to being accomplished. And the answer to that question has been Biden right from the start. <br />As and example, take healthcare. A full public &quot;single payer&quot; type system is much better (Bernie) than a combination &quot;public option&quot; (Biden). But i realize that if Bernie was the presidential candidate it would be very likely he would not even get a chance to implement his plan, either because he would lose the election (trump base + centrist (soft) republicans (who are so scared of &quot;socialism&quot; and on this issue alone would abstain or reluctantly vote for trump) or if Bernie did win, it would be by such a small margin and the senate would have zero chance of being held by the democrats (and i mean zero!). Ultimately, the result for Bernie would be no movement at all towards a public &quot;single payer&quot; system and a huge number of people without adequate healthcare coverage. For Biden, not only would everyone be able to have adequate coverage (albeit not as good as it should or could be) but half the step to a full comprehensive plan would be achieved, the results would be real and visible to all the naysayers, and the next step will have that much more widespread support and be easier to achieve. <br />This same thing applies to much of Biden&#39;s platform. Right now the whole discussion surrounds &quot;ifs&quot; on a large scale. After four years of a Biden presidency the country as a whole can then be at a point of discussing &quot;hows&quot; on a more macro level. In other words, people can see that the sky didn&#39;t fall, cold war &quot;commies&quot; aren&#39;t coming out of the woodwork, and gramma isn&#39;t getting raped twice a month.

I actually don't think you said a single true or insightful thing besides the fact that ACB couldn't recall "petitioning for a governmental redress of grievances" during a multi-day, sans-notes performance where she made Democrat senator after Democrat senator look foolish. How has he violated the Constitution? How have his kids profited from his office? What are the different kinds of taxes Donald Trump pays? (Hint: it's not just income tax.) What's the distribution of when these sexual assaults are alleged to have occurred vs when the accusations were made? And I can't believe you swallowed the obvious lie about the so-called separated children. How many of those children's parents have been found, but refuse to have their child reunited with them in their country of origin? You should look into it. I know I didn't hit every single point you made but I have other things to do and I gave you plenty to keep busy. Enjoy.

He pays more taxes to China than the US. His children are getting rich off of his office while he accuses his opponent's son of doing the same. He's too self-absorbed to do anything about a pandemic, even after he's contracted it. If not for statutes of limitations, he would be facing jail time after he leaves office for all the sexual assault he's committed. He has turned the US into a fucking joke, when it once led the free world -- leaders literally make fun of him while he's in the room. He has encouraged white supremacists. He has nominated someone to the Supreme Court who can't even name all of the protections offered by the First Amendment. His administration can't even find 545 families that have been separated by from their children. He has turned the DOJ into his personal law firm.   He has presented exactly ZERO policy initiatives going forward and when asked what he DID accomplish, he often brings up an Obama policy. He is an idiot. I could keep going, honestly. If you're a pumpkin supporter, you're a fucking idiot, period. You should probably kill yourself and do the rest of us a favor. Policy issues are one thing, (and you're clearly wrong-headed about those) but you clearly lack a heart, soul, and mind if you would give this bloviating retard your vote.

I'm white but well-educated, but I still consider myself squarely in Trump's base, and voted for him in 2016. Washington is even more corrupt than any of us knew and watching President Trump battle the swamp has been wild. All considered, I'm happy with the progress but there's much to do. I support a secure border and immigration enforcement, I think the ACA is trash, I'm THRILLED he's pushing back against critical race theory and federal employee training programs based on it, I LOVE Amy Barrett for the Supreme Court, I support his executive orders and enforcement actions on human trafficking, I strongly support reducing government regulation, I think he's done a great job with the economy, etc. I could keep going, honestly. Joe is a corrupt career crook who has been in Washington forever. He's even been a joke forever, until Trump Derangement Syndrome changed the equation. Joe lies CONSTANTLY and is really, really cringey on race. Last time he was in power, he and his buddy Barry brought this country to its knees. Never again!!!

The oldest living former President, Jimmy Carter, put solar panels on the roof of the White House, and sounded the alarm that fossil fuels were a dead end. Much as Ike&#39;s warning about the Military Industrial Complex, it went unheeded by subsequent administrations and Congresses, and like failing to adopt the metric system, it singles us out as unwilling to learn and grow when confronting the reality of globalization the US drove to its inescapable dominance. I heartily applaud your conviction and focus on the dire place we&#39;re in 45 years later, but think there&#39;s a deeper message for GOP - Reagan&#39;s ludicrous economic travesty of trickle down folly should be underscored by his removal of those PV panels from the People&#39;s House - he was, himself, a fossil, but unlike the current impostor in Office, had passable credibility as a thespian, rather than an obvious (and oblivious,) huckster. Thank you for carrying the ball, Joe - we&#39;ve got your back, so keep your eyes and ears open, as we&#39;ll be in hyper gear soon after 11/3, with a ton to remedy and rebuild better.

Trump did not agree in Davos but Biden will. So if he wins it is simply game over. Perpetual lockdown, no airplanes, less travel, all that and they say it will reduce emissions toward their goal for 2030. 7% each year so that is 70% by 2030. In there is when many of us will die.

It's disingenuous to think that we can "cure" the environment from what ails it when there isn't even consensus about what ails it or what's causing the things that ails it. And it's pure folly to throw billions of dollars at a problem over which you have no definitive grasp. What you can do is lead people to believe that you have solutions over that which can't possibly have a solution. Trying to solve a problem that you don't know the cause to by throwing money at it is literally as effective as pissing into the wind.

I agree it&#39;s weird to be at the top of the GOP agenda list. NASA gets 0.4% of fed budget. The current plan is to land the first woman and the next man on the Moon by 2024. That date was pushed up by Trump so it would occur during his second term. If the timeline is kept it&#39;ll keep current plans moving ahead, keep the pressure on contractors to get things done on time and on budget, etc. China is rapidly developing their plans and it&#39;ll be important to have some claim to resources on the Moon. Plus SLS needs somewhere to go (or be canceled which isn&#39;t happening). NASA keeps having to change plans when new administrations come in which ends up delaying or canceling programs and costing time and money. Jim Bridenstine - who many were skeptical at his confirmation - has done a really good job and should be kept on. More focus on climate science and education should be added with additional funding. Trump, IIRC, canceled all or most of that to focus on the Moon program and for political reasons.	UC1ZKGu0LAl3X8oSc8Awdbbg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1ZKGu0LAl3X8oSc8Awdbbg	0

Regenerative Farming is about (amongst other things) soil management and sequestering carbon in land that is being used to farm livestock and crops. But yeah douche, instead of sharing knowledge and pooling ideas, or even googling the term "Regenerative Farming"; come beat your chest on the internet with an absolute bollox history lesson and show thd rest of us, yet again, why Murica can't have nice things.

Quite literally when the dust bowl happened it was because of old ignorant ways of farming of just growing a single crops over and over which lead to soil degradation and failing crops which in turn left the land barren, dead and dry which in turn covered the US in huge dust clouds. We learned out lesson then and began rotating crops with mutually beneficial crops that use and return different nutrients to the soil when they are turned over, that has since be spread world wide (for the most part) and is a common practice.

We are the worker bees who have to be out there actively engaging folks in our spheres on this issue. We are integral to continuing to shift public opinion to support what needs to be done so that President Biden and VP Harris and our Congress can get shit done in Washington.

UgwNhZdtfIvM8_KgKfZ4AaABAg.9FCF_pZGs4W9FCHdf35hc2		0	2020-10-24 15:13:51	Jill Bond	In RE to the farmers part: first off you don't have a clue what you're talking about. The point is, and what the EU does is they pay farmers to not overwork their land, to ensure that first, that will help reduce soil erosion and secondly to reduce food waste and the carbon footprint. At this point, farmers are already subsidized but its currently to mass produce mostly high water usage/tillage crops (although GM crops do reduce the need for soil turnover and thus soil erosion). This isn't kickbacks, these are measure to ensure the land that is fro food production remains viable- rotating crops that was the 'old' traditional system isn't economically feasible in a free market system anymore. T The other part he was referring to is that you put land aside for carbon capture. These are usually plants that can pull out CO2 from the atmosphere, use some of it, and store some within the soil. There may be better methods of carbon capture but if this is done on non-agricultural land (high acidic land with low quality soil), this might be possible. But the larger point of the whole interview is that he illustrated he wants to find ways to reduce the US and global carbon production. I will finish with this, the fact that he said he wants to transition away from fossil fuels is HUGE, the political consequences of such a statement could be drastic. The media jumped on that like they were starving for anything controversial so they can appear to be neutral. In Canada, when our Prime Minister said pretty much the same thing, it was a huge controversy, and we are a more left leaning society than America. I don't think you realize the guts it took to come out and say that, and to acknowledge it. Granted he still wants to allow fracking which is absolutely awful, but hopefully he can be persuaded - and that's the point here. He's not perfect but he listens and indicated he wants to increase funding to help research at universities/colleges which is vital for health and the environment.

Narcissist&#39;s, sociopath&#39;s and dictators use this method. Climate change is more than a moral obligation it is survival. Trump thinks he won&#39;t out live the crisis, who cares about planet for anyone else even his children. Can&#39;t wait for trump to be gone and I do not have to hear his effortless lying. trump took us out of Paris agreement, that not only lowered our credibility and standing in the world, deregulated poisonous gas into environment, but lost $23 million in market opportunities. That means jobs; other competing nations will take advantage of that.	UCy8qByO7HGOLgY3zuAmRl5Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy8qByO7HGOLgY3zuAmRl5Q	0

The economy is struggling to recover back to how it was because we still can't safely do the things we used to be able to do. Trump said in a Michigan rally that he plans to run for 8 more years. The crowd chanted "12 more years" Trump said 12 would be the new number. This guy is going to damage our democracy to a possibly irreparable point. Biden won't run for 3 terms. Biden won't constantly stir hatred. Pitting American against American. Trump will continue transitioning us into a country that doesn't look like America. I don't' know how else to tell you how much is at stake. This is a bipartisan issue. Trump is degrading our democracy. He's appointed a DOJ that's job is to protect the president. To say Biden didn't do enough feels like a weak argument to me when seeing how much damage Trump has done. If a president only does a little good, I would prefer that over a president that's actively trying to maintain his power at all costs.

"I've accomplished more in 47 months..." and "Biden doesn't know where he is, he just reads off a teleprompter." Where is your evidence of either claim? No one who actually watched this interview believes that he was reading his answers, that conspiracy falls apart on observation. And here is a compilation of Biden's accomplishments: https://www.newsweek.com/joe-biden-achieved-40-years-politics-1541278 Here is data that demonstrates that the economy has performed better under Democratic administrations for several decades, while Republicans have caused recessions: http://presidentialdata.org/ In fact, we entered another recession in February of this year, which cannot be blamed on Covid-19. The "booming economy" was unsustainable because the enormous tax breaks for the wealthy and corporations resulted in more stock buy-backs than job creation. The un-winnable trade wars and short-sighted policies that lined the pockets of the richest Americans juiced the stock market, but the Fed had already reached its limit and could not continue to lower rates despite constant Twitter threats from President Trump. What were Trump's big promises in 2016?

It's all just talking points being read off a teleprompter. Half the time he doesn't even realize what it is he's talking about because he's reading to us, not having a conversation with us. This is the point at which they tell you what they think you want to hear. A debate gives you insight into their actual thought process, or lack thereof, and forces them to also counter the opposing narrative. It allows us to see how well they know their own bs and whether or not that BS can stand up to any scrutiny under an opposing narrative. This is all just pure BS. Just a guy telling you what you want to hear and voters have been falling for it from him for 47 years now. Other than the Crime Bill, what has he actually accomplished in 47 years in the actual position to make policies and laws to fix all of the issues he proposes that he can now fix as President. Hell, he even had two full years as VP with a veto proof congress where literally anything they wanted to get done could have been pushed through without the need for a single Republican vote. And what did they squander those entire two years on? Not fixing Social Security, not immigration reform, not protecting the DACA kids, not prison reform, not tax reform, not eliminating terrorism, etc. Instead, they focused on overhauling the entire health care system, kicking 20 million people off of insurance plans that they actually liked and almost collapsing 1/6 of the economy in the process. What does Joe have to show for 47 years of policy making? Putting millions of black men into prison for sh*t he makes sure that his own son gets away with. I'm sorry but Biden has had 47 years of chances to make a difference. Believing that now he can actually deliver on anything is pure folly. People need to stop being so predictably gullible.

Even the town hall was better than the first and (third?) because you could just hear him explain his plans. This was probably even better though as it's a more comfortable setting.

That is not stuttering because he's brain is going too fast, it is his brain failing like an old electrical grid. There is a clear difference with his kind of stutter and Elon´s Musk stutter for example. Not sure how the hell the OP came to that conclusion, I guess his brain is failing as well. You didn't hear about Joe doing anything useful for his 40+ years working in the Government but somehow you are saying he thinks too fast, lol.. not unexpected from the type of people that would vote for Joe.

I was trying to point out that he's still affected by his stutter, but that does not in any way diminish the value of what he has to say or his intelligence; it only means it's more difficult for him to get the words out.

It's very empowering to see Biden running for President and be able to make it this far politically. If Mr. Biden is fortunate to win in a couple of weeks, he would be the 2nd PWS to win the presidency. The first one was Thomas Jefferson. Believe it or not, he would avoid making public speeches and would talk to people with a low pitch voice, trying not to reveal his disability. In the age of debates, 24-hour media, it's very refreshing to see somebody with a speech dis-fluency, potentially being our next President. Such progression as a country. A country that is more inclusive and open to others is a country, I want to live in.

It is only managed with proper speech therapy and intense focus. Most stutterers as they get older, find methods to disguise the stutter. Biden exhibits secondary stuttering, as in lots of pauses and using word substitution when they cannot pronounce a word or phase. When people say they "use to stutter", they really mean, they have found ways to manage it for the most part.

That seriously applies here. There's a difference between accidentally using the wrong word and losing the substance of the conversation by not having any cogent points. Biden occasionally trips over words or flubs up and gives a wrong statistic. However, the broader point he's trying to make usually shines through and is based on evidence. Trump, meanwhile, likes to go off on self-aggrandizing tangents that have no basis in fact and makes suggestions that even a child could see are completely moronic. He occasionally flubs words too, but it's his incurious nature and utter narcissism that shine through the most when he speaks.

But the path we are taking to move away from fossil fuels is generating activity and outcomes that are more damaging that the initial problem; partly because we are implementing immature technology that is not as far down the development curve as it needs to be. When the cure is worse than the disease then you need to stop taking the medicine; particularly when the medicine does not even offer a cure in the long term, as in this instance. Do you appreciate the amount of damage done extracting and processing exotic metals for batteries and electric motors?; metals such as lithium and rare earths. The extraction is bad enough but the processing is immensely polluting. Refining rare earths involves cracking acids and in some instances 30 days of harsh acid refinement with many cycles. Please look it up and educate yourself. And then we have the fact that we could not possibly generate the electricity required using renewables and if we did the vast majority of the planets surface would have to be covered in wind turbines and solar panels; nuclear is the only feasible way to do it if you want to exclude fossil fuels. And each wind turbine and solar panel comes at a massive cost in terms of the materials required, the processing energy and the pollution/damage caused as a result. You realise that only something like 5% of energy is delivered as electricity as we stand....95% of it is delivered as oil (cars, planes, lorries, buses etc) or gas (household/commercial heating, industrial energy etc). Hence the electricity grid only supports 5% of current energy usage....imagine what has to be done to support all the other uses of energy if they were all delivered as electricity and the amount of additional cabling required. Like I said previously....this is either all political posturing or sheer naivety as it is not credible. I have worked in the industry for 15 years so I know.

Both from the extraction and the processing. Whilst you think you are saving the planet you are in reality doing exactly the opposite. Look up lithium extraction and see how much damage that causes and the moonscapes that are left as a result. And that is for the production of an amount which is probably 1000th if what would be required in the longer term. It is not sustainable.

His comments about a small battery pack powering a house for a week is uninformed. Maybe just the fridge and a few led lights, but not a typical household.

Oil derivatives are used in just about everything that we produce and are used in the production of just about everything else. Look around you and find something plastic....it will undoubtedly have a oil derivative in it....a polymer produced as a by product of the oil industry. The notion of everybody driving electric cars is also ridiculous.....there would never be enough electricity produced from renewables and the exotic metals used in batteries and motors are causing far more damage to the planet than fossil fuels ever did. I'm afraid you are all being led down a blind alley.	UCfQkFDkzdjXFyq3GU2-naZA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfQkFDkzdjXFyq3GU2-naZA	1	UgzhI8CwSNZnfdq0r3F4AaABAg	Brice A

They are continuously shocked by patterns of behavior that are repeatedly blatantly foreshadowed, present false equivalency on an astronomical scale. It is frustrating in the extreme. We can only hope that the prevalence of alternative sources that they keep bleeding viewers to will wake them up to reality.

Our skin tones are thus varied, as a collective as Africans, we ALL see each other as Africans, both culturally and linguistically.

We dont have the technology to store huge capacity of electrical energy... look at your mobile phone and the battery. Look at the size of the battery and the size of the mobile phone. Where do you get the batteries for cities for million of citizien. Almost all the electricity we produce get used up right away. We use huge waterdamms to store energy. There is no damn solution to replace fossils compleatly. We can only reduce it and dont let anyone(EXPACIALLY A POLITIAN) tell you he has a solution. Nuclear plants dont produce any carbon... thats a start. Fusion reactors would be a solution, but we are stuck there for 80+ years. BTW wind, sun and water are all not enviroment friendly. They dont produce carbon. Big difference. As example solar panels get used up and they are mainly toxic trash afterwards and not to mention the amount of space they need. But to be honest the influence humanity have on global warming is a small factor(still a factor). There are also some good things about global warming. We have an increased 30% crop harvest and there will be no water shortage(remember the big fearmongering about wars about water in 2050 blahblah) Everything get used to gain power nowadays and blown out of proportion. As example there was a volcano breakout: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_winter 1883 one created a winter for 16 month straight worldwide. And we heat up the planet by 2°~ and its the biggest world threating event ever. We have to work to decrease our output, but the fearmongering is retarded. If we could really terraform the planet... we would already started to colonize mars. One step at a time.

We also need to push geothermal - I would <b>love</b> to have our home converted to geothermal heating.. There&#39;s a company in NY (Dandelion) that implements it in existing homes... we need to subsidize that technology even more than we subsidize fossil fuel. Rejoin the paris accord and the WHO and remove any stipulations that the US can &quot;opt&quot; out. We&#39;re in the same world.. we can&#39;t <i>opt out</i><br /><br />Race relations has to be discussed.. serious sit downs with multiple communities.. to come up with ideas to make it better. We have to think outside the box because inside the box 👏isn&#39;t 👏working.<br /><br />Go back to decreasing nuclear weapons. As much as you can. It needs to go... there&#39;s no sense in having weapons that are going to blow up the world 50x over.<br /><br />World relations -- we need to repair our relations with our allies and build bridges, not walls. Immigrants should get help in being productive members of our patchwork nation. Teach them english and help them. But don&#39;t just help <b>them*.. help *us</b> too with education and job opportunities for those that want it... bring more teachers in.. for the children <b>and</b> adults.<br /><br />We need to do everything we can to make the <b>world</b> a better place.. not just in the US. <br /><br />Mr Biden.. you have to do <i>so much better</i> <b>for everyone</b> . Not just better than Trump... but better than Obama... so that future presidents can reference <b>your</b> accomplishments.

Joe&#39;s visions give me hope, I only wish he hadn&#39;t said &#39;Bidencare&#39; at one point. Seeing countless people asked &quot;Do you support the ACA = yes, and how do you feel about Obamacare? =Hate it&quot; would strongly suggest that no matter how well-meaning or beneficial any policy is, it becomes unnecessarily divisive with a candidate&#39;s name attached. I&#39;m pleased Joe stressed repeatedly that he will be &#39;America&#39;s President&#39; not just a Democrat, so the &#39;Bidencare&#39; mention felt like a mis-step. As many faults as there are with our National Health Service, it isn&#39;t viewed as political itself - although closures, funding, staff wages etc do clearly become politicised by either party. The notion of healthcare as a right for everyone remains in a neutral space and I hope you guys can achieve this too.

With the way that Joe wants to be an American president for all people (not just Democrats) I think keeping the name neutral is more in alignment with how he plans to govern. Hopefully his administration will hear our advice.	UCpG7uqakYukcv_ljd9ew-jQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpG7uqakYukcv_ljd9ew-jQ	1	UgzmQvFL-B_742fDIwZ4AaABAg	Yzola Kitchi

They confirmed that Joe was in on the pay-for-play scheme. They both produced their emails, documents and even access to their email accounts. The Biden's have been selling influence for decades. First with Joe's brothers and then with Hunter when he grew up. Hunter has been in rehab 7 times - because Joe forced him to work with the most corrupt and evil oligarchs on the planet. Look up the pictures of Joe Biden kissing his granddaughters on the mouth - multiple times. Hunter was screwing his dead brothers wife......and soon you'll learn what he was doing with his dead brother's daughter.

Yes, we live in a Capitslist society, where a profit motive makes networks competitive for engagement; that doesn't mean journalists are primarily motivated by money. Political pundits and opinion hosts like Sean Hannity--who makes $35M/year to help elect Republicans--are a different story. There are grifters who are financially backed by people like Dennis Prager, but those people are not journalists.

It&#39;s pretty hard to find others as professional as Kyle Kulinski, Hill Rising, Jimmy Dore and others. That actually want to vote Trump out. <br /><br />I&#39;m livid with anti-Biden progressives for not wanting to vote Trump out. Biden is flawed. He&#39;s done many things I disagree with. Stuff that&#39;s even hurt my community.<br /><br />However to compare him to Trump. Or even make the claim he&#39;s worse is utterly ridiculous. I want to give him another chance. I really hope he&#39;s elected. <br /><br />Because the further Trumps America goes right towards facism. The more my family and I feel like Jews in Nazi Germany.

I'm going to assume here that "The One who created us" is some type of deity, such as God. When has any deity been proven to exist? When have they been proven not to exist? If we can't know when the Earth was created because we didn't here it from a possible fairytale then you can't say you are basing it on fact. They also never said that the number they presented was how old the world is, even if it was implied. Secondly, your paragraph on Covid 19 is interesting as many people have said that masks are to protect others and not yourself, social distancing can be used by one person but someone who doesn't will, despite all of the evidence showing them as an idiot, still walk around like everything is normal. In your words "do not let facts or common sense affect your great ability to think" Also, do you really believe that these governments have the coordination to agree to basically ruin the economy and pretend it's because of a pandemic. If you think they could do this then I ask you why? Why would they make up a pandemic?

If the weather people cannot accurately forecast more than 48 hours based on "sophisticated scientific models" (cough cough); do you believe the climatologist will take a 1000 more factors and come up with anything other than a guess? Have you ever read a climate paper and see the phrase "scientists think" or scientist believe" or "scientists agree", which means they do not know and science means "knowledge". How many times how their models failed? many How many times have they been caught fudging? many You have a faith I cannot begin to touch. If the oceans warm because of the sun, then we get more cloud coverage due to condensation and when that increases overtime the climate goes through a cooling and therefore the water cools and less clouds form and the cycle repeats itself and that is what the actual evidence. -- How do you know how old the earth is? You do not because the One who made has never revealed that to you. Even the "experts" with those models and various dating methods cannot agree? They date the rocks by rock layers and the rock layers by the rocks - circular. Carbon14 dating they dated Mt St. Helens newly formed canyons between 10k-50k years and they formed in 1980. The ice cores are another proven lie, but I won't get into that story now - talking to someone who listens to so-called experts as a consensus, another flag where you know they are lying to you. The solution to their fear-porn is to give them money and give up your liberty and they NEVER lead by example. If your parents raised you in such a manner you would never trust them - see how ignorant you are? But liberal and unregenerate people are lazy thinkers and blindly accept anything one says with a few letters behind it and yet others with the same letters will contradict and be silenced because it goes against the agenda. I'll bet you believe Trump colluded with Russia and stole the 2016 election because the experts and Media told you so while the actual evidence is the DNC and Hillary Clinton using Fusion GPS all conspired to overthrow a duly elected President, which is treason. That is factual, but facts do not matter to you because you believe you are a thinker when you refuse to think for yourself. I'll bet you believe there is a pandemic or that a mask can help you. I'll bet you would not believe that 50% and greater of the "COVID cases" are from people who religiously wear their muzzles and practice social distancing. Again do not let facts or common sense affect your great ability to think. Why does Barack Obama and Al Gore buy expensive real estate properties Oceanside when they sell you knuckleheads on the idea that in 12 years the sea levels will rise? Show me a country that does not utilize fossil fuels and I'll show you a country without liberty in the 3rd world. You just keep living in irrational fear, the prison of the mind. Liberals are the most miserable people - I really feel sorry for you people and just wish you would let people live and pursue their own dreams their own way.

What happens when the cloud cover begins to dominate? The oceans begin to cool because of less solar penetration. The earth was made with precision by the one who created it, the same who created you and has blessed you. -- Consensus science in the 70's and 80's was fear-mongering of mini ice age, then it did not sell or happen - so 80's and 90's they tried global warming and decided to classify C02 as a green house gas, which it is and is necessary for most plants - trees love it and give back oxygen. Then the alarmist by beach front properties that they say will be under water. None of that worked, so we will just say "climate-change" because everyone agrees that there are 4 seasons - who can argue. And the solutions are the same - give us you money and give up your liberties and we will make it better. -- The stupidity of your minds and lack of any vestige of common sense is truly fascinating to observe - sad as it is.

The issue with what you are saying is something that Bernie realized but you are missing. In order to win the election the dems cannot have a far left candidate. The population has not moved that far left yet. So you do what they have decided to do. You put in someone that has a chance of winning and give Bernie and or Elizabeth cabinet positions and the ability to move that forward. Then hope the population continues to move left. The rule of thumb in any team is that everyone should aim to get 80% of what they want. Baby steps. You continue to build one step at a time.

Also, I absolutely LOVE Amy Barrett. She won't just be a fantastic SCOTUS justice, she's also a great role model for young women, and a STRONG chess move in the culture wars.

Have you ever dealt with a person with antisocial personality or narcissistic personality disorder before? They can sometimes be charming but there is no empathy, no conscience and a staggering capacity to lie and manipulate. Look at the criteria in the DSM and see if it reminds you of anyone.

Trump’s playbook is a lot of smoke to cast doubt and confusion. He repeats a lie over and over. A normal person doesn’t do this. A sociopathic malignant narcissist does. As far as packing the court, that whole notion is a concern because you don’t want a partisan court without balance, but thanks to Trump and McConnell that’s exactly what we’ve got. McConnell purposeful reduced the court a full 14 months, wouldn’t have hearings on Obama’s pick (which was an act of civility with a moderate centrist justice, Garland), and every single Trump appointee has had some irregularity, and definitely purposefully done whatever it took to tilt the court far right. The GOP has tainted the process in their partisan hypocrisy with recent nominee . I doubt Biden would do anything. Democrats always play nice and then get beat up by GOP playing hardball. Personally, I would look long and hard and I’d at least consider bringing balance or “unpacking” the court. If Democrats considered adding justices to bring balance they wouldn’t add justices to outnumber Republicans. I actually wish they would. You can’t play by the same rules you’ve always played by when the other team has gone rogue. They’re not asking me though.. lol	UCuqdPws-u_8_Aa-rIUchoYA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuqdPws-u_8_Aa-rIUchoYA	1	UgwyzBlm3Qbm46o8eap4AaABAg	Angela Ramsey Robinson

When you have a crisis - like a person is dying- you have to stop the hemorrhaging first. All other treatment follows that and if you don’t do that, nothing else matters. I’ve got international friends, so I’m assuming the metaphor isn’t familiar. As far as why Trump is a crisis to our country, I can’t list all the reasons. I’d refer anyone to the McSweeney list. Just google it. “Lest we forget the horrors: A catalog of Trump’s worst cruelties, collisions, corruptions and crimes.” Looks like it’s up to 944 so far..

Obviously, there’s an enormous amount of conspiracy theories, misinformation, and projection, that make it confusing for many, but your statement is so flipped from reality, it’s hard to even address. It’s unfortunate. I’m not being condescending. I know many friends and family that have been conned. As a therapist, I called out Trump in 2015 for his narcissistic, sociopathic behavior when there was an entire field of Republicans running. Trump has a long history of lying, corruption, brazen manipulation and is absolutely criminal. It’s kind of fascinating. The level of projection is staggering. If you understand that when he criticizes Biden or most anyone, he’s really revealing himself you get a better sense of what’s up. The fact that he has a secret bank account in a China, owes over 400 million to who knows who, and hasn’t paid hardly any taxes in the US, should be concerning enough, not counting calling military veterans “losers”, telling Bob Woodward on audio that he knew exactly how deadly COVID was prior to telling the American people it was a Democratic hoax, and no big deal, and creating deliberate division and chaos in the country (because it serves him and he doesn’t care about anyone else) while causing increased COVID cases in every county he’s held rallies recently, costing thousands of lives unnecessarily. I am more progressive, so Biden wasn’t my first choice, but the choice between the two is a no-brainer. You can judge the character between the two men easily if you just watch and listen and detox from Q-anon, Fox, etc. I’m not entirely sure how we ended up in alternate universes but I do know Trump has caused tremendous damage and Biden is capable of empathy which is a pretty critical trait. If you have a con in power that has no conscience, it’s flat out dangerous. The fact that Trump won’t guarantee a peaceful transfer of power if he loses is shocking and should cause any other concerns to pale in contrast, Nothing else matters if our democracy and freedoms are at stake.

I hate the polished turd that's always brought out that it "allowed millions of people access to healthcare for the first time in their lives." Health care and health insurance are not synonymous. It may be accurate to say that it allowed them access to health insurance, but no one was denied access to health care prior to Obamacare, so in that respect it had no effect. The same number of people have access to health care now as had access to health care pre-Obamacare. As for providing millions with access to health insurance who didn't have access before, either because of pre-existing conditions, employers who didn't offer health insurance, or because of costs, Obamacare didn't actually insure any more people. It merely traded one set of people to insure for another. it is estimated that approx. 20 million "new" people got access to health insurance through Obamacare but it is also estimated that approx. 20 million people lost their private health insurance we were all promised would not be affected. I liked my doctor and I liked my plan prior to Obamacare. I now have neither of them. What I do have is substandard insurance that I'm forced to buy for the privilege of never actually getting to see the same doctor twice and paying through the nose for virtually everything that my insurance plan covered fully prior to Obamacare.

It eliminated lifetime caps (which is a big deal because a lifetime cap of a $1M is not a lot of money if you are diagnosed with a lifetime ailment that requires expensive treatments). It allowed for covering young adults on their parents health insurance place up to the age of 27. The idea that Biden could singlehandedly effect change in 47 years of government is unfair. He was ONE Senator out of 100. A Senator that was in the minority most of the time as the Republicans have had the majority most of the time. The VP can only do but so much as what he does is dependent on the President's (Obama in his case) agenda regardless of what he personally may have wanted to do. What has Trump done? He has spent his entire first term overturning and undoing everything good that Obama did for no other reason than to be spiteful. Trump is trying to get the ACA struck down first with no real plan to replace it which will leave millions uninsured in the meantime. Trump is unfit for office. Biden isn't perfect, but NO human is perfect. There is no way anyone agrees with anyone 100% on everything, let alone millions of people agreeing on everything. The way I see it, America has been shot and is bleeding out. Our first priority as Americans as a doctor would is to STOP the bleeding. Biden to me is the clamp to stop the bleeding artery in order to stabilize the country and prepare for surgery to repair the damages done. We can agree to disagree on the details of a policy later, but we must stop the hemorrhaging first and that means voting OUT Trump and his enablers and voting IN Biden.

In fact, got one of them to vote for the first time ever this year. :D I was driving her around on Super Tuesday because doctor wasn't letting her drive for a while due to health problems. The only errand I'd set for myself that day was going to vote, and I mentioned it and why I thought it was important. Well, she hadn't voted before, but she had apparently registered when she got her driver license and was as sick of what's been going on as I've been. I helped her look up her precinct and we were pleased to see that our county let us vote at any polling place. We swung by mine. In and out in 5 minutes. She was shocked at how easy it was. Well, she's moved since then and is now in Dallas, but she made sure to register and sent me a pic of her own sticker in response to my "I Voted" selfie the day I finally got to vote in the general. All that to say, that's at least one new vote that went to Biden and the Dems in the state of Texas.

You people are clueless, the evidence on hunter biden's laptop proves that the biden family is corrupt and has been bought by the Russians and the Chinese.

When you have a bunch of billionaires / trillionaires taking over the government as it has been going on for about a century, it is not an issue? I tis obvious that the government is not in control when it is sinking in debt with the bankers and using tax payer money to pay their interest rates. By the way it is not called a conspiracy, it is called corruption, CNN just renamed in on the 60s to teach you not to pay attention and disrupt their agendas. Of course biden doesn´t focus on conspiracies, since he is just a puppet of the democrats which are in turn puppets of the bankers.

I also think the black university he bailed out and saved from closing would disagree with you. I also think the numerous black woman and men in high level positions within his companies would disagree with you (I know two of them). But I’m sure you will have some rebuttal that downplays those things. Trump isn’t perfect; far from it!!! But Joe Biden is personally behind a bill that put an alarming number of black men in prison and KEPT them there for extended periods of time. That’s not my opinion; it’s a cold hard public fact. When he said “poor (black and brown) kids are just as smart as white kids” nobody said boo. Really??? He also said “I was able to stay safe at home during COVID because black women were out there stocking the shelves of supermarkets.” REALLY??? You know how offensive that is to me as a man of color??? But I know that folks like you “love black people” so long as they vote for your guy. Otherwise, they are the devil and have been brainwashed. God forbid a black man doesn’t think the way you TELL them they should think.

We are the ones who have to transform from Adam into Jesus. We are the ones who have to make our exodus from Egypt(lower nature) and Babylon (society) the 12 disciples are the 12 astrological signs and describe phases of awakening through the 12 signs- Judah being Scorpio, the kiss of death before the Sun (Jesus) does for 3 days to be reborn. They lie to us b/c they don’t want us to know that we have direct contact with God atall times, they have cut us off from our spiritual power and soul connection to God, ourselves, and eachother. It’s the only way to control us. B/c if we fully realized “I and the father are one” and that every time you help another being your helping Jesus, we would be too powerful. Jesus said all who follow him will do works like his and greater. This is where humanity is heading in the Age of Aquarius. The 7 seals of revelation are the 7 spiritual centers in man/chakras. The 4 horsemen correspond to the 4 elements/spiritual states in which man lives in and must grow into - physical being the one we are born into - (pale horse-death) the red horse is emotions(water) which must be transmuted into higher emotions of love, the black horse is logic/air, which man can’t survive on logic left brain thinking alone like we’ve been trained to do in school. And finally the white horse is the spiritual man, reborn as Jesus. Everything corresponds to something within your own experience that you can interface with yourself! It’s so amazing... look up emmet fox 4 horsemen reality revolution. Earth is ascending into higher dimensions and Brian Scott’s channel “reality revolution” talks extensively about it. So do the Mayans and indians from other times had stories about this time when greater light would start pouring into the world. This is an amazing time to be alive!

It's a metaphysical rule. Biden admits to committing voter fraud! People are already so used to him talking demented nonsense that such a statement is reflexively put into that category, but one has to review each case individually. In this case, he speaks particularly carefully and concentrated and does not correct himself. That was not a slip-up like others, that was meant exactly as he said it. They are dark occultists, they have to publicly reveal what they are doing to avoid the karmic back-lash of their frauds. They are stealing the election and they are admitting it!

Did God create good and evil to entertain himself? Satan was allowed to trick Adam and Eve so we are all cursed and the only way to heaven or being saved is believing that God sent himself to be sacrificed because he made a mistake? I believe there needs to be a balance of good and evil so that would mean God is neutral as he made all his creation. So confusing. I still choose the good side and have to prepare for what is coming. I don't believe in doing as thy wilt and glorifying sin. But some people are all about that. Repenting 100 times a day doesn't make sense at all either. A hot girl walks by and instincts kick in. "sorry Jesus i repent for admiring her body". smh	UCjlkGNKT1s-_qlfCRtXDLrw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjlkGNKT1s-_qlfCRtXDLrw	1	Ugwtw_k5i0ySuZEEpid4AaABAg	imovergettinold

What gets me is that the "elites" worship satan/lucifer, enki, molech and do all these horrible things. they interact with entities and get power from it. That is what makes me think there is an opposing force to that evil. My brother is totally Christian and has been in Malaysia the last couple years still able to work for a huge company but is really a mission trip with his family. I find it hard to believe in something without any communication or signs. My brother says to just have faith and thinks every single word in the Bible is exact. I think its been altered but has many truths in it.	UCjlkGNKT1s-_qlfCRtXDLrw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjlkGNKT1s-_qlfCRtXDLrw	1	Ugwtw_k5i0ySuZEEpid4AaABAg	imovergettinold

After a crisis of faith I realized that there's nobody there to hear or answer prayers. Unfortunately, most people lose all of their ethics and morals in dealing with other humans unless there is a threat of damnation hanging over their heads. A generation that thinks that they have the "right" to murder an unborn human being is a generation I cannot identify with. And it is a small step from murdering unborn human beings to commit atrocities against born ones. This humanity is quite hopeless, imo.

Genuine is not the word I would describe any politician what I would label all politicians as are crony liars who sway people with beautiful words they want to hear. Also what I know about 1994 crime bill and him doing nothing politics for 47 years. What makes you think he can change something now also when ever you hear that about yourself at a job work much harder and improve your work quality cause you may be lacking. I have had that experience and I overcame it and became much better at my job. Also in my opinion Joe Biden and old time Democrats and Republicans are why we have so many problems today. Also I have a question was Trump a politician at all until he saw something that he wanted change something putting even his money on the line to make an impact on the world.
