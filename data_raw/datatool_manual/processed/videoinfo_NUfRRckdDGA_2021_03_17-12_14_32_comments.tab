To them they will label me everything from being on meds , my political party they will attack . They will threaten me , insult me , label me an uneducated bla bla bla but they refuse to give me a rational answer to this. If they base there case for climate change on scientific data then how can it be valid when they don't include the world wide 24/7 use of weather modification how can they claim the climate is changing when scientist and private companies stake claims on weather systems ? State and county pay these geo engineer's to push these weather systems over water sheds then use silver iodine to dump the water into these water sheds so they can use the water for hydro electric and sell the customers the water. Not only does that leave farmers who rely first on rain to water crops .especially small farmers but there is a whole list of other problems it creates. Then there is the solar radiation management who intentionally try and block sunlight by ionizing the atmosphere or by releasing aerosols into the atmosphere that in turn creates water vapor (water vapor is the strongest of all green house gases) and I won't get into the increase in U/v light it causes. There is to many types of weather modification to list and evidence of it I can submit if you dont believe me. But how valid is their data when weather modification is taking place world wide?

They told us that it was like an ice skater who pulls their arms in close to the body and they spin faster. That was the only point I was making is if we are losing ice at alarming rates why is the earth breaking all time records for spin rate. Wouldn't the planet be slowing down ?

(The ice caps have an impressive height but it is not the Himalaya). The amount melted right now would not prompt such effects anyway. The problem is that you get at a point of no return, the melting itself of ALL the ice would take a a few hundred years. Bad enough to raise sea levels within a few decades and different weather patterns, the fresh water affecting ocean currents etc. - and it does not matter what humans do then, it cannot be stopped.

Oh and those climate refugees arent coming from Sweden. Maybe reparations can be rolled into a government initiative to end the job gaps between unemployed blacks and whites. Like instead of straight reparations and cash, maybe some kind of energy plan. Pretending racism and exploitation arent linked and we can solve everything one at a time like a deranged Easter bunny.

But without working to fix climate change, there won't be much of a country left to worry about how racist it is. Also, as more areas of the US get destroyed, farmland fails, disease spread, resources dwindle... and people start fighting each other to survive... I'm pretty sure that's going to bring racists out of the woodwork. White folks who will try to make black people slaves again, and refuse to give them their fair share of the resources. So it's most definitely a massive issue that needs immediate attention.	UC7LgDOjWYusQpZf4lTwy0zQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7LgDOjWYusQpZf4lTwy0zQ	1	UgwQeoN4GdfvL3ViTa94AaABAg	infomationiskey

They're trading water rights on the stock exchange! Which do you want more? Air and water, or trying to get racists to treat you better, which we cannot legislate? I thought we took care of that when I was a kid, and look how far we haven't come.
