If so , then how can you leave that asymmetry , quantified by Newton's Law of Gravity , out of your EQUATIONLESS GHG paradigm ? Particularly when it has been shown by a number of people to QUANTITATIVELY explain overall planetary atmospheric temperature profiles whatever their composition . Show us your computation for Venus whose surface temperature is ~ 2.25 times that of a gray ball in orbit next to it . ( energy density ~ 25 times what the Sun delivers to its orbit . ) You can't do it . You have no equations for the progressive trapping of thermal energy beyond radiative equilibrium .

Have you been reading that "Principia Scientific" disinformation site? Big mistake! If gravitational compression caused the lapse rate, then why do you suppose the lapse rate varies so dramatically with humidity? If gravitational compression caused the lapse rate, then what explains the fact that the lapse rate varies considerably from one location to another (even though gravity and air pressure do not)? Compressing a gas does cause it to heat up ‚Äî for a little while. If you pump up your tire with air, the tire (and the air compressor) will heat up. But if you leave your car overnight, by morning the tire, and the air in it, will be as cold as the rest of the car and driveway. The Earth's atmosphere has "pumped up to" its current pressure for much, much longer than that. If gravitational compression caused the lapse rate, then why do you suppose the lapse rate goes positive in the troposphere, then negative in the stratosphere, then positive in the mesosphere, then negative in the thermosphere, with increasing altitude / decreasing pressure? How could gravitational compression cause a temperature profile like this? http://tornado.sfsu.edu/geosciences/classes/m201/Atmosphere/LapseRate.jpg	UC7SuPFd0W50tfE-zpVFz5cw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7SuPFd0W50tfE-zpVFz5cw	1	UggrOsbUKPWWM3gCoAEC	macronencer

Gases other than CO2 are even more reflective of trapped heat, such as methane, CH4 which comes from swamps and decaying matter and much from cows and other animals which have been steadily increasing and have the result of reducing the forests that previously were able to absorb much of the CO2. We are well set on the road to self destruction! Eat chickens not beef, sheep, goats, etc, because the chickens need much less land that the cows, per unit of edible mass and are less ruminating and passing out methane from their digestive systems.

Uggb4emOqwhV0HgCoAEC.8ODS9sjXaCA8ytUjKf3ezr		0	2019-08-21 09:49:42	Cedders001	Because the atmosphere is becoming more opaque to infra-red, the parts that actually successfully radiate to space are actually higher in the atmosphere. This is the notional 'top of atmosphere' which is at the Earth's 'effective temperature', around 255 K. The temperature gradient (technically called the 'lapse rate') stays about the same - the atmosphere cools by about 6 K per km vertically. Therefore the surface and lower atmosphere warm. https://youtu.be/CqjbTMz5Hro (Another, possibly simpler but less technically accurate, way of answering that question is to think about why the surface gets hotter. The surface receives energy from solar radiation and has to shed that as infra-red to stay the same temperature, as in the video. That is, the temperature of the surface will be the equilibrium temperature, where the incoming solar radiation matches the net infra-red emission. Because with more greenhouse gases it's more difficult to radiate successfully all the way to space without those infra-red rays being absorbed, the surface has to get hotter. Only that way does enough emitted radiation get through the thicker blanket of greenhouse gases. http://www.howglobalwarmingworks.org/35-words.html As scientists calculated in the nineteenth century, without any greenhouse effect, the average temperature of the Earth couldn't be warmer than -18 ¬∞C or zero ¬∞F) The second law of thermodynamics states that entropy increases, or simplified as 'heat cannot of itself pass from one body to a hotter body': https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnbiVw_1FNs Entropy of course increases because the energy from a small number of localised light photons from the sun is converted by the Earth into a larger number of scattered infra-red photons. And net heat passes from the Sun to the Earth's surface, then to the atmosphere, then to space. Don't misread the second law as meaning the colder atmosphere cannot emit heat radiation down to the ground - it must do, or all nights would be well below freezing. It's just that more heat is radiated from the surface to the atmosphere than vice versa. The sun sends light and infrared energy in the direction of the star Rigel A, even though Rigel is hotter. So not quite sure what you're asking about ignoring the second law. If you follow physical law, such as equations for radiation or conduction, the second law emerges necessarily as a statistical property. You don't need to consider it when, for example, building bridges or even designing a heat pump. Turns out that the idea that the greenhouse effect (which no scientist disputes) somehow violates the second law of thermodynamics is a common myth brought up in confusions about climate change. Explaining in different words, in basic and intermediate versions: http://sks.to/thermo The greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are like a blanket or coat that keeps you warmer even though it's not itself a source of heat. (The means of heat transfer from the Earth is radiation, because of course convection and conduction don't apply in space. Loss of heat from your body is more likely conduction. But otherwise the analogy is good.) The more interesting and important question of course it what we're going to do about it.

UgjNSgsmQgOnJHgCoAEC.7-H0Z7-4b-38sBCtle0cAy		0	2019-03-07 16:39:39	Aqualyra	@SGlitz Back in the 80's when they were trying to name this stuff, there was a push by environmentalists to call what climate scientists called climate change "global warming" because many felt that the concept was too technical and complex for the average person to understand - that the planetary average temperature would exceed the safe window between enough heat and not enough heat which would throw the planet's climate into chaos due to an excess of energy, leading to very intense weather systems; depending on where someone was on the planet this would produce weather that was too damn much: too hot, or too cold, too windy, storms much larger and more intense, for starters. The environmentalists and some scientists wanted the term "climate change" dumbed down for Joe average. As a quite young student aiming for a career in science but very interested in environmetalism I recall being dubious about this, thinking it would backfire because people would think it meant that the weather in various places would be too warm all over the planet, rather than that the planet ITSELF was 1 degree warmer ((give or take) on average. I heard other people making the same argument. And here we are!	UCqpsAR2hsTnJc-S43kA_uTw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqpsAR2hsTnJc-S43kA_uTw	1	UgjNSgsmQgOnJHgCoAEC	SGlitz

The big 2015-2016 El Nino put an end to "The Pause" in global warming. It is still clear that the rate of warming has slowed, however. Climate activists often use various tricks to exaggerate global warming. One common trick is to cherry-pick a starting point for their regressions *_between_* the 1997-1998 El Ni√±o and the 1999-2000 La Ni√±a. If you start your regression either before or after that pair of ENSO events, it's hard to avoid noticing the "slowdown" in warming, compared to the 1980s and early 1990s. But if you carefully choose a starting point just as ENSO transitioned from El Nino to La Nina, you'll low-bias the left endpoint, by including the La Nina in your regression and excluding the El Nino, which effectively hides the decline in the rate of warming. https://www.ggweather.com/enso/oni.png Here're a couple of excerpts about the slowdown in warming, from a National Academy of Sciences booklet (the source is in fine print at the bottom): https://sealevel.info/nas_booklet_excerpts_about_slowdown_in_warming_pp_7_and_12.png	UC7SuPFd0W50tfE-zpVFz5cw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7SuPFd0W50tfE-zpVFz5cw	1	UgiFVs1AJpM943gCoAEC	A.
