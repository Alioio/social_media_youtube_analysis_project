I mean we are facing huge problems connected to climate and this way of change of course could twist the cards but in the range of many year. We need change RIGHT NOW!

Individuals cutting down on meat, recycling, and driving an electric car will make a dent on that impact. But switching to renewable energy is the thing that&#39;s REALLY going to make a difference. Not you doing Meatless Mondays. <br />I totally advocate cutting down on animal products for health, climate, and even ethical reasons (whatever makes sense to you). In some places, people eat WAY too much animal, and not enough plant food sources. I know it&#39;s hard for me to travel to certain places cause it&#39;s so hard to find vegan or vegetarian options at restaurants and hotels that aren&#39;t green salad. So I&#39;m glad to see that it&#39;s becoming more mainstream, compelling places to provide more choices.	UCgqKw_5Epe3aOWlVKfS_SEA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgqKw_5Epe3aOWlVKfS_SEA	0

Now i cant wait to live by my own and to eat as less meat as i can. Actually sometimes i think why do people with less money for food tend to buy meat and other unhealthy food which is more expensive than for example beans, chosing to go vegan can make you feel good in many ways apart from helping the global warming problem!

Fish too, fresh caught trout or bass, yummy!<br />Meat and greens. That is a diet I want to try out. With loads of berries in the summer.. I live in Canada, so this all makes sense where I live. I can eat venison all the time and greens are so easy to grow and so very productive and nutritious too! I am mainly conccerned about my wheat and potatoe usage. I lean on these too much. Bread, pasta, crepes, potatoes. Meat and greens and squash, or other veggies like onions, garlic, cucumbers and fruits from the land as well!

You can let cows and bulls produce offspring that then get to drink their mother's milk until it is old enough not to do so anymore. That way the cow doesn't give birth to new calves all the time. Nowadays, a calf gets artificially weaned as soon as it can live off of artificial milk so them milk from the mother can be used by humans and the calf can be raised a little bit longer until it becomes veal.

If some environment conscious people start eating less meat and the supply remains same, the price of meat will reduce and others will start eating more. Governments need to take strong steps to stop more forests being cut down for cattle grazing. If the supply of meat reduces, the price will go up and people will automatically start eating less. This problem has to be approached from both supply and demand sides but I think more from the supply side	UCyLGLSZHmZNeWQ1lGTHeY7g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyLGLSZHmZNeWQ1lGTHeY7g	0

The volume of cattle that can possibly be raised like this is tiny compared to the volume of meat that is consumed and it is a lot more expensive to do it, and the cattle grow a lot slower. One thing that is not mentioned is to produce ONE pound of beef is 1,799 gallons of water, and beef is laced with such huge doses of hormones to make them grow faster and antibiotics to prevent infections that it actually exceeds the amount used by humans. Of course those drugs and hormones affect humans as well, and not for the better.	UCsD6GCcTSPnBq5QouAr3OMQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsD6GCcTSPnBq5QouAr3OMQ	0

I am trying to reduce my meat consumption for more than just mitigating climate change at an individual level.	UC16fsG6a7EaUluDC14xqlcw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC16fsG6a7EaUluDC14xqlcw	0

UgyETRmgpG1ZFNzU6jZ4AaABAg	1	0	2020-10-13 15:26:44	Pat	While all this is correct and good, the problem is, based off of the stats provided by the blokes at UC Davis, only 24-25% of climate carbon emissions can be traced to food. Massive, yes, but there are bigger issues too. And even in the case of the food industry there are problems. I’m of course referring to the companies themselves. Studies have found that 71% of all emissions are emitted by just 100 companies. 100. While it’s all well and good for people to take an active role in helping the planet, what isn’t good is contributing to the idea that it’s just our responsibility as individuals. Blame falls moreso on corporations, and if we’re going to combat climate change we need to combat said corporations more than we need to change our diets. Again, this isn’t to say diet reform is bad, moreso that it ignores the root of the problem.	UCT2dgsyLZfK56mRlfLMJqBA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT2dgsyLZfK56mRlfLMJqBA	0

It&#39;s not just about the carbon footprint thing, have we ever imagined that billions of cattle and hens, fish, etc are slaughtered every year for our consumption? When going out to buy a tub of KFC chicken wings or a McD meat burger, just think of that hen which would otherwise live and which was killed just to ultimately land up in your and your friend&#39;s tummy, when you could have easily bought a veggie meal by paying even lesser. Don&#39;t think that the one burger you bought for your previous lunch won&#39;t matter to the gigantic Earth, when several &quot;you&#39;s&quot; care, it will make a difference.

Climate change could refer to a number of phenomena, i.e. depletion of natural habitats and animal extinction, air pollution, bleaching of coral reefs, deforestation...

Plastic in the oceans kills sealife, which in turn limits biodiversity, which in turn has the ultimate effect of warming the planet (seeing as oceans are the lungs of the planet, converting Co2 to oxygen - we need our oceans alive).

Oceans are terribly in danger and we have only 5 to 10% of fish left! It is very important and if our ocean could be healthier (now it&#39;s NOT) it could absorb a lot of CO2 from the air and really make the planet healthier. Let&#39;s try to restore it and give up on fish, rather that make things worse than they already are. Eat chia seeds and nuts for omegas! It&#39;s hard I know, but we have to put in effort and to be less selfish than ever! Thank you for reading.	UCNwrmaJ6771rKorR1_hCvlQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNwrmaJ6771rKorR1_hCvlQ	0

But sometimes one person’s choices can infringe on another person’s freedom. In this case your freedom to eat lots of meat vs other people’s right to an inhabitable planet. What is more important? In this case I’d definately vote for a meat tax to reduce comsumtion. And more information because many people makes changes volontarily once they know the facts.

Like : you want meat ? Grow yourself the food for your animals ,in your own lands, because now is just too easy to cut forest somewhere else and plant soya for richer countries then do this process locally. We don't have the perception of how bad our impact is. When the last forest is destroyed then people will start questioning themselves iglf their choice where good or not . This should happen with every resources, not only food, but we both now that this system is build to predate and conquer others , at all cost. Humanity is doomed. So better speed up the process and hope the planet restore balance quickly (ice melting and mass genocide).

You're healthier and it's better for the environment. I went vegetarian for 6 months and then fully vegan 2 years ago and I feel great and more at peace with myself because I don't say I love animals and then turn and eat one of them.

Lots of people think it’s only something you can do if you have money. But rice, beans, lentils, and tofu (if you have access to them) are extremely cheap foods that are really good for you, have a high caloric density and lots of protein. I’ve been vegetarian on a budget for over a decade. Expensive vegan cheeses and meat alternatives aren’t even a part of many plant-based eater’s diets. In fact many of us talk down on these foods for being a waste of money and unhealthy. All I have to do is walk by the meat aisle in the grocery store to see how much money I’m saving by choosing other protein sources.

You mention eating a serving of lentils having virtually no CO2 produced, but they also have next to no Calories. Meaning, you&#39;ll have to eat more servings veggies to get the same number of Calories from a serving of beef. Depending on the cut of beef, 4 oz of ribeye would be the equivalent of 10 cups of steamed broccoli in calories. (This varies by source and fattiness of ribeye) Still likely lower Carbon overall, but not nearly as much as you initially implied. It would still add up to a mind blowing amount if we all ate better for our bodies and the planet. Obviously vegetables produce less CO2 per Calorie, but I would like to see how big the difference actually is.	UC_Ai_YJ_FIxrYkeTW08Sqxg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_Ai_YJ_FIxrYkeTW08Sqxg	0

We keep looking for how we can change our diet or use renewable energy or whatever to fight climate change. These things can make small impacts, but the only thing that will TRULY make a difference is stabilizing our population, maybe even reducing it through having fewer children. Our Earth has finite space and resources. It still takes SPACE to grow vegetables. It takes SPACE to create housing for new people. That SPACE that we take steals space from wild plant and animal species, worsening our biodiversity crisis. And with more an more people we will have a need for more and more food. More and more water. It&#39;s simple. We must control our population while at the same time investing in environmentally friendly initiatives. Otherwise, we&#39;re doomed no matter what. And we&#39;ll take all the animals with us. And I haven&#39;t even started on how some bodies just don&#39;t do well without meat. I eat meat only a few times a week, but I cannot go 100 percent animal free. I get sick. It just doesn&#39;t work because of my DNA.

Even the food you eat on a vegan/vegetarian diet is being farmed wrong and has negative impacts on our environment (yes, still better than factory farming animals). We have very limited harvests left with traditional tilling and farming. We need regenerative agriculture - that needs to be our priority. Regenerative agriculture and land use practices naturally sequester a critical mass of CO2 in the soil and forest, and restore healthy soil	UClogJSp0ctCK8_MPlkchBRQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UClogJSp0ctCK8_MPlkchBRQ	0

I have some friends who have tried veganism who have stopped it and then reverted to eating more meat than they had previously to “make up” for all of the meat they hadn’t eaten. Pescatarianism is quite popular here in the UK and I think that that is the sweet spot between eating meat and going vegan tbh.

I have so many friends, even ones who work in conservation, who care deeply about the environment but just can&#39;t give up meat. Putting more of an emphasis on reducing intake instead of having absolute zero meat intake is more encouraging to those who eat meat and don&#39;t want to stop entirely. Any changes made, however small they may seem, are actually great changes if everyone makes this one change collectively. I&#39;m striving to go vegan because I have no desire to eat meat, but if you just want to eat less meat than before then that&#39;s amazing and I&#39;m so thankful you&#39;re doing your part too 💗 We need to support everyone who is trying to make a difference in their own way.

If you're eating meals of pure carbs you can still easily be getting your required calorie intake but that doesn't mean you're getting any protein whatsoever?? And yes, for most people supplementing your protein intake with shakes is unnecessary, if you're going hard with weights at the gym and are trying to 'bulk up', then additional protein may be beneficial.

Do you think milking a cow is more cruel than KILLING it for consumption? Know the facts before putting up something. Cows can be milked till many days after their delivery. And it is only the excess milk that it naturally produces that is extracted for human consumption. A milkman never milks a cow completely until there is nothing left for its own calf.

I also care about climate change. 50% of the population goes vegan or vegetarian it kind be a difference maker plus reducing our usage of fossil fuels, it would be a big benefit for us and the earth.

Like duh 😂 she probably hasn't done ther personal development work needed when you go vegan and bc its easier to let herself get away with eating animal products once a month ( which I doubt she probably cheats more than that ) makes her feel comfortable, but that has nothing to do with the reality of how your body is built and what its designed to eat .

And even so, fact is, it has a very low absorption rate and you have to consume so much of that stuff to get enough on a vegan diet. My parents had a TV show about nutrition before I was born, so I'm very well versed on the nuances. Fact is, I wasn't getting enough protein and didn't feel satisfied. Some people can make it work, and it feels good for a bit, but after nearly 5 years of strict veganism, it definitely caught up with me. I feel a lot better now. I think we need to understand that our bodies are different and we thrive on different things.

It sounds more like an Omega-3 deficiency, which has nothing to do with being vegan. Brain fog is a common symptom of an Omega-3 deficiency. Omega-3's are essential fatty acids that help support brain function. Non vegans rely on sea animals to get their source of Omega-3's. However, Omega-3's are not produced by animals. They are produced by algae, which is how the sea animals get their essential fatty acids. Some people think that eating things like chia seeds and walnuts is enough to get Omega-3's but that's not true. Those plant sources only contain ALA. ALA can convert into the other two fatty acids DHA and EPA, however that's assuming one gets enough ALA and that you are not consuming too much Omega-6. Because this ALA conversion is unreliable, it is important for a vegan to take an algae based Omega-3 supplement unless they are living in Asia and are consuming sea vegetables on a daily basis. People on a vegan diet who are experiencing brain fog really need to start paying attention to their Omega-3 intake. It's not the vegan diet itself rather than the lack of education and information when it comes to nutrition.

You can make strides with a vegetarian or even a flexitarian diet. If every person in this world would stop eating red meat, cut their cheese consumption in half, and eat at least one plant-based meal per week, that would already make a huge impact on our environment and on everyone&#39;s health.

Rice is not essential for life. The nutrients in meat is. The numbers in this report are highly skewed <br /><br />So 25% is all of agriculture... 9% of that 25% is a fraction of a percent. Just so we can look at rice... 12% of that 25% is methane comes from rice. Still a fraction.<br /><br />Does processed foods contribute more? The health science is completely incorrect. The high carb diet have lead to a high rate of obesity and health related diseases. The less meat we eat, the more unhealthy we have become... is this really the direction we should go?

Nearly lost two friends to the cult diet. Might take some time to research the topsoil erosion from the poor farming techniques and how livestock are being used to reverse desertification. Also research anti nutrients, plant lecithin&#39;s, also how our body&#39;s can not properly absorb the vital nutrients in the plans not to mention the faty acids we can only get from animal products. Dare you to research these. Dont fall for the cultists dogma.	UCQ7bHQeaLkpWGagXKNrw7EQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ7bHQeaLkpWGagXKNrw7EQ	0

Isn&#39;t it also really important, that you eat seasonal or regional food?<br />Another question that I have is: You said that Food brings about 14% of the greenhouse gases, but is the transportation of food counted double or...? What I also think that is important is that sometimes land can&#39;t be used for agriculture and then you have to put animals there. Then it can also be better to eat that meat, that letting that space rot.<br />Otherwise really good video, I do think that eating more vegetables and less meat can do a lot to make the emission go down.

Ugy6Lh6Fgt6R53sxwyJ4AaABAg	0	0	2019-12-18 13:13:32	Joan Tendler	I hope that everyone knows that global temperature began to rise after 1980, after being stable for 55 years, and that&#39;s also when beef consumption plummeted. So, giving up meat won&#39;t make much of a dent, if any difference at all, in global temps. What is the real cause of this post-1980 rise in global temperatures? A major cause is the ever-increasing electricity demand from computer industry, which was beginning to take over our economy in 1980, just when the temps began to rise from increased CO2 from coal-burning power plants. The computer industry&#39;s insatiable appetite for electricity, which is projected to rise uncontrollably, as the industry automates the entire world, has also spawned fracking, which is the real cause of the recent spike in methane (not cattle!). Also, the destruction of the rain forest needs to be focused on, and Brazil has plowed up its rangeland to grow harmful sugar, so the rain forest is destroyed to create rangeland for their cattle. So, instead of giving up a very nourishing and essential (for many nutrients) food like meat, give up non-nourishing, indigestible, harmful, and rain forest-destroying crops, like sugar cane, chocolate, coffee, tea, wheat made into refined flour, soybeans, corn (corn oil and high fructose corn syrup), canola, sugar beets, palm oil, cotton grown for very unhealthy oil, crops grown for alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, and tobacco. Then, a huge amount of land would be freed up to pasture animals, so we can become healthy again, and to finally regenerate soil that has been destroyed by cultivation, which will enable carbon storage in the soil, the best strategy to deal with CO2 in the atmosphere. Also, let&#39;s put a hefty environmental tax on the computer industry&#39;s use of electricity, so they can finally pay for the environmental devastation that they have played a large role in, which will fund the renewable energy industry that computers require.

When I went vegetarian, I slipped up a couple times at first, but had a friend tell me that I shouldn't keep beating myself up about it because it's better to have a million people living a veg life imperfectly but trying their best than ten people living it perfectly. I think some people also have to understand how big meat can be in so many people's lives/diets and instead of berating someone for being a meat-eater, just showing them a different lifestyle and the benefits that come with it. Then, it's up to that person to decide if they want the lifestyle too :) - that's how it has happened for me and my friends!

Yes, these companies are to blame for what they're emitting; but we are too. They're producing these because our demand create the need and money they can profit off by doing those. So what we do personally as an individual DO matters in creating change about all industry like food and transportation. I just hoped all people would take this part of the economy more into consideration than just speaking of inflation or trade rates.

I agree that large structural change is essential, but your wording, and the fact that you commented on this video, makes me think that you think personal choices don't matter, when this video clearly shows that they do. Blame companies all you want, but no one's forcing people to eat too much meat, drive everywhere, and buy more than they need. We're all guilty of this, at least in high-income countries, and the least we can do is try to reduce our own personal footprint.

All a vegan diet does is allow for more people, it increases the carrying capacity of the earth. We shouldn&#39;t be trying to feed more and more people, we should be focused 100% on how to lower birth rates and promote a concept of declining population within a nation and rely on automation to make up for a smaller labor force.

But the problem we would be facing then is that we would need to grow way more crops, wich results in more land, wich would result in more deforestation all together and less trees means more carbon dioxide. And that is the big dilema of the climate change. No matter what we do, it allways ends up in one thing - more carbon dioxide in the air.

UgzZY8aAyIfJr1ct8XZ4AaABAg	0	0	2019-10-10 02:32:32	Edie Lee	How many people know what the Mediterranean diet actually looks like? I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to find that a lot of people are just as unfamiliar with that as they are a vegan or plant-based diet. For personal health, I&#39;d say the Mediterranean diet is probably the best and most studied but having tried at various points throughout my life to eat that way, I can also say it&#39;s not that easy. It requires cooking almost all your food yourself, as well as planning your oily fish intake carefully to meet Omega needs while making sure you&#39;re sourcing fish responsibly and with the right levels of Omegas. The people who eat a traditional Mediterranian diet, come from family and community units that are vastly different from the majority of the US for example. Small farming communities where women are responsible for cooking and meal planning, making sure that everyone is well-fed and keeping food waste to a minimum. It may seem like the less controversial suggestion but in practice, it feels a lot more like saying &quot;don&#39;t worry too much, just have a go, we know you probably won&#39;t do it anyway&quot;. That&#39;s not really good enough when we&#39;ve also been told that eating vegan is the thing we can do that has the single biggest impact on climate. It&#39;s also increasingly compatible with the lives of more people living in urban environments who work long hours. There is, of course, planning involved but based on my own experience as someone who lives in a major city, a lot less planning than the Mediterranean diet.

I&#39;m going to go on a diet with the sole intent of causing climate change.<br />Population too high? Hurricanes&#39;ll clean that up real fast. Deforestation got you down? Most trees love tropical temperatures and a significant increase in carbon dioxide will mean significantly more air for plants to breathe. Want to move to Alaska but it&#39;s too cold? Make it a little warmer. Nobody likes city life in the heat, and so global warming will prevent or at least slow down urban sprawl. Developing nations and coastal cities produce most the toxic pollution in our air and oceans, and it just so happens that those two forms of society will be hindered the most by rising sea levels and increasing temperatures.

These are the facts! Commercial meat production with confinement based livestock systems is the problem, not meat or eating meat. People, for these facts and more please look into regenerative agriculture. Regenerative agricultural practices use science, logic, and natural history to prove how nomadicly grazed livestock and meat from those animals can better our health ecosystems, and reverse climate change. PLEASE get the facts from ALL sides before you judge ranching and meat.	UCbpLOK_bHNoVZNs5EUzdeJw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbpLOK_bHNoVZNs5EUzdeJw	0

But I wish everyone could understand that whichever side you lean to, it&#39;ll put pressure there. Be it vegetarian or non-vegetarian. Today most people consume meat. But if everyone takes the life decision to balance food in their diet, trust me it would be much more healthier for anyone. But I really appreciate people going vegan or vegetarian. It&#39;s the need of hour now!	UC3yRg3e5m1ixLMdGoC86O9Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3yRg3e5m1ixLMdGoC86O9Q	0

Also, just avoiding beef and substituting other meats goes a long way towards reducing environmental damage.

There’s a 10 minute clip with Rhonda Patrick that tells for example why they say meat is worse: because the study was not made by just measuring people who only eat meat but a normal diet versus a vegetraian diet but the more recent studies have shown that if you combine saturated and sugar that is bad. So on the other hand a meat diet is lower on heart disease than normal diet. You can watch it, it’s hard to explain.

It's difficult to transition at first, especially if you've been relying on meat for nearly every meal. But I promise it is better in a million ways, including taste! Also check out meat substitutes or alternatives as well, they are getting so much better.

That doesn't mean that all meat does and it actually is the healthiest food you can eat. we have eaten it for hundreds of thousands of years.

I still plan on quitting red meat completely and focus on a plant-base diet, but trying my best to just buy what is sold in my local farm&#39;s market. (I also plan on growing some veggies myself!)

You don’t have to be a vegan and no one is forcing you to become vegan. Vegan or a healthy meat eater, still good either way.

And like I said, even if everyone in the united states ate vegetarian one a week, just once, we will have made a dent in a very large problem. Big results start with small changes.

We eat more locally than you all could ever imagine and factory farming for red meat is almost non existant for Indian people. Most red meat produced in India are shipped overseas, not consumed by Indians. Non vegetarians here mostly eat fish and eggs as a regular part of their diet, red meat is more like once in a month or two. It's not about wealth, we just know how to make tasty vegetarian cuisines which are much easier to prepare than red meat	UCR3U709iQwCfpxRviY9FhFA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR3U709iQwCfpxRviY9FhFA	1	Ugw_gQC68Wxl-jaXTtB4AaABAg	Yamcha the wolf

I respect vegans as long as they&#39;re not pretentious and arrogant about it. I just think the resolution is to just decrease our focus on livestock and make more carbon efficient foods cheaper, which is another factor that healthier more environment friendly food is expensive.

Depending on where you are and where your food is coming from, particularly your meat can restrict your diet. If you come from a low-income household, and cannot fund a vegetarian, or even Mediterranean lifestyle, that&#39;s important to take into account. Fast food restaurants make meat easy, cheap, and filling, perfect for low-income people. If you medically need some of the nutrients found most commonly in meat, such as if your body doesn&#39;t process magnesium correctly, so you have to have more than the average person just to actually receive what you actually need, then meat is a great option, especially in places like the USA where healthcare is often too expensive to be a realistic method. I&#39;m not advocating against not eating meat, I myself am a vegetarian for the reason of how wasteful meat is, but it&#39;s important to take into account that everyone has different factors affecting their diet.

But the important thing is that you give what you can from yourself, treat the world how you expect others to treat it.

If you are serious about global warming then “forced sterilization” of fast growing populations would be the “KEY”. If we do not do now, then nature would force us through famine, wars and diseases among others.	UC0mif2ch5v5wuX7FS4O6SrA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0mif2ch5v5wuX7FS4O6SrA	0

May they R.I.P. and might other vegans join an educated community that is willing to help them look out for their health, since it is scientific fact that humans during all stages of life, can thrive on a plant based diet. If they really are your friend, don't let their sacrifice be in vain by suggesting that they killed themselves by being negligent, or that they what happened to them wasn't from a place of duty, and righteous love	UCmoAzQ_XIKCxkIB1jIRDcWw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmoAzQ_XIKCxkIB1jIRDcWw	1	Ugzt6XSXb49S6FO-7yJ4AaABAg	Beatriz Brave Dela Peña

I got arthritis from eating too much dairy, which I'd thought was good for me because I had to get all this protein, right? The only thing I take is B12 and let's not forget b12 is added to animal products. It used to be in dirt but our soils are polluted with pesticides and most cows spend their entire lives on factory farm and never see actual grass. Let's be honest, most omnivores, including doctors, have no idea what constitutes adequate nutrition.

We get organic veggies delivered from a local farm. But wherever you get your veggies, always a good idea to wash them thoroughly before use. Of course the nutrients from animals tend to be powered by the food they eat too, so the quality of their food is important too. I found what modern farmed animals are fed to be so damaging to the environment and so "wrong" to find myself wanting to go plant based. Personally I advocate that people reduce their animal product consumption as its exponentially so much worse then plant based	UCDFuTWgVi1eCoQBh32L_GQA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDFuTWgVi1eCoQBh32L_GQA	1	Ugzt6XSXb49S6FO-7yJ4AaABAg	Beatriz Brave Dela Peña

The reality is people have to eat, and a large portion of what we farm goes to feeding livestock. Cut back on the meat you eat, and you cut back on the harm caused by farming. Almost nothing in the world is without consequences, but sometimes we can choose the option with lesser consequences, because not only is the harm caused by eating less or no meat better than the harm caused by eating meat, but it also means the resulting problems you mentioned (polluting waterways, erosion of topsoil) is easier to manage, because less farming overall means less of those problems to correct for.

They&#39;d never stand a chance of recovering their numbers in time, and the effect their absence would have on the rest of the eco-systems would cause the whole thing to collapse. Providing dairy for that many people instead of beef would be a waste of time too as the cattle would still need to be around to produce that much milk and cheese.

Although the vegan/vegetarian lifestyle is not for everyone, small and simple lifestyle changes can still have a huge impact on our global waste. Eating plant-based throughout the day and incorporating meat into my evening meal several times a week has worked best for me.

If I dont buy meat at a supermarket, it doesn&#39;t particularly matter because it has been grown, harvested, packaged and shipped to the supermarket. The meat industry will not take a hit until some big changes happen to our habits. What&#39;s worse is the same amount of meat will be produced for sometime and then it will just be wasted.

We should support local farmers and breeders and sustainable agricolture. Also for plants it&#39;s very important. ps. actually the waste produced by the animals can be used as manure (in italy it still is) instead of chimical fertilizersit&#39;s natural and it&#39;s healthier.( it is actually what plants eat- dead decomposed animals, their waste and water).

I went vegan three years ago for the environment, and it&#39;s the best decision I&#39;ve ever made! I feel great not only physically but mentally and emotionally. It has completely changed my outlook on life and other living beings, including our beautiful living planet. This year I decided to launch a blog to share a lot of what I&#39;ve learned in this process, because it definitely was a process. Basically relearning everything I knew about food.

I stopped eating chicken because I grew up raising them and I felt bad. I stopped consuming dairy and eggs because my body does not agree with them one bit and honestly it’s gross. Now I’m vegan lol.

While I eat meat very infrequently compared to most, I am moving to cut back more and more over time and this becomes increasingly easier as local supermarkets and cafes etc continue to stock more and more vegan options. But I whole heartedly agree, that even if you and the family have just started doing one day a week without meat, that’s better than nothing, fully acknowledging that it should not be your end goal and neither will it be the solution to climate change etc.	UC2wb5LM-9UhQSB2boxYKBew	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2wb5LM-9UhQSB2boxYKBew	0		
UgwfTqgu7O6dnvJ67T14AaABAg	0	0	2019-05-11 11:02:42	Clancy O'Neill	Animal cruelty argument aside, I honestly think if vegetables and vegan alternatives were subsidised as much as the meat and dairy industries are and we made an effort throughout western culture to treat meat as a delicacy (something you have infrequently and only of the highest quality) we could move to a more sustainable western diet, that was better for the environment and animals. Don’t get me wrong, going Vegan is the absolute best option, although someone like myself who has struggled with going vegan twice I understand the importance of giving people options in this transitional phase to a majority plant based diet society.

(Also isn&#39;t it a bit unethical to want them to dissapear?)<br /><br />Also, meditarenian diet is called that for a purpose. I believe that people should trully eat MOSTLY (maybe not exclusively) what is naturally available in their environment.

UgzpwKf9AWAdtW7jkEZ4AaABAg	1	0	2019-05-08 04:59:19	Riley H	I get all of the benefits of going vegan- but for a lot of people it’s just not a sustainable lifestyle health wise. I went vegetarian for a few years, and was planning on going vegan, but I saw a massive reduction in my energy levels by removing meat, despite making sure I was eating enough and taking supplements where I needed. There are quite a few people who simply cannot absorb nutrients (such as iron and B12) well enough from supplements or plant based alternatives &amp; I was one of them. I wound up anemic and dangerously fatigued. I’m happy that this video isn’t simply telling people to go vegan, like some of the comments are. I wish so badly I could be vegan, but for my body it’s simply not possible and I think a lot of the vegan community tends to see that as an excuse or not trying hard enough when it’s not. I know there are a lot of people like me out there, so providing ways for us to reduce our carbon footprint whilst still eating meat was really great. Thanks !

Humans need a lifestyle change, yes. But focus on what is actually foreign to most of human history. Our ancestors didn’t need cars. Why do we? Why can&#39;t everything be walking distance? If this is really about cooperating with the planet...we should use what is organically of the planet and not synthetically produced/fabricated. The industrial revolution may have made things convenient, but mass (over) production, mass depleting the earth of resources, over consumption, is the problem. Our human limitations that tire us out help keep the balance from over stripping the environment. We shouldn’t override that with pollution-causing tech. We need to slow down.

I feel happier and healthier and that&#39;s not only it. In a year, a single person who doesn&#39;t eat animals or their byproducts saves 100 animals. This might not seem like a lot but take 10 vegans, that&#39;s 1000 animals saved. You do the maths but for 1000 vegans, that&#39;s a lot of animals saved and also a lot of Methane not released into the environment. You might not choose to be vegan and I&#39;m not going to judge you for it but just keep in mind the animals and the global warming.

But then when I looked at the top part of article which says, "This article was published in 2011. A follow-up article refuted its claims," I visited that article and read it. Guess what? - It was agreeing with the vegan concept.👍 So, you better go and read that article. You are spreading falseness just to keep eating meat for your tastebuds. Also, that article shared by you was of 2011. We are in 2021, till now the research done on veganism is extensive, updated and is reliable. Go and check that instead of spreading lies.

Plus, I'm sure it's better to not have been born, than to be born, raised in cramped, inhumane conditions, suffer the whole time you're alive, and then be slaughtered (I'm talking about large scale factory farming). So your argument makes no sense	UCVyfcGfy1B5HwpVOjev9rgQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVyfcGfy1B5HwpVOjev9rgQ	1	UgxVFrYDkbNpVRYmvat4AaABAg	Kristiana Boneva

I always find the argument of animals lack luster, because if we stop eating meat those species will just disappear cause most of them need us to survive. So yeah you're saving animals but you might end up making their species disappear all together.

It&#39;s not that hard, you just have to do research and experiment with different vegan foods. It takes a little extra effort, but it&#39;s worth it in the long run. I lost weight at first because of the diet change. That encouraged me to workout, and I&#39;ve been losing weight and getting fit. I feel refreshed, and full. My body odor doesn&#39;t smell as bad as it used too, and my feet don&#39;t smell as bad as they used too. I only get acne on some of my periods(also cause of my skin type). I&#39;m helping the environment(both through my diet, and I volunteer, recycle, reduce my waste, and I don&#39;t buy plastic). I&#39;m also saving animals(through my diet, and I volunteer). It really does open your mind. I even tried meditation, which has helped my anxiety so much. Being vegan opened my mind into trying new things, and taught me to be more accepting and not give up because &quot;it&#39;s too hard.&quot; It really does help. Stop telling yourself I can&#39;t, and try telling yourself I can try. Or maybe I&#39;ll give it a shot. It&#39;ll boost your self confidence too, because you proved to yourself that you can do something you thought you&#39;d never be able to do. Have faith in yourself💞 <br />If you are going vegan. Or trying to, do your research. You can still be vegan and not get nutrients, or be unhealthy 💞Take care of yourself and have a nice day💞	UCaCfknGpMWpljk_GmTpK1rQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaCfknGpMWpljk_GmTpK1rQ	0

No it isn&#39;t? Of course it isn&#39;t. Especially not when you&#39;re talking health benefits, your health is still greatly impacted by the meat you include in a &#39;low meat&#39; diet.<br /><br />No reason to make people feel extra good about something that isn&#39;t that great.<br /><br />15% isn&#39;t enough. &#39;mediterranian&#39; isn&#39;t enough.

I started doing this several months ago and it was so easy to do, saves money, and is often healthier. Bring your own containers and buy in bulk. You&#39;ll begin to realize how much of what we eat comes coated in plastic (ice cream, Goldfish, dairy and non-dairy milks). This helps avoid packaging and materials that cannot be recycled (which produce a lot of emissions just to be made and more when they are incinerated). Seems too intimidating? Try one simple switch at a time. Stop buying packaged milk and buy oats in bulk to make super cheap and easy oat milk at home. Craving something sweet? Nix the packaged cookies and bring your own container to the bulk section to fill up on chocolate almonds. If we all did one switch as small as this the planet will notice. Have a nice day!

The reason veganism get hated is that you guy keep forcing it down others people's throat without understanding of sympathizing with their condition. As the video state, limiting red meat intake is also as good, the point here is to get people to be comfortable with the idea so that more people wil do it to help the planet, not shaming everyone to the point they just hate veganism. Honestly i don't want to go vegan because i don't want to associate with its toxic community. There are nice vegan youtubers who don't force people but just encourage them to reduce meat intake, some reduce slowly and would decide to go fully vegan. That's how we should do.

If we can live a healthy, normal life on a vegan diet then I don&#39;t see why not. There&#39;s not a very big sacrifice to make for such a great impact on the world so there no excuse not to eat at least more plant based.

There’s Grazing Land for animals only, Perennial croplamd for wheat and other grains which is also mostly for livestock and cultivated cropland for our vegetables. So diets with less meat waste more land that make us lose food that could feed people. Of course this only applies if most of the people go vegan	UCoXU4uOQNXCZVgPvEvOL8wQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoXU4uOQNXCZVgPvEvOL8wQ	0

The thing is, as humans we do need a lot of protein and it&#39;s very hard getting enough on a plant based diet, or even just a meatless diet. But as Americans we absolutely eat way more meat than we need to and it&#39;s awful! A Mediterranian diet sounds <del>so yummy</del> like the way to go honestly. One thing to note though, is lots of vegan foods are more environmentally friendly in terms of CO2 emissions, but require waaay more water and energy to produce, like almonds. So a vegan diet is better...to a certain extent.	UC5nKP7r8Qn90jReFWRJIfbQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5nKP7r8Qn90jReFWRJIfbQ	0

In the United States, all agriculture, plants and animals, account for 9% of greenhouse gases, transportation accounts for 28%. For the entire world 11% agriculture and 15% transportation. The UN claims that number to be 51% because it doesn&#39;t account for plowing, electricity, transportation etc. oh but it does. For all you who doubt me please see for yourselves.<br /><a href="https://www.c2es.org/content/international-emissions">https://www.c2es.org/content/international-emissions</a><br /><a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions">https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions</a><br />You are all being duped as part of the UN&#39;s big plan for a one world socialist government.

Maybe the demand will drop, and so the supplies too, but it would take a lot of time for that to happen. So I think instead of just focusing on the individual they should also focus on companies that grow livestock, and we should work together to reduce the emissions.

First, cow carbon is from plants and they get it from the air, whereas fossil fuel carbon would stay underground for millions of years if we did not intervene. There&#39;s a massive difference: fast carbon cycle vs long-term carbon cycle. You&#39;ll notice that almost all the studies cited only look at emissions but fail to mention the <i>net</i> addition of carbon gases to the atmosphere. The source of the carbon matters. Second, did the video mention a study but fail to provide a citation/link anywhere? <br /><br />There are many, many reasons for us all to eat less meat but just looking at emissions of global warming gases from livestock and equating those with emissions from fossil fuel burning -- as Ben Houlton does here -- is not a reasonable thing to do. On this basis, why do we not fret about the emissions of 7.2 Billion humans? The answer, again, is that like the cows we are part of the fast carbon cycle, not the geological one.

As we all learned in science class, weather is the short-term variation in the atmosphere--the temperature and precipitation TODAY--while climate is the averages of all those things over a much longer period of time. Climatologists prove climate change by looking at the differences we are seeing in the Earth's climate, and we see that it's changing at an alarming rate. That's how we know climate change is real. Meteorologists getting your forecast wrong today has nothing to do with it. Furthermore, your steak, which, as we learned from the video above, contributed to the production of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, thus contributing to climate change, will cause an increase in extreme weather. In terms of hurricanes, remember, warm temperatures in the ocean cause hurricanes, so warmer than average temperatures for a longer period of time will cause more frequent and more extreme hurricanes. Also, your anecdotal evidence of your own chickens polluting more than your own cows on your small farm, means nothing. We are talking about massive factory farms here.

Most plants that vegans eat need to be shipped from across their country or from across the world which causes way more emission than me at ex. Avocados, nuts, seeds, lentils. Also conventional farming methods actually kill more animals than just eating the meat itself.	UCudse9Ebf4A91pdT7lT_Z0Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCudse9Ebf4A91pdT7lT_Z0Q	0

We shouldn&#39;t be grain finishing cattle the way we are, and we produce a lot of highly processed garbage that produces even more trash (plastic waste from food, anyone?).

People make decisions based on what&#39;s available, they don&#39;t always act in perfectly rational ways, and when averaged across all humans, the trend in human behavior is always toward ease and comfort. The vast majority of climate change can be traced back to the supply side: corporations that produce that meat, use carbon-intensive manufacturing processes, and continue to expand fossil fuel extraction over clean energy sources. Even if I and every person I&#39;ve ever met stopped driving entirely, gave up on meat, and installed solar panels on our homes, it would make basically no difference on the world&#39;s carbon emissions. Even if I quit my job to become a transient, wandering around and convincing every new person I met to do the same, I&#39;d probably max out at around 100,000 people. If all of those people also started living the life of an ascetic monk, it <b>still</b> would make very little difference when compared to the 7 billion humans, and it would take me another 5 decades to do. We don&#39;t have 5 decades to fix this.	UC2iturPRumuOgxIGX9HNvtg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2iturPRumuOgxIGX9HNvtg	0

There&#39;s this huge pressure to go vegan, but to someone who grew up in a farming culture it&#39;s difficult, if not unimaginable to go vegan, so people usually give up on it before even trying. But if instead we were encouraged to just eat LESS meat and make small changes, many people (myself included) would make the decision to eat less CO² heavy meals.

It&#39;s not. Yes both are better than the average, but as someone who comes from the Mediterranean region and has swapped to a vegan diet for the environment and the animals, they are not two sides of the same coin and research consistently shows this. We need to be intellectually honest if we want to have an impact and as much as it is easier to get people to reduce their animal product consumption, rather than cutting it all together, we need to be clear about the fact that eating none at all is significantly better for the environment.

When you have loose restrictions like "eat it less", you go easy on yourself and allow yourself to eat it anyways. Whereas if you decide to cut it out entirely, you don't give yourself the room to make a choice, which more often than not means eating it anyways. Climate change is such a big concept as the world is so big, but when you learn about other reasons to cut out meat like the mistreatment of animals, it's something easier to relate to as every life matters and many people instantly become disgusted and are immediately able to eliminate meat from their diet.

Before that I saw game changers which interested me in at least reducing meat intake for both my health and the environment but after seeing Dominion (well the first 40 minutes couldn't get past that tbh) the only meat I'll eat is either meat a friend hunted themselves or fish I fished, and even then it's probably only gonna be if I need the protein boost and fall on hard times where I can't keep affording plant based meat replacements like tofu tempeh and chickpea flour where I wouldn't afford store bought meat either anyway. With all that being said I have to agree that it's better to encourage people to reduce meat intake by having meals at least once or twice a week incorporating a meat replacement and a dairy replacement as well if they're a milk drinker, while also educating them with facts about the environmental and ethical issues with the animal agriculture industry, leaning heavily into the environmental concerns as well as health concerns though careful not to blow the latter out of proportion or else you might lose credibility with them, namely because well lets be honest most people are painfully and disturbingly selfish. Show them how it might effect them or their children in the future and they will care much than they will about suffering kept out of sight and out of mind behind the factories walls. And it's also quite possibly a gateway into them becoming more and more willing to embrace at least a mostly plant based diet and lifestyle. As I try more meat free meals I find it harder and harder to justify eating meat ever where before I started I figured I'd have no trouble getting a steak with friends if we went to a steakhouse. The same would go for the average carnist too I'm sure, you see not only the issues with it but also that not only is there an alternative but it's one well within your grasp the idea of cutting out meat and dairy entirely or at least mostly doesn't seem so radical anymore.

The numbers are there, eating plants directly instead of feeding them to one over years and then eating that ones body, is always more environmental friendly. Also: Animals bodies, flesh and milk doesnt belong to us - that would be the definition of slavery. Start living like a human and stop whining over not eating &quot;your&quot; privileged steak and start living with basic decency aka stop taking whats not yours and start eating in a way that benefits other humans and the environment aka be vegan.

I used to love meat, but 1 week in and it has just lost its appeal. Going vegan really isn’t as hard as people make it out to be, for me it was more so about being healthier all around and improving my energy levels.

Agriculture accounts for 55% of all water usage in the US. By contrast, domestic use accounts for about 5%. A 2009 Worldwatch report found that livestock account for 51% of all greenhouse gas emissions compared to about 20% that account for all transportation modes combined. It is estimated that 1 acre of Brazilian rainforest land is cleared every minute. The vast majority of that land cleared is then used for grazing to sustain the worlds rise in meat consumption. Meat consumption is by far the biggest issue we face when dealing with climate change but there is just too much money to be made off the industry so this information is often buried. There is a great documentary on Netflix that lays out facts and figures of &quot;sustainable&quot; livestock farming. It is called &quot;Cowspiracy&quot;.

There is a disconnect sometimes with how ones actions can go against their opinions. Saying "we should all stop eating meat" while eating meat won't convince anyone to stop, stopping eating meat then saying it will kind of thing. Or saying "fast fashion is bad" while going and buying stuff from Forever21 is kinda yea. That kind of thing. Anyone can say anything or think anything their actions show how they really feel.

Not everyone will cut down on meat either, so really it seems like just cutting down will make a big difference, but you have to account for the people who will keep their old habits of eating a ridiculous amount of meat and dairy every single day. For those people, we have to compensate by making a bigger change in our diets. The harm that animal agriculture is doing to our planet is insane, but because it&#39;s such a gigantic planet, nobody sees the change. It&#39;s so gradual, but it&#39;s there and more people need to notice it.	UCh4CQ828eYrVphlKyye-t9A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh4CQ828eYrVphlKyye-t9A	0

If people stopped eating meat farmers wouldn’t breed cows so manically. Eating meat is bad in other ways too. Animal farming requires a lot of food to feed the animals, which needs space to be grown. This usually results in rainforests being cleared. Animals also need to excrete, etc. I recommend you watch the Kurzgesagt video on why meat is the best worst thing in the world.

Thats also not mentioning how the majority of farm animals are treated. No one is saying we should all go vegan but its better if we go a couple of days a week without eating meat. In fact, having meat with every meal was reserved for the wealthy until fairly recently. Humans have been living mostly on vegetables, beans, and carbs for most of their history.

This animals are fed with vegs scraps he produces at his own garden. It is a lot more environmental friendly to eat this eggs than to buy tofu produced 5000km away or mangos came from other side of the world. It is important to know all the impacts of our food.

AFAIK, grains have a much higher carbon load than grass and vegetables (including starchy ones) and also contribute to digestive issues for a lot of people.

It could be altering out gut microbiome's permanently. Looks at all the people with non-celiac gluten sensitivity. i should have gone gluten free ages ago due to my eczema. It truly is an enigma. A strange thing indeed. Actually though when you look at the mode of action of pesticides to kills pest insects. You'll find that they often attact the gut or act as an antifeedent for the insect. I'd imagine that over many years of consuming said chemical in the food system it may create a similar negative effect.

A balloon filled with normal breathing air naturally floats 50kms above the surface of Venus where the conditions are near earth like (same as in a car parked in the sun) add some helium to the balloon & it rises another 2kms up where conditions are the same as Hawaii, so no reason we can't colonise. Now in saying that, the tech we would use there to become self sufficient & build a habitat would be the same as we would need to build an artificial island on earth, so there's no reason we can't just do that instead, especially for the people of counties like Kiribati that are drowning with rising sealevels caused by our overuse of non-renewables. We would be more than capable of building them some floating islands to anchor to their existing islands & setting up recycling systems that reuse urine to grow more plants, just like we'd have to on Venus, along with basic levels of chemical fertilisers as inputs for farmland, either soil or hydroponic based. Once we get that working, we have access to 70% more space on earth. No reason we can't gift these people with some islands as experiments into obtaining fully self sufficient communities We could also start caring for grasslands that have huge productivity potential but are currently mostly desertifying due to poor management or destruction of native animals/eco-systems & then desertion by humans we could also just fund birth control of any type as chosen by the woman, for anyone in the world that wants it, along with basic health care & food for their children, because this is proven to stabilise populations, that as soon as their children show they will survive to adulthood & birth control is available, women choose to use it & have only 2 children each average or we could just declare war on someone & kill off large numbers of the population that way......

Environmentally, the amount of work that goes into it, what? "_ So the reality is that a rumen is very efficient. It can process 80kgs or so of grass or other cellulose material per day, fermenting it all & extracting from it the amino acids required for around 1kg of meat production. The rumen also comes with it's own transport system, generally referred to as legs ;) This is what typical ranches can look like https://www.google.com.au/search?q=australian+cattle+station&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjA3tPOkMfaAhXDGpQKHVZgBRAQ_AUICigB#imgrc=mGGS9nGHV4stmM: in that setting, they release those rumens on legs & let them find their own food & 12 months later, use planes to round them up again & muster them back to the station, where trucks are waiting to collect the mature ones & transport them to slaughter. They ensure that that land is scattered with small windmills & drinking water troughs so the cows can access drinking water once every 5-10kms in any direction they go, with enough water for a small number of animals to drink from. Those water points end up doubling as water sources for local wildlife too & so actually enhance the natural eco-systems rather than negatively impacting them. Other than that & the medical checks carried out each year, there's no additional work involved in producing meat based food that way, so it's dam hard for lab meat to compete with that efficiency. Each cow in that environment will need around 20 hectares of land to feed them. Lab meat needs to access the same quantities of amino acids as the cows do for growth, so while the lab meat will only need 1kg of inputs for 1kg of outputs, someone or some system is going to have to go through that 80kgs of grass & extract just the 1kg of amino acids from it to feed into the lab set up, so that's a lot of work we're now trying to do instead of letting cow rumens do for us. In reality, that type of land wouldn't be used, much higher quality cropland would be used instead & crops like soybeans planted with mechanical equipment, harvested & processed to extract the amino acids to feed into the lab meat, so that means clearing forest land to obtain the land with enough rain to grow soybeans, using the fossil fuels to grow them & then using more energy to extract the amino acids after harvest. Those crops also need fertilising, that can be done with chemical fertilisers, or the waste from the soybeans can be somehow processed to return the nutrients from them back into the soil, currently that is done by feeding crop waste to animals, who again use their rumen to ferment it all & poop it back out in ready to use form for the plants within a day or 2. Livestock currently do this with 6 billion tonnes of dry matter per year, of which only 14% is edible to us, 46% is grass & 32% is crop waste http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/home/en/news_archive/photo/2017_Infografica_6billion.jpg so we also need to find a way to deal with that waste if we don't feed it to livestock for conversion to fertiliser. In the days before people worked out how to make cotton seed edible to cows, the way that waste was disposed of was to pile it up in fields & burn it, that's the only realistic option that would be available again if we stopped feeding it to livestock & regardless of if that organic matter is broken down in a rumen, in a lab system, in landfill or via burning, it always gives off the same methane & CO2, so we don't even reduce cow burping emissions by removing them from the equation. So all in all, it sounds good, but in reality, nature actually has highly refined & efficient systems already in place in the form of animal rumens & we just can't realisticly compete with using them properly ie having them process only waste & grass, if we have them process grains we could eat, then that's inefficient, but used properly, it's far more efficient than we can achieve artificially. The only way we can really improve efficiency beyond that is with insects that don't waste energy on generating heat, therefore directing all amino acids in the grass & crop waste directly into meat production. The most efficient way of creating the lab meat would probably to have insects eat the waste & then processing the insects to extract the amino acids from them, so obviously it's therefore easier & more efficient just to directly eat the insects. I've got sources on lots of the stuff I argue with vegans, but on the lab meat I haven't really saved any, because it's always changing (while still saying the same, just a year & name update) & because it comes up so easily on google. Most of the rest of what I've said is a mix of stuff I've got from lots of websites & combined, but if there's a specific element I've said that you want a source on, let me know & I might have one here for that :) _"side note: i always like it when people agree with people on youtube 🤣👌"_ me too :) although I also enjoy a good debate, just as long as there's facts involved rather than the vegan ranting of propaganda & denial of anything that doesn't fit with what they want the truth to be.

You can also look at all the various press reports from the start up companies & year after year see them claiming that they will be releasing the product commercially by the end of ....(whichever year the report is writen in, or sometimes the following year). I saw one the other day for example from a vegan boasting about "just inc" & linking to stories on them, that company claimed they were going to have lab meat chicken on the shelves by the end of 2018 & that they had a plant based growth serum, but more research shows no evidence to support their claims of the plant based growth serum, but lots of investment money after that vegan food company announced that they had "been secretly working on lab meat for 2 years & were close to being able to release it commercially" prior to a funds drive. That's a typical presentation for all of them, repeats over & over & over. They can certainly all make lab meat, they put into the test tube/petri dish the stem cells of what they want to grow, all the amino acids that are found in the final product, sugars to feed the reaction & then the active parts of the unborn cow blood to actually cause those stem cells to interact with the amino acids in a way that combines them & over time it becomes "meat" I personally do plant tissue cultures as a hobby & this is a very similar process & easy to see how it works & that it does, in plants, same thing, you can take a part of a plant, a few cells is enough, put it into a test tube/petri dish, along with sugar & hydroponic fertiliser (that contains all the chemicals that will make up the grown plant) & over time it will grow into a new plant. Depending on what part of the plant you have, commonly you need to add different hormones/"plant growth regulators" as well, such as starting in GA3 to stimulate a dormant embryo to begin growing, then transferring into the same medium but with "BAP" to cause the cell mass to develop leaves, then transfer into the same medium but with "NAA" to cause the cell mass with leaves to develop roots, at all stages in the culture, the plant will grow just fine without leaves or roots, as all it's nutrients are coming directly from the medium it's growing in, being absorbed through the cell walls. When it comes to animal based tissue culture, things get much harder, because plants have the ability to fully clone themselves, while animals don't & require extensive scientific knowledge & skills to clone, but the basics are still the same, add sugar & the animal's equivalent of that hydroponic fertiliser, then add an extra catalyst to trigger reproduction of the nondescript cells (stem cells), then trigger them to form the type of cell that you want, in this case muscle. They can actually get part of this process without fetal serums (forgotten which part now) & they use that in PR claims to state that they have achieved it without fetal serums & are "just refining the growth process" but they can't actually grow from scratch to muscle fibres in a lab without using the fetal serum. All have significantly reduced the amount of serum they need (started out at 50 litres per burger pattie) but all have reached the same point & got stuck. They mostly use cow fetal serum because it's the most available, but they can substitute it for the blood of any unborn animals for any meat growth. The most promising lead on removing the unborn animal blood appears to be using human waste product blood, with enough of it, it's possible they may even be able to use adult blood in the place of the fetal serums, potentially buying all blood products that have passed their shelf life & need to be disposed of & using those in the lab meat, after further refining. They may even be able to harvest the blood of dead humans & refine it to obtain small amounts of the components they need to grow the meat. They could do that with animals too, but that defeats the purpose of the lab meat, hence why some are looking to human waste blood to sell their product as "ethical". They all talk about making a plant based formula, but there's just no evidence they're getting anywhere on that. So yeh, the can make it, no question about that, but they need to use both stem cells and large amounts of unborn baby animal blood to do so	UCZsUD6fbggZVj-l6XcBrPdw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZsUD6fbggZVj-l6XcBrPdw	1	UgwCId4nEpKEKFlT_z14AaABAg	Knowledge Is Key

Lab meat IF it ever happened would need to use cropland to produce all the proteins/amino acids found in meat, then separate them all out individually so they can be added to the growth formula at the correct ratios for the finished product, so it's actually not efficient, but add to that that all lab meat startups have been stuck at the same point for years now, they cannot remove "fetal bovine serum" from the growth formula & have it still work to produce meat. Google that if you want to really see the truth :( Everything they're doing is just for funding & PR but there's no genuine signs they're ever going to get anywhere, but they cover that by claiming "trade secrets" as the reason they can't give information as to how their progress is going, truth is it's simply not going, there's no genuine evidence to suggest otherwise from any of them, hasn't been for years. Insects are actually the most efficient source of meat & will always remain far more efficient than lab meat & I'm totally with you on the vegans! Their diets are actually really inefficient too when you look at them properly, but they seem to think that if they scream loud enough & often enough, they will con people into thinking otherwise (including themselves)	UCZsUD6fbggZVj-l6XcBrPdw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZsUD6fbggZVj-l6XcBrPdw	1	UgwCId4nEpKEKFlT_z14AaABAg	Knowledge Is Key

I have a friend who is vegan and was previously vegetarian and no matter how healthy or how many lentils nuts or beans she eats she still can&#39;t seem to get enough protein, the lifestyle for her is unhealthy and she doesn&#39;t get the proper nutrients and has fainted twice in the last 6 months from it, and that was when she was a vegetarian. Before you enter in to such a lifestyle change you should really consult your doctor and a nutritionist because there are a lot of people suffer from health problems with cutting out all meat. As the video said the Mediterranean diet is has low emissions and is a good choice and you still get the strong sources of protein. Everyone processes protein different and it&#39;s important to have a diet that is good for your body and let&#39;s you function properly.

I&#39;m not even skeptical about the process or anything. If anything I would readily follow that recommended diet, but... is there a point when only so few of the immense population are following it? Meat industries will still continue their business and livestock will still continue to be produced, whether or not I cut up my meat consumption, right? What&#39;s important is public awareness and people&#39;s participation, but we don&#39;t have that now...	UCWt8qT7l9KRWo0GLO70Fj2A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWt8qT7l9KRWo0GLO70Fj2A	0

While a Mediterranean diet is very good, it is often easier to completely get rid of things than to do them in moderation. I'd say vegan is the third healthiest diet after Mediterranean and vegetarian with the only downside being that there are some vitamins that you can't get from plants that you will have to get from supplements.

Chemical fertilisers are the cause of nitrous oxide emissions & they are 300 times more potent than CO2, v methane's only 30 times higher, & nitrous oxide kills the ozone layer too! Low calorie yielding crops also require far more deforestation to feed the world than crops like rice do. On a starvation ration diet, 1 hectare of rice can feed over 500 people, while the primary foods in most vegan diets feed less than 1 person per hectare & use more chemical fertilisers per hectare than rice does! Without question, rice milk is FAR better for the environment than almond milk is! Cut down on low calorie, fast rotting fruit & vegetables if you want to reduce methane & greenhouse gas emissions	UCZsUD6fbggZVj-l6XcBrPdw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZsUD6fbggZVj-l6XcBrPdw	1	Ugy60cRTKrXIOfHJD0J4AaABAg	Joy Willow

Take kangaroo meat, that's shipped to 50 different countries on the other side of the world to where it's produced. Roos travel up to 100kms a day, can just wait for them to come into areas near the processing plant & shoot them before they eat the crops being grown for humans, with them having eaten desert grasses their whole life to grow. Intestines etc are left for scavengers, blood to feed the soil, so as to keep the eco-system intact, desired parts of the carcass are simply loaded onto a specially designed rack on the back of a ute & driven to a nearby processing centre, where carcass is checked for parasites & diseases & body temperature, then skinned, then moved into a cleanroom for cutting & packing. large slabs can be cryopacked & then refrigerated & will stay fresh for 3-6 months. When a large enough load is collected, then a refrigerated shipping container full of high calorie, high protein meat can be put on a slow cargo ship to reach it's destination in a month or so's time, where it's unloaded & sent to stores. At this point it still has a refrigerated life span of months or a frozen lifespan of a year or more. Total resources used in it's production & transport were 1 bullet, 5-10 seconds of power for a spotlight, fuel to transport to the processing centre, fuel for refrigeration form that point on & fuel for a slow moving cargo ship. That's very little! Statisticly 80% of that meat will be eaten too, whereas only 55% of fruit & vegetables will be eaten after their transport. Beef, lamb etc have a similar production cost, but are usually transported longer distances from their farms to slaughterhouses, this is done live, so no refrigeration costs, but less efficiency in terms of transporting whole animals, so only about 15-20 tonnes of actual meat per road train, but after slaughter it will be 60 tonnes of cryopacked high calorie, high protein meat per shipping container, just like the kangaroo. Avocados by comparison must be picked by hand, one by one, so far less efficient than meat, reach processing destination & be cooled within the same time period as kangaroo, be sprayed to prevent stem rot, be sprayed with various pesticides, depending on destination country, be washed or brushed to remove bugs & dirt, be sorted by size so they fit into packing trays correctly, have imperfect fruits found & removed & disposed of, be packed into single level trays with extensive packing materials to protect them from damage from others in the batch pressing onto them, be transported in refrigerated shipping containers, but unlike the meat, most of he shipping container is filled with packing materials & air gaps in order to protect the fruit (and half the fruit is seed that will be thrown away too, while the bones of the meat were cut out before transport) & unlike the meat with months of shelf life, the avocados have only a few weeks before they will rot, so no slow ship travelling around the world via the most efficient route, their ship must travel directly to the sales destination & packaging must be designed to only transport the immediately required supplies to the destination country & another ship must leave directly for that country 1-2 weeks later & repeat year round. There is also the risk that one or more fruits may begin ripening on route, due to an extra fruit being thrown in the batch from the ground or similar & if this happens, it will cause unexpected early ripening of the entire shipping container & cause them all to be disposed of unsold All in all, if meat is being shipped because there is a better growing zone on the other side of the world, it can be an efficient use of resources, but fruit & veg are extremely highly demanding & inefficient transport items with huge waste levels due to such high levels of perishability & lack of adaptability to alternative storage methods such as freezing, canning, drying, smoking etc (some fruit & veg can be treated in some of those ways, but today's vegans are generally picky & demand their food fresh & refuse to eat anything processed to extend shelf life & increase efficiency of production, making them very high resource consumers!)

See what animals are killed in the protection of crops near you too. There will be massive numbers of mice, which you probably don't want to eat, but there may also be wild pigs & deer as well, if so, if you seek out & eat them, that will cause them to be humanely shot, rather than the cheaper but much crueller poisoning that's used when the meat won't be eaten. Lots of rabbits are killed to protect crops & are good to eat too, but be really careful if sourcing that, as most rabbits are farmed in horrendous conditions, so don't assume they're wild unless you actually speak to the hunter or otherwise manage to 100% confirm they are	UCZsUD6fbggZVj-l6XcBrPdw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZsUD6fbggZVj-l6XcBrPdw	1	Ugy60cRTKrXIOfHJD0J4AaABAg	Joy Willow

Scientists at Australia's government science organisation (the CSIRO) tried to experiment to replicate that in cows & failed, however in the process they found & patented a seaweed that reduced methane by an average of 98-99% when fed to cows as 1% of their diet & they scientificly proved it to reduce methane by a minimum of 80%. Now that being said, it's a gimmick. There's no correlation, let alone causation between ruminant numbers & atmospheric methane. There's been numerous tests in history, the North American bison kill off & rinderpest virus outbreaks in Africa, killing 10% of all ruminants (wild and domestic) fail to register on ice core samples as even a glitch & there are less ruminants on the planet now than at any time in human history. Methane is a natural bi-product of organic matter breakdown, the same microbes live both in ruminant guts & in landfill & soil. If cows don't eat the grasses etc, they still give off the same methane as they breakdown, this is why landfill methane levels are so high. The only methane that genuinely matters is the methane that's been out of the system for millions of years - the stuff from natural gas. There IS a direct correlation between natural gas getting into the atmosphere & atmospheric methane levels. Here's a bias discussion about that, but it's from a reputable soil scientist & I've failed to debunk anything she says, obviously the audience this is written for make it very bias though, but it's still interesting http://www.amazingcarbon.com/PDF/JONES-CarbonFriendlyBeef(27April10).pdf	UCZsUD6fbggZVj-l6XcBrPdw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZsUD6fbggZVj-l6XcBrPdw	1	UgxNb_mRH8NHfERL4Z54AaABAg	brendo

I'm interested in what you have to say, and it sounds right that if cows are all grass fed then it could be a better option. Unfortunately many are not, also I thought it was large in part to the methane cows produce, while chickens do not? Would be awesome if you could provide me with a link to a peer reviewed journal citing this information for further research.

The reason is that while beef has much worse feed conversion ratios, the food cows eat is almost completely inedible to humans, they have a rumen that means they can obtain calories from foods we can't, such as grass. Chickens are mono-gastrics & as such require grains that we could directly eat & so they directly compete with us for food, while cows are eating the grass & inedible crop wastes. That said, most chicken food is the waste that's left after soybeans have had the oil extracted to make vegetable oil for human consumption & so with that they don't compete with us for food we want to eat, but just be aware that feed conversion ratios don't tell the whole story. Cows raised in systems like holistic grazing are some of the best options for the environment, beaten only by eating the animals like wild pigs, deer & kangaroos that are killed to protect crops (and insects)	UCZsUD6fbggZVj-l6XcBrPdw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZsUD6fbggZVj-l6XcBrPdw	1	UgxNb_mRH8NHfERL4Z54AaABAg	brendo

The classic choice for boosting it a bit, according to most doctors, is eating red meat. Well, I have been vegan for the past 5 years and my red cell count and b12 is on the same, if not better, levels; I am being tested every year. I have a very active lifestyle and I work out 4-5 times a week. Plus, when eating meat and dairy, I used to get sick at least once every year and since I stopped I haven&#39;t been sick even once...not even once! I am not attributing everything to veganism, but I can honestly say that all these side effects and health risks advertised by meat lovers are just uneducated bullshit. Educate yourself and you will realize that veganism is absolutely healthy, viable and inexpensive.	UCks6KcZxq-r4DUQZUdxEbfg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCks6KcZxq-r4DUQZUdxEbfg	0

Its worth remembering that &quot;smarts&quot; and morality don&#39;t necessarily equate, which is why we are in a situation where it is legal, under biased man-made laws, to murder 74 BILLION sentient beings every year: Science and scientists are fine by me, as long as they are ethical and, not beholden to the current dominion of carnism, with its violent ideology and poor attitude to non-humans. <br />Perhaps its high time for a Morality Index for countries/governments and corporations/companies, so that consumer spending can more accurately reward the ethically deserving.

Grasslands have far more impact on carbon sequestration than forests do, C4 photosythesising plants (grasses) make up only 5% of terrestrial bio-mass, but are responsible for 23% of terrestrial carbon sequestration, so if they want to sequester carbon in a feel good, organic way, it should be by returning the bison ot the planes, or replacing them with cattle & either way raising them to move from place to place so grasses grow super long & then get turned into manure to put the carbon back into the soil & eat the animals so calories aren't needed from forest land	UCZsUD6fbggZVj-l6XcBrPdw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZsUD6fbggZVj-l6XcBrPdw	1	Ugz9jT3sS-ECrmLurjd4AaABAg	franco luis sotomayor

Dave3 rice alone yields 240,900,000 calories per hectare per year That means 1 hectare feeds 550 people or 18 square metres per person or 0.0044479 acres per person for total calorie needs, however calories & nutrition is significantly increased beyond this due to the fish & ducks also in the rice paddy. So citation needed that a "forest garden" produces higher than this please I'm calling you an ignorant fool because you ARE one! I have proven that again & again, see the above example! You don't even know what crops you can grow in this "forest garden", let alone how much land is required per person & it cannot under any circumstances meet all nutritional needs unless it also includes insects or livestock (cannot grow without fertiliser either) _"1) Trees provide max food per acre"_ clearly not _"2) Trees are one of the earths biggest Carbon sinks"_ no they're not!

Meanwhile crop farming is the biggest emitter of Nitrous Oxide, which is 296 times more powerful than CO2 as a ghg, so yet another fail on your part!

But getting back to the 1 Cow per half acre figure, perfectly illustrates the massive inefficiency of using animals for food etc. When 2.5 people on a Vegan diet can get all their food from just half an acre!. 5-8 Vegans can get ALL their food from just 1 acre, i would LOVE to see someone on an Omni diet live off just 1/5 of an acre!.

Whereas Tree crops lock up Carbon while providing food and natural wildlife habitats. Contrary to you statement re Tree no being able to grow in extreme conditions, well that is rubbish as well, COD Trees in the Tiger Forest grow in minus 30* temperatures, while deserts are being reforested in North Africa, where drought resistant Trees are planted first then as they grow and produce shade other less tolerant Trees, Shrubs etc are introduced eventually creating a cool micro climate where lots of food and other produce is enabling local markets to flurish, and local Wells and rivers return!. Trees provide max food per acre, while animal farming for food is extremely inefficient and is unhealthy cos we are naturally Herbivorous!.

Dave3 actaully if the cows are put onto the land of the same quality that is needed to produce that vegan food in that space, then 1 hectare of that land is generally accepted as supporting 8 adult & baby cow pairs (16 cows, equal to 12 adult cows). When intensive managed rotational grazing is used instead of cropping & harvesting, due ot the loss of teh need for drying time of the grain & reduction in grain loss to the ground during harvest, this can easily be increased to 18 growing cows per hectare, using accepted eating quantities & crop production quantities, with cows slaughtered at 12 months of age on average, that totals 30 million calories per hectare. An average person eats a little under 1 million calories per year, so food for 30 people per hectare. Seperate space is not required for animals like chickens though, 3 days after the cows have self-harvested that crop, a trailer full of chickens & their nests can be towed in overnight while they sleep & then opened the next morning to let them eat all the maggots that have grown in the cow manure. This creates an additional 15 million calories per hectare per year in the form of eggs, so that's 45 million calories per hectare per year, or 45 people fed per hectare per year. Rice is the highest yielding crop, with 2 crops of 6 tonnes average each, giving 43.8 million calories per year, so that's just under the cow/chicken combo. If fish are added, it can be increased to beat the cow/chicken combo (geese can be added there too btw) & sugarcane can also beat the cow/chicken combo, but no other crops can. Corn could come close IF it wasn't dependent on shortening days to mature, but since it is, it's limited to only 1 crop per year. You are comparing cows raised on land they are usually raised on, that looks like this https://www.google.com.au/search?q=australian+cattle+station&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjA3tPOkMfaAhXDGpQKHVZgBRAQ_AUICigB#imgrc=mGGS9nGHV4stmM: with crops grown on prime cropland, that is not a rational comparison. You are also not factoring in which foods vegans actually eat, you are calculating ONLY based on rice & ignoring the amount of low calorie foods that the majority of vegans eat as the primary part of their diet. It very much shows that you have never grown any of your own food in your life! You really should start gardening if you want to think you understand how much land is needed to feed a person!

But 1 fact cannot be denied, a Cow for example requires a min of half an acre of land, but to eat an Omni diet a person would need land for other animals they eat as well such as Pigs, Sheep, Geese, Rabbits etc all these animals require lots of land. Whereas a Vegan can get ALL his food requirements from 1/5-1/8 of an acre!.	UCrMIOWv9Rt-2T3chE3GeOfw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrMIOWv9Rt-2T3chE3GeOfw	1	UgwThtWYG5jAtWRPI914AaABAg	G. Dave3

Trees grow on land with significant water & low weather extremes. This land is always the most productive. Semi-arid/desert land simply cannot support trees, all trees are C3 photosynthesisers & C3 photosynthesis stops when temperatures rise over around 30c & therefore the plant cannot make the energy it needs to survive. At 30c, 2 plants that are otherwise the same but one C3 & one C4, the C3 will lose approximately 833 molecules of water per CO2 molecule fixed, while the C4 will lose only 277 molecules of water per CO2 molecule fixed, making C4 plants the ONLY plants that can survive in semi-desert & desert conditions. C4 plants are grasses. This is why semi-arid areas are always natural grasslands. C4 plants make up 5% of the planet's bio-mass, but are responsible for 23% of it's carbon sequestration. You're barking up the wrong tree if you think trees are the solution to climate change. Grazing ruminants provide C4 grasses with the fertiliser & pruning & seed distribution then need to be healthy (C4 plants require far more sun & fertiliser than C3's). Healthy grasslands sequester 100 tonnes of CO2 per hectare per year. This is well beyond any forest landscape, beaten only by peat swamps & the highest food per acre is from rice fields simultaneously growing fish for consumption (that's also one of the highest carbon emitting farm system though) Trees are not even in contention as highest yielding crop per acre per year! I don't even know which tree you think would yield even reasonable crop quantities! & 75 billion tonnes of carbon rich soil is lost each year in the production of just 3.5 billion tonnes of crops. That's 10 tonnes of soil lost every year for every man, woman & child on the planet! That has a HUGE impact on increasing climate change! Properly managed ruminant grazing reverses this & catches that erosion from crop growing & puts that carbon back into the soil to bring atmospheric carbon levels back down & btw the vast majority of those animals you speak of are 36 day old chickens. Removing the chickens drops the numbers to only 2.6 billion animals killed for direct eating, but hundreds of trillions of mice & other animals killed to produce that 3.5 billion tonnes of crops (averaging 25 mice killed per kilo of crop food produced)	UCZsUD6fbggZVj-l6XcBrPdw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZsUD6fbggZVj-l6XcBrPdw	1	UgwThtWYG5jAtWRPI914AaABAg	G.

If people stop caring, the world is doomed, not just ourselves, but entire ecosystems, and the state of our world for thousands of years as well. You can make a difference, and every person counts. I went vegetarian 2 years ago- besides the occasional wild caught salmon. Its much easier than I thought. I’ve also dropped eggs and milk along the way. It’s very rewarding, not just for your health but it gives you a sort of peace of mind. I know eating meat isn’t necessarily bad. But the way so much of it is raised is cruel, and something I don’t think many of us would be capable of if we had to work in those slaughter houses ourselves. Many workers suffer from PTSD afterwards from exposure to all the killing and brutality. You can make a difference- and quite big one. I’m not asking you to go vegan tomorrow, but please do consider that your choices have an affect on our world. Eating just a little less meat helps. Though it seems a small part of the whole, that small part is something that gets us all closer to saving our world.

By going vegan you help by 100% .which do you think would make a significant result? And always remember altho seafoods may seem lesser of an evil it is still evil. At times seafood damages your body more than other meat does.	UCKzrqiCPNXwcBPgZywto7zQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKzrqiCPNXwcBPgZywto7zQ	0

Protein is a more satiating molecule than carbohydrate and fats and so with a high protein food like meat you will feel fuller. However, you can achieve the same goal with high protein vegan foods, like legumes (peas and beans), nuts and seitan (vital wheat gluten contains between 70 & 80% protein but is deficient in lysine, so make sure you supplement that with legumes)! I was like that at the start, just constantly eating and after making these changes I actually feel fuller for longer. Also don’t neglect complex carbohydrates either, like wholemeal breads and oats	UCpJiFVGNRSD5wCTTEi15uHw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpJiFVGNRSD5wCTTEi15uHw	1	Ugz_yjxZvgj7NfnswyR4AaABAg	Sissou

Dave3	Simča PurpleTaeTae I’ve been a Vegan 35 years and never taken a supplement except B12, which I get from Savoury spreads such as Yeast Extract. Even Animals in animal Agriculture have to be supplemented with B12 in their feed, cos those Herbivores, like us, no longer get B12 from its source which is Soil and natural Water. I’ve not had so much as a Common Cold since going Vegan, and people say I look 10-15 years younger. I don’t see how anyone could have a problem with a Vegan diet, it’s easy, so many types of plant foods to choose from you never get bored, and every meal packed full of nutrition!. 🌎✊🏽🌻	UCrMIOWv9Rt-2T3chE3GeOfw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrMIOWv9Rt-2T3chE3GeOfw	1	Ugz_yjxZvgj7NfnswyR4AaABAg	Sissou

The numbers I know are a lot more disturbing, the Meat and Dairy/Egg Industrie causes like 51-60% of all ghg, thats also due to that methan is 296x more harmful to our planet than co2, good thing is that the amount of time our planet needs to &#39;dissolve&#39; the Problem caused by methan is lot less than with CO2. The 25% seemed more like only america. Sadly most animals can&#39;t have the&#39;freedom&#39; of the animals that you showed in the video. The animals that are rised like thate are 0,02-0,2% of all the land animals. All other are worse treated than most people in the Kz&#39;s in 1940, raped to constantly produces milk, fed with&#39;food&#39; and antibiotics on mass that will let them &#39;life&#39; for as long as possible, with teeths torn out, beak cut off (the beak of chickens has a similar amount of nerves as the mans genital), castrated, tail cut off etc. and ofc all that without anesthesia. The antibiotics is also in the meat, the result is the illness thats growing more and more frequently also called multi resistant germs. (They are feed every month with Tons of antibiotics so that the industries aren&#39;t bothered by them being ill (not few are still ill). Not to forget that thr reason woods are burned and cut down, desertifikation, water Problems and so on are also caused by our agriculture (One hamburger costs like one Dollar, but the planet it costs 660gallions of water and that is just one). Thank you for the video and raising awarness but it had less important information than it could have :p Just seeing the link between the problems isn&#39;t possible without the knowledge. To everyone who has read this so long comment, I recommend thr movie &#39;Cowspiracy&#39;. In 1 and half a hour it will be explained in much more detail than what I wrote, so that you can retrace what I wrote about. <br />You all, have a nice day.

The video says rigtfully that the vegan footprint is the best. Why not aim for the best? Also, consider the horrendous suffering you are causing to the non human animals. What a shame to keep spreading this misinformation about fish when we are, with our current consumption patterns, facing fishless oceans by 2048. Suddenly everyone is straining so hard for the environment by not drinking from plastic straws, I mean, are you kidding me? When at least 46% of plastic in the oceans in discarded fishing nets (doesn&#39;t account for other misc. fishing gear). You&#39;re lulling everybody into the myth that if they just change the type of meat on their plate, everything will be ok.

The western world is earting an ungodly amount of those foods because of trends. I mean have you seen that avocado only restaurant?? So stupid.<br />Those foods, instead of going to the local, people go to america or europe and theblocals end up not having the foods they normally had in their diet.<br />These country become more and more poor but they keep thinking that they will get enough money to survive by selling stuff to the western world. Spoiler alert: they don&#39;t.<br />Saving the planet shouldn&#39;t only be making sure the carbon emission isn&#39;t too high, it&#39;s also consuming less so that other countries can live and not over work the land by planting 200 plants more than it can take.

Compared to what? The average American eats animals products in some form or other for every single meal. Bacon and eggs for breakfast, ham sandwich for lunch, baked chicken for dinner. So by that measure, maybe you only eat meat of some kind for like 2/3rds of your meals and you can say &quot;I don&#39;t eat that much meat.&quot; There is a statistic that something like 90% of Americans claim to eat healthily, but 75% of Americans are overweight or obese. This is why &quot;Reducitarianism&quot; is totally ineffective. People cannot honestly gauge what they are consuming and are doing a lot more damage to themselves and the planet than they even realize. If a person takes the ethical stance against the exploitation of animals and goes vegan, then it&#39;s a done deal. You are not consuming animal products, so you are no longer contributing to the planet-destroying monster that is animal agriculture, which is responsible for 90% of Amazon Rainforest deforestation, 15% of all greenhouse gas emissions, and the total collapse of sea life in the oceans by 2048 from overfishing and the destruction of the coral reef. We have 12 years to make some significant changes to avoid total climate change catastrophe, so &quot;baby-steps&quot; are just not going to cut it.

This is the biggest and easiest thing we can do for the environment right now. If we don&#39;t do anything because of laziness, unwillingness to change, ungrounded fear for nutrient deficiency or, the worst reason of all, &#39;I just really like the taste&#39;, you, and the whole of humanity and all living beings on earth will pay much more for that for that in just a few decades.<br /><br />This isn&#39;t something that governments or corporations will solve, because big corporations are led by old men trying to grab quick, big cash with minimal costs or investment. Governments also follow the money. If we as consumers stop buying stuff, the corporations will listen and change to where the money can be made. This change can only be started from the bottom up and it&#39;s already happening. One drop of water against the current can&#39;t change the course of the river, but it can cause other drops to change their course, which can in turn get a ripple effect going.<br /><br />Don&#39;t wait, act right now and stop giving the animal industry money. It&#39;s as simple as that.	UCmQGuhGPwqfffRtN_GHplFg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmQGuhGPwqfffRtN_GHplFg	0

Just because you&#39;re not vegan, doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t admit it&#39;s the right thing for everyone to do. Drop your meat consumption, great. The end goal is to stop consuming animal products all together.<br /><br />Vegetarian does nothing for cows who are forcefully impregnated to be milking machines and have their babies stolen from them each year. It also does nothing for baby male chicks who are grind up and gassed alive because they can&#39;t produce eggs, or the way chickens are unnaturally bred and abused for their eggs.

Dave3 Eating meat doesn't cause an early death, eating only meat would, but diets like the Mediterranean diet have meat and are the healthiest diets according to most scientists. Processed red meat in large quantities will cause death and disease. Our anatomy is that of an omnivore that evolved from herbivores, we eat and hunt differently from other predators and thus our anatomy is different. How would you explain humans in nature hunting and eating meat? Are vegan city dwellers more natural than Bushmen or Pygmies (rhetorical question)? Natural humans ate and still eat meat, we can't eat only meat, but hunting, making weapons and eating meat is natural for us.

We like ALL herbivores have Jaws that are designed to move back and forth and sideways with flat topped teeth 🦷, Molars and Semi Molars for chewing, which is completely different to the design of a true Omnivore they have a Jaw that ONLY moves up and down, with sharp pointed teeth made for tearing/ripping large chunks of animal flesh, that they don’t and can’t chew. Which is why they have a v short intestines and strong digestive Acids. As for evolving, we are, that’s why Veganism is exploding, we are reconnecting with our true nature, and with nature, as an ethical compassionate animal we are becoming . ‘As it was in the beginning, so shall it be in the end’. living from food forests, and regenerating healing the Earth.

If you look at the teeth of a cow or of a horse, true herbivores, you will notice that they do not have such large canines. Our teeth resemble those of chimpanzees- omnivores, who eat fruit, meat, eggs and nuts, like us. Honestly, I can’t really be bothered to show you all the evidence and research, I’m surprised you don’t know, as to me it seems quite obvious. Please do your research more carefully and stop trusting random youtube channels instead of using trust worthy official scientific sources. It is pretty basic science.

No true Omnivore has any of those, cos shaper pointed teeth are better for ripping chunks of animal flesh, and they swallow it whole which is why they don’t have Molars or a Jaw that can move back and forth and sideways, cos that is the movement needed to chew!.

If that's not the case then why did other animals not evolve in the same way we did? Search it up, there is a lot of research. A lot of what you say is not properly backed its rather funny. Again, the foods that cause cancer are processed or contain many harmful hormones injected in them in order to make them grow at a faster rate, and therefore death rates from such diseases have risen through the past years due to our increased consumption in processed foods. I'm not saying go out there and just eat meat, I'm saying that it is important to have a balanced diet and to realise that eating meat is only natural for humans and provides us with many benefits. If we really did evolve as herbivores, then vegans wouldn't have to take supplements would they, that just shows that the diet is unnatural. There is a huge problem with people not realising that actual meat itself isn't bad and what is bad instead is the huge factory farming process which injects animals with rubbish which is causing us death.

We have all the physical attributes of a Frugivore, jaws and teeth designed for chewing, the Stomach acid of Omnivores/Carnivores is much stronger to digest large chunks of animal flesh. Also unlike Herbivores/Frugivores, meat eaters have a much smaller intestines so animal flesh can pass quickly through and not putrify. But more than anything else our Jaw, teeth and lips are obviously that of a Herbivore. Also if we were naturally meat eaters why is it the biggest cause of Heart Disease?. Which is the biggest killer of people in the ‘meat based diets of the ‘developed’ countries, not to mention Gout, Stroke’s, Cancer, Asthma. Did you know that even the ‘World Health Organisation’( WHO) has categorised meat as a ‘Group 2’ Carcinogen, and processed meat as a ‘Group 1’ Carcinogen.

We started evolving and then went on to eat meat in order to be able to supply our growing brain with enough energy. Then we started cooking our meat, meaning we did not need to evolve in such a way which would make us have the same teeth as flesh eaters. We also have several other factors which show that we are meant to eat meat, for example, the adicity of our stomach. Our stomach acid has a pH of around 1.5, so rather low, meaning that we have a diet high in bacteria. Scavengers have a pH of 1.3, so similar to humans, but herbivores have a pH of around 4.1-6.1 (depending on whether they are a foregut or hindgut herbivore) showing that in fact, our diet naturally contains meat.

Fasting raises your lipoproteins both total and LDL and fasting is healthy. Meat does not contain IGF but can raise it after a meal and it's totally normal to do so. To cut out meat from our diets lower our intake of essential nutrients and leads to worse food security and wasting of feed.

As I said before, junk food can cause most of this problems, so I don’t think eating meat can be the main cause for this.

As for Cancer, the WHO has classified Animal flesh( aka meat) as a Category B Carcinogen and processed animal flesh as a Category A Carcinogen, animal flesh has a substance known as IGF1 which can cause Cancer. .

Then there’s wild food that is usually around unless you live in the centre of a city. Wild foods i gather are Cherries, Nettles, Chestnuts and other Nuts, Blackberries etc etc. Plant Milk is easy and v cheap to make, I buy a Kilo of Jumbo Oats, soak em for 20 mins then whizz them up with a few cups of water, drain through a strainer then that’s it a litre of Plant milk for about 10p.

There is nothing in a Vegan diet that would cause Acne, the reverse is the case. Re Iron, if you wasn’t getting enough Iron you def wasn’t eating a healthy Vegan diet, that has multiple rich sources of Iron. Lastly having gut or intestinal problems may be due to eating Quorn and or too many Animal ‘product’ substitutes or not eating a high enough % of raw food which is an important part of a healthy diet.

Dave3	Janko I don’t eat any of those exotic Fruits and have lived on a Vegan diet for 35 years with approx half my food being Raw, so lots of energy saved there!. I am not just a Vegan but an environmentalist, so I grow as much of my own food I can from a Balcony and Window seals. I can honestly say that only about 25% of my food is imported, but if I had a garden, some land or an allotment I would be 90-95% self sufficient in food. On the other hand, the Western Omni diet relies heavily on (80% of world) imported Grain and Legumes ( and 1/3 of all commercially caught fish). The 70 Billion animals bred for eating( 10 for every man woman and child) require vast amounts of food/land, 75% of all commercially grown grain and Legumes, most of which is imported from the poor Eastern countries to the wealthy West, so we can carry on with the unnatural habit of killing animals to eat!.

Flesh eaters have long pointed teeth for tearing and ripping large chunks of flesh to be swallowed whole, with claws to help catch prey. Whereas Humans and other Herbivores have long arms and hands made for grasping fruit, leaves and veg, and teeth and Jaw designed to chew before swallowing. We are naturally Herbivores!.

First please send the vegetables in question I'd be interested in this I don't know if it was a trusted link. I'd say most vegetables have 2.9 grams of protine per 100 grams spinach has 2.9 Broccoli 2.8 Watercress 2.9 There the top 10 vegetables with protine Nuts however about 20 grams of protine which is good there are vital vitamins like b12 which you don't want to be deficient in the b12 in soya milk which I wouldn't drink as it mimics estrogen levels effecting testosterone but it says vitamin b12 usually the opposite end of b12 the bit not useful which minipulates customers unaware There's 25 grams of protine in red meat you probably need with 200 grams of nuts or 150 grams of red meat I personally don't like nuts too much but likes steak but I DO agree treatment if animals needs further review.

There's. Lot of deception in vegan lifestyle they tell you stuff like plant protein over meat when meat indeed holds far more protein. 2nd is that I like oat milk I read on the side if your interested read or if not go no further then it waffled on about plant protein whoever written it sounded subconscious about opinions. In my view I think bring omnivorous is the best diet scientifically weather you agree or not is up to you science is facts and indisputable however the science to vegans is up to individual peoples immunity and some people can't rock the diet so I know omnivore is a diet for all based on the science of it I also know the benefits of meat however I hate the way animals are treated however there are true and false ads in the vegan industry for example animals with no UK tags on with Hollywood sound tracks and mass farm only 5 animals were effected in the video.

I Love Bea Johnson author of Zero Waste Home, Organically Clean Home by Becky Rapinchuk, the channel FairylandCottage all helped me these last few months transition towards zero waste living. It's not 100% but so worth the goal! Already saving a lot of money. Started with the years worth of zero waste laundry soap under 20.00 bucks for our family, not to mention the plastic. Next goals is more raised garden beds & vertical water garden towers no dirt, coconut fibers & on wheels to roll indoors for colder temperatures. Yes, very exciting for anyone going zero waste! Hoping your journey will go strong and well. Please, keep inspiring!	UC6p1X_t2Fxnnf13v7knRrqg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6p1X_t2Fxnnf13v7knRrqg	1	UgzEBfT7iiBN23Tzz3h4AaABAg	M. Kędzierska

If you eat the right things and check signs for deficiency in protein etc you’ll be doing yourself and the planet a favour. Humans do not need meat and many vegans do not eat eggs because of the way chickens are treated in SOME/MANY farms or factories and yes meat has helped humans existence in the past but right now it’s doing a negative impact on global warming and some people’s health. If the whole human race gave up meat overall they’d be a lot less normalised animal abuse.

The germ theroy of disease or the atomic atoms all in one. Anyway back to evolution and it is what helped us to walk instead of climbing from tree to tree for fruits etc etc and what if we stop eating meat altogether what are the consiquences of this we just haven't explored this long enough to know full but I know that meat has lots of roles in humanity.

I agree with the message of this video, but vegan (and I hate how politically charged that term is) is the only diet that can claim the following:<br /><br />1. Reverse heart disease and some cancers. See ornish research. Mediterranean is not as healthy as it seems unless you barely eat animal products. <br />2. Cuts carbon footprint to nearly nothing. <br />3. Lowers cost of healthcare per item 1. <br />4. Helps reduce risk of super infectious bugs which thrive in poultry, pork and livestock populations<br />5. Conserves water supply- reduced use and no pollution.

Even cutting back on meat still kills an animal. All I see is the excuse of &#39;meat taste gud&#39; hiding behind people pretending that that are making a difference because they skip meat for one meal. There is no logical argument against veganism. Meat eaters feelers get hurt because they refuse to better themselves and lash out on vegans who are the only ones in this day and age that are actually making a positive change. It is simply cognitive dissonance and willful ignorance. Go vegan, simple as that.	UChj3CaXM_b3uMSfvh1n3aIw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UChj3CaXM_b3uMSfvh1n3aIw	0

I must say I am super reassured by the comments here! in my relatively short lifetime, so much has changed in terms of awareness around what we eat and how that impacts the health of our bodies and the planet. Seeing the comments, and the open-mindedness of folks here to make small personal changes that will involve short term pain for long term good ---- I think we&#39;re in pretty good shape! The comments section can typically be so negative but here I feel a shared sense of humanity and that we&#39;re all in this together.

However, whats the point of it if the meat industry doesn&#39;t follow suit? A lot of the blame is put on the consumer while the majority of the pollution is happening on the farms. We would be doing a good thing by changing our diet but this needs to be a universal effort.	UCSOmpqJxkaDiemTavp8zqAg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSOmpqJxkaDiemTavp8zqAg	0

Now I don&#39;t eat eggs and I occasionally have cheese. Its all a process. People say they will never go vegan which is what I would have said 3 years ago. But if you make little changes to your diet they add up over time. Just be open to the idea and don&#39;t shut off ideas which conflict with what you&#39;ve been doing or what you&#39;ve been told your whole life. Going vegan or vegetarian is not a diet, it&#39;s a life choice. <br /><br />Just start with one meal a week, or one day. Over a lifetime that adds up to be a lot.

Especially because dairy was never really a necessity for me anyway, and I could easily eat alternatives. Skin got better and I felt much better, and I eventually just fully cut out meat as well. I definitely suggest people AT LEAST fully cut out dairy or mostly cut it out, even if you won’t fully be vegan or something.

All the facts imply that a vegan diet is more effective at reducing emissions, yet the Mediterranean diet was the focus. That is slightly disingenuous. Meat (Carnism) has such a strong hold on people, the idea of not eating meat was literally out of the question. <br /><br />We don’t all have to go vegan, but if you want to maximize your ethical impact then you should. Veganism doesn’t just produce way fewer greenhouse gases, it also can leads to more responsible land use and crop production (which was given one sentence in this video), a lower chance of the proliferation of antibiotic resistant bacteria, and avoiding the myriad of others negative environmental impacts of animal agriculture (like damaging water and leading to deforestation). If this was a serious video, it would’ve mentioned veganism more explicitly.	UCDL68UnQjHVDQVUmkKIPHtQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDL68UnQjHVDQVUmkKIPHtQ	0

Sea is not sustainable, in fact it is so bad that fish stocks that were once common are not any longer. Over fishing the Med. has caused Southern European countries surrounding the area to start fishing of the coast of West African Nations and in a not sustainable way i might add.

Really, this may have been done before the National Geographic oceanographers estimate that by 2048 there will only be dead oceans, because surely they would not be recommending a Mediterranean diet (includes fish) if they knew this! Also, Why only 15 %?? Why not promote what would really help the climate- veganism. Too scared? Promoting only cutting down is reducing the chances of really saving the planet. The reason they don&#39;t promote vegansim, is because they want to justify that they are still not vegan, even though the evidence is clearly in front of them.

They&#39;re foregut fermenters, and the process of methanogenesis in their rumen is what creates CH4 like with any other ruminant including bison, elk, sheep, impala, etc. Methanogens in the rumen produce CH4. So enteric methane is more &quot;burps&quot; than &quot;farts.&quot; That enteric methane also has a context, so like with any source of CH4 emissions you have to look at the entire ecosystem not just GROSS emissions...You have to look at NET emissions instead. Net emissions account for CH4 sinks as well. These sinks include geospehric sinks like methanotrophic bacteria in the soil, and tropospheric sinks likehydroxyl radicals in the atmosphere. In fact, most CH4 is oxidized, and CH4 in general is short lived so it doesn&#39;t accumulate as much as CO2, this is why the whole notion of CO2 equivalency is being re-evaluated - Read: <a href="https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/news/2018_news_Climate_Pollutants_GWP">https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/news/2018_news_Climate_Pollutants_GWP</a><br /><br />I go into this all in a lot more detail here in this blog entry: <br />Ruminations: Methane math and context <a href="https://lachefnet.wordpress.com/2018/05/04/ruminations-methane-math-and-context">https://lachefnet.wordpress.com/2018/05/04/ruminations-methane-math-and-context</a><br /><br />###	UCaPCYyWUqyQ3FGKvPbAEXmg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaPCYyWUqyQ3FGKvPbAEXmg	0

But Frank Mitloehner, an air quality specialist from the University of California at Davis (UCD), said the U.N. reached its conclusions for the livestock sector by adding up emissions from farm to table, including the gases produced by growing animal feed; animals&#39; digestive emissions; and processing meat and milk into foods.<br /><br />But its figures for transport did not add up emissions from well to wheel; instead, it considered only emissions from fossil fuels burned while driving.<br /><br />&quot;This lopsided &#39;analysis&#39; is a classical apples-and-oranges analogy that truly confused the issue,&quot; Mitloehner said on the university&#39;s Web site.<br /><br />Mitloehner also pointed to the fact that leading authorities agree raising animals for food accounts for about 3 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S., while transportation creates an estimated 26 percent.<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/science/03/24/meat.industry.global.warming/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/science/03/24/meat.industry.global.warming/index.html</a>	UCVmurZXXWaPI0byd6LfrwtQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVmurZXXWaPI0byd6LfrwtQ	0

They signed a petition with the following purpose:<br /><br />The purpose of the Petition Project is to demonstrate that the claim of “settled science” and an overwhelming “consensus” in favor of the hypothesis of human-caused global warming and consequent climatological damage is wrong. No such consensus or settled science exists. As indicated by the petition text and signatory list, a very large number of American scientists reject this hypothesis.<br /><br />Publicists at the United Nations, Mr. Al Gore, and their supporters frequently claim that only a few “skeptics” remain – skeptics who are still unconvinced about the existence of a catastrophic human-caused global warming emergency.<br /><br />It is evident that 31,487 Americans with university degrees in science – including 9,029 PhDs, are not &quot;a few.&quot; Moreover, from the clear and strong petition statement that they have signed, it is evident that these 31,487 American scientists are not “skeptics.”<br /><br />These scientists are instead convinced that the human-caused global warming hypothesis is without scientific validity and that government action on the basis of this hypothesis would unnecessarily and counterproductively damage both human prosperity and the natural environment of the Earth.<br /><br />Nobody can ignore the fact that 31,487 American scientists have signed this petition, including 9,029 with PhDs – <a href="http://www.petitionproject.org/">http://www.petitionproject.org</a>	UCJD7zGWyRk-KXPzJJBPK8xQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJD7zGWyRk-KXPzJJBPK8xQ	0

Vegan is the least harmful to living beings. Dairy, eggs, and fish still have a large amount of cruelty behind them. So when choosing a diet that cause the least amount of harm to the environment AND to the animals, vegan is the way to go. <br /><br />Check out Earthlings on Netflix to see the cruelty that actually that is necessary in the dairy, egg, and fishing industry. By cutting out these products as well as other meats from our diets, you are doing the least harm imaginable. Which should always be the goal.

I especially like the argument that you don&#39;t have to be full-on vegan to have a significant impact on your health, the planet and our resources. I find this is sometimes a &quot;turn off&quot; for those folks who want to do something but don&#39;t want to give up meat entirely. I get it and I think it&#39;s important for them to know that even cutting their current meat consumption by 1/2 can have a HUGE positive impact! I follow a 90% plant-based diet and am happy to say that after leading by example (and cooking for my friends and showing them how amazing plant-based/vegan meals can be), I have influenced at least two people to go plant-based and a handful of others to consider reducing red meat consumption and opting for fish instead. Thanks again!!	UCp9YBx0kbXcIGDjSpFBvm-Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp9YBx0kbXcIGDjSpFBvm-Q	0

Scientists write that the arctic is melting faster than previously thought. We do not know when the methane under the ocean will be exposed. Giving people the idea there is time to wait, and don&#39;t need to do everything they can, may keep us from surviving. But, not to panic, gong vegan is very rewarding. Did you know that the World Wild Life Fund said that 52% of all wild vertebrates were killed between 1070 and 2012 and 58% were killed between 1070 and 2014, As Sailesh Roa PhD has calculated, at that same rate will have no more wild vertebrates by 2026. Not to panic, but taking t so lightly as to say just a little bit will do is not enough. People need to know the seriousness of the situation. Please see Dr . Rao&#39;s presentation to the European Union Parliament or see his talk at the 2015 Paris Climate Talks. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PgMETKrQD4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PgMETKrQD4</a>	UClJvSXZ_5S1JbrzETdiD9Qg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UClJvSXZ_5S1JbrzETdiD9Qg	0

This is the real reason I started eating a lot less meat: it benefits the planet, and that&#39;s what really matters. Overfishing? Eat farmed ones and slip chicken in once in a while, and dont eat only one type of food so often! Simple! Stop saying &quot;what if blablabla&quot;, you&#39;re helping less than people who really do something about climate change.

And I&#39;m sure that if we were to change our diet, green peace would find a new issue with our diets or something else we are doing that would be just as radically stupid as removing or even lowering the amount of meat we eat	UCxSnsdGnGT-rQT4O14XMcHg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxSnsdGnGT-rQT4O14XMcHg	0

Ugy2c7L4hBrXhiNt2dB4AaABAg	0	0	2018-05-29 12:06:28	ANTI-YOU	One thing thats not really brought up in this video at all is vegetables and fruit are literally flown in from halfway around the world as a lot are not native or in season. A vast majority of what you&#39;d buy from the supermarket to fulfil a human body on a plant based diet has been:<br />1. Grown (With bone meal and animal blood for minerals)<br />2. Harvested (Polluting machinery)<br />3. Packaged (Harmful to environment)<br />4. Transported (Literally flown halfway across the world)<br />Therefore the information in this video is irrelevant and misleading. If we all started a ketogenic diet incorporating locally raised/grass fed animals and local in season vegetables, not only would we need to eat less (High fat consumption means eating less meals) but we would reduce our carbon footprint enormously.

If companies can go more eco, normal people would not have to cut their meat consumption too hard to save the planet. By the way, Asians consume less meat than Europeans and Americans, but Asians rarely claim to be vegan. In the west, being vegan is almost a political gesture, but In Asian, it&#39;s just a personal thing, a personal choice. My grandma, may her soul rest in peace, used to go vegetarian only during the weekend, for her own well-being and for paying respect to Buddha. She was eating at the same table with us, eating only veggie dishes while the rest of us were eating both meat and vegetables, and no question asked, knowing that Chinese share dishes at the table, instead of serving them separately for each one like in Western fashioned table service, and that does not disturb anyone. So it&#39;s not about going vegan or not, it&#39;s about everyone thinks they&#39;ve got the right to pick other&#39;s nose just because people do things differently and have different thoughts. They used to fight for religions, and still are, and now they fight for food choice. That is the so-called supremacy of the Western culture, seems like stupidity and arrogance, just like Cain in the Bible.

When you&#39;re pets, friends or relatives die, don&#39;t just waste them by burying them, you can get a surprising amount of meat out of just one human or a dog. I call this the &#39;eat an animal you&#39;ve become familiar with, and now have a strong bond with, but they&#39;re dead now, so you might as well eat them&#39; diet. It trumps the Mediterranean diet you&#39;ve promoted in this video due to the fact that you&#39;ve forgotten to mention that Italy and Greece barely eat any processed foods (it&#39;s seen as a bit culturally weird still, although, that&#39;s changing...), and a great, great deal more of their agriculture is localised. This doesn&#39;t really work outside of those countries.	UCLd1M5SBR7RenGCZgNcnaYg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLd1M5SBR7RenGCZgNcnaYg	0

I switched very gradually but in a way wish I would have just tried it sooner. The Heath results I got just from the diet change we’re incredible. My extra stomach fat literally melted away. I initially did it for the environment but after becoming mostly vegan I was able to question myself ethically and couldn’t justify putting my 10 minutes of taste preference over an entire life of cruelty for an animal. I know that pretty much everyone out there cares about either animals, their health, or the planet so there are endless reasons to go vegan. You just have to have the strength to question your beliefs and traditions which is a hard thing to do!	UChyuwaf7GpMCip886lLupxA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UChyuwaf7GpMCip886lLupxA	0

Obviously there&#39;s the environmental impact as stated (and yes, I agree reducing is worthwhile), the benefit to the animals that aren&#39;t being slaughter or treated as commodities which causes inherent harm in a capitalist society. It&#39;s also important to note the impact on humans and I don&#39;t mean the health of those eating meat or even those in developing countries who are most effected by climate change. Slaughter house workers (how are largely immigrants and poor people) have extremely high rates of mental health issues given the unnatural and damaging nature of their work- repeatedly slaughtering sentient animals over and over again. Communities where a new slaughter house is built see crime rates sky rocket- likely due to either mental health issues or harmful adaptation (i.e. shutting down your sensitivity or compassion in order to carry out your job). We should shut down all slaughter houses and if you want to eat meat you can kill the animal yourself. Obviously, I also think we should be limited to 1 meat meal a week at most. Ideally none but I could live with once a month or once a year.	UCj4ykhzEXvl2d70sm7JLPqQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj4ykhzEXvl2d70sm7JLPqQ	0

And it&#39;s the only way there will ever be real peace on earth, because how we treat our animals is how we treat each other.

Even if my beans come in a plastic bag, I'm pretty sure their equivalent would be a plastic-packaged piece of meat which would absolutely have a higher carbon footprint per gram of protein provided. My view on this is that, yes, we need to change the way we think of food packaging and move toward a reusable system but that has very little to do with what diet you're following for the vast majority of people. From vegetables to chicken nuggets, most of our food comes in unnecessary packaging that will outlive us all. Just because a vegan diet isn't perfect, does not mean it should be discounted as the worst thing that can happen is you save a lot of lives, and the best is that you also make a huge dent in the climate crisis.

I get that videos like this want to appeal to a broad base but it feels a little patronizing to not give a full and clear picture. Also, for the purpose of climate equality I'm a big believer that those of us in western, economically stable parts of the world (especially those of us who have money and live in cities with a lot of choice) have a duty to do the hardest work and simply reducing your meat intake doesn't seem hard enough when developing nations are simply going through the economic booms we've been through already. I hear so often that there's some locally farmed alternative, or it's okay if we go fishing once a week but honestly, is that reasonable and more importantly, do many people actually live like this? I live on an island where I'm never more than 72 miles away from the sea and yet I've only known one person in my life who actually fishes their own food and the last time I saw him, he'd gone vegan.

But I don't think that this will help the environment. https://www.activesustainability.com/climate-change/100-companies-responsible-71-ghg-emissions/ Just 100 companies are responsible for 71% of greenhouse gas emission, most of them are from big oil and energy industries. Changing to veganism wouldn't do diddly squat to the environment. Go ahead, preach the health benefits of going vegan, but it's not going to put a dent in the overall greenhouse gas emissions.

If that's the case then let me introduce you to a little something called supply and demand. In the short term, yes, there might be a few more cows that are left grazing but seeing how the demand for meat has decreased, farmers would not raise as many cows to reduce their losses. The farmers don't want to lose their money in raising so many cows only to have them not be eaten. So in the long run, it would benefit the environment:)	UC9GelYLVeA6fU5CQTbQLxIg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9GelYLVeA6fU5CQTbQLxIg	1	Ugwlx7CvZnM8PIaAMsR4AaABAg	Emily Rhinier

I don't know where you got that from, but farming legumes produce no where near as much greenhouse gasses as farming cows. You also have to feed livestock enormous amounts of plants which are grown industrially and harm the environment through massive use of water, land and food, GH gas emissions, soil degradation, water pollution, etc. Vegan is truly the way to go if you want to help the Earth and also eating locally can help too.

The research I’ve seen actually shows a huge difference between a vegetarian and vegan diet. The cows used to produce dairy are the same ones used to produce meat, so you’re supporting the same industry when you eat dairy, just to a lesser extent. And research I’ve seen also says that animal agriculture is much worse than this video suggests. 14% of emissions is actually the lowest figure I’ve seen. Something around 50% is more accurate. Good message nonetheless.	UCdp88RL_3ZEGQf7335lqZ_w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdp88RL_3ZEGQf7335lqZ_w	0

If the cows aren't to be slaughtered either but kept purely for the purpose of dairy production their lives would probably be extended by a large margin too.

The first one gives the numbers with respect to a questionnaire of food choices while the second one actually recorded the daily habits of the subjects for a period of 7 days. "The age-and-sex-adjusted mean (95 % confidence interval) GHG emissions in kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalents per day (kgCO2e/day) were 7.19 (7.16, 7.22) for high meat-eaters ( > = 100 g/d), 5.63 (5.61, 5.65) for medium meat-eaters (50-99 g/d), 4.67 (4.65, 4.70) for low meat-eaters ( < 50 g/d), 3.91 (3.88, 3.94) for fish-eaters, 3.81 (3.79, 3.83) for vegetarians and 2.89 (2.83, 2.94) for vegans." https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4372775/ "The omnivorous choice generated worse carbon, water and ecological footprints than other diets. No differences were found for the environmental impacts of ovo-lacto-vegetarians and vegans, which also had diets more adherent to the Mediterranean pattern. A high inter-individual variability was observed through principal component analysis, showing that some vegetarians and vegans have higher environmental impacts than those of some omnivores. Thus, regardless of the environmental benefits of plant-based diets, there is a need for thinking in terms of individual dietary habits." https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-06466-8	UCz1dOXuh2qsLlShx6olV24g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz1dOXuh2qsLlShx6olV24g	1	UgxosrYhcsBIoyUBYrp4AaABAg	Ana Hoppus

Totally organic, no chemical fertilizer and on a small scale. Large scale cropping is exposing the earth to the sun and air and not only does it not trap and process gases, exposed earth also releases the natural gases contained in the earth.

It&#39;s like consuming alcohol or smoking cigarettes every once in awhile. Why not commit and be consistent with your choices? Of course I think people should take it slowly if they need to and make changes that will be sustainable but veganism should be the ultimate goal, in my opinion.

And thieves would still roam our streets trying to mug old ladies. But the reality, things would be better as MORE people went vegan. Reduced medical costs, due to reduced cancer rates, diabetes, heart disease & obesity. LESS land being used for animal Ag, meaning LESS deforestation and LESS fert run off, including LESS dead zones in the ocean. And there would be much LESS CO2 emissions. That's a fact.

But to suggest that chicken, milk and eggs should be included in the diet for health reasons is ridiculous. Sure, chicken might be better than beef. And eggs might be better than bacon. But NONE of those products lead to optimal health. Science and medical literature are in complete agreement that reducing saturated fat and cholesterol intake results in the best health outcomes. You can't produce any credible research that will prove otherwise.	UCLXMX1C0SZBzyv4KkCOpYxg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLXMX1C0SZBzyv4KkCOpYxg	1	UgzBQ6roF9pbAUIhpyB4AaABAg	Bruna Reivax

YOU are the one who hasn't done the actual math. First of all *Cargo Ships* vs *Airplanes* is a HUGE difference! Don't conflate those two completely different methods of transport. A floating ship uses way less energy than a flying plane. Shame on you for not understanding the difference. 77% of agricultural land is used for livestock. But it only yields 17% of our dietary calories! The math has been done by many, many researchers and the facts are the facts. Deal with it! *ourworldindata . org/is-organic-agriculture-better-for-the-environment* FYI - Beef ≠ Eggs when it comes to environmental impact. They are on two opposite ends of the spectrum. But good luck relying on eggs as a source of calories! Two eggs EXCEEDS the entire daily recommended maximum for dietary cholesterol. I find it odd though. Do you think eating a vegan diet means living off of bananas, mangoes, chia seeds and avocados? A vegan doesn't have to eat ANY of those foods if they don't want to! Meanwhile, plenty of meat eaters also eat those foods ALONG WITH THEIR 16oz STEAK!!!!!

I actually developed copper toxicity from my copper IUD birth control device, it gave me super long heavy periods.... I couldn’t fathom at the time giving up meat bc I craved it SO much. So I really detest any shaming of anyone for personal dietary choices bc you and even they might not know all that is driving them and the body has an intelligence of its own if we listen and try to give in to the healthier cravings, it does indicate what it wants or needs it’s a matter of interpreting it well.... but since I’ve sorted that out and I cleansed from heavy metal and I pumped lots of good minerals to make up for being depleted for so long- now it is much easier for me to eat even less meat. I do tend to stick to a Mediterranean diet, heavy on protein but not all animal sources, I go for fish and chicken (I also like to eat LOW on the seafood food chain, bc predatory fish at the top are both A. Overfished and B. Loaded with heavy metals, and I’d rather have oysters or lobster over tuna or swordfish any day) , rice &amp; beans, veggies &amp; greens, and only crave red meat about once a month anyway. I do still consume dairy like eggs, butter &amp; milk. But I try to stick to organic and local as well. I really enjoy and love food and eat a lot, I graze all day, I consider it a worthwhile investment in my own long term health. I don’t feel guilty about an $8 green juice from Whole Foods that has fresh dandelion greens &amp; burdock root to help cleanse my liver so it can do its job cleansing toxins from my body and keeping me healthier :P <br />One of the coolest meat operations I’ve come across is Wild Idea Buffalo Co out of South Dakota what they do is amazing check it out- also the most lean, tender amazing steak you’ll ever eat in your life!

When we grow crops we till the earth and that releases massive amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere so a vegan diet can have great effects on the environment. On the other hand a pasture where that grass feed cow is being grazed can sequester carbon and use methane for plant growth even if those animals produce those elements at the same the same time. Please don&#39;t simplify this equation too much! Nature has been managing itself for billions of years before we came along so don&#39;t think we can solve things by getting rid of meat, livestock just might be an essential part of the equation that fixes climate change.

I think that local hunting makes sense when it&#39;s about population control and also a more humane way of killing animals while using more of the body for different purposes. I would love to see the artificial meat grown from cells kick off because that would greatly help the climate and animal abuse issue, hopefully the global food shortage as well. There will always be people who don&#39;t want to eat vegan or vegetarian and that&#39;s okay, finding a long term solution that&#39;s kind to our planet and animals is great though.

Cause the meat just ends up going bad and gets thrown away. And the farms will still keep producing the same amount consistently. Not trying to be rude or saying that I’m against better diets, just trying to understand how switching could help in that sense.

If the demand shrinks due to people switching to a different diet, then the grocer has price changes which increases demand for the rest of the people who still want to eat meat and the market returns back to its original consumption rate.

The amount of water and resources wasted on animal agriculture is criminal and could be used for human beings. We should not be eating from the ocean at all. It is not in a healthy state, and we are just making it worse. Renowned Marine biologist Sylvia Earle explains why eating fish is destroying the ocean and why she doesn&#39;t eat fish here: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/world-on-a-plate/2014/sep/18/sylvia-earle-overfishing-seafood-ocean-hope-spots">https://www.theguardian.com/environment/world-on-a-plate/2014/sep/18/sylvia-earle-overfishing-seafood-ocean-hope-spots</a>. We either have to change or our tastebuds and greed will be what destroys us and our planet. We really do have to go vegan is we want to fight climate change FOR REAL! and make the world a better place :)	UCS9K8RNsYBceIHx2v83Gtfg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS9K8RNsYBceIHx2v83Gtfg	0

I do understand there are places in the world where knowledge of veganism is inaccessible or hard to do because of resources. But I’m talking about the average person with access to a computer and supermarket. <br /><br />The only excuses you have to eat meat are that it’s convenient, tastes good or is culturally promoted. We all know what the right decision is so don’t kid yourself if you try to justify a meat diet. From the very point of causing unnecessary suffering to sentient animals, that alone is reason enough.

UgworpDQ-lo9UB8aTgV4AaABAg	0	0	2018-01-10 04:41:21	Stephanie Holbrook	It’s true that livestock emit methane and nearly all aspects of agriculture have a carbon footprint; however, U.S. animal agriculture is much more efficient than in other parts of the world. In the U.S., livestock are responsible for 3.8 percent of GHG emissions while transportation accounts for 26.4 percent, according to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency data. In California, 5.4 percent of GHG emissions are attributed to livestock and 37 percent to transportation, according to the California Air Resources Board.While it is vital that scientists in UC ANR, and elsewhere, assist ranchers to continue diminishing the carbon hoofprint, it is also important to recognize that meat can serve as a high-quality protein source as part of a nutritious diet. The VOX video does note that not all livestock is raised equally, and that rangeland can be used to sequester carbon, but it neglects to mention that grazing cows also provide numerous ecosystem services, such as eating plants that could fuel <a href="http://wildfires.it/">wildfires.It</a> should also be noted how livestock fit into the larger food system picture. Almost 60 percent of the world&#39;s agricultural land is grazing land and is unsuitable for producing crops. Ruminants serve a valuable role in the food system by converting the forages humans cannot consume into a nutrient-dense food.UC ANR advisors and specialists continuously strive to improve livestock production practices; however, that is only one of many approaches we need to pursue to solve the challenges of climate change. Time, research and money should be invested where they will produce the most benefit for society. Encouraging people to focus on livestock, rather than on much larger sources of GHG emissions, can lead to policies that slow our efforts to develop more effective climate change solutions.&quot;	UCKM3BLEjwjcQ4mQD6dZw6UA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKM3BLEjwjcQ4mQD6dZw6UA	0

Obviously meat eating is so engrained within our society, and not everyone is going to change overnight. When people become frustrated with the lack of change, without looking at the plethora of change that has already taken place, not only does it undermine the people that have been eating vegan etc for years already.. but it also pushes away those that are finding it harder to change their identity in the midst of this and that will only cause negative repercussions for the environment and animals when you see people rejecting the notion of veganism because they don’t feel welcomed to the idea, but rather pushed away for being a “meat-eater” etc.	UC2wb5LM-9UhQSB2boxYKBew	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2wb5LM-9UhQSB2boxYKBew	1	Ugwx9vQeE3TXublGtb14AaABAg	Angelina

I&#39;m personally a vegetarian for a lot of reasons, the environment being one, but I recognize that as I didn&#39;t like meat much in the first place it wasn&#39;t that big a sacrifice for me. Instead of encouraging people to give up meat entirely, I try to show people that not every meal HAS to involve meat to be satisfying and delicious. I think that mentality&#39;s harmful, and  I think gentle dialogue like this is a good way to make some progress.

Simple as that. Our society is brainwashed by getting &quot;protein&quot; this &quot;protein&quot; that. Our body doesn&#39;t need that much protein unless you&#39;re a body builder. You can get fat and cholesterol free protein from beans for example. <br />I never said totally abstain from meats. But lesser you eat, the more proud you should be, since you are helping the planet to thrive and your future generations will appreciate you from burning less carbon towards global warming.

I’m going to try to not come off as a crazy vegan who’s trying to make everyone vegan (I feel like people are entitled to their own decision despite what I morally feel) but all of what I’m about to say is backed by science. There is so much Co2 in the atmosphere that we can no long plant enough trees to save us. Animal farming is responsible for 60% of gas emissions for animal agriculture which is killing the planet. Besides that, our bodies are not made to consume meat: Heart disease, diabetes (yes diabetes can be from consumption of meat), cancer and other harmful diseases and fatal conditions can be reduced and come to an end if the consumption of meat is either reduced or illuminated. Another example is the evolution of human teeth. Our canines are very small and we no longer need or molars/wisdom’s due to us not consuming meat the way early humans did. Overall, humans have been consuming animal product for an extremely long time and there’s no excuse for people who say that there are no options in the vegan lifestyle. From this, humans could not simply just stop all together due to that not being realistic; we would have to gradually reduce the intake of meat/ animal products but for the people that would be more into just trying it out for a day, go for it. There’s even a thing called the Seven Day Vegan Challenge which is great because you can see what works for you and you don’t have to commit to it unles you feel like this lifestyle is for you.(if you do try this please don’t snackand just not eat. Once again there are PLENTY of options out there. By the end of the week you will feel a lot better) Simply just eating cleaner and healthier would do so much for our planet and our race, the HUMAN RACE.

They also never mention how bad eating seafood is for the environment. Fishers use huge nets that capture anything including dolphins and sharks. 40% of what they capture is unintentional and dies as a result. Scientists estimate that the oceans may be completely fish less in 40 years. I’m going to stay vegan for ethical reasons above all but you can’t argue against the environmental impact. I need to be vegan to balance out the majority of people who are going to keep eating everything in moderation which is just the standard American diet	UChxcpQZQ123BoL6bKWQaWDg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UChxcpQZQ123BoL6bKWQaWDg	0

Animal agriculture is responsible for 90% of rainforest destruction already. This is exactly why we have industrial farms, there is not enough space to breed all these animals into flesh. I think we should just shy away from beef and try less resourceful sources of protein such as beans, lentils, soy, grains, veg meat products etc. Plants only need water and sun and contain great amounts of protein and other nutrients for us humans to use.

They're foregut fermenters, and the process of methanogenesis in their rumen is what creates CH4 like with any other ruminant including bison, elk, sheep, impala, etc. Methanogens in the rumen produce CH4. So enteric methane is more "burps" than "farts." That enteric methane also has a context, so like with any source of CH4 emissions you have to look at the entire ecosystem not just GROSS emissions...You have to look at NET emissions instead. Net emissions account for CH4 sinks as well. These sinks include geospehric sinks like methanotrophic bacteria in the soil, and tropospheric sinks likehydroxyl radicals in the atmosphere. In fact, most CH4 is oxidized, and CH4 in general is short lived so it doesn't accumulate as much as CO2, this is why the whole notion of CO2 equivalency is being re-evaluated - Read: https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/news/2018_news_Climate_Pollutants_GWP I go into this all in a lot more detail here in this blog entry: Ruminations: Methane math and context https://lachefnet.wordpress.com/2018/05/04/ruminations-methane-math-and-context ###	UCaPCYyWUqyQ3FGKvPbAEXmg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaPCYyWUqyQ3FGKvPbAEXmg	1	UgzYAFH4_7TkiGJAutF4AaABAg	TvGunslingeRvT

It is a waste of time and effort to try to convince people to change their habits because of your supposed &quot;facts&quot; surrounding an issue. There are over 7 billion of us on earth today, but there were less than 1 billion people 100 years ago. We did not, and could not sustain this intense population growth and development by eating vegetables alone. Meat, makes people &quot;feel full&quot; quicker, and stay feeling satisfied much longer than a meal of vegetables. People act and form habits on feelings and emotions, not from cold hard facts. I am all for responsible choices and reversing our contribution to climate change, but anyone who thinks the answer to this problem is simply telling people to eat less meat, is blinded by naivety.

If the current population reduces how much meat they consume but the population grows, we´re effectively going to be consuming close to the same amount of meat in a few decades from now. Telling everyone to simply eat less meat is an okay solution if there was a finite number of people, but there isn´t a finite number of people.

Our personal decisions are not driven primarily by ethics, but by appetites and urges, especially when it comes to food. The only way to make a meaningful dent in the contributions of animal agriculture to greenhouse gas emissions is to change public policies that make meat relatively more expensive and less profitable relative to vegetable agriculture. Unless the governments of the world start taking sustainability seriously, make no mistake, our species will wipe itself out. It is hopelessly naive to trust that appeals to some kind of innate human goodness are sufficient to curtail the destructive effects of the human swarm&#39;s natural appetite for meat, or our other selfish impulses for that matter. People will alter their habits when they are forced to do so, and not a moment sooner.	UCCl_CsrfO7QbHSev2zTTVFA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCl_CsrfO7QbHSev2zTTVFA	0

I also have heard, however, that the evidence that <b>everyone</b> switching to a no-meat diet would be best for the environment is not exactly foolproof. Animals graze and make use of land which we could never use directly for food (e.g., cows in certain pastures eat grass that I could never eat), and so their presence in the food ecosystem can help eliminate inefficiencies. Some folks accordingly argue that the ecological ideal wouldn&#39;t involve removing animals completely from the food ecosystem. I would be interested in hearing more about that part of the discussion, too.	UCxS83h_FpvpIhXzvwGFLeEA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxS83h_FpvpIhXzvwGFLeEA	0

How come you guys ignored the impact of meat production on oceans, rivers, soils etc? How can you guys advocate for do less harm when you clearly present an option that is the most impactful and can be pursued by anyone. Saying to eat less meat as a step forward I could get but saying you don&#39;t need to go vegan with the catastrophic scenario the is going through sounds ludicrous. You guys end up discouraging people from going 100% vegan because of taste buds over environment, health, animals ethic etc. First Vox video Im actually disappointed with.

It takes a lot of mining and a lot of CO2 to produce those solar panels. Batteries are also terrible for the environment, and all of these "renewable" energy sources require solar panels to store the energy. Plus, none of that stuff works in places like Canada, where it gets so cold in the winter that batteries freeze and lose efficiency, and there's very little sun. There's a funny picture of a wind turbine frozen solid, and a helicopter is being used to unfreeze it, burning all kinds of fossil fuels just to unfreeze this wind turbine. Even if we switch to 100% renewable energy, we will always need fossil fuels as an emergency backup. Germany went renewable, and it actually increased their use of coal, because they needed more and more "backup" systems. Just use fossil fuels like a normal person.

There&#39;s a coulpe of things I didn&#39;t like, and I&#39;d like to clarify for those people who really want to be careful about their impact : first of all, &quot;mediterranean diet&quot; doesn&#39;t mean much, it doesn&#39;t have a strict definition ( trust me, I&#39;m Italian, and I know we can do much better than today), so telling people &quot;start eating mediterranean&quot; might be misleading, it&#39;s not much different from saying &quot;reduce your beef consumption&quot;, even though it sounds cool. <br /><br />More importantly, the video gives us the feeling that a certain food is always better than another ( fish better than meat, veggies better than fish). However one must know that there&#39;s a huge difference between some different kind of fish, ( salmon, which is shown in the video, is actually one of the most CO2-intense, you&#39;d better go for some small fish like makerel or harrings if you want to help the planet).<br />And remember that the kind of food you eat is not the only thing that matters, you have to consider where it comes from and how it was produced. For example, a mango is a fruit, but if it has to be shipped by plane to come to your table, it might be enviromentally worse than meat.<br /><br />Here&#39;s my video about the topic, you can also find nice references to scientific literature in the video description.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9xGPP2utr4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9xGPP2utr4</a>	UCCZdnarLDN5QTeRzagZxqVA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCZdnarLDN5QTeRzagZxqVA	0

But the producers/farmers of the meat products are not going to stop farming and raising animals (which over all what is causing the pollution) so what is the point? If the animal is already dead and packed up, then NOT eating it is not going to solve anything. It&#39;s like saying using less paper will save trees, but the paper is already made. By not eating or consuming, then it will just get thrown out which is a waste overall of life and resources.

Eat less meat, recycle, etc. – it all helps, but NOT NEARLY ENOUGH. The 25 biggest industrial polluters emitted over 50% of the industrial green house gases since 1988 (Source: CDP Carbon Majors report 2017). Regulating them will have a much bigger positive (and lasting!) effect than changing the diet of millions of people. But it takes collective action and a lot of pressure on shareholders and politicians (especially in the US with it&#39;s broken campaign finance system).

All consumer choice does. If people have the ability to purchase from more ethical companies it changes culture (albeit slowly). I do agree that there needs to be more regulation. But the stance of 'but im not as bad as them' is kind of a cop out if you have the abilty act. That said i understand the pressure of capitalism is hard and is overbearing, but people can do help affect change. The world hasn't always been the way it is now.

It's the greedy rich CEOs of companies that dump their waste in poor communities because they know that they'll be able to protect themselves from any of the negative effects. They can afford to not care about the consequences of their actions, which is scary since they hold so much power and social capital. Those are the main ones we need to focus on fighting and holding accountable.

What we need to be concerned about is the way it harms the lives of human beings and animals. And this idea that we should just all lay down and die in order to save the planet is really toxic and unhelpful. We need to have compassion for each other and for ourselves.

We’re no different , plus I think people would be furiously angry if let’s say all countries made having children illegal. What the earth needs is another extinction event in order to start fresh. Can’t think of many ways that human numbers will be brought down. There’s also the trouble of bees going extinct due to various factors , if they do the vast majority of our crops will cease to exist , about 1/3 of the food we eat is reliant on plant crops. The only crops we’d be able to grow would be corn , rice , and grain. So in about 3-4 our food supply that we already have stored would likely start to run out and things are going to go south.

So no leather or silk or milk or cheese. If an non human animal made it. Its a NO go. Vegetarianism is simply no animal flesh. So, silk or honey, or milk may be acceptable. There are some wiggle room on this definitions as people have little different rules for themselves, but broadly this is pretty close. Hope this helps!

They're foregut fermenters, and the process of methanogenesis in their rumen is what creates CH4 like with any other ruminant including bison, elk, sheep, impala, etc. Methanogens in the rumen produce CH4. So enteric methane is more "burps" than "farts." That enteric methane also has a context, so like with any source of CH4 emissions you have to look at the entire ecosystem not just GROSS emissions...You have to look at NET emissions instead. Net emissions account for CH4 sinks as well. These sinks include geospehric sinks like methanotrophic bacteria in the soil, and tropospheric sinks likehydroxyl radicals in the atmosphere. In fact, most CH4 is oxidized, and CH4 in general is short lived so it doesn't accumulate as much as CO2, this is why the whole notion of CO2 equivalency is being re-evaluated - Read: https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/news/2018_news_Climate_Pollutants_GWP I go into this all in a lot more detail here in this blog entry: Ruminations: Methane math and context https://lachefnet.wordpress.com/2018/05/04/ruminations-methane-math-and-context ###	UCaPCYyWUqyQ3FGKvPbAEXmg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaPCYyWUqyQ3FGKvPbAEXmg	1	UgwjT_VwQ9rLQ_oPfyl4AaABAg	Faebelina

It's true and all but because so many different kinds of meats and fruits exist it's extremely difficult to cut out the major of parts of the food table for everyone on the planet. I mean technically buying less food overall would do one better, but then you run into malnorishment.

Although it is partially a population problem, the reality is that the top 20% of the world is the main cause of the problems and have more power than anyone to change it.

In my transition journey I&#39;ve found great substitutes for any animal product I was craving 🕉 there are so many great vegan products out there. I had a salad for dinner last night. I&#39;m a raw vegan because I’ve found it to be the optimal diet for me for many reasons. I&#39;ve gotten blood work done and was told I am at optimal health for a male my age. I was also told I am not deficient in any nutrients. To be honest, even though I did my research and prepared for this lifestyle, I was somewhat surprised and relieved to hear the good news.

First of all it&#39;s not &quot;vegan&quot; to merely be on a plant based diet. It&#39;s more ethical and ruminative. Secondly, this video directly tells you how destructive it is to be a non-vegan for the planet and your health, it doesn&#39;t prove how is vegetarianism perpetuates the industry that is responsible for meat, i.e. meat industry. Dairy is directly linked to facilitating that which is responsible for limitless cruelty and destruction of this planet&#39;s resources then how can being vegetarian be good thing? The &quot;relative&quot; approach is complete and utter delusion. I don&#39;t want to sound all crude but a vegetarian is responsible for as much cruelty and destruction as a meat eater.

Oil has been buried with millions of years so digging it up will flood the atmosphere with CO2. If we have less food there will be less plants to absorb carbon, and the CO2 in the atmosphere won&#39;t decrease because of plants.

Or do you want to be the most right person in the Youtube comment section? Ideally yes, everyone in the world should be vegan if their health and income allows it, for both ethical and environmental reasons. However, the jump from vegetarian to vegan, nevermind from a standard American diet, is a drastic life change for most. It's re-learning a basic daily function and it won't happen overnight. People who are considering this change are put off by militant vegans on the internet with their all-or-nothing stances on diet and ethics. It makes the changes seem insurmountable. Whereas promoting at least a reduction in meat and animal product intake will help the environment immensely and reduce animal suffering. Be reasonable, logical, sympathetic, and solution oriented. In the future we will likely all be vegan, but change does not happen overnight.

You (americans) really don&#39;t know anymore how to eat balanced and healthy? Wow, thats tragic. Also, I agree with you, when people want meat everytime for lunch, thats not normal. Even going further, Breakfast, lunch and dinner are completly ballocks and they encourage unhealthy bhvr. It seems like noone listens to their bodies. Eat when you are hungry, Eat you crave for, your body is amazing a telling you want you need. If you crave for something salty, chances are that you are running low on salt and minerals in your body.

You give a bold statement without backing it up. I call ballocks on this. Also, meat consumption is a crtical part of ones diet, because the human body adepted through hundres and thousands of years to digest animal proteins. We aren`t as good at digesting plants. Also, the meat consumption per person is on a all-time low. In the StoneAge one human had the quadruple intake of meat.<br />Also, there is a fundemental flaw in your whole video. When a plant grows, it takes CO2 in and it KEEPS(!) the carbon. Thats why they produce Oxygen. And that&#39;s what we feed on.

(I don&#39;t entirely understand how this works so if you have any ideas I&#39;m interested). It is an imperative of capitalism&#39;s ideology to maximize profit and cultivate anything that will lead to it, it seems, and often ruthlessly. The truth is displacing culpability to small scale individual choices in consuming is unlikely to actually effect systemic production(?) How many billions of individuals are there in the consuming developed world? ( The problem isn&#39;t the cooking of meat, but the processes that go into its growth - i.e. it will already be there before it is purchased).

Farm raised fish are probably you best option for substantial food source. The biggest issue is water. But the feed can be plant base or if the fish out omnivorous they can eat algae/aquatic weeds that occur naturally plus fish feed. The fish themselves aren’t injected with hormones like chicken has been found to be. And as long as they are care for properly the risk of the fish having diseases are slim. Most seafood related illnesses are bc of undercook meat or in the case of oyster there caught out of season or just not frozen fast enough to kill the vibrio. My recommendation is that if you are buying fish check if it was farmed raised or not, if yes see where the farm is located. In my experience most Americans fish farms are under strict guidelines from how the fish is raised to how they harvest, packaged, and shipped out. So really just be aware my dude where your buying from.	UCgTklrguZTAqHZy5mftC-sg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgTklrguZTAqHZy5mftC-sg	1	Ugyj0jUSwvvKv3D1Drp4AaABAg	ads

Replacing butter with healthy fats such as olive oil and canola oil. Using herbs and spices instead of salt to flavor foods. Limiting red meat to no more than a few times a month.

Whole Foods in some places I heard partnered with them and tries to adhere to its guidelines but I don’t know how diligent they are about it- as consumers if we all put pressure on them and make calls or write in suggestions or feedback or complaints- they should get the message and respond. But individually that is a great mention- the Seafood Watch is a helpful tool to let you know what’s better or worse. There’s issues with farming but.... it can also be done better or worse so I guess I support best practices in farmed fisheries.... personally I generally stick to Salmon either wild or farmed.... I tend to stay away from Tuna or Swordfish, or any other large predatory fishes or endangered animals- especially sharks!!! I favor Salmon, Oysters, and love Lobster and crab too. I’m really content to just stick with that and never really crave anything else. Although Uni fresh sea urchin is amazing, like an Ocean mousse, and eel is also really yummy, so I just tend to love the little guys on the foodchain :) and they tend to be more plentiful.... but a problem is bottom Trawling, and by-catch - so the method of fishing is important. Crabs here in California tend to be caught by smallish traps- near the cost where big boats can’t go. It’s very regulated. So I feel good about eating crab. Oysters are generally “farmed” or cultivated and tended to in their own natural cove environments.... I’m sure it has some impact but I’m not concerned about it being really harmful. Least of my worries. In fact, Hog Island Oyster Co was recently mentioned on NPR for being a canary in the coal mine- sounding the alarm that yes the oceans are becoming too acidic due to sinking carbon from the atmosphere for us- but shelled organisms are pretty much doomed .... the ocean will be too acidic for them to grow their shells- and they’ll just die off and we will have no more Oysters- no more shellfish- which is also going to be a problem for the rest of the whole ocean ecosystem- no more plankton with their tiny exoskeletons.... that’s Whale Food.... that means the Whales will die. Hot Island Oyster Co is working on ways to save their own business of course - they have found that sea plants take carbon out of the ocean just like land plants take it out of the air. So they are planting more sea kelp and sea grass for their oysters, and THOSE oysters get to enjoy a little micro-biome or microclimate that is less acidic and allows them to live. So.... I will definitely still be eating my oysters and have to pay Hog Island a visit :) Who really wants to live in a world without Whales???? :( It is definitely worth eating responsibly for. Our choices even the little ones DO matter and add up. Rice & Beans, farm fresh eggs.... some seafood.... Mediterranean is a great way to go.

Do the industry smokes go to the ozone layer&quot; and stay there??? Impossible, man! the industries could produce poisonous gases .....or chemicals......or you name those products, of course, but, they don&#39;t go much up to space, they just remain around the earth, and on the earth surfaces for a while. Every thing in the air is destroyed by itself over time.<br />Like clouds are destroyed and like evaporated waters are destroyed, over time other gases are destroyed over time. <br />Of course the industry products cause environmental problem.....But, that doesn&#39;t mean that there is a sphere called ozone layer where such bad industrial gases are stored, because that is not just natural, that is not possible.

In the north they eat much more animal fat, lard and butter. In Spain you eat a lot of meat. So what do you mean by &quot;Mediterranean diet&quot;?

But if we all follow this rule nothing can change - if everyone continues to buy products to save waste, because the animal is already dead by the time we see it, then this only serves to confirm to the industry killing and distributing it that there is still a demand for their product. They don't know the reasons why they only see the sales figures, and so the cycle continues.

Today, everything's automated, even worse, a behind a desk job. When you labor, you burn calories, your muscles are getting a workout. I don't think today's Americans do that level of labor as the founders of America.

Of course there are many problems to tackle. But I would not argue against the general idea of "both the health of Americans and the environment would benefit from Americans eating less meat".

I conducted blood labs before, during, and after my experience. All health markers improved, including a fantastic reduction in total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL. HDL went up. Interesting. The likely reason is that I was in caloric deficit and cut bodyfat during this period. Although I shifted from a grains and higher carbohydrate fruit/veggie diet to a diet much higher in fat (including saturated fats), my lipid profile improved significantly. My experience is N=1, however it is a valid anecdote. BTW, there is fantastic emerging research in the role our digestive microbiome has with overall health, as well as more current research in the effect of mono, poly, unsaturated as well as saturated fats on health, and the modern research continues to swim against the tide of the older body of literature.

Americans also eat a diet very high in inexpensive, calorie dense and nutrient poor snack and junk foods. Go to a grocery store and you typically see grocery carts with more fried chips, cookies, cheap frozen meals, rather than fresh vegetables, dairy, and quality cuts of meat and fish. Much of the meat eaten is via fast food, which is also laden with low quality fats, sodium, and low quality meats, as well as lacking in soluble and insoluble fibers. The issue is FAR more complex than stating "Americans eat more meat per capita and are obese, therefore meat is bad". That is a non-valid argument and is merely correlation.

It's often much easier for people to believe someone's testimony as opposed to understanding complex data and variation across a continuum. Quantitative scientific measures are almost always more accurate than personal perceptions and experiences, but our inclination is to believe that which is tangible to us, and/or the word of someone we trust over a more 'abstract' statistical reality. Example: Jason said that that was all cool and everything, but his grandfather smoked, like, 30 cigarettes a day and lived until 97 - so don't believe everything you read about meta analyses of methodologically sound studies showing proven causal relationships. Americans eat the most meat, are the most obese, and mostly die from heart and weight related diseases.

You could have switched to lean, grass fed meat or game meat & the SAME junk food changes you made & the result would have been identical in terms of your weight/health. Anytime I want to loose weight, I simply trade out grains for lean meat & watch the kios fall off. I just maintain that until I get my weight back where I want to & then slowly reintroduce grains to replace meat until I hit a balance where my weight has stopped falling. tbh, the ONLY time I put on weight is if I'm short on money & reduce the meat in my diet as a result. & my cholesterol is low & my BP is on the low side but acceptable	UCZsUD6fbggZVj-l6XcBrPdw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZsUD6fbggZVj-l6XcBrPdw	1	UgxbZSqwmZP_K4639zx4AaABAg	freshbingo

Yeah, going vegan I had to give up cheetos. But I can still have coke and oreos. So I generally have more plant based diet, and I have less options for junk food, so I eat less of it. But I still have plenty of junk food. As for meat replacements, tofu, tempeh, seitan, mushroom, lentils, they are always lower in calories, fat, and cholesterol than meat, especially processed meat. Simply put, I just eat less calories now because my substitutions are less calorically dense. But I still eat crap now and then; I'm still a human with cravings. It's pretty great.

Like the carbon footprint of all the vegetables combines to equal the calorie intake and minerals of a meat only diet and the carbon footprint of that meat only diet. Also I don&#39;t believe the carbon footprint is accurately reflected in the video. Because you have hauling the products from field, to processing to manufacturing to distribution to stores and then home. A single semi doing all that work greatly exceeds your numbers.

Not to mention the idiototic children you see on the comments of butchering videos that say &quot;Mm they&#39;re crying and suffering make my hamburgers even better&quot;. As funny as they believe themselves to be, they&#39;ll never change. Even people who don&#39;t think twice about climate change or the suffering animals and live in their own little world. Where if nothing harms them now, how could they change their lives for the benefit of others? Humans are selfish creatures. I mean its not even about telling people anymore. Its just talking to a brick wall, but even a brick wall has a bigger IQ than that kid behind the screen poking fun at the suffering of other creatures. I do like to think positively about wanting to be vegan. I mean recently 400,000+ less animals were killed the past decade due to veganism. It just digusts me that people are so naive. So simple minded and one sided that they cant even change something that will never even benefit them. Addiction is that cause. Just look at white people. With their hunting and meaningless slaughter of animals. While deer isn&#39;t a big part of climate change, I&#39;m talking about the people who do hunt. Its because they hunt that they don&#39;t care about any other animals besides their dog. They&#39;ll devour any cooked carcass in sight. Unaware of the tons of negatives there are to even consume meat. Meat, dairy products, GMOs, and artificial preservatives are all sources of cancer, obesity, and addiction. Of course there aren&#39;t enough people who even know that because the industries are purposely wanting you to get cancer one day. Population control. Also they want money of course. They couldnt care less about you. If that wasn&#39;t true then why do the biggest industries of meat consumption pretty shove their advertising down everyones throat? Do you see vegetable and vegan meals advertised? Of course not. Anyways, in my opinion, this world is done for as it is. I mean, look who&#39;s president for god&#39;s sake. No one will change and no one will care, but every person who does is obviously helping tremendously already. They&#39;re not selfish unlike a majority of our species. If you&#39;re offended by this, take it up with someone who cares. If not, spread the word. Help the world. Help all sentient beings that we share this earth with. If not for them, for the people you love then. Climate change affects everyone. This is as real as the phone or computer in your face. So you decide. Decide fast because time waits for no man. I repeat...<br />Time waits for no man.	UC59NL1MOcgyOCEbrmQrZ3LQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC59NL1MOcgyOCEbrmQrZ3LQ	0

How is hunting these innocent beings for population control any better than the US government slowly killing us off secretly with GMOs and what not? Sure they don't speak like humans do, but all life is equal and all life is precious. Taking their lives isn't the only solution to deal with the cause. The easiest sure. Are their lives worth any less just because they eat your crops and just because its the easiest way out? Yes they are human grown crops and do take a while and hard work to grow them, but these animals don't know that. They find food because they need to. There are other solutions. Their lives aren't worth it. Granted i don't expect you or others to find another solution in a matter of minutes, but anything else would be better than killing them off for the sake of ease. I can't say what because I don't live there. Its inhumane to move on with your day after 2 seconds of a bullet to the head of a sentient being. Desensitization is very inhumane. I'm not saying you're inhumane. I dont know you personally. Although, there are alot of people who don't think twice about the animals and nature around us.

It means that he's fitter than before. And that protein and carbohydrates are only found in meat is not true. Protein can also be found in eggs, walnuts, almonds, pecans, pumpkin seeds, tofu, seitan and Greek joghurt, for example, and carbohydrates can also be found in oatmeal, yams, brown rice, sweet potatoes, 100% whole wheat bread/pasta, beans, lentils, quinoa and couscous, for example. In fact, carbohydrates are pretty low, if at all, in meat.	UC7Net-rfvrwBQLNCH5OncEg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7Net-rfvrwBQLNCH5OncEg	1	UgxMIgqcVlK5XfxapyV4AaABAg	Amelie

The association with processed meat was similar to that observed for total meat [M3: β (95% CI) = 25 (15, 34), P < 0.0001]. The strongest association was shown for poultry [M3: β (95% CI) = 45 (29, 62), P < 0.0001]." oh & there was another group that put on more weight with meat too "In addition, the relation between red meat and weight gain was also stronger in physically active subjects compared with moderately inactive or inactive subjects" who would have thunk! People who go to the gym & work out lots add more muscle when they eat more meat lol This is interesting too "Meat intake was not significantly associated with weight gain in all centers with a negative average of the prudent pattern score (except Denmark and Norway)" "The strongest relation with annual weight change was observed for poultry. However, when subjects with previous illness and those likely to misreport their energy intake at baseline were excluded from the analyses, the association of weight gain with poultry was attenuated and the strongest association was observed for processed meat. This suggests that this result may be driven mainly by subjects with previous illness or weight-loss attempts that lead to diet intervention, as well as those who misreported their dietary intakes. Our results appear to contradict experimental studies that provide evidence of short-term increases in satiety and thermogenesis and decreased energy intake with high-protein diets (54). It has also been shown that obese subjects on a low-carbohydrate/high-protein diet lost more weight after 3 mo than did those on a conventional diet (11). However, results were not confirmed after 1 y of follow-up (11, 55). Furthermore, most of the intervention studies specifically on meat intake (21–26) did not find any weight change difference when energy from carbohydrates was partially substituted with meat (23–26). These differences could be linked to differences in the food substitutions performed as well as differences in the population's initial dietary habits. With control of energy intake for 9 wk, postmenopausal women who ate a diet supplemented with chicken (n = 15) lost significantly more body mass than did those supplemented with shortbread cookies and sugar-coated chocolates rich in carbohydrate and fat (n = 14) (21). All the other studies that substituted meat with healthier food such as soy products and legumes (23, 26), bread, pasta and rice (24), or fish, eggs, and cheese (25) did not find any significant weight-loss difference between the 2 interventions. In our study, the association between meat consumption and weight gain was weaker in subjects with a low prudent pattern score. Furthermore, meat intake was not significantly associated with weight gain in all centers with a negative average of the prudent pattern score (except Denmark and Norway), which indicates that the association could be diluted in populations with high consumptions of other high-energy-dense foods." So it appears that that study (with it's self reporting) confirms that eating lean unprocessed red meat as part of a healthy lifestyle, including reasonable exercise doesn't impact on weight in the majority of people, meanwhile those who switch from red meat to chicken are more likely to increase their weight, but all weight gains in the study were too low to be significant anyway. At least it's a reputably reported study - if you go to the actual study, that video is clearly a bunch of crap - given it doesn't even link to the study!

There was a recent video that compared bacon to lettuce & you should have heard them go off over it! Making it EXTREMELY clear that vegans do NOT eat lettuce, celery etc in the place of meat! They eat legumes or grains they said, hence why I stated "switch lean meat for non-meat alternatives" not some ridiculous rubbish of replacing calories with celery! Of course you loose weight if you drop calories! "we ate veggies and added a it of meat, now we eat a pound steak with 5 peas and 2 baby carrots" your American aren't you! Maybe you should try eating appropriate sized meals! No-one needs half a kilo of ANY food in one meal! That's half the day's recommended calories just in that one item!

I'm yet to see a single credible case where ANYONE has done NOTHING to their diet but switch lean meat for non-meat alternatives & actually loose weight or become healthier! EVERYTIME, without fail that you hear someone talk about "going vegan" & feeling healthier or loosing weight, they've ALWAYS made other changes to their diet. You can very easily google the other changes they've made, such as reducing/removing sugar & see countless reports from people making identical claims to those made people people who have removed sugar from their diet, but also removed meat at the same time & are crediting the meat for the change. It's got nothing to do with the meat removal! & unless you actually test this, you have no credibility claiming otherwise. Try a piece of grass fed lean beef (not the grain fed crap you get in America that would make anyone sick) & it will have no negative impacts on how you feel (unless you convince yourself otherwise of course, which I'm sure you will) Vegans are seriously worse than climate change deniers in the "facts" they convince themselves of!

I don’t need caffeine anymore, less acne, easier workout results, and a better, clearer mindset. I respect everyone’s choice because no two people think the same but I think everyone should at least try a vegan diet. There’s substitutes for any dairy or meat product and from a global perspectives it is so much more beneficial. I think with all the info out there we owe it to future generations to start making change. If anyone has any questions or needs advice, feel free to ask!

I totally understand your perspective and how cutting down trees for new land isn’t sustainable. I am however suggesting that instead of following the typical industrial holocaust that is the meat and dairy industry (where we feed and kill animals at an exponential rate) we use the resources towards the ever growing human population. It takes much more resources to feed and maintain a cow than a human so in that sense it would be way more efficient to just give people the resources directly as opposed to doing it through animals just for more profit. We don’t have to destroy any new land at all, just use what we currently have more efficiently. If we’re using our agriculture towards animals and not humans just so we can eat the animals then this is the least sustainable way for food production. Is it understandable now? I don’t understand why you can’t see the logic.	UCsDVIq43B_9-4zUEOYW2HEg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsDVIq43B_9-4zUEOYW2HEg	1	Ugx7J_vvwEmBhcifTsR4AaABAg	Chris Andersen

It takes up more land and contributes to more deforestation and soil erosion than any animal farm. If everyone went vegan, we'd have LESS land because we'd have to cut down more and more rainforests in order to use MORE and MORE land to grow more and more plants. Agriculture destroys the environment more than ranching. The most environmentally friendly way to eat - hunting wild animals, or foraging for wild plants/mushrooms. That way you don't use a bunch of land to grow monocultures. what you're suggesting is that we cover more and more land with industrial agriculture planting unsustainable fields of monocultures that destroy the ecosystem.

Your assumption is that if people went vegan they would solely rely on soy as a substitute for meat but this is far from the truth. In fact almost half of vegans (41%) don’t consume soy as we are cations of the way it impacts the environment. You are also disregarding the fact that livestock requires much more food and water than soybeans and it just ends up being wasted as the animals that have consumed so much of the resources that could feed humans are slaughtered. To argue that more land use = more harmful for environment is utterly foolish, you have to account for resources. Also if your disregarding co2 and it’s impact on the climate than you have lost all credibility in your argument. If your going to disregard scientific evidence then you pretty much have the same argument as people who argue for flat earth in which case debating is pointless because you don’t back your claims with fact. If your misinterpretation of veganism and continued consumption of products that are harmful for the planet helps you sleep at night, so be it.

Consuming meat and animal products requires animal abuse. That's just an indisputable fact that we can't avoid. You wouldn't think it was ok for your pet to be abused Monday through Friday, so why other animals? It's all or nothing because veganism is a belief system that rejects the exploitation of animals. You don't believe in something like that while being complacent of "only" torturing animals 5 out of 7 days. Think about it.

Every step is important and we have to be clear what the best lifestyle for us as a human race should be. The best diet for health and environment is plant based, regional, seasonal, zero waste etc. I think it is important to see this as a goal. We can't be perfect. Everyone fails. But we have to focus on this to create a positive future for our spaceship earth. Vegetarian is a good step. Before I turned vegan I was a vegetarian for three years. Now I am a happy vegan and would never go back to cheese, milk and eegs. Stuff that isn't good for anything nowadays.

The world will have to adapt to many new ways of life or end up dying, there is no choice in the end. Dip your feet in the water of veganism/vegetarianism as slowly as you want but eventually you're gonna have to get in, the scale of meat the modern world is eating is far much more than is sustainable, and once more countries transition into an Americanized culture of eating "extravagant" meals with meat on every plate, a shortage will follow soon behind it. And that's assuming the world develops a more ethical means for raising livestock than the torturous life of factory farming like perhaps real free range farms. But the "more ethical choice" also uses more land. I could go on about the unethical life of dairy animals and how artificial insemination would not be tolerated for most other species but I see that your vegetarian so you must already be aware and just not care, that's not my business though	UCRASPK4nZIBagBNISOajkZA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRASPK4nZIBagBNISOajkZA	1	Ugw6tkUBMTFlL5x8ttJ4AaABAg	Luke Schwartz

Entertain me for a second and truly think about that. An animal had to be bred into existence and kept alive for months/years, only to have its life ended to give you a few minutes of pleasure. It's your choice to listen to music, buy a cell phone, watch Netflix, drink a coffee - but none of those things have a violent impact on another being. What I'm saying is when meat eaters get annoyed by vegetarians or vegans and say "respect my decision!!!" it's not really possible to respect that, because we don't feel it's your decision to _make_ when it involves killing something else. Would you be OK with me murdering someone's pet, if you didn't know that person? I mean, after all, it's just _my_ choice, right?

Nothing vegans eat existed in nature in its current state prior to 100 years ago. Man made fake anti nutrient sugar diet killing the oceans and the rivers. Being flown and shipped across the seas. You are all so easily fooled. All my food comes within a 100km radius of my house in minimal packaging. And no B12 injections. Yay! I also live close to potato farms. Dead land with no nutrients planted over and over and over. Sprayed constantly with toxins. So "sustainable". Animals are life. We are OF the ECO system.

Methane is not dissolved like CO2 into the ocean and it floats higher up than CO2, so it has more of a greenhouse effect. Not to say that if we all were to drive all electric cars and all get solar panels on our roofs that this would not help. Yes, it would. Loads of people are NOT interested in changing any of their habits. So the few who will have to bend backwards to offset those who are worshipping the god in the mirror. They are also hurting themselves. But people who are stubborn will not admit they have a problem. They are so sure that only what they eat tastes good and won't give anything a try. Like me, until I got crippling arthritis, you couldn't tell me. I had to tell myself. I did the research on my own. I convinced myself both about my own health and how to solve my issues and that animals don't deserve to be on the daily menu 3x's a day.

Now you see the cost of what you used to like to do. At this point you receive the just desserts of what you or I or everyone else has earned. Now we see the fires around the world and the fish and animals disappearing and gee, we have no idea how that happened? It was PEOPLE. Yes, maybe not us in particular but despite, it is what humankind has done and those who have tried to warn others are handed the task of trying to wake up those who don't want to be woken up, those who have never had a care in the world and think the world owes them tomorrow or those who have had a life of cleaning up after others. In which case, doesn't seem much different, what a preparation for what you haven't a clue about. And why is that you don't have a clue? Jesus is coming back and most of the worst parts of the book of Revelation are in the works or have happened. So if you have things you need to do or get right, then do them because you have no idea how much time there is left. The term "patience" has both and individual meaning as we individually don't know how long we have. But in terms of all humanity, His patience is at an end or if not very shortly. He gave us a beautiful world and we killed just about everything or genetically altered it. If you were Him, would you not be sick of humanity?

Do you suppose those who are damned care about anything? It is those who we can reach, that is why we try. But when you listen to what God has done with Bill Schnobelen and David Wood, so long as any draw breath and long for an answer in which there is love and kindness still in this world, so only God knows.

My personal favourite is when a self righteous vegan says anything of the sort, you get the meat eater response "I'm gonna go eat a giant steak just to spite you stupids vegans" comment. Yes I'am a vegan, and do sometimes get up on my high horse about peoples eating habits, not because they eat meat or whatever, but because they are the type of people who have a million health issues and have a horrendous diet.

Every video I watch related to the environmental impact of meat or those fake burgers has these people who really try to defend it by saying “it’s healthy” or “it’s natural”. They are just wilfully ignoring what they don’t want to hear. I for one am really excited for lab grown meat or those fake vegan burgers. They will eventually be exactly like real meat but with much less environmental impact, and probably be cheaper too. Maybe not now, but soon.

You’re just as harmful to the conversation we all NEED to have about the environment/climate as people who refuse to do anything to help. So don’t feel entitled or feel that just because you are vegan you are above people because you’re not. Education without attacking is the key. Don’t shame but work with people. That’s your flaw and that’s the flaw of other combative vegans. I’m flexible personally, I limit my meat intake to 2x a week and if I want to eliminate it that’s my choice. Just as the video explained we all just need to cut down on our meat consumption, others can stop all together if they want, to help our planet.

Dave3	Savon Abnormal absolutely, we are the ONLY species of animal that carries on using Lactose after going onto solid food, we are also the ONLY species that drinks Lactose from a different animal. Cow Lactose is designed for fast groowing big boned animals. Cos of this it is extremely unhealthy for humans, on top of that factory farmed Dairy herds have a massive problem with Mastitis cos of the animals being forced to produce much more Lactose than they can naturally manage. Also the milking machines are used on thousands of animals, these two aspects( and others) of factory farming means even with regular/routine Anti Biotic shots farmers can’t get rid of Mastitis which has resulted in governments allowing a % of Mastitis Puss to be in Dairy products, approx 1 eye dropper full in each glass of Cow Lactose( aka Milk). On top of the Puss in your ‘Milk’ etc there will also be large amounts of Anti Biotics making super bugs and creating a tolerance to Anti Biotics so they no longer work as they should if you feel you ever need them!.

I know if I eat a lot of cheese I get really bad ance. I'm hoping that lab meat will go well in the future because honestly, I like beef. Also, down there in the thread, we are omnivores by nature, but all diets (vegan/vegetarian/or omnivore) are healthy and normal provided that you actually get all your normal nutrients. It doesn't matter how you get them as long as you get them. Never mind only eating specific foods, some people can't afford certain diets. Nice that you perfer your diet and you're proud of it, I don't need it shoved in my face.

In fact if you look at early human evolution eating meat is arguably one of the factors that led to the development of modern human traits - like larger brain size, tool use, skeletal structure, cooperation, etc. etc. Also not all human populations suffer medical problems from diets high in meat and animal protein. Inuit tribes eat much more meat than the average American but don't suffer the same health consequences. I think you make a lot of valid points, but most of the problems with an omnivorous diet and benefits of a vegan diet have arisen in the last hundred years or so, after the agricultural industry really industrialized and changed our food sheds so radically, and within an evolutionarily short period of time.

Cows can eat chickens in pellet form and survive. It doesn’t mean they’re healthy doing so. They have health problems as a result just like humans do. Look at all the health problems people have who eat large amounts of animal products. People have accepted heat attacks, stroke, various cancers, and diabetes as hereditary or a natural stage of life. Most Americans or other first world countries aren’t getting enough macronutrients and have to take a bunch of supplements. Plants only come with benefits. I can’t even keep track of all the vitamins and minerals found in each one because there are so many. I don’t have to worry about any cholesterol, animal protein, mammalian estrogen, insulin like growth factor, or large amounts of saturated fat with no fiber. Being vegan is the most fulfilling and easy thing I could have done especially after learning all essential amino acids are found in all plants. Technically I could eat only oranges and get enough protein as long as I eat enough calories. I don’t recommend only eating one food but in terms of protein (since people only seem to care about that) you could get the perfect amount that way. At first it seems a little scary but you get used to it. I love cooking. I’m more creative nowhere than ever and I appreciate the taste of food more now that I don’t add a much of salt or oil if any	UChxcpQZQ123BoL6bKWQaWDg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UChxcpQZQ123BoL6bKWQaWDg	1	Ugz0VKInJgJnadupFoh4AaABAg	Savon Abnormal

Please watch DOMINION. Causing this much suffering just for your habit is wrong even if you do it once a week I was reducing so much i was down to once a month practically then i just stopped eating meat altogether. Basically every piece of meat you eat is the result of the most heinous torture and suffering and ALL of this isn't just unnecessary for our well being but actually harmful - so why continue supporting the cruelty?

We would probably be a bunch of australopithecus if our ancestors never touched meat. We later became omnivores and it is our nature now for it is how our ancestors got the most nutrients....and it is the most beneficial diet. Many studies have also pointed out that our bodies indicate that we are designed to eat meat and plants. Read this if you won't believe me. https://paleoleap.com/human-brains-evolved-meat/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5417583/ http://time.com/4252373/meat-eating-veganism-evolution/ https://www.google.com.ph/amp/s/www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/amp/320047 Side note: If you want to be vegan fine. But please don't insist vegan is actually "natural" for humans. Please mind that you have access to plant based alternatives and dietary supplements because of the modern era. I can understand why others vouch to going vegan, but going against our nature isn't the way to go and please understand if some just want to eat meat. In fact going on mediterranean diet could reduce your carbon footprint greatly as mentioned by OP.

Rather, they're dietary patterns. There are human populations that are completely carnivorous (though this is fringe and not many people can do it) while there are also very large vegetarian populations and, of course, vegans. The vast majority of the human population is capable of going vegan.	UCcOndqQ3Ks1DyOCtZAgdU3w	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcOndqQ3Ks1DyOCtZAgdU3w	1	UgztDBwuVhVLTp3JShl4AaABAg	m_ari_e02

Surface temperatures will remain approximately constant at elevated levels for many centuries after a complete cessation of net anthropogenic CO2 emissions. A large fraction of anthropogenic climate change resulting from CO2 emissions is irreversible on a multi-century to millennial timescale, except in the case of a large net removal of CO2 from the atmosphere over a sustained period.

Most ruminants, like the animals we eat, get the b12 in the grass as it is produced in the soil, not through injections or in their feed. Anyways, that's not my point, I was trying to say how vegan is unnatural due to the fact that we have to take supplements for it, how is that supposed to be 'healthier' for humans. A lot of research suggests that the reason as to why we developed so much more in comparison to apes etc is because we started eating cooked meat (thus our teeth are the way they are- as we do not need them for ripping out meat etc).

The most healthy and sustainable diet would be one where you eat locally sourced foods as well as ones that you grow yourself. If you think about it, the supplements don't just grow on trees, likewise to many other vegan products. Many fake meats and supplementary foods are just as bad for the planet with all the processes. It would be better if people stopped to think for a bit instead of being drip fed all their information.

If you value anecdotal evidence more, my sister dated a long-time vegan and adopted his diet. They were eating the same meals, but by the third month she was feeling the sickest and weakest she's ever felt. She didn't regain her energy until she ate a bbq rib rack, and he instead ran to the parking lot to puke, he couldn't even handle the odour of meat. TL;DR A one-size-fits-all diet DOESN'T exist, people of different genetic makeup have the same nutritional needs but different dietary tolerances.

Also, you admitted that your "research" was done a long time ago. In science my dear, time is crucial because we come up with new theories every day. Anyway, are you saying that having a cow or 2 in captivity is bad for the environment? What's the difference if there is a cow living on a piece of land that is surrounded by a little fence and a cow that lives on a piece of land in the wild? Or are you basically saying that we should cause deliberate cow extinction because their farts and land occupation are bad for the climate?

It doesn't matter whether people have good intention. Meat causing cancer has been debunked. Too much of anything is bad. At least most of time. There is a man who rather lost weight with meat centered diet. He claimed that problem with modern meat is livestock feed and factory farming. The problem is antibiotic and feeding corn. Also those studies showing link between meat and cancer are not showing full pictures. They generally have poor examples. How many of those people ate healthy whole food? It turns out that those Americans use processed junk food. That's the problem. Vegan can suffer from the same processed food, too. I respect vegan intention and goal. I agree that meat consumption, especially in developed countries like US needs to be reduced. Fortunately, people already started taking less meat last few years, but this year, meat consumption is expected to rise. I agree that there are many problems with modern animal agriculture, especially factory farming, but just painting every animal agriculture with the same bad practice is hasty generalization. Also, calling for the entire world to go vegan is naive and impractical. Actually, it's inefficient because not everyone thrives on vegan diet, not to mention many parts of the world can't support farming. (Science may be work around that. We will see.) People with longest life span rely on non vegan style. Actually, supporting edible bug is better. You know why? Bugs can thrive on tons of food waste and effectively convert them to nutrition. Fruits and vegetables result in tons of food waste even before going to shelf. So why not use bugs like black soldier flies to get rid of them and convert them to protein? Or simply feed those maggots to chickens. It is proven that insect feed is very efficient for raising livestock. They take way less space, too. Even better than plant protein if you want to talk about efficiency. There are many ways to tackle environmental problems. It's not always black and white.

Or do you think it was good idea to almost wipe out buffalo? Of course not. It's just that developed countries, especially, US eats too much meat. It's all about balance. Yes. Vegan is much better than current American diet, but it's not the most efficient or sustainable option. In fact, it's ranked fourth. https://qz.com/749443/being-vegan-isnt-as-environmentally-friendly-as-you-think/ If you are vegan who also eats imported good, then you are an environmental hypocrite. People who buys local meat(Not factory farm. Mostly local) with less transportation have smaller footprint than vegans who eat imported vegetables and crops from other side of the world. Should I blame vegans for demanding quiona? Which caused quiona price to skyrocket in its native land? In return, it became more expensive than chicken. Can you blame people choosing chicken over quiona for economic reason? All I am saying is that it's not just black and white. It's complicated issue.

I looked for that information a long time ago, and never found any data that really backed it up. As for small family farms, do they truly have less of an environmental footprint then large industrial farming? They use more land per animal, and the animal lives longer, which means, more feed, water, and greenhouse gases emitted.

We need Animal products. In small amounts, but we do. The numbers they show in this video are purely mass production numbers. News FLASH - mass produced anything is bad for the planet. The only way to be good to both the planet and yourself, is to have locally sourced Animal products, from small family farms that don't use antibiotics and keep their lifestock in natural conditions. But we're in the real world unfortunately. Going back to the vegan thing - if vegans are correct and eating meat is unnatural, what are eskimos supposed to eat then?

But people who stick to this ideology, always arguing about how they are &quot;better&quot; and more moral than what they call the &quot;meat eaters&quot;, have the same personality characteristics of people who are susceptible to adhere to a sect.

But is it really true that the 1 billion tons of animal feed is directly translatable to human consumable food? I hear this point brought up all the time, but never see this claim substantiated. I&#39;ve heard of peanut hulls and egg shells being used in animal feed, which are clearly not suitable for human consumption. And what about hay?<br /><br />The only paper I could find concerning this matter was &quot;Animal Feed vs. Human Food: Challenges and Opportunities in Sustaining Animal Agriculture Toward 2050&quot;, published by The Council for Agricultural Science and Technology in 2013. It calls this feed-to-food claim into question, especially when it comes to how animal livestock are utilized in less-developed countries, which have the highest rate of population growth, greatly benefit from livestock as sources of fertilizer and high-quality protein, and also lack the infrastructure to store and transport cereal crops.<br /><br />Have ya&#39;lls read this, or know of other materials which speak to this point? Unsurprisingly, a lot of the meat lobby types have taken this paper up, but the paper itself seems pretty impartial and well-researched.

The argument is much more convincing. Also, my favourite part of cooking is experimenting with plant-based substitutes for traditional meat- dishes.

If there&#39;s some reason you can&#39;t eat a lot of soy, that rules out pretty much every other meat substitute. Lentils, beans, and nuts are very filling for not a lot of protein, and the texture leaves something to be desired. Yellow pea protein tastes like powdered vomit. I&#39;d love to be vegan; I actually find meat kind of unappetizing, but there&#39;s not nearly as many options as there should be. The fake-meat industry is still in its infancy.

Overnight expecting negative results to prove a point to my best friend who went vegan before me, I was wrong. Try 2 weeks, you can't tell me you that you can't do that little of time. That's one pay period lmao. 14 days, no meat, no dairy, no eggs, read every ingredient on everything and turn it away if it's questionable, easy veganism. I promise if you do 2 weeks you will at least have an appreciation for how your body COULD potentially feel if you switched your diet around. I think it's important to cut out meat entirely, but ethically sourced dairy and egg products are definitely ok in my book, I just happen to think their gross and get sick when eating them.

How do anthropogenic Carbon Dioxide emissions explain the end of the last Ice Age (roughly 11,700 years ago)?<br /><br />Assuming your answer is &quot;they don&#39;t,&quot; i.e., accurate:<br />2. How do &quot;Climate Change models&quot; mathematically control for whatever forces DID cause Ice Age(s) to come and go repeatedly between 1 million and 20,000 years Before the Present?<br /><br />Assuming your answer is &quot;they don&#39;t,&quot; i.e., accurate:<br />3. Why do you assume the forces which have caused dramatic climate fluctuations in Earth&#39;s climate during the past million years can simply be omitted from models which intend to account for human influences on contemporary climate?<br /><br />4. What about other factors besides human forces?<br /><br />I have yet to encounter a single individual who espouses &quot;climate change alarm&quot; notions who has been able to succinctly, sincerely, and completely answer these questions.

In addition to limiting red meat in our diets, a cow’s diet itself is significant in the production of methane as certain species of plants that have had small portions incorporated into cows’ diets have decreased methane emissions by as much as 99%.

Could you please also talk about how changing our diet to a more &quot;Mediterranean&quot; diet would affect other aspects of humanity on a global scale?<br /><br />This video ignores taking into account: price (calories / dollar), global economic impact (i.e. stealing all the quinoa from every native quinoa-eating country), and local availability. Sure, it&#39;s nice to say &quot;wow it&#39;d be optimal if everyone ate lentils and rice for every meal&quot;. When the rice and lentils are being shipped fully around the globe to be processed and then delivered to our local grocery, the carbon emissions start to look a lot different than just eating your local farmer&#39;s beef, if that&#39;s available. And fish? seriously? Used to like Vox, but this is the kind of half-assed sensionalist &quot;wow look at this new science&quot; that makes me want to vomit up all the delicious steak I just consumed.

The problem isn’t meat but capitalism that mass produces meat by artificially rising livestock to create cheap meat for the consumers. If people had access to own livestock for themselves instead of profit the issue will be solved. You can’t force someone to change their diet, especially if it is ingrained into their culture. I mean look at India nearly 40% of the population are vegetarians (the highest in the world in terms of numbers) yet India produces one of the highest level of pollution. This vegan propaganda is bullshit as usual. Next they will put lions on trials for daring to eat meat.	UCVGuaOA8NZoAWaEKiZQNbsg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVGuaOA8NZoAWaEKiZQNbsg	0

Part of it also depends on how the fish is caught. You can find lots of online resources, like this: http://seafood.edf.org/guide/best. Where I live, farmed arctic char, clams, mussels, and oysters, Rainbow Trout that are U.S. farmed are just a few good fish to eat. The three things you have to think about are how the fish is caught, what type of fish, and where it is from. A great website to use is seafoodwatch.org! I hope this helps you pick out the best fish!

As long as people eat carefully with fish, it's okay. I think going vegan is the best for the enviroment, but I'm not vegan myself. I've been cutting out meat from my diet, and have been trying to convince my family the same. Essentially, as long as you purchase fish from good companies and the right species of fish, there is a much smaller impact than just buying whatever kind of fish.

No one wants to give up meat, it&#39;s delicious I agree. However, when correctly taking into account the suffering that our diet choices will impose on people around the world (especially those least for climate change in the global south) should be enough motivation to eat least do a meatless Monday or Mediterranean switch. Great video, we mustn&#39;t shame people or ask for radical change. We can all do something in our personal lives to mitigate CC and achieve better health outcomes!

My doctor put me on b12 supplements but my body couldn’t digest them properly, so I had to put meat back into my diet (b12 isn’t naturally found in plant-based protein). But I couldn’t stand the thought of eating most types of meat, so I settled on having seafood occasionally.	UCnMrH73dTJZwMuJlYyOd_KQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnMrH73dTJZwMuJlYyOd_KQ	0

Yes, lets put carnivores on a vegan diet. I'm sure the tigers will be so happy with their quinoa salad. Same as putting your dogs or cats on a vegan diet, trying to project your personal beliefs on a being that is formed by millions of years of evolution to eat meat is plain irresponsible.

But still, they should talk a bit more about the different ways life stocks are raised. Not every country has such heavily industrialised life stock raising like in the US. This makes the research sounds rather blunt. The word &quot;you&quot; and &quot;we&quot; in these VDOs sometimes don&#39;t seem to apply to all of us in other parts of the world.

Of course some fish are worse than others, same as it's environmentally worse to eat green beans flown from Kenya than a rabbit you caught in your backyard. I think most countries now heavily regulate to what extent most deep sea fish can be trawled for and a lot of the more common freshwater fish we consume such as trout and salmon are now farmed with very little impact on the environment.

You don't have to entirely eat meat, but it isn't good for anyone to just eat meat willy-nilly. Keep that in mind, and you can still eat meat responsibly.

I&#39;m almost a vegan myself because it felt right for me but I&#39;m not the kind of person demanding that grade of consistency from anyone. In fact it&#39;s a lot more constructive to tell the people that they actually <i>can</i> eat meat (by that they won&#39;t switch off their brains immediately, becoming all offended and defensive) but rather to tell them that already subtle reductions in the amount of meat we eat and in diet in general can make reasonable differences.

All vegans are plant based; not all plant based people are vegan. Veganism is a philosophy that rejects the commodification of animals and the notion that they are resources, instead of individual beings with emotions, personalities, and needs. Both the Mediterranean diet and lacto-ovo-vegetarianism allow for the exploitation of animals and therefore don&#39;t fall under the vegan umbrella.<br /><br />As for the environmental aspect of veganism, I recommend anyone interested watch Cowspiracy, available on Netflix. It goes into a lot of detail about what animal agriculture does to our planet.	UCBWhfkyS9d3tCBmmNJRsPoQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBWhfkyS9d3tCBmmNJRsPoQ	0

(less humans too lol, as there would be less cars and less production altogether) On a more serious note, it's not just the cow farts. It's the water needed to grow and process the food for the cows. The higher up you go the food chain, less energy is retained. As they said in the video, if we just ate the grains that the cows ate, we would save a lot of trouble.

Wallabies are a grass feeding animal that produce significantly less methane than cows do for their size and it in part because a certain bacteria in their gut. Considering how most of our livestock is injected with hormones and such anyway, it might worth the data to test a method of getting these bacteria in cows.

Animal agriculture uses 1/3 of the world's water, 1/3 of the world's fuel, cause desertification of the land, soil depletion, and dump massive amounts of fecal waste into our waterways (leading to hypoxic dead zones). Let's not forget the deforestation, displacement of indigenous ppl, 3rd world starvation due to corporate land grabs & manipulation of food trade prices, wildlife extinction bc the cattle industry lobbies for hunting mandates that kill off land competitors, sealife extinction bc of the excessively exploited fishing & due to the fact that cattle are fed fish pellets. There's also the matter of our taxes paying all the subsidies for meat. If we cut out meat, it would create an economic boom for us bc we'd reduce the amount of taxes & allocate them towards infrastructure or allow us to generate consumer spending towards other industries.

Those areas are too dry for the fungus etc that break down organic matter in rainforests, so ruminant animals doing it is the only option in nature. 37% of the planet's surface is currently in use for agriculture, but only 10% of that is capable of supporting any level of crop production, the rest can only support animals & is the type of land I just described, so I really don't think removing the animals would help, it would just lead to more grass fires. If we could return natural grazing animals to the land, that might be different, but I can't see that happening & it wouldn't change the methane output anyway. Shutting down factory farming is a different story! Taking animals out of those feedlots, no longer growing crops to feed animals, just putting them in the right place - on those semi-arid areas & feeding them just on the grass that grows there would definitely reduce methane levels, especially since dung beetles bury the dung & then soil bacteria break down the methane into harmless elements in those settings	UCZsUD6fbggZVj-l6XcBrPdw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZsUD6fbggZVj-l6XcBrPdw	1	Ugy22QQ4BANkYBCiLCl4AaABAg	lefthandovRA

Fertilisers are generally government subsidised & cost next to nothing, so farmers use the "more-on" approach anytime something isn't growing properly & smother it with moron chemicals. There is also legislation in all developed world counties (where the vast majority of CAFO's are located that prohibit improper management of waste as a health hazard. It's pure bullshit to claim nitrogen runoff in the ocean is coming from animals not nitrogen applied as fertiliser! palm oil is used in a range of products, but most meat eaters know that animal based products blend best with human skin. It's vegans who want animal free alternatives & palm oil provides that. Vegans are also creating so much lobbying that even though their numbers are small, a disproportionate number of products are changing ingredients in order to be able to label themselves as "vegan", which is why there is so much demand for palm oil! Vegan are FAR more responsible for deforestation than meat eaters are! & as for rubber, maybe you can explain to me what your using to replace leather & sheepskin in your shoes & slippers if not rubber from those plantations? & lastly, if we look at irresponsible farming practices, we see crops are the worst in a huge range of ways, if we look at average farming of both, we see MASSIVE run off & wind errosion in crops, particularly in climate change situations, while we so NO runoff with livestock. If we look at best possible practice on both, we see that there is no way to avoid run off & erosion in a large variety of settings, other than perennial grasses - which are therefore only suitable for livestock farming & significantly reduce available agricultural land on the planet if not used as such (from 37% of the earth's surface to 10% of the earth's surface) & therefore we very rarely see best practice in crop farming in the world today! On the other hand, when we look at best practice livestock management, we see massive land regeneration & reversal of desertification & massive increases in soil carbon, leading to increased water retention, reduced run off & massive soild biliding - in fact the ONLY way to restore the 1/3rd of the world's croplands that have been destroyed by chemical fertilisers is by converting that land to pasture & using years of animals on the land to restore it (although again, when we switch to best practice, some farmers are acheiving restoration of land with NOTHING that will grow to full productive pasture within 12 months - still 5-10 years to flush the chemical fertiliser salts out & build up enough carbon to grow crops again without needing extensive chemical fertilsier, herbicides & pesticides though There are more organisms in a single handful of healthy soil than there are humans who have ever lived on this planet! Chemical fertilsier kills them all! There can be near to zero in that 1/3rd of land I'm talking about as destroyed. Livestock in high enough concentrations can poop out enough organisms to repopulate & restore teh soil eco-system, so it can begin carbon sequencing again, but until those livestock are added, it will do nothing but loose soil & add to global warming as all that carbon leaves the ground & enters the air. Eco-systems do NOT survive with chemicals replacing animals, like vegans want to see!

Again, it is undeniable that the environmental damage caused by the palm tree industry in Indonesia is staggering, but that's a completely different topic.

The Loss (sorry, can't spell) plateau in China is the classic example of that & the vegans go to example of how it's possible to plant trees in "deserts". It's actually fertilie land, that they grazed & grew crops on in ridiculous ways & turned it to desert. Crops are the worst for desertifying, because they plow the land & then leave it bare waiting for rain, which leads to massive erosion & so then the rain can't get properly absorbed. The solution is to plant anything that will grow into that land to hold it together (normally perennial native grasses), however grass is a high nitrogen user, so if you don't get some fertilsier in there, then it will die off & again you get desertification. The best solution, therefore is to get the native grasses in, then once they're mature & have seed, send a big mob of animals in for a single day to prune them down to the ground & thoroughly fertilise, then move the animals off to a new area, carrying the seed with them & send the animals back once it's mature again. That's refered to as "holistic grazing" & is having HUGE success in reversing desertified areas of fertile & semi-arid land. Video showing the results https://youtu.be/vpTHi7O66pI?t=984 & there's natually methane eating bacteria in the soil & in that system they thrive too & so there's no need to geneticly modify the cows to stop them producing it (in fact there's no evidence ruminents have EVER had ANY influence on methane levels in the atmosphere http://www.amazingcarbon.com/PDF/JONES-CarbonFriendlyBeef(27April10).pdf )	UCZsUD6fbggZVj-l6XcBrPdw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZsUD6fbggZVj-l6XcBrPdw	1	Ugy22QQ4BANkYBCiLCl4AaABAg	lefthandovRA

For every calorie of food, it takes only 2 calories of fuel to produce Soy, 3 to produce Corn, 3 to produce Wheat, and 54 to produce Meat. That's a 2600% increase just for meat! So yes when I said that it is inefficient converting calories of grain to produce meat, this is partly why. Chickens & pigs convert grain into meat at rates of 2 to 1, or 3 to 1 (ie, it takes 2kg of feed to produce 1kg of chicken). The ratio for lamb is between 4:1 and over 6:1 & that for beef starts at 5:1 and goes as high as 20:1. Meat is an inefficient source of calories, case closed. It accounts for 17% of global calorific intake, but uses twice that amount of land, water and feed. And here's the other part why: Not all of the cow makes it to the table. On avg, a 1,000 lb steer will only weigh 61% of its live weight once it makes it to the rail. This approximate 39% loss during the slaughter & dressing procedure is a result of the animal being bled & the hide, head, hooves, viscera, lung & heart being removed. The remaining 61% is referred to as "Hanging Weight" or the weight "On the Rail". But the loss doesn't stop there. Once the carcass is on the rail, it begins to leach moisture (shrink) which accounts for additional weight loss. This along with fat and bone removed during the cutting account for an 18% loss. In summary, a steer averaging 1,000 lbs on the hoof will avg around 430 lbs of retail cuts ( steaks, roasts, ground beef, stew beef, etc.) Again, very wasteful and inefficient. I think I'll stick to my beans, veggies, and potatoes.	UCNV-z5HXmj4ZRtiDXmPsLyA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNV-z5HXmj4ZRtiDXmPsLyA	1	Ugy22QQ4BANkYBCiLCl4AaABAg	lefthandovRA

And desertification doesn't just come from lack of rain fall. Researchers name 2 forms of desertification, one by climate and the other by man-made forces. The one I'm talking about is the 2nd type. In ranges where rainfall remained consistent, large patches & areas of desertification appeared sporadically near areas that had stable grasses. What they found was that desertification appeared most around domesticated overgrazing. This can be observed the most in the Middle East where overgrazing existed for far more centuries. And we're following the same pattern in both North & South America. Cattle are not a native animal, they were imported & domesticated here. Like any new species introduced into an ecosystem, it drove out competitors like Buffalo & Bison which are now an endangered species. The difference between water irrigation for rice and drought for rice and meat is huge. For almonds, the researchers at the University of California show almonds to require 23 gallons for an ounce of almonds compared to 106 gallons for an ounce of beef. Not to mention that lb for lb, nobody eats rice and almonds as much as they eat meat. That's hardly a fair comparison, especially considering that 1 lb of meat requires 2500 to 5,000 gallons of water (depending on your sources). "Some" of what I listed was transportation? Are you kidding, I listed transportation once. The rest were based on machinery, factory, production, and packaging. And even if avocados were to be transported, they're not on the same level of demand as animals. Bc we're not just transporting animals, but also the soy & grain we fly & boat in from the 3rd world lands to feed livestock. And yes, that grain you mentioned as a cause of deforestation, that grain is fed to livestock. And I never said that deforested lands were part of the food market trade. I said corporate land grabs of 3rd world countries were. Those corporate farms interfere with the land ownership & market competition of local farmers in 3rd world countries. Many of them go bankrupt, many workers are traded in exchange for machinery & go into poverty. Back to the drought dilemma, California alone sends 100 billion gallons of water in alfalfa to Asian countries where we import livestock. That's alot of water & fuel used to export out & export back in. Hardly an efficient way to produce food. Continued below....

Save the planet with your choices, not out of greed but compassion for life beyond ourselves. Go vegan.	UCwyhSzusiircb3ErOsN5AoQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwyhSzusiircb3ErOsN5AoQ	0

Even though cutting down our meat consumption is an important (though already well known) contributor to reducing carbon emissions, this video does not at all go into the contribution of the global market to the problem. Now that most food items can be imported from all over the world, people forget to buy locally and seasonally. That would could so many emissions due to transportation and stocking.

The more plants you eat the less there are to suck up that carbon dioxide hence you still pollute the earth. My argument is just as ridiculous as this one is. Give me hard facts and numbers which are not biased then I&#39;ll believe you.<br /><br />&quot;A single mature tree can absorb carbon dioxide at a rate of 48 lbs./year and release enough oxygen back into the atmosphere to support 2 human beings.&quot;​<br />- McAliney, Mike.

The EPA has the US Agriculture accounting for 9% of US greenhouse gases and 27% from transportation. This is simply because basically everyone in the US drives and eats, while about 1 in 6 people drive globally, but everyone eats. If you go from &quot;average American&quot; to vegan American, you might see about an 7-8% drop in the greenhouse gas emotions, not nothing, but also not massive. If you change from an average American car to an very fuel efficient car, you half your part of the 27% from transportation which is 63% of that, so you reduce your greenhouse gases by 8.5%. If you go to electric car, you drop about 14%. Though the issue with cars is that the amount of greenhouse gas to make a car, it is close to driving a car 40,000 miles to get the same CO2 it is to make an average car.

Ugxl4w5qNbwtn7kpk7h4AaABAg	2	1	2017-12-12 22:44:51	Jason Peng	to everybody saying that veganism is better, we get it. veganism does save resources such as water and reduce CO2 emissions.<br /><br />However, veganism also takes away land from ecosystems, like forests and woods in which animals like goats are bred in. It consumes much more land because much more crops are consumed per day than meat (you probably eat around 200% more grain than chicken a day).<br /><br />Not only that, but many vegans consume market oil, which is developed from animal fat; animal fats are also used industrially very commonly. To take away these animal fats would require new replacements to be developed, which is costly and isnt always doable.<br /><br />Veganism has its arguments, and it has its counterarguments. If somebody doesn&#39;t want to be vegan or does, it&#39;s their choice, and you have no right to enforce what you don&#39;t even know is truly beneficial to the world on somebody else.

Because the goat and sheep farms I've been on i would not describe as woods at all. They are low biodiversity rocky grasslands which bleed into the surrounding native landscape. With the points about animal production byproducts, we will as a species just have to find an alternative or end the industry that uses it. As it appears that animal production is harmful to our species it is a required inevitability.

It takes about 1/16th the land to grow plants to feed humans directly than it does to feed livestock which are then fed to humans. Not to mention the inefficient use of resources. Why filter my grains through a corpse when I can eat my nutrients directly at a fraction of the cost? Also, meat is incredibly resource-intensive. It's more than just methane & carbon emissions. Animal agriculture uses 1/3 of the world's water, 1/3 of the world's fuel, cause desertification of the land, soil depletion, and dumps massive amounts of fecal waste into our waterways (leading to hypoxic dead zones). Let's not forget the deforestation, displacement of indigenous ppl, 3rd world starvation due to corporate land grabs & manipulation of food trade prices, wildlife extinction bc the cattle industry lobbies for hunting mandates that kill off land competitors, sealife extinction bc of the excessively exploited fishing & due to the fact that cattle are fed fish pellets. There's also the matter of our taxes paying all the subsidies for meat. If we cut out meat, it would create an economic boom for us bc we'd reduce the amount of taxes & allocate them towards infrastructure or allow us to generate consumer spending towards other industries.

Why is carbon bad? Why do greenhouse gasses affect the climate? How do we know this effect is bad? How is me not eating meat going to change the climate? <br />Sorry, that&#39;s a lot, but I&#39;m confused. This makes zero sense to me.

There are many herbivores on this planet with teeth just like ours and bigger even... another example: gorillas/apes? there is only a few types of meats(birds, deer, cows, fish and pigs, most commonly anyways), there is millions of different plants you can eat. Also, i dont eat veggie burgers. That is also processed. "Good gods" way? im not religious and even the bible doesn't say your supposed to eat meat, dont just read the FIRST verse that says god gave us cows... read it all.. because it does state there was to be no death in this world.... read the bible again bro. lol and again... stop replying all unintelligent like... read something.

For people unwilling to give up consuming red meat, pork is a vastly better choice, comparable to turkey in climate effect, though not as good for your health. Beef and lamb are so far off the charts compared to all the other commonly eaten meats that switching to almost anything else will make a huge difference. It&#39;s the grass-grazing herd animals that cause problems way out of proportion to the meat they produce, due to their inefficient digestive systems and reproductive cycles. Pigs are different, as are obviously birds and fish.	UCb4W0VQ4ymKtQ9mcy9ALBbA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb4W0VQ4ymKtQ9mcy9ALBbA	0

We&#39;re currently cutting down forests to make room for grains so we can feed all those animals. This often happens in developing countries, where deforestation causes issues such as flooding and in some cases impacts ethnics groups. Eating meat (especially daily) doesn&#39;t only causes animals to suffer, it causes people in already vunerable positions to suffer. I personally see eating meat daily as an non ethical desicion for this reason. It doesn&#39;t seem fair to make people suffer so that I can eat something that I don&#39;t really need.

Tassy tiger is in the marsupial lion family, it was hunted to extinction by white man within 100 years, but it's biggest prey was a possum & even that is debated as to if it could take one alive or only scavenge. It never took human sized roos. Aboriginals numbered up to 1 million when whites arrived & they farmed animals like roos and crops, but in such harmony with the land that whites didn't even realise the crops weren't natural (and didn't want to, spoilt their propaganda that the land was uninhabited). Dingos do take a few, especially smaller wallabies, but they're not actually natives, they were introduced around 4,000 years ago. Impossible to say how the eco-system would function with them & not humans, since it's never happened, but mammals aren't natural here, only marsupials are, so it's likely not smart to try, especially since roos can live in the desert & dingos can't, so likely would end up a mess. Rewilding in Yellowstone etc is another story, since those predators were naturally there (and isn't that a success story! - which shouldn't really be surprising) & uneaten by human roo meat becomes pet food, but it's worth less, so shooters get paid less & are therefore of a lower skill level & make more mistakes. Assessments on human food culled roos show a really high levels of shooting accuracy & male only killing. Basically, the higher the value of the meat, the higher the animal welfare that goes with the kills. If the pet food market falls through, then the bodies are left to rot in paddocks & those ones are shot by amateur farmers, who often miss, often accidentally shoot mothers with young & while it's still better than some of the footage we get to see of their starving (maggots being laid under the skin of living animals & eating them alive once they're too weak to fend them off), the more we humans eat & the higher the meat value goes, the higher the shooter skill level & animal welfare checks (all shooters have tags that must be accounted for, human shooter tags are checked to ensure every kill was a clean, single shot to the brain) It still kinda yucks me out to be eating "skippy", but it is the most ethical meat eating option & does improve their welfare. I'd rather eat them than watch the news footage we saw back in 2002 again!!!!!!!!!!! _"This quote is not even including animal agriculture. The issue is greedy corporations and governments, as you say, not scarcity."_ that's the 40% of food we produce in the west & then dispose of, mostly because it wasn't up to "cosmetic standards" smh! INSANE! (plus the other stuff that report spoke of with using it for fuel etc) _"If people living in areas that can eat vegan do so"_ I'd prefer to see us use our influence to experiment with agriculture & learn more effective techniques that provide the highest possible level of animal welfare & then share these. There's no such thing as grain fed meat in Australia anymore, you have to special order it, due to a campaign to switch, for health & animal welfare reasons. That imo makes much more difference to overall animal welfare than a small percentage of people going vegan, since effectively all feedlots were shut down. The more people demanding grass fed, the more pressure on those systems & the more chance farmers will switch to the holistic farming model that was in your first FAO link, which then sees huge land improvements & productivity improvements & can easily be implemented in third world countries with few resourses. The other thing is that a HUGE amount of Australia's income comes from meat sales internationally. Remove that & we would have only mining left to make money. Is it really more ethical to be selling uranium & coal when compared to animals? Because with all of those removed, Australia becomes third world! I'd rather accept that income BUT not accept it in it's full & without question! We ship animals overseas, where they then enter feedlots & suffer incredibly cruel treatment! The industry says it's essential & the country can't afford to loose that income, well I don't accept that! I'll accept the meat industry, but NOT substandard treatment of animals, with an out of sight, out of mind attitude! I don't believe there's any necessity to put any animal on a ship alive! It's cruel & there's alternatives, we just need to push for them!!!!!!! gtg for now, will read those links later & reply some more I'm sure. I can't believe your getting them from vegan sites! My experience with vegan links is normally pure propaganda easily proven as completely wrong, but you've got some really great stuff that really looks at root causes & tries to find genuine solutions or at least recognises facts & truths about the world - I don't like our chances of ever beating the big money, but we can damwell try & give it everything we've got! :))	UCZsUD6fbggZVj-l6XcBrPdw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZsUD6fbggZVj-l6XcBrPdw	1	UgyMBq58PIQsKIeNziF4AaABAg	Daniella

And I think most kangaroo predators were actually hunted to extinction within the last 100 years or so by settlers, humans alone would not have been able to keep that large of a kangaroo population down haha. Same thing almost happened with deer and moose here in Minnesota, USA. Another problem caused by human shortsightedness. https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms11382#results this journal is associated with Scientific American (from the researchgate link) "Hunger is caused by poverty and inequality, not scarcity... According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations the world produces more than 1 1/2 times enough food to feed everyone on the planet. That’salready enough to feed 10 billion people, the world’s 2050 projected pop-ulation peak. But the people making less than $2 a day—most of whomare resource-poor farmers cultivating un-viably small plots of land—cannot afford to buy this food." This quote is not even including animal agriculture. The issue is greedy corporations and governments, as you say, not scarcity. My main concern is that a high-meat diet is also linked with affluence, and that the demand for meat products is rising. If people living in areas that can eat vegan do so, this could dampen the effects of animal agriculture in areas where veganism is not feasible with current agriultural and political trends. Veganism may not be accessible at the moment in parts of the world, BUT most of US/EU/AU definitely have the resources, thanks to globalization. It still is not the best answer ethically, environmentally, or for public health.

Where did you find them & do you have anymore to share? I think we're on the same page on this stuff :)) Lets add to those articles ending food waste too & not only going organic, but looking at crop natural suitability to regions & through varieties chosen (which the livestock link covered, but on crops too, eg painted mountain corn instead of regular or GM corn) Sorghum for example is far more drought tolerant than corn (that's what's used in Australia if crops are grown for animals), NASA's found 8 varieties of potatoes that they believe can grow on Mars - no GM, just looking at available natural varieties growing in harsh conditions on earth. We've got to get corperations & seeking out ways to make profit out of our food & return to connecting with nature & working with her instead of fighting her to produce our food! & we need to get some common sense back into food & farming choices!

I haven't read the others yet, but I would trust the FAO over the others, since they're the ones really in the front line figuring out how to feed the entire global populaiton & that link states _"Globally, there is enough cropland to feed 9 billion in 2050 if the 40 percent of all crops produced today for feeding animals were used directly for human consumption, while available grasslands were more efficiently used as the basis for livestock feed. Grassland-based and mixed crop-livestock systems optimize nutrient and energy cycles, while encouraging the use of rare livestock breeds that are adapted to lowinput and harsh environments. This is crucial in a context of climate change and increasing variability. "_ So they're saying that we still need meat to feed that number of people, but we need to put animals where they belong - on land too dry to grow crops! Just another comment on an extra point it made, about currently 33% of croplands used for animals, that's not always what it seems! I live in Australia, the UN states that 1% of the continent of Australia is suitable for growing continuous crops. Around 8-10% of the continent can be used up to once a year in good seasons, if given periods of rest/stock grazing in between crops. It's normal however for much of that land to fail to produce for up to a decade due to droughts, providing only low intensity livestock grazing (often including the livestock being fed the crops intended for human consumption that have failed due to drought). All that land would fall within that 33% they talk about as arable land, but it requires livestock on it in order to remain arable. In fact, 1/3rd of the planet's arable land has been lost in the last 40 years since chemical fertilisers were introduced, much of this could be salvaged with long term managed grazing to restore it, but more importantly, rotating grazing into land heading down this path, can rescue it before it's lost & maintain it's productivity long term. Extra point on this, 70% of Australia is used for farming of livestock - land that cannot be used for anything else, in fact people like the UN & other "experts" don't believe it's possible to get anywhere near 70% of the continent as agricultural land, saying 50% at most, due to more than that being termed as arid/desert land. The most sustainable agriculture in Australia is actually wild kangaroo harvesting (which is required for the health of the kangaroos & the land, since humans have been the only apex predator on the continent for 30,000 years & the entire eco-system would collapse if their roo culling was ended - was tested in 2002, after a few years of no culling due to animal welfare people successfully lobbying for it to end & 1/3rd of the roo population, 18million of them starved as a result, with countless other species also suffering & dying in mass numbers because of the roos eating everything as they died)	UCZsUD6fbggZVj-l6XcBrPdw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZsUD6fbggZVj-l6XcBrPdw	1	UgyMBq58PIQsKIeNziF4AaABAg	Daniella

Do your research with this in mind & you'll see I'm right. 10% of the planet's surface can be used to grow crops, 37% can be used to grow grass/raise animals/overall agricultural numbers & since the introduction of chemical fertiliser to replace animal manure 40 years ago, 1/3rd of the world's crop lands have been destroyed.

If you remove animals, the crop land that is already in use goes towards humans. Not much need for more cropland, just a different use of those crops. I do agree with you that palm oil deforestation in Indonesia is an issue, but companies like Hershey's and Coca Cola use far more palm oil in their products than a vegan diet does.

Of course it's not that simple, just because we can produce that much doesn't mean it can or even should go to those who need it, but it's just an indication of just how much it takes to raise livestock.

The meat that the cow produced is far less than the amount of food we gave it. While if we gave the food we give to the cow (or used the space it takes to grow the food) we could give it directly to the people as food, so we would have more food while using the same amount of space. :) (This is also why going vegetarian, vegan or even reducing your meat intake helps battle world hunger!)

You can&#39;t dig yourself out of the situation that you dug yourself into. You can&#39;t consume your way out of a problem you consumed your way into. Your individual choices don&#39;t matter. A systemic problem requires a systemic solution. Unless everyone stops eating meat your stopping eating meat won&#39;t matter.<br /><br />To forestall the inevitable comments, I&#39;ve been a vegan/vegetarian for twelve years. But that&#39;s because I don&#39;t want to ask of others what I&#39;m not willing to do myself.	UC9ieQTNSW_d46nrT0BAymVA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9ieQTNSW_d46nrT0BAymVA	0

"ok but how do you think a whole makes a change? It happens first by individuals. Change occurs by many chains of cause and effect. How do you think the voting system works? Your argument is basically invalidating democracy if you think that what one person thinks makes no difference." One vote doesn't make a difference. That's plainly obvious. Individuals don't matter in Democracy; coalitions are what matter in Democracies. That's why parties, caucuses within those parties, and special interest groups have such great power within our system. It's why community organizing is such a powerful tool. Atomized, consumerist notions of politics is what let Nader throw the election to Bush in 2000, and Berners throw the election to Trump in 2016. Because white Americans have been trained to view everything through the lens of consumerism and individualism instead of the collectivism and community action that actually brings the power in effect change. The sooner you and everyone who thinks like you learns this, the better we'll all be. "It's not possible for a whole group to think exactly the same, change happens first with individuals. The only way a "systematic change" can occur is if it has support, and the only way to garner support is if those ideas are already out there. Individual actions do make an impact, and videos like these are examples how those actions and ideas can be spread to make a greater difference." That's not how change happens. Ever. It has literally never happened that way in human history. Systematic change requires collective action to change systems. That's so obvious it's almost a tautology. It's why vegan-vegetarianism makes up >1% of the population. It's why collective organizations, like corporations and trade groups, have been able to effect regulator capture and subsidies while sustainable living has not. It's how the organic foods movement managed to be so easily appropriated and perverted by agribusiness. It's why cash crops like corn and soy beans, half of which get fed to animals for meat production, have huge subsidies while fruits and vegetables don't. Your not eating meat doesn't lead to a single less animal being raised. It doesn't lead to a single drop of water being saved. It doesn't lead to a single gram of carbon being prevented from being released into the atmosphere. It can't. The concept of a carbon footprint is a statistical abstraction, not an actual thing. Individuals reducing their carbon footprint doesn't actually reduce the amount of carbon being emitted by our civilization. It's only when statistically significant percentages of the population undertake change that any real world effects take place.

This really only applies to a global scale. You&#39;d have to force the market itself to stop buying so much meat... but at that point millions of businesses would be eliminated. I think that a better farming method, along with less meat in our diet could help with this problem, but don&#39;t think you&#39;re saving the earth by becoming a vegan.

It will reduce the amount of CO2 emitted but it&#39;s not solving the problem. The problem lies in the pre-historic storages of carbon which ARE NOT part of the modern cycle. People forget that we live in a closed system (almost) and there is a physical law called conservation of mass. Feel free to argue with me.

Replace beef in chili or tacos for beans, add extra garlic and/or onions for extra flavor. <br />2. Do a veggie pot pie (use veggie broth and no meat), super easy to replace! <br />3. Don&#39;t get bacon or sausage on your breakfast sandwich, an egg &amp; cheese is still good! <br />4. Restaurants usually don&#39;t have an issue with you swapping the meat in the dish for something else. ex) Instead of chicken on your Greek wrap, get falafel or artichokes or extra cheese (never pay more to swap for basic veggies! The meat is the most expensive part!) <br />5. A lot of &quot;meat products&quot; (like &quot;beef&quot; burritos) use textured vegetable protein as a filler and it&#39;s really good on it&#39;s own! Soak it in water then crisp up in a sauce pan with spices, super easy! I do this a lot for chili, shepherd&#39;s pie, etc <br />6. Some &quot;meat products&quot; actually aren&#39;t, like some beef burritos (said above) or bacon bits. Read the labels, you&#39;d be surprised!<br />7. I found ground beef to be the easiest meat to replace in recipes (except for burgers of course, you can&#39;t replace a good cheeseburger!) <br /><br />No shame in eating meat, it&#39;s natural for humans. But every effort counts, even if you just eat vegetarian once in a while. Glad you read my tips and I hope it helps!

"Plant based" doenst have to be complicated or *expensive*. It can if you want it to be. Its only when you're looking for faux products in replacement for animal flesh or specialty foods.

There's nothing special or unique about meat that would stimulate evolution. Many theorize it was the discovery of fire. The brains preferred source of fuel is glucose, and cooking caused the breakdown of starches and cellular walls which allowed for easier digestion, quicker nutrient assimilation, and a reduced amount of food-borne illnesses. This is far more logical and aligns with how evolution works, since it wasn't the chemical composition of the food that created adaptation, but the change in its structure. And I'm ok with lab-griwn meat. It's not healthy at all, but at least no animal dies & the planet isn't harmed.

I'm 42 years old. On average nothing has changed in my lifetime. Based on things I have seen and read from times before I was born, nothing has changed in a century. There is empirical evidence that proves no change has happened. Where is your examples of "problems that we are seeing?"

Here&#39;s the problem with this: cows can only release co2 they eat as food so basically growing crops for tomorrow&#39;s cows absorbs ALL the co2 released by today&#39;s cows, so there is no NEW co2 released into earth&#39;s atmosphere WHERAS with gasoline the co2 was absorbed by plants that lived millions of years ago when the co2 content of air was waaaaay higher ERGO you can go vegan if you want to but you will make exactly 0 difference ☺	UCDyw_mWFaVY0g184m2MgKww	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDyw_mWFaVY0g184m2MgKww	0

Some occasions 3 times but mainly my meat of choice is chicken. I would actually eat fish more often but it’s something that doesn’t really agree with my taste spuds but I’m willing to try to eat red meat only once a week and replace it with trying to stick to a Mediterranean or a proper Israeli diet and maybe a couple times a week try dishes that contain no meat.<br /><br />However and I’ll brace myself for the comments on 3 2 1...I do refuse to go Vegan simply because it’s hard enough with Kosher XD but also not just my religion’s traditions say at times you should eat or consume meat but my simple philosophy is that you take a look at the world around us and all across the animal kingdom there are animals that eat other animals in order to survive and gain nourishment. I do agree with the philosophy that humanity is too destructive with our desire to raise and heard life stock for consumption and there can be more environmentally friendly ways to do it but for thousands of years we’ve been consuming animals and haven’t gone extinct from it.<br /><br />If you want to go Vegan, hey that’s cool, you do you with your body but for all the over enthusiastic Vegans climb down off your high horse there could be ways you’re destroying yourselves that you may not realise so don’t try to judge others without living in their shoes First	UCqG-rBRqO5udVeWYXNxQgxA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqG-rBRqO5udVeWYXNxQgxA	0

Pasture based ecologies already exist, making it very easy to produce healthy food (i.e. red meat) in a sustainable way.<br /><br />But agriculture? Do you have any idea how much water corn has drained from America&#39;s underground aquifer? Plus, pastured based meats don&#39;t eat a lot of corn and other grains (they shouldn&#39;t). THEY EAT GRASS! <br /><br />I&#39;m against veganism, which is obviously unhealthy. Neither fruits nor vegetables are &quot;natural&quot; per se. They are man made GMO&#39;s that came about from the cultivation of agriculture. You actually think you&#39;ll find watermelons and bell peppers in a natural field or forest? Why on earth would any plant grow such absurd things without human intervention?	UCwl1OHHJ6gwqMlkjpPoQOhQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwl1OHHJ6gwqMlkjpPoQOhQ	0

Why should I listen to someone who can&#39;t even get that right?<br />3. He explicitly says his steak is from a &quot;grassfed&quot; animal, yet he still wants to cut back on it. Why?

Obviously reduction in meat consumption would be a fantastic way to go, I despise steak and other heavy meats, only like ground beef on occasion. But a lot of these statistics are off. The U.S produces a vast majority of its own food, in the U.S, 9% of pollution is from agriculture, including livestock. Transportation is 28%, that&#39;s almost a 4 fold difference. Not to mention the U.S is by far the largest agricultural giant in the world, and consumes massive amounts of meat. I would however note, quite a lot of livestock eat food we cannot, such as grass. And wildly processed corn that doesn&#39;t do us much good, and in areas where other plants like beans can&#39;t grow year round. Accounting for pollution for agriculture has far too many variables, that aren&#39;t always accounted for.	UC2daqn6MZhcfxiXkLuyIOAA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2daqn6MZhcfxiXkLuyIOAA	0

Since it&#39;s pretty reliant on fish it would mean a huge increase in the already bad amounts of overfishing in the world if that sort of diet would replace meat eating. Also a lot of farm animals, especially cows are raised for dairy production which too would increase if everyone cut back on meat. <br /><br />In the long run, the only real sustainable diet in the world will be the vegan one. But for now atleast, every little difference matters.	UCbG2uxK9x2iBH8SWMn8G1Fg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbG2uxK9x2iBH8SWMn8G1Fg	0

Because that’s not at all what the video said.<br /><br />They mention how eating meat DAILY is the issue. Moreso that we prefer slower growing, gassier animals like cows to eat. Chicken has like 1/4 of the methane emissions per pound compared to Cow; fish even less.<br /><br />If we found a way to fit in meals that cut back on our meat consumption, ones that we enjoy. I think over time we would find plant-based meals can be just as much of a comfort food. <br /><br />There’s no replacing your Grandma’s roast beef recipe, but you can make things like it a real special occasion when you don’t eat it once every week or so.<br /><br />Please don’t think I’m someone who follows this advice yet. I live with four people who I share meals with and convincing them requires a total upheaval of what they expect to eat for dinner and even lunch and breakfast. We all grew up with meat as the “All American” thing.<br /><br />The thing we all CAN share even if we’re not Americans is to say “I care about our planet and I want to see human’s impact on its climate reduced.” That is something you can change. <br /><br />If we simply talk to people and you work to change habits over time, we can all do this together.

However we need a lot of people to make that choice! My health has improved drastically since ditching meat and I actually don't crave it. However I can see that some people do....so I would just say that if you do your best to eat less meat...then good for you. Just do what you can. I'm sure over time, as you realise how good plant based foods taste, you'll naturally decrease meat consumption.

Until recently I also wouldn’t eat fish on the same principle, I ignored that I would eat fishsticks, or breaded and fried shrimp and enjoy them, and only focus on the times I found it to be undesirable. One thing I couldn’t see the world doing is even trying to go vegan until we can give up things like eggs, honey, ALL MILK PRODUCTS(this one kills me inside thinking of, as I enjoy the flavor of things made with cream, cheese and butter). Baked good exist in every single culture. I wonder what kind of foods would exist in a mostly vegan one. Is there anything exploitative about baking soda? Not that it would be very relevant, if you take the idea of being vegan for morality’s sake then you have to seriously question if you consider plants life and if you’re exploiting them by killing them for harvest, and only occasionally continuing their family genetics. We clone plants to increase the genetic representation of a trait we want. Like how we have all of a certain avocado(Haas?) being cloned from the same plant, I forget all the details. There is also technology being developed to let all organisms express genes differently, forcibly. Where do we draw the line through the shades of gray? What could everyone who isn’t in with or actually a politician themselves do to save Net Neutrality? I’ve contacted my representatives in Congress and they’re all historically against something like the repeal. And yet I feel as though I’m trying to fight the wind itself by blowing back at it.

Buying more beef to try and “cull the numbers” just creates a bigger demand and more cows to be grown in the future. It was grown to age and then slaughtered. It was flayed open, organs removed, and drained of blood. Then it’s off to a shop where it gets sectioned and cut. After that, “high quality” cuts are less than 1/4 of the total meat yielded. Every steak you buy is the end result of a cow’s entire life, that includes everything it’s ever eaten, every plant it’s ever stepped on, and of course...all the times it has pooped, farted, or belched. THOSE are the emissions we care about. All the wasted byproducts are extremely easy to measure in small quantities, but there is quite a lot of time passing and a lot of those byproducts are made. (READ: cows belch, fart, and poop a lot. They’re really inefficient at digesting, which is why they eat everything multiple times) So, while there are ways that we can reduce the damage it does to the land to actually bring cows out to pasture. It’s probably not really much less methane emissions when compared to raising a cow in much more inhumane conditions. If you ignore all of the talk about why we don’t like the downsides to our system of obtaining meat...there is still the problem of how much of it goes to waste. I can attest to cooking and throwing out the leftovers of much larger meals than I need to. Yet it feels easier to just buy more food than to eat ALL the leftovers myself. EDIT: To more directly answer your point, we should just eat meats in general LESS OFTEN. Don’t feel guilty about your steak unless it personally bothers you that an animal was specifically raised and slaughtered for your dinner to reach your plate. People around the world farm-raise livestock of all kinds for their meat. Cows, chicken, fish, pigs, sheep, and goats are just most of the examples. Nobody can say that we should forsake our culture as humans without having to answer “why is that something worth changing?” And that’s always something related to personal identity. Let’s all just enjoy that we have different opinions and try harder to be conscious about the impact we have on the world and people around us.

Also, the tired argument that vegan diets are better for the animals is crap - if everyone adopted it all the livestock would just be culled.

Fox eat cats, coyote eat dog, whales eat a bunch of fishes who may or not be carnivores but fish are not mammals. If you look at any food chain there are consumers and producers. Producers(plants) make food of the sun. Consumers(anamals) who are anamals which eat plants or consume each other for there energy and those who do both. Humans are herbivores but they mainly eat meat and berries till they invented farming.

I was probably going to stick with my normal single patty beef burger. Another girl before asked for the veggie burger and I didn&#39;t know it was on the menu nor have I had it before. When it was my turn to order, I got the same thing as her. I&#39;m glad I bought it, and to be honest it tasted exactly like a beef burger.

Well in order to understand how CO2 is affecting the environment you first have to understand what a greenhouse gas is and how it warms up the atmosphere. Here is a link explaining what it is http://www.dnrec.delaware.gov/climatechange/pages/greenhouse%20effect.aspx If you don’t want to read that link here is a decent explanation. Basically when solar radiation enters the Earth’s atmosphere it does so mostly in the form of visible light (The yellow light we see). When that enters the atmosphere and hits the surface of the Earth, it is absorbed. The earth then emits this same energy it absorbed in the form of infrared radiation back into the atmosphere. Without any greenhouse gases the IR radiation would just pass through the atmosphere and back into space. However, when greenhouse gases such as CO2 are in the atmosphere some of the heat is absorbed by the gas molecules and then sent back to the Earth’s surface. Some of this effect is a good thing as it keeps Earth warmer than freezing cold and keeps the temperature fairly even throughout the globe. However too much of the CO2  and you get too much warming and it has adverse effects. Currently that’s what is happening. We humans are pumping too much CO2 into the environment causing too much of the greenhouse effect and thereby warming the planet too much. If you want to understand how the IR energy/radiation is absorbed by you need a bit of chemistry knowledge. Conceptually when a molecule absorbs IR radiation the bonds of the molecule to stretch or bend until eventually the IR radiation is re-emitted back towards the earth essentially trapping the IR radiation within the atmosphere. This is the greenhouse gas effect. Only certain molecules can absorb IR radiation. These molecules have dipoles (difference in charges between atoms) between bonds. This enables the stretching and bending of the intramolecular bonds.	UC463eN99ys4YYkUcRir3Z6A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC463eN99ys4YYkUcRir3Z6A	1	Ugy3kIAaxvMawtLzg4h4AaABAg	Dillan

According to the Institute for Energy research “The United States produces nearly 1.1 billion short tons of coal a year, making it the world’s second largest coal producer. China produces over 3.5 billion short tons a year.” That’s a total of 4.6 billion short tons total which is equal to 4.08*1012 kg or 4.08 trillion kg of C burned a year. If we convert that into moles and then that into kgs we get 1.5*1013 kg or 15 trillion kg of CO2 produced a year by the US and China ALONE.Hopefully at this point you are convinced that humans produce a lot of CO2.

(fear of missing out) The non-FOMO way to look at is as an opportunity to discover the huge variety of amazing tastes in the plant world. FOMO is irrational. There's more in the world than anyone can ever experience. When you're having so much delight with plant foods (and you will if you do it right), there's no reason for FOMO - your plate and palate are overflowing.

But if you exercise hard and not consume meat, you are just eating yourself slowly, so meat is indeed necessary in certain circumstances. Still people are free to eat meat if they want to, and considering the little effect human activity has on the natural process of global warming I would say it&#39;s okay.

Telling people angrily to completely cut out animal products makes people resist that message but explaining to just do your best to cut back would have a greater impact and would probably save more animals in the long run. As people cut back they will start to realize how much better they feel or how easy it can be and then may cut it out completely.

Do the research for yourself, read multiple studies on both sides and come to your own conclusion, and then keep researching and be open to change if that should ever be your conclusion. Keep learning and being open, that’s what makes humans human, we can constantly learn and grow. This is not the only science based opinion on diet and it’s affect on climate... so people need to stop getting weirdly personal in the comments. If you have other studies or videos you’d like to share maybe link to those and share knowledge? Wouldn’t that be a cool world? I’m crazy I know.

There are much more effective ways of reducing climate change than unnatural and politically-charged diet change. Family planning, crop management, industrial pollution reduction.

(Meat being more calorie dense)<br />There was a study somewhere saying eating meat was better in terms of calroie per carbon output when shipping, and given that most foods are shipped globally and nationally how does this affect overall carbon in someone&#39;s diet?

Obviously, it makes a difference - but only on the macro level. Like, if I decide not to have meat half the time - and me alone - it probably <b>won&#39;t</b> reduce carbon emissions... it&#39;ll probably just mean that meat I would have eaten will get thrown out... <br /><br />Sure, it&#39;s good... but I guess I just feel like we need to do something way more radical than just... trying to make some people change their diet. Like, how about actually making a LAW about how much meat can be made, so the change is immediate and people are <b>forced</b> to change their diet?

So like, what would the &quot;natural&quot; footprint of the animals that would have been there anyway (like if we hunted instead of the kinda institutionalized approach, or just relied on the animals own habit as opposed to actively breeding them) been? Cause we are gonna have prey animals around us either way right? So is it possible to actively shrink our stock population sizes to reflect what might have been there anyway?

So to answer your question, ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. But probably not as much as you would think. Beef production in particular requires 12x the carbon emissions as the same nutritional value of plants. So it takes a lot of coal to equal one cow.	UC9ieQTNSW_d46nrT0BAymVA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9ieQTNSW_d46nrT0BAymVA	1	UgwM3THjKuLxAxrZTcl4AaABAg	R C

If my family and I go vegan they still clear cut the land, grain feed cattle, slaughter butcher and freeze meat! The reality is we need a certain thresh hold of people to go vegan in order to actually effect the overall global demand of meat and that is just the beginning of stopping the cycle which is damaging not just the end consumer choice. The lifestyle consumption fix to climate change is not very effective.	UCsDMMvrVN26jUlYqKICWqUw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsDMMvrVN26jUlYqKICWqUw	0

It's to stop the cycle of excess breeding. Also It's more than just methane & carbon emissions. Animal agriculture use 1/3 of the world's water, 1/3 of the world's fuel, cause desertification of the land, soil depletion, and dump massive amounts of fecal waste into our waterways (leading to hypoxic dead zones). Let's not forget the deforestation, displacement of indigenous ppl, 3rd world starvation due to corporate land grabs & manipulation of food trade prices, wildlife extinction bc the cattle industry lobbies for hunting mandates that kill off land competitors, sealife extinction bc of the excessively exploited fishing & due to the fact that cattle are fed fish pellets. There's also the matter of our taxes paying all the subsidies for meat. If we cut out meat, it would create an economic boom for us bc we'd reduce the amount of taxes & allocate them towards infrastructure or allow us to generate consumer spending towards other industries.

I&#39;m not trying to doubt your plan is a great one but I want to hear plans on what we&#39;re going to do with the rest of the livestock when we do reduce our meat consumption? and what are the methods that can be used that are more greener or eco-friendly when caring for livestock?. what kind of machines are we going to build that won&#39;t take so much water to feed animals or can we genetically modified crops where they have more calories and nutrients so animals won&#39;t consume so much and they can stay healthy.

Way to go for plant-power!<br /> Although we shouldn&#39;t enforce going vegan and at least vegetarian, the 90% or more reduction is meat is plausible to advocate now and this is perhaps the only media source I&#39;ve heard openly addressing this with millions of followers/subscribers. There may be a few other sources also getting on board but when this can be a regular discussion then the ambiguity around this can fall apart leaving just hard pressed arrogance to duel with. <br /> I noticed in this episode that they skimmed over the facts here and even left out the specifics (unsurprising) for why the data between vegan, vegetarian and mediterranean seems rather indistinguishable, which may give the misconception to individuals that mediterranean and vegetarian consumption is no different the veganism. &quot;Go have the salmon!&quot;, maybe not for long. Of course it&#39;s better option than something like beef, but that doesn&#39;t have to be the end point. This where detailed facts need to come in, otherwise will be play along to confirmation biases, defense mechanisms and logical fallacies that gets us nowhere closer to a sustainable and more healthful future. <br /> We can be sympathetic to cultural ingrained ideologies when it comes to food, but to remain cyclical about it pardons no one when there&#39;s a continual stream of access to factual information showing erred in reason. <br />A meal a day, a week or two with out animal products is a great first step.

Was the PERFECT solution! Take a small amount of grain, convert old, unused factories into "cricket condos" & make "cricket flour", increasing the grain's protein 150times & producing a nutty tasting powder that can be added to foods for a flavour & protein boost, all while providing employment options for out of work industrial workers & breathing new life into dying towns. Please consider supporting these sorts of systems people!	UCZsUD6fbggZVj-l6XcBrPdw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZsUD6fbggZVj-l6XcBrPdw	1	UgwuZ3GZh41yG0sRDeZ4AaABAg	punkrockviking

I think you can still fight climate change and having a lifestyle that doesn't contribute to the problem. I'm saying this with love and respect, not to cause an argument or a fight.

UgxxLA6FMkJyXD2eJkR4AaABAg.8a4UTB__nDF8nW9Y52dkSW		0	2018-11-11 13:17:25	MartínSQ	First off, about your first paragraph. You say that if, as I say, most people agree on basic logical truths, then automatically they'll agree on all complex statements (regarding philosophy, ethics, etc.). First off, this is clearly empirically untrue because of the wide array of opinions lots of people have in most matters (even if in some matters, like veganism, this array is not so wide, and more polarized). But it's also fairly understandable how come it be that humans with common basic moral truths arrive at different conclusions. Firstly, because not all humans have similar experiences at all, and lots of them stray them further from objective reasoning, or just don't even allow them (or make it difficult to do so) the questioning of certain accepted statements. Secondly, because the brain is a really complex system, and different brains are very different. It's understandable that most brains arrive at the same basic logical truths, because as I said they're mostly based in the observation of the world (even if they can later be expressed as formal logic) and we all are familiar with them to achieve the simplest of tasks. Complex truths that are built upon them, on the contrary, usually have to pass through a lot of observations and steps to be achieved, and something can go wrong in them. If the brain were a perfect computer, a formal system, that wouldn't happen. But the brain is a neural network with way too many connections (and physicality) to assure perfection in reasoning. There are just lots of other things (prejudices, biases, or plain malfunction) that are going on in the brain and prevent a proper formal argument. That's why one can hold as true certain basical truths, and simultaneously hold as true some more complex truth which contradicts them. That's called cognitive dissonance. So I of course wasn't stating veganism is right "because I believe so". I was arguing for veganism that eating animals contradicts the two basic truths I stated (maximize pleasure/minimize pain and that animals suffer and feel). And so, since these truths are accepted by most as obvious, and veganism on the other hand is a complex real issue, it's a strong argument that veganism is in fact correct, given it's the only option to follow these truths coherently. Now: you tell me those two truths don't imply veganism. But consider: if the animal is suffering, that clearly isn't worth the taste of meat. If, on the other hand, the animal is living a perfectly enjoyful and free life (which is NOT the case in more than 95% of the meat produced), killing him is still immoral, for you are depriving him of the pleasure he could have felt in the rest of his life (of course, if the animal is killed way before its life expectancy, which is always done in the industry). You may tell me, that by killin him painlessly we're just not inflicting any damage on it. But, though it clearly is better than killing him painfully, negating his life is clearly a moral prejudice, and a big one. You would never consider killing a person ethical just because it was done painlessly. And don't get me wrong: I'm not saying it's as bad to kill a nonhuman animal as to kill a person. I'm just using the example because the situation is analogous: a sentient being who wants to live will be negated the rest of his life. As another way to put it, you could say that, no matter how well you've treated the animal BEFORE killing him, at the moment of killing him you're committing a moral inconsistency just the same. And even more: if you've cared about the animal's wellbeing enough to treat it well until then, what does you suddenly consider it acceptable to prejudice him, to negate him such joy that he would live. And that's without entering in the matter that if we really had to care for all animals well, having them enjoyful and free, we'd quickly run out of space and resources. And on the other hand, a vegan diet utilizes 10 times less terrain (and some researchers even say 18 times less), and thus way less water, work, etc. and is thus way better for the environment. And also would allow to produce way more food, which would be good for humanity (I'm not saying the problem of people starving would be fixed by veganism, because we already produce 130% of the necessary food, but certainly more food would help).

UgxxLA6FMkJyXD2eJkR4AaABAg.8a4UTB__nDF8nTyQ1jfKf7		0	2018-11-10 16:52:59	kalzoa	@MartínSQ Well, I'm glad we agree on moral absolutism. That's a good start. You talk about atomical "truths" which most humans see as obvious. Then you go on to say that we have a global basic notions about the world which basically all of us can agree on. But then you start to say that just because the vast majority agree on these notions doesn't mean the vast majority will be right about any moral issue. So, if by your logic, the humans across the entire world have similar experiences and reasoning capabilities just as you do. If over 99% of them come to the conclusion that something is okay to do, what makes that 99% wrong and the 1% right? At the end of the day everyone believes they are right, so the argument can't just be "I'm right because I believe I'm right", obviously there is some factor that brought the 99% percent of human beings on Earth to the same logical conclusion. Now let's go over your logical reasoning for a second. You start by saying that people agree that it's better to maximize pleasure and minimize pain, I agree. As such, it would be wrong to unnecessarily beat your dog, or any animal for that matter. But then you make a leap to the logical conclusion that ergo eating animals is wrong, how so? Pain can be minimized in an animals death and no animal has to be beaten to obtain meat, so by your own logic meat is still okay so long as the animal was treated well and killed swiftly. Obviously, these factors do depend on where you get your meat but clearly you can see why others may come to a different logical conclusion that you have.

UgxxLA6FMkJyXD2eJkR4AaABAg.8a4UTB__nDF8nTjXHHH6kn		1	2018-11-10 14:42:54	MartínSQ	I know what moral absolutism is, and I am not advocating for that in such a strict sense as you present. Of course there are no "Absolute moral truths" if by that you search for something which is absolutelly context-independent. That's because literally nothing in the universe is context-independent. But we here, on Earth, and in our society, have some context (for instance, being alive, or an animal, or a human being) which imply almost all of us will have some atomical "truths" in common which we see as obvious. I'm talking about purely logical and formal truths, which are the necessary bricks of every good argument ever made. Of course there's not a way to metaphysically dictate that those truths are absolute or even correct. We've just experienced for unnumerable instances that, when facing the world using logic and reason (even the most basic one, like "I want that food, so I'll extend my hand to grab it"), it has come out well. That's to say, we have a global experience, as sentient beings, of some basic notions about the world which basically all of us can agree on. From there, we can build by reasoning and observing the world. Saying the vast majority agree on these basic bricks is not to say the vast majority will be right about any moral issue, for the real world and human relations distort our reasoning (and our brain isn't perfect), so we fail in our argumentations a lot (and some issues, we don't even think about). But given, for instance, that almost all actual people will agree that it's better to maximize pleasure and minimize pain (utilitarian) and that most animals have sentience and feelings, as shown by science, (and both these assumptions are clearly shown by the fact that, for instance, almost all actual people will see unnecessarily beating up a dog as bad), just from those two it's possible to reason, only with basic logical truths, that eating animals is wrong (because, basically, it creates too much pain for them and too little pleasure for us).

It's the ethical belief that there are absolute standards against which moral questions can be judged and that certain actions are right or wrong, regardless of the context of the act. Almost no ethical philosophers on the planet believe in moral absolutism for good reason. In order for something to be a moral absolute, it has to universally agreed to be either morally right or morally wrong in every possible scenario. No such moral standard exists, because if there exists any gray area then it can't be a moral absolute. Examples: 1) Stealing is wrong; except when it's to feed your family. 2) Killing is wrong; except when it's in self-defense. 3) Rape is wrong; except in a situation like the Handmaids Tale where only a handful of women could still reproduce and if they don't have sex then humanity will go extinct. The last one is a bit of a stretch I'll admit, but the point is that if there exists any exceptions then it can't be an absolute.

And so if you were to live in a society were raping is seen as correct, you'd automatically see raping as something morally correct and thus accept it or even perpetrate it?

What is legal in a society is typically what the vast majority view as correct or ethical. Is it moral for a 60-year-old man to sleep with a 16-year-old girl? In America it isn't because we view girls under 18 as children and thus have made such an act illegal. Yet, in some other countries, a 16-year-old girl is considered an adult and such an act would be seen as normal. Because humans can't always agree on right or wrong we go by majority rules, and the majority say eating an animal for food is okay while raping someone is wrong. If you disagree then go somewhere where raping is considered okay, though I don't know if such a place even exists.

I am fully vegan now, but it took me years to finally get there. The final step of my journey was two-fold, that my father-in-law was dying of Alzheimer's disease and my husband had stage 4 Prostate cancer. My father-in-law is now dead and my husband's surgery got all the cancer but we are due for his one year check-up soon in November. Before that, my mother, sister and mother-in-law, all died of breast cancer. I had had terrible arthritis in my hands so I gave up all dairy. Whenever I cheated and had cheese on a pizza or ate ice cream, I'd regret it. I started buying veggie burgers for our dog as she was alleging to all grains because of genetically modified foods. Now I enjoy the veggie burgers. I feel more alert, not in a brain fog. I no longer need to take sleep medication to get a full night's sleep. I've lost 35 lbs. I still am losing weight but at age 65, the weight does not come off fast. But it is enough to bring down my cholesterol, never had high blood pressure and my blood sugar is now right where it should be. You can learn to enjoy your food no matter what it is. Visit a Japanese steak house and order tofu, when it is prepared properly, it is delicious. Or go to an Indian restaurant and ask what are the vegan dishes. Eat those, you will be satisfied. Now I eat about 1/3 raw and the rest cooked. And I am not tempted to go back to the old way of eating. I had to take care of my father with Alzheimer's disease. Our children should not have that sort of burden and if my husband and I take better care of ourselves, we will be there to play with our grand children, not have to join them in diapers because we lost our minds. What sort of future do you want? The average person at retirement age is on 10 medications. I don't have to take any. I've gotten my husband off of dairy and soda pop, his blood pressure came down on its own, he did not need a the pills. He is devoted to eating meat as if to give it up would kill him, actually the opposite is true. But we prove what we want to prove to ourselves. I studied how I could cure my arthritis and I got hooked on doing research and finding a new adventure in how I could eat to improve my health. Is your health as important to you as mine is to me? I don't have skin cancer and I have no signs of any kinds of cancer. My sister died as 64, and I am a year older than she lived. She suffered dreadfully. My hope is someday, to go in my sleep being as healthy as possible to my dying day.

If you care so much about the environment, what exactly is stopping you from making dietary changes which snowball into much bigger environmental benefits than solar panels, hiking and wilderness activism? I'm sorry if I sound harsh but have you thought of why?	UCnSJ1iFijva_eRcRc6ziUeg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnSJ1iFijva_eRcRc6ziUeg	1	UgxxLA6FMkJyXD2eJkR4AaABAg	SubFeed Sub

Then I went vegetarian, and then i started swapping out milk products, and then I realised that it was silly that I was still eating eggs when I was so close to being vegan, so I stopped eating eggs.

The fishing industry does tonnes of damage to the ocean. They usually don&#39;t just pull up fish in the nets, they pull up sea turtles and dolphins etc. And they leave behind pollution like fishing nets, which whales often end up eating, and dying.<br />The amount of overfishing that is going on is unsustainable for the ocean. The entire ecosystem could collapse eventually if we continue at the current rate.<br />And everyone switching from beef to fish isn&#39;t going to help.<br />So eating chicken would probably be better than fish. <br />But veganism is by far the most environmental, and ethical opinion.

It will also lead to less obesity (think of the Co2 savings of not driving around 400 pound people), more fresh water (beef uses 33% of all available global fresh water) and fewer medical costs (14 trillion is lost yearly to preventable diseases related to meat consumption.)<br /><br />Plant based foods are also delicious last night I had black bean and sweet potato tacos with coconut yogurt and pineapple salsa. My nut cheese and swiss chard salad is very very good too.	UCQk04Dg9l6cMjCqfuVxEnNQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQk04Dg9l6cMjCqfuVxEnNQ	0

It doesn't matter how efficient your food is, whether it takes two or ten or 500 g of carbon dioxide to produce, if it is wasted it becomes infinitely inefficient. Like flying empty planes around the world. Being a little more vigilant about wasted food can offset your meat eating by a huge amount.

We don&#39;t breed cows anymore and by doing so we cut back on beef, <br />we all drink black coffee and wear less leather. <br />That gives more room for humans so we can start having 4 children each. <br /><br />Although we have to kill off all living cows and quickly. Each seconds wasted is more cow farts going into the air.<br />So vegetarians, you guys have to help out with eating all that beef before it goes bad.<br /><br />Sorry to say but this is stupid and very short term thinking. Long term thinking?<br />Invest in long term projects and look to scientists to help us get there. <br /><br />ffs why is everything so profit driven? Get political leaders that&#39;s not all about making money and promoting loans <br />for houses and education, thus enslaving you for the next 30 years working for something you could&#39;ve had for free hundreds of years ago.<br />Sure earth is over populated, but is the rest of our galaxy or universe overpopulated?<br /><br />There&#39;s around 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 planets in our observable Universe, <br />roughly speaking and sure some of them are uninhabitable, but that&#39;s just it. <br />Our human bodies are holding us back. Think of a movie like Transcendence. <br />Imagine having robotic bodies that doesn&#39;t need air or water and doesn&#39;t age.<br /><br />Suddenly when you tell someone it takes a life time to space travel or there&#39;s no air or water on mars it doesn&#39;t seem like such a problem. <br />I would say, as we&#39;re (quite possibly) one of the only living organisms in the universe, we should spread out and bring life to the stars.<br /><br />Elect someone like Michio Kaku your president or political leader. People who vote for popularity contests shows you the flaw in<br />democracy. It&#39;s not who&#39;s most skilled or intelligent or qualified for the job, it&#39;s all about being a good orator or &quot;being the 1st female<br />president which is, sorry to say, so primal and primitive and thinking like animals. <br />I thought we had what the little life we found so far in the universe doesn&#39;t have, intelligence.

There is an alarming amount of growth in precarity since the end of XX century and that pushes the middle class to go for cheap transportation and cheap groceries. The food industry has a total libertinage on how to produce their food, and governments have little or almost no power to regulate anything at all. So &quot;asking&quot; people to be conscious is just one part of the job, the other part resides in a planned economy that can keep sustainable jobs and at the same time we could redistribute wealth so everyone could invest in sustainable sources of food/energy. But that sounds like socialism and people is so narrow minded that even not knowing what socialism is they just refuse it irrationally. It&#39;s not that human kind is stupid but easy manipulable.

You could eat carbs, veggies and meat as separate items (like with a steak) or you could eat a type of dish where everything is mixed (like lasanga). In that first case cutting out meat would indeed feel like your missing something but in the second it's less noticible. A lasanga without meat is still a lasanga. So my suggetion would be to eat more of those second type of dishes if you'd want to ease into a less meat based diet.

They produce larger, better tasting fruit and vegetables that are faster to mature and more durable to the elements with a longer shelf life. The issue is that small landowners in developing countries can't afford the added cost of the seeds and nobody will buy their regular produce when it's placed against a shiny GM product, but that has little to do with the environmental standpoint.

It's certain types of food, grown the right way from the right producer/distributor. Because each almond take 1 gallon of water to produce, even vegetables can be gmo'd, growing quinoa has a negative economic effect on Peru and Bolivia, and Avocados from Mexico are being controlled by a drug cartel.

Telling people to practice moderation will not get them to reduce their meat intake by 90%. Also, I&#39;m skeptical of the claims that vegetarian or Mediterranean diets have a similar environmental impact. I wish there was a link to the studies that back up those claims.

There are vegan bodybuilders & athletes who report that their recovery times & stamina have improved (that's bc of the reduced inflammation caused by diet), also they've broken world records.

But emissions are not the only damage animal products do to our planet; pollution, heavy toll on various resources, our health and of course the life of sentient beings that can easily be avoided. Please Vox, think broader then emissions, it&#39;s almost 2018 already! :)	UCZ8fiOgMT-Kxv2uPqVOWKsA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ8fiOgMT-Kxv2uPqVOWKsA	0

But when he said that the mediterranean diet isn&#39;t &quot;that much different&quot; than the vegan diet in terms of emissions, the graph actually shows that its double the amount of emissions. I think twice the amount of emissions is kind of still a big deal. Also if annyone wants to learn more about this topic in general, I recommend the documentary &quot;Cowspiracy&quot; (its on netflix)	UCpqduADfLrpfJSUJNEeqoZQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpqduADfLrpfJSUJNEeqoZQ	0

The main reason is probably desire: most people simply do not want to live like that. The second reason is that it could be a very unhealthy choice for some people because some bodies need more proteins that only meat can offer. I think what the video was recommending was just that we eat LESS meat, which is very reasonable and something everyone (and some people should) do.

It's basically like if doctors said we're going to solve the obesity crisis by saying that everyone should run a marathon a few times per week when most people need to just get some cardio for 30 min each day. How many people will actually going to start trying to run marathons? Its a lot more effective to get a lot more people to reach a smaller goal than by saying an extreme change is the only option.

Tried it because I was tired of the headaches, heartburn, haemorrhoids, brain fog, inflammation and constantly being tired. I really don't care what I eat I just wanted to feel normal. I'm currently on a carnivore diet and I feel the best on this one. As far as global warming goes. Methane only stays in the atmosphere for 12 years. Carbon Dioxide, however, stays for thousands of years.	UCMi-yBXHroBwPxMpk9FAQqw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMi-yBXHroBwPxMpk9FAQqw	1	UgwzWXInLZgQSuaGCHZ4AaABAg	martad

Maybe less animals are involved with consumption, but you still need cows to be alive to make your food. In fact, if you didn&#39;t kill any animals for their meat, you&#39;d just be keeping them alive past the point where we would usually slaughter them and they&#39;d be polluting more. Meat is just what happens to the cows when they&#39;re done making dairy, so how is vegetarianism much different from meat eating?

Cows and other herbivores actually allow grasses to absorb more carbon than is produced by grazing but, the problem is that most farms don&#39;t feed them what their naturally supposed to eat. Nor do &#39;modern&#39; farms usually allow animals to perform their ecological functions, which is the real source of the negative effects of agriculture on the ecosystem.

Even if everyone in the world went vegan, we&#39;d still be over the planet&#39;s carrying capacity if we didn&#39;t change anything else, so everyone needs to be doing as much as they possibly can. Eating fish might help with climate change, but it won&#39;t help with the fact that scientists predict by 2050 we will exhaust all global fishing reserves. Bluefin tuna, yellow tail, albacore wild Atlantic salmon, pacific salad, Japanese eel and many other popular fish are endangered or threatened. For every pound of fish you buy, another pound of by-catch animals is killed and thrown away	UCthJxyAmPSoF021l0GnG2SQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCthJxyAmPSoF021l0GnG2SQ	0

If I see everyone changing to a vegan/planet friendly diet, I think: hey, so many are already doing the job, I don&#39;t need to change a thing. Yeeeah, there&#39;s probably more people than just me thinking like that. We should make meat more expensive, but it&#39;s difficult to enforce that in a liberal market economy.<br />We already have a very large lower income class. If they can&#39;t afford meat as often, they will find something else - something more friendly to the planet.	UCjYLmtS5kmZadMoBhb-uRDw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjYLmtS5kmZadMoBhb-uRDw	0

It is by far one of the more expensive yet common meats. More expensive than pork and certainly more expensive than chicken and certain kinds of fish.<br /><br />Also I have a pretty nifty solution for food consumption and carbon emissions.. I say we role over the SIGs like fanatic christians whom condemn cloning and ramp that research up to 11 out of a possible 5 so we can start cloning meat already! Cheaper than raising animals and certainly faster than both farming and ranching combined! Sure it&#39;ll pretty much be like having ground beef, processed pork and chicken nuggets for life but then those ranchers have the freedom to treat the animals and meats like artisan cuts and we can have those luxuries every now and then as opposed to sinking all resources into having it every day am&#39;right?

As demand for fish increases, overfishing is likely to increase and we might see the extinction of many fish breeds as a result. Some measures such as aquaculture (raising fish in captivity) are helping to reduce stress on overfishing but they&#39;re not perfect.

I live in India, and literally see starving children almost every time I step out of my house. And it kills me to see so much water and grains going to feed animals, who would in turn be eaten by just a few people, rather than the grains going directly to people who could genuinely be saved from starvation. Moreover, anyone denying climate change, pollution levels in Delhi are no joke. When so many are suffering so much even just to breathe, EVERY little change helps. You don’t have to give up meat, just eat it less. Better for your body, better for the animals, better for the world. Please.

Also, suggesting that we eat more fish and less cows has a huge effect on our oceans. The more fish we eat the quicker our oceans die, which is where 70% of our oxygen comes from. Add that to all the deforestation and wild fires that are going on today and we are doomed. A vegan lifestyle or plant based diet is the way to go. There isn&#39;t anything extreme about it, in fact it is extreme to be eating the way we have been eating for all these decades. <br /><br />If you really want to make a difference, start by reducing your intake of animal products with the goal of going plant based. You can save the planet but let&#39;s not tip toe around the subject like this video is. <br />With love!	UCx1eKsVVzjNZYshG9t-MgoA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx1eKsVVzjNZYshG9t-MgoA	0

A cow can produce only so much meat, since it can only give meat once, obviously. As for fish, a large percentage of fish sold in stores is farm-raised. There are downsides to fish farms but it is a lot more sustainable than wild-caught.

That I agree with. We don't need some vegan feminist or whatever coming on and telling us that anyone who eats meat is evil. All that does is make people tune it out, because it's stupid. humans have been eating meat for millennia, ever since we discovered fire and could eat it without contracting disease. Lots of meat eaters understand that they eat too much meat, but by trying to tell them that the only option is to turn vegan or vegetarian, it makes people not want to do anything. But this video illustrated the different options for people who want to eat healthier and help the environment.

Veganism isn&#39;t the best thing for our planet just yet, and it&#39;s probably better for everyone to eat a bit of meat (once standards in the industry increase dramatically) and insects! There&#39;s a lot of room for improvement and I&#39;m excited for our food future, particularly as a chef who LOVES mushrooms, grains and a decent number of vegetables. &lt;3	UCACeNOXu6nkoA5ZicilAa5Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCACeNOXu6nkoA5ZicilAa5Q	0

The problem with that statement is that you haven't met every single vegan to make that blanket assessment. If you did meet us all, you'd find most of us keep to ourselves. And since you haven't met the majority of Vegans (obviously how could you, we're quiet for the most part), your focus is on the few loud obnoxious ones who like to use social media to apply their activism. Their noise overshadows those of us who live by example rather than vocalize. And I'm not even mad at them. Bc I get why they're so passionate. It's a good cause & the opposition is horrifying. The extreme behavior of those vegans is reactionary & relative to the extreme behavior of the meat industry. They have a right to be upset. They wish to speak on behalf of the voiceless & powerless. As obnoxious as they are, their message is altruistic. I don't understand why anybody would allow the messenger to get in the way of accepting the validity of the message. Bc that's what it comes down to: WHAT'S being said, not WHO is saying it. And yea it is too bad that the select few ruin it for the majority, but that's still not an excuse for us to not assess the movement for its empowering message.

Mediterranean diet is way more realistic. Also, in the future, humans will probably be eating lab-grown meat, so the emissions from meat will diminish over time. Plus, it&#39;s not smart to tell people to stop eating honey, because bee keepers are keeping the bee populations up. Also, eating crickets and meal worms are a great protein choice. I would totally eat that. I&#39;ve never thought it was a good idea to stop eating fish either. There&#39;s no better source of omega-3s and we need kids brains to be well developed if we are going to learn to terraform the planet and explore deep space. Vegans get way too worked up over small amounts of mercury. You know we give mercury to babies in vaccines. It&#39;s fine in trace amounts. Also you wouldn&#39;t stop eating nutmeg even though it could give you seizures if you eat more than 0.2oz.	UC019bltDxzpUfD0hb_YPxWA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC019bltDxzpUfD0hb_YPxWA	0

No civilization on Earth has ever sustained a plant-based diet because humans are evolved to be omnivores. Indigenous populations all over the world are relying heavily on hunting and fishing especially in the north where crops are impossible. It's always been a matter of balance when you take from the Earth. The way the first world is living 100% the cause. Capitalism is the only reason there is a problem now. You can't have places with limited resource and arable land to rely on plants. It's going to make globalism a necessity which means everyone depends on white government for food.

And those from the World Health Organization, Oxfam, UN, and Global Research have indicated agribusiness as the leading facilitator of land grabs. The demand for produce wouldn't drive up drought since meat is far more resource-intensive. Here are the figures: Lettuce -- 15 gallons; Tomatoes -- 22 gallons; Cabbage -- 24 gallons; Cucumber -- 28 gallons; Potatoes -- 30 gallons; Oranges -- 55 gallons; Apples -- 83 gallons; Bananas -- 102 gallons; Corn -- 107 gallons; Peaches or Nectarines -- 142 gallons; Mango -- 190 gallons VS Eggs -- 573 gallons; Chicken -- 815 gallons; Cheese -- 896 gallons; Pork -- 1630 gallons; Butter -- 2044 gallons; Beef -- 2500-5000 gallons I didn't say Indigenous ppl were vegans or cause of the problems. I said they were the victims. Due to agribusiness cutting down protected rainforests for raising livestock & animal feed, they've forced out natives from their homes. These lands are stolen from them just to satisfy us Westerner's tastebuds for a burger. I specifically mentioned the ocean's fisheries being depleted, over 85% to be exact. Based on your misinterpretation of my Indigenous comment, I'm not surprised you misread thin as well. And no its not just salt-water species. The excess manure that's being run off into waterways is creating algae-infested pools & hypoxic dead zones which kill all kinds of fish in lakes, rivers, saltwater basins & ocean. And it's not simply the indiscriminate manner that fishing employs, but also the growing populations' demand that is causing the fish to deplete. As China and India beginning to eat more meat-based, they'll also funnel in more demand. The population will grow to 10 billion by 2050. It seems that you want to maintain your cognitive dissonance & not admit to the impacts that one industry has. I haven't even touched on its lobbyist grip on Congress & how their Ag-gag law and hunting mandates prevent us from keeping these mafia-like corporations in check. I didn't even mention the environmental activists who are assassinated for speaking out or the ones who are placed on the FBI's terrorist watch list. The amount of corruption is real. But if you want to fund them just to keep your palate happy, then I hope your conscience is clear. I couldn't do it. I'd never allow my palate to have more power than my mind. For me, principle outweighs convenience. I often wonder on what side of history I'd have been on during Slavery Abolition or the Women's Suffrage movement. I'd like to think that based on my fight for the voiceless & powerless today, that I can confidently say I'd have been on the right side of history.

Capitalism is the factor that is killing the planet and not omnivors. And drought epidemic is only getting worse. If you increase the demand for local produce, many grocery stores around the world would have low stock poor stock. Indigenous people aren't vegan and never were. They are not the cause of environmental problems, capitalist Europe and America is because the world depends on only white dominated countries surviving. And it's the same problem with your fishing claim. Species are disappearing because humans aren't taking the procautions to save the *salt water* species. (Also, the oceans won't be empty of fish, it will be empty of edible fish withing the usual fishing spots. 95% of the ocean is undiscovered.)

Meat is actually the cause of world starvation bc livestock has lead to land desertification & soil depletion. Due to this issue, corporations have sought out land in 3rd world countries either by creating deforestation or via corporate land grabs. 91% of the amazonian deforestation is a result of animal agriculture. Corporate land grabs cause small local farms to be unable to compete. This causes much of these farmers to either sell their land or go bankrupt. The corporations gain control over food prices & drive them up so that they are able to export them to feed the livestock that will ultimately feed the wealthy West. 3rd world ppl lose jobs on farms & go into poverty. And the ones who can hold unto jobs can't afford the high prices driven by these corporations. Let's not forget our own economy stands to gain from cutting out meat since most of the industry takes its subsidies from our taxes. In regards to the fish, mercury is the least of our problems. Over 85% of fisheries are currently exploited & our oceans are expected to go extinct by 2048 if we continue at this rate. Our consumer demand leads to all kinds of problems I haven't even mentioned, the amount of fuel & water & land resources required is unsustainable. Deforestation leads to the displacement of indigenous ppl. Farmers in the US are trapped into horrible contracts & debt with the meat industry. Workers in meat factories deal with PTSD & food borne illnesses. Local citizens, who live by these farms, end up with illnesses as well. We're not just hurting the animals and our planet here, we're hurting humans! Our dollar is a vote for the kind of world we wish to live in. Be a responsible consumer. Be the change you wish to see.

Just because there is more food, does not mean that people will get fed. Businessed are not going to distribute food to those who need it just because they can. They can now and they don't. And algae is inadequate compared to fish oil. Not even close to the same levels. It's ok. I kind of expect it from vegans like to lie and make biased conclusions from dated and flawed scientific studies.

It's actually a compromise because you eat the right quantities and just what you need nothin more nothing less, it is a balanced diet which still implies a lot of fruit and vegetable intake. It is pretty sustainable and healthy too. So the thing is we should just balance our diet in a way that it doesn't impact a lot on the envirorment but at the same time it is right for you.

And lets be realistic, switching to fish WILL mean a lot more fish taken from the ocean. Overfishing is already a huge huge problem. Going vegan-or at least moving towards that direction is the only real solution. Plus, fish is nothign like meat in terms of taste or texture, so for people who enjoy meat, becoming vegan or semi-vegan will probably be no more difficult than switching to fish.

But in case of noticeable increase in fish consumption, companies in that sector would have to grow pretty fast to keep up with demand and their competitors. And while fish farms are more sustainable, actually building them takes time and has big upfront costs. So companies would probably opt for short-term profit instead of long-term sustainability and just fish in the ocean. I don‘t know, maybe I‘m just too pessimistic. But most companies don‘t have a great track record on favoring sustainability over profit.

And wtf? More beef? They're already raiding the rainforest for current production. You could already feed the world trice over with what is fed to the cattle. Adding more would require more food that's then missing for direct consumption. In fact, if you scale that up we'll all end up with a steak per week for our entire meal that week. Because there's no place left to produce any food that is not fed to the cattle.

The amount of resources for Grass-fed is even higher than Grain-fed livestock. Here's what it is just for Grain-fed: They use 1/3 of the world's water, 1/3 of the world's fuel, cause desertification of the land, soil depletion, and dump massive amounts of fecal waste into our waterways (leading to hypoxic dead zones). Let's not forget the deforestation, displacement of indigenous ppl, 3rd world starvation due to corporate land grabs & manipulation of food trade prices, wildlife extinction bc the cattle industry lobbies for hunting mandates that kill off land competitors, sealife extinction bc of the excessively exploited fishing & due to the fact that cattle are fed fish pellets. There's also the matter of our taxes paying all the subsidies for meat. If we cut out meat, it would create an economic boom for us bc we'd reduce the amount of taxes & allocate them towards infrastructure or allow us to generate consumer spending towards other industries.

Much old growth forest is being removed to make room for meat production related industry. So ultimately it's still better to not consume animals. The issue very complicated. But the best practice at this point would be to heavily remove animal products from your lifestyle if possible.

Also, humans have been consuming animal products for a LONG time before TV advertisements were invented. There are plenty of good arguments for eating less meat etc., you really don't need to make stuff up to get your point across.

The oestrogen, and other hormones, found in milk is a strong factor for certain cancers, such as breast and prostate, as mammals are not designed to consume the breast milk of other species of mammal. Countries with the highest consumption of milk are found to have the most cases of arthritis, osteoporosis and hip fractures. This is because consuming milk causes the blood to become acidic, to reverse the blood back to an alkaline state, the body leeches calcium out of the bones to use the phosphate to change the ph and then excretes the calcium. So the calcium in milk does not make our bones stronger	UCzwIpZzNMCr_51aM0jT2cJg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzwIpZzNMCr_51aM0jT2cJg	1	UgxY7n0GWcdhHJIRH5p4AaABAg	kundan luthra

They also create carbon emissions, use 1/3 of the world's water, 1/3 of the world's fuel, cause desertification of the land, soil depletion, and dump massive amounts of fecal waste into our waterways (leading to hypoxic dead zones). Let's not forget the deforestation, displacement of indigenous ppl, 3rd world starvation due to corporate land grabs & manipulation of food trade prices, wildlife extinction bc the cattle industry lobbies for hunting mandates that kill off land competitors, sealife extinction bc of the excessively exploited fishing & due to the fact that cattle are fed fish pellets. There's also the matter of our taxes paying all the subsidies for meat. If we cut out meat, it would create an economic boom for us bc we'd reduce the amount of taxes & allocate them towards infrastructure or allow us to generate consumer spending towards other industries.

What we need is changes that happen automatically: making electric cars &quot;cool&quot; is a good example. Imagine if cultured meat suddenly became much cheaper than animal meat, and we could grow it using clean energy. Imagine if all the farming machines and food transportation was incentivized to switch to electric, if it became the cheaper option. Imagine if clean energy became so cheap that it became viable to grow food indoors in vertical farms, and we could grow most crops locally and without pesticides or herbicides. Asking people to make lifestyle changes has never scaled, except when the change is something they want anyway like &quot;own a Tesla&quot; or &quot;buy cheaper food&quot;. There are plenty of good reasons to cut down on your meat consumption, but sadly it probably won&#39;t save the planet unless a majority does it. Imagine if all the meat in the world became infected with a debilitating pathogen...	UCaHZPr1S1KRGx7x-IUFXnrA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaHZPr1S1KRGx7x-IUFXnrA	0

What I'm trying to say is that someone might want to give up meat but struggle with it because it's hard to give up those memories. I think that the best way to give up meat would be through a slow and tedious yet gentle process with lots of encouragement along the way.

You know exactly why most of the world eats meat: because it tastes good. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand that. Food is more than just a source of energy, for most people, there are memories attached to them. Certain meals remind them of home or of their family or of good childhood times that have been destroyed by the harsh reality of adulthood. To give those things up is HARD and vegans/vegetarians never seem to be empathetic with those that struggle to do so. That's one of the real reasons that many dislike vegans/vegetarians so much, they shun those that eat meat but never stop to consider that maybe they want to but are finding it really hard to give up something that holds a lot of sentimental value to them. And also, let's be honest, meat substitutes never taste as good as real meat.	UCgoN3TjeqVrYaijowxsbdDQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgoN3TjeqVrYaijowxsbdDQ	1	UgyiIbovHdYxrAGH9r54AaABAg	Darth Pro

One animal calorie uses 9 plant calories, meat can&#39;t be used to feed the growing population.( Only 1st world countries regularly eat meat) Earth can just produce so much crops, it&#39;s a waste to feed them to animals plus the rainforest is getting decimated just to plant Soy for livestock.

Did you even read what you just wrote. Meat has 8x the amount of environmental impact that all of those things combined have. And it's more than just methane & carbon emissions. Animal agriculture uses 1/3 of the world's water, 1/3 of the world's fuel, cause desertification of the land, soil depletion, and dump massive amounts of fecal waste into our waterways (leading to hypoxic dead zones). Let's not forget the deforestation, displacement of indigenous ppl, 3rd world starvation due to corporate land grabs & manipulation of food trade prices, wildlife extinction bc the cattle industry lobbies for hunting mandates that kill off land competitors, sealife extinction bc of the excessively exploited fishing & due to the fact that cattle are fed fish pellets. There's also the matter of our taxes paying all the subsidies for meat. If we cut out meat, it would create an economic boom for us bc we'd reduce the amount of taxes & allocate them towards infrastructure or allow us to generate consumer spending towards other industries.

Beef raised on feedlots with maize in the US is different to beef raised mostly on grass from marginal (i.e. otherwise unusable) land in the UK or Ireland. While there are still considerations of methane emissions, the latter is not taking up land that could be used to grow crops for human consumption, nor are they (for the most part) consuming food that humans can eat.

Imagine that you have to literally coddle adults and make appeals to emotion that they can relate to. When you underperform at your job, you get feedback and try to adapt. Yet when it's your diet, most become incredibly stupid and defensive. ''You are right, but I really enjoy steak, so I won't change.'' I don't mind people slowly becoming vegan, but giving people a way out when it is subpar is incredibly disheartening to see. There won't be real change when people are given an alternative that will satisfy their conscience.

That's the hurdle, but with some intent it's quite easy to do :) Try some vegan dishes, and see whether you like them. It's honestly insanely surprising what all can be vegan. Just search any food and add "vegan" on Google. You seem like somebody rational, and the rational arguments for veganism are pretty hard to beat.

And that if you're poor like me you can't really eat meat no more than once or twice a month. So buy Meat that's more organic make it worth it especially if you're only doing it 3 times a month. And if you need more meat then stick some more chicken and fish. But that's my opinion.

It's even tastier than bacon. Honestly not all vegans are the same. Stop bringing up the existence of 'the aggressive vegan' to legitimize your own dependance on an unnecessary luxoury good like meat. Unnecessary? Yes, vegetarians and vegans prove it. Stop using them to say 'they hurt my feelings!' as the reason to continue while we can actually discuss consequences of eating meat.

You're not less unethical just because you haven't been convinced of changing your habits by "aggressive vegans". They were still right about you being selfish and irresponsible, even if that's not the best way to get you to listen to them. Sometimes vegans just want to get it off their chest that other people suck and they don't necessarily expect you to change because of what they say.

So you see how hard it is to live with us. They are elevated human beings in their minds who are above the mainstream bloodlust. This is their point of view and they are entitled to it. There is some truth to it. We who eat meat have decided we are better than animals and have the right to eat them. We are OK with killing a juicy lamb. So I guess we have to own up to it. But there are more steps between being a vegan or a meatatarian! Environment and animal rights are two scientific and humanistic povs we can find common ground on and help our planet.

That amount is enough to keep you well fed and strong, and also keep your greenhouse emissions under control. Just that would be a huge improvement by itself. Another step forward would be to understand what makes meat so satisfying for you personally and try to emulate that with other types of foods. For me, for example, it's about the fullness, meat is mostly protein which is very filling, so sometimes I just eat a salad with mozzarella cheese (high in protein and fats). The same goes for fish, especially one that doesn't stink, chicken, and tofu. It takes a while to find what you like but after a while it becomes part of your diet, not just a fancy replacement for beef. Being sensible in your food choices isn't about propaganda, it's about going away with our previously learned food habits, which can be very tough. That is why post people don't do it. p.s. They mentioned this about the mediterranean diet, but it might have slipped. It contains a lot of olive oil. When my mom makes a sallad, there's a ton of olive oil in it. And there's a good reason for it -- fats are tasty, very high in energy, and satiating, so they have the same effect as proteins. However, that doesn't go well with our Western teaching about the evil of fats. Not all fats are born equal, though; olive oil can be safely consumed in much larger quantities.

As soon as your purchase increases Supply you should feel at least a little bit guilty). Where would the liver end up otherwise?

Clazza, as OP mentioned just because animals do something in the wild does not at all mean it is ethical for humans to do that. We have a CHOICE to eat meat. People choose to eat meat because it tastes good even though it causes immense suffering to millions of factory farmed animals and is terrible for the planet. Wild animals do not have this choice. Also for people saying plants feel pain, do you really think that pain is comparable to what intelligent animals like pigs or cows feel? Many plants evolved to have part of themselves be eaten. Many flowering plants would not reproduce if animals didn't eat their fruit and spread their seeds. And to Jason Peng, veganism does require much less land than a traditional American omnivorous diet. First of all, livestock, especially grazing animals, require lots of land. And secondly, you have to feed the animals something. If humans ate what we fed to animals, that would be much more efficient and use much less land. Energy is lost at each trophic level, so when we eat a chicken that ate some grain, we gain 90% less energy than if we just ate all the grain the chicken ate.

However, veganism also takes away land from ecosystems, like forests and woods in which animals like goats are bred in. It consumes much more land because much more crops are consumed per day than meat (you probably eat around 200% more grain than chicken a day). Not only that, but many vegans consume market oil, which is developed from animal fat; animal fats are also used industrially very commonly. To take away these animal fats would require new replacements to be developed, which is costly and isnt always doable. Veganism has its arguments, and it has its counterarguments. If somebody doesn't want to be vegan or does, it's their choice, and you have no right to enforce what you don't even know is truly beneficial to the world on somebody else. Veganism is also not necessarily healthier. High protein, mineral and Carbohydrate consumption combined with high activity and physical stress builds muscle and develops the immune system much faster and more efficiently than vegetarianism. Many male athletes consume a lot of meat for a reason. That being said, without that high physical stress, the protein and minerals go out of your system and you just gain fat, in which case veganism is much better.

Lions for example sometimes rape outher lions or eat they new born babies but that does not mean that this is okay for humans to do. And also those animals need meet to survive. But humans don't. In fact it's been proven many times that the optimal amount of animal protein in the human diet is zero. Many studies have also shown that the plant based diet can prevent and even reverse many diseases like cancer, heart disease or diabetes type two. If you interested in that you can check out 'www.nutritionfacts.org' or the documentaries 'Forks Over Knifes' and 'What The Health' on Netflix. 'Mic the Vegan' is also a good YouTube-channel to check out. And what is wrong with eating meat substitutes and other vegan animal product like foods? I didn't stop eating meat because of the taste. I love the way meet tastes! But why not consum products that taste the same or similar but not involve all this violence?

However, veganism also takes away land from ecosystems, like forests and woods in which animals like goats are bred in. It consumes much more land because much more crops are consumed per day than meat (you probably eat around 200% more grain than chicken a day). Not only that, but many vegans consume market oil, which is developed from animal fat; animal fats are also used industrially very commonly. To take away these animal fats would require new replacements to be developed, which is costly and isnt always doable. Veganism has its arguments, and it has its counterarguments. If somebody doesn't want to be vegan or does, it's their choice, and you have no right to enforce what you don't even know is truly beneficial to the world on somebody else.

The meat industry already gives the B12 suppliments to cows and chickens, so you're still indirectly eating them. If you want some natural B12 you can eat some dirt or poop (that's not a joke, that how animals naturally get it). & Milk does have health benefits but it also comes with a lot of problems because humans aren't supposed to drink another animal's milk, especially as adults. You could just eat other sources of those nutrients though, all without the problems that it causes.

So I'll get veggie burgers if they're making burgers, etc. My mom has even been cool enough to make meals without meat for me. So if they're making soup, she'll make it with just the veggie broth, save some for me, and then add chicken at the end for themselves. . It's not the same for everyone but it can be done! Goodluck.

Claiming you support the fight against climate change, and then turning a blind eye to a major cause of greenhouse gas emissions, and environmental destruction is hypocritical. That's also a black and white fallacy. It's unrealistic to expect someone to not breathe. Even if the world switches to green power tomorrow, they will still be tearing down the rainforest to make way for animal feed, overfishing will still be taking place, there will still be copious amounts of cattle sewage running into the ocean and causing dead spots, and methane will still be released from the cattle. I really recommend looking into this at the very least. It doesn't mean you have to become vegan, but if everyone reduced the amount of meat they ate, it would make a huge difference.

As the video states, the amount of grain we feed animals could feed 3.5 billion people instead. Cows need a lot more grain to eat than humans and we may need to eat more grain than a chicken but there's about 50billion chickens on earth so they consume a lot of grain too, along with all other livestock. Considering Patrick baboumian is a power lifting world record holder and vegan, and Kendrick Ferris was the lone American weightlifter who qualified for the 2016 Olympics, setting a U.S record, and vegan. It shows building muscle and strength is at the very least, no more difficult on a vegan diet compared to an omnivorous diet. Veganism may have counterarguments but they are far outweighed and become negligible by the pro arguments	UCzwIpZzNMCr_51aM0jT2cJg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzwIpZzNMCr_51aM0jT2cJg	1	UgyjMJIsMTchb-m7yPN4AaABAg	MJROCKS
UgyjMJIsMTchb-m7yPN4AaABAg.8a47tGpcl108a59M4T7Ew3		1	2017-12-12 22:48:10	Jason Peng	to everybody saying that veganism is better, we get it. veganism does save resources such as water and reduce CO2 emissions. However, veganism also takes away land from ecosystems, like forests and woods in which animals like goats are bred in. It consumes much more land because much more crops are consumed per day than meat (you probably eat around 200% more grain than chicken a day). Not only that, but many vegans consume market oil, which is developed from animal fat; animal fats are also used industrially very commonly. To take away these animal fats would require new replacements to be developed, which is costly and isnt always doable. Veganism has its arguments, and it has its counterarguments. If somebody doesn't want to be vegan or does, it's their choice, and you have no right to enforce what you don't even know is truly beneficial to the world on somebody else. Veganism is also not necessarily healthier. High protein, mineral and Carbohydrate consumption combined with high activity and physical stress builds muscle and develops the immune system much faster and more efficiently than vegetarianism. Many male athletes consume a lot of meat for a reason. That being said, without that high physical stress, the protein and minerals go out of your system and you just gain fat, in which case veganism is much better.

The video only discussed carbon emissions. Don't forget issues like biodiversity, overfishing and threatened rain forests due to growing feed for livestock. You'd combat all of these going vegan to a good extent. So I consider it a pretty great way to fight climate change. Despite that, you can always do more!

This video basically saying meat consumption has an effect on the environment but other sources say that it accounts for at least 75 percent if not more cO2 caused by vehicles. It's basically saying going vegan helps but doesn't really do anything at the same time? it's a video made for people like you, to not go completely vegan but just a small percentage, instead of ripping the bandaid clean of the scab. It's like telling a ciggarette smoker if you only smoke 3 times a week instead of 7 your least likely to get cancer. When doing it in general hurts the person all the same. Like eating meat hurts the enviorment regardless if you eat less. Watch Cowspiracy or forks over knives, its a guy who does real research in how the meat industry and its consumers are hurting the enviorment.

Even the person who reduces their meat intake to the prescribed doctors' recommendation, as mentioned in the video, would reduce their carbon emissions by half; in combination with other practices, such as using mass transit or riding a bike, a person could easily surpass your vegan diet in terms of environmental stewardship! Stop imposing your lifestyle onto others and instead embrace the practical small steps to change people are making.

Yes, let's all trust the Internet vegan and one or two 'lifestyle guru' blog posts, instead of trusting the mass amounts of research done by qualified scientists with one of the best universities in the world, who have spent their lives researching and conducting experiments and models on this topic. Sure, vegan is the least offensive, however he's suggesting it's a small difference between vegan, vegetarian and Mediterranean. He's much more likely to persuade people to change their diet if he's saying you can still eat meat, just in regulation, compared to being all 'yes, vegan is the only way. Must go vegan, no meat or you're evil.' That personally made me much more compelled to look into changing my diet than if he'd just said 'stop eating the thing you've been cultured to have with most meals all of your life.' This was not an Ad for a vegan diet.	UCJ5rQs1sXhx_lHalDafmdIA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ5rQs1sXhx_lHalDafmdIA	1	UgyHDWLjX1XDBZpeOfh4AaABAg	iwasintheshower

Would a diet based mostly on potatoes, fish, beef and chicken be more environmentally friendly or a diet containing mostly fruits and veggies like tomatoes, bananas, avocados, beans and so on?

Considering the cow, drinking water, and the water used to grow the cows food, and loss due to respiration. On paper it just seems so unlikely. I'll happily be proved otherwise.

It takes less water to produce a years worth of food for a person eating a vegan diet than it does to produce a months worth of food for a meat-eater.

He doesn't understand what cryptogamic crust is, or intentionally, grossly misrepresents it in his public speeches. He also thinks he discovered rotational farming for animal production. Which any animal farmer worth there salt does anyway (insert water table joke here) and is still pretty terrible for biodiversity, especially in semi arid and arid zones. Also, no one can replicate his results.	UC5KBg7pnWaAcBio-4EOncEA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5KBg7pnWaAcBio-4EOncEA	1	UgyHDWLjX1XDBZpeOfh4AaABAg	iwasintheshower

Properly ranged beef can actually sequester carbon in the soil and make use of natural forage rather than using grains which require extra water and fertilizer and pesticides and herbicides etc. When we do grow grain, we should eat that ourselves and not feed it to animals due to the enormous carbon footprint that results. But eating animals that have fed on grasses and forbs and ranged from one field to another rather than just standing around in lots denuding the land of all foliage will have a much greater effect on Global Warming than just going vegan will. That part is never really figured into these sorts of calculations.	UCNy4v029AzfhsfIxyOGjwBA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNy4v029AzfhsfIxyOGjwBA	1	UgyHDWLjX1XDBZpeOfh4AaABAg	iwasintheshower

He said that if animal agricultute was done right it could slow down climate change by reverting deserts. Except we dont do it this way. We never will, its not profitable. Eating meat will never be good for the enviornment, because demand decides supply. And Mediterranean diets are all well, but if everyone decided to eat fish instead of red meats, we would overfish the oceans. He said vegetarian diets werent as bad, and that is correct on avarage. However its safe to assume that cheese consumption (which in terms of greenhouses gases is as bad as pigs) would go up.

There seen in Whole foods and TraderJoes. The fact that there are meat substitute shows that normal people aren't prone to eat a meat substitute instead of just meat. We already see that companies don't want to take that risk. Also the bacon and carrot thing was an argument against the idea that meat doesn't have a taste. That's all. Not about meat substitute or if bacon was healthy. Also a patty from McDonald's and a Patty for BurgerWorks taste different. Because they treat there cows differently cause a different taste to happen.

Just because there isn't a guarantee of success doesn't mean the risk isn't worth taking. Sometimes being the first to take an actually good enough product to market is all it takes to become very successful. It's generally easier and cheaper to grow and process plants into various foods than meat. Maybe it will require a lot of R&D, but a good meat substitute that is cheaper than meat is not far from possible. A lot more work than you seem to know of has already been done. You're thinking "What would it be like if some startup started from scratch now" and "what would it be like immediately after they did it" as if that's always how it will be. If they can get fast food restaurants to use the cheaper meat substitute, they could make a lot of money. If it's easy for busy parents to feed their kids with and the kids don't complain about it, there's a market too. Your example with the bacon and the carrot simply doesn't work because it implies that a bacon substitute could only taste like carrot or some other vegetable. Those don't even have the nutrients that are necessary for a meat replacement. Bacon is not something you should eat frequently though, so I do not think it would be worth the effort of replacing. When you eat bacon, you should know you're eating junk food. Pork and steak are the 2 most in need of a good substitute and certainly not as difficult as bacon. Meat does have a taste, but not much of one and it's easy to overpower. Burgers you buy from McDonalds don't really taste that much like beef because they have so much added to them.

Whilst meat is the superior source of protein in terms of grams of protein per 100g it isn't impossible to get the right amount (1g of protein per 1kg of body weight) from plant based foods. You just have to know what to eat and eat more of it.	UCPM3zkIQneMXlFhne8Yz4Qg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPM3zkIQneMXlFhne8Yz4Qg	1	Ugz0ef_wlzowcGuaqjJ4AaABAg	DrizzlingRose

They aren't likely to put so much money into it. It's not something that guaranteed to make profit. They also can't just put a cheap on a product too. The plant based meat substitute with same texture and taste is going to need a great price. And why would the average person buy a meat substitute when they can just go buy meat. It can happen sure but it's not very likely. Also meat does have a taste. The fact that people use seasoning doesn't neglect that. People seasons the mess of vegetables doesn't mean that veggies don't have a taste. A salted piece of bacon and a salted carrot aren't going to taste the same.

As someone that’s tried both diets I certainly prefer to eat a vegetarian diet because 1. I’ve found it much cheaper 2. I feel less tired, get less headaches, and generally have more energy 3. I look forwards to eating more, for less price the food I’m eating now tastes fresher and tastier imo, and I feel good afterwards and no longer bloat after eating lots. Another point is that meat can be quite cheap in the store, but agriculture is expensive to upkeep a lot of taxpayers money goes into it, so a portion of tax we pay goes into the expenses of meat production	UCOMgPqtP5j8HK7ve4CgmaPA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOMgPqtP5j8HK7ve4CgmaPA	1	UgxBPoNbLAqZMFLnDS14AaABAg	Jožo Markovič

You keep telling us your opinion as if it were fact, even when you're completely wrong. For example, vegans can definitely get enough B12, as there are plenty of B12-fortified plant-based milk alternatives or supplements. I mean, you realize that the only reason meat provides enough B12 is because livestock often gets B12 supplements, right? Your argument about the lack of essential amino acids is a fantasy as well, as beans, seeds, nuts, greens, fruits, grains, etc., are all very good sources of all different amino acids. Honestly, you sound like someone who once heard someone say vegans don't get enough B12 or amino acids, and decided they were telling the truth without doing your own research. Like, it's as easy as just googling "vegan B12" or "vegan amino acids" and you'll be met with a ton of information on the subjects.

I don't respect data science, so if you want to point to a bunch of correlation (which does not equal causation), save it. If you have actual studies that point to the actual proven biological processes that show that having no meat in your diet is healthier, feel free. You're going to have a hard time finding that from any reputable source since it's absolute fact we cannot synthesize complete proteins from plant matter, nor can we get B12 from any source other than meat, which you die without.
