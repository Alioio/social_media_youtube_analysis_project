There is no evidence of such feedback loop during the past 10,000 years in which time the earth has warmed and cooled several times. Perhaps you have some contradictory evidence? And what is wrong with publicly available ice core data? This data shows clearly warming and cooling trends prior to the little ice age. You do not get to discard the science when it contradicts your catastrophic views. Or do you believe that only a credentialed acolyte such as yourself can understand and interpret this data for poor ignorant folks like me, eh Dr. Doom? Perhaps you can dispense with the ad hominem in your next reply? It isn't a good look.

For all practical purposes it is an inert gas. You might be confusing it with Carbon Monoxide (CO) which absolutely is toxic. CO is the product of incomplete combustion of carbon. It combines with your blood heamoglobin and effectively stops you absorbing oxygen. That is why people with CO poisening have blue lips. It will readily combine with available oxygen to form inert CO2. In an enclosed space, such as a garage with a car engine running, then it is deadly, and quick. And yes, 35 ppm sounds about right for alarms. (Been a while since we were measuring the stuff) We breathe out CO2 at around 4%. Below 150 ppm and plants start to die. The optimum level of CO2 for plant growth is around 1200 ppm. I'm pretty sure plants didn't spend millions of years evolving to have to deal with at atmosphere a third of optmum. For your information: Oxygen is around 20% and you absolutely need it to live. Noitrogen is around 70% and is completely inert. CO2 keeps plants (and green plankton) alive. The plants give us oxygen. That CO is essential for life. And no, Greta Thunberg cannot smell CO2.	UCm09nNIX4YAQdWX7t9xyrZA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm09nNIX4YAQdWX7t9xyrZA	1	UgxpmRvSp14Vhq6Dg1x4AaABAg	Jeronimo mod

As if every other time the climate changed wasn't natural. But then, people who believe that science can be "settled" have never been too bright. Real scientists know that the climate has varied at least 7 times in geologic history, and humans only existed for 2 of those times. So, to believe that humans affect climate, one has to discount natural climate change 6 times. It also requires one to ignore the fact that carbon increases follow temperature rise, not precedes it.

A larger amount of warming is neutral ( benefits and disruptions negate each other). A very large amount of warming (eg in one billion years when the sun starts to expand) will occasion the loss of earth‚Äôs water into space rendering the planet uninhabitable. Other cataclysms such as nearby supernovas, asteroid impacts and massive volcanism have caused mass extinctions in the past and may occur again.(certainly before the sun expands).

In the late 1200s/early 1300s the period known as the Little Ice Age began and temperature dropped more than it has risen since the Little Ice Age ended in the early/mid 1800s The past 100 years have not seen anything that has not been seen in the past. Most of the warming since the end of the Little Ice Age was lost during the global cooling in the mid 1900s but a solar Grand Maximum occurred and reversed that cooling in the last two decades of the 1900s.

The reason for extremes of cold and hot weather in the temperate north is due to the faster warming of the Acrtic and the decreased energy difference between the arctic and temperate regions slowing the jetstream. That results in more cold weather coming down from the Arctic and more hotter weather moving into the Arctic hence some of the extremes. The general trend is accelerating global average temperature increase. We've just had the hottest September on record, the 2nd lowest sea ice extent in the Arctic and it looks a 2:1 chance we will see the warmest year on record. The fact that Canada has had a cold spell is small part of the year and a small part of the globe, global average temperatures and emissions continue to increase. Such a probablity of 2:1 underscores the fact the covid has had very little effect on increasing temperatures and the scale of the task is enourmous. Amy Coney Barrett can't even admit on record whether she accepts climate change or not as she knows it is a political and existential hot potato. That is in a year of record fires on the west coast and record storms in the gulf states. More fool her as with increasing drought in California that means much of the US food supply in terms of fruit, nuts and veg will see lower yields and increasing crop failures over the coming years.

However global average temperatures were only 0.1 Celsius warmer. We are now at 1.1 to 1.2 Celsius warmer global average temperature rise and some say higher than that depending on the baseline used. That warming is between 1.5 and 2 times as much on continental land masses and between 3 and 4 times global average temperature rises in the Arctic. Given current government policies around the world we have very little chance of staying below 1.5 and will very likely pass through 2.0 Celsius global average temperature rise. That means between 3.0 and 4.0 Celsius temperature rise on continental areas. By 2.0 Celsius global average temperature rise the Arctic multiplier could be at 6, 7 maybe 8 times as much as global average temperature rises and that is assuming a linear rate not a logarithmic rate that takes account of positive feedbacks. That will mean more Greenland, Arctic Ocean and permafrost ice melt plus methane and CO2 emissions from the permafrost and methane clathrates emissions from the Laptev, Kara and the Barents seas. Baseline vents for methane clathrates are around 3,000 vents per 1,000 sq km they are now at around 60,000 per 1,000 sq km in some areas. FYI ice core data goes back around 800,000 years and are one of the most reliable proxy data for past climate including temperature and greenhouse gas concentrations. The very fact that you are citing that the climate has always changed is based on that information so you are in the awkard position of accepting some scientific data on climate and disregarding the severity and rate of the present change in climate.

But seriously, there was a small ice age somewhere in 1600s so you can see on Dutch paintings how people skate on frozen channels and then there was a rapid increase in temperature so for centuries you don't see people skating there anymore. This winter in Russian north was extremly warm but becasue the winter in Canada was extremly cold, breaking the records. So indeed as said in report in Siberia it was warmest winter but that is becasue more Arctic cold went to Canada this time due to winds (and they don't mention that fact and just focus on warm winter in Siberia).

You probably will see more warm winters because the warming is happening and probably will continue. If I'm not misstaken the climate in Europe 1000 years ago was WARMER than now, while 10 000 years ago colder. We do not know how fast were the changes like 10 years ago... We only know the average for some of the period. It can happen that we are now on the warming track but it will go fast for 15 years, then 5 years go colder and then again 15 years of warming etc. So on everage the annual warming during 50 years period will then be "as before" (like 10 000 years ago).

So in a way you are correct but it has not been as fast a change as we are seeing. The only time it has ever been as dramatic is when a natural event such a meteor strike or volcanic eruptions & then its only really been regional change. now however we are seeing global change. Example where i am in NZ we have just had the driest winter on record since the records here were stared its winter & we have had barely a weeks worth of rain for the last four months its still cold but no rain. I have never seen a winter such as this in my lifetime.	UC595SBeURsuH6Wkhr8LVBoQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC595SBeURsuH6Wkhr8LVBoQ	1	UgxdzZfczzn3n6Je70p4AaABAg	Karl Ashdown

Kind of weird Google didn't just redirect you there, isn't it? Just like Google suppresses the story of the century from the Washington post? It's almost like there is information out there they don't want you to know. Like the difference between actual thermometer readings, TOB readings, and final "adjusted" temperature readings. Why do actual thermometer readings show a cooling trend, but "adjusted" temperature readings show a warming trend? Why do "climate scientists" change the temperature in the past to show it cooler, and current temperatures to be warmer? Is altering past and current temperatures to fit their theories "science," or is it farcical? Why isn't the arctic ice free? "Climate scientists" said it would be by 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2018, have you check NOAA's sea ice extent map? Why has no coastal area been overwhelmed by rising sea levels like "climate scientists" have predicted multiple times? Why are deserts shrinking all over the world if the temperatures are rising? Why is sea ice expanding in Antarctica? Just some questions you should look into. People who ask no questions, get no answers, if no answers are found people become ignorant. If "climate scientists" social media and the mainstream media try to hide the answers, and the sources, what does that mean? Learn to research things, Google and Wikipedia are not good sources. Ask the Danish scientists who were told the icesheet they were living on was melting, and when they responded with the real temperature reading, that was well below freezing, the media, social media, (on which they had responded directly) and "climate scientists" ignored them. Kinda weird isn't it? That all those people who claim to be experts on climate change don't want to hear actual data, from actual scientist, who were actually on the ice sheet in question? The only question I have left is, were you taught how to think, or were you what to think?
