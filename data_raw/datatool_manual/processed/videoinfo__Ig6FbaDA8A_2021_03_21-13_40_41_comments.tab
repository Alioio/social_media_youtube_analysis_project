The amount of increase since 1960 according to NASA. This will not make any difference. <br /> <br />Want to control the climate? First, you need to find a way to regulate the nuclear fusion process in the sun. Second, you need to keep the earth‚Äôs magnetosphere at a constant level. Third, stop the earth from its ongoing increase in axial tilt which is causing the arctic circle to march northwards at almost 50 feet every year (remember, the earth‚Äôs oceans have 1,000,000 times more heat capacity than the atmosphere). Do these, and then you have a shot. Do them not, and nothing else matters. <br /> <br />Better to worry about NEOs, near earth objects. The next biggy will be close to earth in 2029. NASA has changed its mind about the probability of this striking earth from likely to now unlikely but that can change. NEOs will cause an extinction level event far sooner than the climate changing significantly, which will be about 100,000 years.

Co2 is at 410 plus PPM and it&#39;s not George H.W. Bush that just got elected.	UC8cx8hkv4zi3g4D6X4nxpIw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8cx8hkv4zi3g4D6X4nxpIw	0

Most of it is because of natural causes yes we accelerated a little but it is going to happen no matter what you do. Just look at the past; the earth in the past was 40 degrees which right now it is 13. What I am trying to say is devolution is not the way we combat this. The industrial revolution would have never happened if we were worried like we are right now. And look at all the good that the industrial revolution had done for us as a species. Without that we would have never gone to space or be able to travel anywhere anytime. We wouldn‚Äôt have the smartphones, computers, televisions, and the other devices you are using right now, seeing this comment on. Just think about the world around today and how great it can be.

We do not accept this ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù! We, the people, KNOW that everything occurring right now is evil, corrupt &amp; fraudulent! Regardless of who you wanted to become president, anyone with a brain can see that Biden is not pulling his own strings, he‚Äôs a puppet of this evil machine that is destroying our country at a terrifying rate. Why on earth would Biden suspend an executive order that trump put in place to protect our power grid from foreign interference!??? There is literally not even a valid excuse for him to suspend it? You would think they‚Äôd atleast try to come up with some BS that sounds like it makes sense (to the brainwashed), but no, they don‚Äôt even care at this point. They‚Äôre moving at rapid speed now. I pray that my children may grow up in a free country like I did, not one in which speech is criminalized, ideas are silenced &amp; ‚Äútruth‚Äù is manufactured. Evil will not win in the end. People need to never stop fighting back while also trying to keep our energy high (do not give in to fear). This is not simply a war on our country/freedoms but also a war on our minds. Don‚Äôt let them trick you into fear. Connect, love, support, hug, share ideas, spend time in nature, hydrate, meditate, unplug, learn, grow, READ, question EVERYTHING and continue standing up for what‚Äôs right.

And as the Earth warmed it has allowed the human race to multiply and expand. Now some see that as a good thing, others are sure that we are damaging it beyond our ability to live on it. <br /><br />I suggest we put all this climate control money into getting as much manufacturing as we can into space. Are there problems with this plan, yes there are. Will there be difficulties with getting started in space, yes there will be. But we had a President who challenged us to do what was hard and go to the Moon. And we did it with technology that is less sophisticated than your cell phone. We are reaping the benefits of that challenge and the efforts to overcome it to this day, that cell phone and the laptop I&#39;m using are just the start of that list. The research that went into making space craft batteries more efficient and longer lasting has resulted in the improving systems used in electric cars and solar systems for homes.<br /><br />This is how we will save our world, by getting off of it and learning how to live in harsh environments where we must recycle waste material and produce clean energy easily and cheaply. We can not continue to use up resources without a plan on how to reutilize those materials in a safe manner or find new and better sources. Space will provide us with those new resources and going there will have to teach us how to make ever ounce of material that we put up stretch as much and as long as we can. Those same lessons can be used on Earth to make us more environmentally friendly.	UCZqQXM7_QEEeIqg5-BF9rQw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZqQXM7_QEEeIqg5-BF9rQw	0

Because under Marxist Socialism you only have two classes of people, the Ruling Elite of the government and the underclass that is enslaved to and dependent on government, the underclass sole existence is to serve the State and the political party in charge. Biden Executive orders on Day 1: Revoked Keystone XL Pipeline Permit, Seized all construction and maintenance: 152,876 Middle Class Jobs destroyed and forced onto unemployment then welfare roles. Revoked Atlantic Coast Pipeline Permit, Seized all construction and maintenance: 86,789 middle class jobs destroyed and Individuals forced onto unemployment then the welfare roles. Banned Fracking on Federal Lands; 13 million middle class jobs destroyed and individuals forced onto unemployment then welfare. These are just direct jobs in the industry they do not include the number of millions of individuals who work in the manufacturing and supply side supporting the energy industry who will loose their jobs due to the Marxist Biden Regimes war on energy, you will now see $5 plus a gallon of gasoline, who benefits from this? The Democrat Party (just created millions of unemployed government dependent voters) China, Iran, North Korea, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, etc,c the US just became dependent on and controlled by foreign countries for our energy requirements which is the sole driver of America‚Äôs economy.

Biden was elected because Trump was not doing on dealing with the Pandimic! Thats the main thing right now he needs to stay on top of! He is trying to drive up the price of gas/oil to get the country to move to green! Also Trump had some good policy&#39;s that Biden wants to roll back just to be political! Things that make common sense to do should not be made political! Both partys need to work together as much as possible! If they don&#39;t, this country will fall! Neither party really worries about us the people, they are just worry about lobbyist, and their party instead of Americans who pay their salary! I voted for Biden because of the Coronavirus, and im sure thats why most other independents voted Biden! We should have affordable oil until we get the infrastructure in place to transition to green energy!	UC8k7xrGVJs3JLigWDFXtTng	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8k7xrGVJs3JLigWDFXtTng	0

The fact that salaried employees still even work over 40 without proper compensation should be against the law imo. You realize that if minimum wage hadnt stagnated and dropped off since the 70s it would be over 20 dollars an hour adjusting right? Thank you reagan and neocons for destroying labor unions and implementing trickle down economics to ruin the country.

UgyyfbenhXmZf9o-HJN4AaABAg	0	0	2021-01-28 07:35:06	Brandon s	All you have such ridiculous cases of TDS all you can still talk about is Trump! That&#39;s all you can talk about! That&#39;s all they can talk about! They don&#39;t get a thing done for the people! Just like they haven&#39;t done anything for the people in the past 4 years except for $crew them over! The entire time they&#39;re doing nothing except for hurting the country and destroying it as much as they possibly can on purpose while they scream about the only person that was actually doing anything to better things! If you can truthfully say that Biden is doing a good job and hasn&#39;t done more damage to the country in less than a week then Trump has done in his entire term then you are just lying to yourself! Either that or you&#39;re so indoctrinated and so programmed that you can&#39;t even think anymore and all you can do is go to the left and their propaganda machine that take all the MSM every day to see what you&#39;re supposed to think and feel! Wake up they&#39;re destroying the country and you&#39;re cheering for it! You&#39;re so upset because you didn&#39;t like how a guy talked! So you&#39;d rather get rid of the guy that talked to mean and made you have feelings then the guy that is under investigation along with his entire family for selling everyone out to foreign governments and lining his pockets! Using his name and position in order to do it! You&#39;re really that Patty that you&#39;re going to buy into all of their BS and cheer for them to destroy the country rather than teaming up with the other half of the country that you have just about everything in common with in order to get things accomplished and save the country if it&#39;s even possible at this point! All You&#39;re doing is exactly what they want you to do and have told you to do! They divide us, turn each other against one another and are actually able to convince half the country that the other half thinks about nothing but race and are a bunch of racists That are trying to destroy the country! When in reality they&#39;re dividing and conquering! They&#39;re playing you and you&#39;re loving it! All because they told you to hate one man and then pound it into your head so hard every second of the day for so long they were able to convince you that half of the country are a bunch of Nazis! You know the same people that are your neighbors and that are your neighbors and that that are your neighbors and that you&#39;ve that are your neighbors and that that are your neighbors, family, coworkers, Etc! they&#39;ve been able to get you so twisted to believe that all of the sudden the people that you I&#39;ve gotten along with and lived with your entire life are now totally different and you should hate them no matter what! It&#39;s mind-boggling and boils my blood to think that this many people in our country are Solo information and ignorant that all they want to do is hate and are so easily swayed can&#39;t believe whatever they&#39;re told to! come on you cheered for BLM and antifa When they laid seizure on the White House! the problem is you also cheered when they destroyed small businesses and hurt people as well as killed people! Your real enemy is the government and you should know that especially with how they are treating you and how they trade-up played you in order to vote for Biden and right after he gets in they tell you that they played you! Nope I&#39;m not doing anything for you! I&#39;ve got a great plan for covid! oh wait a second we&#39;re going to also tell you that we were left with no way to give vaccines that&#39;s why we aren&#39;t able to do it! even though if you paid attention and didn&#39;t listen to the MSM you would know that Trump had it to the point of where he was giving out a million vaccines a day every day! Now they&#39;re saying there was nothing there and they&#39;re going to make it so there is a million vaccines a day and then they&#39;re going to Pat themselves on the back and say what an accomplishment! Meanwhile by then finally came out and told you about his great plan for sorry there&#39;s nothing I can do about it it&#39;s going to get worse before it gets better nothing we can do! you called Trump a dictator yet he wasn&#39;t the one that put 25,000 troops in the capital and other troops around the entire country as well as move troops into Syria and other countries already! Trump wasn&#39;t the one that censored everyone kick them off of social media, got rid of hundreds of thousands of jobs within his first three days and a lawsuit from Canada! while he sits there and signs executive order after executive order everyday even though they have control of pretty much all of the government because of how they rig the system and threw the Constitution out the window! so you called Trump a dictator yet he wouldn&#39;t do any of those things or anyting that a dictator would do except for you calling him one!! meanwhile Biden sits there and dictates what he wants you to do and forces everyone to do it through executive action Even though he doesn&#39;t even know what he&#39;s signing half the time! So who&#39;s the dictator who&#39;s the ones that are destroying the country? How can you sit there and be so ignorant so what&#39;s happening it is absolutely mind-boggling and infuriating people have such little knowledge and Common Sense! I guarantee I&#39;m going to get a bunch of you saying what&#39;s wrong with you you&#39;re on a drug-fueled binge Blabbering! Or some other BS but I guarantee that you won&#39;t put up a counter argument and have any type of valid points to make except for orange man bad and you guys are so dumb and we are so smart that&#39;s why we put in a career crony politician in order to take down the government and make things better! Once again sound Reasoning there! and yeah there is something wrong with a lot of us... What&#39;s wrong is we are sick and tired of watching our country be destroyed and half of the country cheer for it and have no idea what they&#39;re even talkin about or what&#39;s going on 90% of the time! you should be incredibly upset as well! And I don&#39;t mean at your countrymen I mean the real reason you should be upset... The politicians, the tech Giant&#39;s, big Pharma and the other Elites that are playing us all and reaping the benefits while we lose our country for good and most likely will never get it back if history is any indication superpowers never come back to anywhere near their former glory once they are ripped apart and destroyed like this so when you&#39;re looking yourself in the mirror think about the country that is allowed you to be so entitled and think about how you are directly responsible embracing and empowering these people to destroy the country and not only for yourself but everyone else that was smart enough not to go along and not to vote for these people and fight against them with all of their might doing everything they can to try to rescue what they love about their country, the people in it and what was their way of life the same life Millions fight and die in order to try to get to every year! The same lifestyle and values that you all say are racist and horrible and not worth having or fighting for but instead should be destroyed even though this country is the only way you can be so entitled and ignorant in order to act that way to begin with while you fight and push to have not only your rights taken but everyone else is that Treasures them and knows how important and rare they really are	UCUOVNkpttj5Ml59QkrkzYWQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUOVNkpttj5Ml59QkrkzYWQ	0

That oil is still going to come in from Canada. The only difference is that now it&#39;s going to be trucked or railed in, instead of the more economically and environmentally efficient pipeline... Do you have any idea how much more the expenditure of fossil fuels are going to have to be used in order to bring that oil in without the pipeline? Not only has Biden killed thousands of jobs in his first week in office, but this measure is completely counterproductive to the agenda that it claims to support. Man, it&#39;s beyond astounding how you people are so unbelievably clueless...	UCmNq7Wfy78HVIUIFNPPU2ZA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmNq7Wfy78HVIUIFNPPU2ZA	0

Based on historic solar cycles, solar activity will dwindle in 2020 to the lowest level in over 200 years. The low in the sun‚Äôs 11-year cycle is likely to cause odd weather patterns and may cause severe cooling, especially in Europe and North America. Based on 20 years of observation and data, scientists are predicting that the sun will be nearly seven percent cooler and dimmer by 2050 causing a ‚Äòmini ice age‚Äô.

I&#39;m not buying into this crap any longer, haven&#39;t for years. I believe you MSM have been the problem all a long, when are you going to start telling people the truth about your nefarious connections to these evil and vial people you protect, it has never been more evident than it is now, that President Trump was completely on point about you people and calling you fake news, you&#39;re fake agenda to try to make the American people believe that Biden has become our President. We were told on inauguration day that it was a live feed, when it was discovered there was a loop in the live feed, therefore it was fake and pre-recorded. Also, I want the American people to know that President Trump dismantled the corporation of the United States last year in July, that&#39;s why you, the crooked politicians on both sides, almost 90% wanted Trump gone at any cost. He was threatening your way of life. Trump will be back people, he isn&#39;t done yet and these people are trying to hide it for as long as they can, get ready for Nesara/Gesara and the downfall of the Central Bank, fake MSM, Twitter, Facebook, Google, YouTube and all the other social media platforms that have been censoring us, that&#39;s allüá∫üá≤ Trump 2021 üí£üçøü§©üôèüòÅ	UCrtaE1jfKY23wsSO2YR1eGg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrtaE1jfKY23wsSO2YR1eGg	0

The pipeline leaked over 210,000 gallons of oil 3 yyears ago. Lol it&#39;s like do you mean the jobs that were nogiated to be unionized AFTER the deal was turned down? After the pipeline is built it would require a PERMANENT 35 jobs to operate. 35 jobs guys. It&#39;s nothing you get way more jobs building new energy infrastructure with nuclear, and green renewable energy. Renewable energy is also set to phase out coal by 2024.

Because under Marxist Socialism you only have two classes of people, the Ruling Elite of the government and the underclass that is enslaved to and dependent on government, the underclass sole existence is to serve the State and the political party in charge. Biden Executive orders on Day 1: Revoked Keystone XL Pipeline Permit, Seized all construction and maintenance: 152,876 Middle Class Jobs destroyed and forced onto unemployment then welfare roles. Revoked Atlantic Coast Pipeline Permit, Seized all construction and maintenance: 86,789 middle class jobs destroyed and Individuals forced onto unemployment then the welfare roles. Banned Fracking on Federal Lands; 13 million middle class jobs destroyed and individuals forced onto unemployment then welfare. These are just direct jobs in the industry they do not include the number of millions of individuals who work in the manufacturing and supply side supporting the energy industry who will loose their jobs due to the Marxist Biden Regimes war on energy, you will now see $5 plus a gallon of gasoline, who benefits from this? The Democrat Party (just created millions of unemployed government dependent voters) China, Iran, North Korea, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, etc, the US just became dependent on and controlled by foreign countries for our energy requirements which is the sole driver of America‚Äôs economy. PDJT put Americans back to WORK and decreased the welfare role by 17 million people whereas the Obama-Biden Regime destroyed the energy, healthcare, steel, manufacturing industries and increased the welfare role from 13 million to 58 million by the end of their 8 year totalitarian marxist reign!

To be clear, that is a pipeline that is meant to carry Canadian oil to the gulf to be sold elsewhere. The 11,000 jobs estimated by the Canadian company are temporary jobs with no indication if they would actually be American jobs. The state department (pre Biden) estimated that it would need 50 jobs to maintain (15 of which would be temporary) and again no indication if they would be American jobs.

Yeah, sure, the Dems believe in science, except they don&#39;t, and just use that as a platitude to separate themselves from those &quot;bad Republicans&quot; when it&#39;s obvious they&#39;re one in the same.

I bet most of our leadership and media has bought stocks in the German company that makes the wind mills and the truth is they aren&#39;t that great at making power for a small town of thousand people you would need more wind mills then people!!

If you're talking about the Keystone XL pipeline you would know that it is Canadian oil being pumped through the US to get to the Gulf to be sold elsewhere. The canadian company itself only estimated 11,000 jobs all of which were temporary and no guarantees it would even be American labor. The State department (before Biden) said it would need 50 jobs to maintain the pipeline after completion... Five-zero. 15 of which would be temporary and again no indication if those fifty would be American jobs.

Dear Leader Biden will close all coal-fired plants here and restrict the use of fossil fuels at the same time. Result? Higher costs for energy for businesses to produce their products and higher home energy bills and rolling blackouts like parts of California experienced last year. Great to be back to the good old ways of America last as Dear Leader Biden promised.

What is all this energy use even going towards? It's all being wasted on completely unnecessary activity. Most of the gasoline is going towards unnecessary travel. Think of how much plastic is being wasted on products that are not only planned to go obsolete, but unnecessary in the first place.

If the market wants green energy, then it will come around as a free market asks. For example, tesla made an electric car that is one of the safest, fastest, least maintinence, and fairly priced compared to ice vehicles- with a charging network to boot. Once the greener option is naturally more convenient in every way, people adopt it. For instance, once you can get a basic smartphone for 60 dollars, it is impractical not to have a smartphone for the cost/ benefit ratio. With this artificial energy push, Biden will tell you what jobs to have and what cars to drive based on emissions, but . Politicians that have never worked a private sector job in their life just think pipe fitters and welders are going to be laid off on a wednesday and be building solar panels on a thursday. Government is so inefficient already, and has never had a good reputation of creating jobs. Reminds me of all the serfs in Mao&#39;s Great Leap Backwards that were turned into steel makers overnight at the snap of a government finger. We know how these artificial efforts to demand work turn out. I dont know anybody who doesnt want the oceans less acidic, or the ocean garbage patches gone, but forcing green initiatives will just cause excessive spending for initiatives that do not get adopted or welcomed because of all the overnight losses, restrictions, and red tape. Maybe Corn Pop will come back around and give this guy a talk üëä	UCGvKF3-jqh8Qjjb1Uut86Tw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGvKF3-jqh8Qjjb1Uut86Tw	0

Is that not supporting minorities? Dude your evidence is a freaking Ad or something versus the actual laws Biden has been behind that visibly hurt the minorities you claim to defend. But in a sense you are right, he (Trump) doesn't support minorities. He supports American people, by providing a functioning economy and lifting untenable tax restrictions. You see, that kind of thing does not observe race or religion; that is the kind of thing that everyone benefits from. Did you know that the tax code actually PENALIZED you for self-employment under Obama? That's right, you were PENALIZED for being successfully self-employed and taxed an extra percentage... a self-employment tax. Why? Because being self-employed makes it difficult for the corporate-political elite to suck your blood. Yeah. Really supporting the American citizen dawg. Please Biden use the tax code to criminalize my entrepreneurship and economic success like your predecessor Obama! YEAH I'M PUMPED. I get that you're probably either too young or too dumb to care about any of this kind of stuff, and you either feed off your parents still or you just flip burgers or something and don't have any reason to worry about weird tax crap like this, but you know what? Why are you on here trying to have a political discussion then. Go do something productive with your time. Because trying to respond to me is going to be the opposite of productive for you: you have nothing to say to me that I haven't heard 1000 other people say in exactly the same way 1,000 other times. Because you don't have thoughts. You have reflexes. Limbic-system functions that for some reason you feel the need to sit here and translate into words, much to the chagrin of everyone who reads them. Whereas, with what I have to say: I know you've never heard any of this before. So it throws you off having to confront an original thought and you don't really know what to say, because the only way to respond to an original thought is with an original thought of your own, and it seems like you're yet another person who has constructed their whole life around avoiding ever having to think on your own, for yourself. Just like the first dude I responded to in here, hasn't spoken up again since, and he's not going to. Get bent.

They lack the energy density, the compatibility with our current energy infrastructure, and reliability to meet our current or projected energy needs. Like it or not, we are dependent on fossil fuels for the foreseeable future and intentionally damaging the oil and gas industry until we have truly viable replacements ( most likely 4th generation nuclear in additional to wind and solar plus viable energy storage) can have terrible consequences. Instead of treating the oil and gas industry as the enemy and trying to destroy it, we need to do everything possible to make it efficient and clean as possible as we make the transition to cleaner sources. I have heard nothing in Biden&#39;s plan regarding nuclear energy or a realistic plan on how we make the transition to an infrastructure that can deal with the unreliable energy sources like wind and solar. All I have heard is a bunch of political jargon to make the WOKE feel good about themselves.	UCgJEC2yomRBJ9wt0GfXqYmw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgJEC2yomRBJ9wt0GfXqYmw	0

They contracted with six companies to hire the union workers for 4 to 8 month jobs. Not all those jobs are going to be working at the same time. Majority of the jobs have not even been hired yet. I believe phase 1 took about two years and it was 2100 miles. Phase 4 was 1700. The concept that the length of time to complete a project correlates to full-time employment for each individual Union employee is inaccurate.

Grain prices shot up through the roof, people couldn't afford to eat and eventually the King lost his head. A few years later when the period known as the little ice age ended, the temperatures gradually rose again and became warmer than usual for a few years.

Helping people is way more expensive than wars or bailouts. The U.S. has 140 Trillion in Socialist obligations and spends a trillion a year on welfare in America alone. The only solution is for people to help themselves as there are way too many people that need help. 60 million on welfare in the U.S. and billions that are starving around the world. 50,000 people die each day from starvation so the situation is not as simple to fix as you think. The U.S. is bankrupt, yet Biden and the Democrats are living in a fantasy land of delusion.

Many scientists have made predictions which based on this law and calculations, the solar system will disappear eventually. The only thing we could slow down (cannot stop it) the climate change is COMPLETELY to prohibit using all energy sources which produce CO or CO2 and find a way to stop our bodies to release CO2. If not, this could be &#39;A Chicken Little Syndrome&quot; in politics.	UC9UlQQrmuXh5uxU_9iLMJhQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9UlQQrmuXh5uxU_9iLMJhQ	0

Also do they realize that if the USA stopped all emmitions, that it would only decrease the global temperature by 2 tenths (0.2) degrees? In addition., the USA only contributes 12% of global emmitions? <br /><br />I&#39;m not sure how giving China $25,000,000 USA dollars to think about maybe doing something about climate change will do anything. I&#39;m not sure how giving India $25,000,000 USA dollars to think about climate change, or any of the other countries that the USA (i.e. the American people) will give money to to think about climate change, will really do anything to climate change. <br /><br />So far, all I&#39;ve seen is that in the name of climate change, is that USA citizens have lost their jobs. And at some point besides increasing my taxes, all I see is that gasoline prices going up. In addition, since most of us can&#39;t afford new cars, were will that leave us? <br /><br />There are all sorts of scrubbers that would reduce emmitions from power plants. There are scrubbers that will take CO out of the atmosphere, thus helping reduce climate change. <br /><br />I know &quot;The Green New Deal&quot; was a book, written by a man who is not a scientist or an economics expert. And from what I&#39;ve seen of all of his previous works, they are nice in theory, but don&#39;t work in the real world. Please go look for yourself. And please read &quot;The Gren New Deal&quot; as proposed by our own goverment.	UCi3E7FyNET6HJFIUyAikR7A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi3E7FyNET6HJFIUyAikR7A	0

Also, China is making massive efforts to curb their pollution, and America is falling behind. On the economic side, if America begins manufacturing renewable energy equipment sooner rather than later, then we can be at the forefront of the renewable energy revolution and beat China. It will revolutionize and revitalize the American economy for potentially generations. At the end of the day, I think I'm preaching to the choir here- You clearly agree with me that climate change is a massive problem, and we just disagree on exactly what to do to stop it. I can see your side, and as long as you can see mine, I'm glad that we are able to have a respectful discussion üòä	UCu5ddl05rmYs8OqokJRI1hw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu5ddl05rmYs8OqokJRI1hw	1	UgyIvTY1jre0VFqI3G94AaABAg	Randy Newman

Unfortunately, at the rate we are going, we only have 11 years to drastically reduce our carbon emissions before the Earth enters into an unstoppable feedback loop. Therefore, we can no longer wait for science denying Republicans to catch up. If we continue to make small steps forward, there won't be a planet to leave to our children.

To scare you into thinking your children will suffer. They KNOW you will defend this action because they KNOW you will think about your kids. They're using you & your kids to profit. Its obvious if you actually read it. You would probably understand instead of trying to get others to agree with you when you have no idea what you are agreeing with yourself. Soccer moms are the worst. They are easily manipulated into pushing for more restrictions and less rights. Its disgusting!

When they don't have someone in office that is raging war constantly & creating major profit for the elite, the media spouts nothing but chaos to change your state of mind, so you will think they are the heros. Obama killed 60% innocents with his drone bombings, started 7 illegal wars, put thousands of kids in cages & then later LOST THEM, & countless other things that I'd have to write a book to explain it all. The very first day Biden came into office, he signed his first executive order, then as he was going to sign his second exec. order, he turns to Kamala and says, I dont know what I am signing. She relies, just sign them. Hes a complete puppet that will sign anything put in front of him, & if he doesn't know what he is signing, than there is obviously someone else pulling the strings. He can't hold a full conversation without forgetting the date, & to you he is a "step up from any president". " I like kids jumping in my lap" - your president.

Democrats are extreme, radical Stepford wives trying to destroy America, American exceptionalism, capitalism, the U.S. Constitution and the middle class? Some of you might say, , you&#39;re exaggerating.&quot;<br />Nope. I&#39;m not.<br />I&#39;m going to play the role of Paul Revere. I&#39;m going to expose a bill in Congress championed by congressional Democrats called H.R. 5383: the New Way Forward Act, introduced in December. It&#39;s so extreme, radical, hateful and offensive toward American citizens that its only possible goal is the end of America.<br /><br />I believe it represents evil. But I&#39;ll report. You decide.<br /><br />The New Way Forward Act -- which supporters say is intended to &quot;advance racial justice for immigration communities&quot; -- says anyone and everyone in the world can come to America -- no laws, no papers, no background check required. It eliminates illegal immigration.<br /><br />And it makes it virtually impossible for anyone to ever again be deported, for any reason. Being here illegally will never again result in deportation. Neither will committing serious crimes. This bill brags about ending the &quot;prison to deportation pipeline.&quot;<br /><br />No criminal can be deported for drug offenses, fraud or felonies. Not for depraved acts of moral turpitude, such as sexual assault, child abuse and sex crimes against children. Any crime that carries a sentence of less than five years will no longer result in deportation. In many cases, this includes manslaughter	UCCfagiHVb4vb-OrLGsdqrkA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCfagiHVb4vb-OrLGsdqrkA	0

Nothing against Ivanka personally, it's just not worth trusting someone who isn't informed on the labor sector. I support Kamala because she understands student debt is an issue in our country, she discussed it in the debate. She supports forgiving at least 10k in student loans per student. Take a look at the average debt a student accumulates. I have been paying for a lil over a decade and I still can't get to half of what my original amount was when I graduated. I have been making double payments for almost 3 years but the balance is almost the same. I don't consider Biden/Kamala the best shot but I can't support politicians who can't offer some type of relief to people who are truly hurting economically at the moment. It's unrealistic to think that $7.25 an hour (which is the minimum here in Texas) is a fair pay for low income families. Rural families are hurting as well. Kids don't even have shoes for crying out loud. They live in trailers in the country. People get sick but can't go to the doctor cause they don't have insurance. It's absolutely ridiculous!

That is the case with our current President. He is an unfit President. Trump knew what he was doing and took challenges head on and still does. We flourished as a nation due to his hard work and dedication to the country. Sure, Barack can speak very well, but he was an awful president. Examples:¬† 1. More war than any president in history 2. He allowed ISIS to flourish and armed and aided them 3. He put troops on the ground in Syria after saying numerous times he wouldn't 4. Under Obamacare, Americans were paying more money for less health coverage 5. DACA through executive order. He allowed illegal immigrants to flood into our country. Obama went around congress to give amnesty to roughly 800,00 illegal immigrants. 6. Obamagate. The Obama administration's intelligence community normalized domestic spying. Ex: Obama officials were caught monitoring the convos of members of congress who opposed the Iran nuclear deal. Trump recently declassified the Obamagate files. You can speak with eloquence and maintain a good appearance, but it is your behavior and your actions that will reveal your true character.

Food stamps, medical coverage, and job training grants are available too if you&#39;re willing to sign up, and at no cost. If you&#39;re desperate for money, drive for Lyft, Uber, Amazon, etc., everyone could drive right? Plus, it&#39;s on your terms as an independent contractor. The truth is, people are too lazy to educate themselves for another skill and refuse to settle for a job that pays less than what they were earning before. With the executive order in place, no landlords or foreclosure proceedings can force you out of your apartment or house yet. Put in the effort if you want to live comfortably, there are &#39;Covid Relief Fund Scholarship&#39; for low-income students and other grants for adult learning programs. When the gov says they want to protect USA trademarks and promote clean energy, get your certifications now so you can have good-paying jobs once it starts. Learn to move forward with the new Era. Economists, Investors, and Stock Traders are on board with the plan, so why the hesitation?	UCVcqgf3WYDrIhW2uYZVYQFg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVcqgf3WYDrIhW2uYZVYQFg	0

The operation is in full-swing, behind the scenes. The list is being checked off, but the plan will shift according to circumstances on the ground. Meanwhile, stay out of the way. The military, DHS, and FEMA are in command.<br /><br />This was never about a four-year election, or Trump, or even the United States. It was for freeing this planet and its people from slavery under an negatively-polarized ALIEN power. Believe it or not. Your choice.

Even bible timelines say world changing event coming in April. <br /><br />Fwd: ‚ÄúThis is HUGE. HUGE. OMG<br /><br />TOLD U<br />Q Is QUANTUM DARK TO LIGHT BLESSED NEWS &amp; PATRIOTS WIN IN THE END...Durham Report is out...Everything declassified...military saw evidence voter fraud foreign and domestic. Vatican paid for Lombardo satellite that accessed Dominion servers to hack the election and change the votes...Vatican raided, ARRESTS made, and laundered money &amp; gold made from all deep state drugs, human trafficking and pedophilia CONFISCATED.<br /><br />Video taped confessions will be shown to the public, Military Tribunal trials, and sentences for treason. Since 1871, USA Incorporated has been stealing from citizens and illegally formed IRS collecting taxes which is against the Constitution.<br /><br />Before leaving TRUMP enacted Nesara which was passed in 1999 but kept from us by BUSH, CLINTON &amp; OBAMA admns which will forgive a lot of Citizen debt, and our national debt is paid by recovered deep state cabal assets.<br /><br />In comments, I will show all that will play out. President Trump will run in new elections monitored by military using Quantum blockchain voting system with voter ID that cannot be corrupted. Proven that Trump won 80% of the vote the first time winning all states except one including California.<br /><br />He will return in Spring as our 19th president of our Republic going back to our original Constitution and power to the people. Since 1871 &amp; 18TH president Ulysses Grant, all presidents were elected under USA Incorporated which is now bankrupt and dissolved &amp; did not follow constitution.<br /><br />The Deep State also kept thousands of patents hidden from us with Aerospace and medical technology that will bankrupt big Pharma, hurt auto industry, oil industry &amp; Military industry. We have been taking unnecessary drugs &amp; vaccines for diseases, they already have cures for including cancer.<br /><br />They also have free energy th<br />at was never revealed to keep the big oil industry going. The whole world will live in a financially secure world and eliminate poverty. We came very close to the globalist keeping these secrets from us and enslaving us with tyrannical One World Government and their plans to depopulate the Earth for only the ELITE Chosen FEW.<br /><br />Thank God for his divine intervention using President Trump to carry out his plan! More details to come and many people to be woken up in the coming months. You have been watching a movie that isn&#39;t reality, and Biden is not in control!!<br /><br />The military controls is now in control of our new Republic. That is why they did not send a military plane to pick up Biden for his inauguration and that is why the Department of Defense will not follow any of his orders. <br /><br />Biden also does not have the nuclear code. Biden sold us out to China and we are now at war with China so he is the enemy. We are at War with China that infiltrated all six corporations that control our media, and bribed politicians, judges, our courts up to the Supreme Court, CIA, FBI, DOJ, state legislators, BIG TECH, SOCIAL MEDIA, and our lower &amp; higher education.<br /><br />An alliance in our military saw this evil corruption since the CIA assassinated JFK under direction of George Bush who was the CIA DIRECTOR. George Bush SR as president ran drugs from Afghanistan and Mexico, and also a human trafficking and pedophilia operation.<br /><br />Military alliance have been working on a plan to take our Republic back since then but they needed the executive office that could not be corrupted or bribed and they chose Trump. Trump was very close friends with JFK Junior in New York and when he saw the Twin Towers go down and then the Third World Trade Center building implode he knew it was an inside job.<br /><br />NESARA WAS SUPPOSE TO BE ANNOUNCED 9/11 TO AMERICA, BUT THE FALSE FLAG EVENT DISTRACTED FROM THAT.<br /><br />All the documentation for nesara was in World Trade Center building 7 that was imploded along with the tower<br />s and they strategically struck the part of the Pentagon that had all the records on Nesara. It is believed that BUSH JR, our president at the time was behind it along with his father.<br /><br />Nesara would have revealed the Deep State and taken all of their Fortune.‚Äù	UCICDnvMJfJbFR3gms_X-RsA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCICDnvMJfJbFR3gms_X-RsA	0

This will create hundreds of thousands of jobs. We will need charging stations and/or battery swap shops that still need to be built. Electricians we be in demand to add 220 charging outlets at homes across the country. That&#39;s just for auto. Solar and wind jobs are already growing and expected to continue to grow. We just got to get out of this pandemic.	UCiYAMDNRT1ZKZKeAYfjBXEg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiYAMDNRT1ZKZKeAYfjBXEg	0

That might be okay if we aren't still paying the taxes but the last I checked the executive order didn't end taxes on citizens at the pump. That kinda means we're paying double for the same product since we're paying out of pocket and paying a $0.31/gallon federal tax. Where do those tax dollars go now btw? You'd be correct in calling it socialism. Society works and elitist get the prize. Watch, gas will go up $2+/gallon within a year and in 2-3 years the government will say "we need more taxes to further combat fossil fuels". Which of course won't actually be combated against nor will it further advance any green energy sector. Good luck with that though.

I mean they‚Äôre still going to have to get oil and gas from somewhere. I‚Äôve not even heard of any major environmental problems relating to the pipeline, but either way, why not at least try to invest in improving it before destroying thousands of jobs in the midst of a pandemic? Also, he has no substitute at the ready to provide these workers with jobs, or for us to remain energy-independent. Now gas prices will go up, and Middle Eastern countries will have potential political leverage on America because we‚Äôre reliant on them.

It's literally a stock market revolution and honestly its a fight against the bloated hedgefund machine that Rumpt makes wads of cash from. Buying stock in Gamestop is literally tearing at the bloated wealth of filth pigs like Rumpt. So, that was a very bad example for you to use. Nice try buddy, but it was a fail.

He probably has some of the people from the NIST who did the 9/11 report on his team. For reference, the team of scientists at the NIST determined that building 7 which was not hit by a plane or debris, was the only steel skyscraper in history to be destroyed by fire.

Democrats are extreme, radical Stepford wives trying to destroy America, American exceptionalism, capitalism, the U.S. Constitution and the middle class? Some of you might say, ", you're exaggerating." Nope. I'm not. I'm going to play the role of Paul Revere. I'm going to expose a bill in Congress championed by congressional Democrats called H.R. 5383: the New Way Forward Act, introduced in December. It's so extreme, radical, hateful and offensive toward American citizens that its only possible goal is the end of America. I believe it represents evil. But I'll report. You decide. The New Way Forward Act -- which supporters say is intended to "advance racial justice for immigration communities" -- says anyone and everyone in the world can come to America -- no laws, no papers, no background check required. It eliminates illegal immigration. And it makes it virtually impossible for anyone to ever again be deported, for any reason. Being here illegally will never again result in deportation. Neither will committing serious crimes. This bill brags about ending the "prison to deportation pipeline." No criminal can be deported for drug offenses, fraud or felonies. Not for depraved acts of moral turpitude, such as sexual assault, child abuse and sex crimes against children. Any crime that carries a sentence of less than five years will no longer result in deportation. In many cases, this includes manslaughter	UCCfagiHVb4vb-OrLGsdqrkA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCfagiHVb4vb-OrLGsdqrkA	1	UgwH6ZbGnuHpgNOrxuR4AaABAg	Richard Batchelder

Further Solyndra was taken down by the feds during Obama's administration. What about Burisma and China? China was very helpful in securing fast tracked trademarks for Ivanka after she visited during the trade war.

I am starting to go full solar this year on my home and RV as really it is outstanding but very costly upfront. But if people get everything needed over time bit by bit, it&#39;s not that bad. Installation is not that difficult to do yourself either but knowing the product to get confused a lot of people so knowledge is really power at the end of the day. It is a high paying job for those who do want to do it.	UCicJ0CTDtbfVo_Fk3zBND6A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCicJ0CTDtbfVo_Fk3zBND6A	0

Times have been leaning for this for nearly a decade period. It's people like you who had their brains bashed in with the political drama that you think everything is political related. Sure I believe the country should be with other power options in which it is clear that Biden is for but that's not why I stated what I did. If Trump would of stated to use other resources, I would of leaned more for him. But my views on alternative power is not based on political beliefs so you are wrong all the way, it is for my personal beliefs.

Even IF it were possible many homes aren't feasible to bear enough weight or space for solar or wind (like apartment buildings or mobile homes) . some places depend on propane and fuel oil to heat and cook. The energy to produce panels, wind mills and geothermal far exceeds any carbon savings.

If there is high unemployment and also high immigration, it creates a huge amount of competition for a limited number of jobs. Driving down wages and driving up housing prices and taxes. It only brings the poverty to this country. Also sending our military into Syria during his first week is a really bad sign. Also destroying girls sports....

Food stamps, medical coverage, and job training grants are available too if you're willing to sign up, and at no cost. If you're desperate for money, drive for Lyft, Uber, Amazon, etc., everyone could drive right? Plus, it's on your terms as an independent contractor. The truth is, people are too lazy to educate themselves for another skill and refuse to settle for a job that pays less than what they were earning before. With the executive order in place, no landlords or foreclosure proceedings can force you out of your apartment or house yet. Put in the effort if you want to live comfortably, there are 'Covid Relief Fund Scholarship' for low-income students and other grants for adult learning programs. When the gov says they want to protect USA trademarks and promote clean energy, get your certifications now so you can have good-paying jobs once it starts. Learn to move forward with the new Era. Economists, Investors, and Stock Traders are on board with the plan, so why the hesitation?

After 3 months of this nonsense, it isn&#39;t changing anyone&#39;s mind about what happened on November 3, 2020. It&#39;s just a constant reminder to over half of the people who voted that the man in the White House isn&#39;t who they marked on their ballots. Then if we decide to watch the content, it reminds us exactly why we voted for his opponent. Guess CBS and their pals who run the major internet platforms are trying to promote an insurrection. They must believe mass arrests will improve their sagging ratings and boost their advertising revenues. Guess they haven&#39;t figured out yet it is a lot easier to find the content we want somewhere else.	UCreF5iUXhzlACKz6h8M59VQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCreF5iUXhzlACKz6h8M59VQ	0

The problem at the end of the day is the majority of the people do not want change, it has been proven in statics and human nature in general but certain changes would indeed be helpful and proven successful. Take a look at all south American homes, they all work well off pure solar. Many other countries do as well however their countries go out of the way to assist. If we did solar here it has proven to be a major expense however doing it bit by bit really is not that bad nor hard to install yourself either. Knowing the products to be used can be tricky though. I did price checks and have intense knowledge of what to buy and how to build huge solar systems for my house and rv and doing so all during this year but for those that taken the time to master it, the jobs out there pay really well also so at the end of the day, operating off solar and wind and even water itself in certain areas is a lot more beneficial to living our daily lives without depending on other countries for their natural resources also.

The 60-day regulatory freeze is not causing the price of insulin to increase at community health centers, and there is no evidence to suggest the rule would further lower insulin costs at those facilities, which already offer deep discounts on medication.

You have people that are steady loosing their homes and kids are hungry and you are worried about climate control and American made stuff are you serious.

I‚Äôve not even heard of any major environmental problems relating to the pipeline, but either way, why not at least try to invest in improving it before destroying thousands of jobs in the midst of a pandemic? Also, he has no substitute at the ready, not to provide these workers with jobs or to remain energy-independent. Now gas prices will go way up, and Middle Eastern countries will have potential political leverage on America because we‚Äôre reliant on them.

UgzRbHPKlmvLvWbe6op4AaABAg.9J2OU0yZtD-9J2SwVhEvxj		1	2021-01-28 05:45:43	CL	@jordan dillon, if you actually knew anything about lithium ion batteries, you would know that there is very little lithium in them. They mostly contain Nickel and Aluminum in the case of Tesla's chemistry. More importantly, like all renewable technologies, the raw materials used to manufacture them are not destroyed. They do their job for decades and then can be recycled. Compare that to fossil fuels where the mined product is immediately consumed via combustion and has to be mined again, and again, and again....you get the idea. I would much rather mine something once for the life of the product than mine it hundreds of times over the life of the product.

The Flying Monkey does the Narcissist's Bidding to inflict additional torment on the target. It may consist of spying, spreading gossip, threatening, painting the Narcissist as the victim (Victim playing) and the target as the Perpetrator (Victim blaming). ....excerpted from Wikipedia ‚Ä∫ wiki ‚Ä∫ Flying_monkeys Do narcissists discard their Flying Monkeys? "Yes." With NO LOYALTY TO ANYONE, the Narcissist easily Discards the Flying Monkeys when they have done the damage intended.

Get oil from canada where the pipeline was but it comes on trucks then trolleys which is more carbon emission than a pipeline (a whole lot more)<br /><br />2. We go to war with the middle east ( transported on trucks then shipped which not only causes more emissions but oil spills.)<br /><br />And dont tell me clean energy because we dont have the technology for that no time soon so in the meantime how do you get oil for things such as cars, trains,airplanes,producing products that use oil, etc	UCLZxeohnX1ICQ4LxuiouMuQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLZxeohnX1ICQ4LxuiouMuQ	0

Like it or not, that's the way things are going (China is going green). Would the pipeline been nice? Sure. It would have been pretty brutal against nature putting it in. I think the idea is that in 4 years the need for a pipeline like that will no longer exist and we will be better off because of it. Call me naive or overly hopeful, but at least I feel there is hope for a greener future.

It only gets hairy when it breaches on legislation. These have been incredibly far from that. The amount doesn&#39;t matter. It&#39;s what they do and if they overstep legislation (they haven&#39;t yet).<br /><br />-Orders are a major way presidents get done work. He&#39;s doing his job. And making up for lots of lost time. It&#39;s completely ok to argue against what he is proposing, and you should if you feel that way. But just making a blanket argument that orders are overstep is absurd. It&#39;s literally their job and a tool they have<br /><br />-You can do many things at once. Just because an order was signed on federal use of energy, doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t tackle other pressing issues. He already has put out lots of orders for combating COVID, and even one for strengthening &quot;Made in America&quot; business	UChM1IIb32BmkvKVTbXYlf4g	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UChM1IIb32BmkvKVTbXYlf4g	0

Or do you mean through those wind turbines that the gear box takes 60 GALLONS of oil for friction reduction? Please tell us again how you plan on making energy without the use of fossil fuels to make the equipment that harnesses and stores the energy. Furthermore, please tell us why "we" (the descendants of the discoverer of electricity) have somehow not been able to manage this theory of yours for the 200 years wind and solar power have been in existence? Furthermore, it order to move electricity further than a set distance you need transformers. Transformers require .......guess what...... OILS! I can take a copper wire and wrap around an iron core then use my bicycle wheel axle to spin it past a magnet to provide electricity. The problem is it isn't practical no matter how "clean" it is. Also, electric wiring has coating on it. Did ya know that coating is made from.....wait for it....OIL. I guess you can produce all the eletricty you want but if you can't move it away from the bike(generator) via wiring and transformers then the electricity ain't worth a darn. Make sure when you go shopping next time you don't use their plastic bags. Or their plastic covered and rubber wheeled shopping carts. Make sure what you buy has no plastics or irons dug from the ground with fossil fuel burning equipment. Make sure when you dispose of those plastics that your local landfill isn't doing controlled burns of underground waste (where most trash is plastic). FYI, obama relegated billions of tax payer dollars to the "green energy" sector. Everyone of the solar and wind power companies quickly went bankrupt and closed up shop. Why you might ask? Because they are not a viable nor profitable means to energy. Imagine that!	UCAqt4T4SZkZoh-9JZq2T9Qg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAqt4T4SZkZoh-9JZq2T9Qg	1	UgzecpMoPUoSgx2i_KV4AaABAg	MadAnth0ny C

New developments that will bring more jobs, more activity and business to existing establishments, and more tax revenue for the local community, and people don‚Äôt want that? I‚Äôm not too surprised either, the folks in the town of the last school I went to were fine with abandoned buildings and empty lots and would literally spearhead opposition to any new businesses opening in town. People are so opposed to any sort of change good or bad, and then they wonder why they are in such poor economic shape.<br /><br />It‚Äôs fine not to agree on everything when it comes to politics, but the amount of comments I‚Äôve seen complaining about that one particular issue to me is hilarious.

We haven't had a pointless war in a while, that's probably why he sent a military force into Syria last week and appointed a member of Raytheon's (3rd largest US defense contractor) board of directors as Secretary of Defense. Gas prices have been manageable for a few years so he killed the keystone pipeline and ensured a substantial increase in gas prices. $5 per gallon during the Obama era wasn't fun... I could keep going but its getting wordy. You should pay attention to what he's actually signing.

The issue is not that people do not want the renewable energy, fact is we are not developed enough as a country to make this dramatic switch without the progress already made in advance. Its poor execution on Biden's plan. He is posing a danger to a major collapse. We dont even have many charging stations for these cars and think about farmers do they have electric tractors.....so much is not ready. It needs to happen renewable energy but it needs to be a smooth transition when they fade out these resources. This is too abrupt and America will certainly suffer, all during a pandemic.

This is like a Dad of a family of 6 kids says pack everything up I have sold the house we are moving to this super renewable and smart home. The family arrives at the site but the new house has not been built, this family is left without shelter and comfort.

Solar panel manufacturing involves plenty of chemicals and solar panels CANNOT BE RECYCLED. They just stack them up. Wind turbines.....the blades are NOT RECYCLABLE and they end up in landfills where they will not decompose. Car batteries......manufacturing involves chemicals. They have to be replaced regularly. They are NON RECYCLABLE. I haven't looked it up, but I'm pretty sure they use petroleum products in the manufacturing of these items. In fact, we're absolutely dependent upon petroleum. The PPE you wear, the rubber in your tires, car parts, plastics, and practically everything else you touch. Check out the landfills. Petroleum products everywhere. Nuclear power is good, but people are afraid of it. If we didn't build nuclear plants in areas prone to earthquakes, it would help. If we put generators on ROOFS instead of BASEMENTS we'd be better off. There are a lot of problems with the current technology. It's not ready to take the load. Be sure to wear your BIDEN T Shirt when the city water pumps give out and you have rolling power outages.....oops too late for that one, huh?

So guess what will happen. Vice president will run country and green deal is knocking on the door.Good buy to 2 amendment and accept massive unemployment in all labour jobs and anything related to oil and gas. But if you put on tight pants ride electric scooter made in China drink chai latte and smoke to much weed and find 10 roommates maybe you will be able to push paper somewhere .It is all good to do this in the name of planet and emissions.

Get oil from canada where the pipeline was but it comes on trucks then trolleys which is more carbon emission than a pipeline (a whole lot more) 2. We go to war with the middle east ( transported on trucks then shipped which not only causes more emissions but oil spills.) And dont tell me clean energy because we dont have the technology for that no time soon so in the meantime how do you get oil for things such as cars, trains,airplanes,producing products that use oil, etc	UCLZxeohnX1ICQ4LxuiouMuQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLZxeohnX1ICQ4LxuiouMuQ	1	UgzfBo85BRfn3miud7h4AaABAg	AKAVENOM

With regards to your healthcare points, I 100% agree that insurance companies shouldnt be involved in government healthcare plans as profit shouldnt be the objective of these plans.

Healthcare would be better off without insurance companies profiting just for being the middleman. Climate change isn't real, but if it was you aren't changing anything without China, India and Indonesia on board. They pollute 10 times more than the Paris Accord Nations, you know because they hold 1/3 the world population if not more? Knowledgeable people know its crap, so let's get something real done and not this dumpster fire called ACA or Bidencare which will be worse.

Minimum wage has to keep up with inflation, 7.25 an hour simply isn't enough anymore. The fossil fuel industry is dying.

You are in no way obligated to use someone's preferred pronouns. You are free to call them whatever you want. But the rest of us are also free to judge you accordingly. Freedom goes both ways. For the record, I think you're the one who's making a simple thing difficult. For the most part there are 3 sets of pronouns: he/him, she/her, they/them. Is it really that complicated? There are thousands of different names and you memorize hundreds of names and faces, and yet you complain about the immense effort of inquiring which of 3 different words someone prefers? I can tolerate people's opinions that don't line up with mine, but I do not respect people who stubbornly refuse to afford basic respect and courtesy to others, especially when those people are already faced with constant and brutal hate. It's not the opinion I don't respect, but the attitude.	UCUVee7YlcnOgknMmDpYgYfg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUVee7YlcnOgknMmDpYgYfg	1	UgxFbeN_Tg4FeEPps6t4AaABAg	SouthSide

We shouldn‚Äôt have to inquire about people‚Äôs gender before speaking with them. Don‚Äôt make something simple, difficult. There‚Äôs 2 genders, male and female. You want to push your views and beliefs onto others and get mad when they don‚Äôt conform. There are 2 genders, you don‚Äôt agree. That‚Äôs fine. You believe gender is a spectrum and there isn‚Äôt a number to how many genders exist. Believe that, but don‚Äôt expect everybody to jump on that band wagon.

Yes, that is what science tells us. It's a word. Science tells us there are 2 SEXES‚Ä¶not genders, sexes. Sex is a scientific term, gender is not. Therefore science doesn't say anything about how many genders there are. Why don't you just let people call themselves what they want and mind your own business? Trans people want you dead, right? I think that's unlikely, considering they're a bit busy being murdered at a disproportionately high rate.

The story of the ~magical~ laptop actually started on a podcats/youtube channel owned by Guo Wengui. Supposedly there were THREE üòÇ. Guo is the billionaire whose yacht Steve Bannon was arrested on. They interviewed someone claiming to be a Chinese dissident and talked about 3 laptops that the Chinese government had gained possession of and were using as leverage on Biden and the democratic party. Many of the details of what was supposed to be on the first laptop match up with the reporting about the laptop Rudy Giuliani was in possession of. And interestingly enough Rudy actually met with Guo not too long ago, they posted pictures smoking cigars together on Instagram. It was really the Trumps working with Chinese intel all along and still came out empty handed so they had to make up some BS that went absolytly nowhere.

This is like being in the 1900s saying "well cars aren't as safe as horses, we should wait til technology makes the car safer than horses, until then let's just keep using horses". Also you need to really stop thinking of other countries as "our enemy", not only that, but you talk of China as our enemy, while refusing to do anything to actually beat them on the world stage. Right now China is the number 1 investor in green energy, any technology that gets produced in the green sector is going to come from China unless the US actually steps up and invests in the technology, and by investing in the technology we will be able to sell our tech and have a booming economy. Right now China got the leg up my guy. We have nothing to lose at this point. We can easily cut our military budget in half, still be the most funded military in the world, and have tons of money to invest in infrastructure, Healthcare, and green energy.

Is their bad air quality a symptom of large scale coal use? Yes, I fail to see how this is an argument against green infrastructure because you've literally made my argument for me. The air quality is bad, therefore we must invest in green energy to improve air quality.

In involves all forms of clean energy: Water, air, and sun. Will it cost a lot of money? Yes, but do you know what else cost us a lot of money, that ended up making us a lot more money? The interstate highways. This is no different from those. Its an investment in the future of the nation and will more than make up for its upfront cost.

Notice how China is investing in things like high speed rail and renewable energy? Would you like to know how much China spends on green energy? In 2017, which are the most recent stats i could find, they spend 126 billion USD on green energy, that accounts for nearly 50% of all funding for renewable energy worldwide, which is about 280 billion USD. The US only spent 59 billion in 2019 on green energy. You want to beat China? Dont latch onto a dying energy source and invest in the energy source of the future and invest in high speed rail. Theres a reason China laps us on the world stage and its not because of fossil fuels. Its because we spend most of our money on military whereas they spend their money on more important things.

Yeah germany is smaller, but guess what, we have more money than germany so we can do it. In fact, if you payed attention you'd know we already subsidize the fossil fuel industry. In fact we spend 20 billion a year on it. And you wanna know how much we spend on military? 934 billion a year. That's more than the next 10 countries combined. Do we really need to be that extra? Any right minded person would say no, we could cut that spending in half and still be fine. We could divert that funding elsewhere and we can stop subsidizing oil and have even more money to subsidize green energy.

Put the need for petroleum will always exist. So many things we use everyday have a petroleum by product in it or in making it. Currently though America is in a rough time right now. He needs to focus on this pandemic, the jobs thats been lost by it. Cutting more jobs right now only makes it worse. The agenda he is following isn't one that does America any good right now. In other words "things that could wait" until we get on our feet again. Let's take care of our own nation first. Its hard to heal a wound when you keep getting wounded...

How many teslas, hybrids or electric vehicles do you see? Cuz I see a ton. We are making steps that help, China and India aren't going to follow suit just because we did it. There is no gain of function for them to do it. They are industrializing. China makes all our stuff in child sweatshops. Your priorities are heavily skewed. We fix big problems first, then smaller ones. Biden is in China's pocket. Wealth redistribution from closed small businesses to giant mega corporations like Amazon and Walmart, while the government has printed over 66% of ALL of the money we've EVER HAD in the past 6 months, creating insane inflation and destroying the country.

No one is doom saying except those like you who want to act like the world is going to end tomorrow. Tell me, when did Al Gore do his climate change documentary? 2006. 15 years ago. In the documentary he warns about ice caps melting and sea levels rising and all sorts of stuff, that was supposed to happen by now. It hasn't. The timescales for this stuff are beyond a single Human life time. China and India have about 2.7 billion people combined. They produce the most pollution. Don't see Greta telling them how dare they. Don't see you saying anything about it. The West is not who needs to work harder to reduce pollution, it is the East. You want actual change that might help your descendants live comfortably?

I've travelled most of the USA in the past few years, never once really noticed air problems. I've been to China 5 times in that same time span. Each time I feel I can barely breathe. If we spend trillions on "changing the climate" while China and India do nothing, it will be trillions of totally wasted dollars.

Almost 200 years to be frank. Shutting down the pipeline won't stop oil from being shipped btw. The fact is that green energy isn't viable due to cost efficiency and usability. Do you really believe seattle would fair well on solar power? They sure don't have enough space for wind turbine farms. Even if they could use either don't you realize to produce the equipment to harness and store green energy requires just as much fossil fuels. Not to mention the new waste it creates. Let me know how that solar power works out for you after 150mph wind shreds your turbine fans during a hurricane on the coasts. Humanity: please let's evolve and make our ways of living simpler. Democrats: let's go back in time 200 years and use wind and solar power so that half the world can be without electricity and running water.

By studying these these different structures we can see that carbon dioxide is not the cause cause of global financial or cooling but a following of each cycle of temperature change .

Indeed, the only way for us to effectively fight climate change is with the help of fossil fuels. Renewable energy from the sun and the wind are simply not enough. They are not even enough to satisfy our increasing appetite for power. <br />Nuclear and hydro can certainly help but even these two are not enough. The only way we can make up for the balance of the power we need is with blue hydrogen which is made from natural gas using carbon capture and storage. There is lots and lots of natural gas all over the world to help us do this, including right here in the United States and nearby Canada. Aside from blue hydrogen, we can also make ammonia to power airplanes and ships; and to make fertilizer and steel. Indeed, ammonia will become the medium to transport the hydrogen since it holds 150% more hydrogen than liquid hydrogen itself. So yes, fossil fuels are necessary partners in our Herculean efforts at decarbonization -- integral ones if we are to make a dent on climate change. And we must make a dent -- or else.

This idiot will destroy America in no time....just one example is putting us back in the Paris Climate Accord where America must immediately institute expensive changes that will force many companies to shutter their doors....while China and India stand out as two prime examples of countries also part of the agreement needing to make the same changes, but they are not asked to make a single damn change....keep right on doing what you are doing. We&#39;ll have America be the sucker. WE ARE SO DAMN SICK OF THIS! Our industry is laid to waste .... others keep right on. It would be entirely different if EVERY country were forced to make the same changes at the same time. Biden is such an IDIOT....putting every other flipping country before the needs of our own!

The university handles him with kit gloves and let&#39;s him do whatever he wants. He claims to do a study on climate and writes a paper on it. When challenged and asked for the data he based his paper on, he refuses. The university also refuses and says this data cannot be released for a year. In a year, the university refuses again as does the &quot;Professor&quot;. Eventually they delete the paper because it could now stand scrutiny. This is what they are claiming to be a &quot;Climate scientist&quot;. Of course the professor still has his job because he is a minority but the human race is now being sold this lie by liberals.

But excess carbon released into the atmosphere by human activity has caused a change of 2 degrees Celsius over the last ~150 years, an unprecedented rise for such a short time span. What‚Äôs more, as the global climate becomes warmer and ice caps (like the Laurentide Ice Sheet in Greenland) melt, carbon dioxide trapped in that ice gets released and makes the problem worse. If we want to avoid the worst effects of our climate changing (because some effects are already here), we must change actions on a macro scale and the structures of our economy/society that release carbon (and other Greenhouse gases like Methane) into the atmosphere.

EVERYTHING you buy just went up exponentially. Off shore wind energy? So how is putting wind generators in the ocean safe for the environment? Whale migration routes? Seabirds and marine resources? How will you protect them? What do I know, I&#39;ve only been a commercial fisherman for over 30 years. F*** your wind farm!

Then both the American and Canadian armed forces has been there for years and still there today going in front of the pipeline clearing out, elliminating (killing) and scaring away highly protected predator species out from in front of those installing the keystone pipeline for these temporary jobs. Most Americans let alone the world rarely heard about that but it's noted by all the locals who reside around here from information from both the armed forces and the pipeline workers who mentioned it. This is wrong period for these animals to be harmed. It is on many reports online but with previous Administrations not discussing it, most don't know about these issues unless they research. It really was not a good idea to begin with overall. Debates have went on in the courts about the pipeline so the workers known their jobs could of ended at anytime to find alternative employment and they can't cry about it now at all. I am not against the workers still though and believe the American and Canadian government should join together to assist them finding other employment such as giving them paid training in solar and such but the pipeline needed to end period as it was more harmful than anything. Furthermore in regards to the highly protected endangered species, We went into their homes, they did not come into ours. We need to see that they are still protected to prevent extinction of more species.

Their job is to work for the construction company which is contracted by the government with only 1,000 workers currently there(11,000 projected if it wasn‚Äôt axed) and the companies will just move on to a different contract. This pipeline is also useless, when it was proposed a decade ago oil prices were double what they are now. Along with this a peak could be devastating to local water supplies and wildlife.

Yes Biden is right that we need to take care of our planet and shift from oil/petroleum burning to more greener options, but do this over one or two presidencies (so the next 4-8 years). Not everything has to be done this year. My concern is that we will continue to jack up the national debt and at some point, it will reach a critical point to where it may be harder for the US to get the funding it needs, not to mention the increase in inflation (some inflation is good, but too much is bad). Again, I&#39;m onboard with most of Biden&#39;s plans, but I think he&#39;s try to do too much, too quick. Let&#39;s get (buy) the vaccines and get the virus under control first, then we can start working on the the &quot;greener&quot; things that are not so much an immediate concern.

We will still need to meet our oil demands. If we are extracting less oil from our own lands we need to go somewhere else to get it. We need oil. Biden&#39;s cabinet has stated exactly where they think we can get oil from. <br /><br />Prepare for more Americans to senselessly die in the Middle East while we create the next generation of extremist terrorists from the Middle East.

Cut fossil fuel emissions and ramp up green fuel and you see this as a job creator....<br /><br />Is the Biden Administration going to provide jobs to the 11,000 employees they put on the unemployment line when he ceased production of the Keystone Pipeline? How about all the fracking workers who are now out of work because of Biden&#39;s lies about not stopping fracking. Joe Biden stood on stage, looked directly into the camera and PROMISED he would not end fracking. <br /><br />It&#39;s really no surprise considering in 47 years he hasn&#39;t done a single thing except get rich.

That is like quiting your job because you plan on working in an industry that does not yet exist. This is putting the cart before the horse.

We don't know how many jobs are lost because many of them are trickle down economic losses. Meaning that transportation of oil just got higher in the usa. That means all businesses will be raising prices and laying off workers. When 1000 people are directly effected that means 1000 less starbucks being served in the area they were working. It means 1000 less rooms rented. It means 1000 less meals served. It means 1000 less opportunities to sell entertainment. Funny how that 1000 so quickly balloons into 8000 but I guess your real knowledge in economics comes from SNL doesn't it?

While I don't fully support the stimulus checks (mainly money going to people who don't need it) at least Biden is onboard with the same ideas as Trump: Americans who are hurting need the money and $600 doesn't cut it.

How difficult is it to refuel a solar panel, wind turbine, geothermal plant or nuclear reactor? Oil, coal and gas are literally dinosaurs. Oh, we need to even out the power grid? well, there's batteries (god i hope free standing Li+ ones go away, such a waste of resources) but there's also using excess electricity to create liquid O and H... and possibly retrofitting LNG and other pipelines to ship O2 or H2. Why should we do this? well, if you've seen Galveston, TX you'd know there are miles and miles of refineries in a very dense area. An attack there would cripple the US for months.. Also if you've seen America's response to Covid-19, you'd know that the USA is vulnerable to a biological attack (the reason I know covid-19 was an accident is no one shelled Galveston). But if there's a more distributed source of electricity, along with everyone using electricity for home heating and cooking as well as the usual.. then we don't have the same Achilles' heel vs what we have now.

Such as firing everyone who disagreed with him, giving Continuous help to billionaires, pulling us out of IMPORTANT intergovernmental programs such as WHO and the Paris Accords, attempting to overthrow a lawful election, and attempting to "persuade" the governor of georgia to "find" more votes. You seem to think that dictatorships are created by overthrowing the prior government like the french revolution. But germany would disagree. That was fully legal how they obtained power and changed it so they kept it. This isn't a simple topic.

Bernie was. But we have Biden. He is President. This is a good first step toward a future without multiple very destructive fires, tornadoes, unpredictable droughts and floods and hurricanes anually costing many billions of tax dollars annually. Biden is President and when he does the right thing I am able to acknowledge reality and the good things he does. If you still cling to obviously foolish and cultists propaganda, you need help adjusting to reality. Biden is President. Your wanna be dictator is a fat old guy playing golf in Florida with the palmetto bugs, humidity and other fat old dinosaurs. He lost, lost, lost.

Clean energy is considered energy that doesn't require burning fossil fuels to create the heat that creates the movement. Clean energy can be produced by wrapping a copper wire around an iron core and spinning it on a bicycle wheel axle past a magnet. However, it's not a viable source to continually power anything. I think what you're wanting to say is 'how do we manufacture the storage or harnessing devices for the clean energy'. That in itself requires fossil fuels ironically	UCAqt4T4SZkZoh-9JZq2T9Qg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAqt4T4SZkZoh-9JZq2T9Qg	1	UgzgnwLQINhrHv0jLDV4AaABAg	Karl Apel

And Biden won, so not sure about the creepy header, but due to he absolutely horrific actions at the capital on six January, I‚Äôll let my annoyance pass.<br /><br />This policy, on climate is a crisis and ‚Äúenvironmental justice‚Äù whatever that may be, or science integrity or equity or any of the other phrases, contrary to the report are decent ideas for a country in a position to absorb that. Contrary to the report, the energy revolution is not as cut and dried as thy make it out to be. Renewable sources of energy do not have the capacity to provide requirements, energy requirements and there is zero proof it will provide either the jobs or energy that this report falsely claims. I wish it were true on both accounts, but cbs news is lying to yo today, at this point. I don‚Äôt know why they did nor do I know why they did not make an honest assessment of energy at this point in time. Why does this matter?<br /><br />Young innovators and future inventors could watch ‚Äúnews reports‚Äù like this falsehood and decide to go and push their inventive energy toward the next big video game or whatever and not the science we actually need to improve our environment. Joe has made solving the problem harder and so has cbs news. By not speaking truthfully and honestly, as well as not ensuring our near term energy needs.

Laborers cant work from home......... These communities are going to end up the same way the US auto industry left so many Americans. Automation was only a part of it........ manufacturing jobs sent overseas or eliminated. I&#39;m tired of this jackassed party putting faith, and US citizens lives in the hands of foreign nations.

Look into what it takes to mine for the precious metals involved in solar, and battery storage in order to make the renewables even remotely reliable. There would be rolling blackouts without having coal, natural gas, nuclear power. If we don't produce it then China or India and Saudi Arabia still will. The US emissions are already much lower than most other countries, and we have very reliable power.

Electric only will require a lot more charging stations and it will not be a 3 minute fill up. Most people let their phone battery die and you think you will remember to charge your battery in the car? Look around at how many gas stations are so busy you have to wait to fill up. Now imagine waiting several hours because that is what it will take for any kind of range and the cost of infrastructure per station will be crazy. Not only that but where will the electricity come from? I am an alternative fuels technician and I can tell you I love the technology but realistically it can&#39;t happen soon at all on a mass scale.

I didn't care for shutting down the XL upgrade and bypass of the Keystone pipeline. The 1000 barrel a day shortfall will continue to be covered by train and tanker shipments, it won't stop oil refineries, drilling in Canada and will keep us polluting with crude oil shipments via trucks and trains. If Biden flat out said he wants to refine less oil, I wouldn't like it, but I would understand why and where he is going with the decision. That would fit into his goals.

At the same time before the pandemic unemployment was at its lowest and GDP was growing steadily. Obama doubled our unemployment rate after the economy was getting ‚Äúbetter‚Äù in 2010. But in reality he just created more government sector jobs and unions which rely on tax payer money. Just weighting out pros and cons to both sides. Just seems like the liberals need a little more reminding about what events too place. Remember that Trump waved his ‚Äúmagic wand‚Äù to get back Courier to the US though the still ended up leaving.

Prior to covid trump had unemployment at a record low, stock market booming, raised military pay, increased pensions/retirement funds, and the largest increase to jobs labeled as goods producing since the 80s. Biden has violated his own FIRST EXECUTIVE ORDER AS PRESIDENT, focused on impressing transgenders by protecting boys who can't hack it to play with your daughters instead, and costing an estimated 3 million plus jobs by the time this is over. Oh and his entire covid plan is the exact same as trumps, but now the media calls it great instead of racist and anti Muslim. The same plan that was actually created by Obama and then just implemented by trump.

The climate is changing due to the fact that there‚Äôs a 1000x‚Äôs more people living on this world then there was In the 20‚Äôs. We drive cars, fly airplanes,burn and destroy our forests and create 1000‚Äôs more tons of garbage. It‚Äôs progression, and that‚Äôs the way it‚Äôs going to keep going no matter what we try and do to stop it, the climate will continue to change, even with the idiot Biden and his master plans to change things.all at tax payers expense.

The report does state: "Changes in the United States of America‚Äôs emissions continue to be driven by the shift away from coal towards gas and renewables." Which, by the way, is no thanks to your tRump king. I believe he touted something like "I'm bringing coal back!" It also points out that emissions are down recently due to the pandemic (less people driving, etc).

So what you see is actually online teolls who usually have more than one account. For example: The FandomMenace said on Youtube they were going to show up to StarWars celebration 2019 and crash it, holding protests in the street. They never did, only a handful showed up and none did anything. That is because they number in the few, not the many. To point towards this Maga movement: There are supposedly millions upon millions, but only a few thousand showed up at the Capitol, and they had help getting in! By contrast, literally millions hit the streets to celebrate nationwide on Bidens victory. Just like the FandomMenace to Starwars, Maga is a tiny movement made up of losers who have multiple accounts. If not, then why do only a few ever show up in real life???

I can tell that you're not spreading any hatred, and it's not wrong to encourage people to see it for themselves--there's absolutely no harm in trying to get people to simply think and wake up the way that you did. Unfortunately, too many people rely on main stream media because they'd prefer to be 'spoonfed' "information". It's brainwashing and is sad. It also doesn't take a lot of work to back out of the media single-sided perspective to see the bigger picture and realize that the only thing holding them back from the truth is their unwillingness (and it's not an inability) to think for themselves. The best way I can put it is that Biden is like a bad infomercial. If Don Lemon and all of the overpaid celebrities are endorsing something, it must be a great product. Call it that, put a 'fact-checker' on it (ie, the money-back guarantee that's riddled with obstacles). Only, in reality, those overpaid celebrities couldn't possibly know how to relate to the values of the everyday average "Joe", and they won't disclose how much they were paid to tell you the product really works. And when that product fails to work and burns the buyer's house down (which they'd know was a threat if they'd done their research), the lawsuit they file gets thrown out because there is no proof (of election fraud)... But this is while the lawyer they're paying failed to allow the evidence of the faulty product be presented, and all the neighbors are blaming the boy next door anyway (Trump). So I feel badly for those people too, because they might get their money back in 4 years, but it cost them and many others infinitely more than that. I hate to use analogies, but it's so true. We all know and probably love someone who fails to see something for what it really is, so it's not wrong to try to guide them to look at the true nature of something before it destroys them. I too fear for America, and know a few people who lost their jobs due to Joe's first week in office. One sadly now has an overbearing mortgage that they recently took on and a baby on the way, so I greatly hope that something can be done for these people, regardless of who they voted for.

I'm sure you know the time is shortly coming that the government, led by a Biden administration, will deem Qanon and their supporters a terrorist organization and start placing people in jail. So my question is what is the plan for that? When the government starts arresting people with Qanon tattoos and broswer histories that show that they are involved in it then how do you and the others expect to get out of it?

Yes, read the articles, read everything. Not many people do, so we tell them to do the research. Nothing in it that equates to prosecutable charges is not for you to determine. Your argument is based on your own biased emotional outlook, and on nothing in reality. Biden doesn't need any new bombshell accusations, the old ones are just fine, they simply need to be heard. News media suppressed the Hunter Biden story prior to the election and claimed it was conspiracy lies, post election admitted it was true. This is what happens with everything. People cannot care if they do not know what it is and why it is important. You are no arbiter here.

Pete Schweizer's "Secret Empires" opened my eyes back in 2017 about the Biden crime family, the Kerry's the Obama's, etc. I was shocked (but not that shocked) to find that no 'main stream media' would ever cover what that book did when Biden ran for the 2020 ballot. Funnily enough, it spoke about the evidence found on Hunter's laptop (that was censored) and goes back to the Obama administration, and Biden acting through his son's shady companies because there was no foreign policy that the offspring of elected officials couldn't make private deals with foreign powers. The business deals lined the pockets of the Biden family, but threatened national security, and Obama knew about it. Wouldn't a true leader want to clear the air once and for all to discredit such blasphemy? Or would you censor and shut someone up if it was just a lie anyway?

November 5th, 2008 to see Obama's supporters proudly waving Communist flags after the election. Can you imagine? What happened to this once great society in which we live? The saddest part is that most of the American people actually want Communism, because they've only seen it's friendly side thus far. The¬†dark side of Communism¬†will soon come upon us in America. Sadly, the average American citizen won't wake up until it directly affects them adversely. Communism is not an ideology; but rather, a secret weapon of¬†THE ILLUMINATI¬†intended to enslaved the human race. America's love for sin has made our nation weak, complacent and indifferent. This has been¬†by design,¬†by the Communists, who have¬†engineered this mess. For those who have studied, then you know that Communism was¬†created by the Banksters¬†(i.e., the New World Order gang), as a vehicle by which to achieve world government. This plot goes back not only centuries, but millenniums, as Satan is the god of this world (2nd Corinthians 4:4) and has desired to finish what God stopped at the tower AND CITY of Babel (Genesis 11:7-8). The detached capstone on¬†The Great Pyramid¬†(displayed on the back of every U.S. dollar), represents the unfinished tower and city of Babel, which will be the Beast system of the coming Antichrist, aka, the New World Order. You'll never hear THE TRUTH explained any simpler than what I just gave you. This is what is going on in the world today, from a Biblical perspective by a born-again Christian.

Do your homework, Mainstrean is trying to cancel Margorie Green without mentioning the pending impeachment of Biden.

Why do government's always tell the climate scientists the outcome they want, not what the truth is but what fits the agenda? Why are the forecasts always linear trajectories that extend into perpetuity which we all know is impossible? Why do people listen to Greta, a clueless shill being used by the Marxists in Davos to push the UN2030 agenda? The answers are why I no longer work in the public sector as a climatologist but rather am in private consulting. The answers are: because it's all about the money. Socialism has run out of money and governments want another revenue stream. The truth left town a long time ago.

You mean the 11000 jobs that dont actually exist yet, for the pipeline extension that only had 1.2 miles built. The same pipeline that has been trying to get approved for 12 years but hasnt been able to due to real environmental concerns. Lets think about this for a sec....12 years. 12 years in court. Hmmmm sounds to me like it shouldnt have been approved at all. But the orange did, one because he doesnt believe in science and two because certainly after 12 years in court getting denied permits to build the extension to the pipeline, they paid out big bucks to the con man that ran our government. There werent 11000 jobs lost. The jobs dont exist yet and with only 1.2 miles of the pipeline built those 11000 jobs wouldnt be available anytime soon. Further that 11000 number is an estimate listed by the company of how many americans they believe they would hire. They also stated most of those jobs would be temporary. Biden did not shut down the existing pipeline. He revoked the permit that allowed the extension of an existing pipeline.

A short period of economic pain for a civilization over the cost of transport is worth the pain when faced with altering the course of climate change. I'll take that trade. All the more reason to accelerate our shift toward renewable energy sources and electric vehicles. As far as the environmental impacts, transporting the oil by ship and train, while again, not being great in the short term, is better than the effects up ramping up production of fossil fuels and creating yet another artery for us to pump the black blood. This strain will hurt the oil industry in our country, and yet again, force the transition to green renewable energy sources. A panful, but necessary change. I don't know if you think all progress will be painless, or if you actually think that the world will survive the constant pollution we produce, but neither of those things are how its going to be.

That pipeline was our key to producing enough refined oil in North America to set our prices free of OPEC. Gas prices are inevitably going to rise significantly now and Biden has already sent a military force into the Northeast oil region of Syria. You may also be overestimating the environmental impact. Without the pipeline, the oil is going to be transport via ship, rail and road, which is going to create much more pollution over time than simply piping the oil underground.

No one lost those jobs, as they did not yet exist. Furthermore those 10k jobs were temporary jobs, with the Canadian company that owns the keystone pipeline stating that at the most only 1000 jobs would be able to be considered permanent jobs. And on top of that, 10k jobs is nothing when pitted against all of the environmental damage the keystone pipeline would do.

Well, I guess that actually made some power unlike the 100&#39;s of billions we spent of solar development that China bought for a dime on the dollar when Obama&#39;s hand picked companies went bankrupt. this should work out even worse. Good times, comrades. At least the gyrating talking heads trying to spin this positive are sure creative. Destroying 2 industries and idling tens of thousands of high paying jobs is progress in the minds of a liberal. A simple question: when in earth&#39;s history has the climate NOT changed. The &#39;settled&#39; science has not agreed CO2 even plays a part. Doesn&#39;t anyone listening to or producing this channel know this?

In order to match the 57% increase in the DJI that President Trump gave us in just four years, the DJI must rise under Biden to 49K by Jan. 20th, 2025. I don't like his chances. Also, Trump didn't start any new wars. If Biden starts ONE new war, he will be a failure as President.

So Saudi Arabia, Russia, Venezuela, Kuwait etc will fill the void. They also have mush worse environmental policies. We produce much cleaner and safer ways to extract oil. We were energy independent under Trump. Now we will have absolutely no say or leverage, the cost of gas will increase, the cost of goods and services will drastically increase. And hundreds of thousands of Americans will slowly lose their jobs. The oil industry was one of the last big industries left that paid well in the US. We have already lost manufacturing overseas. How you people don‚Äôt understand that the entire planet runs on oil and green energies barely make up 1% of that sector is baffling. To start drastically eliminating these jobs and infrastructure before we have a sound green energy infrastructure in place is suicide. Why not slowly taper down our fossil fuel industry, and build up renewables in the process? It needs to be a balancing act. We can‚Äôt just jump off the scale all at once. And that seems to be the insanity of Biden‚Äôs and the lefts new policies. Rather then drastically cutting these jobs and infrastructure immediately, and being at the whim of other countries for the next 50 years because we don‚Äôt produce our own oil, we need to slowly let off the gas, rather then hitting the emergency breaks.

Two of which focused on ending private prisons as well as rejoining the Paris Accord. How is that remotely bad? Lol Leave the country. Your unintelligent hateful kind needs to leave. One of the first exec orders Trump signed was TRAVEL BAN. Do you even know what that is or..... are you a grown adult sounding like a teenager bickering over..... nothing? Only things of value shine.

Always has and always will regardless of what we do. It has much to do with how the Planet rotates and the distance to the Sun. According to your own data from the UN your types constantly push, the overall global temps have risen less than 1 degree. Their plans along with bidens is to spend 100 Trillion over 100 years in HOPES of bringing global temps down a fraction of a degree. But let's look the evidence. Are storms getting worse? Fact: No. Are there more storms compared to the last thousand years? Fact: No. Are more people dying from climate related changes? Fact: No. Due to the fact that we keep advancing our technology, its to the point we can weather and survive most extremities. What about sea levels? It's estimated in the last 100 years, sea levels have risen 2-8 inches........ As time goes on, more and more companies are advancing their technology, and recycling to save money and cut costs and provide higher quality products all of which lower their carbon foot print. Ergo, companies advancing are doing far more for far cheap on this "climate change" hysteria than any government can do and they're doing it cheaply and completely on accident. So, these are are all data backed facts. So, yeah. YOUR feelings are not based on actual facts but cherry picked data from those who wish to push the hysteria for $$	UCLTPMVymqaf6uT42brmNU7Q	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLTPMVymqaf6uT42brmNU7Q	1	UgwacwMcsBnCRnVltEp4AaABAg	RedMasque

There were 13 senators that sponsored the Green New Deal; you think Joe was one of them? NFW! There were 96 House signatories but the House Energy Chair isn&#39;t one of them either.

Carbon Emissions have been at an all time high in the past couple of years, which weaken the Ozone layer and makes it hotter. Are you anti-science? You say "lobbyists" but it's actually the opposite. Lobbyists working from the fossil fuel companies who want to protect their profits so they can deny any climate change policies and so they can get fools like you to side with them. But anyways, what kind of "lobbyists" would be in support of climate change and for what reason? Surely you have no idea what you are talking about.
