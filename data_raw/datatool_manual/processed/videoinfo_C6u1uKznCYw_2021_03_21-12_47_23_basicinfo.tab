title	Joe Biden Breaks Down Donald Trump, Climate Change and The Election | Pod Save America
description	Democratic presidential nominee @Joe Biden joins Dan Pfeiffer and Jon Lovett to talk about what’s at stake for our democracy in the 2020 election, his final debate with Donald Trump, his plans for tackling the climate crisis, Vote Early Day, and what everyone can do to help in the final days of the campaign. The election is almost here. Find everything you need to vote + help your friends to vote at https://votesaveamerica.com. Let's do this thing. Subscribe to our channel! https://www.youtube.com/crookedmedia?sub_confirmation=1 Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.
