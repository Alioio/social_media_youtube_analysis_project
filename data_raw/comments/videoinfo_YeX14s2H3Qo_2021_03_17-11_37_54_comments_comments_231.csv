Selection of species that are large canopy trees and that have high carbon sequestration rates is one of the most effective ways to accomplish this. As mentioned in the video though it&#39;s also important to have understory trees and plant material to support the overall ecosystem of that space. This is an amazingly easy and relatively inexpensive way to address this issue or at least make a considerable dent. It does however as mentioned take future planning. Most trees will take ~20+ years to grow large enough to where you will begin to realize these benefits. The larger the tree the greater the overall net benefits. Speaking as a municipal arborist, there are also many untapped opportunities to add to Urban forests as well, so while planting large swaths of forests in open spaces is a great use of unused land, we can also plant in Urban space where there is greater concentrated pollution. Urban factors often shorten the average lifespan of trees but the service they provide in these spaces are just as important.",UCStJ_JsKrgrdX1igdF8Audg,0,Ugy7hfm1K_VmonVTNq94AaABAg,YeX14s2H3Qo,2019-07-08 16:32:52
