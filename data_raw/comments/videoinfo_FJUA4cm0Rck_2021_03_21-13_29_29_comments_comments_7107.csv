The facts that you are listing are either banalities, oft-cited scientifically results or unsupported claims. - the debate over the Holocene conendrum was amply discussed in science magazines and newspapers, it was not overlooked nor kept secret in the media. But this debate has evolved, and is now nearing its end: temperatures were not higher then than they are now. - yes, we are in the Pleistocene glaciation, but we are in the Holocene interglacial period, which is marked by warmer temps since 12,000 years ago allowing human civilizations to thrive. What is problematic is not that GMST are rising, it's that it's rising at an abnormal rate. - global temperatures have not strayed out of model projections in recent years, they fall within projected error bars. - we don't know how the world is going to be in several centuries from now. Since we're in an interglacial, there's a glacial period ahead, but that's thousands of years from now. What's at stake is not the state of the climate in 10 thousand years, but in the next century. And neither Milankovitch cycles nor the Sun will make a difference for what's coming in the next several decades. - i am reading the IPCC reports and yet I get a much different picture than you. - true, the Little Ice Age had a massive social and political impact on European nations. - as someone who claims to have studied climate change and reviewed the literature, you seem pretty unaware of the real meaning of climate change and its consequences. The fact global temperatures increase 1 or 2 degrees from what they were in pre-industrial times does not mean that it's getting slightly warmer everywhere on the planet. That's complete nonsense from a climate science perspective. Temperatures are soaring in the Arctic, some other regions are cooling. But the most dire consequences don't come from changing temperatures directly but from shifting rain patterns, intensifying extreme weather events and rising sea levels, with all their particular ramifying consequences like emerging infactious diseases, pest invasions, decline in pollinating species, strains on our agricultural systems, and then, massive social and political destabilization.

It was warmer during the previous one as well, and the one before. This is thousands of years ago, not that long is it. - we're still in an ice age. The earth is not much warmer than its past. In fact its cooler. The trend over thousands/millions of years is DOWNWARD. -- temperatures are not increasing as predicted, they're much lower, and have strayed out of the projected values from CMIP5 (IPCC AR5 report projections) - there's no concrete evidence our world will be worse off with 2-3c of change in 100 years. if you dont believe me, feel free to read the IPCC reports. Its all in there with their caveats about how projections are not accurate, and how the impacts of climate are highly uncertain / unknown. I tell you what, I'd much prefer a warmer than colder world.

The evidence for this, from their motivations and their alliances, to their public relations campaigns and various other tactics like massive funding of sympathizing scientists, lobbyists, politicians and think tanks, is overwhelming and indisputable.

Maybe if you had an iota of intelligence you'd pause to consider someone might know better than you - especially if they have life long experience. I'm always amused at the ignorance of morons who think that people believed in a flat Earth - no one ever did! So actually the ignorant one is you! People have believed the Earth to be spherical (not round!) since the earliest recorded history! The Egptians, Greeks, Persians and Indians all came to that conclusion by different means ranging from astrology/astronomic observation to the study of the lengths of shadows cast at different locations. Also since the Bronze Age we had international trade between Africa, Asia and Europe so people knew such as far back as the ancient phenocians who sailed around africa from europe to asia that the world was a sphere. Greeks and Egyptians calculated the size of the world accurately and actually it was the fact that they knew how big the world was that deterred the Europeans from sailing to China by going West instead of East (boats could not carry enough supplies to last that length of ocean voyage). As far as the heliocentric model versus the geocentric model all of that has been mooted by Relativity. If you desribe the solar system from outside the system or from the sun then yes the planets do orbit around the sun but it's equally valid to state that to a stationary observer on the Earth to him the whole universe may appear to be revolving around him. As far as scientists perpetrating a scam of course there is a hugh motivation to do so because their living is from working on such projects. If they admitted there was no problem then the funding would be cut and they would be out of a job! At the moment we have globalist Marxist elites in the UN, EU and West using Hitler's climate/environment scam to create a tax on Carbon. CO2 is the stuff of life - everything in our civilisation depends on carbon (fossil fuels) and results in C02. Contrary to the 'green house gas' lies it does NOT actually have much effect on climate! We also find from ice samples in the poles that warming started before human industrialisation so the antropogentic cause has been throughly disproven. We also find that the Earth has many warming and cooling periods - for the majority of Earths history life flourished better at much warmer temperatures and it was actually cooling periods that caused reductions in life and extinctions! Back in the 1970s there was scare mongering that food would run scarce as plants and animals died out and humans population increased - there were even films like Soylent Green where people resorted to recycling dead people! In the 1980s there was acid rain, petrol running out, and hole in the Ozone Layer- the layer was depleting so the earth would warm, seas would melt and we would die of increased UV radiation. It turned out the hole was always there - the Ozone layer is not static but changes shape. The scientists on the global ozone monitoring project finally owned up and their funding cut back!

145,Ugy8KJeZjwVe1fCH57p4AaABAg,0.0,0,2019-11-07 22:09:03,Jason Melton,"According to the Vostok Ice Core Records, CO2 level changes have followed Earth&#39;s overall temperature changes at an 800 year lag for the last 800,000 years. That means that our current CO2 levels are the result of Earth&#39;s overall temperature 800 years ago. World leaders have convinced their dependents that this works in the reverse order, relatively quickly, and that we are to blame, so that they can tax us out of a false shared guilt in order to be able to afford to &quot;fight&quot; climate change, an unstoppable natural cycle. The following is the source of this information:<br /><br />Historical Carbon Dioxide Record from the Vostok Ice Core<br /><br />Investigators<br />J.-M. Barnola, D. Raynaud, C. Lorius<br />Laboratoire de Glaciologie et de Géophysique de l&#39;Environnement,<br />CNRS, BP96,<br />38402 Saint Martin d&#39;Heres Cedex, France<br /><br />N.I. Barkov<br />Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute,<br />Beringa Street 38, 199397,<br />St. Petersburg, Russia<br /><br />Period of Record<br />417,160 - 2,342 years BP<br /><br />Methods<br />In January 1998, the collaborative ice-drilling project between Russia, the United States, and France at the Russian Vostok station in East Antarctica yielded the deepest ice core ever recovered, reaching a depth of 3,623 m (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Ice cores are unique with their entrapped air inclusions enabling direct records of past changes in atmospheric trace-gas composition. Preliminary data indicate the Vostok ice-core record extends through four climate cycles, with ice slightly older than 400 kyr (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Because air bubbles do not close at the surface of the ice sheet but only near the firn-ice transition (that is, at ~90 m below the surface at Vostok), the air extracted from the ice is younger than the surrounding ice (Barnola et al. 1991). Using semiempirical models of densification applied to past Vostok climate conditions, Barnola et al. (1991) reported that the age difference between air and ice may be ~6000 years during the coldest periods instead of ~4000 years, as previously assumed. Ice samples were cut with a bandsaw in a cold room (at about -15°C) as close as possible to the center of the core in order to avoid surface contamination (Barnola et al. 1983). Gas extraction and measurements were performed with the &quot;Grenoble analytical setup,&quot; which involved crushing the ice sample (~40 g) under vacuum in a stainless-steel container without melting it, expanding the gas released during the crushing in a pre-evacuated sampling loop, and analyzing the CO2 concentrations by gas chromatography (Barnola et al. 1983). The analytical system, except for the stainless-steel container in which the ice was crushed, was calibrated for each ice sample measurement with a standard mixture of CO2 in nitrogen and oxygen. For further details on the experimental procedures and the dating of the successive ice layers at Vostok, see Barnola et al. (1987, 1991), Lorius et al. (1985), and Petit et al. (1999).<br /><br />Trends<br />There is a close correlation between Antarctic temperature and atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (Barnola et al. 1987). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows that the main trends of CO2 are similar for each glacial cycle. Major transitions from the lowest to the highest values are associated with glacial-interglacial transitions. During these transitions, the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 rises from 180 to 280-300 ppmv (Petit et al. 1999). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows the present-day levels of CO2 are unprecedented during the past 420 kyr. Pre-industrial Holocene levels (~280 ppmv) are found during all interglacials, with the highest values (~300 ppmv) found approximately 323 kyr BP. When the Vostok ice core data were compared with other ice core data (Delmas et al. 1980; Neftel et al. 1982) for the past 30,000 - 40,000 years, good agreement was found between the records: all show low CO2 values [~200 parts per million by volume (ppmv)] during the Last Glacial Maximum and increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations associated with the glacial-Holocene transition. According to Barnola et al. (1991) and Petit et al. (1999) these measurements indicate that, at the beginning of the deglaciations, the CO2 increase either was in phase or lagged by less than ~1000 years with respect to the Antarctic temperature, whereas it clearly lagged behind the temperature at the onset of the glaciations.<br /><br />References<br />Barnola, J.-M., D.

And why would anyone do this when the context of any comments on this subject (or almost any subject) is vitally important, and the context clearly includes the time when the comments were made? Having said that, I surmise the date must be late 2010 or 2011 and the situation has got far worse in the last eight or nine years. Prof Chomsky says that the situation (in 2011) is a danger to the survival of our species, but since then the Yanks have elected (sort of - lost the vote but won the office) a man who has never read a science book in his life but who still claims to know more about Global Warming and Climate Science than any so-called &#39;experts&#39;, and who has decided in his &#39;unmatched wisdom&#39; that the whole thing is a Chinese hoax. My grandchildren will be living in a dangerous and fearful world, where security can only be gained for a while by barbed wire fences and brutally inhuman deterrence measures (eg. sinking boats packed with desperate men, women and children who are fleeing war and starvation in Africa and Asia), where coastal and estuarine cities like the one I (and half the human race) live in will be struggling to find the resources to raise our flood defences higher and higher, and where obtaining enough food will be a constant worry. <br /><br />This is the world that we are bequeathing the younger generation, and there are, as Prof Chomsky correctly says, people who are driving this forward, even though they know what&#39;s coming (they&#39;re not all as ignorant as Trump or living in an alternative reality fantasy-world like his supporters). Sadly, the people who bear most responsibility for this looming disaster will be the last ones to suffer the consequences. The poorest and least culpable will die in their hundreds of millions while the wealthy retreat to higher ground and surround themselves with fences and armed guards, but their turn will come, because no-one will be immune from the kind of catastrophe we are bringing down on our civilisation.

330,UgxHzVAR7XCS0HgKVHd4AaABAg,0.0,1,2019-10-01 11:58:12,DAVID BADGLEY,"Concerning Dr. Chomsky&#39;s interview by David Barsamian, Truthout, published Aug 21, 2019. &quot;Chomsky: By Focusing on Russia, We Ignore Trump&#39;s Existential Threat to Climate&quot;.<br /><br /><br />Aside from Dr. Chomsky&#39;s very correct comments regarding the Democrat&#39;s obsession with the Russia narrative as well as other matters, is, Trump&#39;s threat to &quot;climate&quot;. I believe the doctor knows very well that what has morphed from &#39;global warming&#39; into &#39;climate change&#39; and &#39;extreme weather&#39; is a smoke screen for plans to regulate and tax the developed world through perfidy into funding and support for a transition to a one world socialist technocracy with the United Nations as it&#39;s unelected bureaucratic hub, and to negotiate a redistribution of the world&#39;s resources. He&#39;s choosing ideology over the truth on these issues and is turning a blind eye to a neo-Lysenkoism now perverting science that could threaten catastrophe to far more of those in the third world, as well as the developed world, than anyone can imagine and could cripple science for a generation or more if not forever given the very real possibility of a cultural collapse. The independent scientist who was one among the first to develop a &#39;global heating&#39; hypothesis, and his own &quot;Gaia&quot; theory, James Lovelock, has reversed his opinion saying &quot;I was wrong&quot; and now sees climate-change theory as more religion than science. He&#39;s had open distain for the IPCC &#39;cooking the books&#39; with their computer models. Even Al Gore&#39;s &quot;mentor&quot; on global warming, Dr. Roger Revelle, greatly modified his original claims of a &quot;greenhouse effect&quot; in an article in the then new science magazine COSMOS coauthored with Dr. Fred Singer. An article which drew unfounded and malicious criticisms and aspersions against Dr. Singer as having &quot;taken advantage of a frail old man&quot;, that is, Dr. Revelle, who, up until his death in 1991, exhibited no signs of a dementia. To add insult to injury Al Gore refused to accept an offer to debate his espoused &#39;mentor&#39; and anyone else going so far as to &#39;poison the well&#39; by echoing the slander that Dr Revelle had become senile. Gore then had the temerity to accept the &#39;Roger Revelle Award&#39; and a Nobel for his work in the promotion of this global warming alarmism. Dr. Chomsky has even been willing to throw the MIT expert in the field, Dr. Richard Lindzen, under the bus for the sake of ideology and the coming technocracy. I&#39;ve yet to hear him comment on the interview with Germany’s NZZ Online Sunday of the IPCC&#39;s economist Dr. Ottmar Edenhofer in which he said, &quot;First of all, developed countries have basically expropriated the atmosphere of the world community. But one must say clearly that we redistribute de facto the world’s wealth by climate policy. Obviously, the owners of coal and oil will not be enthusiastic about this. One has to free oneself from the illusion that international climate policy is environmental policy. This has almost nothing to do with the environmental policy anymore, with problems such as deforestation or the ozone hole.&quot; Even Saikat Chakrabarti, Rep. Ocasio-Cortez&#39;s former chief of staff, said as much recently regarding the &quot;green new deal&quot; (better called &quot;the green leap forward&quot;) and that it&#39;s main purpose was to restructure the American economy. I&#39;m a non-person with no credentials but I&#39;d be willing to debate Dr. Chomsky publicly on the issue, one on one or with a team and, for my team, I&#39;d choose Dr Richard Lindzen and either Dr. Patrick Moore, Lord Monckton, Dr. Willie Soon or Dr. Judith Curry, late of Georgia Tech and formerly associated with NOAA and NASA until she started to question their data which brought upon her derision and public slander. Such a David and Goliath match, though, will never take place. As to the claims and predictions of Dr. Chomsky and that of various groups and institutions he often cites, such as the IPCC as well as NOAA &amp; NASA, I&#39;ll refer to a quote Dr. Chomsky introduced me to from Wolfgang Pauli, &quot;That theory is worthless. It isn&#39;t even wrong!&quot;",UCpljq1MvXBcCL6MApnaZ9IQ,0,UgxHzVAR7XCS0HgKVHd4AaABAg,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

This reverses the glacier’s 20-year trend of thinning and retreating. But because of what else is happening on the ice sheet, and the overall climate outlook, that’s not necessarily a good thing for global sea level. That's because, despite the fact that this particular glacier is growing, the whole Greenland ice sheet is still losing lots and lots of ice. Jakobshavn drains only about seven percent of the entire ice sheet, so even if it were growing robustly, mass loss from the rest of the ice sheet would outweigh its slight expansion.'

The true nature of money is another big lie that even still today a significant large majority have yet to understand.<br />In the United States the income tax was never ratified by the required number of states. Another big lie. Rendering income tax illegal the IRS is illegal. The government is the largest organized crime syndicate the world has ever known. Which includes not just factions within the US government but around the world. This is real. They are not now or ever have bean operating as an honest representative of the people. They represent a very small percent. Clearly many have no idea the extent and depth of the Corruptions. <br />Keep searching.<br />Peace",UCmhQCKzHUVhyKAXW6BIxJIA,0,Ugx84GR9sqnMUaWJYbx4AaABAg,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

For someone who has admired you since I first became aware of you, it saddens me to see that you have fallen for the same lies as so many have on Climate Change. Interestingly, it was known as Global Warming until the deceiver alarmists changed the title because temperature is too easily measured! I thought you would have been astute enough to do your own research, which would have informed you of the truth regarding the Earth&#39;s climate. It&#39;s obvious you haven&#39;t, so I&#39;ll make it easy for you to catch up. Tony Heller has been exposing the deception in the climate alarmist lobby for some time, and this is a link to his website. <a href=""https://realclimatescience.com/"">https://realclimatescience.com/</a> I hope you have a look at Tony&#39;s website, although I&#39;m not at all confident you will, unfortunately. Since you are already 90 years old, it&#39;s unlikely you&#39;ll live long enough to see that the predictions you believe in are proven to be be false, as they most certainly will be. Many, many, in fact all of the predictions made by Al Gore and his fellow False Prophets for more than 10 years, have already been dis-proven, since they failed to materialize. The simple fact is that the Earth&#39;s climate is constantly changing, as it always has. About the only way humans could affect the climate is by having a global nuclear war, which would block out the sun long enough for all plant life to die, causing everything else to die as well! Carbon is the building block of all life on Earth, and the more CO2 the better, not worse! Do yourself a favor Noam, and do some research.

Let's look at one isolated example of predictions vs. reality.   Climate prediction: 'Similarly, Chris Lucas and colleagues (2007, 26) in a report for the Climate Institute of Australia argue that climate change can affect scenarios of wildfire weather in two ways. It can exacerbate the fire-weather risk of any given day, leading to increased frequency or intensity of extreme fire weather days. By increasing the accumulated fire risk over a year it can also result in longer fire seasons and a reduction in the number of days suitable for controlled burning. Their assessment of expected changes in Southeast Australia predicts all of these scenarios by 2050 when combining greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions scenarios and historical weather observations. Since 1950 rainfall has decreased, droughts have become more severe, and the number of extremely hot days has risen in south-east Australia (see also Henessy et al 2006). Southeast Australia is predicted to become even hotter and drier by 2050 with a substantial increase in wildfire risk and longer wildfire seasons that start earlier in the year that at present. Most change is expected in Northern South Wales [NSW], with little change in Tasmania, and smaller change in coastal areas in general compared to inland regions.' An excerpt from 'Gender and Wildfires: Landscapes of Uncertainty' published by Christine Eriksen in 2013. Reality check: 'The NSW statutory Bush Fire Danger Period normally begins on 1 October and continues through until 31 March. In 2019–20, the fire season started early with drought affecting 95 percent of the state and persistent dry and warm conditions across the state.'  https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-50951043 Account of a friend who's family went through the fire recently: 'But no matter how big the smoke plumes rose, we took comfort in stories of how the house had stood there for over a hundred years. It had never seen a bushfire. Many had come close in the past. But even as the calls to evacuate the area came in, we felt like we would be safe.  Even that morning, as temperatures across New South Wales began to rise above 40º C and winds began to howl at 60 km/h, we didn’t know how bad things could get. Then just after 10am, we received the call; “The farm’s on fire…I can’t get out.” In the end, the Currawan fire front swept through my grandfather’s farm on the last day of 2019, and burnt black what had been the lush-green, kangaroo-bound backdrop of my childhood. Twenty-six Angus cows died. Fourteen chicken. Countless endemic species gone. The house amazingly survived, but two neighbours’ houses didn’t.' http://climatetracker.org/australiafiresfamilyfarm/ Please actually read scientific literature, models and regional predictions and trends.",UCNpJA2ST0ru8EUolqNpdmzQ,1,Ugwv_BZqmlc3WOegjlJ4AaABAg,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

It can exacerbate the fire-weather risk of any given day, leading to increased frequency or intensity of extreme fire weather days. By increasing the accumulated fire risk over a year it can also result in longer fire seasons and a reduction in the number of days suitable for controlled burning. Their assessment of expected changes in Southeast Australia predicts all of these scenarios by 2050 when combining greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions scenarios and historical weather observations. Since 1950 rainfall has decreased, droughts have become more severe, and the number of extremely hot days has risen in south-east Australia (see also Henessy et al 2006). Southeast Australia is predicted to become even hotter and drier by 2050 with a substantial increase in wildfire risk and longer wildfire seasons that start earlier in the year that at present. Most change is expected in Northern South Wales [NSW], with little change in Tasmania, and smaller change in coastal areas in general compared to inland regions.' An excerpt from 'Gender and Wildfires: Landscapes of Uncertainty' published by Christine Eriksen in 2013. Reality check: 'The NSW statutory Bush Fire Danger Period normally begins on 1 October and continues through until 31 March. In 2019–20, the fire season started early with drought affecting 95 percent of the state and persistent dry and warm conditions across the state.'  https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-50951043 Account of a friend who's family went through the fire recently: 'But no matter how big the smoke plumes rose, we took comfort in stories of how the house had stood there for over a hundred years. It had never seen a bushfire. Many had come close in the past. But even as the calls to evacuate the area came in, we felt like we would be safe.  Even that morning, as temperatures across New South Wales began to rise above 40º C and winds began to howl at 60 km/h, we didn’t know how bad things could get. Then just after 10am, we received the call; “The farm’s on fire…I can’t get out.” In the end, the Currawan fire front swept through my grandfather’s farm on the last day of 2019, and burnt black what had been the lush-green, kangaroo-bound backdrop of my childhood. Twenty-six Angus cows died. Fourteen chicken. Countless endemic species gone. The house amazingly survived, but two neighbours’ houses didn’t.' http://climatetracker.org/australiafiresfamilyfarm/",UCNpJA2ST0ru8EUolqNpdmzQ,1,Ugxs4OaUU95VgXP9iuF4AaABAg,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

To heat it, even by a small amount, takes a staggering amount of energy. To heat it by a mere 1˚C, for example, an astonishing 6,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 joules of energy are required. Let’s put this amount of energy in perspective. If we all turned off all our appliances and went and lived in caves, and then devoted every coal, nuclear, gas, hydro, wind and solar power plant to just heating the ocean, it would take a breathtaking 32,000 years to heat the ocean by just this 1˚C! In short, our influence on our climate, even if we really tried, is miniscule! So it makes sense to ask the question – if the ocean were to be heated by ‘greenhouse warming’ of the atmosphere, how hot would the air have to get? If the entire ocean is heated by 1˚C, how much would the air have to be heated by to contain enough heat to do the job? Well, unfortunately for every ton of water there is only a kilogram of air. Taking into account the relative heat capacities and absolute masses, we arrive at the astonishing figure of 4,000˚C. That is, if we wanted to heat the entire ocean by 1˚C, and wanted to do it by heating the air above it, we’d have to heat the air to about 4,000˚C hotter than the water. And another problem is that air sits on top of water – how would hot air heat deep into the ocean? Even if the surface warmed, the warm water would just sit on top of the cold water. Thus, if the ocean were being heated by ‘greenhouse heating’ of the air, we would see a system with enormous thermal lag – for the ocean to be only slightly warmer, the land would have to be substantially warmer, and the air much, much warmer (to create the temperature gradient that would facilitate the transfer of heat from the air to the water). Therefore any measurable warmth in the ocean would be accompanied by a huge and obvious anomaly in the air temperatures, and we would not have to bother looking at ocean temperatures at all. So if the air doesn’t contain enough energy to heat the oceans or melt the ice caps, what does?",UCBpdYz03gMjvshiRWep8r9g,1,Ugxs4OaUU95VgXP9iuF4AaABAg,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

Explain to me how a rise of 1º C (that is not even near, its about 0.03º) on oceans can expand its water volume enough to create a rise on ocean levels. Remember that as an average, the ocean is at 40 atm of pressure (40 times more as surface pressure), so you will need to warm it up a lot to expand the oceans volume to a point that you see a rise on oceans level (according to gases laws)... Surface temperatures are all wrong mainly because termometers are within citys web, between ACs, shades, bridges, gardens, where the air temperature have much more variation than at, lets say, 10 meters from the ground, or 20 meters from the ground. And why is that when you compare solar radiation plots or graphs againts earth temperature variations, they seems almost the same, almost like a mirror and why all IPCC climate changes methods of calculation dont include solar radiation, neither cloud covering, even knowing that water vapor is the true mediator for planet temperature... the true ""greenhouse gas"". And the fact that Co2 is just a part of the 1% of gases in atmosphere. Why you still believe in BS said 20 years ago when you can see now. Why is that in plain summer the ships of climate change ""scientists"" got stucked on ice that was formed on an area where there was no ice and boats could cross? Media doesnt talk about that right?

There are far more Climate Experts who do not agree to the CO2 Theory, than mass media wants us to believe and it is not true, that they would all be payed by the oil industry or hate little girls. Searching a bit into the matter, it becomes obvious, that there is some kind of manilupation going on. Highly reputated scientist who were convinced of the CO2 Theory, left the IPCC after they had changed their mind - and they consider the IPCC to be a corrupt institution with a political agenda. The IPCC was founded by politics with a clear command, in order to proove the man made climate change. This itself is a totally unscientific approach. Please do not misunderstand me. I am absolutley convinced, that we do have to change our way of economics and we have to show far more minduflness regarding the consequences of our actions regarding nature, we should not allow pesticides etc. I love nature and I want us to act carefully regarding our biggest treasure and the variety of species. The pattern, that I get more and more convinced about is, that necessary protest is in modern times misguided by wrong information, by aims, that we don't know - this is designed by media agencies in order to manipulate public opinion. It has already been detected, that the management has in a hidden sphere, founded a labour union itself, in order to secretley direct the show etc. CO2 is the gas, that plants a breathing. Without CO2 there would be no life on earth. As a matter of fact 280 ppm, as in times before industrialisation, this was the lowest value in the history of the planet. Plants need CO2 and they transform it into sugar. Plant rest over the decades make oil and coal. And there the CO2 is all embedded inside. If the CO2 is down to 150 ppm - all live indeed would be dying. So what we are doing when we push CO2 back into the atmosphere - we are doing recycling. Actually plants are growing better with more CO2. People owning a greenhouse pump CO2 into the house in order to raise the share of CO2 up to 1000 ppm. More than that, we can be sure, that our planet and nature will be destroyed, trees will die and insecs too, when 5G will be implemented everywhere as it is planned. My concern is, that these protests come at the right time, to make us believe, it would be climate change and not this new sick technology, which will bring a patter of total life time control from the government over each single citizen.",UC4rO_oePpfsrIktFJYJxKeg,1,UgzX5TJEJ7UGokg9ErV4AaABAg,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

China is also by far the largest investor in clean energy in the world, and most of its emissions have to do with western companies moving their production to China for cheap labor. ""Climate scientists have produced results that they expect will give them the most funding."" All of them? All across the world in all the major scientific institutions, millions of scientists are all part of this conspiracy for more cash and somehow no reputable scientific institution has come forward with evidence disproving this supposed fraud? Do you really believe this is a reasonable belief to hold? ""Global Warming became Climate Change as the cooling became very evident."" There's no cooling, and if you're so certain there is, please give one reputable scientific source for this claim. Climate Change is a term used since the 1950s. The current prevalence of the term Climate Change is partially because climate scientists believe it better encompasses a wider rage of phenomena such as sea level rise, ocean acidification, shifts in flower/plant blooming, extreme weather events and the increase global mean temperatures (global warming). It's also become more prevalent because preferred by conservatives as it sounds less threatening than global warming and allows them to pull the cheap rhetorical trick of saying ""the climate has always changed"" to disregard the extremely rapid change in climate due to human activity. ""The liberals are nihilist and see GW or CC as a taxable route to the destruction of the West"" You are an absolute moron if you truly believe this. You are not describing real people, you are describing shitty comic book villains. What does anyone have to gain with the ""destruction of the West""? By contrast, fossil fuel companies have a lot gain from making you believe global warming is a hoax.

I know of three Nobel prize winners in Physics who cast doubt on climate change. Dyson is one of them but there are two others. I see no reason to doubt their honesty. Secondly much of the liberal talk about global warming concentrates on Republicans and Trump. But it is China which emits twice the CO2 which we do and which is building coal fired plants all over the world. Naturally Democrats ignore China because there is no political mileage in it. So the issue is more complex. To repeat I think we should take action on climate change but I also think that those who doubt it must be treated with respect and that we should focus our attention on China and not on the Republicans.,UCiaQ2PSj4bNnZlbLgexi5Mg,0,UgyAqnVOxzfnV2m6cu94AaABAg,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

This idea that one has to see the doctor regularly is nazi propaganda to prop up one of the biggest industries in the USA, the healthcare industry, whose material input is human beings. I&#39;ve lived in the USA since the 70&#39;s and I don&#39;t have a doctor. As a matter if fact, when I have had the need to see a doctor they&#39;re suspicious of me because I don&#39;t have a clinical record. I lived in New Zealand for a few years and exactly the same thing happen. They can&#39;t understand that health is earned, not bought. Seeing the doctor regularly does not makes us healthier, it just makes them richer. Mind you, richer in the sense that they now have more stuff and have to pay for it, hence they need more patients, more surgeries, more, more, more. And that&#39;s precisely why United Statians are so unhealthy. They have become supersized in more ways than one, and that&#39;s why they need to see the doctor regularly. And there are many unscrupulous doctors who will recommend you need what best for them, get the most money from you. When I run into one if those, I tell them I&#39;m trying to fix my problem, not theirs!

The idea that scientists are super honest, they&#39;re just about facts, data, observable phenomena is nice to believe, but a lot of them are politically motivated and just out right lie and misrepresent the data. <br /><br />We&#39;ve seen the temperatures go up and down over decades, thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of years. it&#39;s normal.

Sea ice has increased, however not because the region has experienced cooling. *The Southern ocean has been warming at an accelerating rate.* Sea ice gain has been attributed to the hole in the ozone layer above the Antarctic and global changes in ocean currents (Zhang 2007). What wealthy corporations do in the Maldives has no bearing on reality. What a weird attempt at evidence. The Great Barrier Reef has experienced extensive coral bleaching due to warming oceans (Hughes et al. 2018). *Can you find a single study that suggests it is not doing worse than previously due to warming waters?* Due to conservation efforts, some polar bear populations have experienced a temporary resurgence, however despite these efforts other populations are still experiencing climate-related decline. Due to ice loss, polar bear populations are expected to experience declines ranging from 30% to 80% in just three generations (Wilson et al. 2017; Regehr et al. 2016; Derocher et al. 2004). *Have you any studies that show that polar bear populations will remain stable or increase in the future?* Three populations are already in decline (http://pbsg.npolar.no/export/sites/pbsg/en/docs/status-table-2014.pdf).

Earlier this year, a fish that was caught just off the coast of the Fukushima prefecture was discovered to have 124 times the safe level of radioactive cesium. Back in 2012 the Vancouver Sun reported that cesium-137 was being discovered in a very high percentage of the fish that Japan was selling to Canada…<br /><br />• 73 percent of the mackerel<br /><br />• 91 percent of the halibut<br /><br />• 92 percent of the sardines<br /><br />• 93 percent of the tuna and eel<br /><br />• 94 percent of the cod and anchovies<br /><br />• 100 percent of the carp, seaweed, shark and monkfish<br /><br />So why was radiation testing for seafood subsequently shut down in Canada? Obviously crooked politician&#39;s was bought off.<br /><br /> Probably the same ones crying about CO2 and global warming as they flying around the world on their private jets and owning three houses like Dan Quayle and Obama.<br /><br />Telling people that they have to cut back. The old saying &quot;Do as I say not as I do&quot;. What a pack of corrupt hypocrites. <br /><br />But virtually nobody in the mainstream media considers this to be important enough to talk about. If you don&#39;t find that a little concerning I will be surprised. Stop and think how many people rely on the ocean for survival.<br /><br />The half-life of some of Plutonium 239 is 24,100 years so if you started out with 1 pound of plutonium 239 in 24,100 years you would be left with half a pound of plutonium 239. And in 48,200 years it should be gone. But there is also plutonium 244 which has a half-life of over 800 million years. So in other words it would take 1,600,000,000 billion years for plutonium 244 to disappear.<br /><br /> Humans appeared in Europe around 40,000 years ago.<br /><br /> But you see there&#39;s no money in it for politicians or very little so they are more than happy to ignore it. And how do you tell Europe and America that their citizens should foot the bill for cleaning up Japan&#39;s screwup for putting nuclear reactors in areas that are prone to tidal waves or tsunami&#39;s. <br /><br />It would be a tough sell. Even though it should be taken care of as quickly as possible instead of ignoring it. <br /><br />But here again the politicians and their friends would not be able to continually suck trillions of dollars out of taxpayers pockets to the end of time to fix this one screwup. Even though it would be the right thing to do, it&#39;s the least of their worries.<br /><br /> How many years did the legacy media avoid reporting anything to do with Fukushima? You know why General Electric sold those reactors to Japan and advise them on the installation. But you don&#39;t hear anything about that. Maybe because General Electric just happens to be one of the six investors of the legacy media. You see if you own the media you control what people see and listen to, whether it is true or false or just plain propaganda. <br /><br />Some scientist say the earth is going to cool half a degree for the next 50 years and then warm up 1°. So the people of the world are expected to hand over trillions of dollars for something that is a guess, to the crooked politicians that can&#39;t control or do a damn thing about.<br /><br /> One super volcano going off could put us into an ice age that would kill most living things on earth. And the odds of the super volcano going off is pretty good. Yellowstone is one of those super volcanoes that is past due. It could erupt tomorrow or in 300 years no one knows for sure. <br /><br />An ice age is far more dangerous than our climate warming 1° or 5° in 300 years. <br /><br />And the biggest concern is none of the above. We are far more likely to totally destroy the earth with a nuclear war. Because of the greedy warmongers that profit from war and large multinationals that want to steal the conquered countries resources.<br /><br /> How they don&#39;t understand making earth a radioactive waste land is a bad idea is beyond me. <br /><br />Just because the .001% thinks they can survive in their underground bunkers that was bought and paid for by the taxpayers. Half million years is a long time. And when you have that many deranged sociopaths together in their tunnels and underground bunkers, how long would it be till they turned on each other?",UCIx1xBZGLoJvIPP7dxIIBmg,0,Uggn2NfRmE8TL3gCoAEC,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

Like scared sheep they will do whatever these criminals tell them to. And the politicians know this.<br /> <br />Now for CO2 to be blamed solely on climate change is like believing in Santa Claus.<br /><br /> One volcano erupting can produce more CO2 than the industrialized world can create in a year. If you notice China and India are exempt till at least 2030 wonder why? Simply because they have lots of cheap or slave labor for the big multinational companies.<br /><br /> If you think about it, what is far more dangerous is all the chemicals and pollution the big multinationals dump into our environment that poisons our water and food supply.",UCIx1xBZGLoJvIPP7dxIIBmg,0,UghUZr3vG9_dQ3gCoAEC,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

I am not in a position to be certain that all ""alarmist"" scientists have not been caught intentionally manipulating and erasing data. If you are referring to the well known ""climategate"" then yes, I will deny such a thing was going on outright. Mann's hockey stick has been reconfirmed by multiple independent studies (just like evolution has). If you want an example of a climate alarmist who tells is it worse than it is, then there exist some examples of these morons. Guy McPherson is a classic example of this. You can look him up if you want. Islands are becoming submerged, though it is a slow process. Can islands grow at the same time there is sea level rise? (yes it can...no contradiction there). There are climate refugees already, you just don't recognize them as such. The war in Syria was made a lot worse from the drought. It is possible that that war would never have happened, had it not been for the human induced climate change which made that 950 years drought much more likely. All syrian refugees could easily be classified as climate refugees as such. There has been a drought in Central America as well (could be related); it is not clear how many is fair to attribute to climate change. Yes. James Hansen warned us 30 years ago. Problems aren't that big right now, but big problems are locked in for the future. It takes a loooooong time to feel the full impacts of climate change. We are barely starting to feel them now. A 30 years a head of time warning is fair when it takes 50 years to overhaul the energy system (wish we had started earlier). I was around 30 years ago when it started, but I was too young to understand then. You are the one being fooled. There are people and businesses that benefit from doubts about human caused climate change and I think you can calculate which industries benefit from these doubts.

A global network of 500 scientists and professionals has prepared this urgent message. Climate science should be less political, while climate policies should be more scientific. Scientists should openly address the uncertainties and exaggerations in their predictions of global warming, while politicians should dispassionately count the real benefits as well as the imagined costs of adaptation to global warming, and the real costs as well as the imagined benefits of mitigation. Natural as well as anthropogenic factors cause warming. The geological archive reveals that Earth’s climate has varied as long as the planet has existed, with natural cold and warm phases. The Little Ice Age ended as recently as 1850. Therefore, it is no surprise that we now are experiencing a period of warming. Only very few peer-reviewed papers even go so far as to say that recentwarming is chiefly anthropogenic. Warming is far slower than predicted. The world has warmed at less than half the originally-predicted rate, and at less than half the rate to be expected on the basis of net anthropogenic forcing and radiative imbalance. It tells us that we are far from understanding climate change. Climate policy relies on inadequate models Climate models have many shortcomings and are not remotely plausible as policy tools. Moreover, they most likely exaggerate the effect of greenhouse gases such as CO2. In addition, they ignore the fact that enriching the atmosphere with CO2 is beneficial. CO2 is plant food, the basis of all life on Earth. CO2 is not a pollutant. It is essential to all life on Earth. Photosynthesis is a blessing. More CO2 is beneficial for nature, greening the Earth: additional CO2 in the air has promoted growth in global plant biomass. It is also good for agriculture, increasing the yields of crops worldwide. Global warming has not increased natural disasters. There is no statistical evidence that global warming is intensifying hurricanes, floods, droughts and suchlike natural disasters, or making them more frequent. However, CO2 mitigation measures are as damaging as they are costly. For instance, wind turbines kill birds and insects, and palm-oil plantations destroy the biodiversity of the rainforests. Climate policy must respect scientific and economic realities There is no climate emergency. Therefore, there is no cause for panic and alarm. We strongly oppose the harmful and unrealistic net-zero CO2 policy proposed for 2050. If better approaches emerge, we will have ample time to reflect and adapt. The aim of international policy should be to provide reliable and affordable energy at all times, and throughout the world. https://youtu.be/GpVBH-HY5Ow https://clintel.nl/wp-content/uploads... https://www.youtube.com/redirect?html_redirect=1&q=https%3A%2F%2Fclintel.nl%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F09%2FED-brochureversieNWA4.pdf&v=GpVBH-HY5Ow&event=video_description&redir_token=Q-1_9DCOhTCuPIQBFPTa841_VaV8MTU3MTg4NjMzMUAxNTcxNzk5OTMx https://clintel.nl/prominent-scientists-warn-un-secretary-general-guterres/ Prominent scientists warn UN Secretary-General Guterres A group of 500 prominent scientists and professionals, led by the CLINTEL co-founder Guus Berkhout, has sent a registered letter to the Secretary-General of the UN, António Guterres. They warn the Secretary-General that “[c]urrent climate policies pointlessly and grievously undermine the economic system, putting lives at risk in countries denied access to affordable, reliable electrical energy.” They add: “We urge you to follow a climate policy based on sound science, realistic economics and genuine concern for those harmed by costly but unnecessary attempts at mitigation.” The European Climate Declaration sent as part of the letter to Guterres was drafted by climate ambassadors from 14 countries. The official presentation of the Declaration (including the release of the full list of signees) will be held in Oslo on October 18 during the Natural Variability and Tolerance conference.

For instance, if you build 300 MW of wind turbine nameplate &quot;capacity&quot;, it will in a very good site provide you with 24x365x100 MW.hours (that&#39;s 876 GWh) in a non leap year. If you wish to capture and use all of that &quot;free&quot; energy, you had better have 300 MW of gas turbine capacity to back it up, and by running the gas turbines with as much reserve capacity, at all times, as the power the wind is providing, you can guarantee that the grid will not collapse when the wind drops.<br />The USA has known, since before the Chernobyl meltdown, two reactor technologies that are idiot-proof meltdown immune, and at least one of them capable of converting all of the long-lived portion od &quot;spent&quot; nuclear fuel into very small quantities of short lived fission products.<br />Liberals have a justifiable horror of nuclear weapons, and in the USA perhaps a sense of guilt justifiable not so much by the bombing of Hiro-shima, as the bombing of Nagasaki a mere three days later. But they are plain bloody wrong to attach that horror to nuclear civilian power. It is environmentally cleaner than the almost equally reliable hydro power, and far safer per MWh of energy delivered in response to demand than any other technology. <br />Top nuclear weapons experts assert that a bomb could be designed using reactor waste, no such bombs have ever been attempted by &quot;rogue&quot; groups, because anybody with that knowledge knows that it is easier to build an atomic pile with very pure graphite and uranium, running it for short exposure times, and chemically extracting the plutonium before it absorbs enough neutrons to be less than bomb grade.

This value is overly liberal; the real value is much smaller.<br />Annual natural CO2 emissions = 800 Gt<br />Annual net atmospheric CO2 increase = 12 Gt (+1.5ppmv)<br /><br />These figures mean nature is currently sinking 98.5% of all CO2 emissions each year.<br /><br />Therefore, net human CO2 emissions (after natural sinking) = 0.45 Gt<br /><br />Thus, a reasonable (conservative) simplified estimate of the impact of human CO2 emissions is <br /><br />0.45/3200 x 1.65 = +0.00023C/year<br /><br />At this rate, it would take about 10,000 years of current human fossil fuel consumption rates to produce a measurable impact on mean global temperature.

If that amount of difference could freeze the planet then the same amount of difference towards warming - well, do you think it might affect the planet in an equally catastrophic way? The planet has warmed 5 deg celsius in the past and more than once and it has taken 5,000 years to do so but before humans had evolved so climate change has never affected human life but we’re about to find out for the first time how humans will be affected by global warming - and we’re not going to like it. Over the last century the increase in global temperature has occurred 10 times faster than pre-industrial times and the predicted rate of warming over the next century will occur 20 times faster than pre-industrial times. Our capitalist system demands endless growth to maintain itself. If growth is 3% per year then it will only take 30 years for energy use to double. Our economy, our wealth, is based on oil. Trillions of dollars! A lot of powerful interests have a lot to lose and they won’t just give it away because they don’t care about us, they don’t have to care about us because they are the ones who will ensure that they will survive! The 1% will use their wealth and power to find a way to survive through this. If there is any conspiracy going on here, it’s not a plot by international marxism to enslave us (newsflash - marxism died a long time ago. China is a capitalist system - just like us they are a one party system whereby no matter who is the leader the system stays the same, they just don’t pretend otherwise. It’s more honest to be upfront about these things don’t you think). The only conspiracy going on is the same as its always been, that of the 1% against the 99% but this time the consequences will be deadly for the 99%.",UCuZT7DsqDe1zSfBJl_3KCWg,1,Ughl-HE0rJRHi3gCoAEC,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

Hansen sees climate politics as “alligator shoe” lobbyists bribing the system.

It sells to those with a socialist leaning, but it doesn't sell on the actual market place of the global economy or history. Socialism is by all estimates, a declining philosphy, and yet Mr. Chomsky clings to its brittle, desiccated and obsolescent premises as if they are axiomatic. 3. ""Trump’s divisive rhetoric on immigrants and Muslims"" Mr. Trump's rhetoric on ""immigrants"" can be summed up in one quote of him ""Many of them are great people . . . but they are illegal."" The issue of Muslims is a more complicated one, but Trumps position on this topic appears to be a similarly pragmatic one. Mr. Chomsky makes a habit of closing his remarks with comments such as ""it’s up to us to defend and protect the rights of freedom of speech and association, insisting “everybody should be saying things like this."" In sum, he reneges on his commitments, he says one thing and does another: he tells his audience to think critically, to ask questions, and to remain skeptical, and then he provides completely self-contained ""explanations"" for all of the ills of society, phrased not as hypotheses or points for inquiry, but as pronouncements of dogma. He is the essence of all that is wrong with ""progressivism"" and more broadly what ails the Western House of Intellect and post-secondary education. The world will be far better when the old man has gone quiet for eternity.",UCIjjkl7izedOlnqzd7tVcgQ,1,Ugiiw0m-jne3tHgCoAEC,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

On youtube and for $2.99 from a half dozen streaming sources. Hardly hidden. I'm watching that clip about sea levels rising now. And...yes, he does provide a source. Not a very helpful one, but it's right at the beginning: Tony Blair's science advisor. Okay...not a peer reviewed study but it's at least a source so we know where he's coming from. He's not saying ""In such and such a study"". He's saying ""a political science advisor provide me with this info"". So he's not pretending. I would certainly agree that he is not giving his audience a good reason to believe what he's saying is true. But he's giving us an opportunity. Now I'm listening carefully at his claim. It's specific to a big ""if"" : 1/2 antartica or greenland ice melting. Likelihood of that happening? He does not say, at least in this clip. He just says ""if"". Looking quickly on google I also do see some corroboration for that particular ""if"" scenario. OK..so...my take on it is that in this particular part of the speech Gore is trying to get people to believe stuff for bad reasons, or at least be so scared that they look into it more. And I absolutely agree we should fault him for this argument, specific to the degree it's inaccurate or misleading. Absolutely. But...how exactly does that *compel* people to believe ""global warming is therefore a hoax?"" Are you saying that it awakened an anti-global warming movement of people willing to ignore the science because...supposedly he did when trying to argue for it? I mean... I understand the social phenomena of backlash, but that reminds me of the old ""if somebody jumps off a bridge..."" adage. I strongly suspect people were looking for a Gore to throw darts at and demonize, and he was a meaty target for all kinds of reasons. There's a ruthless misinformation campaign out there that focusses on far more than Gore...it seeks to smear the entire establishment of peer reviewed science. I just don't understand pinning that behavior on Gore, as if he caused people to abandon reason. Seems like a very odd, extremely tenuous causal claim-- a big fat ""he made me do it"" kindof excuse that kids give when caught red handed. In that scenario, whoever plays politics better wins regardless of the truth. So I just can't argue it's a good idea for anybody to advocate for that game. IMO it does nobody any good, even if one side thinks they are winning. We seem to agree on that. My whole position is that the right thing to do when somebody says something dubious is to find out what the truth is, not believe the opposite with even more irrational passion. If that's all we did where would it end and what good would science be to us anyways? There's some buddhism to it I guess. If you engage in any way by reacting for or against you feed it and lose yourself. Disinterest in the politics dispels the bullshit, and really helps keep the eye on the ball. If somebody walked away from Gore's speech with that reaction I would not fault Gore. That's a mistake he certainly did not help them make. They just aren't employing sound critical thinking skills. Especially if they are willing to jump on some other, even more demonstrably false bandwagon just to serve some emotional need to stick it to whoever they perceive to be 'the man'.",UC1chos6hM_ZBwHzLjQd3IBQ,1,UgijlcZuaRxosngCoAEC,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

This is the sort of conversation, that might be made by two non climate scientists, in a coffee shop. There is no science being quoted here either. But what I'm trying to explain to readers, is if you want to understand the issue, you have to go to the science. If you are not going to read the actual science in peer reviewed papers. It becomes even more essential, that any article you do trust that interprets and gives an opinion on the issue, has to have a source that is traceable back to a peer reviewed science journal. Analogy: You wouldn't trust a non doctor or chemist, if he came up with his own test, that no hospital uses, then tells you, you have cancer. But just like the AGW debate, you might be inclined to believe him if he says that you don't (we are all susceptible to information we want to hear). Generally, we trust the health professionals, and don't tend to listen to the snake oil vendors. Why can't people do that on the issue of climate science? Here is a hint...

Yes, that would be peer reviewed science. Climate deniers, too. The onus is on the individual thinker to try to come up with the best understanding they can, and to assess the veracity of somebody else's argument critically. I place the responsibility on each of us. Gore, too. He's not responsible for my thoughts. He's responsible for his, and I'm responsible for my thoughts about his. And everybody in his audience is responsible for their thoughts about his. I never thought Gore was just trying to deliver science. He's trying to frame and popularize a political/social/moral issue, which is really more of a political act overall IMO. A difficult and dirty business but certainly not inherently pointless or evil. It's totally fair game in my opinion to discuss not just scientific knowledge but possible sociopolitical ramifications. He may very well have idiotic views on the sociopolitical ramifications but that's not the charge you are leveling. It sounds to me as if the controversy you are describing is about whether his scientific sources even exist. His talk is supposedly based on knowledge derived from a scientific process for which there are sources. So...when you say he's not even pretending to be scientific I guess I agree in the sense that he's not writing his own peer reviewed paper. Of course not. But when you imply that there are no references to his slideshow which we can all go look at, for actual peer reviewed science....well... we can. We can do that fairly easily, and get a pretty good understanding of where he's being overly dramatic and where the scientific consensus actually is vs where he says, etc. Not only is it easy, but he's not referencing fake science or hiding his sources at all. So you seem to want to blame him for not being ONLY scientific, even though you could at any point in time research the information yourself easily. Misplaced responsibilities IMO.

To do that is politics, where so many people's critical thinking swoons and they give up veracity as a standard when they feel the least bit challenged. The GW topic is rife with that kind of tit-for-tat bullshit drama. And, frankly, criticizing Gore as supposedly a root cause for climate change denial is not just tenuous causation, it's of virtually no use unless your point is to take a side naively and perpetuate the drama. Again...a distraction. It's not wrong to use safe entry methods because some dope said something untrue about them.

The thing is, you can get away with saying all sorts of ridiculous things, if it is deemed to be for the good of all. But the confined spaces one is obvious (the guys just an idiot). Climate science requires far more work than the average person is willing, or has the time to do. So this is an good example, of what happens, when you allow an idiot, to say ridiculous things, when the answer is not so obvious. To add insult to injury, Al Gores video, 'An Inconvenient Truth', was multi award winning. Probably just because it was giving voice to the issue, but in the long run was very damaging to it. I think Nobel's prize should have gone to someone who used science in their production. So the Nobel judges also seem to bow to politics? It is not a good idea to allow people to say stupid things, because it is seen to be in the public interest. It is far more important to be correct on any issue.

His success or failure politically is not a measure of veracity. Politics is a different subject that does't employ veracity as a criteria for success, even if it pretends to sometimes. The measure of politics is a kind of amoral pragmatism: is it effective or not.

For whatever reason cynicism and contrarianism are too often mistaken for the practical work of critical inquiry. We live in a time where people use easy access to information (or just social media) to pick the truth they prefer rather than think skeptically and critically about arguments, evidence and sources. Everybody is trying to defend their comfort zones. Everybody thinks they are the victim. This kind of existential frustration seems to have the effect of fortifying bad ideas to defend against the more obviously worse ideas, and so everything spirals downhill. The fact that Chomsky is smart, appears to be a brave contrarian willing to say unpopular things, uses loads upon loads of sources, and often says things that can be confirmed to be true, has nothing at all to do with the veracity or soundness of his arguments, and certainly is not a reason to defer to his conclusions without really understanding them or looking at them carefully. Don't get me wrong, Chomsky is probably right about a great many things. But that doesn't mean he can't be wrong...even extraordinarily wrong. Chomsky fans often (in my experience) bristle at the very idea that something he says might be fairly easily demonstrated to be incorrect. In my opinion, you can't really value Chomsky's good ideas if you can't accept that some of his ideas are just not as good, or even bad. I think the same goes for Al Gore, in reverse in this particular discussion. Just because he's wrong doesn't mean he can't be right.

I would point out that regardless of where funding comes from, there is still a scientific process with useful degrees of integrity that produces results we can trust, if we don't get too distracted by the politics. We can still look at those results, and sift out the political baloney that has nothing, or very little, to do with the actual science. Because the real impact of politics seems to me to be less about funding and more about how politically warped the presentation of results has become. In my experience, funding sources can dramatically influence what kind of questions are getting asked, but ultimately have little impact over the soundness of the findings when scientific works are considered broadly, across multiple studies, multiple attempts at falsification, repeatability, etc. It's really in the way politicians and news sources report on, and lie about, the findings that the politicization has the most negative impact. The most common technique is to pretend there is *scientific* integrity to the *political* act of selectively raising the standing of the scientists or studies that best help their political goal. Abstinence only education is a good example of that. There was a concerted political effort to fund studies into abstinence only education, no doubt in the hopes that those studies would reveal successes that would justify expanding such eduction. So political forces dramatically limited some studies and pushed others. But the result was not a new *scientific* consensus on the virtues of abstinence only eduction. It just gave us a lot of information, and a better understanding, of this technique that ultimately was found not to be successful. It also gave more ammunition to cherry pickers-- There were studies that showed that in specific, narrow ways abstinence eduction worked. But more importantly, the ""only"" modifier did not, and as a whole the science confirmed that it's more of a value-issue than a scientifically-backed, pragmatic solution to STDs and pregnancy. It gave some ammunition to cherry picking politicians, but it didn't erase the fact that the science is still there, regardless of the filters that political discourse places on it. A politician or news source can spin anything to mean anything. But there remained integrity to the science itself. I think the same can be said of warming, and man-made impact. We should be looking at the science. Not what the politicians say, not one study, not one talking head, but as much as possible the science itself, and the specifics that make the science useful in determining truth. Sure, stay skeptical of funding sources, but only in as much as we can demonstrate that it actually affects the science. If we can't demonstrate that, then it's just another political distraction. I think you're putting too much emphasis on it, and creating an impression that if there are equal levels of politicization there is equal merit to each side scientifically, or at least equal levels of political corruption of the process. It might be useful to consider the difference between something having political repercussions vs. being inherently political. From the outside (of the science itself) anything with political repercussions, like climate science, or evolutionary biology, or sex-ed studies, can appear to be inherently political or politically driven when in fact it consists of a vast body of apolitical, evidence-based knowledge. It's useful to blur this distinction when the science isn't on your side--try to spin the narrative that there is no science that is not corrupted by political motives. So any political act that makes use of the actual science appears to taint the science, and makes it appear to be on the same playing field as bad science, or pseudo-science. It's an elementary fallacy, but still very effective in the political arena. Intelligent Design advocates employ the same methods.",UC1chos6hM_ZBwHzLjQd3IBQ,1,UgijlcZuaRxosngCoAEC,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

You need to realize: This is a highly political issue. It takes governments to solve it if it is true, even if people like Al Gore already weren't making exaggerated claims. My point being, every time the government informs the public, that there is some very large, looming, imminent threat, that demands immediate action, especially if it's only them who can save it from happening: it's normally a smoke screen where the people lose power personal liberties or money. Global warming smells of the power and money issues. Anyone who is worried about global warming needs to address these issues. If the planet ends up in some starving ball of fire, I say blame the politicians for being less trustworthy than a ten year old child. The first thing you need to help people like me believe you, is don't let them be your spokespersons. It's as bad, that most of these scientists are all funded by the government, as the naysayers being funded by big oil. We all know the government is not some benevolent institution that just does everything for the people. Just like big oil, they are running their own empire. So on top of all the other gripes in my posts (it smells wrong etc), this is a big problem in your game. EDIT: I've changed my stance on global warming. I am no longer a denier. My suspicions were reversed, upon the realization that the warming extremists were no more supported by scientific fact, as the nay sayers. Richard Lindzen is only 1 of 4 climate scientists in the world who deny man made global warming. He is believed to be under the pay of big oil through places such as the heartland institute. Al Gore is a major player on the yes side. He doesn't back any of his scary claims with science either. The extremists from both sides are creating problems on this issue. The only way to know is to go to the scientific papers published in the peer reviewed scientific journals.

I was evacuated in a town where the levy bank was bulldozed to save another more sensitive area. This town had never flooded before. The house I was in was rented as I was away for seasonal work. So most of my personal expense was the loss of my most expensive belongings, that I placed on high places around the house, that were stolen and broken, when the rescue volunteers came in after the floods, broke down the front door and threw them into piles in the street. They were able to do this in the time before we were allowed back in. None of this could have occurred without the benefits of modern planning. I'm almost as old as you (so I must be a senile old winger right?). But my memory of the weather goes more like this: The radio reports this is the hottest day since 1915. My point being, there was always a hotter day, 30 to 90 years ago. That was supposed to be the big thing (the gap in years). Then the narrative started to step it up, it became that, on average we are having more of these hotter days, even though it was hotter in 1915. Since the global warming came in, you hear, this was the hottest day ever. The previous hottest day in 1915 (or 19 whatever), has completely vanished. I was during these times, an outside worker.

Richard Lindzen is one they have successfully smeared. Enough so, that I am a global warming skeptic, who will not quote him as evidence. Chomsky and Lindzen have been in MIT for over 30years but never seem to refer to each other. This is just a little anecdotal evidence as to why I don't trust Lindzen. Nothing scientific about that. But the extremists, control all the data and information. You cannot have a conversation on a factual basis with them. You will notice that although he is a very anti establishment speaker, there are no sites listing Chomsky to any big tobacco or oil companies. This is because he is pro man made global warming. Chomsky is a great intellect and his pro warming stance is the only thing I've ever found exception to in his talks. So without science, or some other quantifiable fact, why am I anti man made global warming? These are two posts I've left on other sites. The 1st is in answer to why are the alarmists so stupid? 1. ""What's stupid about it? It falls into line with western world political best practice. It provides the people in government with a massive problem that only they are in a position to fix. For members of the science fraternity that are willing to blur their results, it pays them with $4.7 billion dollars funding for global warming works in the US alone. This is not stupid, it is unscientific, but it is the way they have chosen to play the game. The attitude, waste of money and level of deceit towards the people is what I take offense too."" 2. ""As I said before, I smell a rat. This is why the pro global warming community is starting to fail world wide. About 4 years ago the Mekong river was slightly overflowing into Pnom Pehn. The next year when it was at the lowest level I've ever seen it, half the people on the evening boat cruise I went on, were specialists in their various fields, to study the effects of Global warming. I've never seen any scientists before or since in this area. Why only when the river was at it's lowest and not to study the impacts of the flood? I know this argument is not scientific. But people the world over are starting to see things, they don't understand why exactly, but their instincts tell them, this isn't right.That is why the global warming alarmists are losing traction."" My reasons for being a skeptic of global warming are highly unscientific, and just based upon, many examples of the above I've seen in my own life.

But understand that the government is corrupt and the deregulations occured due to backroom deals. Ever wonder why the Clintons recieve so much $$ from Wall St. and their stock portfolios have shown overnight 100 fold increases? You mention Norway's oil control. How much do Norwegians pay in taxes? 40% income and 25% sales. And gas? Well so much for state run oil being efficient. The global average for a gallon of gas is $5.52. Norway it's a whopping $10.76 compared to the US at $3,52.. Also do a little research on Norways econmey. GDP was in negative digits last year. And you praise Norways control of oil but turn a blind eye to Venezuela's govt control of oil. More oil than Saudi Arabia yet the people are hunting for cats and dogs to eat. The problem in the US is that special interest are allowed to lobby (bribe) the govt to deregulate. You mention the good ol days in the US when there were tighter restrictions. Regulations on lobbying were lifted slowly starting in the 1980's and have since increase to the point where the govt is for sale to the highest bidder. So the problem really isn't private corporations but bloated corrupt government. The reason why healthcare sucks so bad in the US is because of lobbying from Insurance companies and big Pharma.. But as bad as it is Canadians come to the US in the 10's of 1000's every year for emergency medical care because Canadas state run healthcare system, while free, is inefficient.

The entire debate of state run vs private is a red herring. We need well run enterprises which consider externalities in their operation. Privately run businesses often fail to do this, even deliberately maximizing externalities, and then reporting these as ""profits"". Much of what appears to be failure of government to manage resources well is in fact government managing resources on behalf of corporate interests instead of on behalf of the public interest, The classic example that I have seen in my lifetime is the management of the incredible wealth BC has in its coastal old growth forest, which could have easily been managed to yield full hi wage employment for all the people in the area indefinitely. The people actively demanded that government manage the forests in this way, but the big corporate logging interest paid the government to allow them to manage the forest in such a way as to destroy much of the fishing resource, as well as practically destroy the entire forest in a generation. In other words, when government is captured by corporate interests, it is not ""government management"" that is to blame, but the fact government has become an agent of private corporate interest. The best contrasting example is the management of Norway's oil resource, Norway has a transparent democracy which precludes government acting as an agent of private corporate interests, and treats the public interest with the same fiduciary care we would expect from a private enterprise, except it looks at externalities as a cost rather than profit. If management of the oil resource threatened to destroy the Norwegian fisheries, the government would not allow this, or at a minimum would consider the cost to the fisheries as part of the equation. Norway has put nearly a trillion dollars into a fund which now allows Norway a degree of financial security that no amount of private management of the resource could have achieved, and has done very little damage to other sectors of the economy. The public health systems of many countries are far better than the private system in the US, public ownership and control of utilities gave us stable, economic energy for decades. California deregulated and privatized utilities and within a couple of years there were rolling blackouts, huge spikes in costs, massive profits for the criminals at ENron and no perceivable benefits except to the few with the ability to manipulate the prices. There are plenty of examples of poorly managed government enterprises as well as many poorly managed private enterprises- such as nearly every major US bank prior to 2008. WHen banking was tightly controlled by the government (if not owned) there was nearly 50 years without a major failure. Within a few years of the deregulation of the sector, failures began, and they increased until the near total collapse in 2008. The US government tightly managed the entire economy during WWII and produced almost unbelievable increases in production which swamped the axis in war material of every description. ENgland did the same with similiar results.",UCBFRD9sYLqSXARj-Z4dtOYA,1,UggzBpOdXo2eFngCoAEC,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

Freedom of choice is what you have in America. Any communist or socialist country or institution you have no choice. Thereby you are forced to consume what is offered. Good or bad.

Almost every sentence is red herring, a logical fallacy or some other intellectually dishonest and analytically flawed device. First, there are many political fights, and the one that you hase chosen to obsess on is no more ""real"" than the rich/poor, democratic/autocratic, socialist/oligarchic political fights.Second, Chomsky IS a scientist. He is the preeminent scientist in his field, and a Institute Professor Emeritus which is the highest academic teaching title at one of the world's most renowned scientific research school's --MIT. To be granted this title, one must be considered by peers to be among the most esteemed and accomplished scientific researchers. Chomsky has actually helped found a couple of fields of science himself. He is the leading figure in modern linguistics, cognitive science, political science as well as a historian and an analytic philosopher. He brings the scientific method to all his endeavours, and relies on evidence where others have relied on propaganda. He is the world's most authoritative expert on propaganda and its effect on language and culture. He actually is NOT a translator, and you would NOT call him to translate a language, that is not what linguistics is for. You could not be more misinformed about Chomsky. Corporatism is the belief that the right agents to regulate the economy and direct government are corporations- who are not people, they are legal fictions. Their profits are distributed to people, but they are legal fictions designed to redistribute wealth from workers to investors, and to externalize costs to the maximum extent possible.. Currently the corporations give us a thin veneer of democracy, where we can choose which corporate servant runs things in the corporate interest.. The 1% with very few exceptions fight vigorously against the expansion of social programs, and vigorously for tax cuts for themselves, but tax hikes for everyone else. They also pay off politicians and think tanks to demonize and conflate democratic socialism, with Stalinism or Bolshevism. They do this to create useful idiots who will vote against their own interests, like the moron on twitter who was celebrating the repeal of Obamacare because he was insured thru the affordable care act! I think he was certain he was well informed on the issue- no doubt from fox news- but he had no idea he was cheering for the abolition of his health coverage. Alex Jones has become a corporatist agent in recent years, confusing idiots with his incoherent nonsense about the UN and agenda 21, marxism, the Rothschilds and the ""new world order"" without supporting the few politicians like Bernie Sanders who actually are against the corporate global takeover that is well underway.. The UN TOTAL budget is about 5 billion last year. Exxon alone, made profits of 14 billion in 2015- where do you think the money and power are- being a UN climate scientist? or working for an Exxon funded think tank?? I am not one of the left wing nuts who want to stop all business, of who resent people who make money- I want everyone who works hard and has good ideas to make lots of money, and I want to see business thrive and create wealth. There is no reason not to do this AND protect the environment, in fact a green economy is the economic opportunity of our dreams.. AS for the Original argument, the question is not how much we cause climate change, it is how dangerous are the trends we are seeing, and what can we do to mitigate these trends if dangerous. If we had an asteroid heading for ELE impact on earth, we would try to deflect it, not argue over who sent it. We know from various core samples that CO2 levels correlate with temperature change, and we know CO2 is steadily rising, and passing above any levels seen since humans evolved. We also know we are pouring vast amounts of CO 2 into the atmosphere, and that the polar ice cap reflect large amounts of heat back into space, and that this cap is disappearing- fast. None of this is contentious, it has already happened, or is happening, no one disputes it. There are plenty of other reasons to move to renewable energy- like we would not need to socialize the cost of big oil's conquest of the middle East with multi-trillion dollar wars that could have funded the transition to alternative power, as well as other environmental benefits. We probably SHOULD build large tidal dams, and likely will HAVE to, just to deal with the current effects of global warming, and while we are at it, tidal generating stations that could provide most of the world's population with virtually free and limitless energy. But let's not add that, because that would undermine our ""industrial society"" in other words big oil's profits.You are obviously not a moron, and I apoligize for that comment, but I suspect you are plugged into soources of information which are concocted by think tanks to protect the interests of the global elite- who are the CEO's and top stock owners of the worlds largest corporations, not 2-bit bearaucrats at the UN with no real power, and no money behind them.. Exxon pays the think tanks with names like ""heritage"" and ""conservative"" to figure out how to convince people not to take the rational steps that prudence suggest, even tho they know from their own internal documents that GW is real, and that there is going to be a large cost associated with it. But they will not have to pay for it, and they get keep all the profits from contributing to it , so it makes sense for them to prevent us from doing anything which would change society over to other energy sources.",UCBFRD9sYLqSXARj-Z4dtOYA,1,UggzBpOdXo2eFngCoAEC,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

Unfortunately if you read 100s of books supporting your liberal view you will tend to support liberal views. Actually scientists including the founder of Green Peace and a Nobel Prize winning scientist have come out and stated Climate Change is a Hoax and even if it was real the supposed Warming is supposedly only .08 degrees. In fact if we look at the temperatures going back 1 million years we find the earth has actually cooled. The other fact is Carbon Dioxide is only a small part (Fraction) of the elements that make up weather. One important aspect of weather is the Sun and thats not even part of the equation. The earth goes through changes, another fact these changes have been even more dramatic in the past prior to the industrial revolution. <br /><br />Even if we assume Climate Change is real how will a Carbon Tax Scheme created by Enron going to help. Also, the supposed change in temperature if we do everything the IPCC wants is hardly enough to make any difference.<br /><br />The true agenda is World Government and a World Tax, this tax (Carbon Tax) is how they will fund this World Government. <br /><br />There is no Consensus among actual scientists. Just recently one scientist came out with a paper saying we are heading for another mini ice age. The polar ice is actually growing again and a research ship that went there to study the ice caps is stuck because of it. Unfortunately their scheme is falling apart everyday, but instead of admitting they might be wrong they are doubling down and now even wants to arrest people who deny it. Because its not about the Climate its about control.<br /><br />If you believe that there is a problem, how is Government going to help?

I just do not believe a Carbon Tax is the answer. One example of stupidity is Ethanol, ethanol actually produces more carbon than gasoline. The prevailing wisdom is because it is grown and not extracted it offsets the supposed damage it will cause from carbon emissions. Wind Power is another example, it would take thousands of acres of wind turbines to replace one Clean Coal Power Plant, at all times at least one Wind Turbine needs to powered from the grid in order to power the other turbines. At the same time the wind turbines are producing power the power plants are also running because wind power is unreliable and inconsistent. So nothing was actually gained except wasted money. Australia one of the first countries to introduce carbon taxes are now repealing them and are now claiming it is a UN Scam. Another fact, because of ethanol subsidies food prices have increased around the world. I believe the technology exists to replace fossil fuels, but the current alternatives are wasted money that could be directed towards other pressing concerns like Water Quality, Pollution, Cleaning the Ocean, etc. If you think taxing people is the answer than you are the idiot. No where in the Carbon Tax Scheme and the UN Agenda 21 Scheme did i read or hear about how they would use the money to actually do anything to clean up the earth. Its just another Corporate Scam.

Well I can see that I am not dealing with a genuine skeptic here, or anyone knowledgable about the basic practice or civilities of science. At the risk of repeating myself: In 1981, at a time when the northern hemisphere was cooling and the global mean temperature still below the values of the early 1940s, Hansen et al produced a model using a model based on only 3 forcings, solar volcanoes and CO2. They predicted a rise in temperature due to increasing CO2 would become apparent above the natural variations later that decade. The prediction was correct and has stood the test of time. http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2012/04/evaluating-a-1981-temperature-projection/ Over the decades, as more data and a better understanding of the factors affecting climate became known, the IPCC fifth report showed that the models have been highly successful. See Fig 9.8 page 768 here: http://www.climatechange2013.org/images/report/WG1AR5_Chapter09_FINAL.pdf The data in that report is up to 2012. Here is a plot updated with data to 2016. http://www.climate-lab-book.ac.uk/comparing-cmip5-observations/ These models do not include contributions due to multidecadal oscillations like the Atlantic meridional and Pacific decadal oscillations, (AMO and PDO) which were not fully appreciated at the time.

Bolsanaro only win because Lula was jailed for corruption which is BS since that is 99% of politicians in the world so you know if one gets arrested for it then they offended someone with a lot of money and influence. Also, how do you have any proof that when people get excited about crises that they are less likely to be skeptical of the government, if you look all over the world then the opposite is true. Countries that undergo massive crises have lots of resistance and there have been plenty of massive protests recently, especially in countries with high economic inequality (which is what the wealthy of the world want for the most part). Also, there is very little proof that the UN is pushing for a one-world government and if they have ever been trying to do that they have done a completely terrible job since that would clearly require the US cooperation which will never happen. That would also require China, Russia, the more powerful countries in Europe, and countries like Brazil and Saudi Arabia who have a lot of influence to be working towards this, but there has been no push for more open borders or much reduced immigration restrictions, not in any serious way at least. However, there has been no effort wasted helping the rich get their money in tax havens and letting them employ low wage workers in poor countries while using their influence to keep wages low in places like Haiti so that they can keep their profits. This screws over not only the people in the poor countries who are denied the opportunity to develop on their own terms and get higher standards of living, but it also screws over the working poor in America who have been shafted ever since the late 70s by every president and congress who have worked in the interest of big companies. This is also the reason why governments only try and take small steps to address climate change, because it does affect bottom lines and could hurt the wealthy which is why they say a lot but do very little. And yes dissent is important and I truly do wish there is no issue with our climate, would be nice to not have to worry about that on top of all the other bullshit that goes on in this world everyday, but again, what benefits does it give for the people in power to promote something that makes them seem incompetent and ineffective in the eyes of people that believe in this? Do they want to be voted out and removed from power or something, because that is the most logical outcome, barring anything drastic, although a financial crisis happening soon (we are overdue for one after all) could exasperate this and accelerate the loss of power for those that currently hold it so who knows. Also, you should know that one person stating something about an organization that has proven to be highly ineffective at resolving real issues like the UN doesn’t mean that that is the end goal, I mean look at how bad they are at stopping anyone that the US or Russia backs.",UCtZPkGeoBse4AOZZ1NmeuXA,1,UgjSTweLWC_QbXgCoAEC,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

What economic benefit do governments gain by encouraging people to try and push them to try and tackle climate change? None, and most of the money is on the side of climate deniers who get paid by oil and gas companies, so if all the governments of the world got together, then conceivably they would want to do what gives them the most monetary benefit which would be everything is fine and there are no problems. They have nothing to gain by spreading this unless you believe that it somehow helps them maintain power despite the fact that people are looking at it in the opposite way (IE people want to remove those in power due to the way its not being addressed). Additionally, there is massive scientific consensus on this topic, more than almost anything else, so unless you think every single government in the world is working supposedly advance this hoax that almost all scientists in the entire world agrees(and again, how does this benefit the government in any way other than making them look incompetent)is being caused mainly by human activity, then you have to provide pretty damn good evidence. I am no big fan of government and specifically the US government, but you need to have some basis in reality in order to make a claim like this and it is simple fact that most people who are actively pushing climate denial are paid by oil companies or those related to it and they are not quiet about it so I guess you are ignoring that too and treating it as if you are the only one saying what you are saying. So to summarize, you need proof and motivation (IE why even waste money doing something that would be better left undisclosed if they had their own self interests in mind) and some good and substantial evidence backing your point. And before you say it, yes climate change has happened in the past, but those were mainly caused by either catastrophic events, or happened over a much longer period of time than what is happening right now. In 25 to 30 years, if we dont make major changes then I hope you are willing to let a bunch of people from Southeast Asia and Africa into your town, cause that will inevitably happen due to the fact that a large percent of the worlds population lives near the coast, and they wont just sit there and drown, they will try to come to the US and other places that can afford the space to accommodate them.",UCtZPkGeoBse4AOZZ1NmeuXA,1,UgjSTweLWC_QbXgCoAEC,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

Of course there is climate change. There always has been. However, there are longer periods of warming and shorter periods of cooling, one of which we are now in. The denial of facts by using models to explain things which are not happening (eg warming since 1998) is where the debate is becoming debased. Facts are being sacrificed at the altar of economic benefit to the few who are pushing the debate (eg Gore, Hansen et al) and the academics whose jobs depend upon stirring the hysteria, as against those who have no axe to grind and who are the actual majority in science. Many of these are very senior individuals (professors emeriti and Nobel prizewinners amongst them) who have nothing to gain and who are horrified at the outright lies being pushed at the public, often through the media who are also making a nice whack out of it (after all, it sells lots of papers and gets lots of ratings for TV and, therefore, TV advertising). Contrary to Mr Chomsky&#39;s point, those in the oil industry are strictly forbidden to voice opinions by their companies, as they are seen as being against the so-called &quot;consensus&quot;. The last thing they want is to be drawn into the debate and be branded as &quot;deniers&quot;. In conclusion, I suggest that those who want to find out the actual science behind this look at some contributions by those who will NOT make money out of it and also check those who use scientific data which has not been &quot;adjusted&quot; by those whose models do not fit the real facts. Do not be misled by those who manipulate data.

Its a biological tool that has helped motivate ours(and other animal's) survival in trying situations. Fear can be exploited just like anything else so people need to also try to be well informed themselves and there needs to be some good faith amongst the people of society (ie in this context Scientists at large). Just because sometimes fear has been created as a ploy when nothing wrong is occurring, look at Invasion of Iraq, does not mean that at all times it is a ploy. The final point I have here, where I think we could have the most value of discussion, is that 'rule' and 'freedom' are catchphrases that have no real-world practical meaning. Let me rephrase that in line with the topic: If you think that Global Warming and Climate Change are being used as justification to impose more 'rules' then yes I agree. Much like we impose rules about engine emissions like NOx and SOx (which are directly poisonous) we can impose rules against dangerously increasing our CO2 emissions. If you think that such rules REQUIRE a loss of freedom we disagree greatly. Freedom is a fundamentally abstract concept - true freedom is that fabled Citizen One of Nation None. They can do whatever they wish to whomever they wish for whatever reason they wish. This is the natural state, this is anarchy. Now that Anarchistic Freedom allows a person to do an awful lot - so long as they have the means - (we'll find that no Island Man can make a city or a car from raw earthly materials). But let us also suppose that that person now has the value of a Competitive existence. Now his absolute freedom is no longer absolute freedom when confronted by another Citizen One, they have no rules between them to break and either one can steal from, maim, or kill the other at no consequence. What I am trying to say, very long windedly, is that there are many kinds of freedom.

His pronouncements and his understanding of the fascist (i.e., radical authoritarian pan-nationalist) climate agenda to control other’s lives are priceless. For an individual considered to be some kind of a sage if not oracle, he completely ignores the potential that the 98% of ‘climate scientists’ have an incredibly strong tribal bias toward toting the company line. (Note the ‘adjustment’ to the often cited figure of 97% of ‘climate scientists’. The cheerleaders just can’t help themselves. They even ‘adjust’ this figure upward.)<br /><br />The death knell is not for the species but for any ‘climate scientist’ who challenges the orthodoxy. The individual will be ostracized within their academic department (an incredibly strong tribal group) and government funding will be quickly eliminated along with any chance to publish.<br /><br />The current pause is 18 years 9 months based on RSS and UAT satellite data (Quality Group I) as corroborated by weather balloon data. This cannot be said of the surface temperature (Quality Group II) machinations of the manipulators, which show ‘calculated’ temperatures increasingly drifting upward from reality. (Think of the Pixar classic &#39;Up&#39;, a wonderful movie but a really bad representation of the reality of lighter-than-air machines.)<br /><br />But he just can&#39;t stop himself there.

When I look at the NOAA graphing page, almost everywhere in the USA has seen no warming or a little cooling for the last 15 years or so, compared to a very high rate of warming from 1980 onwards. The same thing is true when we configure it for the Global temperature (unfortunately we cannot see component countries and continents of the Globe). Only the Sea temperature, not the Sea+Land has shown much recent warming. Google around and you will see a lot of papers trying to explain how the sea could be soaking up the warming, and how it will eventually spring back. A popular theory seems to be that the recently very strong  El Nino cycle has resulted in strong easterly winds which have transferred water or at least the heat in it, westward, resulting in cooling over the land. And most parts of Antarctica have shown recent cooling, even though the Larsen B shelf is clearly warming. The solution to this anomaly seems to be to concentrate on Larsen B, even though it is a very small proportion of Antarctica, which sticks out into warm Pacific currents.<br />Despite the recent industrialisation of China and India and far Eastern countries like Korea, the percentage CO2 in the atmosphere continues to rise at approximately the same rate as 10 years ago.<br />All this casts doubt on the current estimates of the warming rate, which were made in the 90&#39;s, it appears on statistical grounds only, not on deep models which explain the actual mechanisms.<br />So, although nobody could deny either the rise in CO2 or the effect of Global Warming, it does appear likely that we have a bit more time to plan than we expected. Timing is important, since the technology continues to improve. I was putting off installing solar panels until the promised new designs with +30% efficiency arrived.

I have searched for a similar graphing facility over Europe, unsuccessfully. I expect the southern hemisphere's contribution to the Land component of  NOAA's Global Land and Water is overwhelmingly from satellites, and I wonder how satellite data is merged with US weather stations, if at all.  Although I scanned the 1985? paper on recalibrating satellite data, standing away from the problem for a bit, it seems strange that the visual image from the satellite was not used to identify weather stations and compare their temperatures with those from the infra-red detector in the satellite. Do it that way, on a regular basis, and any decay in the orbit could not introduce errors. So I always confine my considerations to post-1980 (and presumably post-recalibration).” Again, what do you think the short term temperature fluctuations will tell us?   It's heresy I know, but I think it would make more sense for us to just try to get a good average measurement once a year or once every few years.  If you want to see RELIABLY how the energy is increasing — causing the delays of the seasonal turnovers and energetic weather events, all you have to do is look at charts that we analyze every day.  As we say, these large-scale weather systems are integrating everything perfectly, the strengthenings, the dampenings, the delays due to inertia, the interactions between low level temperature gradient and the stratospheric warming bubbles and the various interfering collisions. “We are told that post-Argo, ""we know a lot more about sea temperature and it is going up faster than expected"". I am unclear as to whether the figure for Global Land and Sea that I obtained from the NOAA graphing site includes this new data. When I look at maps of Argo buoys, there are none over a 1000 mile strip around Antarctica. Not surprising, because the sea ice has increased, and presumably the buoys cannot resurface to transmit to satellite. But this is very deep water with a high thermal capacity,  (which is now counteractively shielded by albedo so is absorbing less), so that could be where the missing heat is hiding, But I see no discussion of this. This could be a significant negative feedback effect, with the heat never being released, buying us many more decades.” 20 years ago climatologists were expecting the high-level circulation around Antarctica to increase in strength with the energy of global warming.  This also intensifies the current around the continent.  This has the opposite effect of what's happening in the northern high latitudes.  The cold air down there is being held in place because it's not allowed to escape to the north from Antarctica.  There's also been more precipitation due to elevated levels of precipitable water.  This has all been caused by global warming, and we're lucky that this phenomenon will last for a few more decades.",UCM3uTBDZsyyRHdfVJnfxnLw,1,UggYbkzfUFwQ_HgCoAEC,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

From at least one paper, that theory of heat storage seems to being linked to the El Ninos, which are claimed to be very large recently. But when I look at graphs of these, the area under the spikes does not seem overwhelmingly large recently. I have recently started to look at Dr. John Christy's videos, and he has all sorts of contra-warming data from hurricanes, crop yields and so on, which I have not had time to check.We do keep hearing the sort of prediction you make: ""As a statistician, you'll see the rise soon"", but given my worries over all these unknowns, I wonder at such certitude. I think the politicians are now walking a fairly rational line, stopping high CO2 emitting projects like oil-sand extraction, but cutting back (at least here in the UK) on excessive spending on renewables (apart from a DC link from Iceland to the UK to feed us with geothermal energy which seems a good idea).

Doing it over 6 months: ending in June it is going down, ending in December it is going up.” The States are far too small an expanse to represent the planet.  Here in the States, El Niño has had two unexpected results (at least I didn't expect them last autumn and I didn't read anything about them in the technical papers).  El Niño has strengthened the temperature (north/south) gradient over the eastern half of the US and that has strengthened the Arctic circulation.  Therefore it's been abnormally warm in the eastern half of the US - November through most of January.  The second thing that El Niño did was to add energy to the Pacific weather systems and this has mimicked what the retreating Sun does in the autumn so that California and the Northwest have gotten more than their average amount of rain.",UCM3uTBDZsyyRHdfVJnfxnLw,1,UggYbkzfUFwQ_HgCoAEC,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

Articles from our Met office agree with your data, about accurate models out to 16 days. The TV program probably ignored local wind speed variations and so missed this quite narrow jet stream? I just assumed that since they launched a balloon and failed to find it, that it was unpredictable. You asked what caused the month-by-month variations in temperatures in the NorthEast US, and I said TV programs said it was variations in the jet stream, at least here in the UK. Your answer, and our Met Office site seem to support that. So regarding climate data, I am still left with a decline in temperature from 2000 to 2015 in the NorthEast US, and just one very freakish high temperature for the December just gone. I know you have expressed no opinion or explanation for this, but others have. I distrust priest-class claims that since I don't understand details of the weather, my opinion on climate change is worthless. I still take the position that CO2 has continued to rise, but that temperature, according to the NOAA graphing site, has in the USA been flat or declining since 2000. I just plotted again, this time for the Contiguous States USA, between 2000 and 2015, asking for the trend, plotted for the previous 12 months ending in December. It is completely flat. Doing it over 6 months: ending in June it is going down, ending in December it is going up. When I do it for Global Land and Sea, in December over the previous 12 months, it is rising at about 0.125C over that 14 years, if you ignore the year just gone, and if you don't ignore it, the rise is about 0.14C over 15 years. So on the face of it the last year is anomalous. This could be the start of a bound-back and the release of heat trapped in the deep sea over the 14 year period. Some papers hypothesise such a mechanism. I await another 2 or 3 years of results before forming an opinion.Anyway, Obama seems to be abandoning the pipeline from the Canadian tar sands, and is predicting support for renewables.

Everything about your local weather is caused by the jetstream that's near you.  If you live in the very high latitudes or in the tropics there are other upper air winds which determine your weather, but everything about your surface weather, no exceptions, is caused by these strong winds.  If you don't know what they're doing and when and why — you don't know about weather and you can't understand it.  If you don't know about weather you can't know about climate change and so it's really silly to have an opinion about it.  People look out their windows every day of their lives and it emboldens them to think that they know how weather works. They don’t.   You have to study it. First you have to study fluid mechanics and it all leads up to understanding Rossby wave theory.  After you learn the theory then you need experience with the circulation patterns.  This takes about 3 to 4 years of observing seasonal turnovers. Most of what you posted about weather is, I'm sorry to say, a bunch of bad assumptions.  Weather balloons miss the jetstream?  If they end up in the jetstream the data is less useful, so this statement really struck me.   All the data it is extrapolated across the nested grid for the numerical weather prediction models.  We can now give a reliable forecast for any parcel of air, surface to 40,000ft, across the planet, out to about 16 days.  I'm sure you would be very impressed by the models.",UCM3uTBDZsyyRHdfVJnfxnLw,1,UggYbkzfUFwQ_HgCoAEC,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

Currently I am modelling language, which is why I keep looking at Chomsky videos. I prefer Pinker, Jackendoff, and Lakoff to Chomsky, who seems quite entrenched in his original idea of a genetically determined internal language. I think with our modern ideas on machine learning and subsumption hierarchies, that Chomsky's ""poverty of stimulus"" is a myth. Goldberg is very good, on how her children learnt language, using covariance, but without her giving any equations. From time to time I read some papers on climate change, which is why I just put in solar panels, before our government reduced its feed-in subsidy. Here in the UK, our winters have always been unpredictable, with unseasonably warm temperatures and heavy rain and widespread flooding for the last 4 weeks, now replaced by -4C, mainly clear skies, but quite a bit of snow. Reliable-looking TV programs tell us this is because of movements in the jet stream, for which there seems to be no reliable model. Currently they say that the Arctic polar vortex is speeding up the jet stream so that it meanders less. They think climate change is responsible for this effect. Apparently the only way to measure the jet stream is by putting up weather balloons, and most miss it since it is some 300 miles across. So it is not well understood. Going back to NOAA graphs, if we request 12 month smoothing, for the NorthEast USA in December, since 1980, and check Display Trend for 1980 to present, they show a linear regression line that rises about 0.8C over the 35 years. But if you ask for 2000 to the present there is a slightly falling trend, but then this is preceded by a much steeper line from 1980 to 2000. Clearly the swings from 2000 are more pronounced, which is what our TV programs are telling us. There is quite a good Scientific American article from March, that talks of future rises of 0.4C per decade. That would contrast with the Trends above. The theory seems to rest on heat being temporarily trapped in the ocean, to be released later. Two particularly strong El Ninos are blamed for the downward trend, in another paper. I hope this helps. I suspect the next 2 or 3 years will confirm the heat storage theory, one way or the other.",UCq5CvrebnQ7iqR4YUw8iewQ,1,UggYbkzfUFwQ_HgCoAEC,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

For the other months in the year just gone we have: Sept. +3.5   This looks to be the start of the Dec peak, but ... Oct  0   dead on the average line, which is incidentally well below the average since 1980. Nov same as most other peaks back to 2000, so essentially flat Jan 2C below the 1901-2000 average Feb -5.5 and the biggest negative since 1980 So December looks like a short-term anomaly.

It constantly SEEKS equilibrium which is how we get weather. Water is actually in constant flux. Global climate CHANGE is a fact even the dinosaurs knew. But global WARMING came from statistical forecast that did not in fact pan out in data over time. Meanwhile - independent of computer models - water is doing whatever it is water does in its cycle of gas/liquid/solid/liquid (not including partial states e.g., sublimation, etc.). That said, there is an ozone hole only just discovered in the 1970s. They did not know whether it was 'normal' or man made, only that they found it. And that it was getting larger. In 1974 it was the size of a football field over Antarctica - alarming enough - but by 2015 it had grown to the size of a continent still roughly off center of Antarctica (current calculations say size of North America). Speculation at the time of discovery in the early 1970s was it was industrial caused. My suspicion however is it was an Antarctic research experiment gone wrong - probably expanding on the 'free energy source using the atmosphere' proposed by Tesla, and they were shocked it turned out to be a chain reaction they couldn't stop. That crap happens in science all the time. But this expanding hole would make the earth colder not warmer, and I doubt it would be affected by methane, so that part I think is geo-political rogue science. Heat escapes out an ozone hole, and isn't retained by it regardless of phase state properties of H2O.

First, a rebuttal of your claim regarding some ""anti-industrialization"" (which is a judgement of intentions trying to impugn motives on others, having no value in the debate - it's only rhetorics). Second, the ""real"" facts about Ice Age that we have under hand: its cycles having consequences in CO2 level, and the impact of man-made CO2 (for which I'd invite you to dig further more since my time is limited and I'm not writing a book here). 1- *I'm not agaisnt industrialization, it's quite the opposite :* it produces goods via a cheaper COGS, allowing access to those goods for much more people, as well as entrepreneurial ""freedom"" and creativity for the many (i.e. if nuts and bolts and computer parts for instance, weren't provided by ""industrialized"" manufactures, then such access to entrepreneurship couldn't happen). Personally I don't see why anyone could be against this fundamental idea which keeps us on an evolving path... *What's debatable though*, and which should be the object of a constant and open minded Evolution (else the entrepreneurial evolutionary path for humanity that I was talking about has its cycle broken, and ends up in a permanent state which is currently environmentally deviant), what should be in constant evaluation/R&D are the technological means that are used, and their impact outside its own leitmotiv of productive efficiency and money : *the World is not meant to serve industrialization, it must be the other way around.* _Hence, IMHO any reasoning using this as a central argument in regards to climate change would be a pure psychological projection (maybe provoked by an intellectual lazyness for protecting a stance of denial and/or interest, by trying to ""pshychologize"" the debate just to save money on R&D and tech scaling... I don't really know why, I'm not a shrink, I just find this weird)._ 2.1 *Ice Age cycles* - Over the last 40 million years the CO2 level in the atmosphere has fallen from 1000-2000 ppmv to a minimum of 180 ppmv 20.000 years ago. Not since the Perm period circa 250 million years ago has the CO2 level been so low (an evolving mechanism since the creation of our planet, which allowed for life to happen, thrive and evolve by itself - and for us to exist today). However, since the beginning of the XXth century, never have the CO2 level risen so abruptly (+40%-50%) since 3 million years... There were then approximately 8 cycles (of different intensity) in the last 800,000 years, like some stabilizing process, and we could measure that the CO2 level varies with these cycles: when it's cold there's less CO2 and when it's warmer the level is higher. We found that this CO2 feedback has significance as even small changes in solar _radiation_ have had great effects: CO2 works as an _intensifier_ (that's the word I should've used in a previous post). It has nothing to do with Sun cycles which are of a very short time period. http://www.nbi.ku.dk/english/sciencexplorer/earth_and_climate/golden_spike/video/spoergsmaal_svar1/ 2.2 - Lately and by using improved methods, *examination of more than 1,000 glacial boulders has produced a more accurate timetable for the pre-historic meltdown. It pinpoints the rise in carbon dioxide*, which was then naturally occurring before it stabilized for the mere «perfect» balance our planet currently has (in regards to organic life as we know it). It's proven to be the primary driving factor in the simultaneous global retreat of glaciers during the last Ice Age closure. Which has implications for rising levels of man-made greenhouse gases and retreating glaciers today. *In short : we are abruptly breaking the planet's natural cycles.* More over, recent studies are demonstrating that we are retarding the next cycle due to the current global warming over which we are responsible. http://phys.org/news/2015-08-ice-age-greenhouse-gas-factor.html http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-thawed-the-last-ice-age/ http://www.tvanouvelles.ca/2016/01/14/la-prochaine-ere-glaciaire-serait-retardee-a-cause-du-rechauffement",UCjZP3_A5q1S0bhB3NnWF7ow,1,UghMp220xMFAeXgCoAEC,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

I'm not saying this means I can understand the issue and you can't. A year ago, I was skeptical of anthropogenic global warming too. I decided that if I really wanted to figure out what was true, I should pick up a book written by scientists about the issue. After all, they are the ones who study the climate for a living.

The oil economy is far more about collectivism that the independent generation of electricity by individual homeowners. We need to maintain vast armies, paid for collectively, to protect the petro-dollar and big oil's international interests. What harm will ""global warming hysteria"" cause the third world? Oil wars have reduced countries to third world status, and threatened first world countries with influxes of refugees from fundamentalist religious areas? Because of oil the US props up the barbaric house of Saud, which aggressively promotes the most regressive cult on earth, relegating millions of women to almost sub human status, and tens of millions of others are kept in medieval ignorance because of the influence of wahhabism. If it were not for the power of oil, the house of saud would have long ago been swept away into the dust bin of history where it belongs. Never mind ""global warming hysteria""- which I agree does exist,, but just the conservative estimation of effects that climate change is virtually certain to cause will displace hundreds of millions of the world's poorest people in Bangladesh, India, and North Eastern China.....Tell me again what the terrible effects of the movement to green energy has had on Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands, where the price of power has dropped below 0 at times due to the massive generation of inexpensive energy? Some birds got killed? Ever seen an oil spill? Only insane people see communism behind every sensible policy.

Chomsky happens to be one of my heroes (own several of his books)…but he “misses the boat” (has a &quot;blind-spot&quot; or a hidden agenda) on two topics.   <br />ONE: He refuses to deny the Official Narrative that “9-11” was executed by a young band of Islamists with box-cutters and a few hours of flight training...which has clearly been used as a pretext for the horrific &quot;War on Terrorism&quot; and military campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan. Incidentally, he was called on this issue a few years ago, and he was honest enough to admit, “Well, you have to understand that I work for MIT.”   <br /><br />TWO: He has jumped on the bandwagon of this Anthropogenic Global Warming<br />hypothesis, which has very little legitimate scientific basis.  Man, what levels of antagonistic venom and hysteria on this topic!!  Plenty of name-calling and arguments &quot;ad personam!&quot;  Incidentally, calling someone an insipid name like &quot;Denier&quot; is nothing better than a Crusades Era soldier calling an enemy an &quot;Infidel&quot; or a &quot;Godless Arab!!&quot; and lopping off his head. It ends all discourse and removes any possibility of intelligent pursuit of the truth (while demonizing the opposing party, and revealing one&#39;s stupidity). This is the way of the demagogue, the autocrat, the propagandist. <br /><br />The fact is that though we certainly have some legitimate environmental and ecological concerns (such as the rapid devastation of the Brazilian rain-forest. and horrific smog-filled cities in India and China, e.g.), the AGW hypothesis has not panned out. The observed temperature elevation turned out to be extremely mild (less than one degree...and nothing like the dramatic changes observed during the &quot;Little Ice-Age&quot; and &quot;Medieval Warm Period&quot;), a trend which ended around 1998, and the predictions of sea-rise have not materialized. What&#39;s more, CO2 is NOT the noxious-toxic gas that most everyone has been claiming. It comprises a tiny % of the terran atmosphere, is innocuous (unlike its cousin, CO), and is ALSO not the primary &quot;greenhouse gas,&quot; with that honor going to water vapor, followed by natural gas--methane. There are at least a half dozen other problems with this &quot;climate dogma,&quot; but this should be sufficient to at least get some a few open minded, intelligent folk start considering some other possibilities...apart from what some &quot;experts&quot;...or the media…or politicians... have been ranting about in the style of demagoguery and propaganda. <br />I encourage people to seek out the facts, then attempt to draw conclusions based on those facts...employing &quot;critical inquiry&quot; (including the tools of logical thinking)…and I suggest that one be keenly wary of simply “jumping on the bandwagon” (frequently resulting in a step off into the abyss of error).",UCud6XbbBiPfK3WCyIk9MXQg,0,UgiPZhEWFNR-hngCoAEC,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

It's at the high end of models. http://www.skepticalscience.com/images/SLR_models_obs.gif Tiny thing can have big effect. Water vapor levels in the atmosphere is controlled by the temperature. Even is every body of water would suddeny turn into atmospheric vapor, it would just come crashing down as rain. Methane is more prominent gas but much less abundant, it has smaller effect. Humans also produce mehane industrially. There are problems with climate, but to extent you believe. Open minded in today's terms means basically blind faith. Do I trust the government?

The public&#39;s hatred of Democrats, Republicans, big business and banks and the public&#39;s distrust of scientists all lead to general disregard for the findings of &quot;pointy-headed elitists.&quot; The 2010 elections could be interpreted as a &quot;death knell for the species&quot; because most of the new Republicans in Congress are global warming deniers. &quot;If this was happening in some small country,&quot; Chomsky concludes, &quot;it wouldn&#39;t matter much. But when it&#39;s happening in the richest, most powerful country in the world, it&#39;s a danger to the survival of the species.&quot;<br /><br />Visit <a href=""http://www.TheNation.com"">www.TheNation.com</a> to learn more about &quot;Peak Oil and a Changing Climate,&quot; and to see the other videos in the series.<br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJUA4cm0Rck"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJUA4cm0Rck</a><br />Category<br />News &amp; Politics<br />Licence<br />Standard YouTube Licence<br />JUN 17, 2015",UCmfjPv-lQ0ZTjvNfaNwWjJw,0,Ugh9w9bGtlxHVXgCoAEC,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

Ice core records from the past 650,000 years show that temperature increases have preceded— not resulted from — increases in CO2 by hundreds of years, suggesting that the warming of the oceans is an important source of the rise in atmospheric CO2. As the dominant greenhouse gas, water vapour is far, far more important than CO2. Dire predictions of future warming are based almost entirely on computer climate models, yet these models do not accurately understand the role or water vapor — and, in any case, water vapor is not within our control. Plus, computer models cannot account for the observed cooling of much of the past century (1940-75), nor for the observed patterns of warming — what we call the &quot;fingerprints.&quot; For example, the Antarctic is cooling while models predict warming. And where the models call for the middle atmosphere to warm faster than the surface, the observations show the exact opposite.<br /> <br />--S.

The opposition against this comes largely unsubstantiated claims or is based on outdated models. While he cannot prove the exact motive or agenda of those who push these claims, he starts on the basic assumption that they present these banal falsities because they want people to believe them. When he calls them unscientific, or liars, or even manipulative, the evidence is much more in favor of these conclusions than the contrary. In terms of his use of the term ""liberal hoax"", that is not of his words, but rather a phrase used by these lobbying interests and spread through political interactions and news media.

It is just a bluff. They are both socialist, because of the collectivist concept. No totalitarian regime can be right, even if it is called exterme right. You can take ancient pharao regime in Egypt and end up with modern communist regime in China. Totalitarian government must have control over citizenry otherwise it could not keep its power. People forgot the distinctions between right and left. I think I have read a text that it was in old french parliament where on the right sat representatives which deffended civil rights, freedom of speech, etc, (therefore Right) while on the left side there sat people which prefered royal absolutism (therefore Left). There is no royal absolutism today however, there is socialist absolutism represented by left wing parties. They took over the left from the royalists. And this is the strugle between left and right. I do not know if you personally like socialism, but the point is that we ordinary people should be for right, to be for civil rights, freedom of speech, free market and to oppose any form of absolutism (royalism, socialism, nazism, absolute monarchy etc.). I think that socialism (and its modifications) are winning today anyway. The West was capitalist once but now it is socialist. And the parody is that all leftwing people think that it is the capitalism which is collapsing just know. Well, it is not. We live in postcapitalistic age, in the age of interventionism and socialism. And if leftwing people would have read Marx (as they say they did) they should know that interventionism is the first level of socialism and it has nothing to do with capitalism. They live in the world they want but they criticized it because they think it is capitalism. Pure schizophrenia. And yes, I like Ron Paul, unfortunately he retired.

When confronted on his failed predictions, Oppenheimer (who also served as Al Gore’s advisor) refused to apologize. “On the whole I would stand by these predictions ….. not predictions, sorry, scenarios ….. as having at least in a general way actually come true,” he claimed. “There’s been extensive drought, devastating drought, in significant parts of the world.

The next year, snowfall across the United Kingdom increased by more than 50 percent. In 2008, perfectly timed for a “global warming” legislation debate in Parliament, London saw its first October snow since 1934. According to the U.K. Register. “It is unusual to have snow this early,” a spokesperson for the alarmist U.K. Met office admitted to The Guardian newspaper.

In early 2004, the CRU’s Viner and other “experts” warned that skiing in Scotland would soon become just a memory, due to global warming. “Unfortunately, it’s just getting too hot for the Scottish ski industry,” Viner told The Guardian. Another “expert,” Adam Watson with the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, told the paper that the skiing industry in Scotland had less than two decades left to go. Yet in 2013, too much snow kept many Scottish resorts closed. “Nevis Range, The Lecht, Cairngorm, Glenshee and Glencoe all remain closed today due to the heavy snow,” reported OnTheSnow.com on January 4, 2013. Ironically, by 2014, the BBC, citing experts, reported that the Scottish hills had more snow than at any point in seven decades. It also reported that the Nevis Range ski resort could not operate some of its lifts because they were “still buried under unprecedented amounts of snow.” . The IPCC’s 2001 Third Assessment Report claimed “milder winter temperatures will decrease heavy snowstorms.” Again, though, the climate refused to cooperate.

This one? http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024024 - So because you limit your research to things you agree with you assume others do the same. I've seen the paper, I've seen it broken down by Cook & I've seen it broken down by skeptics. Guess what? The only way Cook could get anywhere close to a 97% ""consensus"" was to lump every scientists with an opinion about AGW together - which makes his paper meaningless. There's a huge difference between a scientist that believes AGW is real but negligible & possibly beneficial and one who backs the watered down version of the IPCC position Cook was using - it's in the methodology since I'm sure you never actually looked at it. . Of 11,944 papers he only flagged 64 backing his position & 23 of those turned out to be misclassified - that rounds out to 0.3%. If we allow him to count the papers he misclassified it brings it up to 0.5%. If we allow him to throw out the 8,000 papers he threw out (making it a 4000 paper survey, not a 12,000 paper survey) it brings that up to 1.6%. Let me know when we hit 97%. . He misclassified papers by prominent skeptics such as Willie Soon, Craig Idso, Nicola Scafetta, Nir Shaviv, Nils-Axel Morner and Alan Carlin in order to support his findings.. http://www.populartechnology.net/2013/05/97-study-falsely-classifies-scientists.html#Update2 . The University of Queensland are so sure of Cook’s work that they threaten legal action against anyone that dares to even try to look at his data. Brandon Shollenberger came across this information on a third party, unencrypted, unprotected website & got a letter from the university threatening to sue him if he released the data (which he did) or even posted their threatening letter (which he also did.) From this we found, among other things, that the vast majority of the rating were not done independently, as claimed, but instead by his co-authors. There was also no ethics approval for the rating program, as was claimed.. http://peacelegacy.org/sites/default/files/images/now/cease-and-desist-shollenberger-1.pdf . http://www.hi-izuru.org/mirror/ . https://climateaudit.org/2014/07/26/cooks-fake-ethics-approval/ . According to Sarah Green, one of the most active raters - “But, this is clearly not an independent poll, nor really a statistical exercise. We are just assisting in the effort to apply defined criteria to the abstracts with the goal of classifying them as objectively as possible. Disagreements arise because neither the criteria nor the abstracts can be 100% precise. We have already gone down the path of trying to reach a consensus through the discussions of particular cases. From the start we would never be able to claim that ratings were done by independent, unbiased, or random people anyhow.” Yet the claim from Cook & the University was “Each abstract was categorized by two independent, anonymized raters.”. Mr. Nuccitelli, one of the authors of the Cook paper, has written a posting on the “Skeptical Science” blog in which he sought to justify the discrepancy between the abstracts of Legates et al. & the Cook paper (which had assigned to the “explicit endorsement with quantification” category and the “97.1% based on abstract ratings that the conclusion of the Cook paper had claimed endorsed the “scientific consensus” as defined) - “The IPCC position (humans causing most global warming) was represented in our categories 1 and 7, which include papers that explicitly endorse or reject/minimize human-caused global warming, and also quantify the human contribution. Among the relatively few abstracts (75 in total) falling in these two categories, 65 (87%) endorsed the consensus view.” - So the 11,944 paper survey showing a 97.1% “consensus” has become a 75 paper survey showing an 87% “consensus.” A 75 paper survey is not viable. What Cook et al showed was that there is almost no support at all for the IPCC / warming alarmist position on AGW. . Oh, you typed in caps so I guess the Kyoto agreement never happened.

A few years ago, Heidi Cullen of The Weather Channel proposed that anyone in the meteorological business who failed to agree with her views on AGW be decertified. Steve Zwick, a columnist at Forbes called skeptics equivalent to addicts and declared that they should be “the first to pay” for the coming environmental apocalypse, comparing them to people whose houses should burn down because they refused to pay for the fire department. Boston Globe columnist Ellen Goodman has compared AGW “deniers” (aka skeptics) to Holocaust deniers - something repeated by warming alarmists ever since. Bjørn Lomborg (who actually believes that climate change is real and man-made) was compared to Hitler by the head of the IPCC for merely pointing out the economic senselessness of many of the proposals to deal with the problem. This is by no means an exhaustive list. More recently, 20 “scientists” petitioned Obama to use RICO laws to jail skeptics. . This is what passes for debate in climate ""science."". So now we have ""the junk science is proven, debate is forbidden, now's the time to act."" So let's look at the action. . We were told that demon carbon is killing the planet, we have to do whatever we can, no price is too high to save the planet, etc. What do they give us? The Kyoto accord. Financially punish Western industry for the sin of emitting carbon & exempt 80% of the rest of the world (including every single OPEC nation - which combined represented the 4th largest emitter of carbon - & Brazil & Indonesia - where the most extreme deforestation is occurring) thus insuring that those evil levels of planet killing carbon would continue to rise.

To imagine that windfall profits are in climate science rather than war and oil industries and their propaganda is idiotic.

Steve Zwick, a columnist at Forbes called skeptics equivalent to addicts and declared that they should be “the first to pay” for the coming environmental apocalypse, comparing them to people whose houses should burn down because they refused to pay for the fire department. Boston Globe columnist Ellen Goodman has compared AGW “deniers” (aka skeptics) to Holocaust deniers - something repeated by warming alarmists ever since. Bjørn Lomborg (who actually believes that climate change is real and man-made) was compared to Hitler by the head of the IPCC for merely pointing out the economic senselessness of many of the proposals to deal with the problem. This is by no means an exhaustive list. More recently, 20 “scientists” petitioned Obama to use RICO laws to jail skeptics.

API then launched a multimillion-dollar campaign in the 1990s to persuade the public that the science around climate change was ""uncertain,"" InsideClimate News reported. API did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The Columbia researchers who prepared the report for API predicted global temperatures would rise by up to 4 degrees Celsius over the next hundred years. A 4-degree increase would likely have devastating effects on the planet, including widespread species loss, increased food insecurity, stronger storms and more severe coastal flooding, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The Columbia report also said the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere ""is expected to double some time in the [21st] century. Just when depends on the particular estimate of the level of increasing energy use per year and the mix of carbon based fuels.""InsideClimate News revealed in September that top executives at Exxon knew about global warming as early as 1977. Instead of cleaning up its act, Exxon waged a $16 million campaign in the 1990s to block proposed regulations on greenhouse gas emissions and to persuade the public that climate science was unreliable, according to a report from the Los Angeles Times and journalists at Columbia University in October.  The report triggered an investigation by the New York attorney general into whether Exxon lied to investors about the risks of climate change. That same month, Exxon accused the Columbia journalists who worked on the story of ethics violations for ""cherry picking"" evidence.  It became clear in December that several major oil companies affiliated with API had early knowledge of climate change. The newly surfaced report obtained by InsideClimate News shows that the information about global warming available to members of the trade group was detailed and clearly outlined the risks of emitting large volumes of CO2. In 1998, almost two decades after learning about global warming, API continued to publicly doubt the existence of climate change, according to an internal API memomade public by the Union of Concerned Scientists.“It’s not known for sure whether (a) climate change actually is occurring, or (b) if it is, whether humans really have any influence on it,"" API wrote in the 1998 memo.Exxon and API's efforts to sow doubt about climate science have significantly delayed government action on climate change, according to environmentalist Bill McKibben. ""Campaigns of disinformation and denial,"" McKibben wrote in the New Yorker in September, ""have slowed -- perhaps fatally -- the planet’s response to global warming.""",UCGrWcMnZ2FavirJOIfLD3_w,1,Uggwv66qqiEbI3gCoAEC,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

Ok, lets start with the ""science"" of AGW. Mann (from Penn State University) & Briffa (from the Climate Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia) Came up with the ""hockey stick"" graph which was the ""proof"" that the ""science"" was settled. It was the centerpiece of Al Gores crockumentry. Yet they refused to make their work available for scrutiny. You see, when a major breakthrough or discovery of this type is made, you're supposed to show how you achieved it in order to see if it stands up to scrutiny & is duplicable. Science is based on truth, not blind faith. They refused, despite repeated freedom of information requests on both sides of the Atlantic. They also pressured scientific journals too keep out the work of skeptics. Where were their peers? If there was any real science being done here there would have at least been an investigation at this point. Nope, all just business as usual in the world of climate ""science."" After climate-gate erupted (over 2100 documents & e-mails were leaked showing that they were saying one thing publicly & quite another privately) they were finally forced to show their work & data sets by the Royal Society & a special investigator. Guess what? No blade on the hockey stick. They lied. If there was real science going on in the world of climate ""science"" that would have been the end of them. Their work, their data, their lie. Their careers would have been over right there. But not in the world of climate science. They were cleared of all wrongdoing. You get that? Unlike in real science, with climate ""science"" you can withhold your data, smear critics, pressure scientific journals to keep out the work of skeptics, get caught doing the most unscientific activities, be found out to be a total & utter fraud & yet still be cleared of any wrongdoing. Since then, the world of climate ""science"" has been feeding us nothing but lies, half-truths & manipulated data. Disappearing arctic ice that fails repeatedly disappear on one predicted date after another & continues to disappear even though satellite photos show record growth. The vanishing polar bears who's numbers continue to rise as they're supposedly dwindling. Decades of alarming ocean level rise that never produces the massive global coastal flooding that should have happened many years ago. The tens of millions of ""climate refugees"" that failed to materialize in 2012. NOAA deciding they can simply change climate history by rewriting the data, despite their revised data contradicting all other data sets. 2014 the hottest year on record turns out to (as stated in their own report) be only 38% likely of being the warmest on record (& even then depending on highly questionable surface data.) A 97.1% consensus in the scientific community which turns out to be a 0.3% backing of the IPCC / alarmist position on AGW. & on & on & on.   It's telling that you only seem to have comments related to politics (climate ""science"" seems to be purely politically motivate) & religion (since it takes a blind cult-like faith to believe in AGW alarmism.)

This was trumpeted by global warming alarmists & corrupt politicians as further “proof” of the “proven science.” The problems with it occurred immediately upon viewing it. 　 Cook considered the standard definition: that Man had caused most post-1950 warming. A somewhat weaker definition than that of the IPCC - the true consensus among published scientific papers is now shown to be not 97.1%, as Cook had claimed, but only 0.3%. Of the 11,944 papers Cook examined, he had only flagged 64 of them as explicitly supporting his phoney consensus. It was then found, upon investigation, that 23 of those papers had not supported it at all. Also found upon investigation, Cook used 3 distinct definitions of climate consensus interchangeably instead of defining the survey question clearly, as a survey of this type requires. He arbitrarily excluded about 8000 of the papers on the unacceptable ground that they expressed no opinion on the climate consensus. He misclassified papers by prominent skeptics such as Willie Soon, Craig Idso, Nicola Scafetta, Nir Shaviv, Nils-Axel Morner and Alan Carlin in order to support his findings. 　 http://www.populartechnology.net/2013/05/97-study-falsely-classifies-scientists.html#Update2 Oh, but that’s not all. The University of Queensland are so sure of Cook’s work that they threaten legal action against anyone that dares to even try to look at his data. Brandon Shollenberger came across this information on a third party, unencrypted, unprotected website & got a letter from the university threatening to sue him if he released the data (which he did) or even posted their threatening letter (which he also did.) From this we found, among other things, that the vast majority of the rating were not done independently, as claimed, but instead by his co-authors. There was also no ethics approval for the rating program, as was claimed. 　 http://www.steynonline.com/documents/6353.pdf http://climateaudit.org/2014/07/26/cooks-fake-ethics-approval/ http://www.hi-izuru.org/mirror/ According to Sarah Green, one of the most active raters - “But, this is clearly not an independent poll, nor really a statistical exercise. We are just assisting in the effort to apply defined criteria to the abstracts with the goal of classifying them as objectively as possible. Disagreements arise because neither the criteria nor the abstracts can be 100% precise. We have already gone down the path of trying to reach a consensus through the discussions of particular cases. From the start we would never be able to claim that ratings were done by independent, unbiased, or random people anyhow.” Yet the claim from Cook & the University was “Each abstract was categorized by two independent, anonymized raters.” 　 Mr. Nuccitelli, one of the authors of the Cook paper, has written a posting on the “Skeptical Science” blog in which he sought to justify the discrepancy between the abstracts of Legates et al. & the Cook paper (which had assigned to the “explicit endorsement with quantification” category and the “97.1% based on abstract ratings that the conclusion of the Cook paper had claimed endorsed the “scientific consensus” as defined) - “The IPCC position (humans causing most global warming) was represented in our categories 1 and 7, which include papers that explicitly endorse or reject/minimize human-caused global warming, and also quantify the human contribution. Among the relatively few abstracts (75 in total) falling in these two categories, 65 (87%) endorsed the consensus view.” - So the 11,944 paper survey showing a 97.1% “consensus” has become a 75 paper survey showing an 87% “consensus.” A 75 paper survey is not viable. What Cook et al showed was that there is almost no support at all for the IPCC / warming alarmist position on AGW.",UCIt_7AOwyTvX0TdcOC-c1fQ,1,Uggwv66qqiEbI3gCoAEC,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

I think you have failed to do this. Your approach of trying to gain scientific credibility for your personal views by asking people to endorse your letter is reprehensible. No scientist who wishes to maintain respect in the community should ever endorse any statement unless they have examined the issue fully themselves. You are asking people to prostitute themselves by doing just this! I fear that some will endorse your letter, in the mistaken belief that you are making a balanced and knowledgeable assessment of the science—when, in fact, you are presenting a flawed view that neither accords with the IPCC nor with the bulk of the scientific and economic literature on the subject. … When scientists color the science with their own personal views or make categorical statements without presenting the evidence for such statements, they have a clear responsibility to state that that is what they are doing. You have failed to do so. Indeed, what you are doing is, in my view, a form of dishonesty more subtle but no less egregious than the statements made by the greenhouse skeptics ….

I would like to weigh in on two important questions— Distribution for Endorsements— I am very strongly in favor of as wide and rapid a distribution as possible for endorsements. I think the only thing that counts is numbers. The media is going to say “1000 scientists signed” or “1500 signed”. No one is going to check if it is 600 with PhDs versus 2000 without. They will mention the prominent ones, but that is a different story.” This statement alone shows how ridiculous the “endorsement” process was from the very beginning. Alcamo continues: “Timing—I feel strongly that the week of 24 November is too late. 1. We wanted to announce the Statement in the period when there was a sag in related news, but in the week before Kyoto we should expect that we will have to crowd out many other articles about climate. 2. If the Statement comes out just a few days before Kyoto I am afraid that the delegates who we want to influence will not have any time to pay attention to it. We should give them a few weeks to hear about it. 3. If Greenpeace is having an event the week before, we should have it a week before them so that they and other Non-Governmental Organizations can further spread the word about the Statement. On the other hand, it wouldn’t be so bad to release the Statement in the same week, but on a different day. The media might enjoy hearing the message from two very different directions. Conclusion I suggest the week of 10 November, or the week of 17 November at the latest.” Alcamo demonstrates that this is a carefully crafted piece of political activism, not related to the scientific process at all. Indeed, the optimization of the timing - allowing just enough time for delegates to absorb the message, but not enough time for the scientists signing on to this petition to actually examine or criticize its contents will return with a vengeance.",UCIt_7AOwyTvX0TdcOC-c1fQ,1,Uggwv66qqiEbI3gCoAEC,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

We could also give this to Neville Nicholls (climate scientist at the Bureau of Meteorology Research Centre in Melbourne, Australia)?” Lest it be thought that this may be standard public relations procedure for the Met(eorological) Office, Jenkins puts the issue beyond doubt: “I know it sound a bit cloak-and-dagger but it’s just meant to save time in the long run.” In other words, Jenkins was more interested in getting “headline” numbers out to the general public, than in ensuring an impartial release of information to all members of the press at the same time.",UCIt_7AOwyTvX0TdcOC-c1fQ,1,Uggwv66qqiEbI3gCoAEC,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

He is nowhere near as good as a couple of yours and he’s an utter prat but he’s getting a lot of air time at the moment.” Robock requires an American translation: “Could you please define “utter prat” for me? Sometimes I think we speak the same language, and sometimes I’m not so sure.” Jones is immediately reporting the existence of this first British skeptic to climate scientists on the other side of the Atlantic, taking special note of the exposure on television or radio (air time) that the skeptic is apparently receiving. Of course politics and “spin doctoring” outweighs the scientific issues.: “For his day job he teaches physics and astronomy at a University and he predicts the weather from solar phenomena.” “He’s not all bad as he doesn’t have much confidence in nuclear-power safety.” Here we clearly see that Jones’s assessment of a scientist’s worth is influenced by his assessment of his or her ideology. In scientific terms, nuclear power safety is completely unrelated to the climate “science.” This will be one of the most persistent threads throughout the Climate-gate scandal.",UCIt_7AOwyTvX0TdcOC-c1fQ,1,Uggwv66qqiEbI3gCoAEC,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

These forecasts were crucial to many of the other predictions about surging sea levels and related doomsday nonsense. The problem is that the opposite happened. Sea ice in Antarctica is consistently breaking previous record highs on a regular basis & the warming alarmists are searching desperately for an explanation. Some are, hilarious, trying to blame global warming but the fact is, their predictions for Antarctica were as wrong as they could possibly be. Instead of melting as forecasted, ice levels are surging to new and unprecedented heights. If both poles are considered together, there is about one million square kilometres of frozen area above and beyond the long-term average. 　 Even UN warming alarmists have been forced to concede that they do not know what is going on or why their “climate models” that predicted melting have been proven so wildly off the mark. “There is low confidence in the scientific understanding of the observed increase in Antarctic sea ice extent since 1979, due to … incomplete and competing scientific explanations for the causes of change,” the IPCC admitted in its report. The warming alarmists have been trying their best to keep the public from noticing or examining the growth in Antarctic ice. 　 To punctuate the idiocy, in December 3013, a ship full of global-warming alarmists led by a “climate scientist” went on a mission to study how “global warming” was melting Antarctic ice. Instead of completing their mission, they ended up getting their vessel trapped in record-setting levels of sea ice. A Chinese rescue ship was then stuck in the ice while going to their rescue & they ended up having to be airlifted out by helicopter.",UCIt_7AOwyTvX0TdcOC-c1fQ,1,Uggwv66qqiEbI3gCoAEC,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

Contrary to the predictions by Gore and fellow cultists, satellite data showed that Arctic ice volume as of summer of 2013 had actually expanded more than 50 percent over 2012 levels. In fact, during October 2013, sea-ice levels grew at the fastest pace since records began in 1979. Many experts now predict the ongoing expansion of Arctic ice to continue in the years to come, leaving global-warming alarmists scrambling for explanations to save face and to revive the rapidly melting climate hysteria. National Geographic, for example, has released an atlas which shows arctic ice covering to be half of what it actually is. I guess their philosophy is when predictions don’t match reality, just lie. 　 Gore, though, was hardly alone in making the ridiculous and thoroughly discredited predictions about Arctic ice. Citing “climate experts“, the British government-funded BBC also hyped the mass hysteria, running a now-embarrassing article on December 12, 2007, with the headline: “Arctic summers ice-free ‘by 2013’.” In that piece the BBC highlighted alleged “modeling studies” that “indicate northern polar waters could be ice-free in summers within just 5-6 years.” Incredibly, some of the “experts” even claimed it could happen before then, citing calculations performed by “super computers” that the BBC noted have “become a standard part of climate science in recent years.” 　 “Our projection of 2013 for the removal of ice in summer is not accounting for the last two minima, in 2005 and 2007,” stated Professor Wieslaw Maslowski, described as a researcher from the Naval Postgraduate School who was working with co-workers at NASA to come up with the now-thoroughly discredited forecasts about polar ice. “So given that fact, you can argue that may be [sic] our projection of 2013 is already too conservative.” Other “experts” quoted in the BBC article agreed with the warming hysteria. 　 Reality just doesn’t seem to want to go along with theories advanced by Gore, the UN, and government-funded “climate scientists.” In the Arctic data collected by Europe’s Cryosat spacecraft pointed to about 9,000 cubic kilometres of ice volume at the end of the 2013 melt season. In 2012, which was admittedly a low year, the total volume was about 6,000 cubic kilometres. In 2007, when Gore and others started making their predictions about “ice-free” Arctic summers, the average sea-ice area extent after the summer melt for the month of September was 4.28 million square kilometres. By 2013, even on September 13, (the minimum ice-cover day for the whole year) ice levels were way above the 2007 average for the month (by an area about the size of California.) The lowest level recorded on a single day during 2013 was 5.1 million square kilometres. By late July 2014, Arctic sea-ice extent was almost at its highest level in a decade. Despite parroting the wild claims five years ago, the mainstream media has refused to report that Gore and his fellow alarmists were proven embarrassingly wrong. No apologies from Gore have been forthcoming & none of the “scientists” who made the ridiculous predictions quoted by the BBC has apologized or lost his taxpayer-funded job. Instead, the mainstream media is parroting new claims from the same discredited “experts” suggesting that the Arctic will be “ice-free” by 2016. 　",UCIt_7AOwyTvX0TdcOC-c1fQ,1,Uggwv66qqiEbI3gCoAEC,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

Now global-warming alarmists rushed to blame the record cold and heavy snow experienced in recent years on, (can you guess) that’s right, global warming. Less snow: global warming. More snow: global warming. Lose your keys: global warming. Get cut off in traffic: global warming. As record cold and snowfall was pummeling much of North America, warming theorists contradicted all of their previous forecasts and claimed that global warming was somehow to blame. Among them: White House Science “Czar” John Holdren. “A growing body of evidence suggests that the kind of extreme cold being experienced by much of the United States as we speak is a pattern we can expect to see with increasing frequency, as global warming continues,” he claimed. (It should be noted that Holdren was once an outspoken global cooling alarmist, predicting a coming ice age by 2020.) That assertion, of course, is exactly the opposite of what the IPCC predicted in its 2001 global warming report, which claimed that the planet would see “warmer winters and fewer cold spells, because of climate change.” 　 Ridiculous forecasts have been made by other “climate scientists” who, like Holdren, continue to reap huge amounts of taxpayer dollars in salaries, grants, and benefits despite being consistently wrong. James Hansen, for instance, who headed NASA’s Goddard Institute for three decades before taking a post at Columbia University, is one of the best known “climatologists” in the world despite his long and embarrassing record of bad forecasting spanning over decades. In 1988 Hansen was asked by journalist and author Rob Reiss how the “greenhouse effect” would affect the neighbourhood outside his window within 20 years (by 2008). “The West Side Highway [which runs along the Hudson River] will be under water,” claimed Hansen. “And there will be tape across the windows across the street because of high winds. And the same birds won’t be there. The trees in the median strip will change.... There will be more police cars … [since] you know what happens to crime when the heat goes up.” In 1986, Hansen also predicted in congressional testimony that the Earth would be some two degrees warmer within 20 years. In recent years, after the anticipated warming failed to materialize, alarmists have somewhat cooled on predicting such a dramatic jump in temperature over such a short period of time. 　 Another prominent alarmist, Princeton professor and lead UN IPCC author Michael Oppenheimer, made some dramatic predictions in 1990 while working as “chief scientist” for the Environmental Defence Fund. By 1995, he claimed, the “greenhouse effect” would be “desolating the heartlands of North America and Eurasia with horrific drought, causing crop failures and food riots.” By 1996, he added, the Platte River of Nebraska “would be dry, while a continent-wide black blizzard of prairie topsoil will stop traffic on interstates, strip paint from houses and shut down computers.” The situation would get so bad that “Mexican police will round up illegal American migrants surging into Mexico seeking work as field hands.” 　 When confronted on his failed predictions, Oppenheimer (who also served as Al Gore’s advisor) refused to apologize. “On the whole I would stand by these predictions ….. not predictions, sorry, scenarios ….. as having at least in a general way actually come true,” he claimed. “There’s been extensive drought, devastating drought, in significant parts of the world. The fraction of the world that’s in drought has increased over that period.” Unfortunately for Oppenheimer, even his fellow alarmists debunked that claim in a 2012 study for Nature, pointing out that there has been “little change in global drought over the past 60 years.”",UCIt_7AOwyTvX0TdcOC-c1fQ,1,Uggwv66qqiEbI3gCoAEC,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

So if a newspaper or magazine quotes one of these brilliant idiots we can discount what they said because it's not a scientific paper? Are you really this desperate? On December 20, 2008 Obama made John Holdren his Science Czar. Holdren wrote a college text book with Paul & Anne Ehrlich - Ecoscience: Population, Resources, Environment - where they called for ""compulsory, government-mandated 'green abortions' as a constitutionally acceptable way to control population & prevent ecological disasters because the fetus was most likely not a person under the 14th Amendment.” “Compulsory birth control methods” would be allowed, including “involuntary abortions, government-imposed sterilizations & laws limiting the number of children permitted to be born, as steps justified under the banner of ‘sustainable well-being.’” They went on to suggest that ‘population control measures could be used against welfare recipients & that involuntary birth control measures, including forced sterilizations, may be necessary & morally acceptable under extreme conditions, such as widespread famine brought about by climate change. They went on to say that if unwed women are unwilling to submit to government-mandated abortions, (pro-choice?) then the “illegitimate children” could be taken by the government & put up for adoption. When climate-gate erupted, e-mails from the Climate Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia showed Holdren to be directly involved in the CRU’s unfolding scandal.

In 2008, perfectly timed for a “global warming” legislation debate in Parliament, London saw its first October snow since 1934. According to the U.K. Register. “It is unusual to have snow this early,” a spokesperson for the alarmist U.K. Met office admitted to The Guardian newspaper. By December of 2009, London saw its heaviest levels of snowfall in two decades. In 2010, the coldest U.K. winter since records began a century ago blanketed the islands with snow. 　 In early 2004, the CRU’s Viner and other “experts” warned that skiing in Scotland would soon become just a memory, due to global warming. “Unfortunately, it’s just getting too hot for the Scottish ski industry,” Viner told The Guardian. Another “expert,” Adam Watson with the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, told the paper that the skiing industry in Scotland had less than two decades left to go. Yet in 2013, too much snow kept many Scottish resorts closed. “Nevis Range, The Lecht, Cairngorm, Glenshee and Glencoe all remain closed today due to the heavy snow,” reported OnTheSnow.com on January 4, 2013. Ironically, by 2014, the BBC, citing experts, reported that the Scottish hills had more snow than at any point in seven decades. It also reported that the Nevis Range ski resort could not operate some of its lifts because they were “still buried under unprecedented amounts of snow.” 　 The IPCC’s 2001 Third Assessment Report claimed “milder winter temperatures will decrease heavy snowstorms.” Again, though, the climate refused to cooperate. The year 2013, the last year for which complete data is available, featured the fourth-highest levels on record, (according to data from Rutgers University’s Global Snow Lab.) Spring snow cover was the highest in a decade, while data for the fall indicate that it was the fifth highest ever recorded. December of that year brought with it a new high record in Northern Hemisphere snow cover, Global Snow Lab data show.

In a handy map, the organization highlighted areas that were supposed to be particularly vulnerable in terms of producing “climate refugees.” Especially at risk were low lying regions such as the Caribbean, Pacific islands & various coastal areas. 　 The 2005 UNEP predictions claimed that, by 2010, some 50 million “climate refugees” would be frantically fleeing from those regions of the globe. Not only did the areas in question fail to produce a single “climate refugee,” by 2010, population levels for those regions were actually still rising. In many cases, the areas that were supposed to be producing waves of “climate refugees” and becoming uninhabitable turned out to be among the fastest-growing places on Earth. 　 The Bahamas, for example, according to the 2010 census, had it’s population go from around 300,000 in 2000 to more than 350,000 by 2010. The population of St. Lucia grew by five percent during the same period. The Seychelles grew by about 10 percent. The Solomon Islands gained another 100,000 people (or a 25% increase.) In China the top six fastest growing cities were all within the areas highlighted by the UN as likely sources of “climate refugees.” Many of the fastest-growing U.S. cities were also within or close to “climate refugee” danger zones touted by the UN. 　 Rather than apologize for its undisputable mistake, they responded in typical alarmist fashion: with a cover up seeking to erase all evidence of its ridiculous predictions. First, the UNEP took its “climate refugees” map down from the Web. That failed, of course, because the content was archived online prior to its disappearance down the UN memory hole. Then the UNEP tried and failed to distance itself from the outlandish claims, despite the fact that the map was created by a UNEP cartographer, released by UNEP, and repeatedly hyped by the outfit in its scaremongering campaigns. Eventually, as more and more media around the world began picking up the story, a spokesperson for the UN agency claimed the map was removed because it was “causing confusion.” 　 It was far from the first time UN bureaucrats had made such dire predictions, only to be proven wrong. On June 30, 1989, the Associated Press ran an article headlined: “UN Official Predicts Disaster, Says Greenhouse Effect Could Wipe Some Nations Off Map.” In the article, the director of the UNEP’s New York office was quoted as claiming that “entire nations could be wiped off the face of the earth by rising sea levels if global warming is not reversed by the year 2000.” He also predicted “coastal flooding and crop failures” that “would create an exodus of ‘eco-refugees,’ threatening political chaos.” Other UN predictions were so ridiculous that they were retracted before they could even be proven wrong. A good example would become known as “Glaciergate.” In its final 2007 report, widely considered the “gospel” of “settled” climate “science,” the UN IPCC suggested that Himalayan glaciers could melt by 2035 or sooner. This idiotic prediction was lifted from World Wildlife Fund propaganda literature. The IPCC recanted the claim after initially defending it & you sometimes still here it mentioned by unfortunate warming zealots from time to time as they proceed to shoot themselves in the foot with UN supplied, crap filled bullets.",UCIt_7AOwyTvX0TdcOC-c1fQ,1,Uggwv66qqiEbI3gCoAEC,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

Don't bother answering (or do - makes no difference) I stopped reading your crap long ago. Anyone who lived through the ‘60s and ’70s may remember the dire global-cooling predictions that were given great credibility by the likes of Newsweek, Time, Life, National Geographic, and numerous other mainstream media outlets. According to the man-made global-cooling theories of the time, billions of people should be dead by now due to cooling-linked crop failures and starvation. According to ecology professor Kenneth E.F. Watt at the University of California in 1970, “If present trends continue, the world will be about four degrees colder for the global mean temperature in 1990, but 11 degrees colder by the year 2000, this is about twice what it would take to put us in an ice age.” As we know, 2000 came and went, and the world did not get 11 degrees colder. No ice age either. In 1971, Stanford University professor Paul Ehrlich, who is perhaps best known for his 1968 book The Population Bomb, made similarly wild forecasts in a speech at the British Institute for Biology, saying “By the year 2000 the United Kingdom will be simply a small group of impoverished islands, inhabited by some 70 million hungry people,” he claimed. “If I were a gambler, I would take even money that England will not exist in the year 2000 and give ten to one that the life of the average Briton would be of distinctly lower quality than it is today.” Yet England’s still with us and its population was doing much better in 2000 than when Ehrlich made his claims. But long before 2000, Ehrlich abandoned global-cooling alarmism in favour of global-warning alarmism & began preaching from the catastrophic global warming gospel. Now he is warning that humans may soon be forced to resort to cannibalism. To combat the alleged man-made cooling, “experts” suggested all sorts of bizarre schemes, including some that seem too comical to be real. In its 1975 article “The Cooling World,” Newsweek reported, “Climatologists are pessimistic that political leaders will take any positive action to compensate for the climate change, or even to allay its effects,” & claimed that Earth’s temperature had been plunging for decades due to humanity’s activities. Some of the “more spectacular solutions” proposed by the cooling theorists at the time included “melting the arctic ice cap by covering it with black soot or diverting arctic rivers,” as Newsweek reported. Of course, today it’s all about global warming, not global cooling. The accuracy of the climate-change predictions since the cooling fears melted away, however, has not improved in the least.",UCIt_7AOwyTvX0TdcOC-c1fQ,1,Uggwv66qqiEbI3gCoAEC,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

The New York Times’ headline, “EPA Emissions Plan Will Save Thousands of Lives, Study Finds,” was typical of the media coverage. The authors were described as simply university-affiliated “researchers.” The “researchers” had declared they had “no competing financial interests” in their study. Both universities had issued media releases declaring the study to be “the first independent, peer-reviewed paper of its kind.” Study co-author Charles Driscoll of Syracuse University told the Buffalo News, “I’m an academic, not a politician. I don’t have a dog in this fight.” This claim of independence was repeated by study co-author Jonathan Buonocore of Harvard University. “The EPA, which did not participate in the study or interact with its authors, Buonocore says, roundly welcomed its findings.” However, a closer look at these claims of independence raised some serious doubts. An online search of the EPA’s web site revealed that Driscoll had previously been involved as a principal investigator in studies that received over $3.6 million in research grants from the EPA. Co-author Dallas Burtraw, a researcher at the think tank Resources for the Future, had been involved in previous EPA grants totalling $2 million. Harvard co-author Jonathan I. Levy had recieved over $9.5 million worth of grants. Co-author Joel Schwartz, also of Harvard, had been involved in over $31 million worth of grants from the EPA. So researchers who had previously received some $45 million in grants from the EPA (& hoping for more in the future, no doubt) seem to have a “dog in this fight“ after all. A July 8, 2014 email shows Lambert arranging a conference call with the EPA staff to get the EPA’s input on the study. One of the EPA staff involved was the contact person for agency’s Clean Power Plan cost-benefit analysis. Another e-mail shows that the top EPA staffer on the Clean Power Plan cost-benefit analysis was added to the call. A July 15, 2014 email from Driscoll to an EPA staffer boasts of “considerable interest” in their analysis from unnamed outside “groups.” One sentence after kissing up to the EPA staffer, Driscoll asks her if they could have a phone call to discuss fundraising for a conference Driscoll is organizing. Independent study? No appearance of attempted financial conflict? A November 7, 2014 e-mail from Lambert to EPA about the study reads, “We would like to follow back up with you by phone to discuss possible next steps in this analysis and what role you might be able to play.” The EPA’s controversial Clean Power Plan hinges on the notion that shuttering coal plants will save lives. (Except, of course in China where it’s no big deal.) The EPA’s proposed global warming plan focuses on reducing carbon dioxide emissions from coal plants. But the bulk of the alleged benefits of the plan actually arise from collateral projections of lives supposedly saved by reducing coal plant emissions related to particulate matter and ozone. The EPA values each life “saved” at about $10 million, so the claim that the rules will save 6,600 lives per year puts the rules’ alleged benefits on the order of $66 billion per year, far in excess of industry projections of the rules’ costs. These EPA claims, however, are controversial to say the least. The EPA’s own extensive clinical research shows that particulate matter and ozone in outdoor air do not kill anyone.",UCIt_7AOwyTvX0TdcOC-c1fQ,1,Uggwv66qqiEbI3gCoAEC,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

Mann (from Penn State University) & Briffa (from the Climate Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia) Came up with the infamous ""hockey stick"" graph which was supposed to be ""proof"" that the ""science"" was settled. It was the centerpiece of Al Gores crockumentry. Interesting thing though, they refused to make their work available for scrutiny. You see, when a major breakthrough or discovery of this type is made, you're supposed to show how you achieved it in order to see if it stands up to scrutiny & is duplicable. That's how science works. They refused, despite repeated freedom of information requests on both sides of the Atlantic. They also pressured scientific journals too keep out the work of skeptics. Where were their peers? If there was any real science being done here there would have at least been an investigation at this point. Nope, all just business as usual in the world of climate ""science."" After climate-gate erupted (over 2100 documents & e-mails were leaked showing that they were saying one thing publicly & quite another privately) they were finally pressured into showing their work & data sets by the Royal Society & a special investigator. Guess what? No blade on the hockey stick. They lied. If there was real science going on in the world of climate ""science"" that would have been the end of them. Their work, their data, their lie. Their careers would have been over right there. But not in the world of climate science. They were cleared of all wrongdoing. You get that? Unlike in real science, with climate ""science"" you can withhold your data, smear critics, pressure scientific journals to keep out the work of skeptics, get caught doing the most unscientific activities, be found out to be a total & utter fraud & yet still be cleared of any wrongdoing. Since then, the world of climate ""science"" has been feeding us nothing but lies, half-truths & manipulated data. Disappearing arctic ice that fails repeatedly disappear on one predicted date after another & continues to disappear even though satellite photos show record growth. The vanishing polar bears who's numbers continue to rise as they're supposedly dwindling. Decades of alarming ocean level rise that never produces the massive global coastal flooding that should have happened many years ago. The tens of millions of ""climate refugees"" that failed to materialize in 2012. NOAA deciding they can simply change climate history by rewriting the data, despite their revised data contradicting all other data sets. 2014 the hottest year on record turns out to (as stated in their own report) be only 38% likely of being the warmest on record (& even then depending on highly questionable surface data.)

Have you ever heard of John Cook, the creator of that blog? Who is John Cook? John Cook is an evangelical Christian (aren’t skeptics often referred to as “creationists?” How would a skeptic be treated if they were so much as accused of being an evangelical Christian?) from who we find, from his original introduction of himself in 2007, that his qualification was that he did some physics at the University of Queensland, didn’t get his Ph.D. & was a “self employed cartoonist” by trade. His motivation came from Al Gores failed crockumentary - “An Inconvenient Truth” & he sees himself as being Jack Bauer, out to save the world. (Some might refer to this as delusional.) From the original 2007 intro posted at Skeptical Science:   “This site was created by John Cook. I'm not a climatologist or a scientist but a self employed cartoonist and web programmer by trade. I did a Physics degree at the University of Queensland and while I achieved First Class Honours and could've continued onto a PhD, I instead quit academia and became a professional scrawler. Too much doodling in lectures, I think. Nevertheless, I've pursued a keen interest in science and if anything, found my curiosity about how the world works increased once I wasn't forced to study for impending exams. My interest in global warming began when I drew a cartoon spoof of the TV show 24 that wondered what Jack Bauer would do if Al Gore was President and Global Warming was the “Threat du jour”. I watched An Inconvenient Truth for research which I found thought provoking although I didn't know what to make of all the science."" Names of deniers? Oh, you mean skeptics. It's you clowns that are in denial here - as the ""proven science"" falls apart. Here are some lists of skeptics: http://notrickszone.com/2012/04/10/50-top-astronauts-scientists-engineers-sign-letter-claiming-giss-is-turning-nasa-into-a-laughing-stock/#sthash.fJtY8XXD.dpbs http://www.climatedepot.com/2010/12/08/special-report-more-than-1000-international-scientists-dissent-over-manmade-global-warming-claims-challenge-un-ipcc-gore-2/ http://www.petitionproject.org/ The petition project in particular caused warming alarmists to go into hysterics - including the clowns at skeptical science (though it's their natural state.) Ah, yes. All skepticism is funded by the fossil fuel industry. (The mantra of skeptical science.) Environmental mega-donor Tom Steyer spent more than $70 million in 2014 trying to defeat GOP climate skeptics, mostly in a losing effort. Now Steyer is promising to spend big to make Republicans pay a political price for denying the reality of man-made climate change in 2016. The Washington Spectator reported in 2013 that while Steyer was senior managing partner at Farallon Capital Management (a post he held until 2012) the firm had $440 million worth of stock in oil and gas companies (about 10 percent of the company’s portfolio.) When Steyer announced that he was leaving Farallon, the San Diego Reader reported that he still had investments in several companies that provided energy from coal and oil. His company held these investments even while Steyer was campaigning against California’s Proposition 23, which would have suspended California’s self-imposed cap-and-trade law. Steyer claimed that he left Farallon because he had been uncomfortable with the company’s investment in fossil fuels; but he is comfortable using the money from fossil fuel investments to get rich & campaign against oil. According to the Washington Post the green group Nature Conservancy (which encourages citizens to personally pledge to fight climate change - ""has accepted nearly $10 million in cash and land contributions from BP and affiliated corporations over the years."" But that's just the beginning. Conservation International, another green group which insists climate change represents a “profound threat” accepted $2 million in donations from BP over the years and partnered with the company on a number of projects. BP is also funding research into ""ways of tackling the world's climate problem"" at Princeton University to the tune of $2 million / year over 15 years. BP is funding an energy research institute involving two other US universities to the tune of $500 million (the aim of which is ""to develop new sources of energy and reduce the impact of energy consumption on the environment."") ExxonMobil itself has donated $100 million to Stanford university so that researchers there can find ""ways to meet growing energy needs without worsening global warming."" That‘ $642 million right there. 　 Multi-billionaire, socialist, media baron, AGW alarmist funder, George Soros has invested almost $900 million into Brazilian oil giant Petrobras, which is currently going ahead with plans for offshore oil drilling. The Obama administration has worked hard over the years to ban US companies from drilling offshore (for the good of the environment, of course) yet offered Petrobras $2 billion in loans (of course the administration claimed it was all the work of the import-export bank, Obama was powerless to stop it & was only in Brazil at the time by shear coincidence. - the “I didn’t know about it until I saw it on TV” - innocence through incompetence defence.) Screwing over taxpayers for countless billions of dollars just doesn't cut it for the warming alarmists I guess. Oh, & you end with your little graph.

I am somewhat at a loss to understand why. It is clear from the emails that this relates to the emphasis placed on a few words or phrases in Keith’s and Tim’s Science paper. These may not be fully resolved but the paper comes out tomorrow. I don’t want to open more wounds but I might by the end of the email.” As we shall see, Mike Mann does not tolerate any criticism - no matter how mild, even if it comes from his own colleagues; and he does everything within his power to prevent the publication of any such criticisms. In this case, it seems that he has failed. In defence of his team, Jones raises an issue that recurs throughout the Climategate saga: “You may think Keith or I have reviewed some of your papers but we haven’t. I’ve reviewed Ray’s and Malcolm’s—constructively, I hope, where I thought something could have been done better. I also know you’ve reviewed my paper with Gabi Hegerl very constructively.”   This is a remarkable discussion for two senior scientists to be having. The “peer review” process for papers submitted to academic journals is, in general, completely anonymous, for the same reason that voting at elections is anonymous: to prevent intimidation or bullying. For these scientists to be surreptitiously trying to determine who the reviewers of their papers are immediately tells us two things: that the practitioners have no respect for the principles of scientific integrity and objectivity; and that this “discipline of science” has such a small and exclusive membership that they are able to guess at the names of their reviewers by a simple process of elimination. Jones tries to heal over the rift, but then proceeds to back up the statements of his colleagues: “There are two things I’m going to say though: 1) Keith didn’t mention in his Science piece but both of us think that you’re on very dodgy ground with this long-term decline in temperatures on the 1000 year timescale. … 2) The errors don’t include all the possible factors. …” Scientific disagreement is absolutely normal and healthy; that is not the point of this exchange. Rather, it is Jones’s feeling the need to justify the criticisms being published by his staff - and to assert, unequivocally, that he agrees with and supports those criticisms - that is of real concern. Presumably, if Jones had not agreed with them, then Mann’s attempt to have the criticisms suppressed might well have been successful. In other words, these two men—Mike Mann and Phil Jones - essentially controlled what could and could not be published in the scientific literature relating to their field. This is an extremely dangerous concentration of power for any discipline, let alone a field possessing such enormous political and financial ramifications.",UCIt_7AOwyTvX0TdcOC-c1fQ,1,Uggwv66qqiEbI3gCoAEC,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

Not only do I disagree with the content of this letter, but I also believe that you have severely distorted the IPCC “view” when you 9 say that “the latest IPCC assessment makes a convincing economic case for immediate control of emissions.” … This is a complex issue, and your misrepresentation of it does you a disservice. To someone like me, who knows the science, it is apparent that you are presenting a personal view, not an informed, balanced scientific assessment. What is unfortunate is that this will not be apparent to the vast majority of scientists you have contacted. In issues like this, scientists have an added responsibility to keep their personal views separate from the science, and to make it clear to others when they diverge from the objectivity they (hopefully) adhere to in their scientific research. I think you have failed to do this. Your approach of trying to gain scientific credibility for your personal views by asking people to endorse your letter is reprehensible. No scientist who wishes to maintain respect in the community should ever endorse any statement unless they have examined the issue fully themselves. You are asking people to prostitute themselves by doing just this! I fear that some will endorse your letter, in the mistaken belief that you are making a balanced and knowledgeable assessment of the science—when, in fact, you are presenting a flawed view that neither accords with the IPCC nor with the bulk of the scientific and economic literature on the subject. … When scientists color the science with their own personal views or make categorical statements without presenting the evidence for such statements, they have a clear responsibility to state that that is what they are doing. You have failed to do so. Indeed, what you are doing is, in my view, a form of dishonesty more subtle but no less egregious than the statements made by the greenhouse skeptics ….

I would like to weigh in on two important questions— Distribution for Endorsements— I am very strongly in favor of as wide and rapid a distribution as possible for endorsements. I think the only thing that counts is numbers. The media is going to say “1000 scientists signed” or “1500 signed”. No one is going to check if it is 600 with PhDs versus 2000 without. They will mention the prominent ones, but that is a different story.” This statement alone shows how ridiculous the “endorsement” process was from the very beginning. Alcamo continues: “Timing—I feel strongly that the week of 24 November is too late. 1. We wanted to announce the Statement in the period when there was a sag in related news, but in the week before Kyoto we should expect that we will have to crowd out many other articles about climate. 2. If the Statement comes out just a few days before Kyoto I am afraid that the delegates who we want to influence will not have any time to pay attention to it. We should give them a few weeks to hear about it. 3. If Greenpeace is having an event the week before, we should have it a week before them so that they and other Non-Governmental Organizations can further spread the word about the Statement. On the other hand, it wouldn’t be so bad to release the Statement in the same week, but on a different day. The media might enjoy hearing the message from two very different directions. Conclusion I suggest the week of 10 November, or the week of 17 November at the latest.” Alcamo demonstrates that this is a carefully crafted piece of political activism, not related to the scientific process at all. Indeed, the optimization of the timing - allowing just enough time for delegates to absorb the message, but not enough time for the scientists signing on to this petition to actually examine or criticize its contents will return with a vengeance.",UCIt_7AOwyTvX0TdcOC-c1fQ,1,Uggwv66qqiEbI3gCoAEC,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

I think we should have a cunning plan about what to do this year, simply to avoid a lot of wasted time.” Again, selling the public message - before the actual end of the calendar year—is of primary importance for these senior “scientists.” Jenkins goes on to explain how this “invented” data should be leaked: “We feed this selectively to Nick Nuttall (of the United Nations Environment Program) (who has had this in the past and seems now to expect special treatment) so that he can write an article for the silly season. We could also give this to Neville Nicholls (climate scientist at the Bureau of Meteorology Research Centre in Melbourne, Australia)?” Lest it be thought that this may be standard public relations procedure for the Met Office, Jenkins puts the issue beyond doubt: “I know it sound a bit cloak-and-dagger but it’s just meant to save time in the long run.” In other words, Jenkins was more interested in getting “headline” numbers out to the general public, than in ensuring an impartial release of information to all members of the press at the same time.",UCIt_7AOwyTvX0TdcOC-c1fQ,1,Uggwv66qqiEbI3gCoAEC,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

Of course politics and “spin doctoring” outweighs the scientific issues.: “For his day job he teaches physics and astronomy at a University and he predicts the weather from solar phenomena.” “He’s not all bad as he doesn’t have much confidence in nuclear-power safety.” Here we clearly see that Jones’s assessment of a scientist’s worth is influenced by his assessment of his or her ideology.

His motivation came from Al Gores failed crockumentary - “An Inconvenient Truth” & he sees himself as being Jack Bauer, out to save the world. (Some might refer to this as delusional.) From the original 2007 intro posted at Skeptical Science: “This site was created by John Cook. I'm not a climatologist or a scientist but a self employed cartoonist and web programmer by trade. I did a Physics degree at the University of Queensland and while I achieved First Class Honours and could've continued onto a PhD, I instead quit academia and became a professional scrawler. Too much doodling in lectures, I think. Nevertheless, I've pursued a keen interest in science and if anything, found my curiosity about how the world works increased once I wasn't forced to study for impending exams. My interest in global warming began when I drew a cartoon spoof of the TV show 24 that wondered what Jack Bauer would do if Al Gore was President and Global Warming was the “Threat du jour”. I watched An Inconvenient Truth for research which I found thought provoking although I didn't know what to make of all the science."" Yup, that's you source. At least you're consistently pathetic. Cook et al came up with the fraudulent 97% consensus crock that ended up showing that there was almost no support at all for the IPCC / alarmist position on AGW (0.3% actually.)

He was 100% right but, hey, if an allegation is made that he had a connection to ""big oil"" then you don't have to deal with it. Pathetic. In the meantime we have events such as the following: In early May, 2015, a study published in the journal Nature Climate Change purported to support a key EPA claim about its coming global warming rules aimed at coal-fired power plants. The authors were described as simply university-affiliated “researchers.” The “researchers” had declared they had “no competing financial interests” in their study. Both universities had issued media releases declaring the study to be the “first independent, peer-reviewed paper of its kind.” Study co-author Charles Driscoll of Syracuse University told the Buffalo News, “I’m an academic, not a politician. I don’t have a dog in this fight.” The claim of independence was repeated by study co-author Jonathan Buonocore of Harvard University. “The EPA, which did not participate in the study or interact with its authors, Buonocore says, roundly welcomed its findings.” But a closer look raises serious doubts. An online search of EPA’s web site revealed that Syracuse’s Driscoll has previously involved as a principal investigator in studies that received over $3.6 million in research grants from EPA. Co-author Dallas Burtraw, a researcher at the think tank Resources for the Future, had been involved in previous EPA grants totaling almost $2 million. Harvard co-author Jonathan I. Levy had been involved in over $9.5 million worth of grants. Co-author Joel Schwartz, also of Harvard, had been previously involved in over $31 million worth of grants from EPA. So researchers who had previously received some $45 million in grants from EPA (& hoping for more in the future) seem to have a “dog in this fight“ after all. A July 8, 2014 e-mail shows Lambert arranging a conference call with EPA staff to get EPA’s input on the study. One of the EPA staff involved was the contact person for agency’s Clean Power Plan cost-benefit analysis. A subsequent e-mail shows that the top EPA staffer on the Clean Power Plan cost-benefit analysis was added to the call. A July 15, 2014 email from Driscoll to an EPA staffer boasts of “considerable interest” in their analysis from unnamed outside “groups.” One sentence after buttering up the EPA staffer, Driscoll asks her if they could have a phone call to discuss fundraising for a conference Driscoll is organizing. Independent study? No appearance of attempted financial conflict? A November 7, 2014 e-mail from Lambert to EPA about the study reads, “We would like to follow back up with you by phone to discuss possible next steps in this analysis and what role you might be able to play.” The EPA’s controversial Clean Power Plan hinges on the notion that shuttering coal plants will save lives. (Except, of course in China where it’s no big deal.) The EPA’s proposed global warming plan focuses on reducing carbon dioxide emissions from coal plants. But the bulk of the alleged benefits of the plan actually arise from collateral projections of lives supposedly saved by reducing coal plant emissions related to particulate matter and ozone. The EPA values each life “saved” at about $10 million, the claim that the rules will save 6,600 lives per year puts the rules’ alleged benefits at about $66 billion per year, far in excess of industry projections of the rules’ costs. An alternate view is that no lives will be saved because the EPA’s own extensive clinical research shows that particulate matter and ozone in outdoor air do not kill anyone.

Even when sea water is completely saturated in CO2 (which can happen over volcanic vents) it never becomes acidic. We're supposed to believe in the false pictures they're painting here of oceans turning into vast vats of bubbling acid. We're also supposed to ignore basic natural laws. Previously it was the law of thermodynamics. This time it's Henry's law. The foundation of this hoax comes from, you guessed it, NOAA. This recent NOAA data manipulation comes from a grand total of 4 ocean stations. I did mention that the posting I listed came from your fellow AGW alarmists. Did you miss that? We were told that deforestation was killing the planet & then satellite data showed us otherwise - so they had to find an AGW alarmist response. And no, they mention China as contributing to it, not being the major factor in it. (China does what's in China's interest, btw. Nothing more.) No comment on the Kyoto accord & sudden lack of interest among ""environmentalists"" & AGW alarmists regarding deforestation, I noticed. Buying into AGW alarmism & then deciding you're not one is bizarre to say the least. Who do you think is saying that human activity is causing these ""serious problems?""

It gradually changes. http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/ The picture in that article was so misleading I almost vomited. That is a terrible source of information.

Probably does no good for the algae either which also produces a ton of oxygen, and gets rid of CO2. But, you probably knew that I assume.  And what I read from the vegetation article from Nat Geo, is that some areas have grown more vegetation. Okay? The amazon basin is growing 47% of that increase apparently. And the other article says it is mostly due to China mass planting trees. It also says that mass deforestation is still happening.

The ""articles"" you mentioned come from NASA's own report. Are you telling me that you buy what NASA's selling you on blind faith & then demand evidence when someone tells you otherwise? The climate has been changing as long as the Earth has had a climate to change. That's not the issue here. If all you wanted was for me to agree that the Earth's climate changes, then we're done - mission accomplished. But that's not the issue here. the issue here is the impact that humans are having on the climate.

What we're being told now about ocean warming comes from (directly or indirectly) NOAA & their creative use of warming data. Yes, in the world of climate ""science"" the surface of the oceans can warm up without warming the air above it or the water below it, laws of thermodynamics be damned. Again, most scientists believe that humans have some impact to play in the climate. Many believe that the impact of human activity is real but unknown. Many other's believe that the impact is real but negligible & possibly even beneficial. It's been estimated that about 3% believe we're having no impact at all. Even that 3% is a far greater number than those who buy into the IPCC alarmist position. An interesting stand on deforestation. When the Kyoto accord was being pushed, ""environmentalists"" & AGW alarmists seemed to forget all about this issue. Punish Western industry for the sin of producing carbon & exempt 80% of the rest of the planet (allowing those ""deadly"" carbon emissions to rise - which they have) - including every single OPEC nation (which combined represented the 4th largest carbon emitter) as well as Brazil & Indonesia where the most sever deforestation is occurring. Maybe because they don't believe their own talking points?

This destroys oceans habitats and forces fish to migrate. The global temperature is rising and the polar ice caps are melting.  Also, you will notice the sheer amount of people who say that AGW is not caused by humans is near naught.

They ignored their own satellite data (which showed no warming at all) & went with highly questionable surface data (they had no temperature station in Greenland in December, for one example, & decided to show it as being much warmer than average.) Of course, since then NOAA has decided that they could simply revise climate history & eliminate the almost 20 year pause that way. Of course this means their data fails to line up with anyone else's & once again ignores satellite data as well. No problem though, NOA has a long history of making wild claims to the news media & then quietly backing away from them later on. With the coming IPCC circus in Paris at the end of the year I'm sure we'll see a lot of fraudulent record breaking warming leading up to it.

Working with incorrect data is business as usual for the pseudoscience of climate change. Do you really think you can revise the history here? Just about every major publication at that time carried stories about the coming ice age & the first Earth Day was well publicized. Did all scientists predict global cooling? Nope, just the vocal minority that got all the media attention & then, when it was obvious that the climate was warming, (it's pretty much always going to do one or the other) they simply switched gears & became global warming alarmists & started spewing the same doomsday garbage (that also never happened.) Do you need an example of one of these scientists? How about a recap: On December 20, 2008 Obama made John Holdren his Science Czar. Holdren wrote a college text book with Paul & Anne Ehrlich - Ecoscience: Population, Resources, Environment - where they called for “compulsory, government-mandated ‘green abortions’ as a constitutionally acceptable way to control population & prevent ecological disasters because the fetus was most likely not a person under the 14th Amendment.” “Compulsory birth control methods” would be allowed, including “involuntary abortions, government-imposed sterilizations & laws limiting the number of children permitted to be born, as steps justified under the banner of ‘sustainable well-being.’” They went on to suggest that ‘population control measures could be used against welfare recipients & that involuntary birth control measures, including forced sterilizations, may be necessary & morally acceptable under extreme conditions, such as widespread famine brought about by climate change. They went on to say that if unwed women are unwilling to submit to government-mandated abortions, (pro-choice?) then the “illegitimate children” could be taken by the government & put up for adoption. Since then, Holdren has become a dedicated warming alarmist. When climate-gate erupted, e-mails from the Climate Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia showed Holdren to be directly involved in the CRU’s unfolding scandal. I’m sure it’s all innocent though, right? It’s not like the anthropogenic global warming (AGW) industry is being driven by a political agenda that’s so disgusting that they have to hide it, right? You say the book was only an innocent ""what if"" yet you don't explain how he was predicting the coming disaster that this ""what if"" is in reference to. They were preaching doomsday & touting draconian government overreach as the answer. Don't give me this crap about it all being innocent. BTW - The Senate was dominated by the Democrats in 2008 so trying to cover Obama's butt by pinning it on the Senate won't quite fly either. Obama nominated him & the Senate approved it. So what are these new & improved current models? Mann & Briffa come up with their phoney hockey stick graph, refuse to make their work available for scrutiny (despite repeated freedom of information requests), smear skeptics & act in a very non-scientific manner - then climate-gate erupts, 2100 documents & e-mails are leaked (showing them & their pals are saying publicly was quite different than what they were saying privately) &, when forced to finally release their work we find no blade on the hockey stick graph. They lied. Of course they were then cleared of any wrongdoing because this is standard behaviour in the climate fraud industry. If there was real science being done here their careers would be over. Need something more recent? How about the ""2014 was the warmest year on record"" nonsense that was released recently? The headline was released to great fanfare but what was kept quiet is that the report from NOAA & NASA showed that the 0.02 degree C warming came with a margin of error of 0.1 degree C & there was only a 38% chance that the warming had happened at all. There were also some issues with their questionable data gathering & the fact that their own satellites showed no warming again (almost 2 decades with no warming at this point.) I could go on & on but the bottom line is that with all of the failed doomsday predictions, manipulation of data, half-truths & outright lies coming from AGW alarmists, you have to be completely uninformed or have the blind faith of a cultist to buy into any of it.",UCIt_7AOwyTvX0TdcOC-c1fQ,1,Uggwv66qqiEbI3gCoAEC,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

Looking at the temperature data from that time period does not demonstrate any noticeable cooling shift....so even if he did say that, he was obviously working with incorrect data. None of these quotes have any relevant use in understanding this video, nor in analyzing the potential causality of human activities and global warming. You're just trying to associate them with the broader concept of global warming in order to create a false rhetorical association that they are representative of the current models, and/or that it's the same people who are determined to cry wolf. Holdren's book was written specifically under the hypothetical circumstance that ""the population crisis became sufficiently severe to endanger society""(direct quote). They don't actually advocate it. They're simply discussing all the possible responses and their implications.

Oh, but it gets better - they went on to say that if unwed women are unwilling to submit to government-mandated abortions, (pro-choice?) then the “illegitimate children” could be taken by the government & put up for adoption.

There are a near infinite amount of variables in the system (this is climate), and depending on what you are using for your model, what temperature data, what profiles, etc, you can get a fairly wide reaching result. This is why ""weather"" reports have variability. Each uses their own model, but they generally come to the same conclusion as they use similar methods. Predicting the exact climate 200 years from now is nearly impossible, but we can give fairly educated estimates... I.e. it is probable that july will be warmer than January in the northern hemisphere.... not really a shocker on that one. Its similar to the assertion that if we increase global carbon dioxide concentrations, the amount of solar outflux will decrease and thus will result in a net warming of the planet.

For instance, what scientist wouldn’t want to work in a field where he could help Save the Earth? These are some of the factors that have led climate scientists to accept a manmade explanation for climate change too readily and too uncritically. In short, the issue of global warming involves scientists and politicians who all have a vested interest in the consensus being correct. This has led to a research environment that is incentivized to avoid any lines of research that might cast doubt on the idea of humanity as the primary cause of global warming. Am I saying that the funding of global warming research is a bad idea? No. I think we have much more to fear from natural climate change than from anthropogenic change, and that is just as worthy of study. But global warming research unavoidably involves the creation of bureaucratic and scientific infrastructures and constituencies whose number-one job is to keep research funds flowing. There is a built-in bias to keep the threat of manmade global warming alive for as long as possible. The result is not so much a conspiracy as it is a mindset that prevents scientists from being as objective and thorough as they might otherwise be."".",UCua_tqVQ7kgLSf1Tfg6EkfA,1,UgjbFUw15LAWu3gCoAEC,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

""because I understand the impossibility of epic conspiracies"" - you're right, while there are numerous cases of scientific frauds in history it's hard to pull off something at this scale. But a conspiracy nonetheless is what I'm proposing, albeit in a more ""innocent"" form. Dr Roy Spencer explains this perfectly in his book ""The Great Global Warming Blunder"": ""I do not believe that there is any widespread conspiracy among the scientists who are supporting the IPCC effort–just misguided good intentions combined with a lack of due diligence in scientific research. I’ve heard statements from scientists like, “Getting off fossil fuels is the right thing to do anyway.” While this reveals a bias, it hardly constitutes a conspiracy. But I do believe that there is a conspiracy among some politicians and some of the IPCC leaders to get international agreements to regulate greenhouse gas emissions no matter what the science says. Whether their motivations are financial or political, or they are looking for meaning in their lives, these folks seem to be hoping that humanity is in grave danger from manmade global warming. One reason why the scientific community goes along with this is that they know there is at least the possibility that dire predictions of global warming and climate change might come true. Scientific investigation always involves uncertainty, and this is especially true for climate research. A variety of dynamics have resulted in an overall lack of scientific objectivity in the climate research community. Everyone in this business has biases on the subject of global warming. The bias starts from the very beginning with congressional funding of scientific research. For those who think government-funded research is impartial, I can tell you from firsthand experience that it is not. In order to convince Congress to fund research into a problem, you must first convince them that a problem exists. This automatically makes manmade global warming a particularly lucrative field for funding–as long as the threat of manmade global warming continues. There are managers at NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Science Foundation, and the Department of Energy whose careers now depend on a continuous flow of research dollars through them to the science community. As research programs are built and careers established, an entrenched scientific constituency develops. Scientists have to support their families, and the older we get, the more difficult it is to change fields of research. Note that I include myself in this group, since my research is funded entirely by the U.S. government. Then there are the huge political implications of mankind being in control of the climate system. Political power derives mostly from control over the public purse, so the global warming issue is perfect for those whose careers depend on deciding how our tax dollars should be spent. And since everything we do requires energy, whoever controls the world’s energy supply controls the world. There is also the arranged marriage between politics and science, something that would not have come about naturally. The IPCC was formed over twenty years ago largely for political reasons: to build the scientific case that mankind causes global warming, and thus the policy case for regulating carbon dioxide emissions. Because almost all options for tackling global warming involve more governmental control over society, a political bias ends up coloring the IPCC leadership’s message in a way that minimizes scientific uncertainties and maximizes public alarm. While many people in government are true public servants, dedicated to improving others’ lives and not just their own, plenty of them are also bent on increasing their own power and wealth, and they see the expansion of government control over our lives as a means to that end. Controlling energy use would be an enormous expansion of government power, so these people pursue it not just for scientific reasons but also for self-advancement...""",UCua_tqVQ7kgLSf1Tfg6EkfA,1,UgjbFUw15LAWu3gCoAEC,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

For example, Richard Klein, at the tender age of 25, was already a lead author for 6 IPCC reports since 1994. That's almost a decade prior to the completion of his PhD.

The reason they don't is because they're uninformed, and because the business sector lobbies the government, which people like KarasekUS feel is an extension of their free speech and liberty. But we the people by our constitution have a right to stop it. We just don't. ""It is the federal reserve and certain corporations and certain banks that have the final say in government."" - The federal reserve at the end of the day is accountable to the people. It's up to electorate to demand accountability of the Fed and any business entity operating on our soil. It's also up to the electorate to educate ourselves to the realities of our civic rights to demand that accountability. But to argue giving business complete autonomy will remove any ability we have at using the government to curtail harmful influences. So if your argument is remove government since it's being brought and sold so that the buyers can have complete reign, I find that to be the ultimate form of capitulation, which is the anarcho-capitalist principle.

That's what some leftists advocate, arguing that people have no free will, because they are simply guided by a combination of blind emotions, so keeping them accountable for their actions would be a simian cruelty. In the classic view freedom is inextricably linked with responsibility for one's actions: _""volenti non fit injuria""_. So for example if you murder somebody, knowing it is punishable by a symmetric death penalty, you've voluntarily forfeited your life - because you wanted to - and simply receive justice. The difference between the left and the right is that the left advocates prevention, *taking away everybody's freedom*, regardless if they committed a crime or not, and running a totalitarian state, while the right advocates *repression*, i.e. leaving everybody alone to do whatever they please, as long as they do not interfere with freedom of others - if they do, they receive punishment adequate to their crime, i.e. *both parties receive justice*. The leftist delusion is that the state can effectively control business, either through oversight - _Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?_, or through regulations - which Hayek called _the fatal conceit_. Actually the only tool to controll business is the market - a business will only make profit if it serves the consumer, if it fulfils some need, otherwise it will go bust and that's it. But as long as there's a politician to _""controll""_ business, corporations will lobby the politician to create the exact legislation that benefits the corporation. And as for possibility of free market system, one only needs to examine facts and history to find out that last 300 years proved that socialism cannot work, while the freer the market, the less government interference, the stronger and more prosperous the economy.

First, drug lords don't have to lobby politicians to keep drugs illegal because drug prohibition benefits politicians, judges, lawyers, cops and the justice system more than anyone. However, the drug market is not a legal market and therefore, in theory, the government seeks NOT to regulate it but dismantle it (they really just tread the water to help themselves and by themselves, I mean conservatives, who are the chief group advocating drug prohibition). To legalize drugs with controls would be a form of regulation, which seems to be what you're arguing for and against. How non sequitur. If that's not confusing, what is? Also, because a group has the means/ability to disregard a regulation (which is a LAW) doesn't mean you get rid of the law. By that logic, we should abolish all laws because plenty of people have the means/ability to break different law including us. My car gives me the ability to go about 90 miles over the speed limit. Therefore should they remove the 25mph speed limit in front a school? No. In fact, I have to get my car inspected to keep up with state safety REGULATIONS. This is what I mean by how your unrestrained sense of ""I should be able to do whatever I want"" type of libertarianism is dangerous, and when applied to a financial market would send everyone into the world of Mad Max: Fury Road.

The byproduct is the NRA would no longer need to relax regulations. There would be none. Instead they'd tamper with laws that don't favor the maximization of their profits.

Capitalists say such things because they rely on myths to sustain their position in society. I will explain some things you are ignorant about. In capitalist society workers produce goods for the capitalist (factory owner, various other means of production), the factory owner, lets say, shaves of 75% (somtimes less, often much more) of the value of the product that the worker has produced. Some for overheads, most for profit. This is were a promoter of capitalism will use Bill Gates as a shining light and example of how rich capitalists do not exploit. A complete strawman fallacy equivalent to saying; honestly box's work because well....Ben was honest. Never mind the facts that Bill stole most of his best ideas and there are a great many examples of capitalist exploitation, like third world slave labor etc. Some real statistics on profit gouging are; In New York the average manufacturing workers produce $4.25 in value over and above every dollar they earn.  In Texas it is $5. In the third world it is insane.  All of Rockefeller's capital could not add anything to society, yet he makes billions of other peoples labor. Walmart are a product of the natural progression of capitalism. A success story, what all good capitalists thrive to be. The six heirs of Sam Walton have more money than the bottom 41.5% of all Americans. They were born into this and their profits increase, solely because they own capital. Their incomes rose 22% during the years 2008-12. The profiteer justifies this because s/he owns the factory and pays the bills. But the factory, the resources used to make the commodities, these also are gotten how? from labor, ""hard labor"". Essentially, you could say, that the worker is paying the capitalist a fee for using the factory. Now, it is in the capitalist's interest to earn as much profit as possible, keeping wages as low as possible, improving technologies that maybe require less paid labour, etc. So, it makes sense for the working class to at some time, organise, and claim the means of production for itself, so that the surplus value (profit) is used to benefit the class that produces it, and not a shrinking elite group that benefits from unemployment, machines, factories, technology that reduces need for paid workers etc etc.......I'm not sure why quality universal health care and education at all levels, real old age security, little or no threat of losing your home, or having your heat, water or electricity shut off is not also a good thing? And this is not to say that goods should disappear either, if people want things for themselves, wouldn't they work to create them? Would people who study computers and technology suddenly not be interested in working to develop new technology? Would existing factories that produce cell phones implode if they were collectively owned and operated? The working class is too stupid to manage time, or what? Capitalism prefers to give the surplus value to ceo's and stock holders, to have inflation gradually diminish the value of wages, to wait for the next bust that is inherent in the cycle of the market system, to have improvements in technology in some cases mean that her/his job becomes irrelevant, etc etc.﻿ Also, the USSR had unseen levels of growth for a number of years, sent the first man and woman into space, industrialised at a pace unheard of, was largely responsible for the defeat of germany in WWII just to begin to list some of what was done under ""communism"", you could also get into literacy and inclusion of women into fields such as medical science (and space, for that matter). When Russia was sold out to capitalism and corruption soured, they went from Second World to Third World overnight. ""We did not know what we had"" was the catch cry around the country. A joke circulating in Russia in 1992 went like this. Q. What did capitalism accomplish in one year that communism could not do in seventy years? A. Make communism look good. Throughout Eastern Europe and the former USSR, many tell of how Conditions were better under communism. Some quotes; ""What we already had here...we took for granted, now we realize what we lost"". ""Life was different two years ago, I was a human being"". ""Sure, I hear about the new freedom that people are enjoying in Eastern Europe. But how do you define freedom? Millions of people in Eastern Europe are now free from employment, free from safe streets, free from health care, free from social security""﻿ The reality is that the more workers in the former Soviet Union experience capitalism the less they seem to like it. By 2001 the number of people who viewed the Soviet Union in a positive light in Bulgaria increased by 26% over 1991 levels, in Latvia it increased by 15%, in Hungary 16%, in Slovakia 17%, in Slovenia, 26%, in Poland 27%, and in Romania 29%. In all these countries the majority of people held positive views of the former regime (even in Poland, these are official statistics from pew polls, and should therfore be taken much more seriously then one person posting comments on youtube, who claims he is from Poland). Capitalist encirclement and propaganda led the people to ""democracy” (a code word for capitalism) and now that it is widespread in Eastern Europe the mistrust of “elites” (the capitalist class) is staggering. General feeling among most of the working class is that they were sold down the river.﻿ Then there is Cuba. When Castro's communists executed a few hundred of the previous regime's police assassins and torturers, drove assorted upperclass moneybags into exile, and intimidated various other opponents of radical reforms into silence, he made Cuba a different place. The Cuban revolution brought sanitation, schools, health clinics, jobs, housing, and human services to a level not found anywhere in the Third World and in many parts if the First World. Infant mortality dropped from 60 per 1000 in 1960 to 9.7 per 1000 in 1991, while life expectancy rose from 55 to 75 in that same period. Smallpox, malaria, tuberculosis, typhoid, polio, and numerous other diseases have been wiped out by improved living standards and public health programs. Cuba has enjoyed a level of literacy higher than the United States and a life expectancy that compares well with advanced industrial nations. Cuba has the most teachers, most art institutions and sports instructors per capita then any other countries. The Cuban government has sent teachers, doctors, and workers to dozens of Third World countries without charging a penny. They shed their own blood fighting colonialism, apartheid, and fascism. They treated 13,000 victims of the Chernobyl tragedy, more than all other nations combined. We never hear about these things when our western states blockade them, stifling their economic relations and therfore stifling their economy. They achieved these things despite the many capitalist efforts to undermine them. Image what they could achieve if they had access to most of the worlds resources and infrastructure and were allowed to trade fairly.

When stakeholders exercise their freedom of enterprise, to decide how their company will operate, they violate their employees' right to decide how their labor capacity will be used. Parecon is a formulation that grants all the right of self management, which is the only formulation of ""economic freedom"" that does not implicitly grant some people freedom at the expense of others. Private ownership subverts self management and equity, defined as payment according to effort, since this maxim implies that income derived from ownership of property is unjustifiable. Profit maximization under competitive conditions implies that any kind of laboring activity that generates employee empowering traits will have an actual market wage less than its socially optimal wage and be undersuppied by private employees, while any kind if labor activity that weakens employee empowering traits will be paid more than its socially optimal wage and be over suplied by private employers. So profit maximization under private enterprise undermines rather than promotes self management and solidarity, and misallocates human productive potentials as well. You still don't get that parecon is not central planing? It is community planning. Also, you have zero knowledge on if it works or not. Just saying, ""it does not work"", when it has never been tested, is an ignorant and lazy argument. Not even central planning has ever been tested as a dominant economic ideology. To say it has is to use many fallacies. Why do I answer your questions, yet you have not been able to defend a single contradiction in the "" free market"" economy I have mentioned?

From the King at the head to the poorest noble, they used their power badly. The rulers treated and ruled the vast mass of the nation, as people created for their convenience, to supply them with money and to serve them. The King demanded great sums to provide armies for his wars, to surround himself with a brilliant and luxurious Court, to defray the expenses of government. The money was raised by laying heavy taxes on the people, and on the people alone; the upper classes paid nothing. The peasant, the farmer, the townsman, from their scanty purses were drawn the large sums required. Here was a very great injustice which was plain to all men. But the royal taxes were not all; after the King, the nobles wanted their due. In the hundred years before the Revolution, the French nobility had deserted their country homes for the Court, and their days were spent at Paris, Versailles, or Fontainebleau. Their castles stood empty, their faces were no more seen among their tenants, but their calls for money were unceasing. They wished to shine at Court, and this demanded a heavy outlay, and the last farthing was wrung from the peasant's little hoard. The power of feudal days still existed in the hands of a French noble, though the conditions of feudal life had long since gone.The noble used these powers to lay very heavy conditions on his tenants. The small farmer had to pay rent for his land in three ways: in coin, in kind, and in labour. Very often the money-rent was an ample sum to cover the value of the holding, but he was far from being quits with his master. He had next to pay the rent in kind: so much corn, so much butter, so many cheeses, so many fowls, to be sent to the big house. Then came the rent in labour: he had to mend the roads of his master, help to till the fields, and to find horse and cart whenever there were loads to carry. He had to pay dues to his lord at times of marriage or of death; he was bound to grind his corn at his lord's mill, to press his grapes, his olives, and his walnuts at his lord's press, to bake his bread at his lord's oven—and for all these he must pay.

This will include maximum utilization of natural energy sources such as solar, wind, tidal, geothermal and hydroelectric power, as well as research into the potential fusion, and organic bio-fuels from human and animal waste (rather than food crops). These alternative methods of energy extraction would be by their own very nature far more decentralized and less susceptible to monopolization. This would also provide a new avenue of productive capital investment engendering grassroots participation and opportunities for local ownership, creating new jobs and sustainable economic enterprises.   A massive investment in renewable energy could make 'every building a power station', creating thousands of 'green collar jobs'.   'The institute of Science in Society (ISIS), an independent London scientific research group, have renewable energy blueprints highlighting the necessity for 'a diversity of sustainable renewable energies at medium-, small- micro-generation scales, according to resources locally available, so that energy is used at the point of generation'.  This would save up to 69% of the energy currently lost through long-distance transport of electricity from centralized power plants.  ISIS also emphasized the revolutionary significance of 'energy from-waste technologies' largely ignored by governments, for example 1)producing bio-gas from organic wastes (agricultural, municipal and industrial) which can be used to generate electricity and even to power cars (as opposed to producing bio-fuels from food crops): 2)using green algae for capturing carbon dioxide from the exhaust of power plants, coupled with bio-diesel production from waste for fuel.  New breakthroughs in solar energy mean that available technologies are growing more efficient and more affordable with time, 'and will be an important small- to micro-generation technology especially suited for Third World countries lacking energy infrastructure'.  Another little-known technology is the ""production of bio-diesel from waste plastics that cannot be easily recycled into plastics'.   Post-carbon civilization should aim to facilitate and synergize grassroots networks across the world attempting to self-organize on the basis of sustainability, justice and well-being, re-defined in terms of human solidarity with one another and harmonization with nature: as well as to develop the capacity of these groups to coordinate and share ideas, vision and resources through transnational lines of communication that bypass purely hierarchical political structures premised on domination by a few. This does not mean all forms of hierarchy should be automatically excluded, but that they must always be made fully accountable in their entire organizational structure to communities. Some structures already exist in skeleton form, such as the World Social Forum, which brings together grassroots communities from all over the world.  These structures could be extended regardless of the lack of political support from mainstream state-institutions, their existence and moral authority acting as a powerful beacon to the rest of the world.   The aim would be to 'level' world order away from the existing Western-dominated global governance architecture, by the world's peoples unilaterally erecting their own. Activists will mobilize ideas and small communities, with the monumental potential of alternative, decentralized, transnational political economic and monetary structures that synergize grassroots communities, and demonstrates that communities can collaborate in establishing these structures now;  What will give these institutions strength and life is simply the extent to which people actually -participate in and benefit from them.  By the mid twenty-first century, as global crises render existing national and international politico-economic structures increasingly irrelevant, such alternative structures will became more, rather than less, viable as part of an emerging post-carbon civilization. Smaller self sustainable communities can implement intelligent participatory economic solutions, planning much more community projects that serve people rather than profit. The answer is more government, localized, self sufficient, and with control of means of production, with representative democracy in place in the work place, and all environments that effect a persons life.

Marxism is a social science that takes into account class dimensions. Class centers around relationship with resources and labor; the only real means of creating material wealth.   For example there can be no lords without serfs, no masters without slaves, no capitalists without workers. Class is a relationship to the means of production but also to social and state power. This idea, so fundamental to an understanding of public policy, is avoided by conventional social scientists who prefer to concentrate on everything else but class power realities.  They try to teach us that there is no class struggle going on. Mainstream social science, when analyzing child labor in Indonesia, will not take into account how this child labor is contracted out by multinational corporations at near starvation wage levels. Or that these exploitive relations were backed by the full might of the Indonesian military government. Or that this government gets generous military aid from the United States, and that for decades the homicidal Indonesian military has been financed, armed, advised, and trained by the U.S. security state. Or that the conditions found in Indonesia (economic exploitation, brutal military repression, and lavish U.S. support) exist in scores of other countries. This whole phenomenon is consistent with the U.S. dedication to making the world safe for the free market and the giant multinational corporations, and that the intended goals are (a) to maximize opportunities to accumulate wealth by depressing the wage levels of workers throughout the world and preventing them from organizing on behalf of their own interests, and (b) to protect the overall global system of free-market capital accumulation.  This is why extremists, dictators and fascists get funded and used as tools to supress democracy. Democracy is a direct enemy to exploitation. In dominant capitalist states they offer token democracy and conditions they calculate will be tolerable, because they know that people who believe they are free can mobilize fast if the illusion is broken. Worker mobilization leads to democratic results. All important policy is determined by an elitest group. Thus we have a plutocracy with some democracy that can only be achieved through organized mobilization of the populace. We enjoy cheap goods because of exploitation of the South and East and they get poverty in return. We waste our comparatively cheap resources and create a huge 'vulture class' of finance investers who sell imaginary crap, while the people at the bottom pick up the tab.",UCh8-eoRLv-12jTIS6EQh2-w,1,Ughz0e1ANwMJEXgCoAEC,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

Recession may be ""healing"" or correction for the market itself but that's a rather intellectual way of looking at it, completely devoid of humanity. The working and poor classes don't heal during recessions. They suffer in a shrinking job market with less resources. Many are forced to going into debt to survive using credit. In 2007-2008, the ability to use credit and borrow nearly evaporated. I tend to avoid extremes. The idea that government intervention of any kind is fascist is extreme. There's a middle ground somewhere. It's also unrealistic to believe that any government will allow a market to do anything it wants without some involvement, restriction or regulation. If that be case, get rid of all government and let's just have pure anarchy. It's also unrealistic to believe that capitalism is a perfect, self-watering garden always bearing fruit for everyone (and that it bears more fruit under complete absence of regulation). Capitalism may be a better alternative to other systems, but it's not perfect and government isn't the only thing making it imperfect. Like any system, capitalism has cracks and people fall through it. But the idea that it's this pristine perfect circle is the true hoax.

In fact those recessions are periods of economy healing, people correcting their errors. But financial crises are effects of centralized creation of fiat money, which distorts market and then compounds the effect of recession by leading to further malinvestment by businesses. Actually Mises and Hayek did elaborate on that very subject proving FED was the source of repeated financial bubbles in US. _don't the basic ideas of capitalism without any form of regulation, checks, balances or anything to curtail the negative aspects...""_ What is the basic idea of capitalism? Ownership of property: I have a patch of land, I grow cabbage and potatoes, and you have pottery shop and make pots and vessels. And then we trade. Any interference in that process, a regulatory agent only makes it less effective and makes us both poorer. Quis custodiet ipsos custodes? Advocating government control - which in essence is monopoly on violence - to curtail capitalism is counterproductive. On a free market anyone wanting your money must offer you something you want, meet some of your need in order to get your money, it's a win-win. When it comes to government, they take their salary - expropriate you - by coersion. Puting government in charge of business is therefore not a very good idea. Historically church, morality was an element curtailing greed etc., and the ethics steming from religion were the source of law protecting people from the government (a monarch, bureaucracy) and each other. That is the only role for the government: enforce the law, but not create regulations. Regulations are what keeps crooks out of jail, immune from the law that applies to the rest of us - corporations write regulations. _""I'm just not clear on how the capitalist market that is in effect today helps the middle class or the poor...""_ It helps where we actually have market economy, but in many cases we don't and that is what destroys the middle class and makes everybody poorer, leaving only corporations in relationship with the government (which is called fascism) and proletariat. https://youtu.be/0-9tUqeZCAI",UCK6RrUewR6wL0eGlunAWLDw,1,Ughz0e1ANwMJEXgCoAEC,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

But socialist/welfare state manages to drain the economy to such extent that only due to increasing levels of debt and remarkable progress in industrial productivity it can maintain the appearance of liquidity and delay the inevitable bankruptcy. From the economic point of view welfare state resembles a snake eating its own tail. Taking on welfare rapidly increases state spending, so the state has to raise taxes. However this can not be done indefinitely due to Laffer effect: above a certain level of taxation government revenue not only does not increase, but decreases. The reason is simple: every enterprise has a level of fiscal burden x, that at x+1 it is no longer profitable and goes bankrupt. Those businesses not only don't pay more taxes, they pay no taxes. Moreover their former employees now become new clients of the welfare state and report for unemployment benefits. Furthermore some businessmen, guided by the instinct of self-preservation, come to the conclusion they must hide their activities from the state in order to maintain afloat and provide livelihood to their employees and families.  In conclusion: it is the state that manufactures poverty and unemployment. -- _""If Socialists understood economics, they wouldn't be socialists.""_ - Friedrich Von Hayek",UCK6RrUewR6wL0eGlunAWLDw,1,Ughz0e1ANwMJEXgCoAEC,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

That's capitalism.   This is not true.  History proves you wrong.  I have already told you some history that proves you wrong.  You may be confused because of propaganda.  Lets look at elections in two countries and how they were covered by the media. Just for starters. Nicaragua 1984 (not a US. client state), El Salador 1982,84(US client state). By any reasonable standard, the elections in Nicaragua were superior in circumstances, conditions, and procedure to those in El Salvador; the media overcame these facts by adopting the U.S. government agenda, which differed radically in the two cases. Freedom of speech, association, and organization, even massive state terror, were all off the agenda for the elections in client states, while attention was focused on long lines of patient voters (in elections where voting was obligatory, and the penalties for not participating could be severe), on alleged guerrilla threats (often fabricated), and so on. The very fact that elections were held at all under conditions of strife was considered a triumph of democracy. In the case of Nicaragua, the agenda was reversed: terrorist actions of the U.S.-run proxy forces to disrupt the elections were off the agenda, as were proper procedures, far less repression than in the client states, broad participation with no compulsion, and a wide range of choices constrained by no serious interference apart from U.S. pressures to induce its favored candidates to withdraw so as to discredit the election as ""lacking any real choice."" Any deviations from the performance of advanced industrial democracies under peacetime conditions were scrutinized and angrily deplored, and the only serious issue was the prospects for the U.S.-backed candidate for president, taken to be the measure of democracy. Apart from the U.S. government, the major news sources were the U.S.-backed opposition, who, along with the contra ""civilian directorate"" established and lavishly supported by the CIA, received extensive and favorable press; the fact that the U.S. candidates appeared to have little popular support, and little in the way of democratic credentials so far as was known, was also off the agenda. In the client states, there was no need to report on any domestic opposition, since they had not been able to survive the conditions of democracy, U.S.-style. Close analysis of coverage reveals these and related patterns quite dramatically. The 1984 elections in Nicaragua were dismissed with derision or ignored, while studies by highly qualified observers and analysts were, and remain, beyond the pale, because they consistently reached the wrong conclusions: for example, the detailed examination by a delegation of the professional association of Latin American scholars (LASA), probably the most careful study of any third World election, and the supporting conclusions by an Irish Parliamentary delegation drawn primarily from the center-right, among many others, all passing without mention. The media even permitted themselves to be duped by a transparent fraud, the well-timed ""discovery"" of a shipment of MiG fighter planes to Nicaragua, which predictably turned out to be fanciful and was later attributed to Oliver North's shenanigans, but which admirably served its purpose of helping to efface the unwanted Nicaraguan elections. When it had become obvious that no MiGs had arrived, a new phase of disinformation began, shifting attention to the leak of secret information (that is, to the planned release of intelligence fabrications, so it appears), condemned as ""criminal"" by Secretary Shultz. The press again went along, taking the issue to be the alleged leak and not the propaganda exercise in which they had participated, even claiming that the MiG pretense had harmed the U.S. and anti-Sandinista groups. In reality, the exercise had succeeded in every achievable aim, helping to bury the results of the election ""under an avalanche of alarmist news reports,"" as the LASA report observed. The media never returned to the matter to provide a meaningful report or analysis of the elections. Cooperation in the MiG fraud was, of course, only one ancillary device employed to eliminate the unwanted elections from official history, but it played its useful role. In contrast, elections at the same time in the terror state of El Salvador were effusively lauded as a bold and courageous advance towards democracy, on the basis of reporting of shameful bias and superficiality reflecting the U.S. government agenda and reliance on official observers who made barely a pretense of inquiry. There was virtually no concern over the fact that the political opposition had been murdered and the independent media physically destroyed by the U.S.-organized security forces while the population was thoroughly traumatized by extraordinary terror, and surely no mention of the conclusion by observers from the British Parliamentary Human Rights Group that the elections were held in an ""atmosphere of terror and despair, of macabre rumor and grisly reality,"" or the evidence that justifies this conclusion. The same was true in the case of the elections in Guatemala, where state terror had reached even more extreme heights with constant U.S. support. New York Times correspondent Stephen Kinzer even suggested that the Guatemalan election offered a model for Nicaragua. Subsequent commentary, virtually exceptionless in the mainstream, contrasts the ""fledgling democracies"" of the client states and their ""elected presidents"" with totalitarian Nicaragua, run by the dictator Ortega, placed in power in a sham election, hence unelected. The performance merits comparison with the official media of totalitarian states. Coverage of the 1982 Salvadoran elections was comparable. The three U.S. TV networks devoted over two hours to upbeat and enthusiastic coverage (the Nicaraguan elections of 1984, in contrast, merited fifteen minutes of skepticism or derision). The British networks had eighty minutes of coverage but the character was radically different. The U.S. networks reported with much fanfare the conclusions of the official U.S. government observers, who, after a cursory look, reported in a press conference their amazement at this thrilling exercise in democracy. In contrast, BBC's Martin Bell in his summary report commented that a fair election under the circumstances of state terror that BBC had reviewed was completely out of the question, while the commercial TV channel ITN featured Lord Chitnis of the British Parliamentary Human Rights Group, speaking not in a plush hotel but in a Salvadoran slum, where he pointed out that what observers see under army guard is hardly worth reporting under the prevailing conditions of hideous repression and trauma. More generally, the U.S. and European media gave radically different accounts of the Salvadoran elections. Analyzing the comparative coverage, Jennifer Schirmer concludes that the enthusiastic U.S. coverage was ""remarkably different"" from the reaction of the European press, which focused on the circumstances of terror that made an election meaningless, coerced voting, and other crucial factors suppressed in the euphoric U.S. commentary. She observes that ""the major difference is that while the European press consistently emphasized the political context of fear and the climate of official terror in which the elections took place, the U.S. press predominantly focused on electoral mechanics and theatre, echoing U.S. and Salvadoran officials in labelling those who were legally and physically excluded from the contest as marxist, anti-democratic and violent."" New York Times Paris Bureau Chief John Vinocur added to the deception by falsifying the European reaction to bring it into line with the upbeat U.S. response. Schirmer's conclusion is that the picture provided by the European media, apart from being accurate, was virtually barred in the United States, where ""the `reality' created and assumed by the U.S. press is so one-sided and partisan that the U.S. government shall not need to censor its press in future coverage of the Third World.",UCh8-eoRLv-12jTIS6EQh2-w,1,Ughz0e1ANwMJEXgCoAEC,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

In fact so simple that even a total idiot like you should understand. Let's say you've got income and Mr. Chomsky does not. (They finally kick him out from whatever taxpayer subsidized institution he's in.) Being the socially-sensitive human being you are you want to help him out. You could of course share your money with him outright. But then he could also offer you his services: teach you a language, mow your lawn, babysit your kids, drive you from A to B, paint your house, or whatever. You hire him, he does the job and he gets the money, you are both happy. But then there's a third option: a government clerk may take your money, take a cut on account of his salary, gives the rest to another clerk, who also takes a cut and gives whatever remains to Chomsky as unemployment benefit. Now, can you recognize the effects of the third option? For one thing you neither have the money, nor you have any work done - you simply got poorer, and worst yet you still have to perform all the chores yourself or take up an extra job to hire help. Whereas Chomsky, while being idle and unproductive, and not contributing to the society, is worst off than if he dealt with you directly. The only winning party here is the government - the two clerks: one to collect tax and the other to give out the subsidy. But the most important part is that no new wealth has been created in the process. Chomsky did not contribute any new wealth to the society to be spread around. Neither the clerks produced anything. The first option above is called charity. The second - free market capitalism, and the third - the welfare state. Now tell me, which option you would choose, be honest. The problem with the third option is that by design it leads to economic ruin. The redistributive act of the government only consumes the wealth already in existence, it does not produce any new wealth.

In 1983 US forces invaded the tiny and relatively defenseless sovereign nation of Grenada (population 110,000) in blatant violation of international law.  The Reagan (hmm..Reagan was a big fan of leaving the free market along) administration justified the assault by claiming a variety of charges that proved to be without foundation (familiar story).  Under the Grenadian revolutionary government, free milk and other foodstuffs were being distributed to the needy as were materials for home improvement.  Grade school and secondary education were free for everyone for the first time.  Free health clinics were opened in the countryside, thanks mainly to Cuban doctors.  Measures were taken in support of equal pay and legal status for woman.  Unused land was leased to establish farm cooperatives and turned agriculture away from cash-crop exports and more toward self-sufficient food production.  The US invasion and occupation put an end to almost all these programs.  Under US hegemony, unemployment in Grenada reached new heights and poverty new depths.  Domestic cooperatives were suppressed or starved out.  Farm families were displaced to make way for golf courses, and the corporate controlled tourist industry boomed.  Grenada was once more firmly bound to the privatized free-market world, once again safely Third Worldized. The US national security state has participated in covert actions or proxy mercenary wars against reformist or revolutionary governments in Cuba (why do you think things are fucked up in Cuba?), Angola, Mozambique, Ethiopia, Portugal, Nicaragua, Cambodia, Lebanon, Peru, Iran, Syria, Jamaica, South Yemen, the Fiji Islands, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. In many cases the attacks were terroristic in kind, directed at ""soft targets"" such as schools, farms cooperatives, health clinics, and whole villages.  Since World War 2 US forces have invaded or launched aerial assaults against Vietnam, Laos, the Dominican Republic, North Korea, Cambodia, Lebanon, Granada, Panama, Libya, Iraq, Somalia, Yugoslavia, and Afghanistan-a record of direct military aggression unmatched by any ""communist"" government in history.﻿",UCh8-eoRLv-12jTIS6EQh2-w,1,Ughz0e1ANwMJEXgCoAEC,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

For generations, the great majority of Afghanistan's people were involved in farming. The landholding system had remained unchanged since feudal times, with more than 75% of the land owned by big landlords who comprised only 3% of the rural population. In the mid 1960's democratic revolutionary elements coalesced to form the People's Democratic Party (PDF). In 1973, the king was deposed, but the government that replaced him proved to be autocratic, corrupt, and unpopular. It was forced out in 1978 after a massive demonstration in front of presidential palace, and after the army intervened on the side of the demonstrators. The military officers who took charge then invited the PDP to form a new government under the leadership of Noor Muhammed Taraki, a poet and novelist. This is how a Marxist led coalition of national democratic force came into office. ""It was a truly indigenous happening. Not even the CIA blamed the USSR for it"" wrote John Ryan, a retired professor at the University of Winnipeg, who was conducting an agricultural research project in Afghanistan at about the time. The new government began to pursue much needed reforms. It legalized labor unions, and set up a minimum wage, a progressive income tax, a literacy campaign, and programs that gave ordinary people greater access to health care, housing, and public sanitation. The Taraki government also continued a campaign begun by the king to emancipate woman from their age old tribal bondage. It provided public education for girls and for children of various tribes. And it moved to eradicate the cultivation of opium poppy. Until then Afghanistan had been producing more than 70% of the world's opium used to make heroin. The government also abolished all debts owed by farmers, and began developing a major land reform program. The federal landowners opposed the land reforms program that infringed on their holdings while benefiting poor farmers. And tribesmen and fundamentalist mullahs vehemently opposed the government's dedication to gender equality and the education of woman and children. Because of its egalitarian economic policies the government also incurred the opposition of the US security state. The Marxists were advocating the kind of distribution of social resources that incurs the hatred and fear of the US ruling class and privileged classes everywhere. Almost immediately after the PDP coalition came to power, the CIA, assisted by Saudi and Pakistani military, launched a large scale intervention into Afghanistan on the side of the ousted feudal lords, reactionary tribal chieftains, mullahs, and opium traffickers. A top official within the Taraki government was Hafizulla Amin, believed by many to have been recruited by the CIA during the several years he spent in the United States as a student.  In September 1979, Amid seized state power in an armed coup.  He executed Taraki, halted reforms, and murdered, jailed or exiled thousands of Takaki supporters as he moved toward establishing a fundamentalist Islamic state.  But within two months, he was overthrown by PDP remnants including elements within the military.  It should be noted that all of this happened before the Soviet military intervention.  Zbigniew Brzezinski, national security adviser under President Carter, publicly admitted, months before Soviet troops entered the country that the Carter administration was providing huge sums to Muslim extremists to subvert the reformist government.  In late 1979, the restored but seriously besieged PDP government asked Moscow to send a contingent of troops to help ward off the mujahideen (Islamic guerrilla fighters) and foreign mercenaries, all recruited, financed, and well armed by the CIA.  The Soviets already had been sending assistance for projects in mining, education, agriculture,and public health.  Sending troops represented a commitment of a more serious and politically dangerous sort.  If took repeated request from Kabul before Moscow agreed to intervene militarily.  Referring to her two visits to Afghanistan in 1980-81 during the first years of Soviet intervention, Marilyn Bechtel, former editor of New World Review, reported seeing woman working together in handicraft co-ops; for the first time they were paid decently for their work and could control the money they earned.  She observed women and men learning to read, and woman working as professionals, holding responsible government positions.  For the first time, poor working families were able to afford a doctor and to send their children to school.  Bechtel also mentions the cancellation of peasant debt and the start of land reform, fledgling peasant cooperatives, price controls and price reductions on some key foods, and aid to nomads interested in a settled life.  She was less happy to observe the brutal results of attacks upon schools and teachers in rural areas by the CIA backed mujahideen.  A report in the San Francisco Chronicle notes that ""Kabul was once a cosmopolitan city.  Artists and hippies flocked to the capital.  Women studied agriculture, engineering and business at the city's university.  Afghan women held government jobs in the 1980,s, there were seven female members of parliament.  Women drove cars, traveled and went on dates.  Fifty percent of university students were women.  In keeping with the ideological self-censorship that characterizes the US press, at no time does this story point out that women were doing all these things during the reign of a Soviet-supported Marxist government.﻿",UCh8-eoRLv-12jTIS6EQh2-w,1,Ughz0e1ANwMJEXgCoAEC,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

To understand the big picture you need to understand how much of the current structure of global agribusiness was established through the 'Green Revolution, of the 1960's and 1970's, during which the US invested heavily in agricultural development in India and other countries of the South, including the introduction of new seeds, modern industrial agricultural techniques, fertilizers and pesticides, heavy water usage, and so on.  This process involved the integration of crop and livestock production into large-scale, transnational agri-food complexes promoting commercial agricultural exports - i.e. cash crops. Thus subsistence farming based on the production of staple foods such as corn, beans, and so on for local consumption was largely absorbed by transnational agribusiness, often transformed and integrated into a form of contract farming.  Consequently, basic food staples produced in the South are transported across vast distances to supply Western supermarket chains, while hundreds of millions of Southern residents are compelled to purchase expensive imports from US agribusiness to meet their own needs.  World Bank and International Monetary Fund structural adjustment programs have increasingly subordinated and marginalized traditional farming by and for local communities, again privileging large-scale industrial farming in the service of transnational agribusiness.  These structural reforms forced Southern governments to open markets, land and other resources to predatory exploits of private agribusiness, and compelled governments to cut subsidies to small farmers in rural areas and cut tariffs on food imports, while instead supporting high-value export agriculture.  Simultaneously, massive government subsidies to large landowners and agribusiness corporations have permitted US exporters to sell specific agricultural products such as rice and grain at 30 to 50% below their real production cost, resulting in a massive influx of US exports into Southern countries, undercutting the livelihoods of subsistence farmers and forcing them to switch to mono-culture production for export under contract with transnational agribusiness.  Government subsidies accout for some 30% of farm revenue in OECD countries.  Smaller peasant farmers have thus become extraordinarily susceptible to price fluctuations in the world market.  It is no coincidence then that in the very countries where export agriculture is promoted millions of people are hungry.  For example, in 2004 India exported $1.5 billion worth of milled rice and $322 million worth of wheat, yet over one fifth of the Indian population is chronically hungry and 48% of children under five years old are malnourished.  The misconception that larger enterprises are more efficient or productive is a myth. Large enterprises are all about mass exploitation.  Also, modern farming methods are unsustainable and erode topsoil.  Unlike traditional rotating crop methods to maintain soil quality.   Of coarse nothing to do with capitalism.  Nothing bad is ever the fault of capitalism.  ",UCh8-eoRLv-12jTIS6EQh2-w,1,Ughz0e1ANwMJEXgCoAEC,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

A capitalist is an individual who owns such a sizable portion of productive or distributive property that he/she doesn't have to work in order to receive wealth. A capitalist produces no wealth at all but simply owns. Now, what is a worker? A worker is an individual who does not own enough productive property to live off of, and therefore must work for a capitalist (or group of them), or for the government that they control, in order to survive. A worker does not receive the full value of the work that he/she creates, which makes him/her dependant upon the capitalist. Therefore, the amount of an individual's income doesn't make them a capitalist or a worker; rather, their relationship to the means of production does. For example, doctors and computer technicians are considered to be well paid, but they are still workers...they must perform a service in order to make a living. Yet, the income they receive is still far less then that of most capitalists, who need perform no service to live, but simply survive by ""owning.""﻿",UCh8-eoRLv-12jTIS6EQh2-w,1,Ughz0e1ANwMJEXgCoAEC,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

Imagine how easy it would be for the ""elite cabal"" to make these few climate change deniers you follow, disappear, if that was their agenda.  Would not need to kill them or anything, just use your influence and power to make sure they got no media time.  Hard to do this with the overwhelming majority but easy with a few dissenters.  Please tell me what you think their goal is?  What exactly do you think they want to achieve and how?  Just profiteering?  Which they could do anyway.  The profiteering is win, win at the mo, because it sows doubt, and increases profits.

Challenging the current economic model is a challenge to neo-liberial capitalists.  Green alternatives serve to decentralize the power structures, and allow for greater independence of states, allowing for freer and more independent trade deals.  Of coarse the capitalist system is wide open for psychopaths to exploit, and they will exploit climate change, just like everything else.  Like most things all one needs to do is follow the money to the truth.   Funny thing is you really believe you are thinking for yourself, yet it is only a handful of people with any qualifications, that you listen to.

Nobody disputed that classical Marxmist models are deeply floored and do not place enough emphasis on political corruption and direct corruption of officials but when you look at Karl Marx's literature on capitalism and imperialism, he made some remarkable predictions.  He predicted 1)  The expansion of capitalism on a world scale. 2)  The competitive, expansionist and warlike nature of developed capitalist states. 3)  The reproduction of socio-economic inequalities on a world scale deriving from the unequal nature of capitalist expansion. 4)  The entrenchment of structures of unequal power and wealth in social, economic, political, legal and cultural sectors. 5)  Capitalist expansion's generation of resistance and anti-imperialism.

Also exhaust fumes are highly toxic mixtures containg sulphur which is quite harmful. Schools teach general knowledge and if you try diving into the specifics you notice things are quite wrong. Add to that global warming causing massive drought spells leading to forest fires and causing the Antarctic to melt. There is a recent Vice documentary about the same thing. In that documentary there is a certain iceberg the size of Germany and if it breaks loose from the continent and melts in the warm seas there will be a rise of almost 1-2 feet atleast(they say 3-10 feet). About electric cars. The reason why its expensive is becuase people dont buy them and they are a niche market.  The moment everyone starts demanding this thing, its price will fall. I too go to a technical school and I have made one such ""golf course"" car, it was a good thing but I realise that the ""electric"" car takes its energy from oil/petrol as well. What is needed is a significant push towards developing renewable sources of energy. Continued dependence on oil is not the answer and you too know it. Right now by denying any focus towards this sector there is considerable damage being done. Yes gasoline is convienient... but what about the future?   While I understand you are a sceptic please notice that scientists gain nothing by talking about global warming. The renewable energy market isnt growing as fast as the oil market and oil has major companies backing it up with astronomical profits. You by siding with these companies which are run by ppl who want to maximise profits are simply being foolish.  Major financial istitutions like Golman Sachs too are looking at corporations carbon footprint for their growth projections/profits/future reveneue etc. Dont apply the Copernicus analogy here, you are doing that guy a disservice. He fought ignorance and dogma to tell everyone the truth. The few scientists against this grand consensus are funded by oil companies(quid pro quo?) and even they say that while the climate is changing, its not as scary as everyone things its is. See Vice's documentary Vice on HBO season 3 episode 1""Our rising oceans"". More information on the same can be found very easily on the internet.  ",UCFlKouxMmChEKU_ZlnNiR-A,1,UgiYpZPzqGVGyHgCoAEC,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

To believe that the whole body of science manipulates data to make their point is to believe in one of the biggest conspiracies ever, not to mention it directly defeats the purpose of science. Science is a protocol to statistically verify truths. Once you leave statistical analysis and truths out of the process, there is absolutely no way you can call that science.

Oddly enough I already had a decent amount of knowledge about this topic which started with my reading a book about the pineapple express. I had never thought of such phenomena as 'waves' due to my background being more established in physics and mathematics. To me a wave is an element of strict characteristics, whereas planetary waves are essentially chaotic structures that follow general patterns at an aggregate level. This also leads me to wonder, perhaps you can explain, how planetary waves have causal importance to climate change. I have no doubt that they are of immense importance to the resultant changes and have further implications in feedback or multiplier effects to the future of the climate. Where I see the distinction is that these planetary waves are secondary in terms of the 'is climate change real' argument whereas understanding how the waves of energy emitted by the sun behave and act at a molecular level is the sine qui non of the whole debate. The energy emitted as waves that hits the earth is either reflected or absorbed, by changing the molecular structure of the atmosphere there is a change to the amount of energy absorbed (or not reflected). There is no room for debate about these facts and thus I find it to be the best way to demonstrate that humans are changing the climate; to argue otherwise would be the equivalent of arguing 1 + 1 does not equal 2. Thus a person is forced into demonstrating their ultimate disposition as either logical or absurd. While we cannot force everyone to accept reality, we should actively marginalize those who chose to do so because they are destructive entities to us as a species and the planet as a whole.",UC7PYrfaq9Ysoz7yzjF9eSUQ,1,UgjMfVRvj5bvA3gCoAEC,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

Use day-to-day comparisons and loops to watch the movement of the short waves and the changes in the long wave pattern. Compare what you see with the features and patterns described above.

Certainly this would cause measurements of temperature on the ground to be uncharacteristically low - so maybe it is fair to say that from the perspective of a person on the ground this is a 'cooling mechanism'. As for oscillations in the oceans, again you will have to be more specific. Are you referring to the seasonal changes in the level of the oceans due to the freeze/thaw cycles at the poles, or perhaps the changes in surface temperature due to seasonality, or perhaps the amount of dissolved gasses present that are a linear function of the specific temperatures?

The impact of the competing narratives and disinformation had been to create a perception of 'debate' or some kind of general confusion among the public. I do claim that we have a reasonable understanding of climate science this is where I think you are incorrect. We have, especially in the last century, developed the tools to measure with great accuracy the numerous physical elements that constitute modern climate science. This has allowed the collection of detailed empirical observations over a time period long enough to become useful when trying to develop models that can predict the future with ever increasing accuracy. The nature of ""the climate"" is such that any model that is constructed to approximate it will be extremely complex. There are many non-linear factors and feedback mechanisms, such as the ability water (the oceans) to hold dissolved gasses (from the air) which decreases as the temperature of the water increases. Also there are 'tipping-point' effects that have serious implications on the future climate, such as the massive amount of methane that is currently held in the soil of the arctic. This methane has been effectively locked in the ground in what is called the permafrost (never warms above freezing) for thousands of years. The release of methane deposits changes the chemistry of the atmosphere which changes the amount of heat (sunlight) that is absorbed rather than being radiated back out to space. These are all very well understood concepts with solid scientific backing however, these are just two examples of many that you can see will make any mathematical model ... complicated to say the least. Our knowledge of the climate is constantly increasing and since the advent of satellite technology we have the ability to truly observe the earth on a macro scale while gathering micro level details. Look at the massive global project by NASA et al called the 'A train'. Look at the capacity to take measurements and gather data that this project has yielded.

As the temperature rises the water which has been stored as ice at the poles has started the process of melting. *science warning* One of the interesting properties of water is that it actually expands when it solidifies (into ice) thus it is less dense than the water around it - ie. it floats. When you melt that ice, the part above the surface is now part of the ocean and thus takes up more space. This causes the oceans to rise (and this is already happening so denial isn't going to help you here) and if you look at the geographical distribution of the population of the earth you will soon see that * A LOT * of people are going to have to move or cope with living under water.

Nobody is talking about moving to Cuba. However, communism, capitalism along with any other system you can think of is designed for the people at the top to gain the most on the backs of the people below them. In a capitalist system, everyone idealizes getting to the top, which I gather is the ""American Dream."" We all love the American dream, but it has caused nightmares for others abroad and some domestically due to it's ""money first"" ideology, which we both love and hate. We want money, but we don't like exploitative greed. Greed may go hand-in-hand with loving money, but that's not intended as a black-and-white sales pitch between 2 systems. It's cynical, maybe nihilistic truth that you're getting raped no matter what you do. Just pick the guy with the shortest pole. That's capitalism. I'd take him over communism any day. I mean, what's the big difference between a violent rapist and a date rapist. The date rapist will buy you a drink, spike it and rape you while you're passed out so you don't remember it the next morning. I'd rather my date rapist be Obama or Bush than being violently raped by a Castro or Mao. I may not like any of them or the options they present ideally, but in life you pick the choices you have.

Looking at U.S. history on democracy and capitalism, I can't help but be extremely skeptical considering how the U.S. supported so many oppressive anti-democratic regimes that contradict on our own ""values"" including the Pinochet regime that violently ousted the democratically-elected Marxist President (after his fourth attempt at election) in Chile resulting in further torture, imprisonment, murder, and economic rape, which continued covertly in Latin America in the 1980s during the neoliberal Reagan era, once again in the name of Cold War era anti-Communism.

First on consensus, I agree that a consensus has no basis as a logical predicate for determining the validity of any specific claim.  However, it does have value in assessing the likelihood of a claim because it is not a random phenomenon.  Think, for example, of going to a second doctor, or mechanic, to get a 'second opinion', which is common enough and seen as prudent.  If your second opinion is the same as the first are you more or less likely to believe it.  Now extend that into the hundreds or the thousands.   Second on feedback loops, I will admit that in general, nature seems to work against outliers to maintain a balance rather than amplify.  However, what is currently taking place is most unnatural, as nature has never had to deal with humans on this scale.  The issue of serious concern for you should be, what if you are wrong and instead of a negative feedback there is a positive feedback?   I would still appreciate if you would provide me with some links to where you are getting your information so I can better understand why my science is junk science.  ",UC7PYrfaq9Ysoz7yzjF9eSUQ,1,UgjMfVRvj5bvA3gCoAEC,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

You see, I think you actually know better than this.  To make such implications is to engage in a deliberate misdirection to obscure the larger truth.   CO2 is a greenhouse gas, at least you agree with that much.  What is important that you are either missing or avoiding, is that the climate responds to certain changes in a manor that is actually greater than the direct effect of the change alone.  In simple terms this is known as a feedback mechanism.  For example if a small increase in temperature causes ice sheets (reflecting radiation) to melt exposing dark ground (absorbing radiation) you end up with more warming than just CO2 caused but it is quite obvious that a cause and effect relationship exists.   I don't know where you are getting your hard numbers from, 3 standard deviations is quite far to be reached in 5 years, could you provide me with a link I would like to see the model.",UC7PYrfaq9Ysoz7yzjF9eSUQ,1,UgjMfVRvj5bvA3gCoAEC,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

There is no point in talking any further about the science of climate change if you still believe the world is only 6000 years old. Anyway: 1. _There is no melting of if ice at either pole._ This is a blatant lie. It is even worse than simply melting of ice and refreezing: the ice that freezes over in winter is less thick. The ice doesn't even grow back to the size it had a year ago. Each year there is less ice and less thick ice. This is observed. 2. _The sea has been rising and lowing for thousands of years._ Yes, but then there were no 7 billion people alive, with the majority living in coastal areas. Sea level rise is one of the major problems of climate change. 3. _The is a village under the water in the English Channel, but at the time it was dry land._ Yes, your point being? 4. _What are the ""effects"" of global warming?_ Just to name a few: melting of poles, melting of glaciers, acidification of the oceans, sea level rise (and all the mess that follows it: salinization of freshwater, people migrating away from coasts, loss of land,...), harsher weather conditions, plants and animals dying because of heat, droughts, plants and animals  migrating to the north, loss of crops, more hunger for the poor,...  5. _And how do we ""take measures?"" Shut down coal fired power plants?_ That would be a good start. Stopping the burning of fossil fuels will have a big effect in minimising the effects. But what are you going to do with no energy? We have to learn to do with less + reconsider nuclear option (imo) + investing in other energy sources. We should aim at zero emissions, this is almost impossible. We should also get some of the CO2 back out of the atmosphere, but we don't have that technology yet. Right now, and it pains me to say this the only real option we have in putting global warming to a stop is nuclear power. It's at least the lesser evil. But if we aren't responsible with it, we're fucked on that too. I also don't see nuclear energy being used by poor countries, it's viewed as too much of a risk.

So basically the Califfornia drought and Texas drought are being done by the govt? Nasa isnt credible becoz it made mistakes? And its cold because you feel colder?  This entire ""debate"" in this comment thread is stupid to say the least. You clearly blame the govt for everything including drought. But then You also bring up the topic of 300 mpg saltwater car. You say its not allowed. Well thats because the oil/gas industry clearly do not like the idea of a salt-water powered car. Get this: Global warming is real and is responsible for causing freak weather patterns like polar vortexs and decade long droughts. Global warming is caused by man and his fascination for burning fossil fuels. IS the US govt doing enough to counter this and lead the world towards cleaner energy utilization? Answer: No. Big Oil clearly holds much sway in politics to allow this. So what should we do? Do our very best in our individual capacity to reduce our carbon footprint. Purchace wind and solar energy if its available, buy and electric car. If everyone does this, the price of electric car, solar and wind energy will become very cheap and more clean and efficient,  Actions speak louder than words. Our actions determine our future..  Stop blaming others and wasting time developing conspiracy theories. ",UCFlKouxMmChEKU_ZlnNiR-A,1,Ugi9VWG4_rBSlHgCoAEC,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

Of course there is consensus in science. There are no absolutes in science, but that's a big distinction. ""and this is certainly true regarding climate change research."" Again, where did you get that idea? There may be some debate as to which extent we're responsible, but there is consensus on the notion that indeed we are the most prominent of factors. In fact, research shows that if we wouldn't safeguard certain species from going extinct, we could in fact consider the situation we're in to be a mass extinction. It's not coincidental that this started to become prevalent in the 20th century. Also, even within politics there's a shift going on, and Google is going to give higher priority to credible, scientific sources regarding search results on climate change. This is basically information censorship, which I'm not happy about, though in this case I suppose I'm not too concerned considering the censorship is not based on opinions but on credibility. Regardless what you may think of such censorship, my point is that more and more politicians are starting to acknowledge climate change. In non-scientific circles there's still debate as to what's the cause of climate change, but the notion that climate change isn't real is no longer a popular idea, and the notion that climate change on Earth to the extent we observe is a natural phenomenon is also decreasing in popularity. That's not necessarily an indication that climate change is caused by us, but it does indicate another shift in our collective understanding is about to occur. Also, temperatures are only one of the indicators of climate change. ""There is no conclusive data that proves or disproves humans have significant impact on global climate."" You would have to define 'conclusive', but yes there is. I can send you a short video explaining how humans have significant impact. And to be clear, with significant impact I don't even mean to imply we are the most dominant factor, but we are the last factor to disturb the equilibrium. ""There is no doubt that the climate is changing and that humans have significant impact on the environment.  That is about it."" Is there anything more to it? You seem to be contradicting yourself. First you say there is no conclusive evidence and now you say there is no doubt. Which is it? ""Climatologists can't even predict the weather accurately let alone the climate."" The two are not correlated like you might think, which I think Dan already alluded to but you laughed at him for it. Weather forecasts are done based on current weather systems, which constantly change so the capacity and accuracy to predict weather is limited; the longer the forecast the less accurate it will be. Climate research is being done by studying trends over longer time periods. And do note that climate research is more than studying weather; it's also the study of the consequences of weather. The capacity to predict is vastly different in climate science. You could plot changes in climate over thousands of years. Possibly even millions of years if you exclude human influence and rare events like asteroid strikes. This fact alone is a big indication of our influence; we used to be able to plot changes in climate over longer periods, but we disrupted the balance to such extent that our predictive power regarding changes in climate are limited. You can make extended plots as long as there is a certain equilibrium. This is the danger fpr us, that we will ultimately disrupt the balance to such extent that there is no coming back from it. ""The 97% consensus propoganda is politics but I suspect you already know this.﻿"" Based on what do you believe this? There is no consensus propaganda. The media may add their own spin on science and misinterpreted it, but that's exactly why you ought to fact-check whatever you read. The media is a propaganda machine, but that's no reason to conclude that therefore the scientific enterprise is as well. You simply make way too many assertions.",UCcJx96qmOypSZoREeQoQtKA,1,UgjpV68R55p8m3gCoAEC,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

Me: ""For what is a person who has the results of their production removed for the use and disposal of another? "" ""I assume you mean taxes?"" I mean the unearned transfer of value under coercion to any other person or entity.  For example, when a person has their property stolen by a city so they can transfer it to a corporation or union headquarters because it enhances the tax base.  This is theft, robbery.  It's a situation (like many others) where if you refuse to transfer your asset to the state, if you refuse to abandon your property, they shoot you.  Just like under the Checkist in Russia.  You die.   It's an ""or else"" relationship.  Why can't we live by voluntary cooperation?  ""Just substitute the word taxes with ""service"" to get it. Were the state a private company, you wouldn't complain at all for all the services it provides."" Actually, you're getting near the target.  I don't really care what the entity calls it's self.  It could be ""State of Nevada"" or ""UFCW"" or ""Iron Workers Local 107"" or ""Billy Bob's Paint and Hardware"".   I don't care as long as I get to choose whom or if I buy goods and services. In my life, I do not force anybody to buy anything from me.   I provide goods, services and sometimes labor or a voluntary basis.  I have to please my customer.  I cannot hold a gun to his head.  How is it that we have persons who claim (and many accept) a right to use a gun to get their daily bread?  Why is that OK with you?    How do I earn a right to take things from others by force?  I realize it's simpleton thinking to imagine living by a principle of non-violence.   The gold-fever world where we are drugged with delusions of riches stolen from the backs of others is quite compelling.   But in the end, it's a kind of welfare.  Much of what is stolen for the transfer is raked off the top by snakes.  Hell, I've heard it reported only something like 30% of all revenue collected for welfare ever gets to the needy.  The rest of it is raked off the top for salaries, retirements and benefits of people who produce ""nothing"".  They are in fact on fat cat welfare themselves.  And, it's not charity.  It's taken by force, not cheerfully given.

They do it to influence legislation which could detriment their bsuiness, don't they? So why are you excluding them in your critism. I don't see the logical reasoning for this at all. This is ideological bias. You know why some scientific reports are shit? They've earnestly analysed an issue but ideological/paradigmatic bias clouded their judgements. You can't criticize one side and leave out the other without looking stupid. The fellacy lies in the blind trust of private companies, who fight for tax easing and federal support, therefore money  as well, as do any influence groups. We only have to look at actual US policy to see who has the biggest influence on such issues. Were the scientific preacher of the global warming such influential groups the Kyoto protocol would surely have been signed by US authorities, right? ""I appreciate this confession.  Yes, they are a lobby.  It is political.

Lobbyism by definition is a mean to gain political goals. It is not controversial at all if all stakeholders are invited, are eqqually heard to and the outcome  isn't predetermed. Unfortunately this is seldom the case. But unfortunately, like stated before, the US system is fully dependant on private party financing, unlike many other countries. ""I refuse to allow people to vote on what is true.  A theory is true or it is not."" It is a theory, because it is questioned by a vocal minority who manipulates the discourse in media by questionable methods. And I ment 15 thousand vs I dont know. It's like 93% in favor of human caused global warming. There are people questioning evolution as well. There might be some scientific papers arguing it doesn't exist. I mean when do you acknowledge something to be true? When there is no debate and no alternative view? In such a world ""truth"" wouldn't exist. The problem about lots of data and indicators often lies in the difference between correlation and causal effects. It is difficult to differentiate between both. Was does shorten our life-expendancy?

""Are these Chinese socialists not the biggest polluters on the planet?  These are the Communists you hold up as an example to me?"" China is a developing country. They have a income and development gap between major cities and rural areas. But fact is they are investing huge amount of money in future green tech. They are comparable to Japan of 1970 IMO which had big pollution problems as well. China is stricter regulation on car  emissions. They might be even stricter than the EU ones which don't differentiate between big and small cars in their lineup and only take the average emissions. Sure They have a long way to go, but Japan was laughted at in the 80ths because they copied western cars which are inferior. Chinas main goal is energy independance and subsistance. I think it will look way different in 30 years. The US and EU might lose technological leadership in many sectors if they don't get it. You also have to look at the per capital emissions. Of course absolute numbers are higher in China, but they have like 1.3 billion people.

These aren't simply predictions, it is happening NOW. Faced with all that, what's the practical response? To DO something to avoid as much of it as possible, and mitigate what we can't avoid. Avoidance is FAR cheaper and compatible with maintaining civilization as we have it today than mitigation which, in many cases, may not even be possible.

Depends; if you are a field researcher, freezing your ass off on the Greenland ice sheet like Dr. Jason Box for weeks at a time is not my idea of ""cushy"". Research is hard work, sometimes requiring strenuous physical labor in very harsh environments. Some may get to spend most of their time in the lab, or sitting behind a computer screen all day, but if you think that what they do is ""easy"", in line with what most people would consider a ""cushy"" job, you're sadly mistaken.

Second, nothing is stopping you from doing precisely what you are saying. Get off your fat ass, get into class, learn the science, prove your cred, and you'll find a job ""in front of beakers"", if that's your gig, anyway. However, if you're expecting some massive largesse from your ""fair share of this climate change pie"", you'll likely be sadly disappointed.

The margin of error is what makes it only 38% likely that 2014 was the warmest year on record (according to NASA's data) it's not the margin of error itself. The alleged ‘record’ amounted to an increase over 2010, the previous ‘warmest year’, of just two-hundredths of a degree – or 0.02C. The margin of error is said by to be approximately 0.1C – several times as much. “""Junk science"" is someone playing at science who does not follow the methods or rigors of real science to arrive at pre-conceived conclusions, and is trivially easy for someone who IS a scientist PRACTICING science to debunk.” - Again, since you seemed to miss it (big surprise) - in real science when scientists make a discovery & show their results to the world, they also show the work that produced those results to see if it stands up to scrutiny.

No, if anyone makes a claim that someone said something, especially in a contrary fashion, I expect to see evidence and facts to back up those claims. That means links to ACTUAL SOURCES. The Daily Mail wasn't a source; they didn't claim that they interviewed Gavin themselves, they said that he ""has now admitted"". Where? What did he actually /say/? * crickets * >Of course the headline ""The Data is in, NOAA & NASA Find There's a 38% Chance that 2014 Might Have Been the Hottest Year on Record"" wouldn't help them sell the junk science of AGW to low information voters, would it? It also wouldn't be true. The data is the data. It shows that 2014 is the hottest year on record, even if only by a very small amount. The only way that ranking can change is if the data or the methods use to analyze it, change significantly enough to change the arrived-at global average value. They may; the data and analysis methods are always improving. The 38% figure doesn't mean that they ""rolled the percentile dice and it came up in the range 0-38"". It means that, statistically, there is some amount of uncertainty which theoretically *could* alter the rankings. That 38% figure itself has a ""margin of error"", too. It also can mean that previous years *could* turn out to be even hotter after revisions, not that 2014 was any less hot. It's not a simple probability percentage, and treating it like one in a headline is deceptive and misleading. Thus, they didn't put it in the headline, but they *DID* put it in the briefing, IN CONTEXT. >Because climate science has long ago become nothing but junk science, hasn't it? No. ""Junk science"" is someone playing at science who does not follow the methods or rigors of real science to arrive at pre-conceived conclusions, and is trivially easy for someone who IS a scientist PRACTICING science to debunk.

If you're going to upset the applecart of climate science, you're going to have to really really do your homework, because you're up against some of the brightest people on the planet in this field of expertise. They know their shit, and demonstrate it regularly.

The incidents you are referring to have been examined and explained repeatedly. Some of the requests asked for data which was PURCHASED from meteorological organizations to be given out freely, against the LEGAL contractual obligations. It wasn't ""secret"" data; you just had to PAY for it, if you wanted it. Other requests asked for personal information and emails outside the purview of the organization requested to be obligated to provide. A scientist's own PERSONAL email account isn't subject to FOIA requests. As I have said before, NAME ONE data set or methodology that you think hasn't been published, and I'll provide links to it, or give a fair reason why I can't. If you can't NAME a SINGLE one, then I am going to mark this repeated claim you keep making as ""bullshit"" and ignore it from now on, k? >what they did find showed that Mann’s methodology was deeply flawed. Except, not. If you are referring to McIntyre's work, the corrections he was responsible for did not significantly alter the shape of the ""hockey stick"", and his own efforts for the rest were shown to be deeply flawed themselves. The constant denier whining about Mann's work has been debunked thoroughly: http://www.skepticalscience.com/broken-hockey-stick.htm So, again, unless you can come up with some real evidence or refutation for it, I will also mark this argument as ""bullshit"" and ignore it from now on. >This all changed with climate-gate.

That means things like forced taxes to build and maintain ""free access"" roads as opposed to the Libertarian ideal of a network of private toll roads of varying quality and cost to use them. That means discouraging risky behavior through taxes and regulation. That means having laws, trials, and punishment. That means having a democracy where not everything you want, you will get. People don't live in a vacuum; they live around and with other people. Where people can be left to their own devices, yes, I believe they should be free to do whatever they choose. However, when their activities intersect with / impinge on others, there MUST be a ""common ground"" established. Sometimes that means some personal freedoms get restricted. That's the price of living in a society with other people. Some things which benefit all are important and valuable enough to sacrifice a little personal liberty for.

I heartily encourage them (and you, if you are indeed one of them) to move there so they can live out their lives as they wish.

The important difference is that I am not ""robbing my fellow man"", I am subjugating myself alongside him so we both can have something better. However, if he chooses to take from the society without giving back its due, then yes, I support the use of force, because that's the contract.

It is simply a mathematical result based on the magnitude of the difference when compared to the calculated uncertainty. For 2010, this percentage was even less by a factor of 1.5 to 3 times. In short, they are significantly more certain that 2014 was a record year than 2010. What it means is this: the average over the globe results in a specific value. That value has a margin of error. The difference between the old record year (2010) and the new record year is very small, and COULD, if better data, or a more accurate method of analyzing it is discovered, prove that it isn't higher than 2010. Will that happen? Maybe. The point is that if it does, they will heartily revise and endorse the revision, not sweep it under the rug. That's science. It isn't perfect, but it always strives toward that lofty goal. To do otherwise isn't science. However, right now, and to the best of their combined knowledge and capability, this is what they have found. If you or anyone else wants to put forth a better analysis, then DO IT! Seriously. If it is indeed scientifically sound, I would expect it to supplant their efforts. However, it will have to run the gauntlet of skepticism, just like everything else, including their own work. I will also point out this little aside: ""(Contrary to some press reports, this was indeed fully discussed during the briefing)"". So it wasn't anything ""hidden"" from anyone. It was part of the announcement. What is so funny and sad about this whole thing is that people are looking at the minutiae and ignoring the real issue: the long-term trend. Even if 2014 is later revised to not being a ""record year"", it still will be one of the hottest years on record, just like almost all of them in the past decade. That's pretty damn significant, given the odds of that happening over the 20th century baseline is from 1.7 to 650 million to 1. Compared to those astronomical odds, 38% is a ""sure bet"".

Citation, please? From what I can tell, the claim is from a UK tabloid (the Daily Mail) from an unsourced quote, and is essentially being echoed by the denier blogosphere with no further exposition. Without context (and the actual quote), the claim is meaningless. It is easier to lie about statistics than it is to lie with statistics. It is well-known that there is and has always been a margin of error, however, you don't assume the error is correct, you assume your mainline data is correct, until there is evidence that a correction to it is necessary. If your doctor tells you that you have a 38% chance that you have bone cancer, do you just wave it off and say ""call me when it gets to 100%""? No, you investigate it further, and consider treatments in line with the probability. >In an examination of the raw numbers it turns out Gavin simply fabricated warm temperatures across huge areas like Greenland, where he had no actual thermometer data in December. Gavin showed much of western Greenland 1-2C above normal, when it was actually 2C below normal. Citation, please? Never mind, I found it. Was easy since you plagiarized Steven Goddard without citation. Thanks for that. So, the claim is that there are missing measurements over Greenland, in December, and he substitutes RSS satellite data (TLT channel, specifically, which STILL isn't surface temp) for it. >It doesn’t take a lot of that sort of cheating to get temperatures up 0.02 globally.﻿ OK, let's do some math. Let's say that Goddard is right. We can calculate the effect of that error at the most coarse level. Greenland is 0.425% of the Earth's surface. Divide that by 12 for the month of December only, and multiply by the max temp difference (Goddard's claim is 2C), and you get the ""adjustment"" for the average year anomaly, which is 0.000708 degrees C. So, at best, and all other things being equal (which is far from realistic), we're talking an effect on the yearly anomaly over an order of magnitude below significance. This also doesn't take into account the likelihood of underestimating temperatures over larger areas elsewhere, like parts of sub-Saharan Africa (which also has no data for December), making it a push. So, yeah, typical denier cherry-picks and hype over tempests in thimbles. If a tiny bit of second-grade math utterly destroys your argument, what do you really have left?

Why? Because there is no such thing as the ""perfect instrument"" or ""perfect environment"" for it to be placed in. There's always some kind of biasing error (often from multiple sources) which has to be accounted for in order to produce accurate measurement data. In the case of the UHI effect (which you seem to have a particular issue with, as you keep bringing it up), it has been thoroughly examined and accounted for in temperature analyses for YEARS. Also, copy/pasting Anthony Watts without attribution isn't going to win you any points here. Quite the opposite, in fact. Regarding the July 2012/1936 ""silent switcharoo"" that you denier idiots keep harping on about. NOAA clearly pointed out that it had changed to a newer and more accurate dataset in March 2014. As a result *SOME* previous statements were invalidated. Why didn't they go back and address them all in a big public disclosure? Because they are constantly updating and improving their measurement and analysis methodologies. If they had to go and make big public spectacles of everything that changed whenever they improved their science, they'd be spending more time doing PR than on improving their science. In short, there was absolutely nothing nefarious or improper about what they did, or the ensuing aftermath. Climate science denier bloggers had a field day with something that was obvious, easily explainable, and meant absolutely nothing to the actual science involved. Pretty typical modus operandi for them: cherry pick, lie, misinform, distort, and generally kick and scream over irrelevancies. I'd also like to point out the bleeding obvious about that particular tempest in a thimble: the temperatures in question are SOLELY for the continental US, *NOT* the entire globe. So, it is pointless to bring up in a discussion about ""global"" climate change. There are no ""hyped up claims"". There are facts. When it comes to science, there is nothing that isn't subject to future analysis and revision when better understanding of the world around us dictates it.

Yes, because the increasing global temperatures are making it one. Go figure. >Why? Because, once again, this isn’t the result of information gathered by NASA satellites (how much did taxpayers fork out for those), it comes from ground reporting stations. Yeah, funny thing; it turns out it is very difficult to drag a thermometer near the surface on a long tether from orbit. This is a typical error in a layman's understanding of temperature measurement. First, satellites do not measure surface temperature at all, they measure temperature in the troposphere and stratosphere, hundreds to thousands of meters above the surface. That is the main reason that satellite measurements are not directly comparable to surface temperature data. They are completely different methods used to actually measure the temperature, let alone analyze and process the data into an ""accurate"" and useful temperature record. Also, satellite temperature measurement has nowhere near the simultaneous coverage that networks of thousands of ground-based stations do. More data points = higher accuracy. The satellites we taxpayers paid for do many things, including indirect surface temperature measurements, so yeah, we're getting what we paid for there. As a taxpayer, I must say I am quite pleased with the work that NASA and NOAA have done with my money, but I also understand WHAT they did with it; something most people do not. >According to the satellite data 2010 was actually warmer, making 2014 far from the warmest year on record. First, which satellite data set are we talking about here? There are at least 5 different sets. Further, which measurement channel are we talking about? It makes a huge difference, as they are not all measuring the same thing. >Oh yes NOAA says June 2010 was the hottest month on record (to great fan fair) then has to retract the statement (as quietly as possible.) Why? They STILL say it. Doesn't look like they have retracted it at all: http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/global/2010/6 I think the better question is: why would you say something that clearly isn't true? >NOAA gets its temperature data from the Goddard Institute for Space Studies. The other way around, actually. GISS gets its temperature data from NCDC, which is operated/maintained by NOAA. If you can't even get THAT right... >However, there is a major problem with how GISS measures temperature in a very large region — the Arctic. The problem is that they don’t have any thermometers there. So they make it up. First, there ARE thermometers ""up there"", just not as many as there are in lower latitudes. Second, they don't ""make it up"", they use valid and proven statistical methods to extrapolate temperatures over a larger grid than in lower latitudes. This has been studied extensively and, while GISS fully acknowledges the issues with  the lack of a dense meteorological station grid in that region, it has been determined that their approach is accurate enough to be useful, hence: http://www.skepticalscience.com/print.php?r=288 ""Thus conclusions from an objective analysis of available data, and recent peer reviewed work, whether based on updated independent observations at various resolutions, or state of the art high resolution climate modeling using all available data sources, is that the Arctic is experiencing strong warming, roughly double the global average, and showing increasing surface temperature trends with higher latitude. Whilst some caution is advised by GISS in using the interpolated data in the Arctic region, it appears that GISS trends in the Arctic region as a whole are consistent with other high latitude data sets, and show similar trends (in terms of annual averaged values) with other data sets which cover the region above 80N."" >GISS uses a 1,200 kilometre smoothing for its data, meaning that the temperature reading for one thermometer is used as the temperature for a 1,200 kilometre box in all directions from that location. Actually, they use both a 1200km and a 250km grid extrapolation methods, however, in areas with few real measurements, it can be up to 1200km. >Of course if they used satellite data (from their own satellites) they couldn’t generate the sensationalist headlines that they desperately need. Satellite measurements at high latitudes are unreliable due to uncorrectable variations from sea ice and melt pools because of the nature of the sensor used (MSU - Microwave Sounding Unit), and are normally discarded. Also, again, satellite instruments do NOT measure surface temperatures. You can extrapolate surface temperatures from the MSU data, but the data itself mostly represents temperatures far above the surface. Thus, there is no attempt at ""sensationalist headlines"", at least no more than the data represents by itself. >This is nothing new. That is about the only true thing you have said so far, but not in the context you meant. It is nothing new because the climate is changing; the world is getting warmer, perhaps a bit slower right now than in the previous decade, but the laws of physics simply cannot be ignored or waved away with empty arguments. >In 2012 & with as little fanfare as possible, NOAA has corrected their erroneous claim in their 2012 State of the Climate Report that of 2012 as the warmest “La Niña year” on record. In fact NOAA has a well established history of making sensationalist claims & then quietly backing away from them. If you go to the very page you are referring to, that fact, and the reason behind it, are *prominently* posted at the TOP of the report: they switched to a MORE ACCURATE data set for determining what constitutes ""La Nina/El Nino"" years. Hence: http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/global/2012/13 So, basically, they improved their process and corrected their previous statements based on the improved process. They did it openly and prominently in the very report it applies to. It wasn't hidden or changed with no attribution. No, that's the denier modus operandi - to not admit or correct errors, then turn around and chide others for doing that very proper and ethical thing they refuse to do. >In other words the feed their army of useful idiots endless talking points on the taxpayers dime.﻿ As opposed to the useless morons who have no clue WTF they are talking about, including posting misinformation, lies, and distortions.

This seems to be becoming an annual event. What they’re really saying is that NASA & NOAA need to be eliminated as taxpayer funded organizations. Why? Because, once again, this isn’t the result of information gathered by NASA satellites (how much did taxpayers fork out for those), it comes from ground reporting stations. According to the satellite data 2010 was actually warmer, making 2014 far from the warmest year on record. Hmmm there’s something about the year 2010...what is it? Hmmm….. Oh yes NOAA says June 2010 was the hottest month on record (to great fan fair) then has to retract the statement (as quietly as possible.) Why?: NOAA gets its temperature data from the Goddard Institute for Space Studies. They calculate the average temperature of the Earth using data from land-based thermometers and ocean buoy and ship measurements of water temperature. However, there is a major problem with how GISS measures temperature in a very large region — the Arctic. The problem is that they don’t have any thermometers there. So they make it up. GISS uses measured temperature data from lower latitudes and then extrapolates them to the Arctic. Using this method, any readings warmer than average in the lower latitudes are pushed into the Arctic by a smoothing technique. GISS uses a 1,200 kilometre smoothing for its data, meaning that the temperature reading for one thermometer is used as the temperature for a 1,200 kilometre box in all directions from that location. Where there are more thermometers, the boxes overlap, and the readings of one thermometer are averaged with others around them. This reduces the effect of each individual thermometer. But in data-sparse regions, the value of one thermometer takes on a much greater value. Of course if they used satellite data (from their own satellites) they couldn’t generate the sensationalist headlines that they desperately need. This is nothing new. In 2012 & with as little fanfare as possible, NOAA has corrected their erroneous claim in their 2012 State of the Climate Report that of 2012 as the warmest “La Niña year” on record. In fact NOAA has a well established history of making sensationalist claims & then quietly backing away from them. In other words the feed their army of useful idiots endless talking points on the taxpayers dime.",UCIt_7AOwyTvX0TdcOC-c1fQ,1,UgiXg1cLW3Ko7ngCoAEC,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

I have done extensive research on the topic for my degree as well as have joined Wolf-Pac in my state. Although an article 5 convention sounds like a hail mary, Wolf-Pac has had success in 3 states so far in passing resolutions to overturn Citizens United. As well as getting resolutions at least to committee in 12 other states. I think that the interesting thing is that public opinion tends to lean towards clean energy, assuming the cost isn't put on them (interestingly enough.) But with big business not only controlling politicians but the political discourse in this country, I fear that there is going to be little to nothing we can do even with overturning citizens united that would bring Americans back to a level of sane thought. Think about it, even if we get fair elections, whats the only place that big business can then control congress... through the media and owning media organizations. But even if they weren't to go out and invest in media, there is still a mass media bias that is typically in favor of corporations. I think it was chomsky that brought this point up... The only thing that can control a Democracy is the propaganda that the constituents are given. Even if it's slight, it's still there. I plan to write an extensive paper on the issues with legislating political speech not only on the federal level, but also the state level. A point i hope to make in the paper is that the mass media monopoly in this country needs to be broken down. That's the only way that overturning citizens united can be effective. Because then political discourse shifts away from mass media and into new media. Give individuals a choice and they're going to pick the populist/progressive ideology. But back to global warming. There are several issues i have with denying it besides the neglect of the date. 1) We are going to run out of oil regardless. 2) The repercussions of non-action could be catastrophic. 3) America could use this to help in an economic boom. (this of course would take a multi layered solution such as subsidizing companies to start up and become energy efficient.) I think that the biggest problem i have with it being called a hoax, is that big business (the Koch Bro's, big oil, etc) has done a good job at creating enough backlash to stop legislation from happening. In other words, they created a successful propaganda campaign. Look back to the ozone scare. It didn't take long for legislation to pass to remove the chemical in aerosol spray cans to be removed (not sure what chemical it was,) and the problem was solved, no more issue with the ozone. But there isn't anyone who agrees with climate change who stands to profit from it, gore already profited lol. Big business stands the most to lose. ",UCKsguOhuSm9bh7LOrgrC6KQ,1,UgiXg1cLW3Ko7ngCoAEC,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

Germany is currently running at 25% clean energy, and Denmark is at 50%, and these were not long programs to institute. but in the states, there will be no massive government push. the only precedent in history that illustrates a populist uprising influencing government policy in the US is ....the civil rights movement and the abolitionists. and both came at the high cost of violent protest and what I don't think anyone is willing to do, (yet anyways) namely sustained direct activism. But even in cases like the abolition movement, swaying government policy in writing is one thing, defeating the entrenched industries the government represents is a whole different matter entirely. in the end there were no reparations,  no ""40 acres and a mule,"" but huge pay outs were made to wealthy slave owners in the south to satiate the business class' losses. to achieve the end goal, ""to make humanity work to the benefit of everyone, to the detriment of no one,""  is at this point an impossible feat. without a united, informed citizenry, these conversations will always be on message boards.

I don't think Ghandi's brilliant maxim ""be the change you want to be in the world"" is appropriate for the climate situation anymore. I have a great article here somewhere.....ah! here you go. https://www.greenleft.org.au/node/55345 btw i'm not left or right, I just like to know what's going on and the most empirical data is not re-assuring.

Your assessment that ""it's got more ice than in 2008"" is based on an incomplete reading of the data. While 2013 was at a comparable level to 2008, the sea ice extent in the years in between was clearly lower (I'm using the NSIDC-data and the familiar trend graph you can find here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_sea_ice_decline). And of course the trend since the 1970 is clearly down. In fact, even the ""highs"" of 2008 and 2013 were actually lows - some 2.5 million square kilometers of sea ice has been lost since 1978, of a then total of around 8 million square kilometers. Your hopeful highs of 2008 and 2013 are at 5.5 million sq.km - not very impressive, and there has been less ice in other years.

In &#39;78 scientists were talking about the &quot;coming Ice Age&quot; (see it on Youtube, titled The Coming Ice Age - 1978 and narrated by Leonard Nimoy), then it was &quot;global warming&quot; which was tempered by the more pc phrase &quot;climate change,&quot; which is a silly term, for when isn&#39;t the climate changing? Also consider that Mr. Inconvenient Truth was telling us some 15+ years ago that by 2014 the Polar Ice Caps would have melted. Well, they&#39;re getting larger Al. Also, take into consideration that what science knows empirically only began in the 60s with opportunity for regular and specific observation. Before that it was guess work or looking at a complex system (the climate) and determine specific outcomes. What people don&#39;t understand is the real question at hand: Are humans GREATLY responsible for any considerable change in climate? Well, they are responsible for some change, that&#39;s not debatable, but change to the degree that an entire race may be wiped out? If you know complex systems and their predictability, then you know such outcomes are ALWAYS open to debate. And getting solidly behind one philosophy or another is dangerous business, for even scientists don&#39;t have the knowledge-base or the ability to predict specific, long-term outcomes, for if they did, why were they predicting an Ice Age in the 70s, Global Warming in the 80s-90s, and now Climate Change. And finally, even if we are changing the climate, to stop it you&#39;ll have to be a part of the monetary elite, who, by the way, make a LOT of money off of the way things are now.

Not so different in the USA.. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolitionism "" The first attempts to end slavery in the British/American colonies came from Thomas Jefferson and some of his contemporaries. Despite the fact that Jefferson was a lifelong slaveholder, he included strong anti-slavery language in the original draft of the Declaration of Independence, but other delegates took it out.[38] Benjamin Franklin, also a slaveholder for most of his life, was a leading member of the Pennsylvania Society for the Abolition of Slavery, the first recognized organization for abolitionists in the United States.[39] Following the Revolutionary War, Northern states abolished slavery, beginning with the 1777 constitution of Vermont, followed by Pennsylvania's gradual emancipation act in 1780. Other states with more of an economic interest in slaves, such as New York and New Jersey, also passed gradual emancipation laws, but by 1804, all the northern states had abolished it. Some slaves continued in servitude for two more decades but most were freed.  "" PS: The original drafts of the Declaration of Independence can be found here: http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/declara/ruffdrft.html  ~~~~~ Do you think the Americans people in the north who would have given their lives to end slavery in the war between the states, were any different than Americans who fought for freedom from King George?

Obamas term started which all the problems the bush administration left him with; meaning Abu Graib, Guantanamo, the Iraq and Afghanistan war and a huge deficite. I don't think the average us- citizen can grasp how much that and the bush administration had hurt the credibility and image of the US. The US basically became a parody of itself and their values and Guantanamo a symbol for western double standards. Guantanamo means extraterritorial prisons without any rights to defend themself. They aren't convicted criminals, because there is no court. This untermines the most fundamental human rights. Of course there was bloodlust for revenge, but to get right of your constitution? I thought the constitution is something the USA holds deer. A question might be ask why the US criticize China but they cope with political enemies like third world countries would do. And what about the hunt of wistleblowers with questionable methods? 9/11 changed the US to the worse. I'm from Europe, believe me I don't blame just the US, but we remembered when parts of Europe had been ridiculed and called ""old europe"" to belittle there importance and criticizing them for their anti-war policy. And we are forgiving, when we had high hopes the USA of Obama will be different. These hopes have been crushed, but not by a discontinuation because there is more of the same. In the arab world that might have even resonated more, on top of the unconditioned support of Israel. What you are suggesting is just crazy. You want even more US intervention ""cuz other countries might think we are weak."". The ucraine was invaded for many reasons, a weak US president is not that reason. The US and Europe were to naive in that issue. The only mistake Obama made in foreign policy is, that the didn't attack ISIS or Syria early enough before the rebels got radicalized into ISIS early enough and that western countries tried to cooperate with Asad. But Obamas ""no infantery"" policy is sound policy. Help some countries with airstrikes, but they should clean up their own mess by sending infantery. What you are suggesting is even more expensive and needs even more clean-ups. Sending weapons to the western Ucraine will only invite russia to openly support eastern ucraine. They even get a justification to support russian citizens there. And what you've said about China is wrong as well. It is in the interests of the US to seperate russia from Europe, at least they have acted that way. Your ""fuck the EU"" expert even alluded to CIA influence in the Maidan uprising. China and Russia had negotiated for a decade on oil deals. Russia, after this whole mess, was desperate to agreed to a not so great deal and a huge deal for China. But this doesn't  impact the US economy in any way. Europe is fucked now. What Obama should have done: Close the shame of Guantanamo for good. The creation of it was illegal, don't try to legally close something illegal. Just close it and be done with it- Negotiate a peace agreement between the palestinians and Israel. If Israel is unwilling to stop the illegal settlements, stop military spending of 3 billion, they are a developed country now anyway and don't need that money. The crazy arab world will lose a major reason to hate the US, which is unwilling to unconditionally support unjustified policies by Israel.

You use generalizations and broad strokes to paint everything black and white. You use this oversimplification to differantiate, but is shallow method to justify you're idiology. State regulation = communist = north korea and China etc. Small state = good. When the US have on of the most expensive health care system and many can't afford it? You can't deny that the regulations by markets itself, have their limits, right? You don't have to look at ""communists"" countries to find countries with health care systems far better than that of the US. There are good arguments for state interventions and some against it, it's called priorities. Companies and states have different objectives and priorities, sometimes they converge, but not all the time. Most of the small state supporters preach  that private companies are more ""efficient"". In what exactly? Maximing profits of course. When it is about critical infrastructure like water, health, electricity and so on, privatisazions might lead to problems (Doesn't mean federaly managed companies are always better because of human error). You can't argue there are times when markets fail right? Then suddenly it's the job of states to clean up that mess? But I thought there does not need to be state intervention because markets regulate themself? The priority of states should of course be to not intervent in individual lives but making sure the majority have access to affordable and important goods and services should be state priority as well. When you have 47 million people who aren't insured, that should ring the alambell. The US's laissez-faire economic liberalism only works when there is no discrimination and everyone have equal opportunities and access to education and success when he just tries hard enough. But that is just rhetoric nowadays. So what happens to the ""losers"" of society? Should they just die? Even when they are denied access to health services they cause indirect costs anyway. And these costs would be smaller were they insured. The EMTALA act was caused by the structural problems of the health care system. Many problems of the US are caused by this thinking of social darwinism. Even if you don't agree to the implementation, the problem of the US health system is the number of people not insured , costs and that many (well-paid) insurance companies deny services which might even result in financial ruin. Working on real problems impacting your citizen is actually a sound policy. ""The U.S. Census Bureau reported that 49.9 million residents, 16.3% of the population, were uninsured in 2010 (up from 49.0 million residents, 16.1% of the population, in 2009). A 2004 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report said: ""The United States is among the few industrialized nations in the world that does not guarantee access to health care for its population."" A 2004 OECD report said: ""With the exception of Mexico, Turkey, and the United States, all OECD countries had achieved universal or near-universal (at least 98.4% insured) coverage of their populations by 1990.""""(wikipedia) Even guys preaching this blamed Obama when they'd losed their job and wanted the extention of unemployment pay. The US health system is way more expensive than the OECD standard. You now why? Most of it is administration costs and lack of competition. You have just to look at the facts and see there had to be some reform. I think you don't fully understand Obamacare because of your ideological blindfolds. Obama is a communist for reforming the health system? Didn't you even jive at his religion? Obama did in many ways continue Bush's policy, especially in his foreign policy. The republicans won't officially say it out loud though, there have to be ass-pulled facts to attack. What Chomky is arguing here is about the influence of lobby groups influencing a political discourse. Are you arguing against it or do you just deny that something called ""human caused global warming"" does exist? You haven't stated that clearly.

Clinton, like Obama, APPEARED to be the kind of ""statesman type"" we all longed for after Bush1, but if you look at their policies, and business connections, the Clintons and the Bush family are pretty close. also, there is no brick wall when you have executive privilege. the worst that COULD have happened would've been his chief staff quitting, but JFK faced that and far more and used his power to 1)fire the head of the CIA, (Allan Dulles, who would later, ironically, head the warren commission, though he openly hated ""that smug son of a bitch Kennedy."") who was a intelligence sacred cow at the time of the bay of pigs disaster, after JFK went on tv to accept responsibility, he eliminated the CIA's ability to run covert ops without his knowledge, and that the CIA, not the presidency, would be accountable for failures like the bay of pigs from there on. now that alone earned him enough enemies to get himself killed. There's a great quote, after the bay of pigs JFK lamented to his younger brother ""it was my fault.

I witnessed the demise of “family farms” and the rise of HUGE “corporate farms”. Was that sad? Yes! But, the byproduct was fewer people needed to produce so much more product. (Food’s never been cheaper…and more widely distributed - worldwide.) “Change” is inevitable…for better or worse.  I did, however, notice some interesting things about folks living on family farms. Even though I was raised in a rural Iowa setting…I was not raised on a farm. As a kid, I hunted and trapped (yes, I trapped fur bearing animals). I noticed that farm owners knew MUCH LESS about their natural surroundings…than me (just a damn kid). I always found that to be odd. How could a complete outsider (kid) know more about nature and wildlife…than the people who actually lived amongst all this stuff…24/7? The answer was…they made their living off the land. They concentrated solely on agricultural procedures…and by default…ignored everything that they deemed not directly connected to tilling the soil. (An inherent fault of “human nature”). Over the years, I’ve seen that change…despite corporate ownership of most lands…folks are now more aware of long term ramifications of farming procedures and have actually changed for the better. Life’s complicated. I’ve always been results oriented and I’ve traveled the world a bit. I’ve been in third world countries and western countries. I’ve been exposed to a number of cultures. And, speaking from a purely objective point of view…America, with all of her faults, is indeed an amazing place.  Overall, with all things considered, our nation is STILL an absolutely amazing place to live…due entirely to the forethought of our founding fathers…even with all of their faults.

Until every 'man' can take care of himself in that same regard, without having to worry about being taxed on his land in at least if a bulk of food is produced, i can't see humanity going anywhere. (this is also a much deeper topic in the ways of sustainable agriculture mostly removed of machinery and monocultures) You had just said it, you witnessed this thing for decades, the pursuit of wealth is a solitary thing, in that no other pursuits can be had when wealth is the goal, wealth in regards to currency.  The world isn't suppose to be ugly, thats a human construct we need to move away from.  We have a long enough human history of rolling through these schemes in and out, nothing we are facing right now is new.  This scheme of stabbing each other in the back to keep this insane wheel of consumption rolling is crazy. In fact, capitalism is based upon consumption, which is funny because in this system, conservatism isn't even a reality because consumption based models require constant spending(consumption) in order to persist.  my point is not that ""this"" political system is worse or better than ""that"" political system, its just as i've been saying, the basis for humanity is backwards. this earth is a beautiful place and i just wish everyone could see that, but these concrete jungles make it hard to see, and not such a long time ago it was a metaphoric garden of eden, there isn't any reason the world can't be that way again but our model of living doesn't support that.  like i was saying, until the consciousness of man changes away from this mindset of consumption, constant increase in items and possessions, new better faster bigger, we are in trouble. on climate change, climate change isn't necessarily even an issue in regards to things like soil loss. the issues created from soil loss ffaarr outweigh many other issues. the focus on real problems is never highlighted so that the energy of people is always drawn to cyclic issues. these issues span centuries and beyond so the solutions are merely a part of a system, not actual solutions. illusions for day to day life in this current way humanity occupies. on the issue of politics and governance however, i think this stem in this cycle we are currently in will not change until people live in a way that is independent of the cycle. global economics does not mean a thing for the vast majority of people, it merely deepens the pockets of the very few, but because humanity if reliant on said system, there isn't much to be done about it.  This is exactly why independant, 'isolated' systems and counties are always portrayed as evil and degenerate because they are very difficult to exploit. if the entire world was that way then there would be no room for exploitation. the human body works much the same way, its not about curing a disease, its about creating an environment in which disease has no room to exist, and, in fact agriculture is or should be that same way. Creating an agricultural system in which fertility is build in and diversity exists so that pests and disease have no place to take hold. these patterns of life are largely ignored.",UC4qJ7BmcaPGzcD807o5mF0g,1,Ughk0I9yXQvH5HgCoAEC,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

Or CO2 doesn't cause warming effect?"" Humans have not influenced the increase in global temps considerably nor have we increased CO2 significantly in terms of the historic CO2 concentrations of the earth. There were times when CO2 reached over 30% of the atmosphere and species did not die off. Compare that to the current 0.03% of the atmosphere that CO2 currently is. This present inter-glacial we are in is cooler than the previous 3 the earth has seen over 350000 years. So the cycle is normal and expected. CO2 increases are normal and expected with an increase in global temps and 2013 has come and gone and we still have our ice caps despite the AL Gores and chicken lickens who said otherwise. We have actually had record high antarctic ice extents and a higher than normal arctic ice cover in 2014. So much for the flimsy correlation between CO2 levels and global temps. You:""What you said is correct but isn't revalant to recent rise because the cycle is affected by ""new"" amplified forces caused by humans"" That is an opinion. The evidence doesn't show any such link between human activity and the interglacial cycle. When you show me actual verifiable evidence of this I will believe. You:""Humans add extra CO2 so the levels are rising"" Adding 3% to the 0.03% of the atmos that is CO2 has proved to be insignificant. besides this we have no way of knowing what parts of the atmospheric CO2 are due to human activity or due to the liberation of oceanic CO2 due to the temperature fluctuations.Oceans and plants absorb CO2 so human activity and CO2 levels will not necessarily follow a linear relationship unless you ""want"" them to. You:""Ozone forms even smaller percentage of the atmosphere than CO2 but without it we would recieve lethal doses of radiation"" Ozone is not CO2. Ozone has the effect of tint on shades. It doesn't have to be thick to work. CO2 however is a different substance with different properties. It is a minor greenhouse gas still even at an incredible 0.03% of the atmosphere and the figures already show that it will (possibly) increase to 1 degree C in 100 years if we sut down the whole planet.....seriously? You think 1 degree C is worth the death and destruction that will ensue by shutting down a world which depends heavily on fossil fuels? Only privileged people believe these things methinks. You:"" The ""myth"" is created by ""sceptics"" by feeding incomplete conclusions and spreading false information."" All real scientists are SKEPTICS. They question everything. There are tens of thousands of scientists who don't believe in AGW. There is no consensus and even if there was it would not make AGW true. Science is not decided by consensus but by evidence and the scientific method. AGW has never passed the scientific method. When you believe something (like AGW) blindly based on the authority of a handful of celebrated and highly paid scientists and politicians that is when you are a fundamentalist religious fanatic.

So you are saying that the rate of increase of CO2 in the atmos has something to do with human emmissions since around 1800 correct? That's wrong friend. In science correlation is not equal to causation. Here's why: http://theresilientearth.com/files/images-2011/interglacial_temps-petit.png The present interglacial period (which is in fact cooler by a few degrees C than the past 3 interglacials) is marked by an increase in global temperature due to the orbit of the earth. This happens every 120,000 to years or so. It is natural and has been happening since the earth was formed. The increase in CO2 you are seeing in your graph there is due to the mass liberation of CO2 from the oceans as the temperature of the earth increases (recall that CO2 is not as soluble in water at higher temperatures). So you are looking at an effect (release of CO2) as a cause of temperature increase when it's actually the other way around. In any event, human activity could not likely be the driver of such a drastic increase in atmospheric CO2 as is shown in your graph since humans only contribute mere 3% of the total CO2 in the atmosphere. Recall that CO2 makes up less than 0.04% of the atmosphere. Do you know what 0.04% of 3% gives you? That is how small our contribution of CO2 is to the total amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. Now according to the climate scientists who believe in AGW the most generous estimate of how much we can reduce the global temperature by in stopping all human activity is 1 degree C over a 100 year period. So even if AGW was true and we could reduce the earth's temp by 1degree (which is nothing relatively) in 100 years, do you know how many people will die and suffer if all fossil fuel burning is stopped? All third world countries for certain and many first world ones too. And all for what? A myth which is as yet still unsupported by empirical data?

Solar average activity has levelled and fallen a bit from the middle of the last century. "" 1) There has not been any recent warming. The global temps actually have been following solar activity as the actual DATA shows that there has been no statistical warming since 1998. What happening in 1998? El Nino. What is happening again? El Nino. Therefore if there are any increases in global temps El Nino is most likely the culprit. DO we have any control over El Nino? Nope. So what you are fussing about is really a non issue and being made into one by people who want to see the third world stay poor while a few rich people pocket billions from carbon taxation. Check the link I sent you and plot the data yourself. It's not rocket science but those who have their own agendas want you to trust in their opinions over the data because they THINK you are too stupid to see they are lying. 2) Some scientists have been caught with their hand in the proverbial cookie jar this year manipulating climate data to make it seem as though there is more warming than there is. Also NOAA has embarked upon an exercise to ""correct"" previously corected data showing zero warming for the last 17 years. All this despite the fact the up to last year the IPCC admitted that there has been zero statistical warming over the last 15+ years. Why all this effort if the evidence was there to begin with of anthropogenic climate change? Money.... You:""Water vapor is controlled by the temperature, that is high school stuff."" And so is CO2. It's called a cycle for a reason. It is all driven by solar activity. Water vapor IS a greenhouse gas just like CO2. However water vapor is a major greenhouse gas and CO2 is a minor one. Just to tell you how insignificant the human contribution of CO2 is did you know that with the most generous calculations for CO2 emissions and temperature increase if ALL human activity was to stop for 100 years we would ""possibly"" move the global temperature down by 1 degree C? Is that worth killing off millions of people due to lack of infrastructure and basic amenities which are heavily dependent upon fossil fuels? It is not practical, feasible, humane nor sensible apart from being unscientific friend. You:""http://www.skepticalscience.com/trend.php Calculate your 17 year trend yourself. It's positive."" LOL. OMG. 1) . Skeptical science is a shill and propaganda website. The owner and author of most of the articles is not a climate scientist. He is a physics major. They do not present an objective view of climate science as a real science website would do and only participates in special pleading, AGW apologetics and global warming advocacy. 2) I cannot get the calculator to work but I will assume that the results it generates will be from a climate model and not be reflective of the actual data since the actual data is available in HADCRUT 4 online already. Classic AGW advocacy. The problem is that the climate models have been failing consistently. Still the AGW alarmists rely on these over the actual collected data. This is contrary to the scientific method and just plain common sense. 3) For a positive trend to be observed climate science at the time of writing requires that the average change in temperature by greater than 0.6 Degrees over a 15 year period. This has not been the case and therefore there has been zero statistical warming over the period 2000 to now for example. Do you know what the increase in the global temperature was earlier this year? something like 0.0002 degree increase over last year. Oooo. 4) The argument that skeptical science and other shill sites make is that EL Nino gave the ""appearance"" of a slowdown (which is stupid because instruments that measure temperature detect the ACTUAL temperature so the word appearance is misleading and an unscientific argument. If it didn't really slow down of plateau then the instruments measuring it would say so. THey didn't. 5) Now that we have another El Nino this year why are they acting as though temperatures are still increasing this year instead of calling 2015 at oulier as they love to do for the El Nino of 1998? You:""Scientists didn't mention ice age, they only mentioned that solar activity was predicted to fall. How does that in any way contradict the notion that heightened consentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere will cause more heat to be trapped? It doesn't."" They term Ice age is used to indicate that global temperatures are expected to decrease significantly enough to cause ice and snow to form in regions of the world which have not seen such in centuries. I agree that more CO2 in the atmos will cause more heat to be trapped but there is not a linear relationship between CO2 concentration and global temps as the alarmists would have us believe. There have been times in our Earth's history when CO2 concentrations were near 30% of the atmosphere yet the global temperature was not raised by this. If you look at the data you will see that as solar activity and other forcings increase the global temperatures increase and THEN more CO2 is liberated from the oceans giving the illusion that the CO2 increased the temps but the opposite is true. It is the temps that cause a massive increase in atmospheric CO2. If you love science check out the uncorrected datasets from HADCRUT 4. If you are lazy then you can listen to Lord Monkton to dispel some of these myths that we have been led to believe by people who are responsible for generating more CO2 daily than most of us will in a lifetime. They are laughing at us. You:""Show me a scientist who says that climate is controlled only by CO2? "" I can't. Most scientists know the climate is controlled ultimately by the sun. And we have no control over that. http://www.petitionproject.org/ You:""The raw data has to be corrected for biases"" Yes of course. Biases should be demostrated and the corrections justified. I have seen no evidence that any corrections were due to poor placement of meters and the like. These things are carried out very carefully to begin with but for the right price any excuse can be found. It simply isn't true. Scientist who don't believe in human caused global warming (and there are many btw) have nothing good to benefit from showing the evidence in support of their position. They are however vilified, ridiculed and denied funding for speaking out against the climate gestapo which collects hundreds of millions of dollars in funding by the US and UN for ""climate research"".

Which is why the AGW propaganda machine is so heavily funded...to convince us that despite contrary data the earth is actually warming because our scientists say so. In science qualifications and consensus (although AGW has none) mean nothing. THe only thing that matters is empirical evidence. If there was any of it compelling enough to support AGW I would definitely be on board with AGW. Sorry but it's not. You:""And the temperature trend is positive.

But I say you are using argument by authority as well because you are seeking to justify a position based on the highly decorated and acclaimed and qualified people who hold it also. This is not only an invalid argument but it also intellectually dishonest. You:""Galileo is a poor example. First, he was trying to convince the church"" Not exactly. Galileo's heliocentric theory was at variance with the scientific opinion of his contemporaries. As far as religion is concerned Galileo had been assured by Pope Urban VIII that he could consider heliocentrism hypothetically, but until he could prove it (which he could not), he was not to PROMOTE it as fact and then USE it to FORCE the Church to CHANGE ITS INTERPRETATION OF SCRIPTURE. He disobeyed; and for his disobedience (not his science), he was brought before the Inquisition. So yes he was trying to convince the church to CHANGE it's theological position (not it's scientific position) on geocentrism. In fact Galileo was not the first to have proposed the heliocentric theory. It was as old as Copernicus if not older. You:"" it was before the age of enlightenment and the modern scientific method."" It's relative friend. The men of that age would have felt the same when comparing their scientific method to older ones as well. Since even the modern scientific method is not foolproof in finding out the truth of anything beyond the shadow of a doubt either the analogy is still quite apt in my opinion. Besides I have not yet seen those advocating AGW properly engaging the scientific method in providing empirical evidence of human caused global warming. Have we seen any repeatable experiments that have conclusively proved that it is man made CO2 that is driving climate change? Have we seen proof that the 0.028% of the total CO2 footprint that we emit has caused significant warming? No. Global surface temps have been stagnant for 17 going on 18 years now.",UCyRan6s1-LWKXBVY2VicHyg,1,UgicRAE8L0q5aHgCoAEC,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

The reduced trend in radiative forcing is primarily due to volcanic eruptions and the downward phase of the current solar cycle. However, there is low confidence in quantifying the role of changes in radiative forcing in causing this reduced warming trend. {Box 9.2; 10.3.1; Box 10.2}” The mean global temperature could not be increasing while the surface temperatures remained unaffected especially over a 15 year period.

First let me share this link with you in case you want to read it. http://www.aip.org/history/climate/20ctrend.htm Now on to the main point. I don't know if people know this or not, so I will repeat it here. As we know CO2 is a greenhouse gas that is one of many byproducts from hydrocarbon combustion (depending on the type of reaction). We will focus on CO2. CO2 then enters the atmosphere, but this is where things get interesting. CO2 is absorbed by the ocean which in turn causes an acidification of the ocean (which causes the degradation of calcium shelled animals at certain depths). So if the ocean didn't absorb CO2, we would be in a much graver situation. In addition, the ocean also absorbs heat. Check out these sites for a better explanation. If you don't believe me, then take a look at the literature with an open mind.   http://phys.org/news/2013-10-pacific-ocean-absorbing-faster-years.html http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/co2/story/Ocean+Carbon+Uptake",UCttJJjAPKAECPq12UAZKKWg,1,UgjZVjg58YJ_J3gCoAEC,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

Also, I followed your debate with Steven Bee and I have to admit that Steven has made several logical fallacies. However, I can't find a way to fully agree with you either.

You mention there is a rise of 0.6 °C since 1996 and how that is insufficient to consider that to be part of global warming. I'm looking at a graph right now with data of several organizations plotted from 1950 to 2010 and it shows a rise of 1 °C, which has been ascribed to global warming. Where did you get the idea that 0.6 °C over 18 years can be ignored? And what about 1 °C over 60 years? And what about the notion that while the temperature has increased by 1 °C in 60 years, 60% of that increase has occurred in the last 30% of that timescale? Let me know how you make sense of such data. I suppose I'm open to the possibility that global warming is a hoax, but I deem it to be extremely unlikely.

If also instead of pointing out the flaws in the mad man's calculations and observations a large group of scientists point out that he is wearing his pants inside out and that their investigation reveals that his mother was a crack addict.

And even if you did show this it would prove nothing since correlation is not equal to causation. All climate scientists understand that as temperatures rise CO2 levels rise as the seas liberate more CO2 and as temperatures rise cloud cover increases and therefore more solar radiation is reflected back out to space and less enters our atmosphere. The data shows that the 0.04% that CO2 represents in the atmosphere is really negligible in causing any significant global temperature rise. There have been higher CO2 levels before. As much as 38% CO2 in the earth's history and life thrived during these times. Increased CO2 un to 1500 ppm are good for plants and given higher yields. Warmer climates are desirable. Also like I keep pointing out to you fossil fuel burning or not global temperatures would have been what it is today anyway since we are at the peak of the present interglacial.

But all this must sound like greek to you since you by your own admission are ill equipped to even look at the data and will defer all your opinions even about basic mathematics to climate scientists who are pro AGW.

You are ignorant. You:"" Consensus among the entire globe's leading experts in a field gives HUGE weight to the likelihood that it is correct."" No. It is unwise and illogical to lean on consensus of opinion of ANYONE (not mater how qualified) when you have data that suggests that this opinion is wrong. This is precisely what raises eyebrows for anyone who can think critically. What you are suggesting is unscientific and illogical. You are ignorant. You:""therefore statistics and professional qualifications mean nothing so long as there is 1 dissenting voice"" No. Statistics that involves CLIMATE DATA mean everything and trump statistics of OPINION by scientists and the qualifications that these scientists hold altogether. It is not the dissenting voice(s) that decide fact or fiction but the evidential support for the hypothesis. How does the number of votes cast for an idea prove that the idea is true or false? By your logic slavery was OK until it became unfashionable. You are ignorant. You:"" You have 99 cardiac specialists who've looked at your readings and tell you that you must undergo immediate surgery to prevent a heart attack"" Using equivocation does not prove you are right. What you have not said is that those cardiac specialists understand fully the workings of the system (human heart) and have seen the evidence and can reproduce the evidence to support their claim that surgery is required. You are asking people to trust a body which receives funding from politicians (IPCC) when they say that the scientific community who agrees with AGW is even more certain (95% certain) about AGW even though their predictions have fallen even further from the actual observed data this last time than the previous report. You are asking people to believe a body of work which is based upon computer models which have consistently failed to predict what is observed. You are asking people to trust an idea even though it cannot be backed up by actual data but is only believed by ""a lot of smart people"". That is what religion is my friend. You are ignorant. 2) Even thought these 99 cardiac specialists have more understanding and predictive powers in their field on the human heart thanks to the empirical evidential support for same. Even though this is the case they do not determine how countries spend their money or burnt their fuels or what fuels they use without being vilified or penalized for doing so as does the Kyoto protocol. Therefore in the case of the heart patient, this patient can very well die due to the oversight of these cardiac specialists and the world will go on. We are not going to hinge global economic and geo political policy on the beliefs of 99 cardiac surgeons even though they have more evidence to support their opinions than do the climatologists and scientists who the IPCC farms for information. According to the IPCC's actual data they are LESS certain about climate change than before. Look at the figures yourself. If you took the time to look at the data to see if even a rise or fall in temperature was discernible then you would agree that the IPCC and those who agree with AGW are mistaken. In other words if you take a non religious approach to AGW then popular vote and authority mean less to you when analyzing AGW.",UCyRan6s1-LWKXBVY2VicHyg,1,UggdLbnMET5R9HgCoAEC,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

Cherry-picking would be to select a start and end point that yield the desired results, like your misleading source does.  Deniers typically start with the exceptional El Nino year of 1998, or even a particular month of that El Nino, in late 1997, to misrepresent the trend. And that's just surface temps.  Warming continues, with most of it continuing to go into the oceans, as usual.  And the period of no surface warming is not much different from the previous periods in the 1980s and 1990, which were clearly not the end of warming. Here is a more thorough analysis showing that warming has continued: http://tamino.wordpress.com/2014/01/30/global-temperature-the-post-1998-surprise/ Here is wikipedia's definition of cherry picking: ""Cherry picking, suppressing evidence, or the fallacy of incomplete evidence is the act of pointing to individual cases or data that seem to confirm a particular position, while ignoring a significant portion of related cases or data that may contradict that position. It is a kind of fallacy of selective attention, the most common example of which is the confirmation bias. [1] Cherry picking may be committed intentionally or unintentionally."" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_picking_%28fallacy%29 Cherry picking can lead to all kinds of technically true, but misleading statements.  Like, ""1900-2000 had 0.56 C warming. 2000-2010 had 0.26 C warming, or 2.6 C per century, which is 4.6 times the rate of the 20th century.""  Here's the graph.  Check my numbers: http://climate.nasa.gov/key_indicators#globalTemp That's an example of cherry picking.  It's misleading, and dishonest.  And it sure was easy, using real facts.

It's probably the most international problem ever, because it affects every country and is also being caused by them all (although to very varying degrees on both counts). Dumping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is called an externality. A cost of an economic activity, borne by someone else. Regulations are often used to make businesses pay for their costs rather than externalising them. Cap and trade is a ""laissez faire market"" approach to solving global warming, but in reality it has not worked at all (in Europe) but has been good for number-twiddling bankers.

Which is ridiculous to you and me, but I think that's the line of thinking. His thoughts are clearly focused on the policy implications of climate change. For this reason he denies the science, and cannot see that it's a separate matter. It's this kind of mindless oppositionism that has American politics so messed up.

In the graph on the website I linked to you will see that earth has continued to warm since 1998 - substantially so! But the heat has gone into the oceans and not the atmosphere.

There is some loss in the system mainly at the bottom of the oceans and the main long term source of new Co2 is volcanoes there are slow changes in these process over millennia that affect long term climate change and one of the few things that deniers say, that is actually true is that these natural release do indeed dwarf human Co2 emissions.  While land based life releases ~440 Gt a year this is matched by the Co2 absorbed each year by photosynthesis. The same is true of the oceans were it is ~330Gt both emitted and absorbed, in a cycle. Volcanoes add fresh Co2 to the system, over the recent history that we have records for we know this has been around 0.3Gt per year. Then we came along and over the last century started burning ever growing amounts of fossil fuels, coal, gas, oil and most recently petroleum) all of this is Co2 that has not been in the atmosphere since before the time of the dinosaurs. The current rate of human emissions is around 30 Gt per year and growing. That is 100x the volcanic contribution and a little less than 5% of the above natural cycle figures of that ~5% figure around 40% has been absorbed by the oceans which has in turn lead to the ocean acidification problem, the remainder has gone into the atmosphere and this is reflected by the rise in atmosphere Co2 levels by nearly 40% taking atmospheric Co2 well above levels (based on ice and sediment core) seen in the last half a million years. Air sampling has proved that most of the increase in Co2 in the atmosphere is the product of the burning of fossil fuels as it has a different isotope markers to Co2 from volcanic origins  http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11638-climate-myths-human-co2-emissions-are-too-tiny-to-matter.html  The above is based on information from a rage of scientific fields Geology, Oceanography, Climate scientists, Glaciologists etc  One of the standing denier myths is that scientists are lying about all this for the funding, why would Vulcanologist lie they are funded to study volcanoes regardless of what happens with AGW we are still going to study volcanoes, they have no reason to lie and they are the ones who supply the info on volcanic activity. The same is true of the data on increased ocean Co2 levels causing acidification, this is coming from data gathered by oceanographers not climate scientists, again they don't stand to gain anything from climate science funding they are just doing their own long term research on oceans and have noted the change in pH.  But then I know for a fact the 'doing it for the funding story"" is a myth, the group I work for is funded by the Australian Govt over the last decade first under the Howard Govt (anti AGW) then the Rudd Govt (pro AGW) there were no funding increases there were real term reductions in funding, from visiting scientists from similar groups in Europe and the U.S. I know the situation there is much the same, the climate change gravy train that deniers talk about, is a total fabrication. 29% of the CO2 in the atmosphere is anthropogenic (about 112 out of 392 ppm).  Human fossil fuel emissions release carbon which had been stored for millions of years, throwing the carbon cycle out of balance. The largest source of anthropogenic CO2 is from energy production. ",UCeHO710sLvQS-scdYtHeAjg,1,UgjaxexSHWMLdHgCoAEC,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

Sorry, but you laid yourself wide open to that one. You will find, if you really want to educate yourself about climate change, that anthropogenic CO2 plays a much smaller role in climate change than we are all constantly being told by the mainstream media and the IPCC.  Natural factors such as the sun's radioactive output and oceanic circulation play a much bigger role and always have done, which is why we had sustained warming of the planet during medieval times when there was no industrial activity for example, and a 30 year period of cooling from 1946 to 1978 even though this was a period of booming industrial activity. Today, despite rising levels of atmospheric CO2, the world is cooling, and has been for 15 years. Deny all of this if you want to and stick to your global warming/ CO2 hypothesis if you want to, though I'm afraid you will continue sounding as ridiculous as you have here in your short posts.

This is because the IPCC has based its predictions solely on projections of CO2 in the atmosphere, a basic equation that says that increased levels of CO2 = increased global temperature rise. Other climate factors such as cosmic rays, which are known to have a direct impact on the earth's temperature, or the major oceanic cycles such as the PDO ( Pacific Decadal Oscillation) and AMO ( Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation ) have been largely ignored by the IPCC on the grounds that these are processes that are too little understood to have been included in their computer models. I could say a lot more, but I suggest that if you are in fact interested in what really drives our climate, then there are several books that will be very revealing for you. I particularly recommend Professor Fritz Vahrenholt's ' The Neglected Sun - Why the Sun Precludes Climate Catastrophe '.This is an excellent book, hugely well researched and well referenced throughout. In it you will see that in fact, CO2 is no more than a marginal player with regard to the earth's climate, and that the current cooling period we are witnessing, is in fact due to Sun cycles and Oceanic Cycles ( probably linked, but this is an area of science that is currently being pursued ) that have coalesced to take us into a cooling phase until about 2030-40, after which the climate is expected to warm again, though to nothing anywhere near the totally unscientific and misleading projections continually put out by the IPCC, who have their own agenda, yet are still able to manipulate and influence policy around the world, though this is beginning to change. The gradual climate trend is now however expected to be down for the next 500 years or so, or until the next imminent ice age hits us, something that is determined by a change in the tilt of the earth towards the sun, the so called, ' Milankovich Cycles', after the man who discovered them. There have been 21 ice ages during the last 2.6 million years, lasting on average 100,000 years. The interglacial periods, the latest of which we today enjoy, have lasted approximately 10,000 years. As we are now 12,000 years into this one, the next ice age is overdue, and will certainly happen at the start of the next Milankovich Cycle, though we are not sure exactly when this will be.  This is why I said I was rather disappointed that Chomsky seems to be behind the curve with regard to climate science, still sticking with the global warming doctrine despite the fact that it is rapidly being discredited.

I don't really view those two statistics you posted as being of significance. They may very well be; I just don't know enough, so it's helpful to get a lot of information. For instance, if in fact there has been no warming for the past 15 years, it would be a logical fallacy to accept that there will not be future warming. (not that I took that as your meaning) So, I need to see what reputable parties there are that say that there has been no warming for the past 15 years and what belief they are putting forth by stating that fact.

Its very simple cooling begins , the oceans cool and absorb CO2, then they warm and release it . There is absolutely no evidence that that CO2 has any say in the direction of temperature.

Dr.Nils Axel Morner - 35 years studying sea level rise) 5) The fact that the recent rise in temperature up until around 1998 is consistent with the expected NATURAL rise in temp of the current interglacial which is actually a repeat every 140,000 years in the present Holocene (Petite et al 1999) 6) The carbon dioxide being liberated in the burning of coal and gasoline etc is simply returning to where it started off...in the atmosphere.

That is only half the story. CO2 does in fact trap heat and raise temperature (albeit slightly) given the fact that it constitutes only 0.04% of the atmosphere. However the earth is homeostatic as every climate physicist knows so that as temperature on the surface increases so does evaporation and the formation of clouds. Clouds have the effect of reducing temperature by reflecting solar energy (which is the ONLY significant source of heat energy to our planet). But it doesn't stop there. THe decrease in solar activity as we have seen recently allows for more cosmic rays to come through our atmonsphere. Cosmic rays increased cloud cover further contributing again to increased reflection of solar radiation as well as trapping of heat energy radiating off the surface of the earth. So the interplay between is really between H2O, Cosmic and solar radiation. CO2 has very little say when it comes to the earth's temperature. You:""Human activity is increasing CO2 levels in our atmosphere dramatically"" If by dramatically you mean we add 3.5% CO2 to the atmosphere every year then yes. But that is a drop in the proverbial ocean since the CO2 forms only 0.04% of the atmosphere and out of that small percentage sea algae (not humans) produce the majority by respiration and elimination of excess CO2 used in photosynthesis. Furthermore there have ben times in the earths history when CO2 levels were as much as 30% of the atmosphere and the earth didn't overheat. In fact there is no real historical correlation between CO2 levels and temperature globally as you see here: Dr. Scotese et al 2002- http://www.biocab.org/Geological_Timescale.jpg Now look at for example around 435 Million years ago. Co2 levels were ten times higher than they are now at least yet the temperature change was less significant than present.

Finally, in attributing warming to man, they fail to point out that the warming has been small, and totally consistent with there being nothing to be alarmed about.  It is quite amazing to see the contortions the IPCC has to go through in order to keep the international climate agenda going.""

But neither was it established during the life of Galileo either so what is your point? He was also a philosopher himself just like his peers and if he is considered a scientist then so too would his peers be. The technology and methods of the time were different and less refined than today but the basic principle of observation and calculation held true then. Everyone at the time in that region including Galileo himself would have been Catholic so to say he was at war with the church based on science is erroneous. It was because he sought to persuade the church to change it's doctrine why he came into problems NOT his science. You:"" His ""peers"" were philosophers and intelligent church leaders who were affluent enough to spend time thinking on the subject, rather than plowing the fields."" Your so called knowledge of science ""history"" is in poverty my friend if you believe that Galileo was the only scientist ""ploughing the fields"" that is laughable. All scientists had access to the same technology as did Galileo. The majority of them reached the wrong conclusions (as have been the AGW advocates). That is the simple truth of the matter. The religious persecution of Galileo is well documented and has nothing to do with his scientific theory and everything to do with his disobedience to interfering with church doctrine. Church doctrine really has nothing to do with empirical science. Religion and science are not the different answers to the same question. They are different answers to DIFFERENT questions...except maybe Scientology :) You:""There is no rational comparison between this proto-science, and the modern scientific discipline."" Yes there is a rational comparison since both old and new ""methods"" are based on the same principle. How stuff works in the material world. You:""Just because people who had bowed their belief to church doctrine and interpretations of the bible, means nothing in comparison to the studied and intensely analyzed data by PhD's and fully qualified scientists today."" More arguments from authority. Why do you always seek to throw in the unscientific into a debate? With people like you men like Einstein would be nowhere today. Listen friend the scientists of Galileo's time were his equals and did not bow to religion because they held a similar view to the church. If this were so then the Copernican theory of geocentricism would not have caught on before it was rejected based on evidence at the time. It was rejected because scientists of the day observed and concluded differently to Copernicus. The same happened with Galileo. Not much in science is settled. That is why we have so many theories. We only have theories because of our limited perceptions of reality until better evidence for an alternative theory presents itself. You:""If a ""doctor"" of the time advocated for healthy eating and clean living to lower instances and severity of sicknesses rather than leeches, and was laughed at by his peers, that does not mean that a doctor who now claims that vaccines are bad science is de-facto correct."" Exactly my point friend. Consensus does not mean anything in science. The one making the claim needs to provide adequate evidence to back up his hypothesis (eg AGW) before his hypothesis can be taken seriously. It's called the burden of proof. Interestingly enough AGW advocates are still carrying that burden. You're getting it.",UCyRan6s1-LWKXBVY2VicHyg,1,Ught2A0EKEu0RXgCoAEC,FJUA4cm0Rck,2011-01-24 16:11:25

Global warming means that the annual global average temperature is increasing, which is clearly true.  It does not mean the end of winter, and it does not mean that there will be no more cold spells.  In fact, we are talking about only a few degrees of warming, but it makes a difference. And some scientists think that arctic warming might be contributing to some of the regional cold spells, through changing wind patterns.

The rate of increase is VERY debatable, whether it's increasing at all is a matter of where you get your information, and whether that information is obtained before the data is ""modified"" or ""corrected"". There are a thousand reasons why Venus is the way it is, proximity to the sun, less eccentric orbit, much less axial tilt and atmospheric density. I'm curious, where do you suppose all the Co2 came from - Venusians? What that doesn't tell us is why other planets in our solar system are showing similar increases in average global temperatures - Martians maybe? Besides, the effects of Co2 reach a point of saturation, in other words, the amount of Co2 and the coresponding increase in temprature is NOT linear. The amount of Co2 that man is responsible for is a tiny fraction of Co2 released into the atmosphere all over the planet. There's more than one way to solve a Rubik's Cube. - Please tell me I don't have to explain this to you!

Plants have been able to keep up with the growing amount of CO2 emissions by absorbing about 25% of the yearly output which means the amount of plant biomass has grown. The ocean has taken also 25% but 50% stays in the atmosphere and warms the planet. The ocean however will acidify (CO2 turns into carbonic acid in water) killing corals and will be saturated reducing the amount of CO2 that the ocean can take in.

Moreover, climate models can only reconstruct todays warming with the addition of fossil fuel emissions, while they show a slight cooling when they do not have fossil fuel emissions. Satellites measuring the spectrum of the radiation leaving the Earth show an increase in the absorption of the bands of the main greenhouse gases. Back in the 60s and 70s there was a combination of the fact that there are long scale ocean cycles that turn over large amounts of water (colder water from the bottom cools the air above it when it comes out to the surface) and that we were producing much more aerosols than greenhouse gases due to our inefficient engines back then.

The fact that every year since then has been hotter since it stopped is obvious data that contradicts the claim. Graphing the last decade that shows a downward trend is completely irrelevant to that claim. I honestly don't understand how you don't understand. It's like the people who claim that the arctic ice grew by 60%, but ignore the century long downward trend, not to mention that it grew 60% from the smallest level ever recorded, and even being 60% larger, it still at one of the lowest levels ever recorded.

The facts show NO increase for 17 years. Please check the data and stop arguing based on opinion and hearsay.

Not computer model predictions which have been failing consistently every year despite the IPCC claim that they are now 97% certain about climate change based on these same failed models. Propaganda doesn't work on me especially when it comes to science. This is where science and religious fanaticism differ. The former must be proven by empirical evidence and the latter will conform empirical evidence to validate it. You:""13 of the 14 hottest years on record have been in the 21st Century"" 1) Not true. The Medieval Warm Period had hotter years than these but the IPCC has conveniently revised it's first temperature reconstruction in later reports to make it seem cooler than it actually was. 2) Even if that were the case that is not how the scientific method is employed. Cherry picking years does not give an overall trend as temperature has been oscillating between hot and cool during this century: http://www.thegwpf.org/oceans-warming-global-surface-temperatures-stalling/ See how the temperature fluctuates. The overall trend is still statistically zero using the raw data...you know the stuff science uses to form theories. You:""we get a decade where the rate of increase is slowed "" No. It is 17 years and 7 months of complete statistical STALL of surface temperatures. NOT slowed but STALLED.

When released into the atmosphere it sinks immediately to ground level, where it remains. Chlorine molecules from CFC refrigerants cannot harm the ozone layer because they cannot get there. This fact was universally ignored by the scientifically illiterate media. Also ignored was the fact that the man-made sources of chlorine are minuscule compared with the natural level. The evaporation of sea water, the eruption of volcanoes all produce in a moment more than the total production of all man-made chlorine since the dawn of the industrial revolution.

He also talked about unions that are there to make the quality of worker&#39;s lives better. The conditions overseas are horrendous, with workers not being able to step outside of lines, spend too much time in the bathroom, or talk to a coworker, without fear of being written up. If they get written up too much they can get fined more than they make.

Perhaps some are paid by the penny for contentious comments. But the economic implosion by bankers and corporate cogs affects them as much as informed progressives of the same socio-economic class. Besides declining resources and environments -THIS IS A CLASS WAR. The rich just use the little tea bags for their own political purposes.
