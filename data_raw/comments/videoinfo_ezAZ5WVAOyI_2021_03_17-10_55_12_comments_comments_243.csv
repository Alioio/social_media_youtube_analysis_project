Problem for next century at worst. But if only half comes from land ice mass loss, where is the rest of it coming from? And that's the kicker, it's thermal expansion of the oceans. Does that mean oceans are getting warmer? Why yes, yes it does. And where is it going to have the biggest impact soonest? In the Arctic ocean of course, the one that's permanently covered with sea ice. In a decade or two, it won't be. Not too long from now, there will be open water at north pole. Did you by any chance know that snow and ice is very reflective and bright, while open water is anything but? Switching albedo from one extreme to another on an entire ocean is going to change things in northern climate and you are going to see that in your lifetime.

I you take a rock and move it from the land into the sea, you have just caused the sea to rise by the volume of that rock. The only force that counteracts this is mountain building. This happens by volcanic eruptions or uplift. Unless you live in a place where this is happening, sea level will always rise in relation to your position. If not for plate tectonics, all of the land would have been carried into the sea by erosion and the entire globe would be covered by water. The problem of measuring sea level rise is complicated by constant movement. All land is settling and sinking in addition to being ereoded off. No point on land is an objective fixed point to take a measurement. One way around this could be to measure using satellites, but the resolution of millimeters from space is unrealistic. We wouldn't have satellite data from 1900 to compare larger numbers. In addition to that, the surface of the ocean is not flat. Tides, winds, currents and temperature gradients make the surface of the ocean vary greatly and not entirely predictably. A proper average sea level is not that easy to determine. There is a massive equatorial bulge caused by the earth's rotation, but that can even vary. Earth's rotation is slowing down due to tidal drag of the moon. This caused the equatorial bulge to shrink and redistribute water north and south. Plate tectonics interferes with this by changing the earth's rotation slightly. If a mountain is pushed up near the equator, the earth slows more to conserve angular momentum. If a mountain is pushed up near the poles it has less effect. Some large earthquakes have been stated to have effected earth's rotational speed. Of course these changes are small, but only small changes are needed to cause some redistribution of water. You cant just drive a stick in the ground at the beach to figure this out. What is needed is a measurement of the total volume of land above sea level. Then you need to compensate the effects of mountain building vs erosion. Neither of these can be accurately measured to the resolution needed. Your original assumption that sea level is very difficult to measure to the needed accuracy was a correct one.",UCsHmZgYZRCzjJhNbjRhQeLw,1,UgxpsljONtn926VXBhZ4AaABAg,ezAZ5WVAOyI,2019-03-20 10:28:55

They got 3,146 responses to only these two questions‚Ä¶‚Äù<br />The first question asked, ‚ÄúWhen compared with pre-1800 levels, do you think that mean global temperatures have generally risen, fallen, or remained relatively constant?‚Äù The second asked, ‚ÄúDo you think that human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures?‚Äù<br />Ninety percent of the respondents said that the mean temp had risen, while 82 percent said that human activity was a significant factor. However, the term ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù was never defined. Furthermore, according to the Heartland Institute, most skeptic scientists would agree with the statistic if the term was defined.<br />The video explains that when formulating the 97 percent statistic, researchers used only the responses from ‚Äúclimate scientists.‚Äù However, only 5 percent of the respondents ‚Äì 79 people ‚Äì were climate scientists.<br /><br />So, out of 10,257 academics that the professor and graduate student identified as worthy survey participants, only 79 were in agreement with their final finding. When calculated, those 79 scientists ‚Äì now accepted as 97 percent - make up a meager 0.77 percent of academics. And, since only 97 percent of the 79 answered positively (which would be 76.63 people ‚Äì so we will round to 77), the percentage shrinks from 0.77 percent to 0.75 percent.<br /><br /><br /><br /><a href=""https://www.intellectualtakeout.org/article/do-97-scientists-really-believe-global-warming"">https://www.intellectualtakeout.org/article/do-97-scientists-really-believe-global-warming</a>",UCLiSDXuEdNcEIVW5oZl0P2g,0,UgySedUxCG6h1Uk0RSx4AaABAg,ezAZ5WVAOyI,2019-03-20 10:28:55

However, the role of CO2 and other greenhouse gasses as a feedback to Milankovitch forcings during glacial and interglacial transitions provides a compelling explanation for observed changes. Jeff Severinghaus, professor of geosciences at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, succinctly explains: The contribution of CO2 to the glacial-interglacial coolings and warmings amounts to about one-third of the full amplitude, about one-half if you include methane and nitrous oxide. So one should not claim that greenhouse gases are the major cause of the ice ages. No credible scientist has argued that position (even though Al Gore implied as much in his movie). The fundamental driver has long been thought, and continues to be thought, to be the distribution of sunshine over the Earth‚Äôs surface as it is modified by orbital variations ‚Ä¶ The greenhouse gases are best regarded as a biogeochemical feedback, initiated by the orbital variations, but then feeding back to amplify the warming once it is already underway. https://www.yaleclimateconnections.org/2007/10/common-climate-misconceptions-co2-as-a-feedback-and-forcing-in-the-climate-system/",UCYj_8umxrPS4TK8XNxkfdGA,1,UgyMTzfbqOJZzaKwYtJ4AaABAg,ezAZ5WVAOyI,2019-03-20 10:28:55

The concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are now higher than they have been for many thousands of years. Human activities (mainly greenhouse-gas emissions) are the dominant cause of the rapid warming since the middle 1900s (IPCC, 2013). If the upward trend in greenhouse-gas concentrations continues, the projected global climate change by the end of the twenty-first century will result in significant impacts on humans and other species. The tangible effects of climate change are already occurring. Addressing the challenges posed by climate change will require a combination of adaptation to the changes that are likely to occur and global reductions of CO2 emissions from anthropogenic sources. https://www.geosociety.org/gsa/positions/position10.aspx",UCYj_8umxrPS4TK8XNxkfdGA,1,UgyMTzfbqOJZzaKwYtJ4AaABAg,ezAZ5WVAOyI,2019-03-20 10:28:55

All these create too much noise, and when trying to find out what is the research outcome, then there is lot of confusion. To make it clear. Does industrial human activity add excessive CO2 in atmosphere? Answer 100% yes, while today this is the main factor. Does CO2 concentration affect overall temperature? Answer. Definitely yes, since there are still bands not fully saturated, and increasing CO2 concentration widens the spectrum absorbed within atmosphere. Another factor is that CO2 bands are absorbed lower in the atmosphere, which also helps overall energy not to escape to the space. However, main bands are already fully shadowed and thus it is no clear to me how severe is the overall effect. So there is a question on what shall be the actual effect? How severe. On this I do not see very clear outcome. If there is please let me know, and help me find the relevant study and report. As I understand so far nearly duplicating the CO2 concentration the temperature rise was little less than degree C. Supposing that this is fully due to CO2, then overduplicating CO2 by the end of century, reaching 1000 ppm, this shall add 1 degree C. Is this what are we talking about? Please your view and source on this please. And about sea level I think the official estimation is 0.2 up to 2m at the end of century. Are these correct figures? If not can you help me find the correct ones. By the way I do not claim to stop any action. On the contrary we need to act. Changing the CO2 concentration is indeed on human activity. This adds acidity, in the oceans, and even if not fully disastrous, when changes are quite rapid, the biosystem response is unknown. Definitely humanity needs to adapt balance necessity. There is no question on this. But when you see trailers with liberty status below water, then who is the dummy? Dummies are in both sides. Let us try to figure out what is the actual science research outcome, with which confidence level. I am really confused.
