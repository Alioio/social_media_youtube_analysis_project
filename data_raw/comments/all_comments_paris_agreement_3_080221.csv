The video I watched had what each country stated.   China said they would start to reduce emissions in 2030.   Each countries were all pretty lame. It was an agreement just to have an climate agreement.,0.0,0.0,,1WKoj-kodBw,

For one the Paris climate agreement has never met expectations, nearly nothing has been accomplished in the quarter century its been active. 
2. 1% of the century goals will be met in 2030 for climate change... a 1/3 of a century and we are 1% the way to where we need to be hmm
Money being wasted on this is pointless, if we put money into research in renewable energy like solar, wind power, creating carbon less oil on the ocean with algae, etc. no real impact will be made if we cannot get renewable energy to become cheaper than fossil fuels.

But, it doesn't necessarily mean that the US objectives won't be attained.  Also, my gut feeling is that Trump was setting the tone for the trade deal negotiations.  He knew it would look bad and I think that was part of the idea.  That even if it made him look bad, he would be unyielding and go through with it.  Some republicans  were very clear that they supported the agreements making the party not look so bad.  

Another factor is the presence of China that has stolen intellectual property from western countries, they collapsed the entire European solar panel industry because Europe did not unify against product dumping in their economies.  An can China be trusted with what they say they will do?  They didn't respect their trade deal with the US?

I'm not a climat sceptic, I do see the Paris agreements as a good first step to a unified effort.  I also know that it was done at the end of the Obama administration rather rapidly as was the Iranian nuclear deal.  So I don't condemn Trump's decision, I'm not ecstatic or angry and crying.

Not having to keeping your pledge makes it attractive to a lot of participants who (not improbably) may participate purely for political reasons. Say yes, and if there‚Äôs no consequence (to those you made promises to) when you didn‚Äôt do it is exactly the system politicians in poorly regulated and unjust countries take advantage of to look one thing but do the other.

Since there is no punitive aspect to the accord, the same thing happens as with any team that relies solely on the honor system. The good players make their sacrifice for the team and the ones who don‚Äôt do what they promised get away with the consequences someone else‚Äôs cost has provided. Plus, since in this case they didn‚Äôt make their country better, they‚Äôre with that part of the team who is screwing up the world AND their team-mate‚Äôs work in trying to save the world.

And since a form of this is already happening without an accord, what would make it wrong for one of the teamsters to say he‚Äôll go do what he was going to but independently?

Is this the only valid starting point, considering it‚Äôs in a stage where no solution of any kind is guaranteed? 

And in the presence of more than one starting point (as good as this one), isn‚Äôt it the right of each country to decide how they want to implement it and figure out ways how they can get to the same projected point while spending less?

1. It's bad for the economy, because we have to give 3 billion dollars, and to raise that money we will have to tax electricity, gas, and other non-renewable sources, which will increase cost of living/cost of doing business, and thus exacerbate poverty. Prices will go up. I truely wish Trump had actually done something significant for the environment, but it didn't happen.

""According to the National Economic Research Associates, if we met all of our commitments as part of the Paris climate agreement, it would cost the American economy $3 trillion and 6.5 million industrial sector jobs by 2040. We don‚Äôt need to cripple our economy to protect our environment.""

2. Absolutely right we call that a negative externality.

3. China is a very rich country now, they have all the infrastructure, if the 3 billion dollars was going to countries in Africa, or even India I'd be fine with it, but there is no good reason why we should give it to China. China is very well developed now for the most part. China is very much contributing to the problem. I'm not saying China should change first, China and the US should both be changing.

4. The Paris Accord is not even a step in the right direction, it's all the countries getting together and saying ""Yo, we should make a non-binding commitment where we pinky promise to try to reduce emissions, now give China and India 3 billion dollars pls"".

5. It's 7/10 registered voters not 7/10 Americans. Btw registered voters are less then 50% of the US population. I don't know how popular it would really be if Americans actually realized it would increase cost of living and we'd lose 3 billion dollars.

6. maybe maybe not, but economists (using the scientific method) have said it would be bad for the economy, so no on that part.

It would reduce temperatures by 0.3 farenheit in a century, while costing a fortune. So, what would happen at the end of the century? Well, the temperature would be reduced by about 0.3 farenheit, and would put many countries into debt and the US into even more debt. Sooner or later, these countries would not be able to afford the Paris Agreement, and then would drop out. In order to recover economic devastation, they would take faster ways (gas, powerplants, coal burning), and the tiny impacts the Paris Agreement would have made would be overturned by the new processes.

A better to approach climate change is deeper research. Before we should consider making changes, we should actually have knowledge about what we are going to do.

It opens the argument that the US isn't living up to its commitments. It could hurt potential trade deals if the US is perceived not to honor agreements, binding or not.
2) Governments have prevented developing nations from obtaining cheap energy by demanding they buy expensive worthless green energy products. CO2 is not a pollutant. It is an essential gas for life on this planet. A million years ago there was more CO2 than today. There is no science supporting CO2 causing more storms nor droughts. Your market example is complete nonsense.
3) China and India pollute 100 times more than the United States. We are cleaner, greener, and healthier than ever before by applying good environmental management, not by reducing our need for fossil fuels. The US is not the largest CO2 polluter, that's a lie. It also contradicts your first point. 
4) The Paris agreement would not have changed the CO2 levels. It would punish the United States for being economically successful using energy efficiently. The Paris agreement was just a socialist contract for a one world globalist model. 
5) Withdrawing from the Paris agreement has nothing to do with being unpopular, it is economically unrealistic. You do not hurt your nation by limiting how it uses energy. This contradicts your second point.
6) The leftist talking point of blaming America First has been a socialist argument to undermine our capitalist economy. We didn't piss off anyone. You deliberately prevent developing nations from obtaining affordable energy. Again, you contradict all your points by saying that the United States has to live up to its responsibilities. We're not responsible for other governments, and neither are they responsible for us. The vast majority of American people agree with President Trump's decision to get out of this corrupt socialist agreement. Your assumptions that most Americans agree with the Paris agreement is woefully wrong and pathetically ignorant.


You obviously haven't been keeping up with current events. President Trump is popular with the majority of Americans and is on his way to a second term as President of the United States. We predict a landslide election of epic proportions. The President's policies on the environment, the economy, jobs and employment, and national security, are inline with a sustainable successful capitalist model. Unlike the socialist model you are proposing, which is designed for failure, is unsustainable and will cause global conflicts. You have no facts, no data to support your arguments, you offer contradictory hypotenuses and smug elitism. See you in November, 2020.",2.0,0.0,,1WKoj-kodBw,

Lope,"Here in California where our dumb ass politicians have decided to implement the UN's policies making them law and not just non binding targets entire industries have been chased out of the state because they can't meet the ridiculous requirements set by agencies like CARB (California Air Resources Board). They have all but killed the trucking industry in this state. Other states are talking about adopting CARB's regulations like New York and as more states follow suit their economies are going to suffer dearly. Wait until the regulators apply these standards to farming equipment. Not only will there be no way to get food to market there won't be any food to take to market.


The best reason to pull out of any accords pertaining to climate change is we shouldn't be implementing policies detrimental to our economy and our standard of living based on some computer models designed by antropogenic bobble heads and green crusaders. By the way CO2 is not a pollutant. It is a life gas essential for all life on this planet as well as bubbles in your beer.


If the green crusaders wanted something meaningful to focus their energies on why don't they focus on that gaping nuclear disaster in Japan that is still 15 years away from being contained. The damage it has caused is monumental and real but you don't hear anything about that on the news. Do you know if that Tuna fish you are eating was caught in the Atlantic or Pacific oceans? Is there any radioactivity in that can of tuna you are opening and about to feed your children? Who knows? No one, because we are all focusing on Trump, Russia and global warming instead of what really matters.

They have a population of 2-3 _billion_ ! That's way more than Europe and the US combined, so by the time China and India's populations have reached the same standards of living as we have and they switch to ""green energy"", they would emitted way more CO2 than we do and have now. So I find this to be BS. It's not even just burning of coal and oil.

For 1, the markets have done quite well for the entirety of his presidency( Ignoring the recent pitfall). 2. He has fixed the corporate tax code quite well this way. Dropping the tax down to 22% was a brilliant idea, Now companies such as Apple will not be able to keep money abroad. I don't agree with his newer income tax overhaul though. 

Regardless, Let's go through your argument,
1. Yes, you pay money, why? To build the technology. It is not actually fucking money it is Investment. Do you know how much investment China got after the US left? $220 Billion dollars from the EU which was supposed to go to the US so they could advance the technology. You say they are ignoring the goals, but China (largest emitter of greenhouse gasses), which was one of the main reasons for leaving has cut emissions and invested $300 Billion into solar and renewable energy. India (3rd largest emitter) invested $40 Billion + a $150 billion world bank loan
2. The US economy is extremely dependant on the world economy. IF the US shuts itself in, it also looses most of its riches. Look at the fortune 500. 65% of them are US businesses, You think the US shutting itself in will make them wanna stay more. Most of their businesses are abroad. The future of the US economy is similar the UK economy, becoming stagnant after some time. 
3. What do you mean? China and the one belt one road plan, it basically owns Africa and it produces the majority of all goods around the world. The US is dependant on China and China is dependant on the US. But China is less dependant on the US compared to the other way around.

1. Yes, it was non-binding FOR ALL COUNTRIES but that was to let all countries join. More than 70% of all countries will be affected so there was a stake in it. Third world countries got it easier, yes, but logically shouldn't they? the US yearly contributes to 18% of all climate pollution but only has 4% of the population + it has the maximum combined pollution historically, however, it has significantly grown from it. China and India, as stated by trump, have it easier but that is because they haven't done much damage yet so why should they pay for the first world countries mistakes. that being said they also have a rigid calendar of getting their shit together in 2025, China pushed this up to 2020 after the pull-out. 
2. Not really, china's panels are cheap enough to get into the US they are just not accessible to more people. China also owns the entire international demand as seen by the France-china and UK-china relations. Essentially who will buy the US good if the Chinese and provide the same good a fraction of the price. (Look at the sea solar farms in china and the largest solar farm in the world in India) 
3. I mean the entire agreement is non-binding, even for the US. You set your own targets and you have to meet them on your own. No country or external power will monitor. Also yes, China will soon become the dominant economy in the world that is just a fact. it is equally dominant now as it was with Obama. No difference really. Currently, China's objective is NOT the US so they don't mind the increase in tariffs, they are trying to conquer India atm.

5. Pretty sure you are wrong there, if you are saying the end of Obama's term vs trump present, It would be 60%(when Obama left office) and 30%(Trump currently)

a)  If its non binding then you damage the US for no real benefit because other countries don't follow (assuming you even get a benefit at all)
b)  Not ending a bad policy just because it will outlast your term is stupidity.
c)  Ending one badly made policy does not define what the country invest in.
d) Effects of carbon tax to an economies GDP takes time to see.   US is a good example of this.  After the US implemented bad economic policies in other areas, it took many decade for the mass exodus of businesses to take place.  That is still a problem today.  The US has not solved it regulatory problems that is causing this.  The tax bill helped but there is still much more work to do.
e)  Your ignoring the fact that the Paris agreement requires the US to pay a ton of money to other countries.  Money that would be better spent on technology development.   We could not waste the money on the Paris agreement and make the first economical solar power system.  We could also develop the first commercial molten salt reactor.

2)
a)  Your ignoring the fact that it is normal for the earth to go up to 600 ppm of CO2 on its own.  How did the earth handle these levels of CO2 in the many past times it occurred?
b)  Your ignoring the fact there is no proof that humans are causing the CO2 levels to rise.
c)  Your ignoring the fact that it has already been proven that the Earth was going to be heating up even without humans because we are coming out of the little ice age.
d) You have no proof at all that a weather condition is being caused by humans.   You can't expect someone to pay for damages when there is no proof they even caused damages.
e)  Your ignoring the fact that the economy is not a free market in that since because many green technologies get such massive subsidies per kwh that it far exceeds any subsidies the fossil fuel market obtains.

3)
a)  Your ignoring the fact that your essentially raising US emissions by sending businesses to China and India which has less strict laws.  If your emission reduction laws raise emissions in certain industries and hurts people by pushing companies overseas.  You hurt a country for no reason.

4)  
a)  That is not how you come together to do something.  That is just playing politics.  If you wanted to do something then you would make the technologies you want to use more economical.
b)  Your ignoring the real reason behind the Paris agreement.  To funnel money to people.

5)
a) Not getting into popularity for the obvious problem with the nature of that topic

6)  
a)  I am surprised you would stoop your channel to an obvious lie and political pot shot.  Especially since your a science channel.   You really destroyed your credibility with that one.  Instead of the more obvious answer of, he believes his own reasons that the agreement is bad for the economy and is pointless.  That it would provide no benefit and actually detract from US investment(via sending money to a political organization).  Remember that he has decades of experience in business and has seen what goes on in politics from the business side.


Now this this leads to real solutions that would actually help the world.   Forget these agreements and focus on technology development so that Nuclear and Solar can surpass fossil fuels without any subsidizes.  The irony about the entire global warming debate is that it is pointless.   There are plenty of other reasons to swap to other energy technologies that have nothing to do with the environment.   Being able to reduce the cost of electricity below what fossil fuels can achieve would do wonders to bringing people out of poverty.  That would also reduce poverty related crimes since there is less poverty.  Nuclear power is the best candidate for this.  We also need nuclear power technology developed for ships at sea and spacecraft.   Solar can also eventually achieve this.  Solar also has the benefit of decentralized power systems which has many benefits of its own.   It is more resistant to damage.  It would end monopolies in the energy industry to a large extent which cause electricity to be much more expensive.  The reasons go on from there.",0.0,0.0,,1WKoj-kodBw,

St. Petersburg, Fl. is  currently considering making solar power installations mandatory on all new housing construction. If you wanted to create a backlash against ""Green"" energy I really can't  think of any better way to do it. You have a city department dedicated to achieving ""Green"" status by 2027 which has decided that the best way to do that is to force every new or majorly renovated home to install solar panels.

This is the exact kind of thing that all the anti-environmentalists stirred up their base by predicting and that we assured them wouldn't  happen. At least not until solar was more long-term cost efficient than traditional utility providers.

Proposals like the one in St. Petersburg almost seem designed to prove the opposition's fears about green energy mandates and unreasonable or unsupportable costs correct.

People need to take a step back and look at things from the opposition's point of view. In our hurry and zeal to make a change we need to be sure we don't fall into the trap of doing exactly what they've predicted simply because it seems expedient.

I don't believe that CO2 is contributing to global warming to the extent that many people do, but I still enjoyed this video, because with the whole climate change debate that is going on today, it seems like nobody is bothering to be respectful to those who hold opposing views. Again, I don't believe that climate change is a very big problem like many people, but that doesn't mean I'm justified in yelling my point to them and trying to force them to my point of view, and it doesn't make anybody else justified to dismiss me as a crazy climate change denier. This doesn't just apply to climate change debate: it's something that's impossible to not see in any political debate.
The reason why I enjoyed this video, even if I didn't agree with it, is because you clearly and coolly stated your stance on the issue and didn't force it down my throat. Even if we can't come to an agreement of climate change, I hope that everyone reading this can agree with me that in any debate, it is important to remember to be respectful and not dismiss the opposition with name-calling and shouting.

The Paris Climate Agreement is the epitome of virtue signaling. Virtue signaling at the state level, globally. Another warped justification to further damage the West for the sake of control and power. Control over North American and European citizens, who, despite an overall worsening situation for civil rights in the past half a century, remain the most free in the world and the greatest enemies of political and corporate corruption. This is the purpose of all the policies what result foremost in lowering the civil rights and quality of life for the average westerner. The outsourcing, the excessive legal immigration and unchecked illegal immigration, the socialist policies supposedly aiding the lower class at the cost of the middle class, the progressive policies supposedly assimilating immigrants and for the self-righteous cause of humanitarianism at the cost of the natives, middle and lower class... the western middle class is the driving force of animal and environmental protection. Take them out of the picture and who is left to upkeep all preserves in Africa and elsewhere? Who is left to push corrupt governments to fight poaching, polluters and animal abuse in general? The Chinese? They're the greatest force of environmental destruction and animal abuse. They fund most of the poaching through demand of animal parts, be it for bogus traditional Chinese medicine or ivory to carve Buddha statuettes. The Russians aren't nearly as bad, but they're also relatively backward, they're not gonna take up the cause. Their current regime favors drilling for oil in the Arctic rather than preserving it or the Siberian permafrost containing enough methane to do us in completely. India? Brazil? Tsc... We have a lot to improve upon, but we remain the world's best intended folk, collectively. And we're the most capable of making a change, too. Not simply through means, but through ability. It's a cultural circumstance. We can help the entire world along, but we certainly don't do it by damaging ourselves at the behest of the corrupt.

Suppose the plans relating to the PCA could actually make a considerably positive impact on the world's atmosphere. This hinges on the premise that the politicians and corporate executives pushing for it are trustworthy people. Do any of you truly think they are? Do you really trust the governments and corporations they run? These folk are all in the same country club, the same cartel, that have been collectively draining their own countries for their self gain for a long, long time. The opposition you'll see between parties that take turns ruling is pure theatrics. Why do you think there's never more than 2 or 3 parties that get to govern in any given country? The system is meant to give you the illusion of choice. If the opposition was real, you'd have actual choice, even if both/all sides are corrupt. They're not about to leave that up to chance. We're only human, so it's not gonna be a clich√© movie plot of perfectly evil schemes. There will be deviation and disagreement, but, as a whole, there is most certainly a collaboration for international corruption among these individuals. Organizations like the UN and the IMF exist for that very reason. The ultimate goal being total control. Money plays into that completely. Money is power. Power is control. In the most pessimistic future possible, the ruling class wouldn't need money to rule, they would own you, simply. They would own everything. Money would be moot. The goal is control, money and powers are the means.

3:34 That's one of the main reasons of all the outsourcing, chiefly to China. Which, in turn, is one of the main reasons they've fast become the world's greatest polluters. You're quite right! That's a rotten deal. Outsourcing for cheaper products (read: cheaper operating costs, greater profit) at the cost of countless jobs (ultimately, resulting in a reduced average purchasing power to pay for those cheaper products), greatly furthering environmental destruction by folk with much lower ecological standards to abide by (if any), furthering slavery (in all but name) and, overall, furthering and rewarding highly corrupt and authoritarian regimes (the Communist Chinese government enforcing a one-party system, in particular, being bent on expansion of territory, power and wealth by any means) who will only bring about more destruction and suffering as they strengthen.

The one thing that is dubious is the effectiveness of carbon taxes. I'll look into the one in Canada, but just because it worked there does not mean it will work everywhere else, and it certainly does not work by causing emitters to bare the tax burden. You have to keep in mind that a carbon tax by its very nature is regressive because the costs of the tax will be passed on by corporations to the consumer. You also have to realize that energy production is a basic element of the infrastructure of the economy, and also where most emissions occur, so literally the entire capital structure of the economy is affected by the carbon tax. Theoretically this says that the costs will be borne nearly in proportion to energy usage across the economy.

Because wages and salaries will not go up immediately to account for the higher prices of mostly every product, in the very short run, consumption of products that require emissions should go down. For the markets to clear properly, the supply will also have to drop (because the reduced demand will create a surplus at the current price). The price itself cannot just drop to cause clearing, because it is in response to the higher input costs deep in the capital structure. Thus, emissions should drop in the short run as supply decreases. This is the hoped for outcome. In the long run, wages and salaries are expected to increase as ""aggregate"" markets begin to clear, but it is hoped that by this time energy production is now using ""green"" technologies. Read below to see why this is hoped for or expected and why in the real world it won't work.

Energy production would also now have an incentive to invest in technologies that are not subject to the tax (so clean emissions). This is of course signaled by the decreased energy usage which should reduce their profits. They want to make the same amount of money as before. Here is where real world problems start to get in the way of the expected outcomes from economic theory working! First off, energy production companies enjoy government granted, geographical monopolies. They don't have any competition that will give any prime/first mover benefit to quickly developing cleaner production processes. But as mentioned above, they should still work on it. This is where problem 2 comes in. Large energy producers don't actually make any money off selling power right now anyway. As an example, in California, the Public Utilities Commission caps profits on assets held by these companies. So how do the companies make money? They simply build assets that are unnecessary for the current demand and raise their rates (so they do, I guess, sort of make money selling power, but only because of this shady shit).

Even if this was fixed, which it won't be (plenty of people get rich off of it), we have to deal with problem 3, which is the huge one that doesn't have a (viable) technical solution yet. That is the problem of distribution of power and this is very much an infrastructural problem. Of course we all know the sun doesn't shine at night, so how are solar producers going to produce energy to distribute at that time? The common solution proposed is to store excess production in batteries, and until recently batteries that could be used to do this didn't exist. The problem now is that batteries have a short lifetime and the chemicals used in them are considered dangerous, hazardous waste. The problem that producing the batteries requires emissions is only a short run problem of course, because eventually the feedback loop that allows them to be produced by the clean energy power is established. But human beings still haven't solved the big problem of what to do with hazardous waste (or any waste for that matter). Now we end up substituting one form of pollution (greenhouse emissions) for another (disposal of batteries). This happens at such a massive scale that it isn't really clear if one is better than another.

So this is all to say that those who are responsible for emissions don't really have to bare any costs because they just pass them along, they are well connected enough already in the US that they will not see significant losses when markets react to those costs, and even if all the economic problems are solved and the markets are allowed to clear and lead to clean energy production, we still don't know if the outcome (lots of hazardous batteries that need to be trashed) is better than our current greenhouse gas emissions. People are jumping on the bandwagon to support the gigafactories of Elon Musk without understanding that there are huge challenges to getting those working on the energy grid (but it is doable with considerable waste in transmission losses -- though those losses only occur when stored energy is powering the grid), and that they will lead to hazardous waste that if not handled properly will lead to a bunch of toxic chemicals getting into their water supplies (and governments in the US don't seem to care too much about problems like that anymore).",0.0,0.0,,1WKoj-kodBw,

Solar panels are a toxic nightmare when they are worn out, and there will be MOUNTAINS of them in 20 years.

CO2 IS NOT A POLLUTANT.  CO2 concentrations are at saturation levels at absorbing infrared.  Adding more will only absorb a tiny fraction more.

Storms are not more intense, droughts not more common.  All these predictions of the last 30 years have simply not materialized.

¬†let me put things into perspective:  if temperatures go over a certain point in the next hundred years, which they definitely are, sea level will increase to the point that most of the coastal cities will be flooded. 

New York, New Orleans, Los Angeles, Singapore, most of Holland...say goodbye to those, if we don't do something to stabilize temperatures, in 2117 you'll need a boat to visit there.

But what's that to 100 trillion that will most likely go to pointless wars, right? money's more important! 

and another think: when the climate changes, a lot of the dry regions will become even drier. That means places like the middle east and north Africa will become increasingly inhospitable. 

That means tens of millions of people will be displaced, and where do you think they will go? It'll make the current refugee crisis look like a joke in comparison, and that'll really put a spike in the whole ''but the west has to pay for it'' narative, won't it? yes, dear, the west will have to pay a lot, especially if we don't stabilize temperatures, sweat-hearths.

a‚Ä¢Co2 followed temperatures for many years in the past
b‚Ä¢we put Co2 into the atmosphere: (100 parts per million) increasing it from 300 to 400

assumptions:
Temperatures follow co2 and not the other way around

Theory:
according to observation a‚Ä¢ temperatures must go up and meet the theory


Proposed Mechanism for this to happen:

Co2 traps heat ergo more co2 more heat will be trapped


Problems with the mechanism:

CO2 only absorbs 2.7, 4.3 and 15 um from  long wave radiation (IR spectroscopy)
half molecules are reflected back before entering  - 1/2 of what enters is kept in. The first 20 part per million Co2 are enough to filter almost all the radiation from that specific wavelengths. 
once we filter all 2.7, 4.3 and 15 um it doesn‚Äôt matter how much more co2 we put in.
Same rules applies for escaping radiation. also Co2 is only 4% of overall greenhouse gas

Therefor i do not see how this mechanism can be used to keep rising the temperatures

And neither should you.

Now I don‚Äôt know how Co2 effects other parts of the environment . for example the oceans 
I know it is extremely beneficial for the plants. But that is a completely different discussion.

Especially if countries like the USA who are having economic touble, compared to their past economy, must continue to give money to developing countries to continue to pollute more. All that out of fairness to countries like China??
You said it yourself, China & India are current major polluters and also you said cheap products are cheap as long as the producers are allowed to pollute so, why encourage the continued pollution by a non-binding agreement with current unilateral restrictions on some but not China or India?
 You say you are unable to figure out why the USA would do such a thing if not just for Trump to pander to his base but, you actually answered your own question though, by saying things are unfair. 
The world is inherently unfair as long as there are limited resources upon an increasing population within a closed environment i.e.-the Earth. Someone is always going to get the dirtier end of the stick no matter how fair & nice people play for limited resources. China and India have had thousands of years as a civilization within their man made borders and unique cultures to figure their needs out in accordance to a changing world. Why punish one of the newest cultures and countries as the USA for figuring things out first about how to fulfill their citizen's needs according to the way the world changes? China has been polluting with their exports longer than the USA has been a country. The largest national economy in the world before the USA took the lead was not the British or even any European country at all... It was China and had been China for centuries. Because China always chooses politco-economic gain over the wellbeing of its individual citizens. 
It took the USA as nation less time from its formation to its institutution of its EPA, FDA & USDA as well other environmental, work and industry safety orgs than China could go in roughly 2 Emporers lifetimes. India & China has had many hundreds of years to do something for their average citizens and all the movement to do so in the USA began while China still had Emporers! So, it would appear as if Trump withdrew from a non-binding agreement on climate for at least several resons. 
1. biggest current polluters don't have to cut anything for a long time to gain the system with just a promise & a wink.
2. the current biggest polluters are countries that have a long standing habit of not caring about their pollution and citizens when faced with a dent in their economy so, why trust them to stop at some agreed point in the future when they aren't bound to when other countries have to? on top of that, the USA is to pay countries like India development money in the meantime 
3. even you say if the agreement worked between countries, it would not meet its projected climate goals. Thus, any USA future focus on such agreement is more to pander to Trumps opposite base with a misleading substance. (Anyway, of course Trump panders to his base! So does every other elected official, movie star, street corner musician, YouTube click-bait content producer and, even you!) Why would Trump pander to his opposite base when to do that, he would be losing the base that is the only one actually grounded in how living life in the real world works as opposed to a base where the world is nothing more than a concept, a construct to be deconstructed just because it appears to be unfair for everyone.
4. again, life.. for the individual or a group, no matter wether human or a colony of ants, is inherently unfair in as much as you only get any where near as much out of it as you put into it and.... even that is if you have a lot of chance luck of things like the country/family of birth, societal peace, education opportunity & job security. Human life, society and political promises are bound by the same natural laws & forces that shape the whole universe. Not every country can, or has at some point, even attempted increasing the odds of those aforementioned bits of opportunistic luck for its average citizens. To better help wrap your head around  that, some countries can't continue to provide the same opportunites to its citizens if participating in a unilaterally beneficial agreement where they must also dole out their citizen's tax money on a world market that is doing its best to devalue it! All life , in a physical sense and in accordance to evolution and universal laws, actually is like a shittier, scarier version of the Highlander movie. lt began with just one and, after much battle of the wills, will end with one. Every country and person wants to be that ""one"" even if it means having to strategically shame others into capitulation over the same things ones self does when nobody's looking. Life, in general and in specific to humans , is genetically programmed to try to ride the lightning to the very end in relative comfort compared to its genetic Jones neighbors/competitors. If one thinks otherwise, grab a tissue,  dry your eyes, grow up, put on Queen's ""It's A Kind of Magic"" album and get in the game! what's your alternative...A evil destroying flood and Arc log flume ride? Praying to sneak past Saint Peter? 72 virgins but a missing self-bombed off sexy bit? And will meditation in a cave or       secluded monastery really help the world outside ones own head if you can't even escape politics, youtube talk at work nor even keep governments out of the private pics of your junk that you think is hidden safe on your partner's cell phone?
Even you must agree that the USA has evened the playing field for the average individual and the poor more than any other country in history so, why punish it more than any other if not for a misguided and unwarranted sense of guilt from within and envy from outside?
 It is plain to see this non-binding agreement is cheered by those countries whose economies stand to grow the most and coffers be filled with the money of citizens from countries who pay them to play fair on a non-binding promise with no penalties to actually make good on it all. 
It is the reason and duty of every honorable group or country to see that its populace comes first. Why is it so hard to understand that?
So, if all you can do is say the only conclusion you can think of is that Trump must just be pandering to his base then, in my opinion, you need to stick to tier 3 science videos on youtube and stay out of socio-political commentary on scientific issues.

1. Each country could set their own resolutions
2. None of the resolutions were reinforced

Firstly, the fact that you could set your own resolutions meant that it would be like meeting up with a bunch of overweight friends and resolving to lose some weight. But you can set your own target and no one can challenge it so you say ""I'm gonna lose 1 kg over 6 months,"" and everyone says ""good on you,"" even though that's bad and they need to lose more.

Secondly, because it's not reinforced, if your friend doesn't lose any weight after 6 months then no one say ""hey, that was bad, what the hell.""

So here's the technicalities behind the agreement.

If the carbon emission cuts for Obama's Clean Power Plan are met for an entire century (instead of just 14 years like the accord describes) the temperature of the year 2100 would decrease by about 0.023 degrees according to the model constructed by the UN. If everything that Obama promised to do was met, then the combined decrease of temperature in the year 2100 would be about 0.057 degrees. Even if this was done, the rise in temperature would be postponed by about 8 months.

If the whole agreement was met and sustained for a century instead of 14 years, the 2100 temperature would be reduced by 0.3 degrees.These reductions would cost between 1 - 2 trillion dollars per year so about 100 trillion dollars minimum over one century for a difference in temperature of 0.3 degrees. The dumb part was that these promises were done by Obama during the last days of his presidency so he made these outrages resolutions and knew that his predecessor would have to eat it.

To top it off, it would also cut production to the following:
Paper - 12%
Cement - 32%
Iron/Steel - 38%
Coal - 86%

Having said all this, leave Trump alone about the agreement. He was well within the right to leave such a waste-of-time agreement.

So overall, the agreement was stupid and pointless. If any of these countries had competent leaders around at the time of the agreement, then they would actually try to find a decent solution and stop coming together to slap each other on the back and pretend they were actually doing something for the world.

Solution to global warming for the idiot leaders still in a redundant agreement:

Implement nuclear power plants for large population areas while small populations can be powered with hydro and wind power. Solar power is a maybe because its probably the worst of the clean energies.

Nuclear power is safe, cheap, highly reliable and extremely clean. In fact, nuclear power is responsible for about 90% of the reduction of carbon emissions since 1990 to 2012, while solar power is responsible for about 0.5% across the same time frame.

- On point one: 
If we don't have to follow the Paris agreement, why be in the agreement? Its just more bureaucracy for the government?

Just because the GDP was in step with the rest of Canada, that does not account for the taxes that are handed off to the middle class such as gas taxes and passed on expenses from the power companies etc. Granted they do give a tax credit to the families, but it is only about 100 dollars a year per family... what about small businesses that rely on heavy machinery and energy?

-On Point 2:
You make a great point with your river analogy, but I dont think you give the free markets enough credit. I am all for green innovation, but to suggest that we should have a government limit the means of production in one area in order to make it 'fair' for another area is not the same as throwing trash in a river (especially since we have entire free market companies that are designed to manage waste). 

Many companies and investors in America are investing (without a carbon tax) in green technology today. Obviously Tesla is the most popular, but what about every other car manufacture (Even before CAFE they were trending to be more fuel efficient with many hybrid options)? Even Shell Oil VOLUNTARILY invest 1 Billion a year to renewable energy R&D. The market responds to what people want, and as you stated in a later point, a vast majority of people want to stay in the Climate agreement, which you can then conclude that a vast majority want more green options.

-On point 3: 
You are absolutely correct about the fact that China and India need to get through their Industrial revolution, but we need to get through our post-industrial-modern (made this up) era... and I believe we are in that transition. I believe we are in a similar transition to our new era as we were in the industrious 1800s. Just as they built the first factories, and manufacturing lines, we are building our first neuro-nets, AI, fidget spinners, and green technologies. The fossil fuel industry is enabling the green industry to bloom.

-On Point 4:
I refer back to my retort to point 2 in that, if there are so many people that support this deal, why not just leave it to the markets?

-On point 5/6:
Yes, Trump most likely did do this to piss off his opponent you had stated that the climate agreements don't require us to follow  the targets, couldn't you say that this was just part of a way for the Obama administration to piss off the opposition?

-Conclusion:
I consider myself a conservative, but I cannot stand people on the right bashing green energy just as much as I cannot stand people bashing the fossil fuel industry. We should celebrate research, development, and success in whatever industry it might be because in the end, It is not the energy sectors that drive our societies, it is our innovations.",0.0,0.0,,1WKoj-kodBw,

I'm not going to waste my time rebutting each of your points, however easy and satisfying that would be. I am commenting because I have a specific grievance with that part where you mention my province's carbon tax to illustrate that reducing emissions by taxing them doesn't hurt the economy.

You, the wiki page that you quote, and the accompanying World Bank article, seem to suggest that because BC's GDP growth outperformed the parts of Canada that did not have the carbon tax, that this is evidence that the tax (the cause of the reduction) didn't harm the economy. It is misleading because correlation does not equal causation. In order for that argument to work, all other factors contributing to GDP growth need to remain the same, which of course, is impossible considering all the variables. It is also misleading because *** the Provincial Liberal Government scaled back tax rates for individuals and corporations to make the tax ""revenue neutral."" That is, for every dollar that taxed carbon, a dollar worth of tax breaks was given to individuals and corporations.*** It's really hard to argue your point when you start introducing variables such as this. As often appears to be the case worldwide, it was largely the reduction in personal and corporate taxes that fueled the growth that made BC's economy appear strong. This, and the amazing fact that people from all over the world will pay a million dollars to own the human equivalent of a rat cage in Vancouver. I would strongly agree that this WAS a good model for its time, but it is no longer possible to hide the negative economic impacts of the carbon tax. The tax is no longer revenue neutral, nor is it expected to be at any point in the future. The carbon tax, and all the cost associated with it are expected to rise, while income and corporate tax breaks appear to be comparatively stagnant (excluding ones that are being promised by people seeking government power). What economic growth there has been in this province, has nearly nothing to do with reducing emissions. I repeat: what economic growth there has been in this province, has nearly nothing to do with reducing emissions. 

In summary, stop using your ignorance of my province's tax laws and economy in your lame, thinly-veiled anti-Trump videos. It absolutely infuriates me that up to half a million people will listen to what you have erroneously said about my province's carbon tax and add it to their fake news repertoire to push their ideological BS!!!

We don't need a non-binding contract that takes an annual cut to be in a club that we don't need to be a part of.

If the companies in the U.S. want to induce more cleaner and sustainable energies, they don't need to force any other company to do so until they've done it themselves, without the subsidies that the government gives for such things.  They could make a newer and better alternative to solve the problems of renewable energy and allow progression to take its natural course.

This Paris Climate Agreement can be looked at for guidelines, but it makes no substantial changes either way, which is why Nicaragua didn't even bother looking into it, since they may already be looking for better alternatives on their side.

Any data that points to the contrary is likely due to higher efficiency building construction mandates, and new vehicles on the roadways that are also much more efficient in the consumption of fossil fuels.  By no means is this a ""green"" city however, because there are blocks of houses that were built in the 90's that are demolished every day here.  Developers are replacing them with high density condominiums, whose building materials are sourced through countries like China, and I will argue that Vancouver itself is contributing much more CO2 into the atmosphere through proxy due to this reason.

The first reason, you did not provide any valid counter argument, based on economic report data, respecting the Paris accord will cost trillions of Dollars and millions of Jobs in Steel, cement and coal and oil industries. These industries will be just moved to other countries, because the need will still be there. The price of Electricity will rise by 20/30% on US consumers.  That is beside the green fund, where US is required to fund third world countries with Billions of dollars every year.  You failed to mention all that. 
Saying that it is non binding, means it is useless. so, why everybody is crying that he left it !! 
Second reason, you fail again... Yes, let's make the market free. In fact US has a much stricter environmental regulation for industries than most other world countries. So moving them to China and 3rd world countries, will be much worse for the planet. It will be like rewarding the countries less respecting the environment 

The third reason, you refer to ""historic"" data, but not to today's data. Today India and China are more pollutants to the climate much more than USA. This seems to me like a communist approach of redistributing USA wealth to other countries. Why would the US voluntarily accept this which is a kind of punishment for its previous economic success !!

The fourth reason,  you have hidden the fact that the agreement does not even come ANY CLOSE to achieving this target, this is complete dishonesty from you. The agreement will have temperature rise reduction of around 0.02 degrees according to UN data (compared to 2 degrees required)  And the price is Trillions of Dollars and Millions of lost jobs and 20 to 30% increase in Electricity Bill, just to make YOU feel good !! without any tangible results !!  All you present here is just wishful thinking from your side. 

I am undecided on this topic, I have watched the argument of the Trump supporters, and I was waiting for some serious counter arguments or facts from the liberals, but all I get is feelings, and sarcasm, comedy,  shaming and throwing guilt and anxiety (like: He killed the planet, we all gonna die) , but no serious counter arguments to Trump fans specific points...

It's a non-binding commitment to emission goals that has built into it the requirement for the US to shell out lots of money that have to be distributed in a way that has yet to be determined because there are no specifics in the actual agreement.
So in order for the climate agreement to go forward, congress would have to sign off on a budget where the purpose and end distribution of a large chunk is not even known yet. Good luck getting that through.

Back in 2008/09, when the province first introduced the carbon tax, the B.C. government promised revenue neutrality. And initially it was. To offset the new revenue, the government introduced new cuts to personal and business tax rates and a new tax credit for low-income earners. The value of these new tax reductions was enough to offset all the new revenue generated from the carbon tax.
However, just five years later, as the carbon-tax revenue increased, the government no longer provided new tax cuts that sufficiently offset the carbon tax‚Äôs revenue. In other words, B.C.‚Äôs carbon tax ceased being revenue neutral in 2013/14. Once the pre-existing tax reductions are properly removed from the government‚Äôs revenue-neutral calculation, B.C. taxpayers endured a net tax increase of $226 million in 2013/14 and $151 million in 2014/15. Those numbers are based on historical data.
According to data from the government‚Äôs own projections, *the carbon tax will result in a cumulative $865 million tax increase on British Columbians between 2013/14 and 2018/19. So much for revenue neutrality.*

Their reasoning is that it's better that the US is officially not part of the Paris Agreement (and thus an outsider to everyone else) than being a misbehaving and truculent member of it and thus de-motivating everyone else who's in it (which runs kinda counter to Derek's argument in point 1). Better that the US is sent out of the class than acting as class clown inside it, so to speak.

Anyway, regarding the whole 'but China and India don't do it' argument, it's ironic idiocy by people who keep bashing the left with 'equality isn't fairness', yet do a volte-face in favor of equality over fairness when fairness doesn't work for them, thereby exposing right-wing rhetoric for the empty selfishness that it is. Also ironically, even as the US reneges on its pledges, both China and India are actually stepping UP their efforts and look now to be heading for over-shooting their previous commitments such that they may even (somewhat) make up for the US opting out - https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/05/15/trump-may-not-be-able-to-halt-the-worlds-climate-progress-thanks-to-china-and-india/?utm_term=.da6429f35c5c",0.0,0.0,,1WKoj-kodBw,

Yes, yes it would harm the US economy since regulations would need to be passed in order to reach the goals.  Resulting policies would have increased electricity costs for a family of four between 13 and 20 percent annually. The study also projected American families would see over $20,000 of lost income by year 2035.

Obama and every else obsessed with global warming aren't concerned with the well being of the rabble masses.  Fuck everyone so long as people like yourself and feel good about yourself.

If the world is moving toward cleaner greener tech innovation then great?  Why do we need the Paris Accord if it's going to happen anyways?  Leaving the agreement doesn't mean all of that stops, you know that right?

Again, why would not being a part of the Paris nonsense block us from taking advantage of innovation again?  Your claim makes no sense.

1) Reducing CO2 emissions (from fossil fuels) does not solve anything, it just moves the problem futher into the future
2) There might be more impact on the environment from polution, mass fishing and so on.
3) Globalizations means a lot of invading species, the ecological balance is changing on the global level and the biodiversity goes down, it is hard to get data on what part of that change is because of the climate change and what is because of invading species and what is because of shaping the nature around us by having large crops and building roads and cities...
4) Adapting to changes might be in many cases better solution than trying to stop something unstoppable
5) Climate will change even without our input... hard to tell whether it will change for the better or the worse. I think that global warming might be preferable to an ice age.

Anyway the systems involved are so complex I think it makes most sense to move to ""circular"" economy. Do not make any pollution (or as little as possible) that is not offset by nature quickly. If the technology will be developed and used around that concept, the pollution should be not existent. Making more efficient things is nice and all, but for as long as fossil fuels are burned the CO2 levels will rise. Also there is trouble with large population of cattle and methane.

The CO2 levels aren't low. 

What's bad about this is that CO2 acts as a greenhouse gas, causing light from the sun to effectively become trapped in the atmosphere instead of reflecting off the Earth (your point about specific gravity, which is not a real thing, but I'll assume you meant density, is irrelevant due to the changing temperatures and pressures in the atmosphere that cause convection currents.). The conditions in the Earth (as you say, that God designed) were optimal to have enough of a greenhouse effect to maintain a temperature suitable for life. However, due to the increased CO2 concentration(and other gases), more radiation is now trapped, increasing global temperatures. 

Your assumption that a 1/2 degree change (which is inaccurate, it's about 0.8K) is normal fluctuation is simply untrue (https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/DecadalTemp), normal fluctuation bounds are much lower. 

Your anecdote about a solar flare is just an anecdote, and as you said, it changed temperatures the next day only. So, it cannot possibly be used to justify the increase in temperature of over 100 years that matches perfectly with the increase in CO2 concentration. 

Lastly, the ice caps are not expanding. You might be confused with a report stating that NASA covered an expanded range in the Arctic in 2017, meaning more planes took more pictures. have  a look at (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHE0n5c6-6g) for a cute animation of the ice cap melting.",0.0,1.0,,1WKoj-kodBw,

Other countries do have less stringent targets therefore more production will happen there. As companies shift production to these countries more CO2 will be released this will actually increase CO2 in the atmosphere. By pulling out of the Paris agreement the US isn't changing its current EPA limits. If you can keep manufacturing here and or bring it back this does improve the US economy and actually reduce CO2 release on a global scale. The US is also the worlds largest consumer if products are produced here it should reduce shipping and the CO2 released do to that. Supply and demand dictates only so much of a product can be produced before its unprofitable.  And yes the US is wealthy but it is decreasing there is a given amount of wealth on the planet and if we are sending our wealth overseas we will continue to decline until it is depleted.

So to say any country not taking advantage in this form of energy is gonna loose out in investment is rediculous. You can't expect industrializing nation's around the world who are trying to get caught up to move to clean energy when it's less efficient, looses them money, gets rid of jobs, and is plain horrible for industrializing. America and Europe both went through the process of industrializing we just did it earlier. Now countries like China and third world countries are at that stage and we expect them to follow Western ideals in getting clean energy when they see no benefit in it to their economy.

""The IPCC has been caught modifying climate data and removing entire climate fluctuations from historical data""

no, they have not been. the IPCC merely writes reports that are summaries of the scientific literature on the topic. Be honest, did you ever read any of the IPCC reports or are you merely repeating claims you heard being made on the internet?

""do you not think all of their raw data should be available to the public""

no, for example, the raw data from temperature measurements from space (it was a satellite datasets, RSS, that showed no warming) is absolutely useless to non experts. ist not even temperature measurements, from that data, which is actually avaible , they calculate temperatures.

or often when meassuring Methods change over time, like with Ocean temperature measurements, in the past they meassured it on ships, today we use automatic floats. but the measurements are different, so a bunch of experts we figuring out how to adjust the data to make it a usefull dataset.
the raw data only would show several ¬∞C difference  at the point we changed method.
if you dont know the method changed, you might think over night the Oceans cooled of several ¬∞C. when we know they did not.

Fact: CO2 is absolutely critical for life on this planet. CO2 is as important to plants as oxygen is for humans.

Fact: Nobody can accurately predict the future with 100% certainty. Nobody knows whether the climate of the future will be severe or mild. Much of what is said about climate change is speculation, not fact. 

Fact: Solar, which is touted a focal point for renewable energy but only provides energy for about half the day and only when it's sunny. 

Fact: Government have a bad history in terms of predicting which industries will be successful or not. (Look at ethanol). 

Fact: ""Fossil Fuels"" are cheap, reliable and plentiful and have helped alleviate poverty for billions. 

Fact: Weather and climate related deaths have been going down for decades, because energy has been made cheaper. (A/C and heating)

I point out fact #1 because many people including the guy this video often refer to CO2 as a pollutant. Plants grow taller and faster when exposed to more CO2. Also, many people assume CO2 just means higher temperature, it could also mean more plants. People are only looking at a distorted picture when they focus on only the potential negatives. There could be some potential positives as well.

For #2, climate alarmists rarely says whether future climate change will be severe or mild. It seems they would like us to assume we will have catastrophic climate change, but there is no basis to assume this. Future climate, even I were to concede that climate is being greatly influenced by Humans, could still very well be mild. 

People think solar is some great power source, maybe it is, but it cannot escape nature. In order for an energy source to be effective, it needs to have these three attributes: It needs to be plentiful, cheap and reliable. Even If I concede that its cheap and plentiful.(it certainly isn't that cheap) Solar will always be unreliable. There are times when solar will provide ZERO energy, therefore, you'll need reliable sources to back it up, such as Oil. Basically, Solar isn't a long-term answer for replacing oil.

I point out #4 because this video is talking about the Paris agreement. 


Oil provides energy for virtually every human activity. Cheap energy makes farming more productive. It powers hospitals, schools and helps turn night into light. It allows us to be incredibly more productive and helps keeps us alive. As Alex Epstein has pointed, if your serious about having a debate, than you cannot discount the incredible benefits oil as given us. When you increase the cost of energy, you hurt every sector of society and raise the cost for everything. Because every sector benefits from cheap, reliable and plentiful energy. 


Yes, for #6, it always stuns me to remember, that nature didn't give us a climate that was livable, we transformed nature into a livable climate. Climate is harsh, over 100 years ago, something like 30,000 people a year might die from climate-related deaths. Today, its like a few dozen or a few hundred, I forget. The point is, the reason those deaths went down is because of ""fossil fuels"". If you want to save lives, we need to use more oil, not less.

Even if every country abides fully with the terms of the Paris accord, over the course of 100 years, climate change will only be ""delayed"" by a few months, according to their own scientists. But how much money would the US government lose during that 100 year time span vs how much money foreign governments (like china and India) will gain during that same time span? The Paris accord is all about money. Actual research needs to go into climate change to even establish to what degree humans even influence climate change. We don't know. The simple truth is, the climate has always, and always will, change naturally here on earth as we go in, and out, of ice ages and warming periods. Climate science is much to new to make any accurate predictions regarding this because actual research regarding it keeps getting stifled by liberals.

That aside, I agree with you that it's a good thing when people come together to solve problems in the absence of ""leadership"" from the federal government.  Honestly, that's how the country is supposed to work.  We're not supposed to look to or embrace a federal government that tells us what to do and what not to do, and we're not supposed to insist that the federal government embrace a consensus with the people via legislation or diplomacy.  The star of this show is the people, not the government.  The federal government is just a construct that does two things: to provide the simplest possible framework for a code of conduct based on values that are universal to the human experience, and to organize a defense against imminent threats to those values when those threats are of a scale that the states can't handle.

What can I say about everything else?  You're more or less right about the numbers as they've been reported, but display far more confidence in them than you likely should.  It's easy and common to use creative accounting, miss or forget an important aspect, or make a mistake, which make a certain solution or a certain company seem more appealing or healthier than it actually is (or vice versa), and while you correctly point out some of the more obvious hidden costs of fossil fuels, I wonder about the hidden costs associated with renewable energy solutions.  The fact is that these systems are so complex that anyone who claims anything with a high degree of confidence is immediately suspect of lack of rigor.  But if you can point me to a complete body of evidence with the actual, clear calculations of costs for both fossil fuel and renewable resource solutions for every step of the process beginning from when we look for them in the ground to what happens after we use the electricity supplied through our electrical sockets, and that evidence allows us to very clearly draw the conclusion that one solution, in its totality, is better for the economy over the other, I would be happy to accept your claim after reviewing the evidence.  I would, of course, not be satisfied with some simple chart or graph.

One can argue that there's enough data to show a trend, but one could also make a counter argument that that data was obtained by a large number people, some of whom likely have an interest in a certain result and some of whom believe their personal position on the subject to be completely rational until (or despite) an opponent examines it and points out holes and flaws, and that cases, in which data obtained by people demonstrated a conclusion that was later completely reversed, exist and are readily found throughout history in great numbers.

But it's my belief that, despite the Paris agreement or the Obama administration or anything else, the US would still have moved in the direction that it has, and will still continue in that direction even when Trump has exited the agreement, with the one key difference of less government involvement to bog down the process.  I think this difference is at the heart of not only Trump's decision, but of his base's support for it, and one of the key reasons why he even garnered the votes to be elected in the first place.  And the rest of the US political spectrum, not realizing this or attaching importance to it, has only tried to rationalize it in terms that they themselves can understand, but in terms in which Trump's base does not, and never will, think.",0.0,0.0,,1WKoj-kodBw,

If you consider that someone might not want a commitment that they don't intend to keep, then the economic argument isn't being addressed by your objection. As for green energy tech, that is to some extent happening in the private sector, but this notion that government not investing will harm the economy is nonsense. Case in point: Solyndra. As for a carbon tax not impacting GDP, that's because the GDP calculation is bunk. If you're counting government spending then you're not getting a realistic look at the economy as a whole.
2. The notion that the government should lead investment is stupid. Again: Solyndra. As for carbon emissions, this isn't creating a huge cost to the environment, no. And if it were then you'd have the problem of the government getting the money from said externality while the US DoD is the biggest polluting entity in the world. *Also externalities are handled through a civil court system, not through government taxes.*
3. Yes, India and China are still developing. Yes, curbing emissions more would harm their growth. But wait a minute, I thought it wasn't something that would harm growth so which is it? Nevertheless, the fact that it would harm their economic development is irrelevant when you're talking about a level playing field.
4. The IPCC was putting US involvement as making an impact of something like .1 degree Celsius. That's the *most* optimistic, not the least.
5. You're probably right on this one. However, I couldn't care less about what's popular.
6. Of course environmentalists don't care about the economy or human well being.

Also lets be clear on something the heathcare system is a double edged sword, because 1 the lack of income for low income families, and because it threatens harsh punishment for those that don't have it. Before obama care you could still go to the ER and get treated without a dime faster than any country with ""free health care (coff coff that you canada) You would still have to pay the bill off, but your not blocked from treatment at all. Trust me i paid off over $100k for my mother who live  life where she could not speak forming words like we can and had seizures every few days. A woman that could not even wash herself at times. That state and federal government still helped us in may ways I was raised by the states dollar honestly. This idea that the usa government and practices hurt the poor are out of people that feel they always deserve more. No me and my family deserved nothing from anyone. If you can't stand on your own you should fall no matter the reason.  Now That does not mean you have to, and that is why am happy with the socialist systems in place that help people that need the help even if some abuse it. Both Healthcare Systems implemented by Obama and Trump don't always help a wide audience, but adds another bill to pay for families that are already scrapping to get by that would have had to pay their medical bills anyways once they come up. It's even worse than that, because now rather just garnish wages it gives them the ability to arrest a father or mother that is doing their best to provide for a family. And Trumps is the worse of the 2 making it harder for limiting health care to states you live in without jumping through wholes to shop else were. I can only view these takes on healthcare, as the same as minimum wage. They are designed in suck a way to keep a population done dependent on the state. My insurance mind you I have had no medical emergency in my life would be over $400 dollars a month based on a birth defect I was born with. I'll you wonder or not if that's something I'm willing to play. Don't take a stance on something just because some stupid agenda you have against or for someone. Take a stance on something, because you 1 directly have seen outcome and effect of the policy or situation, and because you understand the subject enough to have a stance.

Germany started investing in Solar back in the 2000s, when solar was around $10 a watt to install vs. today where it's closer to $3 a watt installed. That means that if they invested those funds today, their energy costs would actually be about the same as the U.S., seeing as how their power would now be 3x cheaper than it is now.

That being said, it created a lot of jobs in Germany, roughly 350,000 or so, and those investments at that time helped solar become as cheap as it is now, being competitive with even coal as the cheapest form of energy, with prices still dropping. This was the point of the video, a poor country would by default not be able to afford the $10 a watt installed for electricity, but a rich country like Germany could. Now, because of those investments, solar is on par with, and on track to becoming, cheaper than coal so that poorer countries can use those forms of power now.

Jesus Christ, why did I read past this point... and you had the nerve to call _my_ counter-argument weak? Tell me solar power's not unreliable the next time a hurricane hits the Gulf Coast and cloud cover drops power generation to a trickle for days at a time during a national crisis event.

""Tidal, hydro, and wave power are all 100% reliable too!""

I _very much beg to differ._
https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2011/12/can-tides-turn-the-tide/
https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2011/12/how-much-dam-energy-can-we-get/

TL;DR- Even assuming your location has the facilities necessary for tidal or hydro power, you would never be able to get them to hold anything close to a majority of the power generation necessary for a state.

"" It does not say you must use wind and solar. It leaves both the targets and the methods for achieving the targets up to each country to decide. If wind and solar are not the best choice then they won't be chosen.""

And they aren't being. None of them are, because none of them are capable of carrying anything close to the brunt of the country's power needs, not even collectively. Borrowing a quote from one of the links posted:

_""To be clear, I‚Äôm not trying to discourage pursuit of any viable alternative to fossil fuels. What I do want to discourage is the sense of comfort we get because we‚Äôve heard of lots of solutions to our energy problems (tidal, wave, geothermal, energy from trash, etc.). When we imagine a smorgasbord of options in front of us, we think we‚Äôll never go hungry. But when the plate arrives and it‚Äôs a raisin here, a crumb of bread there, and a speck of cheese there, the variety alone is no longer a source of satisfaction.""_

I'm against subsidies of all sorts. I don't think any industry should be getting subsidized. The reason we use oil has nothing to do with the fact that it's getting invisible subsidies. We use oil, because over centuries of trial and error, the marketplace has determined that's it's the cheapest, most plentiful and reliable source of energy we have. 

Solar is unreliable because it is intermittent! 

_We can predict the exact time, down to the nearest minute, hundreds of years into the future._ << This is complete baloney. You think yourself a time wizard who understands climate weather with 100% accuracy? Cloud formation is incredibly complex, and we have enough trouble predicting it 7 days from now, let alone 10 years. Not to mention, there are other factors that could happen. What if there is a freak volcano eruption that occurs that covers the skies for days or a forest fire? 

The fact is, there is a little phenomenon known as night. Maybe you heard of it? Its when the sun goes missing for half the day! The best you can ever hope for is that Solar is used along with oil. It has virtually no chance of *replacing* oil. Since there are times of the day when solar provides ZERO energy, you'll need the entire oil infrastructure to back it up. Because Oil is is reliable and solar isn't! _Maybe_ in 60-100 years, solar could replace oil in some really sunny places, but even that is doubtful. 

Also, I got nothing against hydro power. That tends to be limited to certain regional areas, though. 

The Paris agreement is a boondoggle that is going to do everything it can to hurt the oil industry which is the most reliable, cheapest and successful source of energy we have. Billions of lives depend on having accessing to cheap energy. Governments should not be choosing what energy were using, that should be left up to the marketplace and the choices of billions of individuals. What the Paris agreement wants to do is replace the choices that billions have freely made and replace it with the choices of a few powerful elites in the vague hope that it might influence climate a century from now.

You've switched from saying solar is only competitive because it gets subsidies to saying coal gets even more subsidies than solar because it's competitive.  Your current argument contradicts your earlier argument.

Solar isn't unreliable.  It's intermittent. It's 100% reliable that the sun will rise each morning. We can predict the exact time, down to the nearest minute, hundreds of years into the future. We know exactly how much energy we can get from solar and when we'll get it.
Tidal, hydro and wave power are all 100% reliable too.  If any of them stop working we'll have much bigger problems than electricity.

The only ""unreliable"" sustainable energy source is wind. But even that can be predicted days in advance and most of the uncertainty and variance disappears over geographically distributed areas.  In practice, wind power is providing reliable energy as well.

Even if everything you said is true, it's still no reason to leave the Paris Agreement. It does not say you must use wind and solar. It leaves both the targets and the methods for achieving the targets up to each country to decide. If wind and solar are not the best choice then they won't be chosen.

Even if I concede that solar and wind are plentiful and cheap (not cheap yet) they will likely be unreliable for a very long time. There are times of the day when solar provides ZERO energy.

That's oil. you might say what about batteries you say. numerous problems with batteries. technology is likely decades away and is expensive as well. maybe deep in the future, this tech can be used, but today is foolish to do so.

Oh, very interesting. Well, I think the only thing you've 
shown is that Germans and Americans live different lives with different lifestyles.

There's a lot of questions that can be asked about 
this, though. Like, why do Americans use more energy than German 
households? Presumably, Americans use a lot more energy. Part of the reason may be because energy is cheaper. If Germans had cheaper energy, would they use more? Also, in your article, it mentioned most Germans don't have Air Conditioning! I don't know about you, but I happen to think A/C makes life much better. 

The way I see it, life is better when energy is cheaper. Keep in mind, we've only been talking about households, but what about industry? They use tons of energy, if German companies have to pay more for energy, that means higher costs, which could mean less jobs and higher prices for goods and services. 

Also, the main point is that Solar and Wind haven't proven themselves be a a boost to the economy. In fact, energy prices have continued to rise. I did a quick search, and a rough estimate is that Germany gets ~27% from renewable energy. They have plans to get to 80%. Imagine How much more energy prices will continue to rise in Germany if they continue on their path? And is this what we really want to happen for America?

In this context it should also be noted that a German household uses significantly less power than, for example, an US household.

Their ideal is a fantasy. But they seem to reckon that, in the mean time, socialism and progressivism in general are desirable. In practice, they only serve for state socialism/communism to further take hold, since they only actively oppose its nemesis. True liberalism. Libertarianism, as it's now called.

You can never really buy out all competing goods as the market will find alternative replacement.  Say if you horde all the pork and set it at higher than market price, you'll only reduce the market consumption of pork and drive up consumption of other kind of meat, ultimately you'll most likely ended up losing money for your business acquisition.  It's just a horrible business strategy that no one practices it in the real world. 

And no, universal healthcare is not necessarily better.  I admit our healthcare system have problems but so does most countries that have government run universal healthcare.  For one, it's a big financial hole for their country that is ultimately being paid by the tax payer, and in many cases, doctors and nurses are fleeing the system since they are being overworked, deteriorating quality in healthcare is also a common sight for those countries that has national healthcare.

As to the topic of free market, yes I agree with you that there will never be a true free market as taxation and some form of market oversight will always be needed. However it has proven time and time again in history where there are less invasive market oversight and regulations, lower taxes, the more prosperous the country will become. Like east and west Germany, Taiwan/Hong Kong and pre 90s China, north and South Korea, the list goes on and on.  America become more prosperous than any country in the 19th century with no federal income tax and minimal government intervention of economy.

The 2008 bailout did not solve any structural issues in our economy, it's merely kicking the can down the road.

It was an entanglement that can only come at a cost to the highest developed country.  It was about emotion, not policy.  We don't need emotional relationships with other nations.  If they haven't been able to develop and not keep pace with us, there is a reason. It was an attempt to apply pressure even though the agreement has no real teeth, that was veiled as an appeal to goodness.

Nothing is stopping the government, or people on their own, from being as green as possible.  Lo and behold, it's actually served as an impetus for local US governing bodies to take their own initiative.  You know, a thing conservatives value that is called ""states rights"".  

The role of the US government is NOT to control the people, but to serve the people.  It is there to protect from people, enemies and domestic.  And that's about it.  It provides some basic services otherwise, like some infrastructure and the post office system.

That's it.  The government is not meant to be a benevolent provider.  It is not meant to be worshiped or trusted by the people.  It is meant to be answerable to the people.  You could do with some remedial civics courses if you still don't understand.

We will no longer submit to the false song of globalism.  If you want socialism on scale, you can move to a country that has it.  That's the thing.  We're an independent nation, not part of the herd.  If we fail, we don't drag half the world down with us.  If the European union fails, many nations all go down.  If we were a global one-government situation, becoming a refugee would be literally impossible.  Socialism relies on the state to control things.  This is authoritarian in nature and removes the choice of free will.  The whole point of the US was to get away from that.  That's a bonus of not putting all your eggs in one basket.

Bullshit. Microsoft didn't have a near monopoly in operating systems because ""da Feds"" said they had to. Most monopolies aren't protected monopolies. Fact is, wealth concentrates. Wealthy businesses use that wealth to make more wealth and they use that wealth to protect their status.

When Starbucks moves into a new location and deliberately operates at a loss in order to crush smaller businesses who can't survive selling at a loss for months at a time, that isn't a government regulation. In fact the only time that's been stopped that I know of is when a government has stepped in and told Starbucks to shove it.

Creating a monopoly is easy and regulations prevent every market being a monopoly. It's the first thing you'd learn is that markets originally were extremely regulated which is why people were comfortable trading at them.

If security is provided, if buyers and sellers have protections from the others, then commerce becomes easy. In a might makes right world without any regulations then wealth concentrates and monopolies and cartels form.

When a mega-conglomerate decides it wants less competition, what's the easiest way to pull that off? Lobby and bullshit the populace into feel-good regulatory nonsense which ONLY leads to an unfair market levied in favor of said mega-conglomerates, because they're the only ones capable of sifting through the regulatory bullshit while still being able to afford the cost of doing business. If there were no regulations, the truly free market would decide what it wants based on WHAT IT WANTS. If half of America wants clean energy, smaller businesses can provide that much needed change at a cheaper cost. However, if they need to hire fleets of attorneys just to keep the lights on, the cost goes way up and then we are talking about economies of scale... the big businesses win. That's why the biggest, ""baddest"" corporations are always in favor of regulatory nonsense that seemingly hurts their industry... they're the only ones who will be able to afford the fallout.

part 2. agreed for a good deal, but there's a lot of things we could change to pollutants and tax people on, but idk if that's going to work out on our wallet at the end of the day, we worry about govt taking over the energy because we don't want eventual rations on energy, you're analogy ignores the morality aspect of free markets in favor for a bad understanding of free markets being based solely in profits (not a fair way to display you're point imo) but you are right we need to ensure the market is fair but I think there is better ways than just taxing. 

part 3. I agree with so much but what are the implications of allowing these top population countries not to worry about emisions? I think it pales our 350 million population effect in regards to co2 emissions, they have massive amounts of people.

part 4. if it doesn't do anything what's wrong with pulling out and trying for something that does? I mean no matter how much you hate trump that is the plan. you said it was a good starting point now let's go further right? you could say this is better because the Accord was non binding so it was already doomed to fail.

part 5. I think that the polls could be misinterpreting 'protect the environment' for 'we need Paris accord', very rarely are things done solely in response to something being politically unpopular, but you really can't fight numbers, but as the treaty never went to congress the people never got the chance to vote on it so who knows.

You dove right into that pool of crap like the people at the end of the movie The Magic Christian... only you are diving for money, you are diving for prestige, to make yourself look good by siding with the Paris Agreement.

So, 1) you don't understand how treaties work.
2) You claim there are droughts and worse storms, which isn't the case.
3) You blame CO2, which isn't the case. CO2 is not a pollutant, it is a fertilizer and needed to support live in a natural manner.
4) You didn't seem to understand the free market, as you don't know that the technology has improved what is needed and has failed when government tries to manipulate it (see the failing green energy industry in Europe or the various investments in failing companies here in America). That's where the cost goes bad.
5) If a company dumps its pollution in a river, a) it does direct harm and is fined b) the people in charge go to jail c) the consumers stop buying their services or products. You example might be correct in China, where the government is supporting the pollution.
6) The United States already reduces it's emissions, but your ""myth"" about China isn't held up. China has outright said they won't do anything until after 2030, after the treaty. But there is no guarantee they will do anything then. And until then, they said they plan to increase their emissions.
7) The best estimates, if the entirety of this agreement were to be followed (and you said it is a suggestions and not binding), and if this were to stay at where it is past 2030 to make it to 2117, the reduction of global warming would be around 0.3 degrees C less of an increase. Not a decrease of 0.3 degrees C, but a decrease in increase. It would save the world by about 4 months... maybe. Heck, Under the government plan here in the USA we would only decrease our increase by 0.03 degrees C, and other than inspiration you don't need the USA on this.
8) It is estimated that if the government doesn't take money out of the economy and waste it, both losing the money from bureaucratic overhead and from bad investments, the resulting technology would be at least what it has over the past 20 years.  In a 2016 report from the EPS (that's before Trump) CO2 emissions between 1990 and 2005 (25 years) have increased 7% and between 2005 and 2015 (10 years) have decreased 7%. Part of this is because the economy was minimal and part of this was because fracking and natural gas has replaced oil and coal in a natural manner (against government wishes). Under the Paris Accord this would not have happened because fracking is, to borrow a German word, verbotten.

If CO2 is the cause, then the United States already has a treatment and is working on a cure. The free market would circulate this cure, and charity would boost the potency. So, why should the USA pay trillions of dollars to a bad deal that doesn't work and is, at least in the USA, binding?",0.0,0.0,,1WKoj-kodBw,

No one is forcing the states and cities to stop with the goals that the U.S. originally made.  They may even actually make the goal much faster without the federal government being in charge because cities and states don't have as big of hoops to jump through and the people in the areas can actually see it happening.  True conservatism is about a small federal government meant to make laws to protect the people, while having progressive and influential city and state governments to make decisions on social and economic policy.  The real problem is most Republicans have ditched this idea and have either sided with Trump who is a populist that believes in a big government, just not the same one that liberals do, or have started to lean more left than right just to stay in D.C.  There are a lot of issues that I think should be left up to the states to decide and I believe that this is one of them as well.

This is all a Presidency, as it was designed, was ever meant to do, and it was also all that was ever possible, because no President was ever god-like in wisdom or precognition, or could be. The personality trait of not minding vociferous, outraged pundits is required to make a decision based on its merits. But, until Trump, it had been completely accepted as a catastrophic political liability by expert politicians.

 What people do in assessing Trump is mistake the media toreador for Trump the thinker. Trump knows what he is trying to do while in the media (defeat it), even if nobody else can figure out quite what he means, by plotting his moves, as toreador, beforehand in thinker mode. The toreador does not reason with the bull, who is unaffected by reason, to defeat it. But Trump always makes decisions privately in thinker mode.

 Everybody agrees, probably, that if reducing CO2 saved money overall, then people would be doing the things that reduce CO2, just to save money, if for no other reason. From this, we should conclude, correctly, that reducing CO2 costs something. Yet pointing to a case where the economy was still good, though the CO2 was in fact reduced, is supposed to show that CO2 is not economically bad. The fact remains that whatever was spent on reducing CO2 would have spent on whatever it had spent on before it had been spent to reduce CO2. So whatever that was, people are without it. That is the only sense of CO2 reduction being inevitably negative economically. If people have plenty anyway, then the cost of CO2 reduction may only take very little from them, and the economy will still seem good. However this comes with a warning about how economics calculates, which I will mention next.

 Economics is neutral about what people spend money on. If you spend money on lipstick and tattoos, or if you spend money on food for your children, it is just the amount of money spent that is counted. So, applied to CO2, you may spend 5% on CO2 reduction; or you may spend 95% on CO reduction, and be starving in a dark hut, but economics calculates it equally in dollars. Just because the economy is working equally either way, according to calculation, does not mean you have the same things.",0.0,0.0,,1WKoj-kodBw,

With no agency to monitor nor track that kind of cash flow, let alone prosecute anyone who would misuse funding, the whole thing just becomes some crony's wet dream. So we have a very large cash flow with no way to track or prosecute those who abuse it even if they were to get caught? Yeah, that won't draw in any corruption at all... I can see why so many countries signed on, and if you think it's because they care about curbing CO2 emissions... Well, would you believe the word gullible is written in blood on your ceiling right now?

Countries participating would have to employ agencies for such situations. ie America has a corrupt individual misusing finances? America must prosecute that person. Brittan/France/Germany has such a person as well? The courts of those countries must prosecute those individuals. And so forth. Without some mechanism in place to track funds, and a viable mode of prosecution for abusers there is no way I would sign on either. 

Even then there are still going to be problems surrounding this. There needs to be threat of major international sanctions, and blockades if the Paris Agreement is to hold any weight. Otherwise this thing is toothless and will accomplish little to nothing other than create a cesspool of corruption.

2: Countries like China don't have to do anything till 2030? They're just getting into their industries and are growing, and it's not fair to have them curb emissions at this time? Isn't one of the whole premises of this to do something NOW? Because time is of the essence? Sorry, life isn't fair get over it. NA and EU shouldn't have to cowl down and roll out the global market red carpet for them just because our forebearers were successful.

China is holding to their targets, and are expected to reach them earlier than 2030 you say? And what if they don't? What if by 2029 December 31st they just tell everyone to get fucked? We just practically gave them free economic reign over the globe for no reason. And remember, participation is voluntary and there are no repercussions to backing out.

3: The Paris Agreement as it stands right now has zero bearing on anything. Countries who are going to find ways to curb emissions will curb emissions and countries who will not curb their emissions won't. Regardless of weather they are signed onto the Paris Agreement or not. So what is even the point other than to dole out multi-billions only to potentially get swept up by economic pariahs?

Not to mention the end result of all this is a .2 degree Celsius reduction by 2100? Over 80 years of all of this for a reduction that is only one tenth of where it needs to be? And that's under a baseless assumption that all of this will go off without a hitch (highly unlikely). But hey, it's the thought that counts right Derek? Are you serious?

The solution to the issues isn't the damn Paris Agreement. We'll do what we've always done, and what we should do. The solution is to innovate. Build multi phase nuclear power plants, innovate for more efficient solar and geothermal tech, get into material sciences and find more efficient ways to build hybrid technology that makes it more affordable and easily manufactured, invent better scrubbing technology to clean already existing CO2 in the atmosphere.

*""You are implying that the policies that America would be made to follow would have a significant effect on the perceived problem ...""*
Legit question that is meant without condescension: Are we speaking about general policies or the paris agreement? I'm speaking more generally since the statement I was responding to was in regards to whether or not foreign countries should be affecting our policies.

And yes, America being 30% of the world's contributor makes it significant.

*"".. while being quite devastating to the economy.""*
Did I say anything about the economic effects or was this merely an error in your wording? I didn't comment on the economic effects, so I'm not sure what you meant.

*""The agreement promises a miniscule and insignificant reduction in temperature in exchange for massive unemployment and reduction in production.""*
[Citation needed]
If I assume that it's true that it's hurting employment and production ... what is your alternative? I would rather that people lose jobs than us ruin the planet and make it either unlivable or *extremely* difficult to live in. One hurts way more than the other, but that one that hurts more will take a good deal longer to truly hit at full force.

*""In addition to this, the permission of other countries to continue to produce without consequence effectively wipes out any possible American contribution to this issue.""*
That would only be the case if these other countries increase their emissions to the point that America's current effect becomes negligible compared to them. Otherwise, the U.S. going green would cut down a massive chunk. And regardless of the percentile effect, the idea is to get as *much* going as possible. You don't quit because *one* country changing has a minor effect compared to everyone else.",1.0,1.0,,1WKoj-kodBw,

*""Why should foreign leaders dictate policy that Americans act on.""*
Why should America's lazy policies and absolute refusal to do anything about climate change affect the health of the environment for the rest of the world that magnitudes more countries live in? America is not the planet. This isn't U.S. and anyone else can go fuck themselves. Besides: The U.S. *already* pretends to be bound by policies that involved foreign countries. You do know that the U.S. does pretend to follow international laws, and that those are a thing, right? I say ""Pretend"" because the U.S., thanks to shitty politicians, is breaking international laws anyway. Those laws are there to hold countries accountable for their actions, as opposed to every nation having the power to become Nazi Germany.

My description of currency movements is grossly simplified but still essentially true.  Because even if Bangladesh uses the US dollars to buy wind turbines from Germany, Germany still can't use them.  It has to pay its own citizens who made the turbines in Euros and it still has to get some value out of those US dollars.  Eventually, they *have* to be spent in the US where they finally actually go to a worker who does some work.  Nowhere else in the world can you get a worker to do some work with American dollars.

Which means that contributing that money to the GCF guarantees that somewhere along the line, someone will use it to employ American workers.  It won't necessarily be the country that first got the money, but it will happen.

The sin of simplifying some fairly complex money movements is to counter the biggest mistake people make when understanding ecoomics: thinking of it like a household budget.

Look, you don't have to like Donald Trump, but at least listen to what he says and understand why he did it. Phrase of the year is echo chamber for a reason, if you don't listen to both sides, you just hate people for no reason.

For those wondering, one of the reasons that economists cite as a good reason to leave is that the US is physically incapable of meeting the terms of the agreement within the time constraints. Since this agreement is just a formal way of saying ""Please do this"", and if the US doesn't comply with the agreement, because again, its impossible, what would that do to the agreement? Would it destroy it? The US has massive influence, and massive power, if they don't comply, why should smaller nations?

This sways your viewers into thinking that 3 eyed fish from the Simpsons will be running around since we left this agreement when that is a whole other unrelated issue. Also with this, the private ENERGY markets will catch up with green energy, when solar becomes worth its value the ""rich"" households will buy in large numbers, and will eventually run coal and oil plants to a point of minimal use, but cutting coal and oil off early will slow the production of green energy which is terrible for everyone. 
For your 3rd (4th?) point, China and India aren't paying, even though they are the highest contributors with the US. This is downright absurd that we are the only ones paying out of the top 3 and we are paying much more than anyone else, and just because they are ""developing"" doesn't mean that they are producing any less carbon than anyone else.

Rather than expected  natural variations who said ""average"" temp (which exists nowhere) should be constant to perhaps plus or minus 0.1C forever ? On a planet where the temp‚Äô ranges + or minus 50C, one degree in 100 years is hardly noticeable. But hey dont show those upper and lower limits on a graph, just show a Y axis increase of 1 degree over a 100years and you'll fool all the semi -literate baboons who are scared by such skullduggery  which ""proves"" global warming.  Actually, most of that minuscule ‚Äúwarming‚Äù occurred between 1978 -1998 and very little since. In fact 2013 was the coldest temperature on record in the US. It would only take 1 credible, verifiable piece of scientific data that proves beyond a reasonable doubt that fossil fuel is the *causation* of climate change/ And I dont mean just a correlation nor some manipulated lab based program or fudged computer model. 
Studies over 100s of millions of years show that temperature and CO2 are rarely in sync if at all and often 100s of years apart. There are any number of factors that affect climate and weather like sunspot activity, undersea volcanoes, wild bush fires, deforestation on a massive scale, urban sprawl, gravity effects of skyscrappers on coastal areas, changes or variation in the earth's orbit and magnetic field, plate Technics, etc. To claim that 1 part of CO2 in 2500 (0.04%) is a major contributor to anything other than photosynthesis, is pure speculation. When fossil fuel represents only a fraction of that 1 part of all atmospheric gases that conclusion is pure fabrication and fear-mongering.*When anyone of these Green zombies, rebellious teenagers and serial activists, or NGOs wave their ""save the planet"" flags what they are really working towards is ""controlling the planet"".* Its all about power b/c that's where the money is.

I recognize that climate change is a problem that needs to be solved, preferably as soon as possible, I'm not sure that the clean energy solutions we have right now are adequate. Most of the clean sources of energy we have are far too expensive to make switching away from fossil fuels entirely a viable option without immense increases in energy costs that would hurt the lives of nearly everyone except for the richest people. I feel  that for now we should continue using current energy sources while trying to invest in making clean energy cheaper so that we and the rest of the world can transition to clean sources of energy in a way that doesn't damage the standard of living for everyone.

So with the Paris Climate Agreement I wasn't sure if leaving it was a good or bad idea. What really made me decide that it's a bad idea to leave is the fact that it's non-binding. If it were a binding agreement, then you could argue that the United States would be better off without it because what it entails necessarily hurt our economy, but that's not the case. The Paris Climate Agreement is simply a goal, no more, no less. If the economics of clean energy  was really a problem, you could just choose to not do anything and the Paris Climate Agreement would be irrelevant.

1. ON 1 U concluded giving the reason ""it is non binding "" but this contradict on 3 ,U said US should lead the way which means US should Be binding in practical terms.
2. Therefore If US is Binding but China India are relaxed The market is not fair like U said. People will go for cheaper goods from companies in China n India who can dump their waste into the river and not bear the cost for pollution. This contradict Point 1.
3. US free market have worked. In 2016 US reduce CO2 emissions  more than any nation. And expert believe This will Continue.
4. Canada withdrew from Kyoto Protocol in 2012 which is the direct predecessor of Paris Climate agreement and has effectively reduced Carbon emissions. US can do the same without Paris.
4. US has close to 20 Trillion debt with 16 Trillion GDP while China has 1 Trillion debt with 12 Trillion GDP(not rich????)
 I'm pretty sure China will over take US economy in few years while India will get to 4 or 5 soon.
Specially when China PPP is ahead of US already economic prospects of countries like China and India are far better than US and EU.
So Will the Paris Agreement works??????
The Kyoto Protocol didn't....India made a huge pledge and commitment But didn't fulfill anything but point to China for excuse as China didnt do much either. Infact Kyoto Protocol have no effect on developing countries which is non Binding too.
Beijing in Dec 2016 recorded  air pollutants 20 times the WHO safety level while in October 2016 New delhi record air pollution 16 times the WHO safety level.
Hence what China and India will do in empirical terms it is not because of Climate change but a deliberate attempt to saves the lives of their citizens and to get aid.

      As you may know, we are activating Article V(5) of our Constitution, COS a Convention Of States. 

      A Term limits amendment is one of the top items on the agenda. I am concerned that too many of us are overlooking the Achilles heal of the proposed term limits amendments! 
      Ask yourself these questions! 
      Why would the American people impose upon themselves a system of government that demands amateurs? Such a system would only force good people,(Statesmen servants of the people,) out of term-limited offices, (?permanently?)
         How do we keep experienced (Statesmen servants of the people,) while limiting power grabs by professional politicians, bureaucrats, Lobbyist and rich elitist? Thomas Jefferson proposed strict term limits: 
        Jefferson wrote - Office holders must be incapable of being reelected to any office until he has been out of office three years. ?TERM GAPS?

Ours is a government of The People, we must be able to rotate citizen lawmakers in and out of government and back into the real world! If this is to be The Peoples Government we must become more effective citizens and Statesmen! 
     Term Gaps is a time out of politics and government! TERM GAPS IS A TIME TO LIVE AS ONE OF THE GOVERNED!
 
      Are TERM GAPS what our Founding Fathers intended when debating term limits? 

We must think generationally if we are to fix our environment!

Steel, iron ore and clean coal cut from 60%-80%. Millions of Jobs would have been lost due to this. Prices of not only energy but EVERYTHING would have gone up""

Point 1: Comparing the economy of British Columbia and the economy of US is like apple and orange. Furthermore, GDP growth is just one of the indicators of the overall economy and without supporting data from government spending, unemployment, labor participation rate etc there is no comparison (That's like saying India is stronger than Canada because India has higher nominal GDP and higher GDP growth)

I do have two issues with that: 1) US power and dominance in the world is mainly due to the strength of its economy (buying power) and military. Other factors matter too but they are insignificant compared to these two. The best way for US to remain as global superpower is to strengthen the economy and military. If the US were to decline as world superpower, it is fair more likely due to declining economy or military strength, not political correctness that Trump severely lack of. 

2) The cost of maintaining such relationship is incredibly high, so high that we need to decide whether it is economically justifiable to have such big deficit and debt to please other countries and pay for their costs.  Debt is growing at a rate of more than 1 trillion USD every year. This Paris Agreement might only be minor economic decisions for the US, but we are in such deep hole because we made countless of these ""minor economic decisions"" that constantly favor other countries either in global military expenses (NATO), Military defense for other countries (South Korea, Japan etc.), trade (currency manipulation, import duty and tax, unbalanced free trade agreements) etc.So yes, these decisions by Trump may affect US political and cultural influence on the world stage, but I am not sure how much longer the US can remain politically and culturally correct but economically incorrect.",3.0,1.0,,1WKoj-kodBw,

I totally agree with you that an embargo will not, at least short and mid-term wise, be implemented against the U.S.. But let me get the core of that argument. America, as of now, is a global power and, when seen out of a historical view, an empire with everything that comes with it: Global currency, military dominance and a massive political and cultural influence. A global power that was yet to be seen with this magnitude. But the one thing we learned from history: empires decline. Either gradually or disruptively given long enough time. Though a decline does not mean that they will be irrelevant, of course.
But there is something in the air, when you read the newspapers and listen closely to politicians especially outside of the U.S., a faint wind of change if you may. With recent events (though not exclusively) Europe is cautiously stretching its roots to the far east with China and India looking for new bonds that might be needed in the future. Those roots are still thin and if trump decides to change his ways or a new president is elected the tie between the old world and the new is still stronger.
What I am trying to depict here is that with decisions like these, the U.S. trying to unhinge itself for one-dimensional, debatable and in the big picture minor economic decisions, they lose influence. And ever so slightly, this lost influence piles up. It could start with e.g. Europe not wanting to support certain decision of U.S., stronger trade-agreements with other parties and so on. That is the point that I am not agreeing the most with president Trump. Americas influence, be it political, military and culture wise is not only a financial burden. It is Americas greatest asset. An asset that is depleting, ever so slightly, though lately with a magnitude which is unseen for the last 30 to 40 years. And that, in my opinion, is America‚Äôs greatest economical threat.

I think it is rather well documented the negative impact of climate control regulations to the economy (increase in cost of oil, curb job in related sector etc). In fact, almost all regulations have negative impact on the economy. Furthermore, if climate control regulations have no negative impact on the economy, I guess we don't even need the Paris agreement and all nations would implement such policy on their own right?

2. In order to discuss whether monopoly firm is ""fair"", we need to understand what is fair and why those monopoly firms became 1 in the first place. A firm with superior management, more resources and enjoys economies of scale SHOULD and WOULD have advantage over other competing firms. That is how they become monopoly firms in the first place. That's why free market is perfectly fair but may not be efficient.

3. Yes but why should US now obligated to give such advantage back to China and India? It is not the fault of the US that China and India are in their developing stage and what US achieved is sunk cost and should not even be in the discussion.

4. Nobody argue that Paris Agreement has no benefit but the argument is about the net gain of the US in this agreement.

5. I am sure you understand economics is the science of scarcity and decision making. Resources should be allocated to 1) the sector that have highest positive net gain for the US and 2) the sector that America citizens deem the most important. Why should an elected representative of a country allocate resources to an issue that is not important to American people (not even in the top 10). Get it?

Although it is technically possible, a trade embargo against the US is absolutely unlikely and such embargo would be catastrophic to the world economy as the US is still the engine of the world economy and the absolute largest buyer in the world. It just won't happen.

1: I think I understand what you're saying, but that still returns me to the original question: What are the economic foundations for thinking reduction of emissions is bad for the economy, long term or short term?

2: If you don't think monopolies are unfair, we probably have different definitions of unfair. The unfairness in a monopoly often comes from the absolute power to outperform anyone else even with worse ideas solely because of financial and market share backup. It is to be capable of outperforming someone better than you on merits that are irrelevant to the end product. Then again, I haven't learned the economic definition of fairness. :P

3: But that sunk cost has been spend on something, which has given the US a long-term benefit in terms of infrastructure and production of wealth, right?

4: He doesn't, I'll agree to that for sure. But, in context with the argument he puts up as a strawman of sorts, that makes sense - he has to prove that there is a positive.

5: That's still tangential to the original point, which focused on the popularity of the agreement.

I'll entertain the points either way, because I find the subject interesting. :P

The question really becomes, 'how did you prioritize this top 10?', as well as 'what about the moral issue?'. For example, if it truly is too unimportant to deal with economically speaking, you still have to make the moral choice after the fact. For example, slave labor was extremely profitable, but most people don't look at it with a keen eye today. The possible consequences of ignoring climate change is similar - the destruction of whole island nations, coastal cities, etc. Perhaps not in the US, but definitely abroad. The US would get hit too, of course, but the general nation would be capable of surviving most of the issues that come with climate change for a while to come.

Next comes the economic effect of pissing off the entire world. While trade embargoes towards the US are hard to imagine today, when you try to figuratively yet somewhat literally burn the world's economy at the stake for the sake of your own local economy, foreign relations can become sour enough to justify trade embargoes.

When it comes to the pure economics of it, I also find it hard to believe that the death of most of the fish in the ocean, increase in hurricanes, etc. will have a truly insignificant effect on the US economy.

Secondly, place your face 1 cm on the ground. You can't breath, right, because its all CO2 settled onto the ground, right? Well, no, because the density of gasses doesn't produce a simple liquid-like reaction of gasses created layers above each other, it just predicts how much they mix. Helium, for example, is lighter than air, but takes years to actually leave the atmosphere and we still have helium in the atmosphere despite an overall floating trend. CO2  mixes with air with an overall lowering trend but individual CO2 atoms do not sink to the bottom like lead in a pool, it takes a sporadic path that involves getting turned into O2¬†when reaching a ground level plant. This is speculation, but I imagine that if CO2 really were so heavy that it would sink to the bottom and create a layer of CO2 beneath a layer of O2, the greenhouse effect would actually be worse.

There is no doubt that a huge number of scare-tactics and corrupt political maneuvers have been involved in the creation of the narrative of global warming, and especially manmade global warming. But that doesn't mean there can't also be true elements to it.

Most ideas that exist have at one point been spread by mainstream propaganda for political reasons. People will use anything to try to gain power. Vaccines are good? That idea has, in the past, been pushed by a propaganda narrative in order for the government and the companies that makes those vaccines more powerful and to also create villains out of people who didn't accept them or didn't use them.

CO2 can absorb infrared radiation because its C=O bonds can stretch and bend. If CO2 didn't absorb infrared radiation, the Earth would be very cold to sustain life. So CO2 is good for the atmosphere. BUT (there's always a but) if there's *too much* CO2 in the atmosphere, it will absorb too much infrared radiation causing the greenhouse effect.

Eveyone focuses in the warming that is caused by CO2 increase. Of course it can get very complicated (it surely is), but CO2 doesn't have little to do. It's the whole thing that activates the climate change (beside sun fluctuations). My arguement is not that it is easy to fully understand the warming and make accurate predictions.

First of all, I didn't say that plants are equaling the forces of Co2 emission in magnitude. I just said that plant life is a negative feedback system in our benefit that will continue to grow to a certain point we are unsure of. I brought this up as the reason why, in the context of these positive feedback loops, the Earth is not already going to inevitably boil itself regardless of what we do. Again, this doesn't mean lusher jungles (although it could), the relevant plant life in question is thicker algae.

Second of all, I didn't say that Co2 is not a greenhouse gas, I said that it is not a relevant greenhouse gas, that it does ""almost nothing."" Its effects are as a catalyst, to the greenhouse effects of H2O, not as a direct problem. I brought this up both to defend the statement about CO2 and to explain why the climate models are very difficult to predict, as predicting a rise in temperature directly correlated to CO2 would be relatively easy compared to trying to predict the emergence of a feedback loop once the system reaches a critical point.

I didn't find the Derek you mentioned, but i really doubt the scientific community as a whole claims that CO2 is not a greenhouse effect.

Well he's right. Co2 does almost nothing as a greenhouse gas, Derek says this in his ""7 myths about climate change"" video. The problem is that Co2 creates a positive feedback loop with our oceans that releases water vapor, which is a potent greenhouse gas. Co2 isn't like a blank covering the Earth, the theory is that its a catalyst that will allow the oceans to boil themselves. This is because the slightly warmer air can hold more water, which leads to much warmer air. That's why the climate models have always  been so off, because the exponential rise and when exactly the feedback loop will start is objectively difficult to predict, and impossible for us to predict at our currently level of scientific understanding. Al Gore thought the feedback loop would start by 2010, but was wrong. Now people think the feedback loop will start by 2100. Others have always said 2100. It's not well understood, but also understandably so because it is reliant on our incomplete understanding of how a variety of factors may converge together. Ultimately, as long as the negative feedback loop of Co2 producing more plants that take more Co2 is greater than the positive feedback loop of Co2 leads to slightly higher temperatures which leads to water vapor which leads to much higher temperatures, we are fine. But we don't know how to predict either of these feedback loops in the context of the Earth and we are just guessing. However, we are sure that given enough time they will eventually do something bad so we don't want to test all of the Earth's negative feedback loops and see how far we can go putting Co2 in the atmosphere.


If we were to not have oceans, we have no reason to believe that increased Co2 to even ridiculously high amounts like 1000 or 2000 ppm would be a problem for global warming. It's the feedback loops that are the problem, not the Co2 itself. In addition, its unclear how much the negative feedback loops of the Earth will help us out, which also makes long term prediction impossible. When we were at 250 ppm (now we are at 400) of Co2, 250 ppm was getting removed every year by plants. However, as the Co2 levels have increased, the Co2 getting removed by plants (don't imagine jungles or trees, mainly algae) has increased as well. It just hasn't been increased quickly enough to keep up with how quickly we are increasing Co2 production. Most people agree that if we were to not increase our Co2 production at all starting today and have this amount for the rest of history, we would be fine, because the Earth's negative feedback systems would keep up with us.",4.0,1.0,,1WKoj-kodBw,

Such a legal protection protects the USA from these hypothetical Manchurian candidates that would¬†turn the USA into a puppet state, and with so much hysteria over OBAMA being that, and TRUMP being that, and even BUSH JR being that, we need to¬†go by the book. If we toss the book, then whose to say all those hysterical mobs¬†are wrong?¬†¬†¬†

#1¬†A) This nation already imposes both federal & state fuel taxes on its¬†citizens that they pay at the pump, this is an adjustable tax that can be applied to¬†any fuel source. But¬†how is¬†THAT STRATEGY really¬†working for us at the pump? Such taxes hit the poor the hardest exacerbating the inequalities that the left champion they have all the fixes for, and yet do not curb the¬†travel of the rich in the slightest! And if it did,¬†oh there would be hell to pay. No, instead, they buy new teslas,¬†or w/e else is electric or hybrid tthese days, they get a tax¬†credit for that which is money in their pocket, plus they no longer pay at the pump taxes meant to keep our roads and highways properly maintained leading to increases in accidents, road & bridge¬†failures! When the poor are paying¬†almost a dollar a gallon in¬†stacked taxes in their used cars which is all they can afford. B) in the political¬†history of the world, non-binding agreements have a snaky way of becoming binding at the least convenient times. ¬†

So, really, I don't buy cap&trade¬†or the¬†carbon-tax strategies as limiting the emissions because the rich find a way to¬†externalize those costs, if they so choose, one way or another, and they're excessive lifestyles¬†ultimately have the biggest¬†carbon footprints,¬†outside of maintaining national¬†security, which is also mostly to their benefit once everyone else is so worked & taxed to death for the commute to and from their¬†employers, they become disabled¬†poor¬†and on government assistance.¬†¬†Instead, you've got to lower costs of production, increase supply of the things you find desirable, just because it's not a fair-race doesn't mean you can't win it, especially when it's bullshit to say their isn't already carbon-taxes in place in the USA. Sales tax is a consumption tax. Fuel taxes are consumption tax. It more than well enough limits and changes the survival strategies & daily activity of the poor, and if it did so in such a profound way upon the rich, now that would be a hell of a thing, but it doesn't. ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

2#¬† I'm glad you agree with this. But look again at #1 A. Also, I the history of the world, we've had cold periods with higher co2 than we have now, and warmer periods than we have now. Co2 is not the only greenhouse gas, nor is it the only factor in the earths variable climate-change. Civilization started during the middle of a transitional temperate period that will either become much colder (which is normal for the earth) or (which is also normal for the earth).¬†Both of which will impact sea-levels one way or the other. It's not natures fault man built landfills over wetlands (which hasn't been rectified in North America) and¬†killed off a lot of its natural carbon sequestration¬†methods thru¬†clear cutting forests (which is¬†being rectified in North America.) ¬†¬†

#3 doesn't stop¬†USA from exporting its demand¬†for products overseas to India and China (who don't have to go first).¬†In fact it would only continue to encourage offshoring American products and shipping them back to the USA, and then¬†that freight is a carbon emission on top of the carbon emission of it running a cheap coal powered factory somewhere else in the world potentially with child or slave labor. And then even if they agree to it, but their SOI states do not, they will offshore their production to hit their¬†targets as well.¬†It doesn't work if someone goes ""first"" It's all together, or the corporate machine¬†that¬†really rules the world will navigate their way around it¬†like a swarm of locusts.¬†¬†¬†

#4 All the roads to hell were paved with the best of intentions.¬†& I fucking hate legalism, all it really ever does is give someone¬†permission to shoot someone like me because they think the world is overpopulated, or they need breathing room. Maybe they start resettlement programs, maybe they incite civil-wars. Maybe they just¬†debase the currency we trade in by printing more of it to meet all their unfunded commitments.¬†Maybe they'll work it and it will be better, but I'm not a fan of all the collateral damage, top-down change creates. Every holocaust on the planet began with a top-down force of will to get some kind of mission objective done, some kind of trade route open, some kind of parcel under a new deed or title. It's all hocus pocus, a song and dance, that¬†could lead to the very same kind of wars they are¬†in theory,¬†trying to avoid right now. A cultural shift, a market shift, not a revolution, not a political¬†sanction¬†is¬†what is needed to reduce everyone's carbon footprint. ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

#5 ¬†Unpopular or popular, how many Americans actually know the details of what's in this agreement. Buzzwords surrounding the agreement condition them to be amiable to it, but I wouldn't be surprised if 9/10 Americans haven't invested their time into read the damn thing, and having strong opinions about contracts you have not read is not¬†only ignorant but¬†potentially dangerous. I'm not even sure if 9 out of 10 representatives have read it, although I imagine more of them have had credible legal briefs on the subject than 9/10 Americans hearing rhetoric and buzz from international politicians and the corporate media. THE USA is supposed to have bottom up government, not top-down government. This is not a Crown-Authority state, this is a republic founded¬†fundamentally founded on a¬†antithetical opposition to such a thing, but we've been mission-creeping the executive branch ever closer into that¬†form of regime, and at some point we are going to decide where to draw the line, and if we draw that line sooner than later, there is a strong possibility that bloodshed can be averted because it will never be legitimized in the first place. ¬†I've¬†read the Paris PDF on it, and to me it reads like the¬†COMECON agreement that lead to WARSAW, and the SOVIET¬†UNION.¬†& the rhetoric surrounding it is also a lot like¬†how the EU started out as a non-binding economic thing, but now wants¬†its own military thing because its economic thing is fucking binding. After this election cycle what's trending or what's polling well is not an argument.¬†Watch what the UN does against the People of the¬†USA after¬†the politicians most effected by Trump's departure, watch what they threaten to do if the man¬†gets reelected... and watch him try to pull a Putin in¬†response. If it's really non-binding no attempt will be made to¬†sanction the US, but watch, if they don't try.¬†Watch that up-coming political theater, and still try to convince me it's ""non-binding"". These assholes wouldn't have bothered¬†spend years of time, and¬†lots of human and financial resources, on putting together a ""non-binding"" agreement. That's a sell-word, a silber-tongued devil, pure and simple, and ""oh well"" is never the response of those offended by critical departures of key members of the deal, not in the whole diplomatic history of mankind. ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

See, when you¬†break down these long multiple article agreements into an equally aggressive counterpoint speak, and pepper it with vulgarity, it's just as effective to turn public¬†sentiment away from it, if that sentiment is based only on buzz, and not knowledge.¬†

Whether it¬†is truly is the way I see it, or the way you see it, is definitely debatable, and that debate should be¬†hammered out¬†by our Congress, and our Judicial branch, and our POTUS all in the public domain.

Firstly, dirty energy sources and plants require much greater amounts of human imput than clean energy sites such as windfarms and hydroelectric dams. Thus choosing dirty energy over clean energy already provides more jobs for people in an ever growing population. Jobs = happy people who are less likely to become homeless or dependent on social programs paid for by taxes collected from those with jobs. Secondly, dirty energy creates a problem. in escence, it causes a necessity for protecting the environment to emerge. As most would know, out of necessity, emerges innovation. As people try to find new ways to replace dirty energy, or just clean it up, they make incredible advancements that might lead someday to the perfection of energy gathering. Also, since cleaning up is necessary as a result of dirty energy, people get put to work yet again so that they can save the planet while providing for their families. Dirty energy is good for keeping an economy alive, and good for the sake of human advancement.

You can't actually trap all the carbon dioxide, some technology exists but the coal burners don't give a F. There have been attempts at condensing it using water in the cooling towers but it only moves the problem. We can't conserve the condensed carbon dioxide in the ground for reasonable costs nor are the methods reliable enough since it hasn't actually been empirically proven using scientific methods, still too many unknowns. If you want to use ""clean coal"" then you pretty much need to spread the carbon dioxide through a thick lush forest and we all know that the coal burning companies don't want to do that.

Second, liquid thorium salt reactors use throium which is almost free since it's a biproduct piling up everywhere and is considered to be a waste product which is perfectly safe to work with (there are essentially large hills of it all around the world outside rare earth mineral mines). The reaction is initiated by the current waste but once you've done that, you've bootstrapped the supply and current generation waste isn't required.

Third, the waste produced is very toxic (just like current tech) but it produces MUCH less waste and the waste becomes safe in a fraction of the time that the current waste produced by uranium 235 based reactors.

Fourth, we don't actually know where thorium will take us so just leaning on coal and ignoring solar and wind in the mean time is a VERY bad idea. On paper, thorium looks very promising but we can't just sit back and wait. We have to do something NOW! We still need solar and wind power, even if thorium will be able to fulfill all its promises. Power plants always need a secondary and tertiary power supply in case its own power production fails. I would rather see wind and solar connected to batteries than large diesel generators. Modern solar and wind power can be a liberating thing where you don't actually need to be connected to the grid. Since we don't know what prices will look like if throium comes and save us, it's still dumb to just lean back and wait.

The solution is to pursue the goal on multiple fronts and try to outperform all predictions. Power generation is just one of multiple problems that we need to tackle this very moment. Just waiting things out is the most foolish form of complacency there is and trying to be pragmatic about it will only make you look like a fool.

We need to pursue everything we possibly can so we can:
- Wind
- Solar
- Thorium (MSR), very promising, needs more funding in Europe and North America.
- Fusion (don't stop researching this)
- Increase power effeciency (better transformers, electronics, motors)
- Improve batteries (this will always be needed for a multitude of reasons)
- Alternatives to plastics
- Alternatives petroleum and mineral based oils
- Stop using all forms of fossil fuels
- Less pollution on all fronts (all waste we produce should be possible to recycle or transform)

If we can solve the power problem then recycling will become much cheaper and the more reliable production of power in abundance we have, the more we can do to significantly reduce our impact on nature. What ever technology or which combination of technology we use, as long as it's safe, clean and cheap then it's good. Clean coal is an intermediate step and something we need to work past ASAP. Solar, wind and batteries alone can help us but we can't lean on it and just waiting for the right time is idiotic, we need to progress NOW! We will always have industry that uses enormous amounts of power such as production and recycling of metals.

If we all come togther and produce an abundance of electricity, we will be able to solve the problems in poor countries and they don't need to bootstrap themselves into the modern society with dirty technology. We will be able to give them the electricity they need to get clean water, get clean large scale farms, recycling etc.

""not consuming any propaganda""
Everyone is consuming propaganda, even me, even the people who claim they aren't consuming propaganda.  It is kind of unavoidable.  What you can try to is be aware of when it is being fed, regardless no matter how hard you try, you will never be aware of all of it, no body can.

With regards to the stored up permafrost thing, I have heard about it before, mostly in that it could have huge consequences but not human extinction level consequences.  Most of what I understand is that there is a lot not known with exactly how much would be released for what conditions.  And even more unknown unknowns that we still must discover.

The only people I know of who proclaim a super run away effect (with claims that we will turn into Venus) are those who commonly use scare tactics and are perfectly ok with sacrificing accuracy for flash headlines and stories.  The idea that Earth could turn into Venus is just a fringe theory that there isn't any evidence for, just a thought experiment for the most part.  But a lot of people like running with fringe theories as science, and some people end up believe the BS is science, while others end up detecting it as BS and end up distrusting ""science"".

The worst case scenario I have seen about permafrost was the hypothetical if all carbon in it was released. In which case CO2 on Earth would rise by a factor of 150% of current levels.  Which sounds scary and all, polar ice caps disappear, Florida floods, places end up with a different long term climate; but this is still far from a ""human extinction level event"".

By far the easiest way to show that it won't cause extinction of all life on Earth would be to show that life existed during far higher co2 levels.  Hence the reason why I asked you what was the CO2 level during the Dinosaurs Era, most modern estimates put it at at least 4 times modern levels, well above the amount of the worst case scenario of the permafrost.",0.0,1.0,,1WKoj-kodBw,

About the permafrost thing, i will fact-check and i will answer you again then (could be a long time).
To my  knowledge, the microbial activity triggered by the melting of permafrost could boost the release of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere resulting in a snowball effect: temperature rises, more permafrost melts, more greenhouse gasses, repeat,  and i understand the scale of this addition could be much more impactfull than what we are emitting as a species.

A future president could simply aim for the same targets that are in the agreement.  The mere fact that you are making this video suggests there is something binding about it.

Your objection to reason number 2 seems to contradict your objection to reason number 1.  Your objection to reason number two seems to be that we are in a type of ""prisoner's dilemma"" situation.  If we ""defect"" and burn more fossil fuels for the energy to produce more product, we would boost our own economy but at a greater cost to the rest of the world because of The CO2 emissions.  But that means that being in the agreement (and taking it in any way seriously) _is_ bad for the economy.

With your objection number 3,  you admit that China and India (and likely several other countries too) are only agreeing to have us reduce our emissions.  The agreement gives those countries a competitive advantage.  No kidding, they are going to agree to it.  And I don't care if they are ""developing"" or ""more industrial.""  Let China agree to reduce its own emissions.  I'm sure plenty of US firms will be happy to supply them with the tools to build wind farms.

But your claim of what seems ""most fair"" for objection number three just doesn't work for me.  If we are all in the same boat, we should all be considered to have the same responsibilities.  And this looks like making excuses because you only want to hold the US and UK bound and turn the US into a third-world economy.

The question of whether the Paris agreement (where all the other nations agree that the US goes back to the stone age) is politically unpopular here is actually a good one.  Yes, yes, I know that the same outlets that said Trump didn't have a snowball's chance in a volcano to win the election also say that the agreement is popular here.  I just have a little trouble with their credibility.  I'm sure that the agreement is popular in the newsroom of the Associated Press.  And from there, the media have a motive to massage the numbers a bit.

Look, I like the idea of renewable energy sources.  I consider resource exhaustion to be a real problem.  I consider man-made global warming to be a bogeyman.  sure there will be a lot of businesses that like the agreement.

If Obama cared so much about it and it was so good he would've put those policies in action but he didn't. Again the future green solution will be discovered much easier if we have LESS regulation because it'll keep companies with their stable profits from CO2 emitting sources while looking into the experimental green solutions.

Reason 2: It's a free market not a fair market. It's the companies decision on how they get rid of the CO2 based on the state regulation and federal regulation. There will always be storms and other natural disasters but that doesn't justify implementing policies that lose jobs and hinder the economy more so then natural disasters. If the Accord was so good why didn't Obama put all of it into action. 

Reason 3: That doesn't justify that China is the 2nd most carbon emitting country out their and there is still a disproportionate demand by the Paris Accord on the US compared to them.

Reason 4: Then why is putting more policies on the companies that help research green solutions good? 

Reason 5: He is catering to his voters who have been put out of business by regulations and taxes.

Why do we never hear about its benefits? (for example: larger cultivable areas).Historically, periods of warming always coincided with a rise in human population which tends to prove that warming was good to us (all of the holocene, the Roman and Medieval warm periods). Besides, there's strong evidence that more CO2 in the atmosphere is highly beneficial to plants. It makes the earth greener. CO2 is now considered a pollutant but it shouldn't. It's not a pollutant. So reason number 2 does not apply which bring us to the argument: ""let the market decide"".

Thank you for understanding this so completely. However it wouldn't cost America $100 billion a year it would cost $100 billion in total. Obama committed $3 billion last year already. 

But again, you are 100% accurate on china and India not having the same regulations implemented immediately although china is a larger polluter than the US and India is the third largest, India is actually given permission to expand coal production while the US curbs production. 

Trump offered to renegotiate, he asked to simply have everyone be in the same playing field. If America is held to a certain standard than so should the other parties involved, right? However no one would renegotiate. There is no reason for America to be in this accord. 

Another precedent being set here is that the countries with an already pre-existing highly regulated (in comparison) energy industry (i.e. The United States) are being ""punished"" or curbed, while countries with highly UN-regulated energy industries (I.e.

This agreement was never about climate change, rather about redistribution of wealth. If you read the bill it actually doesn't make since. If China, the nation that emits double the amount of CO2 than America, and India, which is one the top 5 most emitting nations of CO2, don't have to pay, why should we? Derek said that they are still 'developing' yet the China economy is about to surpass America's. America would have had to pay OTHER poorer nations $100 billion dollars a year and get this, China and India would have acquired some of that since they are considered 'still developing.' It makes no since. If the nations wanted to reduce climate change, then go after the nations that are emitting the most. The reason why Trump said that this was a scam by China is because America is negatively impacted by this agreement, yet China actually benefits from this. America already contributed $3 billion to this agreement, yet India and China,....$0. And America is putting money into green energy. As of May 12, 2017, America contributed $1 billion to the Green Energy Fund, yet China, Russia, and India put $0. 

People might say, ""why is getting rid of coal plants and switching to renewable energy bad?"" Look at what happened to Germany. They got rid of most of their coal plants and made the switch, and now they are on the verge of an energy crisis. Their electricity prices doubled, 800,000 households can no longer afford energy, and the government invested $412 billion dollars for this. According to the US Energy Information Administration, we have 284 years left of coal on reserves. We have time to perfect green energy. Right now, green energy is still in development. It's like mass producing a prototype, and why countries are doing it is beyond me. Thanks to the Department of Energy creating 'clean coal research,' CO2 emissions from coal has declined since 2005 (https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=30712) and thanks to coal scrubbers, 95% of real pollutants such as SO2, are trapped in filters. The trapped SO2 is later combined with limestone to be used in manufacturing cement and drywall (https://www.duke-energy.com/our-company/environment/air-quality/sulfur-dioxide-scrubbers). I mean total CO2 emissions have been declining anyway in US (https://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/carbon/)

1. It must rely on good science about the climate. 

2. It must accurately predict the effects of climate change on standards of living.

3. It must endorse public policies that will do something to mitigate the negative effects of climate change on standards of living. 

4. It must demonstrate that these public policies will in fact mitigate the effects of climate change. 

5. The agreement must demonstrate that the costs of the proposed public policies themselves are lower than the costs of the climate change. 

If the Paris agreement fails to do any of these things, it should be rejected. If the net effect of the agreement is to make people poorer, then the agreement is of no value. 

Now, without making any judgment about climate science itself, we can see just from looking at the Paris agreement that it could easily be rejected on the basis of numbers two, three, four, and five in our list.

After all, the agreement is based on policy predictions that are wildly speculative.They attempt to make predictions about the global economy decades in the future (a notoriously unreliable endeavor) and they fail to honestly take into account the true costs of imposing far-higher energy costs on most of the world's poor and working classes ‚Äî which is what the agreement would do. 

In fact, the agreement doesn't even mention the cost to households that would face higher energy costs under the agreement. The only costs mentioned are the costs of adapting to climate change. In other words, the agreement assumes that there is no downside for households in the agreement's provisions. That's a huge red flag right there. 

Also ignored is the opportunity cost of adopting the agreement's provisions. In real life, adoption of the agreement's policy prescriptions will lessen growth by reducing access to basic energy resources. In addition to reducing household wealth, this will also reduce tax revenues. Money spent on higher energy costs is money that can't be spent elsewhere ‚Äî on things like health care, and research into better agricultural practices. Yet, at the same time, the agreement calls for massive redistribution of wealth and large amounts of government spending on various programs such as ""emergency preparedness"" and more government ""insurance"" to pay for the effects of natural disasters. 

Thus, the agreement calls for more spending, while reducing the ability of both the public and private sectors to engage in that spending. It's a self-defeating endeavor.",0.0,0.0,,1WKoj-kodBw,

Created the problem? He ignores undermine economics and money pulled out of the education system to create new goods. SO we have other issues around the problem. 

Research Samsung... mimicry is one thing ,but the way its setup cannot exist as it does. especially when many other forms of uses are undermined and other uses are stolen or mislead, and then scarcity made by those controlling natural resource productions. SO there is a very snake world involved. A smaller populace having fun... is considered, greedy, murder,liars, bandits, evil and other nonsense. 30% of the worlds emissions from America... Hmm... It just seems way off, I suppose if China has 300 million people and produced the same amount of co2 it would be 75%. There is some strange stats around co2 measurement and correlated data of actual co2 emissions. Not all emissions are terrible. So there isa large misleading aspect of: even using cattle and other forms as a production of waste, even a compost can have co2 emissions quantified to it. Even walking and breathing can then even be isolated to having emissions. So there is some very sketchy stats you through out there. 

I think the classic method of , respecting ones items and replacing them and sewing them worked fine, before. Asiatic exploitation hubs, and pr campaigns undermined the economics and stole informations and now its today, labeling us with bullshit stats of largest emitter of emissions. There was direct social use and pressures to force people to even accept and purchase engineered obsolesce products. Walmart vars that owed expire to the day after the warranty. Myth or no myth I have had my personal encounter solidified and many others, with products failing months after the 2 year warranty. Most of them could be fixed with some simple knowing of electronics, such as weld tacking of a new capacitor, but these types of hardware stores have disappeared, even constructing and buying base model parts at stores for fun, are all mass shipped to exploitation trade hubs for individual profits, including take over of public works into private hands. Yeah.. I think you are so far out of reality... of the present war actions of the earth. War is not just bang bang, its economic and other means of manipulation and ideaological change. So many lies pandered by the outlets meant to serve and use of public reform and teaching, is now th very entity misleading, many to poor choices. all for profits of nothing.

Instead people are forced to constantly buy sub products because inflation drives down the natural wage of fairness os we cannot afford to build, maintain our own infrastructure and rates of pay for a collective few that are establishing a rule of nonsense of the civilization. This tax of inflation is greater damage the the forced income tax, in which was once utilized so magnificently. Now its tool for pandering idiots, and youtube promoters in which consider patreaon(crowd funding) the same as classic patreons like those that employed Da vinci. So we have this great harlot of media-ocre types of persona using influence to drive confusion, I give benefit of the doubt that they themselves may be confused; but in reality often these people say and make accusations or statements without evidence or enough research into their research of evidence to make bias opinions and poor judgements thus not having accurate information to disseminate proper information. 

He's missing the Al Jeezra statements of the 80's Empire club of the 90's statements of prince Philip, and some of his comments, and including Saudi's wanting a 3rd war. its greed driving the planet, but more so misleading and exposing people to harm. To want an item is not greed. To command its production and reap all the profits is greed, especially through exploitation. To be rich ,by donation itself is not greed, but to pander lie to get those donations is a lie, which is greed, or the escapism of today that is so rampant, in which people are ignoring and avoiding works and creating a modern day world of monetary slavery on money. Wages are one thing when in a non inflated market. 

Then there is the over value of opals and gems, and diamonds gold created by monopolies. Which is another sickening thing. Since r and D out of Japan has shown that we can create nearly every precious stone and gem for pennies. Just as bad as the selenite lamp s or the crystal itself which is dollars per kg sold for 100 per kg. its a mad world. Emissions or profits and correlation does not hold current proper values as their a misguided sums created by fiat or fiction. The real world numbers are the actions, implementations and uses recovery and geo engineering and many other products and applications. Since this largely ignored for what I call bait politics. In which all they do every day, is throw around billion dollar words and million dollars and just drive confusion even more. 

The only relative data is present data, not past data, unless its defined constant, in meaning it cannot change. Thus past cleanses itself and holds no vengeance, however living entity is a present force in which has application, can become fallen to the data inputed or held captive and hated simply by the means of capital abuse of those seeking nothing but profit. The current social meta of society is extremely lucrative for predatory businesses. 

Again you ignore the laws and deregulations and the interim wars by other groups like Russia, Lenism, Feminism groups and more. 70' 's gambling in Canada was illegal. Cause and affect relations of regulatory body is to stop and remove all forces that are detriment to the health and well being of the community. These laws have bene for centuries removed, and the people attempting to uphold them, killed in the process of those that follow the madness of roseau. People that care, make laws to protect the children...
Regardless eventually all the descendants of the liars will equals out in their own nonsense of abuses, and realize they are destroying themselves and children, hey but some love to kill all people including their own daughters nan sons. 

The accord.. It is a meaningless document if, imo. China is not held to the same standard, because  would rather murder any and all eastern influence and its destruction its waged economically if it continued to go this way of deception and lies. call me hater, but its not the people its the leadership and the politics of the land and the breaking of law. Nonetheless a feeling is not somethgin to make arash judgement on.

If CHINa expects us to continue trading and not be held to the same regard, in which we must have their stamped products. Then no the accord is useless. They are a military and war mongering nation, all the asiatics share if you do your present day research no need for modern day research, under the philosophy in their realm of ""art of war"" which is outtake advantage of kindness. Which is the philosophy of their leadership and direction of its people and serves them well. Meiji empire. Japan. Korea.(samsung) China, Vietnam, etc. etc... We have to be subjugated to their migration of the third wolrd with direct influence in criminal gang forming and data of larger and larger criminal behaviour.  The Pr of the constant is that the first will be last, and it would seem that way, they are simply forced out of house and home for war philophsies and abuses. even more so the language used is satan must free ""himself"" by giving us all knowledge or we all die attitude is like the most weird self killing language use of self ruin. SO its like a hijacker on the planet saying, give us all your life, and or you all die, and will will commit. I think you are outside the box of reality. Words mean nothing its the deception for the masses to follow. 
Just follow the actions and works and thus find out the intent by examining the case and affect to its relation and thus you see whether or not which holds true. Not of what one writes as it would seem dishonesty is apparently the like of today.

If your going to use British columbia as an examplein which hong Kovouver exists, and thieves and monetary abuses and savage upheaval of life and the direct violation nan destruction that the asaitics have had aggressive economic and exploiting the cline resource nodes, I would say you a pice of shit.

But now the asylum is in an uproar because a lot of people liked the delusion that they could control the climate if only everybody (especially all the white male Americans) stopped breathing.

""Nicaragua because they didn't think it went far enough""... actually because they wanted a bigger bribe from the developed nations (USA) to stop their polluting.

""It's bad for the US economy."" Of course it is. Barack Obama was issuing executive orders that practically shut down the coal industry in an attempt to implement the target, along with a lot of other draconian regulations of other industries. And in many cases those same regulations did nothing for the environment because the regulations only caused the companies to shut down their US operations and move overseas to some location like China with less restrictive policies. If what we're concerned about is a global problem, it does no good to play whack-a-mole. 

""Let the free markets decide."" Stopping the insane regulations does not in any way impede innovation in green technologies. Americans are not going to stop favoring green energy and green products tomorrow just because the federal government withdrew from the Paris Climate Accord. We will still achieve reductions, but voluntarily, not mandated from WDC in ways that throw people unnecessarily out of work. To be fair, CO2 isn't a pollutant at all. It's what plants breathe and they would be healthier if there was more CO2 in the atmosphere, and that would lead to more food production. But you knew that from grade school science. Did you forget? But if people are persuaded that more atmospheric CO2 is harmful for whatever irrational reason the IPCC comes up with next, then they will, in a free market, favor products that minimize their CO2 emissions, all else being equal. They may even pay a premium for such products based upon their perceived ""saving the world"" and ""guiltless pleasure"" and ""virtue signalling"" values. They may even voluntarily contribute to mitigation efforts such as planting trees and paying Brazilians to guard the rain forests rather than cutting them down. The market is a more robust mechanism than you make it out to be.

""China and India don't have to reduce their emissions."" The Paris Climate Accord is grossly unfair because some of the biggest polluters can continue to pollute, even increase their pollution, until the year 2030, but not the USA. Europe, as well, volunteered to cut their emissions much less drastically than the USA. China and India want to increase their GDP, but so does the USA. Why should the Paris Climate Accord favor GDP growth in countries that have laxer environmental regulations than the USA? It shouldn't. That's the whack-a-mole problem again. Companies will move their operations to whatever country regulates them the least in order to reduce their costs the most. Some of them won't stop polluting until there is no other alternative. Also, it's not true that an underdeveloped country doesn't contribute much to the problem. Burning of wood/coal/dung fires is horribly polluting, especially when done in a country with a huge population. It's crucially important that pollution is regulated in large, densely populated countries, whereas small, lightly populated countries contribute little to any global problem, and their efforts, even if draconian, result in immeasurable abatement. 

""It wouldn't help climate change anyway."" Projections are that even if all countries did as pledged under the Paris Climate Accord, and assuming that the IPCC climate models are correct (which is not at all true), the global temperature would drop a grand total of .2 degrees Celsius by 2100. That's right, not a single degree of difference in global temperature over an 83 year period. That's well within the margin of error of such measurements, by the way. Statistically then, it buys us nothing. Since it buys us nothing, nothing is lost by withdrawing from the agreement and allowing the free market to work its will.

""It's politically unpopular."" So be it. It doesn't really matter what the general electorate thinks. Most people have no idea what the Paris Climate Accord does, whether they are for it or not. They've been told that CO2 is bad, the Paris Climate Accord is going to save us from whatever apocalypse the IPCC is pushing this year, and so they're blindly for it. After all, you don't want polar bears to die and cities to flood, do you? Nobody ever bothers to say that the sea level has been rising steadily ever since the last ice age at the rate of one inch every 7.5 years, and that pace has not increased since industrialization.

""To piss off the opposition."" The opposition was already pissed off far beyond any level of rational discourse. We're now at a level of irrational discourse characterized by a humorless person posing as an ISIS executioner holding the severed, bloody head of the president by the hair. President Trump campaigned on getting us out from under the obligations of the Paris Climate Accord, and, rare for a politician, he does his very best to keep his campaign promises. He also believes in the rule of law and upholding the constitution. Since the Paris Climate Accord was never offered to the Senate for ratification it is legally null and void in the USA. It is best not to let such a dangerous precedent stand.",0.0,0.0,,1WKoj-kodBw,

The information is there, all you have to do is access it. There is no thinking or pondering necessary. This is not a subjective topic, what is irrelevant is your sole opinion based on a gut feeling. ""

Mike, it's not my personal opinion that humans have no impact on global warming (it's the opposite) but that is the viewpoint of some people who believe in global warming but won't choose clean energy alternatives.

Again, this is not solely subjective. Pew research center is a respected research center. 

"" As prior mentioned, people are supporting green policies of all different kinds in multiple states. This enforces the idea that we want a healthier environment. ""

Everybody wants an healthier environment, but not everybody wants to choose it at the expense of other things. Far as i can see, most of these people are situated in the inlands.

"" Hard to say unless I watched the documentary but a large amount of documentaries do this nonetheless, so I feel the probability is high. ""

Plenty of x do x, therefore probability is high. Plenty of documentaries also don't do that, so what is your objective assesment of probability? Are you going to watch all documentaries and count together the total sum? what criterion are you using besides you just ""feeling"" that the probability is high?

No offense, but it seems that you are opposed to the picture a particular documentary paints and therefore assumes that it must be deception by the creators.

"" The hardest thing to do is correctly depict the thoughts inside the heads of a countries population. Many times we just estimate it through a relatively small sample. Therefore any conclusion strictly based on this method has much room for skepticism. Do you disagree? besides, I just checked my old universities database and pews percentages conflict with its separate social study. I feel like this serves to only further my point. I feel like the actions of people's votes speak louder than one study. ""

Pew research are very upfront about the statistical margin for error for once,  they have handled investigation of massive sample sizes, and they do go from state to state.

Scepticism is always warranted, but they are not a shady company by any stretch.

I Linked you dozens upon dozens of studies. You'll have to be specific which one you find is in conflict, and you'll have to check if they are asking the same questions, list their results the same, and have a similar kind of sample size.

You'll also find that the pew research agrees with you. Most americans do want a healthy and sustainable enviroment. But certain political demographics, which just so happens to be in the inland states which also just so happens to be far behind the coasts on climate-smart politics and Co2 emissions, the answers would fluctuate when the question became more nuanced.",0.0,1.0,,1WKoj-kodBw,

""I think that human impact on global warming is minuscule or non-existent""


There's countless research on the subject, instead of relying on blogs and documentaries for your information, go to reliable sources. The information is there, all you have to do is access it. There is no thinking or pondering necessary. This is not a subjective topic, what is irrelevant is your sole opinion based on a gut feeling. 


As prior mentioned, people are supporting green policies of all different kinds in multiple states. This enforces the idea that we want a healthier environment. 


""It might be what you say, but then again it might not""


Hard to say unless I watched the documentary but a large amount of documentaries do this nonetheless, so I feel the probability is high. 


""Right now you are dismissing the pew research for no other reason than you don't like the conclusion""


 The hardest thing to do is correctly depict the thoughts inside the heads of a countries population. Many times we just estimate it through a relatively small sample. Therefore any conclusion strictly based on this method has much room for skepticism. Do you disagree? besides, I just checked my old universities database and pews percentages conflict with its separate social study. I feel like this serves to only further my point. I feel like the actions of people's votes speak louder than one study. 

Nevertheless, I'll admit I was wrong about pew not providing their actual research. I looked around for it but must've missed the PDF link.

Hardly relevant. If you posed the question to them like that, everyone would say yes. But if you asked them if they wanted to sacrifice their coal-based production which earn them their income, the answers would fluctuate a bit more. I think it's important to look at the range of answer given. Some people do believe in global warming, but think that human impact on global warming is miniscule or non-existent. Others know that global warming is affected by humans, but feel that it does not matter because they are personally not affected.

That's great.

And i am sure that plenty of people support the idea of green energy. However, the question was, will they choose it?

When the government asks you if you want your tax money to go towards green energy projects, will you choose it? When you have to choose between long-term bio fuel investment by getting rid of the Co2-based fuels you allready have and which provides you with income, will you choose it? Will you want the industry, public transport etc... to change, with all costs that are associated with such a process?

We can easily invest in more efficient technologies without being part of the Paris accord and to top it off, also since countries like China are not bound to uphold their part then GUESS what, They won't. This whole plan is practically virtue signaling while making the US starve itself in the process. No it's not fair that centuries of innovation aloud the US to ahead should be punished by this either, the deal is clearly one sided as evident by the fact that the accord will not be renegotiated, now if the EU were to actually care about the environment, wouldn't they want to remake the deal so the US can still ""help"". Nope, because they wanted the money and guess what, what happens of say a country like France completely destabilizes, they back out of their part of the deal meaning or for other reason like they decide one day to implement more into something else entirely, they will most likely lower their contributions to the accord. This deal does not help in anyway to truly stop any climate change. ""But all countries unit together "" to address the problem and makes it easier to solve. No, you want to know what happens when you unite as one team, innovation stops and the main contributors are forced to take over, you think fucking Luxembourg is going to help once the US joins,no eventually their part will fall into obscurity and once more the main economic countries will  have to compensate and completely take over. Now referring to your part about the EU and the US being the main polluters , i swear I heard somewhere that China is in fact number 1. 

The main reason besides the economic one: the Paris accord is ineffective and I know You said it was a floor rather than a solution well, then that is plan and simple the main reason not to join, I will gladly join a plan that has the solution and not something that offers you nothing but a floor, why buy a house with only a floor when you can get another one with the entire building, and besides a united effort by all governments is not going to do anything, if anything it will be some scientist late at night who has been working on some purifying machine who finally after months of work and sleepless nights, finally finds a way of somehow clearing CO2 from the environment as well as many other harmful particles.

Your first point where you say why its not bad for the economy you seem to forget that at the current point green tech is at, you would end up increasing the cost of energy for everyone by a substantial margin, also you can invest in better ways to produce energy without trying to replace every coal mine with a solar field and wait until you have good enough renewable energy sources that its not just going to cause another bunch of issues. 

Second point about free markets is alright, but a carbon tax as it is often proposed is a bad idea simply because it would be massively confusing and ultimately just increase the costs of everything as the companies that do the polluting aren't going to foot the bill, we are, in increased prices on everything and taxes to run the bureaucracies that police it. Also CO2 emissions are different from pumping shit into rivers that kills fish and makes people unable to swim in the river, it doesn't really cause any problems for the local area, just on a macro scale with everyone doing it, it might influence weather in some way, to me this doesn't seem comparable to companies pumping so much shit into the air that it rains acid.

China and India do have targets but those targets are apparently what would happen regardless with the slowing of their economies and they already have what they need, so its not so much a target as it is just naturally tapering off compared to their massive growth, in other words they would have to purposefully create more than they need for no real benefit to not achieve their goal. Also India is trying to use CO2 emissions to essentially blackmail other nations into giving them billions of dollars or they wont try to slow down. 

Then you say that the fact that hypothetically if the agreement was carried out to the letter it has to been shown to basically have no effect on climate change, and this isn't a bad reason to ditch it because it's a start? I would say its a start in the wrong direction. Why not just encourage governments or get a lot of funding for research into renewable clean energy, you would save a lot of time in trying to make all these confusing limiting rules that nobody has to follow and people don't want to follow and just spend money looking into new technologies or making the current ones more efficient. Always attaching shitloads of rules and regulations to researching green energy just stops the research of green energy, these two things need to be separated, always attaching research to reducing industry just stops research. Basically stop making research reliant on a whole bunch of other issues, I'm sure if the Paris Climate Agreement just encouraged countries to spend more on green energy research and facilitated scientific co-operation cross nations there wouldn't be such an issue.",0.0,0.0,,1WKoj-kodBw,

1. The Carbon Tax will increase the price of various products which will cause some people who depend on those products can't function.

Also how can you tax the weather? I would very much like to see how that can be accomplished.

2. The Free Market has shown time and time again that it is more cost effective and efficient than government programs. So, yes, the Free Market will be able to handle it. Also CO2 isn't a pollutant and even if it were then there is a natural mechanism to correct any excess like PHOTOSYNTHESIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

3. Also the Carbon emissions from America and Europe have been going down since 2000. India and China have to deal with pollutants that cause smog. CO2 is not one of the components of smog. If so then why don't the Chinese just have parks scattered throughout their cities?

4. The Paris Climate Scam won't help the climate. The IPCC guesses that the most the Paris agreement can do is slow it down over the next hundred years or so. The Honda Accord is more effective and efficient than the PCA.

2. Government run programs and privately run companies have similar management. The governments responsibility here is to push the energy sector into renewable energy sources because the price of the externality isn't accounted for in the price of the commodity. CO2 is a pollutant and photosynthesis only works during the day. Plants inhale oxygen and exhale co2. Plants take in a lot more co2 than they release, by a ratio of about 10:1.

_Ideally, we as a species need to keep the Earth from warming 2 degrees Celsius for now._

You know, it's amazing to me that you think we could actually control the climate for the whole planet, or that it would even be worth trying. It's been said that we may have already passing a so-called ""tipping point"". That even if we stopped all CO2 production, than the temperature would still continue to rise for the next 100 years. It might all be speculation, but the point is, I don't think we have nearly the influence on climate that you seem to think we do. 

Also, you never answered my previous question about the ideal temperature. Who's to say that a 2 degree increase in temperature might not be better than it is now? Especially, if it took 100 years or more to increase it and that's assuming it even goes that high, which is not a given. 

First of all, humans are not biggest influence on climate. Forces like the Ocean, the Sun, forests all have just as much if not far larger influence on climate than we do. 

You claim we've had dramatic increase in temperature. From what I could I find, some claim the temperature has increased 0.8 C in the last 100 years or so. Well, I don't have all the facts available to me, but I would question some of that increase may be because of questionable temperature taking and also El Nino, which might skew the results. 

_Humans have greatly interrupted the carbon cycle, The rate of climate change has been increasing abnormally_

Where is the evidence for this, I think you are just wildly speculating. You seem to think humans are some great evil force, but I would suggest otherwise. 

There is not enough conclusive evidence to suggest humans are the main cause for whatever temperature change there has been. You may not believe me, but you have to realize that climate is incredibly dynamic. We don't in fact, fully understand how it works. Climate is chaotic, and much of the time is unpredictable. Think of a butterfly flapping its wing and causing a hurricane in China. It would be the height of hubris to claim one knows what caused some climate event with 100% certainty. 

You have nothing to be ashamed of or sorry for if your a human. By trying to control climate, you will only hurt humanity because you'll be depriving them of cheap, affordable and plentiful energy.

And basic chemistry and science tells us that oxygen allows less sunlight into the atmosphere, and carbon dioxide allows larger amounts of sunlight and heat to pass through. With all of the fossil fuels and carbon products being burned, a lot of CO2 is being released into the atmosphere, and do you know what that means? It means that the planet is warming at an natural rate. The problem is the rate that CO2 is being released at, because the Earth cannot absorb it fast enough (either through plants, the oceans, etc.) causing a significant increase in temperatures. You are right, Earth's climate has changed rapidly like this before but its different this time. The CO2 is not being naturally absorbed at a healthy rate, it is staying up there for far too long and its not being absorbed again. The rate is unnatural, because in the past 40 years the climate has been warming dramatically, basic science and 97% of scientists tell us so. And yes, some of the climate change that is occurring is not man made, but that is perfectly natural. However, the VASS majority of it is caused by humans, and we as a species need to take responsibility for our actions. When the volcano Krakatoa erupted in 1883, it's ash spread all over the Earth, causing it to be deemed ""The Year without a Summer"" because the ash kept out the warming rays of the sun. However, the Earth was able to recover from this event after about a year and absorb all of the ash again because there was no highly unnatural force interrupting the carbon cycle. It is different now. Humans have greatly interrupted the carbon cycle, with deforestation,  wildfires, (although sometimes wildfires can be a good thing) polluting, making the oceans more acidic, etc. All of this makes it much harder for all of this carbon to be absorbed again, causing the intensity of climate change to increase, and the rate of it too. The rate of climate change has been increasing abnormally, and this is unnatural because normally it would go back down through the process of the carbon cycle but it is not because of us.

Let me ask you some questions: What is the ideal temperature for the planet? What is the ideal rate of climate change? Hint: There is no such thing, it would just be a opinion. 

Perhaps some of our climate change is man-made, but that doesn't mean that it's rate is unnatural. If you take a look at history, there is nothing abnormal at all about the rate of temperature change. There have been times in ancient history where temperatures went up rapidly and they went down rapidly. All this occurred even when there were no humans.

And to respond to Zoe,
Your links don't prove that co2 doesn't cause warming; they only repeat the well-known since the early 1900s fact that the greenhouse effect does not work the same way as it does for a physical greenhouse. It's basic physics that even contrarians like Roy Spencer acknowledge; they simply reject that humans are doing enough.
And your graphs you link are manipulated. It's easy to see that they aren't labeled. They show INTEGRATED sunspot levels, which are always increasing. Yet sometimes it's decreasing- meaning they add a linear factor to it (as is often needed), but never explain why. They likely just picked the best one.
Your abstract you link shows sun activity going back before 1900- before humans were emitting co2. I'd go on to see which data sets they used and if they really mean integrated sun activity but it's a paid paper and I can only read the abstract.

2). You are stuck where a lot of ""scientist"" get stuck. You are looking at a very, very small picture of the entirety of the worlds history to justify this argument. When you look at the WHOLE history of the worlds CO2 to temperature ratio, you realize that everything we do is pretty insignificant. There is no proof about intense storms. The worlds weather (or climate) is and has always changed. Again, look at ALL the information. Look at the Dinosaur fossils. Look at the grand canyon. Climate change! So no, the cost is so insignificant that it doesn't matter. Kinda like when walmart rounds the percentages of pennies.

3). China STILL DEVELOPING! They own everyones debt. how are they still ""developing"". This argument is stupid. Trump is 100% correct! Wouldn't you want a country to develop clean. How about this. Instead of your city cleaning your water, they are just going to pump it from the Nile river to your house, you know, because your house hasn't finished being built.

When you finished making a house of sticks, you can move on to solid wood, then after you finished building it with wood, then you get to use the new technology we had.

Because we might miss out on investment opportunities? Really?  Sounds like we are doing just fine without an ""agreement"".

2.  The market is what it will always be, supply and demand.  When solar panels and wind turbines are cheaper than coal and oil, you'll be happy.

3.  The truth is China is #1 by a long shot %28.21 as of 2016 (going by current numbers, not an overall number like you did to put US on top).  China is neck and neck with our economy and has ample income to check emissions, if they were so inclined.  It is very naive to think China will put any money into curbing emissions (or India for that matter).  It would be a safe bet that if there were actual actionable restrictions placed to make China reduce emissions, they would be right behind the US in leaving.

4.  When there are actionable methods in place, then an agreement should be instituted as in the Montreal Protocol with products that damaged the ozone.  There is no common sense in sending pledge money to talking heads because, well, it makes us feel better.

5.  Yes.  President Trump made a campaign pledge to get us out of this ""agreement"", and he made good with that promise.  He is not moved by the ""oppositions"" emotional outcries.

#2 CO2 does not trap infrared light. In fact, CO2 is much heavier than oxygen so the higher in elevation that is measured the less CO2 there is, just like oxygen, but CO2 is heavier than oxygen so it hugs the ground. Near the ground it has no greenhouse effect.
Why penalize energy usage when you can penalize those who destroy the environment that have natural organisms that reduce the CO2? Stop cutting down trees and replace all products that require a tree to be cut down with hemp instead. It's fiber breaks down with water, produces more pulp per acre than trees, and takes 4 months to mature, unlike trees that take 15-40 years. And get this, one acre of hemp removes 3 times more CO2 from the air than 1 acre of trees. So you want to reduce CO2 in the air then plant trees and grow hemp. The reason why CO2 levels increase every year is because the plankton in the oceans is dwindling and people are clear cutting 7 millions hectares of trees down. You want to make a difference then take action against deforestation and polluting our oceans, not against those who use energy. And if you want renewable energy then simply drill a 6"" diameter pipe into the ground about 9,000 ft. deep. You will get a continuous flow of air at 120¬∞ F if a center pipe is inserted as a cold air supply.

Other countries will be able to see our changes and can copy our work, be it out of agreement, rivalry, or out of a drive to improve it.

8) Right, but I'm sure you'd agree there is an inverse  correlation  between renewable clean energy and environmental cleanup costs. Also once again, every dollar spent on pushing technology to solve problems is a dollar spent on new discoveries that can be put to use bettering everyone as a whole.

In any case, it's going to close loop back into fiscal funds. Energy installations themselves can be shifted to power any other economic activity. Heavy investments in clean energy for mining activities happened in Chile since 2011, and when the prices of commodities went down, the electrical capacity worked as a cushion and kept providing work and income to the people from mining regions. With lowered local demand, energy was exported abroad or to other activities.

Thinking that if something is not the reaching the goal, then it should be forgotten altogether. This ignores that it's still a step towards it, and even if the end goal is not completely solved, using an imperfect method to try to solve the issue is better than nothing at all. Saying ""screw it"" to the Paris Agreement because it's merely postponing the issue of global warming is very short-sighted. If we keep working at it, we can postpone it for even later, until it's postponed for 20 years later, 100, 500, and infinity, to never happen realistically. Global warming is already a reality, what we can do is try to prevent it from getting to the worst. It is important is that we keep factoring this goal in our decisions. And that's what the Paris Agreement tries to do. 

7: No it's not self-explanatory. I assume you see the prisoner dilemma as a justification to act selfishly even though it's a worse outcome. In concrete terms, that it's better to be the one to pollute for free and expect the others to be kind and do the clean thing, which results in everybody polluting. But that's the situation now, without collaboration. And guess what international agreements are for; agreeing to collaborate and avoid the worst for everyone. It's exactly to counter the dilemma's negative effects. 

8: Zero-sum game fallacy. Thinking that with limited resources like money, the only thing that matters is where we choose to allocate it or not, in a binary way. While money management make it seems like a limited resource, using it for one thing is not denying it for others causes. Basic business talk: good investments create more value than the money spent. Especially when it comes to environment issues, which are so tightly linked together, some investment in one area does have repercussions on others. Efforts on containing dumping will affect surrounding land quality, and support the ecosystem to regenerate.

9: This is misunderstanding the Paris Agreement. And to some extent, all recent environmental-focused actions. It's not about ""do less of that polluting stuff"", although it's welcome, most people know that's not the most efficient. Innovation is key to solve our problem, and it's best if it can be introduced in a systemic way, so lifestyle changes are minor, or felt as improvements.

A few foot ball fields will be enough, and it's not waste; it's highly valuable material that only an irrational imbecile  would be trying to get rid off. Platinum group elements, a smorgasboard of useful radioactive isotopes. TRU wastes that morons are worried about are fuel.

There's a few Coal-Chernobyls every week and nobody cares, that tells me everything I need to know about the opposition to nuclear power. If radiophobes were rational they'd draw 1000 mile circles around every coal plant and demand they be evacuated.

The evacuation of Fukushima was not driven by rational health concerns. It was driven by radiophobia. Radiation doses so small that it's impossible to demonstrate that they cause cancer (because radiation is a piss-weak carcinogen) was used to justify moving people; which *always* causes many deaths. *You* have blood on your hands for Fukushima, not me.

Fukushima demonstrates rather conclusively the safety of nuclear power. The greatest credible damage to a nuclear plant in reasonable countries (that would never have licensed anything like the RBMK) and nobody died from radiation and there will be no demonstrable long term health consequences; just the usual FUD from radiophobic morons. 

""Is there a reason why no new nuclear power plants have been permitted to be built in the USA in the last 21 years? ""

Look in a mirror. I can make solar power infinitely expensive. It's easy. Require solar PV to pay for the unreliability that causes extra costs on the grid. Require solar PV to pay for grid upgrades needed to shuffle electricity from anywhere to anywhere, which is required for large scale, non-fossil backed adoption. Require solar PV to pay for grid storage it needs in order to not burn dangerous fossil gas as backup. Litigate against any attempt to build photovoltaics, manufacturing plants or storage plants. Get a massive solar farm cancelled after they've been built and are about to be decomissioned because of desert grashoppers or some other phony excuse. Try to trump up as much political turbulence as possible so no major solar farm invester can ever know if their investment will be allowed to operate. Ban importation of cheap chinese photovoltaics, which genuinely are an environmental disaster (silicon trichloride dumped in the nearest river because it's cheaper; no control over how much super-greenhouse gases like nitrogen trifluoride leak). A complete ban on arsenic and cadmium containing solar cells and a demand that all cadmium and arsenic be extracted from said thin film cells and stored underground forever (half-life infinite). A demand that solar panel installers working with photovoltaics on roofs be specially certified, wear extreme protection against falling accidents that require eye-bolts every 2 feet on your roof and require surrounding the entire house with a giant continuous trampoline in case of falls. Require home owners to prove that they can turn the electricity off in case of fire so that firefighters cannot get electrocuted; require homeowners to prove that in case of fire, solar panels won't by some magical mechanics be turned into finely ground dust, drift to the nearest festival grounds or football arena on a busy day and be inhaled; you also have to do research to show how many people could die and what evacuation radius you should have based on the assumption on a linear, no treshhold model for silicosis. Have someone paid $200/hr by the applicant tediously review these applications on a case by case basis. Require the solar panel operator to continously work to improve the safety of their systems (and solar panels are far more dangerous than nuclear plants; heights kill) spending near infinite amounts of money to chase microdeaths.",2.0,1.0,,1WKoj-kodBw,

Nuclear is safe and recent nuclear energy crises really weren't as bad as people think. Chernobyl was workers ""testing"" emergency backups and causing disaster due to their inexperience. Fukushima truly wasn't as bad as people believe and the current levels of background radiation in many areas around Fukushima are lower than an average day in Denver. Not to mention, the earthquakes that caused the tsunami that caused the Fukushima disaster killed thousands of people - Fukushima was a miniscule event on that scale. Nuclear waste is unimaginably small compared to how much energy is produced by nuclear reactors and France has never had a problem with it.
However, as Kevin pointed out, nuclear is prohibitively expensive. Reactor lifetimes can be extended to around 60 years with some expensive maintenance after 30-40 years while wind turbines and solar panels usually peter out around 20 years (and solar has degredation effects). Factoring in lifetime maintenance and initial cost, wind (especially offshore) and high efficiency solar are typically cheaper per kWh than nuclear, and if I remember correctly, hydroelectric tended to be about the same as nuclear.",0.0,1.0,,1WKoj-kodBw,

We for example have short summers and while people say that 20 hour long days more than cover for the dark winters they are not taking into account that in the worst case scenarios out of those long summer days 20 might be clear where the others are rainy and/or cloudy, which means that solar panels won't be working with full efficiency.

I'll go through each point one by one.  

1.  First of all, as you say in the video, the policy is non-binding.  What is the point of it then, if it can't do anything?  If it's non-binding, then the only thing he is doing by leaving the agreement is taking the stance that the U.S. Federal Government will not try to force CO2 emissions to go down, create more environmental regulations, etc.  Renewable resources are also just flat-out more expensive, with an estimated cost of 13%-20% higher than non-renewables.  If renewable resources were cheaper than non-renewables, than Trump would obviously be all for it,  citing the private sector job growth and global innovation all around that it could cause.  But it currently is not cheaper, which leads me to the next point

2. It hurts the poor, and by a lot.  There are billions of people on Earth that struggle to have the necessary energy they need to get through the day.  Coal and oil are the only ways they can have any source of electrical power at all because it is cheap.  If prices for those go up and they are forced to pay more money for them or if more expensive renewables are their only option, they would not be able to afford it.  Hundreds of thousands of people would die each year just by the inability to acquire energy because it is so expensive.  For rich countries like the US or Canada, that's not a problem, it's just more gas money or a higher electricity bill.  The British Columbia example is a clear sign of that, more expensive energy is a nuisance but not the worst thing in the world in affluent areas.  However, for the world's poorest, it's the difference between living or dying. 

3.  The free market.  According to the Department of Energy, the US lost over 2.2 billion dollars in loans given out to environmental companies.  The fact of the matter is that the government is inefficient, and loses money.  The free market, on the other hand, always goes to the most efficient thing, which is currently nonrenewable resources.  However, as you said yourself, 7 in 10 Americans support the Paris Agreement and more importantly renewable resources.  Once private sector development of environmentally friendly renewable resources creates energy cheaper than current nonrenewables, then, of course, Trump and anyone with a brain would support it because it would bring cheaper and easier success in practically every field, and help out the world's poorest who survive on the most economical of energy choices.  The free market, not the world's government will be the catalyst, though, and that's what Trump's trying to do.  

4.  China.  Currently, China produces over twice the amount of CO2 than America, and almost 30% of all the CO2 emitted on Earth.  Although the US does have higher per capita emissions, it still doesn't take away the fact that we're letting them off the hook just because they're ""developing.""  Is that saying the US isn't developing?  Their emissions will only continue to grow at the large rate they're growing at now, and do you seriously believe they'll actually lower emissions?  The only way that will happen is if they put more government regulation and stranglehold over the little bit of capitalism they have, and allow hundreds of millions of people suffer the consequences just like what was happening a few decades ago there.

Firstly, public sentiment: many people are afraid of nuclear anything, and they're afraid of a nuclear meltdown occurring near them. While nuclear meltdowns are very uncommon, the few times they do happen are spectacular and publicized to death. Additionally, the risk of a meltdown is elevated for areas that lie on a fault line.

Secondly, as AMGwtfBBQsauce said, nuclear power generation leaves waste that takes thousands of years to become inert. Handling, processing, and storing this waste provides a large challenge to the power industry, and it leads to my last reason.

Finally, the main reason nuclear power generation isn't common is that nuclear facilities take LOTS of money to build. Look at fuel-burning plants now: most are over 50 years old, but it costs less to repair and remodel than to rebuild from scratch. Nuclear facilities are even worse, as they need special components, additional safety features, and highly-trained staff. ALL of which is possible, and all of which will generate huge returns on the investment, but no company wants to take the risk.

Solar, wind, and hydroelectric power aren't without flaw, either. Solar is only effective in areas that are frequently sunny. Wind turbines are loud and tend to kill a lot of birds. Hydroelectric is damaging to river life. And each of the aforementioned options are expensive. That's the bottom line with all of this: nobody wants to front the money to upgrade. Energy companies don't want to put down more than they absolutely need to to keep the lights on (literally and figuratively). Fossil fuels are the worst choice out of all of them, but they're cheaper, and that's all the fat cats worry about.",8.0,1.0,,1WKoj-kodBw,

The main problem of exorbitantly high living costs in the state can be blamed on it's own success the high job creation rate is beating it's housing growth rate placing massive strain in local infracture and services to expand. 40% of cities are economically strained but bankruptcy for most of those cities are still a ways off due to continuing growth. At the moment California is planning to implement policies to offset the high living costs by sanctioning the construction of more high density housing and tying extra funds to cities that accept these projects. (Palo Alto remains adamant about not building high density housing because most residents are millionaires and would rather preserve the small town feel of the city)

I've lived in the bay area and live close by and many of us agree that the living costs are insane but the new govt transportation projects will likely offset silicon valley's growing pains and make it easier to live further away by opening up the low cost housing market in the rural countryside to major metropolitan centers.

Ships, trucks, trains, planes, electricity itself! These things all use fossil fuels. The food doesn't get from the farm to the factory to the distributer that you go in your car to get to through magic. It doesn't get grown, produced, stored, and¬†prepared¬†through fucking magic. Everything you get from a store, restaurant, fast food joint, you name it has taken mostly fossil fuels to get it to the point where you actually get to eat it. 
On top of that there is a large number of people who got to make a living in this process, like the farmer, driver, manufacturer, driver again, clerk/cook. These peoples wage needs to factor in the expense of their own energy needs at home away from the business.
This means that when a regulation, tax, or higher costing energy supply is forced then the cost of food has to go up as well.
lets say costs go up for energy...
farmers spend more in production and¬†for home expenses¬†so they raise their price, manufacturer buys it. It needs to be brought to them by trucks, costs the trucker more to transport and to pay the drivers so they raise the price. Manufacturer now has to pay more for getting it and will have to for production so when they sell it they will charge more. Then the store buys it and has to pay another trucking company. So the store raises the prices and ideally should be paying their workers more for cost of living, they don't cause they know if they raise prices too much then you will just go somewhere else. The person already close to minimum wage takes a small hit. You still got to¬†pay the difference in the end. 
This process like climate change is a slow and inconsistent one. In¬†a month which is as far as people tend to look in terms of cost of living this is not noticeable. Over a year only the most penny pinching person can notice. But over ten years, 20 years, all the changes that force costs on the economy build up and add to our rate of inflation. This is when people start saying ""wow things sure aren't as cheap as they used to be."" Of course we blame this single handedly¬†on inflation but this isn't the case.
Then of course government bases tax rates on percentages. This wouldn't be a big deal if it was just inflation, but they are also forcing the economy to be more expensive to run. Do to the fact these are arbitrary costs that don't affect our monies value just the value of items then the proportionate amount of taxes for an item and businesses goes up. Yet again the government makes it even more expensive.
Things don't have to cost as much as they do. The cost of¬†food could be much lower over¬†a years spread. If it costs just a dollar less¬†a day to feed a person then my mom and dad you were always poor raising my sister and I could have saved 1460 dollars a year. 
For a poor family that makes a huge difference let me tell you. For the economy this is massive. Now people who don't need the extra money have more money to spend(odds are that many will). This means more opportunities for business to get more money. Higher production allows a business to grow and create jobs, pay better even assuming they want to be more competitive and they do. This means more people could have jobs and better jobs could become available. 
EFFICENCY IS EVERYTHING!!!!

The Paris Climate Agreement is established with little to no structure that would enforce anything significant to prevent global warming, but what it does do is establish a handicap to a variety of businesses in the United States which would lead to major job loss. I don't believe that a group of world powers should dictate something that would effect the US economy directly, nor should it dictate other countries economy in the same way. I believe it should be an internal decision based on our countries needs in particular as should all other developed countries with their own respective environmental protection legislature. I am not saying in anyway that global warming isn't an issue because I believe it is, but the world is still formed with borders and imaginary lines to represent the domain of rule for each respective government and America should focus on our own environmental problems rather than it be controlled by a large array of other countries with loosely binding papers for only the next couple of decades. If the world wants to prevent global warming then we should all do our part, but not in such a way that it would hinder the global market and give others a foothold over another. China currently leads the world in respect to carbon emissions but they have no EPA equivalent that the United States does, and as well the EPA isn't currently set up properly in the United States to enforce or prevent further negative effects to the environment. I believe we should focus on our internal agencies and set forth standards in our own country to prevent global warming rather than making agreements with the rest of the world to hold off until ten years down the line til we start worrying about. 

I know I will probably get down voted and people don't really like other viewpoints, but this is why I agree with ditching the Paris Agreement, not because it is bad, but because I believe it is the wrong first step to take to prevent global warming.",0.0,0.0,,1WKoj-kodBw,

I believe in capitalism and the free market, but let's not kid ourselves. There are hundreds of examples where the free market has done poorly and even hurt many people.

We see this happen in much more nefarious ways when it comes to things like electrical power and railroads. People that own companies (such as an electric company) will do everything in their power to keep as many people using that product or tech regardless of the effect on the consumer.
I agree with absolutely everything else, but let's be real but you even end the explanation of this thought with there needs to be SOME SORT OF REGULATION TO MAKE THE MARKET TRULY FREE.

3. The word ""historically"" is sneaky here, the US has been producing more CO2 for longer, but produces much less than china, (17 - 27%)
Taking it back to the polluting factories on a river analogy, it's like the cleaner factory having to pay the more polluting one because it's older.

service jobs to china and india, and the solution is to give them 
hundreds of billions of tax dollars for free? And goldman sachs takes a 
few billion off the top of course since the money goes through them. But it's okay, because we're a 'rich' country.
 Because a few ultra rich people happen to live here, and we're making 
the best of a shitty situation, it's okay to take from the dwindling 
productive class to give it to the very trustworthy government of china 
and india.

I also love the slimy tactic of ye old switcheroo. 
""Historically the largest emitter of carbon"". Yes, historically. A long

the US? How many ultra rich corrupt kleptocrat billionaire communist 
statist slave drivers do they need until they're considered a 'rich' 
country and thus they're not considered for another one of these really 
great free money programs?

It's about paying your ""FAIR SHARE""! 
Because of course, the boomers were allowed to thrive in an economy with
 relatively few 'environmental' controls, they made their money, bought 
all the houses, and then the government taxed the shit out of them. Then
 the government from Bush 1 to Obama spent it on predator drones and 
occupation forces in Europe and east Asia. THEREFORE, the jobless and 
opportunitiless millennials have to pick up the slack and give an even 
larger fraction of the money we don't have to ""fix historical

And ""not doing anything until 2030"" is also wrong. China has to act immediately (and is doing so) to change the course of development to meet the 2030 goals. Otherwise total CO2 emitted by China would far exceed that amount. It's not something China can start doing, say in 2029, and expect to work. Same with India. There have been recent reports that China and India are on track to meet their goals far earlier than expected, so in fact, they're not only sticking to the agreement, they're exceeding it.

Create a pr that drives an attraction and run the product at a loss, and buy all and everything out and then control the market of the source in order to manipulate and control the market. Its the same thing you can do in video games. (auctioneering and manipulation of the resources.) Capitalism in the sense of monopolies is not the lawful or use of exchange goods its slavery at its finest. Stealing the labours of many and draining the real processes of governing.

If I buy out a store or function or product or innovation or development, or invention or products I dislike, I can litterally control and force out market values. Go and look at china nd the knock offs of the market demand from rhino horns as a potent male stimulant. Its bullshit. This mental state has caused a non realistic market in which is prettied with lies and nonsense. Asaiatics are enemy natiosn and teach exploitations and seed destruction. They are a war mongering people that will never realize it because they believe in freedom to lie, its in their localized markets. Its a dishonest situation, and in order to facilities lawful markets one needs regulations nadlaws that do not destroy but protect markets in which create, values. These values are associated to scoialiogy of cause and affect and virtues. So in a sense it creates the development of strong willed good people. It doesn't spiritually destroy the mental capacity of a society for the illusion of grandeur that sniffles the real mental development of a society. 

All commerce and marketing is non developmental for anything. There are and is different ways to create products, most are out of a challenge and much more that have created the best innovations. The I think I can and I have time to try. Not industrial slavery that creates mimic products and predatory rental, and there markets. in which destroy and divide the host markets. 


Anyone that thinks they know the rule of economics, entirely misses what a market is and natural markets before a mark of exchange of works. What constitutes what and the use of money. How it operates and its performance. IT money sniffles and impedes the benevolence or development of a society, it is under tyranny. However, people claiming they should get everything for free for another nation in which sold themselves off and createnadn pander lies is a danger to every virtue of a  society that is supposedly to invest in a their own state o their offspring. Instead the global world and its pandering lies, has adopted this weird guilt ridden nonsense, in which we all have t bend over because of guilt and give a bunch of tyrants and monopolies everything. Then we have the military problem which has become a subset group out of the civilities, its like mixing oil and water, wit the nonsense oftraitsn ad values being purported to develop. What does one do? When its like we have our own ideals to treat certain aspects, and then everyone comes in saying your racist an all this and that, in which these people did and made no works, but are given everything to excel, Whilst robbing and taken away the ability for those more adept to excel. 

Its beyond the market and economics to the function of a society and the so called market demand.
It's how commerce works to undermine the society to sell goods is eastern trait. Look at Samsung, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, China. Then look at the nonsense they have adopted. To the very exploitation of the markets, and any knowledge is perverted to people want to be god, its the same as the food demand business in which monopolizes and controls markets. 

Monopolies are dangerous because their demands become the writ law, and not the law in which it regulates. 

As a final note, Socrates, and tiberius conversation about justice is a great piece to read, and ruin comes to injustice for its sins pile high, isn't a lie, its direct thought of wisdom of the past, How big a fortress of wall do you think yo can build, Nature forces the solution to arise to destroy the abomination of mankind imaginations, of bullshit. Of their god like nonsense of grandeur. Humility.? Humble.? The world steals and takes and takes. and yet it must take more.... 

Are we to kill in order to give some semblance of peace for a temporal time, until the next generation thinks its the first?its so bizarre. Look at the last 40 years of stagnation for the most part in redundancy of philosophical idelologue and innovation its like lock down political storm, with very much a forced narrative or death camp like apparatus that operates.

This is also estimate. Overhead shop outlet payments to employees. 50 employees retail shop.1.200.000. Subsidized governing pay. OF course sales can push the goods. Lease for store operations . 12k 10 120,000

1.450.000.00 operating costs. However, the operating costs doesn't include all the other items and many other means. The value is a lot higher, as most shops have thousands of items and outrageous prices and have to turn these products around and around. So its a snake eating its tail nonsense thing.

In reality... its more like 5.6million merchandise value. same employee average. and lease costs. usually the store and shipping is about 1/3 - 1/5 the cost. So the profit is fairly large. Thats my rant..

Meh, your comment is lacking.  Since when is burning fossil fuels equivalent to poisoning everyone?  Yeah it releases a lot of harmful stuff if your aren't using scrubbers, but most places use scrubbers.  You can virtually remove everything but the CO2 from the exhaust from power plants.  And I wouldn't call CO2 a poison. 
Also your 6 million times seems a little pointless, I am guessing your basing on energy per kilogram, which really isn't fair comparing fission to a chemical based on weight.

(Sarcasm) I've done more research than most ""scientists"" including the gentleman in this video too evidently. As stated before (do your own research) there is no comparison to be drawn between CO2 in the atmosphere. Proof has shown that there have been times in the distant past where CO2 in the atmosphere has been >7000ppm yet the average temperature remained the same. You can dispute that fact all day long but you can't dispute the laws of thermodynamics and expect anyone to take you seriously. The earth has and will continue to lose heat since it's creation. This hoax has gone too far. Eventually they're going to want to introduce a breathing tax because you exhale some CO2 and with 7 billion people in the world we can't have all of these people polluting the atmosphere with they're breathing. What's after that capping all volcanoes, hydrothermal vents, and any other source of the massive amount of CO2 the earth is releasing (more than what humans would ever do unless we were trying)? Plants need CO2 to survive, they even thrive with extra CO2 introduced into their environment. People are acting like simple common carbon dioxide is freon or something. It's almost laughable. I'm not saying all of the data was breached and changed, only the in the last 20 years or so did people realize that they could use this hoax to make a boatload of free money. Look at the 3 billion dollars we were scheduled to send some EU climate agency. That money would have been pocketed without an actual bit of research being done as bonuses. Thank goodness we bowed out. It would have cost our economy many billions of dollars. It would be nice if people dedicated as much time, energy, and money as they do on this hoax on things like defeating ISIS, cures for diseases, and clean water for 3rd world nations just to name a few. You know, real problems that actually exist. If there was an actual problem of this magnitude the most intelligent people in the world would be working on it. Elon Musk is is continuing with his Tesla and Space X businesses as usual. Dr. Michiu Kaku is still working on his physics projects, the scientists at CERN are going on with business as usual etc etc etc. As stated before, during medieval times average temperature was higher than it is now so using the flawed thinking that this hoax based off of the earth is actually cooling. None of the whistle blowers that I'm talking about were disproved. There were major changes to the algorithm for temperature predictions due to these whistle blowers honesty. Government officials found that the data was changed to fit the global warming narrative more than hundred times using unreliable ship measured data that was switched with the more accurate bouy measured data AND removing the also reliable satellite measured data. After the changes were made the system showed that the average remained the same yet reporters continued to run with the false data because it fits they're narrative. At the very least, look at it from the laws of thermodynamics point. The earth is cooling and will continue to do so, that's undisputable by any way you look at it.

Firstly, no, the amount of money to be earned is negligible considering the scale of the effort required. If you're going to claim otherwise, I'm really going to need to see a citation to support it. I'm aware of the ""whistleblowing"" you're referring to. Those have been debunked time and time again; they're essentially cases of blatant quote-mining, with the original context pertaining to the need to reliably control for skewing factors in the data. There is a massive scientific consensus on this. And a huge amount of evidence. 
I don't think you're getting just how much data backs this up. Years of unrelated research in geology, astronomy, paleontology, meteorology, physics, chemistry, and probably a bunch of other fields I'm not aware of, all points to the conclusion that we're screwing up the climate. You can't fake that much data, particularly given that a lot of it is historical. 
The very thing you point out--the fact that humans have so many problems--means that we also can't coordinate well enough to perpetuate a hoax of that magnitude. We simply don't work together well enough. Everyone would have to be on the same page, and frankly, it's just not doable. Science is by its nature meant to be open. Anyone can take part. Yes, there are things like degree requirements and research paywalls (the latter of which goes against the nature of science and which is a thing many professionals are working to correct), but the fact remains that anyone can examine the data or do their own research. Is data falsifiable? Yes, but science runs on repeatability, so hoaxes don't tend to last long, and they tend to be of a small scale. 
Let me give you some examples. The greenhouse effect is well-documented. Ever heard of Venus? That's an extreme case, but the fact that it exists as it does at all shows that the effect is real. And yes, the Earth's climate has changed over time, but it's about rapidity, not magnitude. The Holocene warming has been a spike of unprecedented proportions. Geologically, it has been instantaneous. 
You want an example of how speed affects things? During the early Palaeogene, the Earth's climate was warm enough that there were palm trees at the poles, but the shift was gradual, and there was no associated major mass extinction. Let's look at the P-Tr extinction, though, otherwise known as the Great Dying. During that, extreme supervolcanism caused a near-immediate spike in carbon dioxide levels, causing massive warming, something potentially exacerbated by the initial warming melting unstable methane clathrates and pumping even worse greenhouse gases into the atmosphere (something that could still potentially happen today, by the way). What happened as a result of this warming? Well, on a side note, I should probably mention that coral bleaching, something which is also being observed today, caused massive marine dieoffs, but there was something else even worse. Ever hear of anoxia? Basically, the ocean only has usable oxygen because the stuff in the air dissolves into the water. That's not very stable, and abrupt warming will mess it up. The result is something we call anoxia, where large parts of the ocean lose their oxygen content, suffocating the life and crumbling the base of the food chain. During the Permian, this in association with other factors killed off as much as 95% of all life on Earth. That was an extreme case, but anoxia is implicated in many extinction events, and scientists widely agree that we're already in the middle of a full mass extinction, the like of which hasn't been seen for sixty-six million years. It's not a good time to screw with the climate. This is something we've understood, at least in part, for a very long time, by the way. And it's just one (admittedly extreme) example.

Glacial ice advancing through the Midwest over tens or hundreds of thousands of years as documented based on correct information is further proof of the natural heating and cooling (cooling in the very long term based on thermodynamics) of the earth.

Atmospheric CO2 was at 7000ppm as opposed to today's 400ppm during the Cambrian period yet the average temperature of the earth was about on par with what it is today. As early as the Jurassic period atmospheric CO2 levels were nearly 3000ppm again, as opposed to today's 400ppm. There is no comparison to draw between CO2 levels and earth's average temperature over the billions of years earth has existed. Second, let's talk about the law of thermodynamics. Just as anything else, the earth has and will continue to lose heat as the planet cools from it's formation. The same thing will happen to the sun after it expends all of it's fuel. The earth is still cooling from it's creation. Look at the super deep boar hole in Russia, one of the reasons they discontinued drilling is because measured temperatures reached more than 300¬∞ Fahrenheit. Lastly let's get into the obvious, humans have been around for far less than 1% of the total time of Earth's existence. Would you be able to accurately tell the content of a photo by only seeing less than 1% of it? Many of the statistics for basing this idea on are from a supposed recent spike in the global temperature from temperatures we have been measuring for far less than a thousand years (for argument sake I won't get into how long exactly we've been measuring temperature) now. It's also been widely accepted that during medieval times the average temperature in terms of recent time was substantially greater than the average temperature now yet we didn't have any of the modern mass CO2 releasing items  we have now. As easy as it is to have someone else just give you information and accept it as fact it's more reliable to do your own research and base your information on that.

That's using the UN's own climate prediction model.

The cost of the Paris climate pact is likely to run to 1 to 2 trillion dollars every year, based on estimates produced by the Stanford Energy Modeling Forum and the Asia Modeling Exercise. In other words, we will spend at least one hundred trillion dollars in order to reduce the temperature, by the end of the century, by a grand total of three tenths of one degree.

The Climate Action Tracker, widely cited by, predicts a temperature reduction of 1.6 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century. But this prediction is based very heavily on the assumption that even stronger climate policies will be adopted in the future. Actually, 98% of the assumed reductions will come only after 2030, which is what the current Paris agreement covers. And even such wishful thinking won't achieve anything close to the 2 degrees Celsius reduction that has become the somewhat arbitrary, but widely adopted, benchmark to avoid the worst effects of global warming. The actual promised emission reductions under the Paris agreement literally get us just 1 percent of the way to the 2 degrees target. 99 percent of what would be required is put off until after 2030.

The Paris Agreement is the wrong solution to a real problem. The right solution will most likely be found through green-energy research and development, like that promoted by Bill Gates and the Breakthrough Coalition. Mr. Gates has announced that private investors are committing $7 billion for clean energy R&D.

just set another agreement in the near future 2030-2040 (40 years before 2080 aka. the point of no return date. thats a good enough time scale for motivation momentum needed and innovation/transition to green energy)

spacex. after investing and planning. it basically overtakes the efficiency/impact of nasa's future rocket plans?
why?
didn't spacex and several other space companies was given liberty and opened the gates for more investors by obama?
hence more competition, and innovation?


green technology needs the same momentum, innovation, competition as spacex has. its more faster than just agreeing what to do with little backing.

I am all for controlling pollution but let's be honest, the US has done more in past 30 to 40 years than any nation has thought of and we continue to so why not the rest of the world?
We pay billions of our tax dollars to countries that talk a good game but don't do anything to stop their run away emissions.  I will say that it's not fair and those countries need to pay their fair share and show marked progress.
Our energy sector has taken a beating and its time to stop the bleeding.  Get our coal and steel jobs back.  There is so much better science today that pollution levels are minuscule compared to decades ago.

Is this a joke?  Or are you trying to say that the CO2 that comes from an engine has an extra carbon atom in it?  Or one less oxygen atom?

Or perhaps you simply don't know anything about chemistry; because molecules of any particular type are effectively fungible. They are commodities. Not to mention that the CO2 coming from an engine is comprised of carbon and oxygen that has been in circulation on this planet for some 4.5 billion years, not something recently created or added to our planet.

Oh wait, I get it...you're saying engines are the answer to the alchemical pursuits because they change one type of element into another thus generating CO2 out of other base materials. If I run  the CO2 back through the engine again, could we produce gold?

Internally the US, is actively reducing CO2 emissions through it's education and efforts.  Take a look at the reaction from some states deciding to maintain the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement.  They took this on, on their own accord.  Great job to them for taking positive steps.  Citing another example, when Volkswagen misrepresented emissions, this was in large part found out by the US market.  Our consumers do in fact check the facts.

There are countries that are going to evolve economically, that are driven by their government.  Their people do not have a strong enough voice yet, to be the fact checkers that we have.  They will get there, meanwhile the decision to release pollution in the environment is how they operate.

Validating their actions because they are the ""new kids on the block"" is not a good argument.  We are rewarding bad behavior!

If one of these evolving countries manufacturers Steel as an example.  Their process is much less expensive than ours.  The emissions from these companies is much higher than hours.  A simple laymen's test, drive by a US Factory, then a drive by a country's factory that does not have a strong ""Fact Checker"" resource.  The difference is not subtle.  US Factories are held to a higher standard, by our own Fact Checkers.

Economics.  A large project that involves steel in its construction is going to go with the lowest bidder.  Everyone will tell you that there are other considerations, however at the end of the day, the low bidder will win.  The low bidder is more often than not the country that is manufacturing the product for substantially less because their general population of people do not have the voice that US Fact checkers do have.

Result of the above.  Manufacturing is pushed out of the US.  Emerging country is allowed to pollute,  destroying itself and the environment, project gets completed on budget.  I don't see this as a ""win"" for the environment.  It's just a win for the project as it came in on budget.

The Paris Climate Agreement does not help solve the problem.

Adding an XX% import tax to goods that are produced in countries without a sound environmental policy would be a better solution.  The environmental policy cited has to have teeth.  Nothing can be voluntary, participation needs to be mandatory.  Additionally the Fact Checkers of that country need to be encouraged to do just that.",25.0,0.0,,1WKoj-kodBw,

Trump withdrawing from the agreement also allows people to think again on climate change. People are terrified over it when really it's happened many, many times in Earth's history and sure it can drastically change the planet but it's sure as hell reversible at any stage. And the other thing is drastic change isn't the horror story a lot of people make it out to be. If we do nothing about these toxins, Earth will become more like other planets. That could be a very good thing. It could allow us to adapt to Earth's more drastic climate which could result in better preparing us for the far harsher climates of other planets, and even the worst predictions are nothing compared to other planet's climate's. Also I don't think withdrawing from this agreement will change the States direction to being cleaner. The market is in that direction and a lot of people are excited for it and people excitement for it isn't going to change because the gov. isn't enforcing it anymore. Sure there will be a few that revert to old ways, but there's still going to be plenty of companies and groups of people seeking to improve cleaner tech. ANd there's a plenty of consumers who are environmentally conscious. Imo whether the states is in the agreement or not is irrelevant to what the States does from this point regarding clean energy.

The temperature effect of co2 is logarithmic, meaning part per Part the temperature increase diminishes as co2 levels increase. So to feel the same effect as the increase from 200-400ppm we need to go from the current 400ppm levels to 800ppm of co2. All of the models and IPCC reports indicate that co2 alone is not capable of creating a catastrophic positive feedback loop of unending warming. Over the last 30 years total vegetation on earth has increased, gaining as much as the united states worth in area of extra vegetation, likekly due to the positive effect of co2 and its use in photosynthesis along with some other factors. See these are actual facts.

The Paris agreement may be ""nonbinding"" but the expectations are implement carbon tax, aggressive regulations, and extensively fund international projects and other country's energy systems. This is what it says in the agreement. The US can frankly make it's own choices. Also a carbon tax will hurt overall gdp and make goods cost more, simply pointing to a country that had growth despite a carbon tax doesn't mean the carbon tax had no effect.

In the early to mid 1900s we spewed a lot of pollution so the generation born in the 1990s and afterward should be willing to stifle their personal growth so that China and India can do what our forefathers did. If it was not good then, it's not good now. You're asking the conservatives to care more about the poor of India and China than the Middle class in America. I think we should absolutely be setting an example and creating the technologies and advancements that will make the world a better place to live, but that particular point fell flat for me. If someone thinks they can explain it better (explain how it's not the children bearing the burden of their father's sins or how the US wouldn't be subsidizing the industrial and economic expansion of China by taking on the burden of not using the cheapest forms of energy so that these other poorer countries can do so).

It's time to admit the ""important starting point"" line is a dangerous lie. Paris was the THIRD major climate agreement (Kyoto, Copenhagen, and Paris) and none of them got beyond the starting point. None of them can get beyond a starting point because the legislation is ill-conceived from the beginning. Saying ""important starting point"" is now getting in the way of real progress because we need to--unpopular opinion warning!--step back and rethink our clearly flawed approach rather than fail at brute forcing dumb and ineffective solutions.",0.0,0.0,,1WKoj-kodBw,

First off, no member of the agreement has to abid by any standards set forth by the agreement as there will be no consequences. The US goal of reducing their use of fossil fuels by 26%-28% wasn't ""made"" by anyone else but the US as they set their own standards. Secondly, wealthy nations agreed to put forth 100 billion dollars, and even though it is true that the US definitely contributed much more than many other nations did it shouldn't be ignored that other nations such as China contributed as well. It should also be mentioned that many of the other nations such as China and India are still developing and in return have to take some cuts to get their population out of poverty, but even they are making progress on cutting down their emissions, for example in January China shut down 103 previously planned coal plants and have also installed thousands of wind turbines  (on some days they installed 2 every hour). But whats in it for the US? In the long run you have to look at it like this. The agreement encouraged the US to go down on a path that they have already been heading down for a while, currently the US has more double the amount of people working on solar energy alone than on coal mining and other fossil fuels. The reason why is because it has become far cheaper than other energy resources such as coal and in the process has made the US billions of dollars. So the question is, why pull out of an agreement that has been encouraging you to do the exact thing that you are already doing and that you are also making plenty of money on already? There is just no logic in it. The US is leading both the global fight against climate change and is the largest profiter of the coversion to cleaner energy, so why pull out? Wouldn't you want to help the rest of the world develop in a market that you are dominating already? I should concluded by saying that in all of this the US will continue to move more towards clean energy even after leaving the agreement. States see the benifits of moving toward clean energy, rather that be the environmental reasons or for the profits. Coals not coming back and nor is any fossil fuel even with the current administration lifting of restrictions placed on the extraction of these resources, its just no longer profitable.

3027,UgjArMvSWLpySHgCoAEC,UgjArMvSWLpySHgCoAEC,2017-06-05T00:19:54Z,Minna Liu,"Joel Tan I mean, as mentioned, the us and Europe got rich using manufacturing methods that account for about 30% of the excess carbon in our atmosphere each, so it's only fair that the problem they started should be fixed mostly by them. Not to mention the US is rich enough to adapt to these changes while poorer, growing countries simply do not. To impose the same goals on developing countries where the majority of the population are still living in poverty would ACTUALLY crash their economy, unlike the US, which might lose some industries in the short term, but would end up gaining more back because they would presumably be investing in clean tech. Which has about 30% more investment potential than fossil fuels, correct me if I'm wrong. I'm not googling much rn. Also, these countries (China and India), have substantially larger populations than the US, so it's only natural that those countries have higher CO2 emissions. It should also be noted that while China is by and far the largest contributor to co2 emissions currently, their carbon footprint per capita is much, much smaller than the American one, showing us that Americans can absolutely do more to reduce their own carbon footprint. Not to mention China is investing in far more clean tech than the states, so while they may be polluting much more now, in a couple decades, this will change. And while China is indeed rich, they're simply in an economic bubble right now, and their economy is far from stable. So to force harsh restrictions on their poorest working class and close down the factories from which they get their small source of income and push them into deeper poverty is simply unjust. While in the states, taxes may increase and coal factories or oil rigs might close down in the future, the people working in these economic sectors have far more opportunities to move into other economic sectors. I'm not saying that this wouldn't be difficult for many, but it certainly wouldn't put as many people into extreme poverty as it would in China. And India, the country's focus is to first give the majority of their citizens access to electricity. There are still people in poverty who burn cow dung for energy, so it seems a little unfair to tell them to use more expensive methods with money they don't have to slow raising the standard of living for their citizens. One more thing, if you look at emissions from 1970-2013, it is a different story from 2013 alone. In 2013's global carbon emissions alone, China if first by a long shot, followed by the US, EU, then India. But from 1970-2013 The US is the number one emitter of CO2, followed by the EU, then China and Russia, India doesn't show up until 7th place. And from 1970-2013, the incredibly large carbon footprint per capita of an American is tens of times larger than that of a Chinese or Indian. So while I do want countries like China and India to do more, it is just a irrefutable fact that they cannot do as much (without putting millions more into poverty) to curb their carbon emissions as rich countries can, especially the US and EU, which as mentioned, are every bit, if not more, responsible for our climate woes as China and India.

There is also a cost in raising energy prices. An estimated *10 million* people died across the world as a consequence of the 1973 oil crisis.

Meanwhile, people dying from ""extreme weather events"" continues to decline. We're down over 90% since the 1920s, despite a 4x growth in world population. Improved energy access is to thank for that.

Raise the cost of energy by insisting on inefficient sources, you handicap the 3rd world's development, you turn food secure populations food insecure, and all other amenities from consumer goods, to housing to medicine become nigh inaccessible.

Currently governments do not enforce the property rights of non-emitters enough, i.e. the whole economy has to bear the damage of the carbon-emitting companies.

It certainly was her fault to try to unite both sides instead of following Trump's example of preaching to her own camp, making them go to vote by telling whatever lies necessary. Then again, she would no be in the same situation as Trump: with an inconsistent political agenda without any option to negotiate, unable to deliver on the promises other than making crude symbolic moves. Unlike Trump she did not get in there purely to line her own pockets (although certainly not for altruistic motives either), so that would have been the limit of the strategy you proposed.

When you have a 400+ delegate lead straight from the start; people lose the will to challenge you. People saw Clinton and in their minds they thought ""Oh, no one else has a chance to win so I mine as well support her""
It's basic psychology that both major parties use to sway the minds of their voters. 

The delegate system was clearly messed with to favor Clinton, as well as voter deadlines and other factors. This is evidence of multiple primary and caucus race results (you can search this up if you don't believe me). We'll start with the results of the Utah, Wyoming, and West Virginia caucuses and primaries. 

West Virginia voted heavily in favor for Bernie Sanders. All 64 counties went to him, yet Clinton somehow managed to get a close amount of delegates to Sanders. I don't remember the exact numbers, but it was close. Utah (my home state btw) went for Bernie overwhelmingly as well. No county came close to going for Clinton. Sanders won 17 delegates, yet Clinton somehow managed to get 9 of the delegates. And Wyoming voted for Sanders by 80%, yet Clinton got HALF of the delegates there. Unless the people at the DNC are terrible at math, there's clearly something fishy about the ways the delegates were divided. Some super delegates had a factor in this, but a lot of these were regular delegates. 

And my favorite state...good ol New York. New York had a voter deadline a long time before the actual vote in New York. That means that Independent voters (whom Sanders has a huge lead in) tried to sign up as a Democrat to vote for him. An estimated 2 million people were denied voting because of this mishap. 

Many closed primaries and caucuses close their voting registration periods long in advance before the election starts to get moving. This allows the party to indirectly target uneducated and undecided voters because time is against them. 

And finally you got the DNC emails. You don't need to be an idiot to know that the party was against Sanders after reading them. Clearly the Democrats favored a candidate that represented their interests and not that of the people whom they claim to represent. 

And look how that turned out for them. You got arguably the most disliked candidate in recent history that everyone assumed would be easy to beat, yet Clinton lost. She not only lost a majority of the States Obama carried; But she lost the damn rust belt! An area that Democrats dominate went for the orange bafoon because unlike Clinton, he represented change. A frightening change, but a change nonetheless. (quote from Jonathan Pie). Now we have this maniac and his close circle of millionaires and billionaires destroying the country.

Sanders and Trump are both similar in the sense that they're anti establishment and populist. While it's clear that Trump clearly lied and is fueling his own interests, Sanders has 40 years of history to back up his populism. 

Sanders had an advantage in the Midwest states which are starting to matter more and more. His policies are relatable because all people want decent healthcare, they want good paying jobs, they want excellent education. Sanders could've easily turned a number of red states blue because his message resonates to millions. Clinton managed to alienate crucial voters and solidified the Democrats as a group that doesn't favor working people in areas that the Republicans dominate. 

History repeats itself a lot. It's clear that 2020 will be a crucial year for the Democratic party. If they fail to have open and fair primaries and caucuses, you can except another establishment candidate to lose to Trump. Having a populist like Sanders run will be an easy way to win big. People resonate with people who truly care for them. And if the Democrats can't realize that, then they can kiss their election chances goodbye b",0.0,1.0,,1WKoj-kodBw,

The reason are 50% of the voters deciding that they agree to whoever the other 50% would choose, because for some reason her handful of unproven semi-scandals were considered worse than the trail of absurdly inexcusable things Trump did. 

Therefore one can blame roughly 75% of all US voters for the crap they caused: the 25% who voted for Trump and the 50% who declared full agreement on that outcome. 
But I am sure, four years from now they will show as much spine as they did after the war in Iraq, which the US americans enjoyed starting: it just was that one man who is to blame, we were all fooled by him and we are good people.

Cancellation of climate treaty is best wisely decided
By Simon Rozendaal - June 01, 2017
The fact that US President Donald Trump steps out of the Paris climate agreement is a sensible decision - perhaps the first wise decision - of a remarkable, sometimes even, somewhat crazy president.
The agreement reached in the French capital in 2015 is futile in the fight against global warming. First of all, the agreements made in Paris for most countries are no more than a fa√ßade. Many, especially non-Western world leaders, know that European politicians and NGOs (source of development money and other support) make an impression of greening and applauded at the Parisian stage for windmills and solar cells, realizing that there is only one Way is to elevate their poor countries: cheap coal.
Does America withdraw from Climate Agreement? Trump keeps the tension in it
Even if all countries would agree to the agreements made in Paris, it would be of no use. As shown by the Copenhagen Consensus Center of the clever Deen Bjorn Lomborg based on United Nations figures, Paris produces a cooling of 0.05 degrees Celsius in 2100. Well, if you finish 0.05 then you get a big zero.
Why do things go out if Paris does not matter?
Of course, you can turn the argument down and say it's an irrelevant action from the American president to go from Paris. If a measure does not make a contribution, it also has no value.
However, that is not entirely true. In Europe there is a climate of hiding. Many, often well-trained young people with the heart in the right place think that global warming is the biggest problem the planet has ever experienced, that it is caused by people, in particular, that something is counteracting With windmills, solar cells and charging stations for electric cars) and that 'science' would agree. Perhaps the decision of Trump is such a cold shower for many of those people that wake them up.
At the same time, stopping Paris generates a lot of money with which all kinds of useful things can be done. For example, to quit scientific research aimed at developing alternative sources of energy (thorium nuclear energy, solar cells, 3rd generation biofuels) that are really cheaper than fossil fuels.",0.0,0.0,,1WKoj-kodBw,

Here's a chart of historical C02 levels: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/Carbon_Dioxide_400kyr.png
That is not a natural cycle. For the better part of a million years C02 has never risen even half as high as it is now. And this progression conveniently started just at the height of the Industrial Revolution. Your argument is so facile and unoriginal, and you have ZERO data to back it up. You're just saying the same tired shit over and over because you ""feel"" like it should be true, even though there's no evidence to support it and a ton of evidence dismissing it (which you ignore as hard as you can). You flatly assume that humans cannot contribute to the climate without any reason why. You claim ""natural cycles!"" as if the climate changes by magic and not via distinct, measurable processes (what exactly do you think climate scientists DO? Sit around waiting for the mighty Weather Wizard to wave his wand and change the ""cycles""?). 

And claiming scientists make stuff up to get funding is the most tired and ridiculous conspiracy theory of all. You're talking about hundreds of thousands of climate researchers, from every nation, every religion, every culture, with zero financial or administrative ties to one another, have somehow all agreed on perpetrating a global lie to just to get a bit more funding for their labs? They already HAD funding. Lies just put them and all their colleagues in jeopardy. Not to mention, Republicans have consistently cut funding for climate research in America whenever they're in power - By your logic, shouldn't that encourage some reputable American researchers to abandon the ""conspiracy"" and produce the ""true"" results of their data? But instead we see every last one of them sticking to their guns, despite potentially losing their jobs. Such loyalty to the conspiracy!

You have shown quite clearly that you have no idea how the scientific method works, how research funding works, or even how basic logical arguments work. So what exactly have you gotten from Veritasium's videos thus far? I guess you just like watching the Slinky drop?",2.0,1.0,,1WKoj-kodBw,

First you gather a ton of information from glaciers that show the gasses in the air at different times in the earths vast history. Then you plot those points and make a chart to make it easier to see trends and cycles. Here's where the politics kick in. You realize that there is no money for your research if there is no problem with what is happening. You look at the chart (this is key information here, so listen up) that represents most of the earths climates history and see that there are cycles and trends and that we are just a small part of those ongoing cycles. You see that CO2 levels also rise and fall along with these cycles and trends. But then your realize, ""Oh no!"" there is no problem! Your funds are going to disappear and none of your political friends will have anything to take advantage of! You know, those friends that initially gave you the money in order to, not find IF there is a problem, but TO find a problem. So you think of a crazy idea. What if, instead of showing everyone the whole graph that shows that we are a part of an ongoing cycle, instead you cut out about 99.999% of that graph and just show that past couple of hundred years. It's not lying after all. NOW it looks like a problem! Yay! Job saved! Who knew that even scientist could be corrupted? Like the supposed ""scientist"" bill nye the ""science"" guy! Who says that there are more than 2 genders! Oh, and don't forget the added pressure that this might put on all the other scientist to go along with the misinformation in order to save face. Because god forbid that any one find out that scientist can be corrupted with politics.

Again, you want to save the earth, stop chasing this red herring and save the forest, which are the biggest part of the earths feedback loop for regulating the climate. Stop using plastic, because its made from oil. And stop using oil. Not because of CO2. That's dumb. But to help stop OIL SPILLS in the ocean, which happens more than most people know all over the world! So, do you understand now?",0.0,1.0,,1WKoj-kodBw,
3392,UgjMnF_kkcNZFngCoAEC,UgjMnF_kkcNZFngCoAEC,2017-06-04T02:26:11Z,yotodine,"+TEIAC     Check out the comment bellow about your ""97%"", Also see my response to Copydot it incorporates the Climate change argument. But in short, yes everyone agrees that the climate changes, we call them seasons. And the overall climate, just like the seasons, goes through cycles. It is always changing. The argument here is that humans are changing it. We are not. The next argument is that we will kill the earth leaving future humans to suffer, because of CO2. CO2 is the key in the argument. IT IS NOT CO2 that is killing the earth, nor is it changing the climate. If you really want to save the earth, stop using oil, not because of CO2 but because of all the oil spills in the ocean trying to get oil! You want to help the earth's feedback mechanism, save the forests, like the amazon, then you wont have to worry about the big bad CO2! You want to save more fish species? Stop using plastic, which by the way, IS A PRODUCT OF OIL. ""Climate Change"" is just a red herring! And the things that trump said are right! See my response to Copydot for the full argument. Finally, CHINA IS NOT A DEVELOPING COUNTRY, IN FACT THEY OWN HALF THE WORLDS DEBT INCLUDING MOST OF AMERICAS. THATS RIGHT IN COMPARISON CHINA HAS A BIGGER UPPER CLASS THAN AMERICAS AND THEY ARE BUYING ALL OUR LAND OVER HERE FOR MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. Look it up",2.0,1.0,,1WKoj-kodBw,
3393,UgjMnF_kkcNZFngCoAEC,UgjMnF_kkcNZFngCoAEC,2017-06-04T02:10:55Z,yotodine,"+Copydot    This was my reply in the main comment section. And the thing about science and research is that sometimes the researchers (who are fallible human beings) can smudge the numbers in the favor of their hypothesis or misrepresent the data because of politics. Look it up, its what happened with this whole climate BS. My arguments correspond to his argument numbers.

1) If its non-binding, then who cares. No sign. The Canada thing, just 
one example. Not enough for an argument.

2). You are stuck where a lot of ""scientist"" get stuck. You are looking 
at a very, very small picture of the entirety of the worlds history to 
justify this argument. When you look at the WHOLE history of the worlds 
CO2 to temperature ratio, you realize that everything we do is pretty 
insignificant. There is no proof about intense storms. The worlds 
weather (or climate) is and has always changed. Again, look at ALL the 
information. Look at the Dinosaur fossils. Look at the grand canyon. 
Climate change! So no, the cost is so insignificant that it doesn't 
matter. Kinda like when walmart rounds the percentages of pennies.

3). China STILL DEVELOPING! They own everyones debt. how are they still 
""developing"". This argument is stupid. Trump is 100% correct! Wouldn't 
you want a country to develop clean. How about this. Instead of your 
city cleaning your water, they are just going to pump it from the Nile 
river to your house, you know, because your house hasn't finished being 
built. And when you build your house, you need to start with sticks. 
When you finished making a house of sticks, you can move on to solid 
wood, then after you finished building it with wood, then you get to use
 the new technology we had. No, no, your still developing your house, 
don't start with the best stuff first! Oh, yeah believe everything china
 tells you, they aren't emitting any co2. These aren't the droids your 
looking for.

4). refer to 2. and trumps speech again about the money.

5). Who said anything about its popularity??? I need to look at it 
again. Did trump say anything about its popularity?

The climate doesn't need saving. What needs saving are the oceans and the
 forests! Stop shipping oil over the seas and stop people from tearing 
down the forest.

Right now there is litterally trillions of tons of CO2 in our atmosphere that shouldn't be there. That is why human clinate change is a thing. Our world naturally tries to regulate the world temperature our oceans absorb alot of our CO2, but as temperatures rise it becomes harder for CO2 to dissolve. Therefore there is a point of no return, when the oceans can no longer absorb more CO2 then the natural world combined.

You know this to be true because it is what he does all the time. Lie, spin and twist facts. And his base is so die hard they don't care about truth or facts, they just gobble up all they are fed. A better solution would be excluding the US and then the rest of the world tariff everything sold from USA with an environment tax.

Not trying to take sides here but this seems to have already been perpetuated many many times throughout history - deals agreements and pacts that never really seem to impose any problem (Kellogg-Briand pact against use of arms as a means of conflict resolution 1928) and eventually fails. I think Trump is being objective at the fact that this isn't going to work and withdrew (along with other more questionable reasons)

For this reason alone I don't think Trump really deserves the hate he's getting. If the Paris Climate deal was more binding / strict then perhaps his hate would be more justified. While all other nations seem to be agreeing very superficially Trump has decided not to. He's a businessman and I think he's pretty direct as to his goals. Sure, the deal might work for a bit but only when the world is truly in deep shit will countries REALLY put in some sort of tangible, continued effort.

My point seems to be lost in the midst of my rambling, but bottom line is the problem lies not completely with trump but with the climate deal as well. If we were to stride towards a greener future, both ought to reevaluate their stance on the situation.

The money supposedly will help developing countries come up with a strategy for reducing their emissions. It's not clear how this money will be distributed (I've been trying to figure it out for half a day), and the goal of 100 billion is simply arbitrary. I'd like to know who is making money off this. 

Also, why did Obama rush to pay the second installment of $500 million? This is suspicious considering Obama is just part of the money-grubbing Hillary gang. 

Derek's first argument is that since the accord is nonbinding, why bail out? The same argument can be made in reverse. If the accord doesn't compel anybody to do anything, what's the point of staying in? 

Derek also argues although the accord does nothing, it's a first step; thus, we should go along with it. But if the first step is an expensive nothing, then going along with it doesn't make sense. Maybe it's a first step to enriching some of the Hillary gang. 

For example, solar energy is a positive technology, but that doesn't mean everything with the ""solar"" label is good and legitimate. Remember Solyndra? 

Derek's pro-CO‚ÇÇ reduction arguments are valid but irrelevant. I, personally, believe CO‚ÇÇ emissions need to be reduced. I even advocate not cutting lawns. And if you followed that advocacy, you'd do more to cut CO‚ÇÇ than jumping on the shaky Paris Accord bandwagon.",0.0,0.0,,1WKoj-kodBw,

That said, some of the reasoning in this video is very poor. Briefly...

1.) If going green was so good for the economy, the US and many other nations would have already jumped on it. Cherry picking a few statistics isn't a very convincing case.

2.) You have woefully misunderstood how a free market works, Veritasium. Free markets are not inherently fair. Its not fair that the US has to import resources because it lacks them. That's just how it is.

3.) Why should the US and Europe change their economies if India and China won't? Because they're already rich? Why not force oil heavy regions to give away oil? They already have plenty! Surely other countries could use it. That's not how the world works. Also, you say that the US has contributed 30% of the CO2 in the atmosphere. By allowing China and India a pass, you're simply allowing them to do the exact same thing. Its a bit mind boggling that, because the US has already done this that you'd allow China and India to do the exact same thing. Either its okay to get rich on the back of fossil fuels, or it isn't. You can't have it both ways.

4.)  Yeah, that whole first step was taken decades ago. It really hasn't worked out well (which is why the agreement was needed in the first place). False premise is false.

5.)  Its not popular with the US as a whole, agreed. But it is VERY popular with his base. He badly needs a win at this point.

A lot of green initiatives end up laden with ulterior motivations [wealth transfer via carbon credits], have disastrous unintended consequences [global economic impact of ethanol subsidies] and even delay progress. Consider the incentives (tax credits and so on) for CCFL bulbs and costs associated with minimizing their environmental impact: that same money could have been applied to accelerating the deployment of superior LED technology...or, the market left to simply act. How many tonnes of CO2 could have gone un-emitted or mercury kept from landfills had CCFL not been artificially cheapened? The legislation and money spent forcing a green economy based on wind and solar is similarly retarding modernization and deployment of new, safer, more efficient fission plants based almost entirely on negative associations with the defense industrial complex and cold-war era nuclear paranoia.

Even more appalling is the lackluster investment in fusion research. 20-billion for ITER. Twenty. And, it (optimistically) won't switch on till 2025. Seriously? That's a god damned scandal. It's a scandal and if the left really gave a damn, they'd never shut up about it.

Yes, India and China are both still growing so it would be unfair to hinder that growth. It is also true that if the government put regulations in place to reach that goal, it would reduce jobs in industries that have high carbon emissions (coal, natural gas, manufacturing, etc.). Also, although the Paris Climate Agreement is comprised of goals and not repercussions, there would still be repercussions if the US didn't meet our goal. It would make the US look noncommittal and incompetent compared to other nations that have. It was easier for Obama to sign it because he wouldn't receive any backlash if the US didn't meet our goal, but a future president would. There is probably some truth to your hypothesis of why Trump did what he did. I'm not sure we want to continue making him feel small though. We've seen that nothing good comes out of attacking him more than we attacked past presidents, such as when Obama messed up there was less coverage, whereas when Trump messes up (admittedly more often) there is more coverage per offense. His feeling attacked caused him to lash out and I doubt that would be good for the nation as a whole.

It is also wise to have a number of energies to rely upon but if that were to happen people will either choose oil/coal and nuclear.

2. ""It will be too hot to survive in the middle east"" 
First off during the medieval warming period, in which we went through a similar warming, the middle east didn't get that hot. 

3. Ocean acidification: Most of that is caused by ACTUAL pollutants, like Sulfur Dioxide, which then is oxidized and turned into Sulfate which then combines with two Hydrogen atoms becoming Sulfuric acid. Carbonic Acid and its weak base Bicarbonate will create a buffer system which will keep the pH of the oceans from changing too dramatically. 

4. Also CO2 levels and temperature aren't related because any CO2 that is released into the atmosphere will ultimately be absorbed by plants in a process called photosynthesis. Also the level at which CO2 becomes toxic will be reached within 1000 years at the current rate of increase. 

5. CO2 IS NECESSARY! If CO2 drops below 150ppm, plant growth stops entirely (which is the main reason for the climate change scare) so CO2 is the most important GHG and we need it to increase!

Key word ""eventually"". It's still being worked on. Not ready. Not viable yet. Many, many ways of saying: ""it's not possible to run the grid on renewables right now"".

Coal is suffering, oil is fairly stable, atm (due to fracking; would be in decline otherwise), gas is on the rise (due to fracking, and innovations that allow the gas to be captured instead of having to flare it off to prevent disasters). Fossil fuel is a lot more than just oil.

Hydro only barely breaks even. Wouldn't be surprised if it died out completely in the next couple of decades. Would probably be good for the local ecosystems, but then we'd lose the wondrous fish cannons...

Nuclear is expensive as hell to start up, even though it's cost effective while it's running. We're talking six to ten years of construction and billions of dollars just to get it running, not even the operating costs. Most power companies simply can't afford to take on such a project while fossil fuel (and even wind and solar) are so much cheaper to get running.

Wind isn't improving much, since there's only so many ways to stick a giant pinwheel on a generator. It really just comes down to location. There are also environmental concerns with wind power.

Photovoltaics have overtaken concentrated solar power recently, and Panasonic just showed off a new panel that has nearly half the temperature coefficient of the ones currently on the market; they're working on getting them to mass production now. So yes, solar is improving steadily, but it's still far off.

I'm not saying that we shouldn't reduce emissions of noxious combustion products, because there are other reasons that we should, cancer causing pollutants for one. On the worldwide scale there are natural sources of CO2 that dwarf mans emissions, which makes man made CO2 irrelevant. Evidence suggests that CO2 levels have been much higher in the past than it is now, and there is no evidence of a world wide catastrophic event for that time period. What is also erroneous is that CO2 has been made the scapegoat for which we can blame this so called problem of climate change, CO2 is not a pollutant, CO2 is required for life to exist, the most prevalent greenhouse gas is water vapor which accounts for 95% of the greenhouse effect.

I say this at the risk of sounding like a conspiracy theorist, but I believe that the UN is using this Climate Change lie to bring all the nations together to fight a common enemy, possibly to bring about the New World Order.

Conspiracy theories aside, the facts are 1, CO2 is not a pullutant, and is required for life, 2, dissolved ocean CO2, and volcanic eruptions plus various other natural sources make man made CO2 inconsequential, 3, World temps have been higher in the past, and we're still here, 4, Sea level rise not that big of a deal, people can move you know, 5, Solar radiation has greater effect on global temps than the greenhouse effect, 6, water vapor is a greater greenhouse gas than any other gas, 7, there has been no significant warming since 1998.

Lastly, yes, the climates changes no one said it doesn't, but it's not going to change so drastically that we can't adapt, and I agree that emissions should be reduced, but climate change is the wrong reason for doing so.",6.0,0.0,,1WKoj-kodBw,

2: ""The main natural carbon sinks are plants, the ocean and soil."" More CO2 mean more plants, more plants mean more breathable oxygen, more oxygen mean the overall CO2 percentage is offset by the increase in oxygen released by plants.
3: Did you know that the current warming phase began before the start of the industrial revolution, and after it started the temp lowered for a couple of decades, which sparked the ice age scare, before rising again. Clearly man made CO2 is not the culprit.
4: I didn't say it wouldn't be hard to move, but moving house isn't the end of the world either.
5: I didn't say Solar radiation was the cause, all I said was that it has a greater effect.
6: Yes I know the water cycle, and the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere is 2500 ppm, much more than the tiny 400 ppm of CO2. Water conducts heat 6 times faster that air, and holds more of it which is why high humidity makes the air temp feel hotter than it actually is.

1, CO2 will increase plant life, sure, at the expense of all other life. Just because water is required for life doesn't mean you should go down 10 litres of it. 
2, CO2 released naturally is counteracted by natural carbon sinks. Artificially released CO2 has no carbon sink to go along with it, so CO2 will rise. 
3, World temps have never risen this much in such a short amount of time. The rise in the past 50 years took place in what should be 3300 years. 
4, yep and when those people move, there will be destabilzation, and refugees along with that. I hope you can take a few in.

They are currently about as far fetched as intergalactic travel. We know that it is theoretically possible, but we have yet to create even a working prototype. All fusion reactors currently require way more energy than they produce, making them useless.

Global warming and the actions we can take to stop it are not cut and dry, settled issues  If Trump withdrawing from the climate agreement is as bad as you say, you must also take the following into account:
1. We might be in a hot solar cycle, and the rising temperatures could be a symptom of that.
2. If global warming is real, how much of it is man-made?
3. If a significant portion of global warming is man-made, then is it already irreversible?
4. If it is reversible, how would we stop the emissions?
5. Can we trust the inefficient bureaucratic UN and 195 countries with various degrees of dysfunctional governments to carry through such a formidable task?
6. How would the government phase out fossil fuels from every industry? Its not that easy, ask Germany that tried and failed. Enforcing a carbon tax would effectively mean poor people will not be able to afford energy and transportation.
7. If some countries effectively phase out fossil fuels, supply/demand considerations would dictate that OTHER opportunistic nations could get much richer if they keep on consuming them to develop their country, since fuels will become much, much cheaper. This would mean that the overall consumption of FF would still remain high, and the shift to green energy would be useless.
8. How is the shift to fossil fuels going to affect people economically?
9. How is the Paris accord going to help anywhere in this process? It's just like signing a petition, it doesn't actually do anything. Read it.
10. If we can figure out a way to stop CO2 emission, what's to stop other greenhouse gases like methane and NO2?

I like less pollution, I like protecting the environment, but that is secondary to my need for survival. You need to realize that fossil fuels are the greatest thing that ever happened to mankind. Without fossil fuels there would be no industrial revolution, no agricultural revolution, forget the IT revolution. Fossil fuels have helped lift innumerable people out of poverty.  Also, I'm gonna buy a Tesla as soon as Elon brings it to India. But you need to realize there is a lot of poverty still, and only rich people can afford environment-friendly technologies. If you try to force environmental technology on everyone, it would just make the poor poorer.  Like me, you should wait for it to become more affordable before trying to force it down everyone's throats. The free market and capitalism is a great way to do that.

How can you ask me to prove a negative i.e. the apocalypse is not going to happen? That's like asking me to prove that God or invisible fairies don't exist. The burden of proof is on you because you claimed we are heading towards Earth dying in a ball of fire.
Nothing apocalyptic is going to happen because you can't predict the future climate a hundred years from now,  I don't care which scientist claims that. Global Warming may prevent a coming Ice Age, which is long overdue and ironically end up saving humanity. You can never know the future.
 Also, humans are the most adaptable species in the planet except for cockroaches, that's why we are everywhere. Even if the average temperature rose to 60*Celsius, a lot of people would die, sure, but that happens now too, and humans would migrate to colder climate or come up with some technology to deal with it, or maybe go live on the moon..

How is that a contradiction? There is no proof because scientists haven't come up with a way to prove it. There is not enough evidence. All there is is correlation and hypotheses. That might count as something, but don't try to act like the science is settled and scientists know the exact dates of the apocalypse. And you know what must be done immediately to stop. The actual ""science"" in climate change is very vague and tends to provide very little information. The climate models constructed by scientists are unreliable at best, and are unable to predict hurricanes even moments before they are about to happen. Also, if you listened to environmentalists 10-20 years ago, everyone including Al Gore said that Florida and other coastal states like Mauritius would be underwater by 2016. This is nothing but mass hysteria.
I'm willing to grant you that there is man-made climate change. But climate change fanatics like you tend to exaggerate it way out of proportion, with no basis.

This is mostly because they are incredibly wasteful and inefficient to build, produce and run. These jobs can't survive without heavy subsidies. Those jobs are in fact being paid by other people's tax money and that's a net drain and increase the cost of energy substantially too even with subsidies. Worse, subsidies discourage companies from having to compete since they get paid handsome sums without needing to become efficient like other industries. Where subsidies exist historically, costs increase not decrease. As for BC in Canada, it's is like silicon valley north. Huge money piles in because it's a heavily favoured location to live, plus massive high tech, and China and lots of natural resources. Alberta (which was doing well due to oil and fracking) got hit heavy due to the drop in oil prices due to abundant supplied. Add in a hostile government against shale oil doesn't help at all for Alberta. Ontario has had a regressive government and implemented very expensive ""green"" energy causing electrical rates to skyrocket killing business and hurting the citizens. BC being better because the rest of the country got hurt is a cherry picked bad example! 2. *""Free market should decide""* Green technology pollutes too - badly. Windmills kill massive amount of birds (rare ones too) and causes heavy noise pollution. Hydro power floods massive amounts of area under water. Solar uses toxic elements. Green cars use toxic batteries. Nuclear is perhaps the best alternative but not without risks. This is a poor argument. 3. *""Chine and India""* - the point is the reductions made in North America will be washed out by other countries who will take advantage of our willingness to hobble ourselves while they have no intention of honouring their own commitments, ever. 4. *""help climate change""* no, it won't help; the reason why the artificial limits are bad is because it will force governments to put artificial limits on companies instead of allowing natural forces to work. Businesses and people already have incentive to reduce carbon use - it's called ""saving money"". There's a natural drive to push costs lower and use less energy more effectively without the need for government to enact heavy handed blunt policies. Instead of businesses doing what they would do naturally with good business practice, they instead waste money dealing with political red tape and non-business orientated ""one size fits all"" bad solutions by government. 5. *""it's politically unpopular""* - people care more about jobs when they can't take care of their family; If politicians mess up the economy badly in favour of a minor target set by elites who live in mansions jetting around the world, they will (hopefully) get booted out of office. And for good reason. Perhaps I'll start taking the celebrities and politicians more seriously when they actually act like there's a real emergency.

What rate do we charge for CO2? If the built-in planetary positive and negative feedback mechanisms only cause a minor change in over all temperature in the end do we charge as if CO2 a major polluter regardless? Do we charge a rate based on real world temperatures measured as they happen (or change in rate)? Do we charge based on raw satellite temperate data (which does not show warming), or on adjusted satellite temperatures date due to orbit (that do show warming but which may have incorrect biases/assumptions in those calculations)? What if the temperature would have gone up naturally anyway, do we blame it on CO2?

Do we blame the amount of a hurricane's damage because of CO2 or do we blame humans for expanding near susceptible areas and not paying their true risks of building because they know the government will always bail them out in a natural disaster? I've seen ridiculous things like earth quakes being blamed on CO2 and I wouldn't put it past politicians to factor that in too. There's a tendency within government to try to milk as much tax money as possible and this creates a perfect excuse to vilify and tax.

Unlike pollution in rivers and soil where we can force a company to pay for clean-up of an area, where does this tax go? Does it actually change the usage of CO2 to prevent the alarmist scenarios? If the tax rate is negligible relative to the cost of oil/gas, it won't curb consumption much. If its a major tax which might affect consumption, is it fair/reasonable amount relative to the unknown cost? Can we get all countries to agree to the same tax rate so that no country has an energy advantage to prevent corporate cheating? If not, what prevents industrial heavy using CO2 industrial processes from being moved to tax free areas to save on the tax and produce yet producing the same levels of CO2 thus negating the climate change affects?

I see far too often ""green"" being touted as magic free energy without talking about their dark sides by those that advocate it. It's not pure either.

The only thing that comes close to me saying that (and it's a big stretch and overly generous to your misrepresentation) is saying we do not know the impact of CO2 on the environment vs what would happen in naturally in cycles due to the positive/negative feedback mechanism that we don't fully comprehend.

""it'll mean some other country will reap the rewards for their investment while they gain nothing."" No it means other governments are willing to waste money on losing technologies that have no merit to ever have been invested (or will make businesses into rent seekers). Ideas that appear to be good ideas already will be funded by an easy risk/reward scenario.

Even if governments were theoretically investing in good ideas, that would still be a bad idea to let them do it. What happens is businesses end up tailoring themselves towards rent seeking from the government agencies instead of being the best business they can be and ensuring they are delivering a competitive solution. This makes businesses weakened, sloth-like, and subject to the whims of the political winds. Long term, it's a bad idea.

""US government spends the vast majority"". While I do believe defence of citizens is a legitimate function of government, let's assume it is horribly wasteful (and probably very true too).

They pick winners and losers based on not efficiency but on political rent seeking. Governments don't care if their investments are good bets or not. That's the problem. I'm not buying this argument at all.

I love how you quote a 2009 article about peak oil while since then many new and vast quantities of energy stores have been found since. Yes, one day likely will have peak oil/gas/coal (unless cheaper alternatives are found before we hit that point); but again, prices will control and weed out oil, gas and coal as it becomes less available. Scarce resources get expensive and cheaper alternatives flourish.

If you are trying to claim that ""green"" like solar and wind are so good that they are going to be market winners thus are deserving of investment then you are proving my point that government intervention is not needed. Industry would line up to fund these green projects because they would be profitable. If you know they are losers and that's why government is needed then you prove my point that they are wasting funds on bad ideas.

I don't want government interference wasting resources and tax money on losing technology. The market is perfectly capable of allocating investment resources appropriately based on real world risk and reward without the need for so-called government ""investment"". I do not support subsidies. Government is already heavily in debt with many real problems that could be better addressed more effectively than wasting on these ""green"" industries. If ""green"" is so good, they wouldn't need government help.

If environmental harm is happening, the businesses that cause the harm need to clean up their mess and bare the cost (be it traditional or green technology). I support that fully. But I don't see CO2 as being one anywhere near dangerous at the trace levels that exist and we truly don't know the level of impact of CO2 versus natural and normal planetary cycles. That science is no where near settled despite proclamations otherwise. Discussion on these topics should not be shut down but be welcomed by all so that we can all get closer to the truth rather than make this entirely political as it is now.

As for my preference oil vs green. You are wrong. I don't care. Well, that's not true. I'm the kind of person who would rescue a bug and not kill it because it's ugly. I'm skeptical of all these industries and they do need to be watched to ensure they are cleaning up their mess. I'm glad advocacy groups like the one you quoted are trying to keep them honest. But none of the technologies are a panacea of perfection environmentally, including ""green"". Please stop assuming my intentions when you don't know what's in my heart or mind.

""As for the argument that coal/oil/gas pollute. Of course they do. So do the green technologies."" The pollution from fossil fuels does far more harm than green technology. The materials being used to developed eco-friendly technology are contain less pollutants and are designed to minimize their own damage to the environment. The benefits of green technology far outweigh they harm they cause.

Its quite obvious the the impact cause by green technology is more manageable than impact from fossil fuels.

""Oil, gas, and coal are natural resources. Like all resources they are finite but economics already has a process to allocate those resources effectively - it's called ""price"". As resources become more scarce, their price rises to counter the demand. This invites competition to find a better and cheaper alternative energy production, or invites better use of existing energy (to save money).""

That makes absolutely no sense what-so-ever and you know it. The cost of extracting fossil fuel will eventually become more grater than the selling price of it. Its stupid to waste money on extracting scarce resources when there can be more profits made from extracting near limitless and more eco-freindly resources.

They are being propped up by government subsidy and mandate. More below on this point. If they were self sufficient and competitive, there'd be zero need for any government intervention at all as the markets would immediately shift to ""green"" without needing mandates to save money.

As for the argument that coal/oil/gas pollute. Of course they do. So do the green technologies as I've covered above. They require usage of many toxic materials (solar/batteries), kill birds (wind), flood areas under water (hydro), or have inherent risks (nuclear). None of the technologies really ""green"" in the pollution sense. They all have hidden costs. Worse, the delivery output is unstable (except nuclear and hydro) and intermittent. They are inefficient in their production of energy (except hydro and nuclear) requiring subsidies just to survive and produce little energy relative to their costs. Their are rules for dealing with pollution and sadly I've seen ""green"" get an undeserved ""pass"" from their own hidden pollutants.

Oil, gas, and coal are natural resources. Like all resources they are finite but economics already has a process to allocate those resources effectively - it's called ""price"". As resources become more scarce, their price rises to counter the demand. This invites competition to find a better and cheaper alternative energy production, or invites better use of existing energy (to save money). No government intervention is needed to do anything to cause this process to happen.

I'm against subsidies and artificial demand due to basic economics. Risk and reward are absolutely needed to kill off inefficient businesses and bad ideas and reward good ideas with more resources. Yes, markets aren't perfect but they do self correct (and faster with less interference). The energy sector is huge and growing. There's no shortage of demand. Anyone can come up with an idea. If it's good, people will fund it. If it's bad or unconvincing they won't. If the idea is funded but ends up being a bad one, its results do not meet expectations and the idea dies. This is needed to weed out the inefficient and the bad and allow the good to prosper.

Government mess with this process. They remove the risk by propping up industries that are wasteful. Instead of resources going after good ideas, they allow bad ideas that live longer. They also crowd out other good ideas that might emerge in favor of existing bad ideas that happen to be politically expedient or connected to those politically involved (rent seekers).

Innovation is a process of building upon science, technology and our understanding of the way the world works.

They just don't know. They don't fully understand all the positive and negative feedback loops. The predictions thus far of run away climate change have not panned out and the proverbial ""can"" has been kicked down the road. The correlation isn't even that strong, especially factored throughout history which had wide divergence between CO2 levels and temperature. There are plenty of people who disagree with the level of concern they have about climate change. Even where people do agree that it's a concern, there are still plenty of people who think government actions are non-effective and wasteful at best and counter productive at worst.

The best solutions need to be debated but debate is shut down. Anyone who disagrees in the slightest is labelled horrible ""denier"" and ostracized. That's not how science works (or shouldn't be). This is political. If the science is that strong on the side of pro-climate holocaust, those who are on the right side of history would easily trounce and make fools of the equivalent of flat-earthers of climate change. But - Nope, we can't have discussion even. That kind of attitude is exactly what makes me more skeptical of climate change. As for sources, everyone should check their sources. If the science is strong, there's no reason to shut down debate (or better just plain open discussions) because the war of ideas would be easily won by the side with the right ideas.

I'm not apt to believe mega rich celebrities and super rich politicians who run around as Chicken Little proclaiming ""the sky is falling"" while they fly private jets around the world and living between air conditioned mansions that could house an army.

People say they want to live ""green"" as most reasonable people don't want to live near polluted rivers and breath polluted air. But carbon isn't toxic at these current trace levels (and won't come close to the danger zone). Doubling and tripling a trace amount is still a trace amount. The impact of CO2 isn't well proven or fully understood on the environment at all. Lots of scare stories where politicians race to throw money at problems to ""virtue signal their good will using tax payer money"" but the hard data evidence as to what would have occurred naturally vs increased trace levels of CO2 is not established. Plus doubling CO2 does not double the absorption and reflection rate of infra-red. The ""heating"" not linear and the real danger is perceived to be the so-called positive feed back loops in the environment. However, most CO2 forecast projections don't account the range of planetary negative feedback loops that occur naturally with temperature and energy, nor are all the negative feedback mechanisms even understood.

As for real toxin pollution levels, over time ""green"" conditions have improved but they were already improving before government enacted laws to help. Businesses had existing incentives to appear more ""natural"" and ""friendly"" to the environment as a product's selling feature and because of positive brand perceptions.

Given hurricanes and natural disasters have been happening forever, exactly how much more damaging is the latest hurricane and would the damage had been significantly less if carbon was reduced by a small global % target? Yes, hurricanes are getting more costly in recent years (even factoring inflation) but that can be directly attributed to people building more and larger homes in areas known to experience natural disasters whereas the carbon dioxide ""damage"" is not well proven at all.

The earth is not some safe place that humans have made dangerous, it is a dangerous place that humans have made safer. Sure we could always pop up a few more solar panels but the manufacture and maintenance¬†of solar panels take energy, and solar is inconsistent so it takes a while to make that energy back, so in the meantime, fossil fuels are the only hope.

I don't think anyone expects to use fossil fuels for our primary source of energy indefinitely. eventually, we will switch to fusion, at which point we will literally be able to pull CO2 out of the air and convert it back into gasoline, essentially turning fossil fuels into batteries. but solar is NEVER going to be the dominant form of energy unless and until we literally start constructing a Dyson swarm.",6.0,1.0,,1WKoj-kodBw,

In 2 hours the sun provides the Earth with the same amount of energy we use globally in an entire year. That is more energy than we could dream of. Increasing the efficiency even slightly would mean huge returns on investment.
With your argument, you say we need cheaper energy so that we can cool people down to not die, and to do this you propose we use fossil fuels, which in turn heats the planet up more and so therefore we would need more energy again to cool people even more than before.

3) Punish those who have been successful longer??? by claiming they only do it through what you tell us to call ""polluting"" when it's not. That's a straw man argument if I've ever heard one!

Also, let's assume for a moment that I am indeed wrong (which would mean that the vast majority of scientists in all fields and disciplines are all simultaneously wrong as well, but never mind how absurdly unlikely that is).  If I am wrong, but due to my ""alarmism"" we, as a planet move towards sustainable energy.  What is it that we lose?  Pollution and negative side effects from using fossil fuels (e.g., smog induced asthma, poisoned water supplies from coal waste, et cetera), so even if my side of the argument on climate change is wrong, we still receive benefits to society and the economy as a whole.  Now, let's assume that I, and all the previously mentioned scientists are correct in our assumptions on climate change.  What are the things that could happen in these circumstances if we were to do nothing.  Well climate refugees would become a part of everyday life, multiple nations would be swallowed by rising sea levels, swathes of the USA would be under water including most of Florida, food supplies would be stretched to their limits as growing seasons would be thrown out of whack due to the acidification of the oceans and the overabundance of CO2 in the atmosphere, and it would basically spell the end of the world as we know it now.  Now, the effects of this wouldn't be fully felt until after we are both death (between 100-200 years from now), but do you not feel as though it is woefully irresponsible to leave something with the potential for this more cataclysm up to chance?

California had the smart money on solar and wind energy and the Tesla car, with a huge increase in new energy jobs for California. However backward leaning states, still trapped in the 19th century coal economy, didn't get any benefit. There was also a healthy dose of federal stimulus funding to grow that new economy, going preferentially to those states with innovative ideas, again excluding the midwestern states who were trapped in old ideas. I guess I can see how citizens of those states revolted, throwing a grenade at Washington when instead they should have been expanding horizons. The average blue collar worker had no control over most of those issues. A President who could spread some of that stimulus money more fairly might do the country a world of good, but don't expect it to come from a President who's support depends on angry, divisive thought.

The main problem I have with people regarding Paris agreement is that they seem to believe that free market doesn't work and that government subsidies towards green research and its subsequent implementation is the only way forward. This of course is nonsense because the cost of current technologies is astronomical as they're not very fleshed out and the implementation of them would be both unrealistic and crippling. Also, I believe that having a non binding treaty regarding environmental policy is problematic. With something like human rights even though it's not binding, most sane people can agree on a clear set of rules that pertain to everyone.

""The Paris Agreement is nonbinding, therefore it doesn't hurt anything to stay in it.""  Based on that, logic dictates it also doesn't hurt anything to pull out. The whole issue is irrelevant - a moot point. That one thing pretty much sinks the whole rest of the video; but the logical inconsistencies just mount up from there - such as positing the idea that markets -should- be fair.

Life is not fair and neither are market forces. To claim the economic playing field should be level is just ridiculous. Sans legislative interference, the best idea is going to win out eventually.  A cheaper ""good enough"" idea from a small entrant can market itself successfully and win out over a technically superior but cost prohibitive solution from a giant company. It's the reason that coal is already beginning to fall to the wayside through natural market forces as attention shifts to cheaper, clean burning natural gas and, slowly, to solar as its cost comes down to a competitive level. Any sports team can tell you that competitive activities and inherently unfair and that is what causes a competitor to strive to better himself. Level playing fields are an inherently communistic idea and it has been shown over and over to be fallacious. Government shouldn't be picking winners because they screw it up every time and simply introduce waste & inefficiency. Let natural competition decide.

China isn't a rich country. There are richer zones within it where a tiny amount of the population lives. Yes Shanghai, Chongqing or Chengdu aren't exactly poor regions. But the differential between such cities and the rest of the country is abyssmal. 
And while it might be true that more and more industry is moving to China, that is mostly due to the fact that they also produce for china. As example the German automobile industry sells around every 3rd car in China. While that might change in the future since China actually is going towards a ban of fossil fuel for automobiles if they continue their path. And also try to get away from coal.
Considering that the US would do well to actually embrace a lot of the benefits of renewable energy sources as those will eventually overtake fossil fuel and not investing in these technologies now can very well mean a dramatic depression in the future.

By the same token, western corporations would not have enjoyed the economies of scale from cheap labour and be nowhere near as successful either. Both economies are built upon each other which is why they are more economic partners than rivals. The only actual example of an economic rivalry is European protectionist policies against African food produce in the 90s. They are dealing with some of the consequences of greedily holding onto this wealth for decades. If you think China has somehow ""stolen"" American jobs, then you do not deserve to have those jobs because ""job theft"" does not exist in a free market. If you think the quality suffers because of no gov regulations of many standards (quite true in China), by all means try to start your own enterprise and convince the consumer to purchase your goods. Chances are you'll realise these asians are actually doing a fantastic job for the prices global consumers are paying for many products. In fact it's mostly western consumers who have benefited most from recent global changes. No one else enjoys anywhere near the living quality we do and we hardly do much real work these days. Count these blessings while they last. China and India will soon begin to take even more professional level jobs from the west and they will eventually create a more multipolar world.

Given the stance taken by the current administration, I find the agreement would be weakened if other smaller countries saw that the United States, one of the global powers, was not acting accord to the agreement; this would give rise to a sort of ""If they don't have to do it, neither do we"" mindset. Because of these things, I find that in the worldly scheme of things it might be positive that the United States did retract from the agreement since I doubt environmental policies were going to be placed anyways and that's why it might be a silver lining since other nations can see how unfavorably the United States is being looked at, and that in turn might lead to more nations wanting to take the agreement more seriously.",0.0,0.0,,1WKoj-kodBw,

My bias is entirely for the good of the planet and the protection of biodiversity. Lugging money at a problem that is pragmatic in nature isn't going to do anything unless there's an incentive. Which most of the world is lacking. The US hasn't even gotten around to using their garbage properly in comparison to many European countries, and much of the developing (and now partially booming) world is causing most of the problems through overpopulation and their industrial craze alongside its immense waste production and deforestation.

You manage to ignore any and all angles to better suit your narrative. It's pathetic considering the intellectual environment you're doing this in. Which is also why you completely ignore the fact that there is not enough proof that this isn't just a natural cycle of the planet.

I definitely don't agree with Veritasium when he¬†gives the fact that¬†the agreement is nonbinding and doesn't go into effect¬†until years and years later as a proper reason to stay in¬†the agreement?¬†That's like saying 'Yea well¬†just because you said you'd do it doesn't mean you have to,¬†so don't¬†do it but¬†keep saying you will because¬†that's better than admitting you decided you won't'. Seriously,¬†it is really annoying that people ignore that it is wrong to stay in an agreement because it is nonbinding so you don't¬†have to listen to it. 
Also, Veritasium kept saying that reducing carbon emissions doesn't effect GDP while at the same time using that as an excuse for¬†why China and India won't contribute to the agreement at all. That makes no sense. Also it is very unscientific to bring up an example like British Columbia, which your reference is a very brief Wikipedia article, and extrapolate the results of that to a much more different environment. And worse, you use that to conclude there isn't evidence that it hurts GDP and the economy when you do not touch on whatsoever that this only can happen in the long run AFTER it destroys ALL the jobs in one sector and strengthens another sector. But done in this way (large carbon taxes and regulations) makes it so that it really hurts the sectors today while only every very slowly bringing up the other sector. 
AND THE BIGGEST REASON TRUMP LEFT? The Paris agreement was a globalist agreement at the expense of his own nation. The U.S agreed to PAY other countries in order to help them cut their carbon emissions. Why can't the U.S just leave the agreement and do their own work to cut carbon emissions without¬†compensation the poorest 50 countries in¬†a nonbinding¬†agreement? 

And so you don't seem partisan and using this as a political propaganda video, don't leave out the fact Trump said in his speech that he would either want to renegotiate to get a better deal (and why is that so wrong? (and p.s can we talk about France saying that it is impossible to rejoin the Paris accords? Like really? I mean seriously its a non binding accord and you keep saying you guys are trying to make the world a better place, but screw the U.S for leaving if it wants to come back in and cut carbon emissions with us we'd rather not have them.? How can anyone listen to that and not just get pissed at how stupid they think we are not to notice that) ok but seriously go back to try to find the start of the sentence bc I'm just going to continue it after this) or forge ahead to enact climate friendly policies for the nation without the nonbinding agreement.

I know Veritasium won't respond to this. I know only 2 people will see this. I also know none of my points are actually covered by the media, and they employ 'moral superiority' of their view and the fact that people don't watch Trump's speech or look up the Paris Agreement themselves, and so without going into any detail they can accuse Trump of screwing over the world.

_""Let the Free Market decide what technologies take off ; what innovation happens.""_

**Facepalm**

Oh my gosh... this is, without a doubt, the absolutely stupidest idea i've heard all day. I'll summarize it in a nutshell for you : _""smart""_ technological development and the market, free or controlled, are *polar opposites*. They are as incompatible as human lungs with space vacuum.

You have to understand this : a market can only exist because demands exists. Without demands a market cannot exist. So a market cannot endorse ANY product (by extension, Technology) that, because of it's efficiency, can completely answer a demand. Otherwise it self-destruct.

 A concrete example is that of the _""tight pantyhose""_ conspiracy. In 1940, one of the biggest chemical company, DuPont, had created a new synthetic fiber, which was nylon. The first bach of this technologicaly advanced fiber were so sturdy that people could litteraly take pantyhouse made of off nylon, firmly tying them with a knot and using it as an improvised rope that could allow one car to tow another (albeit at reduced speed.) Also, they could take the weather and lasted for so long that, essentialy, all the women consumers of the time barely only needed to buy two of them (three max) and be settled *for life*. Consequently the company made an excellent initial profit in the first weeks of commercialisation but, as the months went on, it made less sales and reached a point where it was starting taking losses. Why ? Because they were no longer any consumers willing to buy their products. Why ? Because the first bach of pantyhouse made of nylon fiber were so great, women *didn't need to come back buying new ones*

So what did the company do ? It gathered it's workers, chemists and the likes, to re-work the formula and design of their nylon fiber so that, this time, it wasn't as sturdy as the first bach. The result ? A weaker pantyhose, more fragile, more susceptible to weather condition and oxydation. In essence a product that wasn't made to last as to force consumers to get back to buy them, securing the market over production/demands of them. A.K.A, *the technicians were TASKED with sabotaging their technology because it was too efficient to make a profit from it.*

And that's the critical part of the problem : Technology is anti-market *by default*. It looks forward being easy to produce and *easy to maintain and repair*. It's limitations are set by the rules of physics and that of the material universe, not of the monetary system and, by extension, the market, which are 100% arbitrarily set by humans. That means that an efficient technology *aim at lasting as long as possible and only to be replaced when undoubtly necessary*. But it never look toward either sabotage, waste or aiming at being purposefully inefficient - *which is the cornerstone of the market economy*.

¬§¬§¬§¬§

Long story short, the logic of the Market is that Scarcity is the motor for Prosperity and Wealth, while Abundance is the catalyst of Poverty and Ruin. But for Technology and, by extension, Nature, the logic is the complete opposite : Abundance is the motor for Prosperity and Wealth, while it is Scarcity that is the catalyst for Poverty and Ruin.

Both are, by principle, complete opposite. And as such, the logic behind _""letting the market decide which technology is the best for human""_ is the most irrationnal logic of all. Because a market will NEVER support a technology that is truly efficient and reliable, as it is based on a logic that disregard profit for the sake of efficiency - what a market DOESN'T DO.",0.0,0.0,,1WKoj-kodBw,

First, I understand why Trump declined. He is symbolically rejecting the move toward petty global ""agreement"" and not allowing the US to be nagged by the international community, especially on an issue he is personally against.

1. I live in BC. I get it, we need to reduce emissions. And our GDP remained stable despite a carbon tax. But GDP is not a measure of individual quality of life, and since our taxes went up, our energy prices went up, and even cost of living has gone up, we are functionally poorer because of it. Let's not pretend it's without faults here.

2. We should not be factoring the cost of the pollution into ""production,"" per se, because its effects are immeasurable in their entirety. Making the market truly fair would involve the government having a backbone and actually enforcing its anti-competition and liability laws so that certain polluting industries are not favoured and subsidized over others (automotive, coal, corn), and that real fines and responsibilities are actually issued to, not just the corporations that pollute, but the people who run them too (to the extent liability laws can apply).

3. Again, GDP is a poor metric to use for this, since the real benefits of growth are not necessarily enjoyed by the people of China and India. So in a way we're kinda just allowing the rich Chinese to get richer by building empty buildings and shopping malls. It's a bit silly too, that places that extract the raw materials, produce the goods, and dispose of the waste for the Western countries are not seen to be tied directly to the pollution of those Western countries.

4. This is why the Paris agreement is seen by many as basically just a circlejerk for the elite do-gooders who want to pretend that they can propose a ""step towards the solution"" while knowing full well that the real solution is going to involve intense technological innovation. The Paris agreement should be about throwing Trillions of dollars into energy research, not band-aiding the problem.

5. You are right on this. The majority of Americans appear to support government mandated regulation and taxation for polluters, even if this means higher taxes and higher energy prices for citizens. BC has done this. Most of us have mixed feelings about it in practice.

6. He's probably not trying to create a frenzy. He is objecting to an international cadre that is interested in making countries do what they want, even if that just means saying ""yeah, like, we'll totally do something to reduce our, like, CO2, or whatever."" Boy, what a meaningful ""accord."" It's surely not just polluting companies pandering to idiotic slacktivists who think this will really change the world.

For me, as a graduate student in statistics, with a BA in Physics and BS in mathematics, and after having read about 10 or 11 papers in the scientific literature throughout my academic career, I would say there is certainly more than enough evidence to, at the very least, conclude that it is more likely than not that CO2 emissions contribute in at least some way to the problem. Of course, one should always continuously be reevaluating  one's position, but as of right now there is enough evidence to reasonably suspect that the massive amount of CO2 we have put into the atmosphere is causing some of the effects we are observing. Being skeptical doesn't mean never accepting something - to be scientifically skeptical, one needs to go out and actually try to understand something, read papers, etc. before making a conclusion. We should all start with a skeptical position, and as we being to review the evidence, we should rightfully change that position. But, when there is good evidence presented, it is also the duty of any reasonable person to give more credence to the idea supported by evidence that said idea's complement.

I have studied the issue and the evidence is strong. That doesn't mean it's surely all scientific fact, and it doesn't mean my position cannot change. It simply means that, right now, the evidence is compelling. 

Honestly, as a scientist, I can say that virtually everybody I have talked to about the issue is appropriately skeptical. I think people often mistake 'media science' and 'social media science' for real science. The actual scientific community (well, again, only based on my experience... maybe I've just been lucky) doesn't just accept this stuff. The scientists that agree that humans are affecting the climate have done so only after a critical examination of the evidence.. that what scientists are supposed to do [again - in my experience, I can't speak for anyone outside my bubble of contacts]. 

Now, are there many people on places like YouTube and Facebook that say 'humans are causing climate change!"" without actually understanding the science? Hell yes. Are there people how agree with climate change simply because they have heard that 97% of scientists agree on it? Unfortunately, yes. Are they being appropriately skeptical? Not at all. Fortunately, becoming an actual scientist is much more rigorous. That's why, if you want to get a PhD, you need to spend 4 years, then about 5 more, learning tons of the fundamentals - physics, chemistry, biology, math, stats. You also need to spend hours in the lab and writing papers, perfecting the scientific method. Scientists are trained to be skeptical. I am not aware of any scientists that just believes global warming for no good reason - everyone I've ever met could explain the theory, and they also have an excellent understanding of the empirical data. 

Have  you seen scientists who do not do this? If you know scientists that buy into the theory without actually being able to make a good case for them, then those people should not be scientists.",8.0,1.0,,1WKoj-kodBw,

In your hypothetical, all is in fact fair. One company has cheaper products, the other has better PR (there is a balance).. The consumers decide which they prefer, the green planet vs the green wallet. The problem is that people on one side dislike the choice most people make, that is going for the cheaper product.

Also, pulling out of an non-binding agreement shouldn't be that a big of a deal. We still have the EPA, and the ability to govern ourselves. Our nation has done more than most as far as going green. I want to protect our planet, but I'm not interest in giving 3 billion dollars away for international redistribution. Why are american goals so much higher than that of other nations in the ""agreement""? We, as Americans, should decide what environmental protections we put in place. 

Granted, I know many will disagree, but there is no reason we can't leave the Paris agreement and still reduce our emissions.

 A) A few producers (P) are selling a product (G for ""goods"") to a bunch of consumers (C). The individual P may each have a different version of G, but they are all so alike - and, importantly, are all produced in pretty much the same manner - that we can call them the same thing.
 B) It turns out that, in the production process of G (could also be its consumption), some harm is done to a certain group of other people (O; in case of CO2 emissions, the rest of the population).
 C) P do not really care about the harm that is done to people other than them and neither do C.
 D) Because no one who has any control over the price of G (P and C, by means of respectively supply and demand; using the term ""control"" loosely) cares, the costs at the expense of O are not factored into the price of G.
 E) This makes for a kind of wealth transfer; at the expense of O, P gets to produce more and C gets to consume more, so they get more wealth.
 F) The government could choose to stop this wealth transfer entirely by just killing the entire market with certain regulations, such as forbidding certain things that P need from getting into the country (for some products, such measures are not very successful as it just forces the market underground, where no regulations at all can be applied).
 G) The government could also hack the system to favour another market that offers similar goods that do not impact O, be it by giving it a subsidy or instantiating official trademarks and raising public awareness.
 H) The final (and almost always the most wealth-efficient) way for the government to handle a situation like this, is to tax the product (more than standard product tax), so the costs of G for O are factored into the price of G.

Climate change initiatives like improving the fuel efficiency of vehicles, help almost everyone. Sure there is a small cost to car manufacturers but overall it saves the consumer & industries reliant on vehicular transport (which is most of them) money in the long run. The main economic cost is to fuel producing companies but since the USA is reliant on imported oil it would actually help reduce the USA's trade deficit & benefit the economy overall.

Another big initiative is investing in research & development of clean energy production which has direct short-term benefits to the economy - employing people in relatively high-paying jobs. As well as long-term economic benefits since when clean energy technology is more economical than fossil-fuels those countries which invested in the research will be poised to make a killing selling that tech to the countries who didn't - do you want the USA to be a future exporter or importer of green technology? Part of that investment requires scaling up production because of ""economies of scale"" so if your paying to produce the green-energy tech you might as well use it to supplement your current electricity grid.

A US specific green-initiative was subsidizing biofuels which helped raise the price of corn which benefited many US farmers. (Though this was somewhat misguided in terms of climate change because biofuels are not carbon-neutral). 

Really the only really costly green-initiative is carbon capture & storage. The research for this is an benefit to the economy but wide-spread implementation would be a drain on the economy just as garbage collection or anti-pollution program.

Carbon-taxes are really no different from any value-added tax in terms of effect on the economy, all they do is favour more ""green"" products whereas most value-added taxes only distinguish ""essential"" from ""luxury"" products.

PS If the estimated effect size on the climate is small that is only an argument for doing more (as Nicaragua argued) not for doing less as Trump plans to do.",0.0,1.0,,1WKoj-kodBw,

On that note, I have a few notes to your latest comment foxsloth. 

The forbes article you linked to, is 5 years old at this point, so a lot could have happened between then and now. Al Gore's TED talk is from 2016 for instance. An he described the lower than fossil fuel prices to be a recent thing. 

The study you linked to about the effects of the Paris agreement was made by Bjorn Lomborg, who is known to have been working with oil companies. I'm not saying that he's wrong in this instance but I wouldn't trust only his opinions. 
Also I think that many people would say that the Paris agreement is not enough, but the fact that almost all countries have agreed to something is what is historical.

What I've heard from most is that

1. Free Markets cannot be entirely free, which I agree with. But regulations should be limited to preventing total domination in a market, that is regulations should promote competition. Regs that detract from a competitive market, hinder market growth and increase product costs. While some of these negative regs may be important in protecting our environment, it is still important that we appreciate their significance. Not saying to get rid of green regs, just saying to watch out how far we go. 

2. People do not / can not research before they buy, or that PR isn't a significant factor in a 'free/open market', to which I disagree. Reasoning: Social media outlets, ""Eco friendly"" labels, and social backlash to unethical behavior are all things that promote ecologic scrutiny among the consumer pool. We see companies attacked on social media on all kinds of social levels.  And of course if company 2 was doing more for the environment than company 1, they'd surly advertise it as such. And if they didn't, well poor decisions should lead to failure. (not saying being eco is bad, but missing an opportunity to undermine your opponent is a poor move) 

3. The price of green energy is equal to or near equal to that of fossil fuel(natural gas). I understand this to be inaccurate in most cases.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2012/06/24/actual-energy-costs-are-driving-us-towards-a-natural-gas-nation/#2fcf7ec763dd

Windmills can be cheaper, but they cannot constantly provide power. 
Dams can be cheaper, assuming they last a long time and you have a source to build it upon. 

-My last thought counter point. Some studies show that ""the entirety of the Paris promises will reduce temperature rises by just 0.17¬∞C (0.306¬∞F) by 2100"". 

Study: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1758-5899.12295/full
Highlights of Study: http://www.lomborg.com/press-release-research-reveals-negligible-impact-of-paris-climate-promises

Is 0.17¬∞C worth making bad economic decisions? Not IMO, but I do believe that competitive green energy will come in time, and probably before anything catastrophic happens. Burdening our economy will not help our technological progress.

4477,UghXFHn3pson3ngCoAEC,UghXFHn3pson3ngCoAEC,2017-06-03T12:46:09Z,Jonathan Limm,"So here are a few bits from an economy textbook I found laying around, stitched together and rephrased in you should hopefully be able to follow (I will be summarising multiple chapters here, so it would be nothing to be ashamed of if you cannot):

""There are multiple ways to measure wealth, but in regards to a specific real-life market the only thing we can hope to measure is the wealth the consumers and the producer gain in terms of 
- for every consumer, the difference between what they would have wanted to pay for the product and the price of the product;
- for a producer, for every product the price of the products minus the costs of that specific product;
this method is commonly used by economists to measure the wealth a specific market generates, here is why it works:
- paying the exact amount one is prepared to pay for a product is the worst situation for a consumer in which they will buy the product, so if the price is any higher, they would not pay for the product, so anytime the price is lower than the price a consumer is prepared to pay, the consumer gains in wealth;
- if a producer would lose money when it makes and sells an extra product, it will not sell that product, so a producer will keep making products until it starts losing money on them - in the worst case scenario, it makes no money on any of them, so any situation better than that is gain.
    With this model, one can calculate that a monopoly or duopoly is less efficient (read ""wealth-generating"") than a market with a lot of producers, one can calculate that a market becomes less efficient when it is taxed (when counting in the money the government gains with the tax as part of the total wealth gain of that market), and a lot of other things about the efficiency of markets. However, does that latter example not seem a bit weird? It suggests that we would be better off without a government. 
    This is because, on a level higher than the individual market, there are a few problems with this representation of wealth:
- common goods: there are things that have no market for them, yet are needed, such as street lights, roads, parks, schools et cetera;
- positive external effects: some products do have a bit of a market, but the price does not account for wealth the product creates for people other than the producers and the consumers - examples include basically anything that is subsidised;
- negative external effects: some products take wealth away from people outside the market - cars are a great example of this, as they bring noise and stink to people living nearby busy roads, as well as emitting carbon-dioxide and a lot more that harms the environment.
    If these three problems did not exist, free markets would bring the most wealth to everyone. However, they do exist and to make sure its (or the world's) population is as wealthy as possible, a government (or a collection of governments) need(s) to pay common goods and subsidies for products with a positive external effect with tax money and tax products with negative external effects.""

I hope that clears up any misunderstandings of the extent to which free markets can handle stuff on its own and the extent to which the government needs to get involved when it comes to things like emissions. Sorry that it was 8 times as long as the average YouTube comment.",0.0,1.0,,1WKoj-kodBw,

It's simply this, if a business can occur a cost on you without your consent then it was an unfair business practice. It wasn't a free market unless that company has the liability of paying for your extra costs. If Walmart accidentally rams a truck into your house they have to replace your house. If they dump sewage into the water supply and a city down stream pays 2 million dollars to clean the water Walmart should be paying the 2 mil. If the US causes global harm then they should be on the hook for their economic share of the bill, just like if Walmart accidentally slammed your property. If we accidentally damage coastal regions or cause flooding inland or whatever then we should be on the hook for the whatever amount of the damage we caused.

Along these same lines is the exact reason we have the electoral college. Not every citizen is going to educate themselves on candidates running for office, thus it's better to let people educated in the matter make the decision. 

As for the EPA, didn't Trump cut about 1/3 of their funding? 

And I believe the saying ""give and receive"" holds some truth. Sure we would be contributing a significant amount of money, but what we could receive from that is practically invaluable. 

As for higher cost of living and fewer jobs... it may cost more to begin with, but as with any technology costs will lower significantly. And if heavy efforts to improve the technology (in this case on a GLOBAL scale) the costs would drop rapidly. Hell we already see that with basically two companies in the US (solar city/tesla). And this is only start up costs for consumers. Eventually solar panels and batteries will be so efficient that the common person wouldn't have to worry about any sort of electric bill. 

And for fewer jobs, that's perfect! Nobody wants to work. And with the improvement of technology (look at automotive companies) most all jobs will be replaced by machines/robots/computers. There is a time coming when so much of our ""work"" will be automated that it will not be necessary for somebody to work. (Look at the bill that was declined in Finland for a basic income). While that bill was declined, the idea is there and is/will be a necessity in the future.

1) The Paris Climate agreement was estimated to cost $12.1 trillion dollars. It's just another in a long line of attempts by leftists to money launder cash into their coffers. 
2) Everything that ""Global Warming/Climate Change scientists"" said was going to happen has NEVER happen. Remember Al Gore saying that we wouldn't have any polar ice caps left? The date for that has passed and we still have them. While the global temperature hasn't increased significantly since then, Al Gore's bank account balance certainly has. 
3) Carbon Dioxide is something plants require to breathe. More plants means more food. Or are you pro-starvation?
4) The Paris Climate agreement wasn't brought before Congress, which is required for treaties. Sure, ""environmentalists"" didn't care when Obama was exceeding his authority as President. But that tune has sure changed now that Trump's in office. 
5) The Earth has had higher concentrations of carbon dioxide in the past. It did not result in a ""greenhouse effect.""

(or, more accurately put, you assume everyone thinks as smartly as you do, but their motivations are perpendicularly structured)

The reason Trump et al. pulled out of the agreement was for cheap publicity points. 
It's not about rationality or facts, it's about perception.

Trump voters *feel* like they are being *forced* by others to do something. That something is against their interests (short-term, at least), and those others look down upon them.

Their rejection of the agreement has nothing to do with the agreement itself or with climate change (although that is what people claim). 
What it is really about is taking power back and feeling marginalized no longer. (Oh, and the desperate liberal reaction is definitely a bonus for them!)

Like you said in your video, it is non binding, so what's the point of it anyway. Why does it even matter the US left. There isn't much point to leaving then, but Trump saw what the plan was to cut back on American pollution, but not on other countries. While it doesn't actually do anything, it's important to send a message that the US isn't going to do all the work, and other countries should contribute. 

Think of it like this, someone asks you to sign a paper that states something you disagree with. By signing the paper, you are agreeing with what it says although you don't actually agree. You don't have to act on your word, but you are still signing the paper. 
Something else I want to say is that other countries and scientists would attack the US for not following through with the agreement anyway, so all Trump wants to do is enter back in on better terms, so none of that will happen. 

Fossil fuels are still more profitable. Investing in coal or oil is still much more profitable than solar panels or wind turbines. I wish cleaner energy was more practical. I want to save the earth as much as you, but I don't want to damage society in the process. People should start investing in cleaner sources of energy, but I'd rather do it in a more steady way where we don't damage the economy by making a carbon tax or something else that will damage the economy and completely destroy people's livelihoods. 

British Columbia didn't suffer from  a carbon tax because it has plenty of other Mines that mine other things, so they just shifted their focus and resources to get the other minerals. 

The market is fair. It's preposterous to make people pay up front for something like climate change when they're buying coal. I can see this working if you put the tax on the coal companies themselves. This accomplishes the same thing, the coal companies raise prices because of the taxes they're getting, but the companies could start redistributing their resources to do other things. It would be a much softer end to the coal industry, and a slower one, but a safer one economically. 
Also raising the prices on fossil fuels because of pollution just makes all energy more expensive. It would be better to find a way to make clean energy less expansive, not raise everything. I'm not an economist but the prices of a all of a singular type of good or service rising doesn't sound good to me.
 
China is more than capable of reducing emissions. Sure the US is number 1, but China is number 2. It's already developed quite a bit, and considering the pollution there is so awful, they are the ones who need to cut back the most. I know I already said that completely cutting the coal industry is bad, but if you want to do it anywhere, it should be in China and India, not the US. We should be looking at who is emitting the most right now, not who has emptied in the past because that already happened, and there's nothing we can do about it, but I'm pretty sure no US city ever looked as polluted as Beijing, or almost any other Chinese city. 

I completely agree the Paris agreement is a good starting point, but Trump wanted to control his own country's economy, and didn't want other nations dictating what he should do. He has said he wants to re enter the agreement on better terms, I don't see how this is a bad thing at all. 

Why would he exit out of it to piss off scientists. That actually makes no sense. Trump wouldn't do something like that for no purpose. Whether you agree with him or not, and I don't always either, he never makes such a big political move just to piss people off. I can't actually remember him doing anything to purposefully piss anyone of since he became president. Sure he was a little crazy during the campaign, but since his election he's settled down and been much more mature. If you still think he did this purely in spite, just go watch his speech on it, that should clear any confusion

Now if for some reason this doesn't get buried in the comments and people actually read it and respond to it, please make an actual argument, and don't just insult me. I don't care if you insult me, but do more than that. If I'm an idiot, tell me why.",0.0,0.0,,1WKoj-kodBw,

What a lot of younger people can't appreciate is the fact that scientists and environmentalists have been doomsaying for the better part of 60 years now. Not all of them have been, but a lot of the loudest one have. Initially, like any well educated person, people were skeptical. Over the years they never saw any real change in the environment, maybe scientists saw changes in some fields but your every day person didn't. So in their eyes their skepticism was warranted, and as the ""point of no"" return gets further and further down they stopped paying attention. It's in some ways comparable to the religious people who try to predict the day of rapture, we scoff at them every time another date rolls around and thus becomes the automatic response. This is why trying to pass environmental goals is so challenging, and to do so you need to undo the decades of damage from doomsaying early environmentalists and activists did. Not trying to say climate change deniers are right, but statistically neither are a lot of climate scientists or environmentalists.",0.0,0.0,,1WKoj-kodBw,

1. Cost to U.S. taxpayers. The direct cost to U.S. taxpayers of the Paris Climate Treaty and GCF is very high since former President Obama unilaterally pledged to give $3 billion dollars to the fund and has already sent hundreds of millions abroad.

2. Increased energy costs for U.S. consumers and businesses. If the Paris Climate Treaty moves forward, as does the accompanying regulations proffered under Obama, American consumers will see costs skyrocket. The costs of combined measures such as the Clean Power Plan and CAFE standards would amount to the same as a $30 per ton carbon tax, or $20 billion in annual costs. Household electricity costs are projected to increase up to 20%, and an average family of four would see total income loss of over $20,000.

3. Puts U.S. at a competitive disadvantage. This agreement will cost the U.S. an estimated 6.5 million jobs by 2040 and reduce GDP by over $2.5 trillion, putting the country at a huge disadvantage to countries like China, India, or Russia. Also, these countries, which are signers of the agreement, are allowed to increase or have no cap on their emissions of greenhouse gases. For instance China has asserted its emissions will ‚Äúpeak‚Äù around 2030 putting the U.S. economy at a severe economic disadvantage in the interim and moving forward.

4. Paris Climate Treaty will have negligible benefits to the environment. According to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which compiled the combined impacts of the various pledges under the Treaty, it found a global temperature reduction of 0.2 degrees Celsius by 2100.

5. The Paris Agreement is a Treaty and needs to be ratified by Senate. Since the Paris Agreement is a signed agreement between 195 countries for a similar goal it can be defined as a treaty and should be subject to a vote by the U.S. Senate. This is stated in Article 2, Section 2 of the United States Constitution where it says, ‚ÄúHe shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties.‚Äù",0.0,0.0,,1WKoj-kodBw,

Individual states are still working hard, as are various corporations. The federal government can't stop California from going green. The green tech industry will still be alive and well in the US, just maybe not as universal as it could be. And given that most individual US states have the economies of major countries in their own right, theres still plenty of reason to invest in the US's green tech industry.

On #3, I don't care what the US's historic output is. At the end of the day, if this is a global problem, the globe must work together. If China and India aren't going to contribute, then there is no reason to shoot ourselves in the foot. China and India have such a low GDP per capita that if we aren't going to target them until they catch up, then there is no point trying. 1/3 of the human race lives in those two countries (Compared to ~18% in all of Europe and North America combined). They /have/ to be held accountable as well. If we ignore them because they are still developing and if we continue to ignore them until they catch up... Basic math says they could produce twice the carbon emissions Europe and North America did just by virtue of the fact theres twice as many of them... Which would make the situation three times worse.

Yes, only <2% of ""Americans"" are from families who were here before 1600 or so. The ""sovereignty"" of those folks' tribal ""nations"" didn't turn out so well for them. You seem to love to cherry pick what part of ""sovereignty"" for what people on this planet you wish to apply that rule, and skip about 400 years of history of the formation of our ""independent nation"" of over 300 million now.     By the way, the 2 billion dollars the USA had committed to the Paris agreement amounts to about $9 per person over a 15 year period, a small price to pay for priming the pump in many developing"" nations"" to help keep their polluted  air and water out of our environment.  None other than the U.S. Department of Defense, (which spends over $500 BILLION a year), thinks that $2 billion is a sound investment, preventing or minimizing droughts, floods, mass migrations, starvation, and puppet regimes who exploit or starve or otherwise mistreat their citizenry, (think recent history Somalia and other African ""nations"" or in the now failed ""nation"" state of Syria). Spending $9 per American over 15 years sounds like a sound investment in prevention or minimizing more of these calamities in the world in the not too distant future.   You can repeat over and over again how we are ""independent nation states"" up until radical religious folks from somewhere fly our own planes into our own towers in NYC or into the Pentagon in DC.

My understanding is that it is essentially the third attempt at a world-wide environmental agreement that has been attempted in the last 20 years and it's the only one in which a majority of the world's countries actually agreed to something meaningful. Global agreements where individual countries have to injure themselves for the benefit of everyone else are obviously incredibly hard to arrange (that is why Paris was non binding - previous binding agreements were simply unenforceable).

The real harm done by leaving the agreement is it totally undermines any trust or confidence earned in the last few years of negotiations that any significant group of countries can come together and agree to tackle a worldwide problem. Why should any country enter agreements now we know their leaders won't respect their previously made obligations? It makes global politics significantly harder and is a huge step in the wrong direction.

Some have agreed to reduce it more than others due to the fact, that they either 1. Pollute more than other countries. 2. Have benefitted a lot more from their industrialisation than other countries who are still developing. 3. Have the resources to reduce it more since they are richer.

And since the US pollute much more than other countries, have benefitted much more from their industrialisation than say Nigeria and also is the richest country in the entire world, of course they also have an obligation to try to reduce it more than Nigeria, who is still developing. 

Furthemore the agreements is based on two premises. 1. We cannot solve the enviremental issue alone. ALL countries contribute to it so ALL or MOST have to reduce their carbon emissions. 2. We cannot force countries to reduce it if they don't want to. That is why the deal is so mild. Everyone has to agree, and we can't penalize countries who can't live up to their promise. HOWEVER by agreeing most countries actually follow this agreement, because they have given their word. Therefore it is an incredible important deal since countries actually pursue the goal, that has been set.

However since Trump now pulls-out means you unfortunately can't trust the US and their word, and China have now taken the leadership on this issue.

It would be important for us to sign this because it shows the we at least recognize the problem, which, if anything, is a good start. 

Also, refusing to sign the agreement shows a complete disregard to the actual climate change science, and not even caring enough to acknowledge that it is a problem and should be dealt with eventually.

https://insideclimatenews.org/news/04042017/solar-energy-wind-energy-renewables-jeffrey-tannenbaum-jigar-shah-donald-trump-climate-change

""Jigar Shah, cofounder and president of Generate Capital, is frustrated with what he sees as the media's doomsday coverage of the attack on clean energy by the Trump administration. *""This is fake drama,""* he said, referring to Trump's executive order. ""We've already won the battle. You should be covering renewables like you did with the dawn of fracking‚Äîas if this changes everything.""

The case for optimism is grounded in swelling private markets and technological advances that Tannenbaum and Shah believe are immune to U.S. government interference. They point out that more than 60 percent of new energy generation in 2016 was from wind and solar. And that was in a year when the United States put 26 new gigawatts online‚Äîthe largest addition since 2012‚Äîaccording to the United States Energy Information Administration. Shah said that, subtracting the energy being produced by fossil fuel plants retired last year, net new electricity generation was clean.""

Stop with the poltico videos Derek.  Conservatives ARE for clean renewable energy.  Just not at the sacrifice of more efficient cheaper... yet still relatively clean... energy production.

The final goal of the agreement is by the mid-21st century, there will be ZERO carbon emissions.  To get to that point, the coal plants which provide 40% of U.S. power would have to be shuttered and replaced or massively overhauled in just 30 years.  To do this, the Federal Government would have to create regulations that would become increasingly aggressive and have a two fold U.S. economic impact:

1. A direct impact on the ability for domestic energy companies to use existing domestic energy reserves (i.e. coal) as a source of production.  This drives up cost to utilize expensive green energy, and would result in job loss in prospecting and managing those resources.
2. An indirect impact on the U.S. consumer for energy.  If the Paris agreement was aggressively enacted in the U.S., power bills would soar for the average american as energy companies pass on these green energy costs to consumers.

It's a quite well known aspect of economics that energy costs are a big factor in the health of an economy.  Readily available and cheaper energy means... in a very basic concept... more work can be done for less money.  In terms of dollars and cents, everyone can power more of their machines for their businesses or get more profit from them, consumers can power their homes and appliances for less and spend money on other goods.

Another aspect of this agreement is that it coerces developed countries to funnel a large amount of money into developing countries to help prevent them from using more and more fossil fuels.  Note that China and India are considered 'developing' countries (which I believe is a political fraud).  So we are basically talking about the U.S. and Europe paying for the rest of the world's expensive green energy power.

Now... here's where that little *force* problem is with the agreement.  While Derek states the agreement isn't 'binding'... that's NOT completely true.

Article 13 creates a 'transparency network' that essentially oversees not only the progress of emission control of 'developed' countries, but also monitors the funds channeling into 'developing' countries.  Ergo... an international body will become a massive tax service.  Since there is NO SPECIFIC GUIDELINES OR REMEDY mentioned for failure of meeting  this body's expectations, the U.S. is opening itself to international sanctions, legal actions or more at the whim of a group of... whomever happens to wind up in this 'transparency network'.  This is extremely risky to U.S. interests, especially while we're *barely* recovering from an economic depression from the mid 2000s, and there are U.N. members that actively call for the destruction of the U.S..

So, in essence, this agreement is an attempt to funnel money out of the U.S. and undermine it's position... and this is justified because of a perception that the U.S. (and the West basically) 'caused' the climate change problem.  I don't care to deep dive those assertions... but safe to say this is politics on global scale, at it's worst.

It's non-binding. The US doesn't have to do anything under it, so it's meaningless, and if the US does do something under it, say sends money to third world countries to help them develop green energy, it's also non-binding to them, so they can just spend it something else. There's no audit trail. Also, it's only a sustainable economy that can drive green energy. Just giving them money won't make anything sustainable, it'll make them dependant on the US tax payer.

So this does nothing except occasionally guilt-trip the US by giving everyone else a stick to morally beat it with to try to shame it into giving wealth to other countries without an audit trail. What's the friggin' point of that? Actually, nevermind there not being a point - how can you not see why this is dangerous?

And yes, it's true that the world is moving towards green energy on its own, and you know what? That's fantastic, but politicians don't have to get involved with it. Just let investors do their thing and keep your nose out if it's going fine.

And honestly, the most extraordinary thing is all these far left-wing people now crying about the leaders of megacorporations no longer lobbying the president because of this, when they've explicitly been on the side of trying to remove the influence of big business from politics for ages. What kind of ridiculous hypocrisy is this?

Also, saying that reducing carbon emissions doesn't slow down the economy is flat out ridiculous. This is a triple-logical fallacy hattrick you've got going on there. It's logically counter-intuitive and there's no evidence, it's a generalisation based on a single observation, and it's correlation implying causation at the same time. So okay, there's one part of Canada that experienced this. So what?

At this point I'm 2 minutes into your video and I just can't go on. This is silly. I know you're smarter than this.

EDIT: Got to 3 minutes. You dismissed the free market as having solutions, because until now CO2 wasn't seen as a pollutant, which you then go on to admit that it isn't. But it is a problem, which is fair enough. So... we're all actors in the market, right? We see this stuff, and if enough of us don't like it, that'll send a signal to electricity firms that they should care about this to get a better brand - so they will!

What is the evidence for climate change? 

- we know about the greenhouse effect. CO2 absorbs infrared light and traps energy inside the atmosphere because of that. Very much like the glass in a greenhouse does. That's pretty much indisputable. Now ofc. the climate is a very complex process, so this alone doesn't prove global warming. BUT:

- the weather and CO2 records show that global temperature reacts to CO2 levels about as you'd expect 

- prehistoric data of CO2 levels and global temperature shows that these two strongly correlate

Now, you might argue that maybe the rise in temperature caused the rise in CO2, not the other way round. 

- the records show that multiple times in earth's history, large amounts of CO2 were released at once from geological activity. This was always followed by a rise in global temperature and also often by a mass extinction event. Today, no such geological event is happening, and data analysis shows that the rise in global CO2 nicely matches with human emissions. 

Overall, the evidence for an ongoing rise in global temperature caused by manmade CO2 is quite compelling, there's not much reasonable doubt. 

But what about those models? 

Now, first let me explain what these models are there for. They are not meant to ""prove"" climate change or to give a 100% correct prediction of the future. The models are  there to give an approximate estimation of what to expect. Many of these models are also tested against past climate data and have shown to be reasonably accurate. 

Now ofc. there's always debatable aspects within these models. How the parameters are chosen can be debated. If the simplifications made are justifiable is debatable. But all this doesn't say that the models are all bad and that climate change is wrong. It only means that we can't be entirely sure how accurate the quantitative predictions are (though overall, the models are relatively solid and the criticism often mixed with corporate marketing, within the oil/gas/coal lobby there's many who have interest in confusing the public on the matter.)

Let's put that in perspective the military budget per year is around 600 billion and will thanks to Trump probably even increased while the US spends only  like 70 billion on education. Considering that this is what the US can utilize on its own those shared 100 billion don't sound to much anymore. Also one should not forget that some of those 100 billion will come back again in form of sells into those markets buying technologies and know how hence also creating jobs in the USA. People get to hung up on those figures but never put them into perspective. It would be far more interesting to talk about how this money is spend than about the plain amount. 
Generally speaking this deal is a give and take and considering that the USA can still profit from this 100billion indirectly yet not pay into this development fond is the real unfairness with the withdraw.

It's not about 5 points, it's about understanding the issue at all possible angles. The issue with most of these kinds of arguments is the notion that you shouldn't consider the opposition because it's dumb. I think we should stay in the agreement, but that doesn't mean I'd turn down a reason to discuss an argument against it.

Regardless of the issue, discussion should always be encouraged and pursued. If this format doesn't fly with you, just present the agreement verbatim instead of presenting it through secondary sources.

If what you do with the money you borrow has a better payback than the interest on the loans then you are better off with the debt than without it.  You never want to pay off all your debt unless you have no investments that pay back more than the interest amount. As a country, if your loans are greater than your income you *can* get out of that by borrowing *more* as long as you make sure that you invest that money in something that pays back more than the interest rate on that loan.
And, of course, the US *always* has the ability to make investments that pay off better than the 2% they can borrow at.

Household debt is mostly a bad thing because it mostly goes toward things that do not earn money like a house or a car. Government debt is a good thing because it usually goes toward things that do earn money or reduce waste like R&D like infrastructure.

But let's imagine that this money is a gift that will never be paid back. Even if we don't receive the money back directly, we do still benefit from investing the money in this way. In my earlier analogy, we get the benefit of not having excrement piling up mere metres from our house and by helping our neighbour out we're much more likely to get some useful benefit out of him in the future, such as borrowing his lawn mower or having him babysit the kids.

In country terms, this means lowered pollution from those countries (which affects us because we live in the same atmosphere and eat the fish caught in their waters) and better trade because less waste at their end means cheaper products at our end.

We're not cutting off our own foot.  Reducing emtted CO2 doesn't have to hurt the GDP and Derek even supplied an example of BC where their GDP grew in line with the rest of Canada while they dropped their CO2 emissions by 20%.  There are lots of small scale examples of how this works, such as buying LEDs which cost 10x a normal light bulb but use 1/10th the electricity and last 30x longer before needing to be replaced.  After about 3 years, you have more money than you would if you didn't change.  Or a Tesla car, which costs 30% more than a similar car but costs $2 to drive 300 miles.  Payback time of 10 years for an average driver or 5 years for something like a taxi driver.  Or regenerative braking, which costs $1,000 but reduces your fuel usage by 20%. These measures are *good* for the economy and your own bank balance as well as being good for the environment.
Some measures might cost money, but we do what we can afford to do and some of them will be paid for by the ones that save us money.

I keep hearing about trillions of dollars being sent overseas but this is nonsense. Only $3 billion was ever pledged and it's in US dollars which means it all ends up being spent in the US on employing US people.  The contributions to the GCF are good for reducing unemployment in the US.

Exhaling CO2 is not a problem.  That CO2 all came from the atmosphere within the previous year or so and will all come back out again as new plants grow.  There's no change in the overall amount of CO2 in the atmosphere thanks to breathing. The problem is fossil fuels, which are made of Carbon trapped and buried millions of years ago.

I am actually from West Virginia, I grew up in a trailer park next to a coal washout slag. There are many such proposals, including building a national lab in the area, dedication other higher educational resources and such from some notable conservative thinkers. 

As to the cost, I absolutely agree the cost structure is bassakwards from an affordability standpoint. Paying 50k up front for a solar array, even if it was cheaper in the long run is just not a tenable option for nearly all Americans. That is why most wonks don't recommend such an approach and instead value placing a cost on carbon along with tax rebates for disadvantaged folks. We have the same problem in the nuclear world, even if we assume that given all the external damages nuclear was cheaper than other resources, the fact that all of its massive multi billion dollar costs are up front makes it a hard investment for utilities...even if total cost was cheaper...being answerable to shareholders and quick returns makes market solutions for climate difficult with current policy choices. 

Also, I don't agree with the claim that ""Obama"" was killing coal plants. Fracking and cheap gas has been, however, the same with nuclear. Many premature nuclear closures are directly related to cheap gas, same for coal. Other non-climate regulations have been the most problem for coal, but that is mostly to redress the damages they do to us all from air pollution.

You are forgetting that the one of the main people to Initiate the Paris agreement was Xi Jinping. Any agreement isn't completely non -binding. It is a agreement of togetherness.

It is about saying , Let us all agree there is a problem, let us all be together in solving this major issue we all have created. Yes, Usa is one of them biggest contributors. Why should USA back of from taking any responsibility when they haven't even cleaned 1/30th of the pollution they created ? An agreement is symbolic of agreeing and acknowledgement of a problem. Non-binding also implies, non binding to economy. Don't also forget that internally within usa trump is going to cut down on all Climate change and environmental spending to various american organisations.  This is clear indication that trump admin wants nothing to do with climate change and they would rather create Jobs.... labour jobs.... the jobs that are going to get automated in next 2 decades anyways. He isn't retraining the skill of the labour or preparing them for the age of automation and by reducing corporate taxes he is only pushing automation forward. Politics, science, sociology and demographic dynamics of a country are all interwoven together. If trump adminitration makes anti climate change policies, it will negatively impact the effort gone into climate change. Companies and people replying on government funding, government encouragement and sponsorship, their efforts are undermined, and if markets feel government doesn't back climate change efforts, there will be only so much that market will continue to support climate change. Also America doesn't do everything on its own. In this age of globalization, a small discovery in a poor Indian university may get used by a scientist in america to make some bigger discovery which would have been impossible without the smaller discovery. But that small discovery would have been only possible with US funding with its 100 billion dollar. And save 100billion for what? Military spending? Half of US military spending is useless.

China is a manufacturing powerhouse and and if that is the thing that enabled the US to become cleaner and cut back their emissions, then I see no reason why China can't do the same thing. They dont, because they choose not to, not because they can't. They don't care enough, but rather just dump most of the responsibility on the guy with the most money. That's not fair... I heard Derek talking a lot about ""fairness"" in this video. Why should the country with the most money be expected to contribute the most to this agreement if they're not the worst polluters?

And speaking of China and fairness, I seem to recall Derek made some example of a waste disposal company getting all the business because they are cheap, but they don't do it properly and thus harm the environment. That's not ""fair"" and doesn't allow the markets to be on a ""level playing field""... whatever that's supposed to mean. This is the same Derek Muller who manufactured his Snatoms in China because it was cheaper.... So in an effort to keep the cost of production as low as possible, he chose a company that probably pollutes the environment more than any company here on American soil... Now is that ""fair""?

But I still think the very first point is still the most damning... If this is a non-binding agreement, countries can set their own goals but no one really has to meet those goals and nothing really happens if you don't, then what's the big deal? He says why bother pullingnout, but why bother staying? If this agreement is really so subjective and essentially meaning, why freak out that Trump decided to back out?

Such agreements are basically analogous to political campaigns. In such campaigns a candidate makes certain promises and after being appointed to the respective position one can hold them accountable for following through their campaign promises or not. SO in context of climate change, it is necessary to hold people accountable because free market is greedy self interested and unfortunately, if we do not transcend the self interested nature and evolve as a society, we will drown in the we create. Historically, a lot of advanced civilizations have gotten destroyed because of becoming clumsy , ungrateful and overly reliant on their resources. It is a cycle we must break and science is a tool that will help us so. Evolution is the main objective and we must evolve to be different. We all live as if we shouldn't evolve. As if ""economics"" and 100 billion paper money, something of a human construct is more important than the marvelous construct of nature, quantum mechanics and the mysterious physics laws. That is arrogance and it will destroy us if we don't do something about it and an agreement just helps remember to be humble which is so very important.
Also a lot of American ingenuity is because of immigrants that could come to USA and be free to do whatever they wanted. Yes, that is correct , however the  the agreement isn't restricting any freedom of business. Many of trump's policies are in fact hindering freedom of business. Not taxing the rich is one of them. Why? Because monopoly doesn't allow for healthy competition and is deemed economically bad because then control of market is anyways within monopolists hand not giving room for free market to work the way it should work (hint- Apple inc) . 
Also your third point. It isn't hard to believe. pollution and population are 2 different things. The smogy places in china are because of high density  of people. Shanghai won't be same as some other province. Similar Mumbai would be different to other town in India. USA isn't as dense as China or India (has 3 times the size of India, and 1/4th of its population) . And its not just one countries turn. it is everyone's turn. Everyone has to see what they do. China and India also have to lessen their pollution, but if USA has the means to do better and help other countries do better then it shouldn't back out because the consequences ultimately will be for everyone to bear. If China is creating 2X polution and USA creating X pollution doesn't mean USA one, China go wear the Failure hat . Climate change will fk us all equally.

unfortunately in the US political tends to refer to your association / sympathies: Red or Blue, Conservative or Democrat?!

Politics used to aspire to balancing the protection of the indivual citizen's rights and duties with decisions aimed strengthening a common intrest, values or plans.

essentially politics is about the decision proces of groups of people and the subsequent results.

Democrats are so full of their own correctness, I've seen and read so many coherent, sometimes persuasive opinions showing the Reps why they're wrong and expect them to return to sanity.

Well the Republican Christians, Evangelicals etc have their absolutely certainty unexplainable Miracles is the way of their Lord.

That being said; In point number one, just because the rest of the world is doing something, doesn't necessarily make it a good thing. And as you've stated, the US is reducing carbon emissions and reaching that goal, do we need to be part of some sort of worldwide ""agreement"" to reduce carbon emissions? If the agreement is nonbinding and we will have another president by 2015 anyway, what's the big deal about pulling out of the agreement? Can't the next president jump back in?

Like I said, I don't know much about the agreement itself, but I think the United States is moving in the right direction as far as reducing pollution, and I don't see why we need to sign any sort of agreement to reach any goal. I also believe that this country has many brilliant minds that can help remove pollution without restricting the freedoms of businesses and people. That's partly why I'm studying chemical engineering in school. I want to solve the problem with American ingenuity.

Also I find it really hard to believe that the US has started the whole problem of excess carbon emissions and we're the worst contributor.

I draw a line in the sand where it concerns effectiveness. It is an observable fact, at least as far as such things can be certain, that a certain degree of inequality in a market economy leads to a greater productivity and growth overall. Thus, a socialist society should strive to implement the benefits of such a system so long as it is still acting in the interests of the average individual. I don't decry inequality in general. I am against exploitation, unnecessary suffering, and a lack of equity.

There are a few other benefits to a market economy, and to freedoms/rights in general, namely in how they improve individual happiness through a feeling of self-determinism. So generally if you can have a system with more rights that works comparably to a system with fewer, than you should opt for more rights because the individuals will be happier. A free market contains some of those forces, but it can also lead to exploitation, which ultimately reduces the choices some can make the the social mobility available to them, so a free market must be carefully balanced.

Free markets are not goals in themselves, but an effective tool that must be used with some careful thought. And in some ways, rights/freedoms are also tools that lead to happier lives, and not goals in and of themselves.

I get your analogy; a non-binding agreement that sets expectations can encourage action.
Still, it is concrete actions and policies that ultimately matter.

As it's non-binding, he very well could have agreed to it and not changed a thing in environmental policy. I very much believe that had he agreed, nothing would have changed. 
To the same point, the current president not agreeing to the Paris Climate Agreement also does not mean that the next president cannot enact environmentally friendly policies.

    a) not disputed by Liberals and
    b) said logic is already met.

Making the vetting process even more strict isn't exactly logical.

Well, ok.... there is exactly *one* immigration policy that can prevent terrorism completely and full-proof. That policy is to remove *all people* from area under consideration, the U.S.A. in this case, and not let anyone in again. No people means no terrorists, and therefore no terrorist attacks.

The problem with the left is you get offended by what you were expecting to be triggered by. So you don't actually listen to what was said. So this time I'll simplify it: The right is thrilled that Trump won because the alternative was Hillary. 

It's been proven that pretty much anybody can beat Hillary for President, with the probable exception of Jeb Bush. Obama beat her. Bernie Sanders beat her, but he had the nomination taken away from him. But Trump won the Republican primary and he beat her. Because, apparently, she was too clueless to realize that the Electoral College exists. Trump went after the Electoral College and won. If it hadn't existed, then he'd have gone after the Popular Vote like Hilary did, and he would have won that instead. 

And I believe the reason Trump won the primary was because everyone was expecting 2016 to be Hillary vs Jeb and nobody outside of Washington DC wanted that. I'm still glad Trump won. He's better than the alternative. The thing the right is upset about is how, even though Republicans control the White House and Congress, they're still letting the Democrats have their way with the budget.

Do you really think the right is thrilled that Trump won because he's Trump? Or that we're just breathing a huge sigh of relief about the bullet the country dodged that was Hillary? The right ALWAYS holds their candidates accountable. That's how Bill Clinton got elected. It's how the Democrats took over Congress in 2006. It's how Obama won both of his elections. The Republicans were ignoring their base, if not downright lying to it, and the base held them accountable by not voting for them. 

But yes I did generalize the left, and it's not stupid. It's an accurate characterization of how they've been acting since they found out Trump won the election. Remember the ""Disrupt J20"" ads blaming Trump's ""regime"" for things that were happening under the Obama administration?

Obama put America into the agreement unilaterally. If he actually cared about it he'd have run it through Congress. So now Trump's taken it out unilaterally. Maybe next election Democrats will run a candidate that knows the ELECTORAL COLLEGE exists and goes after it instead of the ""popular vote"". Then, if that candidate wins they can put America back into the agreement. 

Bonus evidence the agreement was bad: Under the Obama administration China had a higher GDP than America did. Yet the treaty defines China as a ""developing nation"" while America isn't.

The areas with the largest population of humans (like India and China) could probably already considered flexitarian, as animal products are still a luxury good there. If Europe and the US go flexitarian, and the level of wealth continues to rise in India and China, we might end up with no over all change in meat and dairy consumption.

I agree with you, though: the topic should be more openly discussed. Since, unlike with oil and gas, EVERY developed country has major companies that profit of it, there is lobby against bringing up this issue everywhere.

@Max Foster When I said it would be hardly possible to make a large percentage of the world population go vegan, I meant it in a 'hard to convince' way, not in a 'would not be able to live on a vegan diet' way. Reviewing data and looking at research is not what most people do, sadly. They look at their peer group, or listen to what their parents told them (who were just as uninformed), and run with that. Even people that like to call themselves sceptics get super religious as soon as meat consumption is criticized.

You're right. The ""sceptic community"" is full of semi-intelligent hacks that want to make a buck off roasting SJW and radical feminists. A channel I'm glad I found recently is ""Ask Yourself"".

I've been using one since 1978 (big mainframe, now they run on a laptop and they run orders of magnitude faster). Hydrocarbon's (hydrogen and carbon) properties are very well understood (CO2 has very interesting characteristics at the triple point). There are very few degrees of freedom to be concerned with yet the simulations can't predict a result accurate to 1¬∞C. Why would I expect anyone to be able to model  something as complex and varied as the atmosphere to that kind of accuracy? The sun and it's affects is part of the equation. Incredibly small perturbations can cause fairly large, unpredictable excursions from the expected results.  So for me, it's ""likely to be untrue"".

That means that if every person was in 2013 equally rich on average than they were in 2000, the wealth increased 16% just by population growth.
Now, the world's GDP per capita (in constant currency) increased from $7200 to $13100, an 82%
This means that not only we have more people, but they are more wealthy too on average.
As such, the total world's GDP increased from $43.6 trillions to $87.3 trillions, a 100% increase in just 13 years. Where did all this value or wealth came from. Evidently, we humans collectively have more money (in constant currency), so we could not have taken it from other humans because, well, there are no other humans. Value or wealth is not a zero-sum game. It can be created and destroyed.

An example of destruction of value. Try this: Get a $2000 bottle of the finest wine and a $2 bottle of the cheapest vinegar. Mix the content of the 2 bottles.

What's the average wealth multiplied by the population? Don't measure it in money because inflation and exchange rates distort everything. Now you have. Compared to 200 years ago, now we have 7 times more population and each person is much richer on average (measured in gallons of milk, kilos of bread, Honda Civics, Domino's large pepperoni pizza, tickets for the theater, airplane tickets, or Big Macs). When you do the multiplication (say world's GDP per capita in constant currency times the number of capita), humans have collectively dozens of time more wealth than 200 years ago.

There is a didactic example, oversimplified because it is didactic, of a closed economy (and the World is a closed economy) that increase the wealth of all its population in real terms (i.e. not by inflation).

In this hypothetical world, people loves bread an only bread. That's all they want and all they consume. Not only to satisfy their feeding needs, but also even if they had enough calories, they would still eat more bread (if they had) because that is the thing that makes them happy.

In this world there is one owner, and all the rest are employees of this one owner. The owner, of course, own the bread factory, but it is a real end-to-end factory. They prepare and bake the bread, but also prepare the flour, run the crops, develops and assembles their own machines (agricultural and industrial), etc.. So we have 1 owner and 99 employees. At full capacity in all fronts, the factory can make 100 kg of bread per day. The owner (unrealistically) keeps 1 kg of bread for himself and gives the other 99 kg to the 99 employees. But everybody wants more and, in the current state, the factory cannot make more. So the owner calls his best agricultural and industrial engineers and challenge them to double the production. The engineers request more land, an additional factory building, and more employees. But there simply are not more employees (all persons but the one owner are already employees of the factory). So more fields and more factory would make no sense if there are no more employees. Also, the owner points out that doubling the production and the number of employees would be stupid because then they will have twice as much bread to share among twice as many people, and that's not the idea because that would not increase the happiness of anybody. So the engineers go back to the drawing board. They develop transgenic wheat that doubles the yield. They also make direct seeding sowers and bigger and faster harvesters that let harvest twice as much in the same time and with the same crew. They create more efficient mills. An automatic kneading machine and a much faster continuous oven. All this lets the factory product twice as much bread with the same headcount and with the same work hours. Result? Now everybody has 2 kg of bread per day and everybody is much more happy. Nobody is receiving any less bread than before in order for these persons to receive twice the previous quantity.

In France, because of our avancement in nuclear tech and the ammount of resources we had (colonies, yay! ><)during the past century, we consider nuclear power as the future energy.
But what is done with it now is a mess. First, we've been producing radioactive products without even knowing what to do and how to store them safely.Secondly, we're pushing the limits of our reactors. Most of them were designed to be closed like 10 years (20 for some) ago. the older they get, the more dangerous they are. And pro-nuclear leaders don't seem to want to modernize those. Why ? Because of the cost. When a catastophy kick in, the damages are huge, and more devastating than whatever harm any green energy could ever cause.
So, thanks to financial reasons, we're heading toward a nuclear catastrophe.
Now, swiching from nuclear to wind energy won't be of any socio-economic arm at all. We do need nuclear engineers and technicians, because the dismatlement of the reactors will keep their job for at least a decade. And that's not even looking at the jobs needed to set up green energies. You need people to install it. For example, for offshore wind turbines, you need to build ships, harbours, and factories near the coast.
There are so many different solutions to produce green energy, but the funds are today to keep nuclear power plants kinda alive.

Biologically there are only 2 sexes, those with XX and XY genes.

And yes, psychologically one can identify as a different gender than one is physically, this is usually called within the field of science gender dysphoria. Some might call them transgender though.

Imperator did take into account that there are exceptions to the rule such as chromosomal disease.
Also, have you never taken an anatomy class? When he said that science agrees with him, it does.
There are only 2 sexes, there isn't really a 3rd sexual organ.

Also, do you really take lgbt and hrc as legit scientific sources? You might as well not have included them, your first source resembles a blog post more than anything. 

And why are you sourcing so much about transgender people? Trans people are still inside the realms of the ""2 genders"", they are just transitioning between them(hence the word trans in it), they still find themselves being a ""man"" or a ""woman"". If anything, you are just proving that there are only 2 actual genders.
In this discussion you should have posted sources to all kinds of weird genders people feel like, or wasn't there just anything to source about them? (except maybe like tumblr).

Also in your last argument, you are basically describing either very rare exceptions(chromosomal abnormalities etc) or again, trans people(which are within the realms of the 2 actual genders...). 
In your 5th link they also describe that these people undergo against their will forced surgeries and treatments. Wouldn't this indicate more or less that they are not anymore healthy because of fucking up their hormonal balances and possibly other things with that?
Also when you describe that the UN mentions ""do not fit the typical definitions for male or female bodies"", you know what these people are usually called? hermaphrodites, aka the chromosomal abnormality.

I also find it very interesting how not a single one of your sources has anything to do with fields of sciences, they are all just from rights activists.

*sigh* Incoming wall o' text

Imperator Caesar simply doesn't understand the difference between Biological Sex, Gender Identity and Gender Expression, which are all different things.[1]

I don't know where this guy got the idea that ""science has not and will never agree that there are more than two genders"", because if you do a little bit of research, you'll realise that psychologists and psychiatrists agree on the fact that not all people identify with a binary gender [2]

Most recent studies even show that the brain of transgender people actually show the neuron numbers of the gender they identify with in the limbic nucleus. [3][4]

And the reason why Gender is a social construct, is because society have ambiguous and arbitrary rules to determine Gender. Most of them assign gender at birth to ""one of two"" biological sexes, but, even if this  might be applied to a lot of people, the argument fails once you realise intersex people exist, people who possess any of several variations in sex characteristics including chromosomes, gonads, sex hormones, or genitals that, according to the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, _""do not fit the typical definitions for male or female bodies""_ [5][6]

The earth is sometimes cooling a bit due to the icy poles melting. Have you seen a timelaps of the north pole lately? But normaly even this small increase is normaly taking THOUSANDS of years, and hundreds of milions of people are allready affected by global warming. Like in Bangladesh. The mass of water that has raised the sealevels are calculated to all come from the poles. Coral reefs are dying due to the co2 getting in to the water and destroying the chemicals the corals and shell creatures are made of. Huge amounts of fish that we eat feed in those reefs. This data doesn't deny climate change at all. If you read it they have actually concluded that the data suports it. Just because some theories didn't conclude the same thing that space microwave detection tech does, doesn't mean that climate change isn't real or extremely fast. It might as well be that the satelite tech was wrong. Not the theories. Dude. Scientist bust their asses and wallets in trying to convince people something we allready certantlly know. Imagine if we could just shut up and use that money in developing sheap, easy and effective tech to battle climate change instead! Trump is much better than Hillary. No doubt.

I don't see your statements as fact, I see them as wild predictions of a slippery slope. Amount of treasure spent to curb a fraction of fraction of warming is likely an early waste of effort. Certainly a better understanding with a model that actually mimics reality is sorely needed.

Sure, the plants grow better, but what happens when Miami, Boston, New Orleans, Rio De Janeiro, and San Diego are underwater? Not to mention Tokyo, Shanghai, and Los Angeles. Lagos is also extremely susceptible. The CO2 warms up the atmosphere and by extension the ocean. The ocean expands (because water does that) and sea level rises. On top of this, ice on land (Greenland, Antarctica, glaciers) is melting and pouring into the ocean. This raises the sea level more. If we don't stop by 3.6 Celsius, plants begin to die, as well as all multicellular life as we know it. At about 5 C, there is no multicellular life on land anymore because it either dies or thirst, starvation, or drowning.

I'm sorry, but by the rules of logic, you cannot find a causation link where you haven't even proven there even is a correlation. I mean, the guy was elected months ago, and you're expecting him to have already affected the economy on a large, long-term scale ? Really ? People really seem to forget that the effects of a government's policies aren't magically seen moments after that government got here in the first place. Now, look at the state of the US economy before and after Obama, and maybe you can see some correlation (and, if you ask, yes, the economy did get better). As a matter of fact, some might argue that there is a direct causation link between the two. So, before anyone can say with confidence ""Trump is a succes"" (which really I think should never happen if Trump keeps being... Well, Trump. There's no other comparison I could find, really), just wait until he isn't president anymore, and a few decades later, when you will have gathered meaningful statistical data, you will probably realise how unsuccessful he will have been.

CO2 is one of these gases, known as a greenhouse gas. 

What that means is that these gases trap heat in the atmosphere, and when you burn hydrocarbons  (such as gasoline) co2 and water are emitted into the atmosphere.

What I'm getting at is that this is not just an observation that the climate is changing, there is a specific reason that it is. The amount of methane and CO2 that we put in the atmosphere is changing its composition.
