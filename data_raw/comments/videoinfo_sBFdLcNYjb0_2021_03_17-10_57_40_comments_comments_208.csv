1,Ugx8qtZMz_hb-lxcXl54AaABAg,1.0,18,2019-04-14 13:36:21,Tom Hall,Governments of all stripes will regress to a clever constructed theater of concern and commitment to assuage a restless public. Such is the COP process. The theatrical props and well rehearsed rhetoric are always less expensive than the real brick and mortar of systemic change. History has instructed that progress has been won in the streets then ratified by political institutions concerned with their own self interest as it aligns with practical reality. It is time to turn up the heat so that all may see the light. Thanks Dave.,UCg8S72qkYaGhEOgsDD_O7YA,0,Ugx8qtZMz_hb-lxcXl54AaABAg,sBFdLcNYjb0,2019-04-14 13:00:06

Capitalism = Greed = need for growth (including therefore population growth) = unlimited consumption of finite resources. Modern society (which ever system you want to choose) is just unsustainable. In my opinion, this problem is bigger than CO2 emission & climate change. Don’t get me wrong, we cant keep emitting CO2 as we are. But we will. Energy consumption is fundamental to capitalism and greed. No amount of renewable resources will make up for our insatiable energy & resource needs (food, minerals, oils, plastics, etc.). Although I applaud the kids for standing up, I doubt they understand the real implication for turning our lifestyles around. Will they for example give up: their phones - made out of heavy and rear metals, consume energy, large parts not recycled, made in foreign countries then shipped to where they needed, social media - needs energy and chemical metals (computers) to function, abundance of food & produce - mostly imported or transported over large distances, wrapped in plastic, responsible for large part of pollutants & deforestation, their reliance on cars (sure they don’t drive, but they also don’t like to walk, they ) holidays - driving, flying, encouraging more need for holiday accomodation in exotic places of natural beauty resulting in more destruction and need for resources. Easy & cheap entertainment - music bands, movie makers & stars traveling across the globe with enormous amount of equipment Changing fashion - to keep up with new trends and what their “influencers” & stars are “selling” to them Have children - yes this of controversial, but can we really sustain our current life styles and energy consumption if our population grows to 11 billion (Hans Grosling prediction based on each couple having 2 children)? Simple answer: No, they won’t give up any of the above, neither will their parents, nor their politicians. They need to understand the entire problem (it’s not just climate change). Climate change is link to a global economy. They need to take real action first - and no, protesting is not taking action, they themselves have to stop or massively reduce consumption, they need to question every action you take and look at what impact it has. Failing to do so and you are guilty of the same offences that the grownups, politicians and business capitalists make: that’s then just hypocrisy. It’s very easy to preach, make accusations that adults don’t take action - even though they are right. When they themselves do not take real action. Traveling by plane and staying in fancy hotels to make a speech to politicians about climate issues (whether you a kid or adult or Greta Thunberg) is just implicating yourself, showing how ignorant you are. You just become like them. What happened to video recorded messages or a life link. But no, we have to go to spread our “message” and take a stance. What they don’t realise, they are now part of the problem because no one can pass up the opportunity to be important or famous. You see, Greta Thunberg is a perfect example of this. She is massively inspirational in what she achieved and her ability to so eloquently speak in public. However (not to criticise her), in standing up for what she believes, she became a spoke person for children across the world, she receives recognition and one thing leads to another and before she knew it, she was traveling across the world, stays in fancy hotels, all paid for by the very people she criticises. It pains to say it, but fortunately she is also not mature enough to understand the implication of taking real action. Hopefully she will grow in her understanding of these issues, but the risk is she will get sucked in by fame and fortune in the name of standing up for climate change, she too will be consumed by capitalism and consumerism. Talk is cheap, protests are fun. They give a false sense of achievement. Giving up on our comforts and all consuming lifestyles is really really hard, even impossible.",UCk_Ffuu-FHqVeOpXmP5uroA,1,Ugx5Me3bbuQKZxABrpF4AaABAg,sBFdLcNYjb0,2019-04-14 13:00:06

But if you measure ecosystem change and greenhouse gases, and model the results of those changes, it's very obvious that the planet is much degraded in these terms, and that continuing to raise GHGs will produce increasingly serious effects. I guess you are a 'lukewarmer': you agree the Earth is warming but don't agree with the modelling showing that the effects of that will be pretty bad, potentially catastrophic, and eventually irreversible. The idea that just as many scientists agree with you as with the mainstream opinion that it is vital to stay below about 2C is frankly laughable at this point. The IPCC represents median, conservative, scientific opinion. There is a significant risk that things will turn out worse than that. The examples you give of people getting things wrong is not usually scientists, or is misrepresented as a prediction when in fact it was a worst-case possibility. Obviously there have been a few incorrect predictions by scientists, but they remain unusual and do not in any way undermine the mainstream. The 5-20 foot sea level rise is _by 2100_ not now, for example, unless you can find the paper or quote predicting that by 2020? I expect a similar caveat goes for your 'midwest desert' prediction example, but I don't know about that. You seem smart - I suggest you read the latest IPCC special report and see if you can see anything actually wrong or significantly disputed in there.",UCTxufSwjLrwXSFUgrmbe7rA,1,UgyyEkLpBGai-bvKIEF4AaABAg,sBFdLcNYjb0,2019-04-14 13:00:06

As you said yourself, there have been countless big predictions claim to be very true and needing immediate response to that turned out to be either nothing or the total opposite a short time later. Given the side and who are pushing what now I have zero trust in theri want and actions given they are also largely the same ones who got everything else wrong up to now as well. The real problem I see is its all manufactured fake urgency designed to deliberately wind up those like you who are not as willing to step out of your view of the world and take a cold hard look at things and how they have progressed through the years. That Fact is very little anything that happens today falls outside known past semi recent historical events in any area or action. The only anomaly is how the media and those with a agenda to push and over play their significance and meaning in the larger picture to drive the hyper reactionary over the edge more and more. Anomalous storms/weather events are statistically normal and to be expected. So much so that if they dont happen that's what should be raising alarms.

I do recall peak oil predictions being made and being wrong. I do remember the prediction we could not produce enough food and that, subsequently, being proven wrong via the Green Revolution (at least for now). Sure, I get why there is a lot of doubts about climate change and its eventual impacts too. But that's just it: climate change isn't a single prediction! It's a series of very serious interrelated predictions, each which might be catastrophic on their own and collectively which are nothing short of horrific. So are you suggesting the solution then is to ""wait and see"" if they are right on the most serious predictions? Then, I guess, if they are deal with it as it comes? I don't get that. Isn't the entire point of science to peer into the future via prediction rather than respond to the present so we can act before it's too late? You talk about a big conspiracy of journalists and social movements, but I place trust not in the protesters or writers of dystopian futures here. I don't care what they say. I place trust in the vast multitudes of scientists that are telling us that we are seeing NOW is exactly as predicted we would see in the beginning, and it'll get far worse if we don't respond now. For example, the globe is experiencing a very strong uptick of floods and fires worldwide as well as HEMISPHERIC-LEVEL heat waves! How can you doubt this as the reports pour in month after month? No matter if you think they are being exaggerated, these things are happening now and costing billions, and as they increase, just as predicted they will, you have to assume people will stop paying attention to those that, like yourself it seems, are saying let's wait and see.

I'd argue any field or organisation trying to make truth claims will eventually be undermined by someone intentionally or otherwise talking shite and then things will unravel badly from there, just because of the popular conception (which in some ways is necessary for important things like healthcare and not dumping toxic waste everywhere) of science as the ultimate arbiter on truth. From the BS about vaccines causing autism, the medicalisation of being gay, & the anti-transgender fake diagnosis ROGD (thankfully corrected or retracted by the respective journals, and retracted by the DSM in the case of gay folks, though the damage has been done already and continues to be done) back to the ""racial science"" of the transatlantic slave trade & Nazi Germany (& that sadly sees revival today in the modern Fascist movements), not to mention the ongoing mess that is the DSM medicalising anything it can think of. Of course, how could I forget the nonsense written about women, their wombs bouncing around their bodies, and vibrators being a treatment for hysteria (itself used as a justification for denying women the right to vote on the basis of their gender). Even if I appreciate the value of lived experience and 1st hand accounts in determining what's true (which honestly everyone should, unless you're going to start doubting that your mate had toast for breakfast), I wouldn't say I lack appreciation for scientific methodologies, or the discoveries that have made many folks lives easier, or the difficulty of the work of many scientists, or the difficulties they have in navigating and working in their respective fields (don't get me started on how academic publishing is essentially one big scam based on the unpaid labour of millions of hard working people that wouldn't have this problem if their practice wasn't run capitalistically); so in that way I would *like it* if the far left got to claim science as its own.

The climate system has to move into a worser state than what we're currently experiencing within the next decade or two regardless of the level of our actions to reduce what we're doing to the climate system. So big trouble is really just around the corner. I worry about the ""too little, too late"" possibility the point at which some already feel we've reached, but we haven't. With emergency action on the part of the world's highest greenhouse gas emitting countries, we could put a significant dent in the problem. The most modern, industrialized countries emit a disproportionate amount of CO2, Methane, and Nitrous Oxide heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere versus the rest of the world and obviously serious action on the part of these countries will make the most significant difference. So will we do it? I remain skeptical but not hopeless. I do believe the world will move to taking serious action to try to deal with Global Warming at some point in the future but that the point isn't likely to be in the next couple of years. So is it guaranteed to be ""too little, too late"" if we finally move into emergency mode say about a decade from now? Now it could be that but maybe not and the level to which we finally take mitigating actions on an emergency basis will largely determine whether or not we move down a path to eventually solve this most serious of all problems the world has ever faced.",UCylyH18s_ZlkJD0ADInds1g,1,UgwZCES1VaZ34MwHkOl4AaABAg,sBFdLcNYjb0,2019-04-14 13:00:06

At that point politicians will calmly explain how ""yes we can do that, but for that, we need to completely rob Africa and South America of everything they have and you can't think about any morals doing that (so basically we're gonna do what we did in the Columbus era, go there, steal everything, kill everybody).

Sure, sounds great: earth will be better off with less people (and by the way I fully agree with you). HOWEVER, we need to understand and be prepared for the full impact of negative growth. Decrease in population growth leads to decrease in economic growth, accompanied by a decrease in domestic demand accompanied by an increase in the number of persons who have been made redundant (increase in unemployment) and a risk of deepening social polarisation, which is reflected in a decrease in the countries GDP which results in reduced taxes for governments but a bigger demand for governments to provide social support to all the unemployed. No more growth = recession and a lengthy resign leads to a depression. And if you think that’s fun, go and look at what happened in the Great Depression of 1930’s. Also, look at the implications of a one child policy for China. Once you start having a majority of the population not able to work (due to age) and a decreasing population to support and provide for the ageing population, the economy comes to a halt.

Dyson says the relevant variables for predicting climate are numerous beyond what any climate model could ever represent, and so prediction is a farce. Dyson also says he doesn&#39;t understand why a scientist would pretend otherwise... but he doesn&#39;t want to impute motives to climate alarmists.

I hold to an understanding that your philosophical/theological worldview matters in a real way. If for instance, your deepest beliefs are acted out coherently, the resulting tragedy or flourishing of humanity, are indicative of the level of deception or truth that you place your basic assumptions on. The full title of Darwin’s most notable work, “On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life”, seems to me to be enormously overlooked today. I find a pretty logical and direct philosophical path from the ideas contained there to the great tragedies of the 20th century, as experienced under the fascist and communist regimes. Please note, I am not in any way holding Darwin responsible per se. I am just noting what seems like a logical and intellectually coherent pathway from Darwin’s full theory to those results and noting this as an anecdote. I don’t know what definition of evolution you would be using but I’ll assume that you mean unguided, materialistic, nothing to molecules to man evolution. I have told you that I am a Christian so you could probably deduct that I am skeptical about that. Obviously, even a theistic evolutionist would not believe in the unguided part of that if one insists on philosophical coherence. My perception is that “mainstream” science has not truly recovered from the ascent of the “Big Bang theory”, after all, going from infinity to even a billion or two years is a very big jump. As is going from a theoretical understanding of ‘protoplasm’ in the 19th century, to detailed understanding of the biochemical makeup of proteins and DNA. I definitely hold to the idea that life forms evolve and adapt (or die). We can clearly tell that things mutate and change, however it seems pretty obvious that it is much easier for organisms to gain ‘survivability’ by ‘losing’ genetic information than by gaining it. For instance, when humans adapted to more northern latitudes, they lost their melanin. I haven’t been able to find persuasive evidence of evolutionary mechanisms that are generative in nature rather than degenerative. Obviously I am not making an argument on the fact, “I can’t understand it so it must not exist”. :-) But as a matter of course, I don’t have that understanding. I would recommend a couple talks by James Tour on YT, and felt that he put the problems pretty well, if you like credentials :-) I’m not sure that accepting or rejecting either narrative makes a great deal of difference in how I/we address the problems and challenges we face so long as humanity maintains some basic understanding of the inherent value of individual humans and basic rights of freedom, including the right to be wrong.",UCdZyULIpen78vsgoXY0iTow,1,UgxKJg9DkZwH-9xt0aB4AaABAg,sBFdLcNYjb0,2019-04-14 13:00:06

I've found one source that refers to it (see below). But that's what I expect to find. If there was little or no impact to local SH weather in 1816, then it stands to reason that there would be little or no record of it. I've followed up by reading two different journals from Australia for 1815/1816. Nothing unusual seems to have befallen the colony due to the eruptions. I would not go so far as to claim that this is irrefutable proof - but I do stick by my contention that the 1816 results of the 1815 eruption were episodic and not global. I'm sorry to tell you, but there exists so much evidence, incontrovertible data, that indicates that CO2 is triggering Climate Change. So many reference articles exist, that I wouldn't know which sources to provide you as proof (although I'm inclined to believe you'd not take the time to review these). Perhaps your intent was to focus on whether there is a causal relationship between Catastrophic events and CO2. As you know the mainstream media would say yes. Many scientists, who years ago predicted that this would happen, would also concur. Others that aren't tied to past predictions, would also agree. Personally, as you well suspect, I'm also inclined to believe it is so. My impression, is not based on interpretation per se, but rather on the data; flood levels are easily measurable and data points go back a couple hundred years. Same thing goes for temperature highs/ lows. If these events were isolated or episodic, I'd agree that it's all just hyperbole. But the fact that nearly every country in the world has experienced 'record floods and/or droughts, record temp highs and lows'. Can these events be proven 100% to be due to CO2 induced climate change? I don't think so. As such, this admission would suggest that you are not wrong. The problem is that little in life is every black and white. Sometimes we have to go with 90% confidence levels. I've come across both Malthus and Erhlich, but have read neither of them. I wonder why you refer to them? As proof of incorrect predictions or perhaps the idea that surplus populations will be culled by lack of resources, etc? Since you agree that population at such numbers is staggering - would you not agree that such numbers would obviously cause harm to the planet generally and affect climate specifically?

Memory is something that seems to be becoming more important with time, when I went to check up on the temperature, the first search result was Wikipedia which gave the numbers you have, however I was able to find my original source, NCAR (National center for Atmospheric Research) gave the 3C temperature figure, NCARs later references to that event doesn’t give specific temperatures. Either way, my point was, that didn’t trigger a runaway cooling cycle. Even if the lower figures are correct, that is a huge change in that period of time. As far as that being a northern hemisphere only event, we simply don’t know, very few written records were being kept in the temperate zone of the SH. Plus they are 6 months off on their seasons, making it even more difficult to determine that. On the population question. Yes even a million people is a staggering number, let alone seven and a half billion. A couple observations. One I never argued that growing populations couldn’t or wouldn’t strain the global resources. My singular contention in this discussion is that we don’t have reliable evidence that elevated levels of CO2 are triggering/have triggered(?) runaway, catastrophic Global Warming. Two, have you heard of Thomas Malthus by chance? Or much more recently, the bet that Paul Ehrlich made? It looks as if the population is likely to top out at about 10,000,000,000 give or take a few. Also that is another argument for making sure we do nothing to impede access to affordable, abundant energy. If we have learned one thing, it is that when societies reach certain thresholds of wealth, for whatever reason, we get pop. to stabilize and even decline naturally.

Though there was another volcanic eruption in 1814 from another volcano that surely didn't help. The estimates I've seen for the impact on global average temperature were from 0.4 to 0.7°C (0.7-1.3°F). The average surface temp was said to be affected by about 1°C. Not sure where you got your info - perhaps recheck and/or cross-check. There's a HUGE difference between these figures and the 3° C you quoted, btw. Most importantly: you're using this example to somehow prove that such anomalies are short lived and natural. A bit more research will help you discover that though devastating to many countries, the so called Year Without Summer was a Northern Hemisphere issue. So as bad as the eruption was, it wasn't a global phenomenon. ACC is global. Every continent has been, is, and will continue to be affected. Strange to me that so skeptics never really account for the impact of the exponential growth of global population since pre-industrial times - an increase in 6 billion people within 250 years. Gary have you any conception how large a number one billion is, let alone 7.6 billion? I don't mean to condescend - for I myself can barely fathom the enormity of this number. How anybody can imagine that a completely unprecedented number such as this, would have ZERO impact on the globe, including affected climate staggers the mind. Add to that the insane number of large mammals - we've decimated the forests and jungles to house/feed - and you get some more billions of unprecedented critters and their impacts.

There was an interesting study after the 2012 storm in New York detailing how much worse the storm would have been if you raised sea surface temperature 2C. I think the science was perfectly reasonable theoretical science, the problem with it was that it never modeled the exact meteorological conditions that we would experience in that scenario. Why? Because it simply isn’t possible. The result is we know some cool things, but we didn’t learn anything of real value. The basic claim, that the so-called 97 percent of scientists believe, is that a very small increase in energy conservation causes by elevated levels of CO2 is a very believable claim. That increased level of temperature increases the level of water vapor in the air which has a much greater effect on warming than CO2. So far so good. The alarmists basically argue that water vapor feedback is the cause of runaway, one directional warming. My contention is that, that almost certainly cannot be true. If that were the case, an extraordinary active sunspot cycle, particularly combined with the Milankovitch cycle, combined with volcanic activity, would easily produce a short term global temperature increase that would have triggered this water vapor feedback. Another fun anomaly; Mt Tambora volcano in 1814 caused the ‘year without a summer’ across North America and Europe. It is estimated that the energy blocking effect of the aerosols from that eruption, lowered global temperature by about 3 degrees C. Yet the global temperature rather quickly recovered and things went back to normal. If you stop the narrative at the water vapor feedback, it sounds like you might have a case. But the huge unknown is cloud formation. You do need water vapor for cloud formation. Even further complicating it, is the fact not all clouds are equal. Some clouds, particularly nighttime clouds have an even greater warming effect, however, daytime clouds often have enormous cooling effects. Reality tends to cut both ways, normally you can safely discount voices that claim the evidence is all one way. So far I believe I have explained a fair bit more than you have about how climate is actually understood to work. That absolutely doesn’t mean I am on the right side of the argument, but I believe I have outlined a reasonable skepticism. I am a Christian, I believe in God. I understand that is an unfalsifiable claim. If catastrophic, Anthropogenic Global Warming is falsifiable according to your understanding, could you tell me how?",UCdZyULIpen78vsgoXY0iTow,1,UgxKJg9DkZwH-9xt0aB4AaABAg,sBFdLcNYjb0,2019-04-14 13:00:06

Many of the skeptics do. I'll explain later why I think it's the last thing we should be looking at. But first: (I THINK) that the first folks to raise the warning bell regarding Climate Change (Global Warming, back then) used sea level rise and discussed the end case scenario, did so to try to wake people up. Knowing that many of the largest urban/financial centres are on the coast and knowing that most people would understand this, they used Sea Level rise to try to 'personalize' the threat for them. Also, it's must easier to 'visualize' / imagine water rising & flooding and the damage it causes, than attempting to imagine and grasp the importance of air temperature increases. I think that they were alarmist in the sense that they used end-case to scare the people. I disagree with this approach and I think that Gore et al have regretted it. Catastrophic Sea Level rise will be the final result Gary. It'll be slow and increase exponentially. But by the time it does do the damage we foresee it'll be too late. NYC will start to be affected but only after many nations are annihilated (think Malta, Bangladesh). What we need to watch right now, is average global temp rise - both at the atmospheric level, ground level and sea temp., levels. These are what matter most. So if you focus on Sea Level - as the early proponents erring tried to get you to do - you lose focus of the more important first steps. YOUR QUESTIONS: I have question for you that I haven’t been able to get a satisfactory answer for so far. What is the ideal CO2 level for human flourishing. And what is the most ideal global temperature for the greatest human comfort? Why does not the climate scientists and all of their modeling tell us this? The issue Gary, is that I'm not sure there is such a thing. There are safe maximums, to be certain. And what I think you are driving at, is that humans are extremely adaptable. But as mentioned previously, for evolutionary adaptation to occur, things have to progress gradually. When changes (i.e. climate changes) occur dramatically, over a relatively short period of change, species don't have the time to adapt.   Now, to answer your question, in part: """"the threshold at which the human body is no longer able to cool itself and begins to overheat is a humidity level of 50% and a high heat of 46 °C (115 °F), as this would indicate a wet-bulb temperature of 35 °C (95 °F)."""" So if you live in a country where A/C is not available (due to unavailable power), once these temps hit, people die. And rather quickly. Just last summer, where I live, we had many deaths due to the heat waves. ""What's new? We've always had that."" True -and even more true before we had electricity and a/c for most people in developed world. What's unique is that these were regional events and now they will occur globally. And this will diminish life spans as well as life expectancy. Climate scientists don't model this Gary, for the obvious and facile reason, that this is not their job. They do climate. You need biologist for this. So, if you study biological evidence, you'll find your limits.... BUT But just for the sake of argument. Let's say that humans can withstand great variations. It's the agriculture that cannot. I've heard that there is a 4° 'optimum window' at which crops can yield maximally. So if it gets too hot/too cold, mass agricultural failure can & will occur. Does that mean that no plant will produce anything? No. But it means that yield will diminish to the point that we will not be able to sustain the 7+ Billion people on the planet. So, it's not so much what's comfortable for humans as what's more comfortable for the plants and insects and wildlife (pollination) to be able to exist.",UCMg72Gg1Q1nkUkgDomR__eg,1,UgxKJg9DkZwH-9xt0aB4AaABAg,sBFdLcNYjb0,2019-04-14 13:00:06

I find when you first interact with someone virtually, it comes easily and natural to throw insults and low resolution/dogmatic comments around, but after three or four exchanges, our brains seem to catch on that we are speaking with humans/individuals. We can all do better, and believe me, honey does attract more flies than vinegar as they say. I’ve certainly traded comments with more ‘abrasive’ folks than you. By a lot:-) It is somewhat likely I would be more persuadable if the early ‘alarmers’ would have led with more nuanced opinions, and then sort of casually threw out the more catastrophic possibilities. Gores movie and subsequent Nobel prize sort of put him and any climate scientists that didn’t call him out at the time in a pretty big credibility hole for me. Technically you are correct on what constitutes an ‘appeal to authority’, but I think about it like this, If what you think about science comes from the foundational ‘hard sciences’ such as mathematics and physics, then an appeal to a reputable scientist in such a discipline would not constitute a logical fallacy. However pointing to the hypothetical or predictive disciplines is begging the question. In other words if their predictions come true it’s not ‘appealing to authority’ if they are all wrong then it pretty much is a logical fallacy. If their predictions are pretty much coming true, then they are building credibility, if they are mostly either not coming true or if climatic conditions are largely falling inside of historic norms then it gets complicated. It is still pretty early on to form too harsh of judgement one way or another, as the arbitrary number I have heard used is, we need 30 years of data to constitute ‘climate’ direction. Shorter than that is ‘weather patterns’, not hanging my hat on that, but it sounds good enough for me. It seems to me that if the early believers would have been serious about CO2 emissions reduction, they would not have politicized the issue so much. If I was certain of a coming disaster, the first thing I would do would be to figure out how to communicate my concern in a nonpartisan way. The second would be to establish directional mile markers that would measure progress toward or away from the catastrophe. Of course I understand hindsight is 20/20 and the world would practically be a utopia if only I were in charge:-0 /sarc. But really the issue is not distinguishable from any other political hot button of the day. This last point especially is not evidence of anything, but I do have to wonder occasionally....

Gee thanks. I give you credit and I need to work on my approach. It's the damn latin blood coursing through my veins. In no particular order; Climate Change vs Global Warming. I'll share with you the reference that supports my view, that the former encompasses the later: """"Many people think of global warming and climate change as synonyms, but scientists prefer to use “climate change” when describing the complex shifts now affecting our planet’s weather and climate systems. Climate change encompasses not only rising average temperatures but also extreme weather events, shifting wildlife populations and habitats, rising seas, and a range of other impacts. All of these changes are emerging as humans continue to add heat-trapping greenhouse gases to the atmosphere."""" from:  https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/global-warming-effects/ I'm not gonna share another site I found that expressed it more like you see it. ;) So, in essence it's a moot point at best. Agree to differ on it. Naturally I dislike 'Global Warming' because in some places it'll be cooler. And the deniers and skeptics (a la trump not so long ago) like to (wrongly) scream out, ""Where's all that global warming?"" Appeals to Authority: My turn to tell you that I think you misunderstand this logic fallacy. An appeal to authority is when you ask another person to accept/believe (or you yourself believe) a person's point of view/stance/opinion/theory based not on data, observation or experimentation but solely on who they are relative to their societal standing, position or reputation. ""Well, John is the best butcher I know and he works in the freezer frequently, so when he tells me things in Antartica are just fine, I accept that."" But if, for example, you happen to accept James Hansen's statement that he is 99% sure that Climate Change is anthropogenic because he shows you the experiments he's done, the data he has collected and the observations he has made which he compared to other observations - this is NOT an appeal to authority. Which is the reason that I harp so much on ""data"", sources and references. True some people may not be able to understand all the data...but some of us, even if we're not climate scientists may be able to figure it out nonetheless. You've made some good points and asked interesting questions. I'll review, consider and respond later as I'm pressed for time.",UCMg72Gg1Q1nkUkgDomR__eg,1,UgxKJg9DkZwH-9xt0aB4AaABAg,sBFdLcNYjb0,2019-04-14 13:00:06

You say climate change encompasses global warming. As I understand it, global warming describes an average temperature increase of the Earth over time. Climate change describes how weather patterns will be affected around the globe as a result of that increase. I believe you got that backwards. I call it Global Warming because that is the overarching claim and somewhat more falsifiable/provable than say, we had a big storm and that was directly linked to global warming.

I was particularly puzzled by the link you gave me this time, sure hunger/poverty is increasing in some parts of the world, but that is a completely different thing from world food production declining. I keep up with USDA stats for that, according to their data US and global food productivity is definitely increasing. For some time now hunger has been due to political instability/distribution problems not production. I condescend on the 97 percent figure because of how misleading it is. The original study of peer reviewed literature made the claim that 97 percent of published climate scientists concluded that AGW from CO2 is very likely causing warming. I agree with that statement. The 97 percent do not necessarily make any claim about the severity or even whether it good or bad. You keep appealing to authority and wanting me to do likewise. I really don’t get that. It seems to me that if terrible, unparalleled catastrophe is unfolding before our very eyes, you wouldn’t need to appeal to authority. That is why I gave the sea level rise argument. That seems like a good indicator all sides agree on. Food production stats is another, we know the claims that are made by the alarmist. We can look at data from somewhat independent organizations. I am skeptical of the alarmists, you are skeptical of the skeptics. It seems as though we need to look at some (relatively) independent data to check evidence against. I point to the 1930s for two reasons. One, to continue to agree that regional/anecdotal evidence can be highly misleading. And two, to hypothesize how strong the emotional persuasion would be if such a weather pattern hit us right now, but in hindsight how terribly misleading it would have been. I have question for you that I haven’t been able to get a satisfactory answer for so far. What is the ideal CO2 level for human flourishing. And what is the most ideal global temperature for the greatest human comfort? Why does not the climate scientists and all of their modeling tell us this? And a bonus one. What level of hardship/adversity or convenience is the most conducive to human satisfaction and happiness?",UCdZyULIpen78vsgoXY0iTow,1,UgxKJg9DkZwH-9xt0aB4AaABAg,sBFdLcNYjb0,2019-04-14 13:00:06

Hold on to your straw hat my friend, for if you thought I was condescending before, you're about to feel even worse.  But first; it's climate change rather than global warming. The former encompasses the latter. In addition to what I perceive as close-mindedness, I'll say that I think you're little more than a contrarian. But let me first address why I find you close-minded, in case it's not apparent enough as it is. You agree that the vast majority of the world's scientist say that climate change is a major problem - and yet you suggest that it's of no import. Gary that you disagree with me, has nothing to do with why I find you close-minded. I find you close-minded because nothing touches you, no argument whether by me or the science community regarding the calamitous state we are in, seems to hold any value to you.  What's interesting to me Gary is that despite your obvious intelligence, you overlook a simple error in your reasoning. In your view, the primary reason for discounting these climate scientists is that they are humans, and humans have biases. And as such their interpretation of data is suspect due to their biases and human motives (I say this is your 'primary reasoning' 'cause you've mentioned it several times in your posts ... AND... you offer little else to counter the weight of scientific opinion). Gary, do you not see the irony and fallacy in your reasoning? Assuming you are human, then your bias and inherent human motives might be affecting your views. Maybe the scientific community is fine, but it's your bias that is getting in the way and stopping you from seeing what the rest of the world has seen. The dissenters in the climate science community are not nit-wits. But they can be wrong. But even that approach of yours lacks common sense (are you really a farmer?!?! Most farmers I know have rock solid common sense). Imagine one day that you wake up and feel horrible, zero energy. This persists and you decide to consult a doctor. He administers blood tests and an x-ray. He tells you, that it looks like you've got cancer. Being a skeptic, you decide to get a 2nd opinion...and a 3rd...and well you visit 100 doctors. 97 of them say, 'Yep, looks like cancer."" What are you gonna do Gary - you gonna follow the advice of the 3 that said you've got allergies? Or are you gonna say, ""well, the human body is really resilient, I've got anti-bodies..."" or are you gonna get the treatment that those 97 Dr's suggest? Contrarian. I tell you about the data and the climate science community - they're not honest or are biased. I tell you what about the majority of people, as polled. You say, ""ah, the masses, what do they know.' I tell you about million plus students marching - 'ah, they're just wanting a day out of class'. I tell you, just look outside - meaning, look at your own changing climate, you say, 'ah, that's foolish, what would I know.' If it walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck.... Contrarian. Ecosystems. There have been 5 global extinctions that we know of. Yes, ecosystems are resilient - until they aren't. How many references would you like me to provide you that will confirm that food production is down, globally due to climate change factors? I'll leave you with one, but I can provide you with umpteen.   ""New evidence in this year’s report highlights that beside conflicts, climate variability and extremes are also a key force behind the recent rise in global hunger. They are also one of the leading causes of severe food crises."" http://www.fao.org/state-of-food-security-nutrition/en/ Gary it was 'disastrous' in the US in the '30's. Major droughts. BUT, mostly just the US. The rest of the world didn't experience anything exceptional. The GLOBAL average was unaffected. The global average temperature has risen. Every year now, for the past 5 or so has seen record setting weather (heat, cold, floods, droughts) GLOBALLY. Your analogy is faulty. Gary - what are you credentials? What's your education like? What's your expertise in? Just curious.  Furthermore, it would be nice if you gave me something concrete to go on, regarding your dissension, aside from ""bias"" and ""this happened"" before. What are you afraid to tell me about your beliefs? Gary - I'm not very politic nor am I very PC. I could probably much less abrasive . But, I'm honest and sincere despite these failings.",UCMg72Gg1Q1nkUkgDomR__eg,1,UgxKJg9DkZwH-9xt0aB4AaABAg,sBFdLcNYjb0,2019-04-14 13:00:06

I am a farmer by trade, an industry that values broad general education/knowledge probably as much as or more than any other. Close minded? That’s probably the most condescending thing you have said so far. I don’t agree with you on the cost/benefits or severity of AGW, so I am close minded. A person could be pretty open mind in a lot of areas but close minded in a few, or you could be opposite. Who gets to decide what constitutes open mindedness;-) I, like the 97 percent of scientists believe that CO2 has a greenhouse effect, causing a small amount of temperature forcing, which causes an increase in evaporation rates, which causes higher levels of water vapor in the atmosphere which causes (relatively speaking)a significant amount of heat trapping. BTW, what kind of nitwits are the other 3 percent anyway? :-0 The fact that NASA feels the need to put such a meaningless statistic on their website does little to bolster their credibility. Just from a broad perspective of why I am not concerned about runaway GW, I am interested in ecosystems. One thing you learn pretty quickly is that they are quite resilient. Take the travesty that is our modern agriculture, try as we might we can’t completely destroy our food production ecosystems. In fact we are producing more than ever before, in the US and globally. (Sorry Al Gore,IPCC etc.) I see our planet as a kind of whole ecosystem. Ecosystems can have positive feedback loops, but they must have even stronger negative feedback loops or they would crash and burn. The fact we’re here suggest rather strongly that the climate system on Earth is fairly resilient as well. The reason I don’t post links is pretty simple, data and studies usually don’t mean all that much until they are interpreted by experts, that introduces the human factor into the discussion. The interpreters will usually go with one of two narratives. Our a priori assumptions will either be ‘confirmed’ or we’ll reject said interpreter as a bad faith actor. I wouldn’t say I only accept personal experience as valid, in fact, theoretically I believe the opposite, however if we had the large scale weather extremes that we had in the 1930s, I fear I would be tempted to go with personal experience plus the expert opinion. As we can see now that would be an erroneous approach. I guess you could see how anecdotes like that would play right now?? I do tend to be suspicious of narrative driven reporting, the aspect of every story that promotes warming is amplified, the aspects that would have a cooling effect are always diminished. Unless you are on the ‘denialist’ side. Then of course it tends to be the opposite. Personally I try follow those that try to evaluate all the evidence, regardless of which ‘side’ it supports. Another minor reason for skepticism, there are claims you can test yourself. Just the other week the Guardian ran a headline about glacial ice and Arctic ice that was ‘vanishing’. Sounds like Northern hemisphere ice would be on track to disappear in 5-10 years right? Except sea level is only rising .13 inches per year. Its enough ice in just Greenland to raise sea levels 25 feet. Can you really believe anything in that article? I do get frustrated trying to find honest brokers of information, but the reality is people are motivated by competing factors. The best you do is take notes see how particular people/organizations predictions change/disappear/come true. You say we don’t have time for that. I suppose we’ll just have to disagree.

But also clearly, I'm dealing with a person with a closed mind due to his politics or age. I also wonder if I'm not dealing with somebody that thinks he knows more than he actually does. But what is clear is that unlike myself, you offer nothing of substance - no sources, no references, no credentials - aside from the meanderings of your mind. Some say that wisdom is conferred on the aged. I've seen this is not necessarily always the case. We don't necessarily need to cut back 30% on our energy consumption. We need to change the source of that energy. Positing false dichotomies is the mark of a lazy mind Gary. I'm glad you like reliable affordable energy. What if we added renewable on top of that? And why not less polluting? Solar. Wind. Hydro. Yes, there will be some folks that may have to resort to nuclear, but it need not be everybody. You are right about one thing ....broken clocks? ;) ... the very same folks polled that said they were very worried and/or somewhat concerned about Climate Change, also said that they would refuse to disburse $10/ month if it meant it could help fight climate change. You'll laugh and nod your head here. I sigh and shake mine. The problem is that these people may not understand how grave the situation is. You don't see it either. But here's the catch, Gary, not just a few climate scientists, but thousands of them believe we are at the edge of a precipice. And it's folks like yourself that refuse to accept what is clear but that make educating others more challenging...and a longer process. Time which we may not have. School children. Yes, a fair amount might have walked out for the sheer pleasure of missing a day. But, surely you're not so jaded as to deny the worth of a number these young people who organize and fight vociferously for their lives. You farm. I like farmers. I taught farmers' kids for over 20 years. Farmers, though generally conservative, are hard working, no nonsense people. Charitable too. I wonder if you're a farmer and share these values - or perhaps you just dabble a bit. In any case, I'm guessing that you live somewhere near or above the 40th parallel and probably on the east rather than the west coast. I say this because if you lived below you'd be dreadfully worried right now. You're lucky that you've not noticed climate issues. As you'll see by the references below, it's a growing agricultural nightmare. Oh and Gary, sticking your head out the window is far from foolish. In fact, for somebody such as yourself that eschews scientists because they are all so dreadfully human, one would think that you're pretty much just relying on your own sense of things. Most of us older folks that have been around the better part of a century have no problems telling you that the weather patterns of the last few years are unlike anything we've seen before. It's not a ""one season"" anomaly. It's a year round one, for several years now. As to 'the masses'. For sure, people have always liked to talk in hyperboles. Today's sensationalistic media makes things worse. But what you don't mention is that we have loads of data that confirm: we're getting the hottest years on record, the largest daily rainfalls, the greatest financially costly disasters (floods / forest fires) we've ever had. Yes, we've always experienced floods, droughts, storms, heat waves and the like. But their frequency and severity all across the globe are unprecedented...and they were predicted.

We in the western world have mostly been a huge exception to the rule. The values that we adopt has a great deal to do with that. That is only a side point to me. As far as sticking my head out the window, number one, that is foolish. My anecdotal experience of local/regional weather tells me nothing about climate change. Number two, part of my living is from organic farming, so I am profoundly interested in local and regional weather patterns and have been for most of my life. The only climate change I see is in the newsrooms and some scientific forums/panels. The problem with all scientists is that they are people. They have world-views, biases, and motivational factors that effect their work. I love science, but that doesn’t mean I accept the work of a person just because of some credentials they have. I read the article you referred me to, I have seen that study referenced quite a few times. While I don’t consider it a particularly rigorous study, suppose the numbers given are an accurate representation of reality. So. Let’s cut back thirty percent of our global energy consumption and see how many premature deaths we have. Me and you could very well be among them. You accuse me of loving fossil fuels, you would be wrong. I love reliable, affordable energy and want more of the world to benefit from it as I do. I bring up nuclear because that is the only option that is proven, reliable, safe (per unit of energy produced) and carbon free. Bill Gates has concluded the same thing, BTW. Public opinion, ah what fun. People in the modern era have always been convinced that it is the hottest, coldest, wettest, driest, stormiest time in the history of the universe. You can find articles in the news as far back as our records go to prove that. Millions of schoolchildren skipped school to protest? Say it ain’t so! I would have hated so badly to miss a day of school when I was young:-) Do folks say yes when ask if they are for a “solution” that they are sure richer folks will have to pay for? Of course. The public barometer I believe is the most accurate is observing people’s behavior, they will tell you very clearly what they believe is important. I would think that Al Gore and his famous predictions, (ie, the Arctic ice cap melting by 2014-2018, polar bears going practically extinct) would wake you guys up to the ‘dangers’ of overhyping this stuff. If you are truly concerned, you are doing a good job of destroying your credibility. 10 years go past pretty quickly and some people will keep track of who was saying what.

You seem to be doing nothing but making vague conjectures. I don't figure you for an anthropologist.   AGM claims are not preposterous. Stick your head out a window, you'll notice things are not what they once were, in the recent and not so recent past.   As to the number of people dead as a result of Climate Change, the numbers vary from hundreds of thousands to millions per year. Personally, I don't think deaths due to fossil fuel pollution - which is awful - should be tied in directly to climate change, which is why I quoted the smaller numbers previously. I won't bother giving you dozens of sources to back up what I said, but I'll leave one. I know you'll ignore it as it doesn't fit in with your fossil fuel for breakfast world view, but perhaps an interested third party might come across this exchange and it would surely be refreshing to have real sources rather than off-the-cuff statements by who knows who, with who knows what kind of credentials. https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/global-warming-and-health/ Your claim that any development is dependant on 'fossil fuel & huge populations' is utterly ridiculous. We had locomotives without either. Many developments are possible without either. Me thinks you jump to Nuclear energy as you see it as yet another divisive issue, upon which you can choose to support the contentious side. It's like you know people aren't too keen on nuclear - rightfully so - and so you're setting up this false dichotomy to get people to choose between two equally poor options. I live in a place that does really well with Hydro Electricity; which I would choose any day before either. I'd choose solar and wind as well. But, I'm guessing you think that wind turbine noise causes cancer. Lastly as to the ""marginalized"" due to the very real fear posed to our species by climate change...well...over a million KIDS took to the streets to protest a few weeks ago. That's just kids. When millions protest for something, I don't quite think that you can consider them 'marginal' - even though you probably wish they were.   Not sure what your nationality is, but recent US polls suggest that the MAJORITY of Americans are either very worried about, or somewhat worried, about climate change. Here's a reference for you: http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/climate-change-in-the-american-mind-december-2018/2/ I'm guessing that deep down, you realize that you're the marginalized one.

That is a rather special set of assumptions I suspect we share. As far as fossil fuel caused, AGW driven, premature deaths go, that is a preposterous claim. The evidence is extremely shaky on that, however the evidence that utilizing fossil fuels has dramatically reduced premature deaths is quite the opposite. That claim is roughly equivalent to arguing any modern medical advances, (which we would not have without highly populated, fossil fuel driven economies) is bad because hundreds of thousands of patients worldwide have died ‘prematurely’ because of malpractice/medical mistakes, and must be stopped now!

Secondly, what you may believe about me or not, is of not particular relevance to me. What makes you think that I I share more values with you than I would with millions of others? I'm guessing that you're presuming that the millions of others would be people from developing nations. To keep things simple; I have concern for all things living. I try to live my life accordingly. But seeing as some people are careless or don't care about their own lives or the lives of others, I choose to be concerned for those that do. Just as a heads up. As humans WE all love and care for our children. WE all wish to avoid suffering. WE all wish to live with dignity. WE all want our own measure of freedom and success.

What exactly did they accomplish beyond giving up 100,000 school days worth of education to get some less than universally positively received PR attention? Say those same 100,000 kids take a day off from school and do a mass hands on cleanup effort in their community where they literally go around picking up garbage on the streets and ally ways an highway ditches and everywhere they can get access to. What did that do for the environment? My guess is take a 10,000 or more tons of trash out of their own local communities and ecosystems and do something measurable positive that many others will follow in doing as well. My point is, protesting is a useless moral feelgood bullshit show that doesn't do a damn thing but waste everyone's time on screaming and crying (and always leaving garbage fro someone else to clean up behind) about why nobody else is stepping up to solve the problems you want done, including yourself. fact is, getting the alarmists fat lazy proud ass out and actually picking garbage where nobody else is or has and it needs doing actually would accomplish something good everyone on all sides can see and measure that protesting would not.",UC1I6EfgJknhdtOfb85jas8g,1,UgzfQfb_oyxZsBSCJIN4AaABAg,sBFdLcNYjb0,2019-04-14 13:00:06
