Does oil and coal pollute you bet. It is way too expensive, we need a technology that gives us a Car that costs one dollar to go 500 miles, and is 5 minutes to charge back up. Problem One is that batteries will never do it. We need super capacitors. It can only happen with room temperature super conduction, Graphene doped with silver and boron. Then you need nuclear LFTRs to provide the 70% increase demand load on the grid. More than enough Thorium to last 5000 years until you perfect fusion, which the Ocean has a 1000000 year supply but look to the comets for more. Science people did you know that the CO2 levels were 10000 parts per million and the Earth was a big Ice Ball frozen at the Equator! What do you think the Limestone and marble is made out off? 4000 years ago how many grass eaters just in North America were putting out methane? Try 4.5billion, one herd of buffalo covered an entire state alone not to mention the deer, wild Rams etc. Number one polluter in the world is big agro. 50% of diesel goes into growing are food. Not to mention the energy that it takes to transport and refrigerate. We need 100 times more power clean and safe at 1/30 the cost. Yup we are almost there but the Elites of the world do not want that. 80% of the taxes paid all over the world are energy related. Governments make more money on oil than the oil companies do, and have no liabilities, that the oil companies do. Cheap clean energy is freedom. 23% of the cost of any product is energy, more or less. Solar and wind are energy transfers. Never get the power back that went into making them for solar unless used in space. I want that energy transfer on a boat, RV in the middle of no where, but will never generate the energy it cost to create(the glass,aluminum,silicon, silver, and then the wind Turbine with getting the rare Earths for the generator noise and bird kills) Energy is the real money! Science people not junk science, would love to have a debate with the fact that nuclear power has a million times more energy than a chemical bond. It is 24/7 cheap clean , not the water based reactors of today a LFTR look it up. Not enough rare Earths to create enough batteries to do 1/10th of what you are saying and would increase the cost of power by 200%. Nice for the governments to tax and make more money, no we need 100 times the power at 1/30th the cost. Solar can never be more than 50% efficient and again never make back the watts that go into making them, same with wind, also these systems have to be replaced every 25 years the pollution then trying to recycle them is catastrophic for the environment..",UChjKqDfktMPRd8UHfv-E3Ow,0,Ugy4QaVYsm9D-CB1zFx4AaABAg,DkZ7BJQupVA,2017-04-19 13:00:01

Sure, we can and should reduce electricity consumption, but a more important question is maybe: how can we convince companies and goverments to switch to renewable energy? Solar &amp; wind energy is already significantly cheaper than burning coal. <br /><br />However, going back to my first point, our BIGGEST problem is: what do we do with the other 80% of energy use? The use of fossil fuels is embedded in the way we move people and stuff (cars, airplanes, container ships), the things we eat (meat production is a huge contributor to climate change) and the products we use (plastics, concrete or steel for example). For most of these things we still have no clue how to transform these systems to sustainable ones. <br /><br />We need loads of research &amp; development, and loads of people who are concious of the enormous challenge we&#39;re facing.

We started making policies and laws in regards to climate change early enough that the problem seemed relatively fixable in a shorter time period, plus we got kids onboard a short time after, teaching about the dangers and effects of climate change. And while there are a lot of bad stuff, Ice caps and glaciers melting and potentially putting the entire country underwater, and the threat of entire species dying, causing the ecosystem to fall apart. But all of that could be tied down to a single thing. Greenhouse gasses, primarily carbon dioxide of course, which would come from fossil fuels like those used in our cars and power plants. So we saw a way to change it there. If we could switch entirely to green energy consumption, we could potentially save us all from destruction! We already had a head start thanks to investing in wind power following the oil crisis, so that definitely helped make the problem more approachable! Since then other issues have popped out, but we&#39;ve managed to get by, thanks to focusing on the core things I guess.",UCKv1PVUZYtnNn9E-vZDpapg,0,Ugww6G7rF5tdPPq5ppF4AaABAg,DkZ7BJQupVA,2017-04-19 13:00:01

It already is, to the wavelengths that CO2 can absorb. But it also re-emits, which means it is both ""black"" and ""white"" at the same time. Its warming power is the latency between these; how long can it hold a photon of energy? But most of the time near the surface it transfers the absorbed energy by collision with another molecule and consequently does not radiate. This is an important factor in warming. Conversely, at TOA (Top of Atmosphere), CO2 is free to radiate into space where other atmospheric molecules cannot. The result is CO2 cools the TOA, but warms the BOA (surface).

It suggest that people simply stopped using aerosol spay products and that solved the problem. The truth is that aerosol spray can use totally different propellants than they used to in the 1960s and early 70s. Back then they used CFCs, which some scientist attributed to causing the hole in the ozone layer. Those were banned a LONG time ago. Nowadays all aerosol spray cans use something totally different, usually propane or butane. These types of aerosol spray cans can't possibly do any damage to the ozone layer. So, you can use all the aerosol spray products you want and not be worried one bit that you are going to damage the ozone layer, unless you just happen to have a 60 year old can of hairspay that still works.",UCS-PsRZzsMB8zrYmx_I5o1g,1,UgxKaX7I0jgbFmdjuX94AaABAg,DkZ7BJQupVA,2017-04-19 13:00:01

Oceanic oxygen production is almost entirely consumed by oceanic life; just as terrestrial oxygen produced by trees and grasses is consumed by terrestrial life. Now if you are referring to oxygen containing minerals such as the White Cliffs of Dover, made of calcium carbonate, then perhaps the 90 percent makes some sense since for a very long time, billions of years, there was no terrestrial life and oxygen was actually a poisonous byproduct.

If you care about pollution, deforestation, or protection of the human health in general you would support solutions towards climate change because those solutions would also solve other problems as well. Cleaner air never hurt anybody, burning fossil fuels does. Also, it&#39;s not just using fossil fuels, it&#39;s using single use products, especially plastic. Not only does it create tons of waste unable to break down for thousands of years, the process of making it causes carbon emissions, causing air pollution and, whether you believe it or not, climate change. It&#39;s not some theory. You want proof? Look at history. London smog. Every country that industrialized early went through the problem of air pollution, and now with regulation it has subsided. Just because you don&#39;t feel the direct consequences of it doesn&#39;t mean that you can brush it off like it&#39;s some fairy tale. You can see it in front of your eyes in countries like China and Korea where micro dust is plaguing on the people.

Weather can vary in the short term, whereas climate is a gradual trend. Global warming does not mean that very cold days will just go away immediately and summers will always have days of searing heat. It does mean that those super cold days will gradually happen less and less and winters will grow more mild, and the heat of summer will kick in sooner. Also, natural disasters caused by weather will be more common. Look at 2020- California’s wildfire season has caused two catastrophes, one of which is still going on, Australia had a huge problem with wildfires, the Gulf Coast has been hit with two hurricanes and a tropical storm already this season, with so many storm systems forming that the Weather Service ran out of letters to name them with and had to resort to the Greek alphabet.

Climate Change is a natural phenomenon that has been happening since the start of time. Greenhouse gases Like Carbon Dioxide, Water Vapor, and Methane occur naturally in large abundance.

If anything the water cycle holds a lot more power on climate change than carbon dioxide does. Not to mention the many other greenhouse gasses that contribute to climate change.

Besides the CO2 produced by man made machines, there are over 7 billion people exhaling CO2 thousands of times per day. There are also billions upon billions of animals that exhaling CO2. There are also natural phenomenons such as volcanoes that release CO2. There is also the fact that CO2 is even the largest greenhouse gas. Water Vapor is. The reason that the condition of the world deteriorates is because of the Second Law of thermodynamics which says, “as one goes forward in time, the net entropy (degree of disorder) of any isolated or closed system will always increase (or at least stay the same).” This means as time increases the conditions of any object or even the earth itself will either remain the same or decrease. It will never improve. For example: If you leave a truck sitting out in a field for several years it will rust and not work anymore. The same thing will happen to the earth which is why inevitably it will be destroyed no matter what we do about it.",UCHv1r2sHQSQn6hFqI8Ji4DA,1,UgxwHo-SVZr5whiPQpx4AaABAg,DkZ7BJQupVA,2017-04-19 13:00:01

There are far too many highly complex disciplines and unpredictable parameters that effect climate, to be an expert or predict future levels, (as all the dubious computer models have failed to do). As a scientist myself (organic chemistry and biochemistry), *I deal in empirical data.* As such, I 'd say I'm not an expert but a *climate ""realist"".* I'm not chasing NGO, NASA, or institutional funding to pursue such career, so I dont create a problem, fudge data or propose a solution. To expect ""global average"" temperature to *NOT* rise or fall by 1 degree or sea levels by one cm or two over 100years is farcical!! That's assuming we can even measure such parameters accurately or meaningfully. Tide gauges for example, are subject to gravity and land movement etc. Earth's temperature varies between ~ -50C and +60C depending on *season, altitude, latitude, sunspot activity, atmospheric moisture, undersea volcanoes, ocean dipoles, tectonic plate movement, deforestation, urban island effects etc etc.* Moreover, the ""average"" temperature makes little attempt to consider data error or confidence limits, irregular placement of thermometers and accuracy of past empirical data. What really annoys me is when I see a graph with the Y axis showing a range of 1 to 2 degrees. Any small variation will appear to the novice, as an alarming vertical rise when it would be a virtual straight line if the full range of temperatures being measured are expressed.",UC6Jj_bNeDPyXW3F-Z3-jw2g,1,UgxwHo-SVZr5whiPQpx4AaABAg,DkZ7BJQupVA,2017-04-19 13:00:01

People in the third world have kids because they fear for themselves in the old age. Traveling can broaden your horizons (when not done in the touristy kind of way of visiting old buildings). The way to help is through political action. Vote with climate change in mind. Join a protest. It's not about us making the sacrifice. The people on top should.

Red Meat is, by our understanding, one of the healthiest things you can consume as a human. India is being noted as a large vegetarian country simply due to the lack of meat. They also have one of the highest starvation rates in the world. Poor example to support your claim. In addition, if we stopped feeding livestock all the food and crops that we do currently, and instead feed the people. Well I guess, with your idea, we will all just be eating grass and hay. Because that's literally the primary food source for livestock. I don't think you understand the idea behind multiplying food amount. You get things like grass, that humans simply can't consume and get nutrients from because our bodies can't break the cell walls of grass. Then you feed them to animals that can eat the grass, then proceed to harvest them. It's a rather simple idea. The world will not reduce hunger rates by reducing livestock amount, in fact doing that, will result in the complete opposite. We actually need more livestock than we currently have, in addition to better and faster exporting of said foods. Reduce global warming in other forms, not by removing livestock.

First, chlorofluorocarbons were scientifically proven to be the direct cause of destruction of ozone when radiation breaks up CFCs causing them to release chlorine atoms that steal an oxygen atom from ozone to form chlorine monoxide. This was not a &quot;scientific consensus&quot;, this was an empirically proven scientific _fact_. The fact is climate change is another beast entirely. We cannot prove with empirical data the exact cause-and-effect of carbon emissions on the climate model. Therefore, there is a scientific _consensus_. A consensus isn&#39;t fact, it&#39;s an agreement on an opinion.There&#39;s no data that suggests if all carbon emissions suddenly stop the climate will begin to cool. The climate has fluctuated for millions of years without our help. Is carbon emissions a bad thing for the planet? Absolutely. Pollution of any kind is not a great thing. But facts are facts, and we cannot prove with a high confidence % that X directly causes Y in terms of planetary climate. The scale is too massive, and the effort required on a global, multi-national scale to even make a measurable impact in atmospheric carbon levels is so high and expensive it just isn&#39;t feasible.

For those without Eumelanin (Black brown skin) the entire Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region makes their health weaken as the area is susceptible to some of the more severe consequences of global warming, including lethal heat waves, extensive drought and rising sea levels.Researchers at Germany&#39;s Max Planck Institute for Chemistry and the Cyprus Institute in Nicosia have found that the region – already incredibly hot in the summer – could become so warm that &quot;human habitability is compromised.&quot; temperatures could reach dangerous levels for human survivability.for caucasians the threshold is 35 degrees centigrade, for people without melanin&#39;s protection against UV radiation this only applies for the most able-bodied people. This means that white people with health problems, children and the elderly have a lower threshold for survivability.The clock is already ticking for those without melanin which is why scientists are spending millions trying to develop artificial melanin for those that can afford it.WHY?...Because global warming is melting the polar icecaps and melting the frozen soil beneath. Until recently, permafrost was not a major concern of climate scientists, because, as the name suggests, it was soil that stayed permanently frozen. But Arctic permafrost contains 1.8 trillion tons of carbon, more than twice as much as is currently suspended in the Earth’s atmosphere. When it thaws and is released, that carbon may evaporate as methane, which is 34 times as powerful a greenhouse-gas warming blanket as carbon dioxide when judged on the timescale of a century; when judged on the timescale of two decades, it is 86 times as powerful. In other words, we have, trapped in Arctic permafrost, twice as much carbon as is currently wrecking the atmosphere of the planet, all of it scheduled to be released at a date that keeps getting moved up, partially in the form of a gas that multiplies its warming power 86 times over.ALL people have melanin, with the exception of albinos - they have genetic mutation that does not allow for melanin synthesis.The difference is the type of melanin produced, mainly eumelanin and pheomelanin. There is also neuromelonin, but this doesn’t show up in physical appearance.<br />Eumelanin is what constitutes for brown pigments. Dark hair, brown eyes, tan or black skin. That’s the expression of eumelanin, and probably the type of melanin you are most familiar with.<br />Pheomelanin is what constitutes pink pigments. Red hair, light eyes, pasty and red-hued skin is the expression of a higher presence of pheomelanin. This is more common in people of Caucasian descent.Eumelanin has specific advantages as it is the norm for humans. black skin may enhance the body’s natural immune system and provide better protection against disease than white skin (Mackintosh, 2001). The melanin in dark skin is believed to help enhance the body’s natural ability to combat pathogens (Nosanchuk and Casadevall, 2006; Mackintosh, 2001; Manning et al, 2003).Eumelanin has also been implicated in the maintenance of calcium homeostasis (mechanism by which the body maintains adequate calcium levels) known to be involved with calcium ion regulation in the inner ear, which may improve hearing (Furuta et al, 1998; Norris et al, 2005; Nosanchuk and Casadevall 2003, 2006; William, 2007).melanin as it relates to hearing has also found that skin pigmentation reduces the effects of noise-induced temporary hearing loss. For example, empirical studies have shown that people with more skin pigmentation suffer significantly less temporary hearing loss than those with pale skin (Barrenäs and Lindgren, 1990; Maurer et al, 1999). In addition to this, melanin offers resistance to heat or cold, as well as resistance to the activity of inorganic antimicrobial compounds (Garcia-Rivera and Casadevall, 2001; Rosas and Casadevall, 1997) thus improving natural overall health. Which is why people believe tanning makes you appear healthier!darkly pigmented skin is at substantially lower risk of developing skin cancer than is fair skin (Agar and Young, 2005). In the U.S., Also some forms of skin cancer are “50 times” higher in Caucasians than in African Americans, and African Americans have a 13-fold lower incidence of melanoma than do Caucasians (Tadokoro et al, 2003). Melanin also acts as a free radical scavenger and has been shown to protect against Cryptococcus neoformans; this is a parasite of the central nervous system (Curie &amp; Casadevall, 1994; Mitchell &amp; Perfect, 1995). Interestingly, it is known that Caucasians suffer from heightened rates of many diseases that affect the central nervous system. For example, Huntington’s disease, optic neuritis, Parkinson’s disease, Multiple Sclerosis, PKU (Phenylketonuria), Anencephaly and Spinal bifida (Bates et al, 2002; Okano et al, 1990; Tanner et al, 1996; Nelson et al, 1997; Modi et at, 2001; Kurtzke, 1979; Alan, 2003). While there may not be any ‘direct’ relationship between melanin levels and these particular neurodegenerative conditions, it should be noted that (eu)melanin is believed to protect folate and folic acid (Jablonski and Chaplin, 2000; Branda and Eaton, 1978). These are essential vitamins that are particularly important for neural tube development in the unborn (Vorobey et al, 2006; Jablonski and Chaplin, 2000). Depleted levels of these vitamins are caused by UV light exposure (Vorobey et al, 2006; Lapunzina, 2006; Branda and Eaton, 1978), which Caucasians are particularly susceptible (Jablonski and Chaplin, 2000). Depleted levels of these vitamins have been linked to a variety of different birth defects including ‘spinal bifida’ and ‘anencephaly’ (brain malformation). Research has also shown that melanin is actually not a sunscreen , against UVB radiation but absorbs and utilizes it (Mackintosh, 2001; Hill, 1992; Scheibner et al., 1986).In fact the study of melanin was the basis for breakthroughs in computer science!Lighter skin has less melanin and what is produced is typically found arranged in clusters of melanosomes in keratinocytes, while darker skin has more melanin and the melanosomes are distributed individually in keratinocytes, thus absorbing light more efficiently (Miyamura, 2006).<br />Caucasian people, while producing overall lower levels of melanin (Tadokoro et al., 2003; Miyamura, 2006), have also been shown to possess higher concentrations of a more deleterious form of melanin known as “Pheomelanin.” The kind of melanin that helps to cause blonde and red hair (blue and green eyes) also increases the potential for cell death! Pheomelanin filters out UV radiation, but it also increases UV harmful effects and causes cell death, particularly when the melanin is the kind found in light hair or skin (Brash et al., 2004; Maresca, 2006). Melanin plays important roles in vision. Norris et al (2005) show that melanin acts like a neutralizing sponge inside cells in the retina to soak up and destroy reactive oxygen species. Reactive oxygen species, or free radicals, which are energized by light, are thought to play a major role in “macular degeneration”, the leading cause of blindness in people over the age of 60. The disorder is more prevalent among whites than among African-Americans (Evans, 2003; Norris et al, 2005; Klein et al, 1999). The disorder is also found in higher frequencies among people with light eyes than people with dark eyes (Nicolas et al, 2003).Although African Americans (6.6%) were found in a longitudinal study to have slightly higher rates of myopia (near sightedness), not significantly different from white Americans (4.4%), Asians were shown to have the highest prevalence (18.5%), followed by Hispanics (13.2%) (Kleinstein et al, 2005). For hyperopia, whites have the highest prevalences (19.3%), followed by Hispanics (12.7%). Asians were shown to have the lowest prevalence of hyperopia (6.3%) and were not significantly different from African Americans (6.4%).",UCcxRnnsdGekXLq2vJmdUdbA,0,Ugx5TxkOa3RdWGDAN2x4AaABAg,DkZ7BJQupVA,2017-04-19 13:00:01

It severely glosses over our food choices having a major impact on climate change, specifically how animal agriculture is the leading contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, ocean deadzones and many major problems the planet is facing today. I&#39;m very tired of this bias. The science is all there. Adopting a plant-based diet is one of the most environmentally-friendly choices a consumer can make.<br /><br />2. It focuses mostly on widespread consumer choices. In reality, corporations, governments and high-class citizens contribute exponentially more to climate change than you and I.

These people supporting the lie that has been repeated over and over again since the beginning of the last century when you look a old news reports. Their is a quick fix. Get rid of all the climate alarmist. Unfortunately only people with some education understand how the lie is created by the US and EU governments through billions spent on fraudulent research. There are no oil or coal interests spending money on it because they know that their fuels will be needed more and more following the failed renewable energy programs and the destruction of the nuclear power source that could increase energy while STOPPING CO2 production. If it would really be such a danger that would be the only sensible thing to do at a much lower cost than renewables.

But just look up the raw data records of temperature and sea levels. Without manipulation by NASA and NOAA they do not show any rise. Look at the arctic ice record. It was supposed to be ice free in 2013. It is the same extent and thickness in 2018 as it was in 1971. Look it up at UBC website. There is no statistic that shows a rise in extreme weather events in the US. Rather the opposite. And so on ... it is not about chemistry or computer models.

Individual competitions among single citizens may be a grassroots motivation, but the real damage comes from our industries, our products, our materials. There needs to be a greater push to ramp up fuel economy, and rid ourselves of dependency on oil. That means, no gasoline, no plastics, and less fresh water consumption. <br />I have made a commitment to myself to rid my household of unnecessary plastics. Once a bottle is emptied, I will actively search out eco-friendlier solutions, with better packaging, and less harmful chemicals. It&#39;s easy to turn down grocery bags, and plastic razors, disposable cutlery and dishes, and other items that use low grade plastics. I won&#39;t use takeout containers unless they&#39;re made from recycled fibers. I&#39;m investigating my city&#39;s recycling program, and seeing what forms of waste are predominantly making up our landfills. My plan is to get involved with the city council to start asking businesses to invest in biodegradable options for packaging and products to help eliminate waste. Our disposable items are some of the worst designed products imaginable, in terms of material waste to produce them, and the amount of waste involved in throwing them away.<br />I know people out there think that this is alarmist, and we are putting undue economic pressure on industries to compete for energy conservation and carbon capture, but the way I see it, it&#39;s essential to revolutionize our energy sources and infrastructure. It&#39;s like having someone argue for the candlestick industry in the age of the incandescent bulb. Why wouldn&#39;t we want to upgrade?!

Because the age determined by the carbon-14 method may be appreciably different from the true age in certain cases, it is customary to refer to such dates in “radiocarbon years.” These dates, obtained from a variety of deposits, form an important framework for Holocene stratigraphy and chronology. The limitations of accuracy of radiocarbon age determinations are expressed as ± a few tens or hundreds of years. In addition to this calculated error, there also is a question of error due to contamination of the material measured. For instance, an ancient peat may contain some younger roots and thus give a falsely “young” age unless it is carefully collected and treated to remove contaminants. Marine shells consist of calcium carbonate (CaCO3), and in certain coastal regions there is upwelling of deep oceanic water that can be 500 to more than 1,000 years old. An “age” from living shells in such an area can suggest that they are already hundreds of years old.",UCTjk-MZHD7rsUMBgx29GTSg,1,UgzVJqrfO1fk364ETtF4AaABAg,DkZ7BJQupVA,2017-04-19 13:00:01

First lets change the current definition used in this video of Climate change, to actual climate change, not world temperature change. Climate change refers to a climate, a specific area of the world, and it's condition. This definition of climate change is the one we will suppose is correct, which it is, and going by this, I agree climate change is real, the climate of different parts of the world is constantly changing. However, Earth's overall climate has always warmed and cooled, and the 20th century rise in global temperature is within the bounds of natural temperature fluctuations over the past 3,000 years. Although the planet has warmed 1-1.4°F over the 20th century, it is within the +/- 5°F range of the past 3,000 years. A 2003 study by researchers at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics found that ""many records reveal that the 20th century is probably not the warmest nor a uniquely extreme climatic period of the last millennium."" A 2005 study published in Nature found that ""high temperatures - similar to those observed in the twentieth century before 1990 - occurred around AD 1000 to 1100"" in the Northern Hemisphere. A 2013 study published in Boreas found that summer temperatures during the Roman Empire and Medieval periods were ""consistently higher"" than temperatures during the 20th century. According to a 2010 study in the Chinese Science Bulletin, the recent global warming period of the 20th century is the result of a natural 21-year temperature oscillation, and will give way to a ""new cool period in the 2030s. *""I'm referring to people that have died that wouldn't have otherwise... specifically I'm thinking of extreme heatwaves - that have killed thousands - that can be attributed to human-caused global warming.""* This point is irrelevant as it has to do with climate change, not world temperature change. Evidence suggests that this was a natural occurrence, and has happened since 1000 B.C. at least. *""Your Ice Age comment (presumably intending the Little Ice Age) is irrelevant... which you'd understand, if you understood this issue. But you don't, so the rational course of action for you is to silently and humbly heed the findings of the climate scientists.""* Going by your prior statement as to the comment referring to the ice age I had written, I can conclude that you have some knowledge as to why my statement was ""irrelevant"" Would you be kind enough to share this? Simple faculty and logic would conclude that, when coming out of an ice age, the temperature levels would rise as a direct result of the implied ice.",UC6Y0pOpwNY-HEVMlnULwVfg,1,UgzCt1tKxPvWCUVtztx4AaABAg,DkZ7BJQupVA,2017-04-19 13:00:01

To expect ""global average"" temperature to *NOT* rise or fall by 1 degree or sea levels by one cm or two over 100years is farcical!! That's assuming we can even measure such parameters accurately or meaningfully. Tide gauges for example, are subject to gravity and land movement etc. Earth's temperature varies between ~ -50C and +60C depending on *season, altitude, latitude, sunspot activity, atmospheric moisture, undersea volcanoes, ocean dipoles, tectonic plate movement, deforestation, urban island effects etc etc.* Moreover, the ""average"" temperature makes little attempt to consider data error or confidence limits, irregular placement of thermometers and accuracy of past empirical data.

I'm saying that what we do has only a small impact unless thousands and then millions of people start to do it. It's not a fact that consumers are the problem-- trying to stop consumers to stop the problem is like trying to stop erosion by draining the water from a river -- you have to get to the source.. In a previous comment I mentioned that Capitalism is a big issue (if not the main one).. Here's why I think that... First of all, money is power and people are greedy... The 3% that owns more money than the combined 45% of the world, tries only to maximise their own profit-- all at the expense others. Secondly-- targeting the consumers to stop the problem.. If you try to convince people to buy ethically sourced/environmentallly friendly products, it results in them switching to other sellers. Here's an example.. Let's say that Sony is super environmentally friendly.. Instead of buying an iPhone, you convince the masses to buy an Xperia, for the good of the environment.. Soon, the people in charge of Sony will find ways of maximising profit through cheaper materials and by cutting wages or by lengthening work hours.. What I'm saying is that positions of power attract the most greedy and immoral people.. I even heard that 1/5 CEOs are psychopaths (I'm not where this is from but I'm sure you'll find it if you look).. You also said that companies won't change because consumers won't change. Consumers can and do change. I'm sure you see how trends, as they arise, affect who the majority buys from and I'm also sure you've seen the sellers adapt their tactics to maximise their earnings-- these new tactics almost always involve things like cheaper labour or cheaper materials (with a questionable source).",UC2Mr0nuLRlg1x87KzkO4okw,1,UgxZyfrh_JJ8n9mzi-t4AaABAg,DkZ7BJQupVA,2017-04-19 13:00:01

We have whole contents that are partially poor and riches on a huge scale for one person. Millionaires will have found a way to replace work for us by using alternatives. I don&#39;t believe they&#39;ll hesitate to do anything else. As psychology says when a problem happens people often do something that gets rid of the feeling or of guilt. I know there are problems but ultimately. I believe if we cut back well live poorly and the 1 percentage of the world is going to have luxury and well be set back a few decades.

The Little Ice Age once again turned substantial ocean water into ice, lowering sea levels, and leaving former ports stranded. Not enough ice has melted since 1850 to make them harbors again. The ancient city of Ephesus was an important port city and commercial hub from the Bronze Age to the Minoan Warm period, and continuing through the Roman Empire.

Ruins of the old Roman port Ostia Antica, are extremely well preserved – with intact frescoes, maps and plans. Maps from the time show the port located at the mouth of the Tiber River, where it emptied into the Tyrrhenian Sea. The Battle of Ostia in 849, depicted in a painting attributed to Raphael, shows sea level high enough for warships to assemble at the mouth of the Tiber.

You seem to fall right in line with that as well, in feeling that business or privately funded science should be completely disregarded because of potential funding motives i.e. Scientists can be bought. But you also believe that politically funded science is unquestionably credible--- because politicians are pure of heart? and never have power of profit motive to influence outcome? Or Scientists working on the government payroll are special somehow and can't be bought? I like watching Judith Curry's discussions on climate change, she seems remarkably balanced to me. Science is weird like this. Everybody can believe a theory. Accept it as fact. But let one piece of data not fit, and the theory is so much trash on the road. Errors in data collection, erratic data collection, falsification of data, collusion to manipulate data sets, and ineffective modeling all remain what they are. All of these problems have very publically plagued the IPCC in the last 10 or 15 years. And yet the political drive is to upturn the world economy in a stampede of fear over what might happen. What I know is that the IPCC uses a number of models which diverge from eachother radically.

Of those 18% electrical energy needed they provide around 20% from renewable energies. A famous economist calculated that Germany can possibly cover around 50% of electric power needed from solar and wind energy. The problem is, solar and wind are both weak in winter, so giant storages are needed to provide clean energy in winter. The possible locations to build that storages are just Enough to theoretically cover 50% of the today's electric usage. To stop emission we would want to also turn traffic electric. Traffic is 33% of total energy needed. So with electric traffic 3 times more electric energy is needed than now. And as mentioned even now we need twice of the electric power than is possible.

Buying new energy efficient appliances literally does nothing for the environment. I hate to be the one to explain this but there's not a guy shoveling coal that's going to stop shoveling and take a break because you're using less electricity. Seriously though, the high voltage lines coming to a home has a regulated amount of power passing through those lines. If you completely disconnect the load of a house the exact same amount of power is passing through the power line. The transformer just produces more heat. The electrical grid has to work this way or there wouldn't be constant and consistent power which modern electronics require. Explaining it another way would be the power coming into a home is kept constant regardless of the power usage of the neighboring homes. The power does but fluctuate because of the usage of lack of usage of any other consumer of the power line. This is regulated by the transformer. All the buy new energy efficient... save the planet stuff is just a marketing ploy to get consumers to buy new stuff. Energy efficiency does save the homeowner miniscule amounts of money but that's all the good you can do from buying new more energy efficient appliances. Sorry there a campaign to spread disinformation to the mass markets, but it is capitalism after all. I told you the truth believe it or not. If you want to believe there's a guy at the power station turning back a dial because you turned all your lights off go ahead. Or you can find out yourself. Get a laser thermometer it better yet an infrared camera and look at the temperature of the transformer nearest to your home. Then flip the master switch to your home and watch what happens to the temperature of the transformer.

No one individual, company, organisation, or even nation can do enough to make an appreciable difference to climate change. That means that making changes means sacrificing profits, competitiveness or standard of living for no gain. The problem can only be solved by everyone doing the right thing, but as long as not everyone is doing it, those that are will be disadvantaged compared to those that aren&#39;t. Nobody on the macros scale wants to make the first move because addressing climate change only penalises early adopters, with no tangible reward or payoff. Nobody on the micro scale wants to do anything because the results are so insignificant - what&#39;s the point of buying that expensive high efficiency washing machine to save a couple tons a year when the factory down the road is pumping out that much every second? As with many things, climate action require huge participation at every level of society to be effective, and either the benefits will be experienced by everyone regardless of participation, or they will not occur at all. That means there is no reason for individual entities to participate beyond altruism, unless forced to or coerced by legislation or artificial economies like carbon trading/taxation.",UCMd5AutoY8pvgh-OP_0wwWw,0,Ugxz_r5qTDeLDAeei5V4AaABAg,DkZ7BJQupVA,2017-04-19 13:00:01

Anthro-Humans. 2. Uh, no, none of that is happening. I don't even get where it's coming from. https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/co2-levels-rise-climate-change-global-warming-fossil-fuels-met-office-a8744911.html CO2 emissions are only rising exponentially, emissions are 55% higher than they were in 1990. 5 times 1950 and 1 time 1980 when global warming science was confirmed. https://www.pbl.nl/sites/default/files/cms/publicaties/pbl-2018-trends-in-global-co2-and-total-greenhouse-gas-emissons-2018-report_3125.pdf https://www.co2.earth/co2-acceleration it doesn't help that, sadly, feedbacks are now kicking in (keep in mind due to a ""lag"" in effects, today's climate events do not reflect current CO2 levels) , such as the warming climate making forest fires and bark beetle attacks more common, turning forests into net carbon emitters as they burn and decompose . and the permafrost melts releasing CO2 and the more powerful Methane. Of which farms still emit much of. And other feedbacks: https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/story/taller-plants-warming-arctic-could-speed-climate-change CO2 targets are not being reached: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/12/07/climate/world-emissions-paris-goals-not-on-track.html and a rise in right-wing ""pro-economy"" ideals and nationalism may destroy any liberal progress on the matter. Right wing US president Donald Trump already fights to deregulate and undo climate progress. And even IF Carbon was constrained, 77% of all energy would still come from Fossil Fuels. i am one of little faith. Plant CO2 absorption rates will likely drop again, the heat forces plants to close their stomata for longer to prevent moisture loss. And one must remember that projections tend to end at 2100. The Great dying is being recreated ( https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/06/global-warming-extinction-report-the-great-dying ) it was caused by a massive disruption to the carbon cycle via extreme hyper-volcanism and the ignition of internal coal and methane deposits as a result. (https://skepticalscience.com/Lee-commentary-on-Burgess-et-al-PNAS-Permian-Dating.html) Likely forming the Siberian traps which to this day records for us the largest eruptions in geological history. Estimates suggest we are increasing CO2 levels 100 times faster than the Great Dying. By 2250 judging by current CO2 release rates (which we are surpassing) it is predicted Earth will be in Triassic period type conditions. Back then it was Too hot for Mammals. Mass desertification, iceless (higher sea levels, duh), with wetlands near the coasts. https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/jp33gx/climate-change-triassic-carbon-dioxide-emissions-global-warming Though it's hard to compare, the sun was much dimmer 250 million years ago, *our* future will likely be *worse*. I have little faith in CO2 absorbing tech, most such solutions either fall short when their net effect is taken (such as manufacture or powering) or have other consequence. And ultimately the damage that has ALREADY been done is irreversable on human timescales. ""Positive feedbacks were already occurring at less than 1°C of warming. Many carbon sinks are on the verge of becoming or have already become carbon sources. (https://psmag.com/environment/droughts-are-turning-the-amazon-into-a-carbon-source) (https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/national/gone-in-a-generation/forest-climate-change.html) As we race toward a nightmarish future with no realistic way to stop, we leave behind a “forever legacy” that will haunt mankind for the rest of eternity."" (metaphorically speaking, humanity will not last into eternity) (https://e360.yale.edu/features/taking-the-long-view-the-forever-legacy-of-climate-change) CO2 is also not the main problem. There are other greenhouse gases we are emitting. And anyways, CO2 is not the only existential threat humanity has, Overpopulation, Deforestation and animal equivalent Defaunation, biodiversity erasure due to human expansion, Plastic production, pollution. These and others are still very serious threats that rival climate change and make the sixth extinction more certain. People are already noting the incredibly loss in biodiversity that has occurred in the past decades.

Completely alien, dominated by a ""superpredator"" (official term) a single freak of nature species rapidly evolved from a freak environment, as an evolutionary dead end. (https://www.theguardian.com/science/2004/dec/29/evolution.science ) A world transformed, a world dying. Nothing like this has happened since the first photosynthetic appeared and destroyed earth with Oxygen in the early days of life. And Civilization is at fault, it consumes endlessly. And everyone wants it, Worldwide. It requires infinite resources from a finite planet. It is inherently unsustainable. It's it or us. And that is why I lack hope. Because Civilization is great! It saves lives, it entertains. It tastes great and glitters.

Every power plant is rated at a certain out put and produces that out put regardless of consumer consumption. Any excess power that is produced is then shunted into the earth at a remote location. Power grid sharing has reduced this problem somewhat but there are lakes all over North America (presumably the world but I only know of American and Canadian ones for a fact) that have hundreds of thousands of unused energy poured into them every year. If utilities came up with a storage method for all this excess it would do more to accomplish carbon neutrality than most people unplugging the and dishwashers to reduce phantom consumption.,UC9YMcJAqH_rUi2aWu-rWcJg,0,UgwcMzP__CR9tvvVLKl4AaABAg,DkZ7BJQupVA,2017-04-19 13:00:01

They are not precise with their statements. Yes, the climate is changing, but it is definitely not heading in a catastrophic direction at all. The earth has<br /> experienced countless periods of warming and cooling, and it is a shame that the leftist media are trying to persuade people about a problem that no well-educated person takes seriously. <br /><br /> To give <br />historical evidence, in the Roman times, the climate was even warmer than it is today (then it gradually cooled down), and it was at least as hot towards the end of the dark ages. Up until now, it is concluded <br />that global warming is not happening to the magnitude that Bill Nye and <br />Neil deGrasse Tyson says it is. We are still technically in an ice age <br />(known as the Pleistocene Ice age, that has been going on since 440,000BC) and the glaciers are still around eroding the landscape. Before this period, the ice caps were nonexistent. (According to Paleontologists) <br /><br /><br /> Furthermore, the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere (since the 1850s) <br />has been shown to not be correlated to the average temperature of <br />earth&#39;s climate. And it was only a few decades ago that people actually <br />started to take into account that the earth is warming up. The earth&#39;s <br />temperature only increases 1.5C every century, not identical to the <br />figures that professional organizations warned us about. Not only is the<br /> data confirming global warming not taken with serious intent, but it <br />has been confirmed that the climate change researchers tampered with the<br /> data, a fraud move that makes their rationale appear much less <br />attractive.<br /><br /> If you told me climate change is real, I would <br />ask, &quot;How much of that climate change is done by humans?&quot; or &quot;Under <br />which studies confirmed this to be true?&quot;.

Why wouldn't they show information from long before the industrial revolution to emphasize the fact that that is in fact what is causing this? But if you look back at records from long before 1850, they'll show that the earth has constantly undergone time periods of extreme heat and extreme cold.

What do you think the ""CC"" in ""IPCC"" stands for? The use of the term ""climate change"" has nothing to do with some evasion by scientists. Instead, ""climate change"" refers to a broader category of phenomena, that includes global warming. So global warming is a type of climate change, just like canines are a type of mammal. And just like biologists can use terms like ""canine"" and ""mammal"" without it being a conspiracy, climate scientists can use terms like ""climate change"" and ""global warming"" without it being a conspiracy. *This is all easily researchable.* ""Polluted Discourse: Communication and Myths in a Climate of Denial [...] Our results indicate that “climate change” has been used more often than global warming in the scientific literature and continues to be the more prevalent term in recent years. There also appears to be no relationship between the greater use of the term “global warming” (relative to climate change ) and higher temperatures.

If more countries switched more to green energy regardless of climate change it would make life for people better, it would be cheaper in the long run, and would make us not rely on finite resources to fuel our world. The point is eventually, no matter what, the world will have to switch to green energy because coal and oil will be depleted. This is inevitable. So why shouldn&#39;t we start the change now?

GWP #: CH4 oxidizes into CO2 after 12.4 years according to the AR5, hence the 20 year GWP (~85) is higher than CH4's 100 year GWP (28~36). We agree on this… 2.) GHG VOLUME (%): The atmospheric GHG proportionality of CO2 is 76% and for CH4 it is 16% (average highs). Hence, there is 4.75x more CO2 molecules in the atmosphere as CH4. We agreed here also… 3.) GHG VOLUME (PPM): I found that these percent ratios are perhaps misleading, so I tried parts-per notation. CO2 is 400ppm and CH4 is 1.8ppm… This suggests there is ~222x more CO2 in the atmosphere than CH4. Hence the ""4.75"" we BOTH calculated is perhaps useless. 3.) CALCULATION ***Via ppm volume: 85 / 222 = 0.38 (20 yr CH4 GWP / CO2 to CH4 GHG volume ratio); Total Atmospheric (aka ""TA"") CH4 is 0.38x less impactful than TA CO2 in a 20 year horizon. You mentioned at the end of your message the IPCC AR5 pg. 14 gave a figure indicating CH4's TA warming effect to be half that of CO2, which seems to confirm this result. *** Via % volume (incorrect?): 85 / 4.75 = 17.89 (20 yr CH4 GWP divided by CO2 to CH4 volume % ratio); TA CH4 is 17.89x more responsible than TA CO2 in a 20 year horizon. I don't know why you divided 36/85 (i.e. 20 yr CH4 GWP / 100 yr)… In combining GHG volume with the GWP on a 20 year horizon, we don't care about the 100 yr CH4 GWP figure.

You said you can get all your protein from plant based sources, I explained why that is far from ideal. You said you only need a certain amount of protein, I explained why that isn't true. Not sure what you're confused about. Pretty much every foodstuff contains protein. How much protein they contain in relation to other macronutrients is a whole other consideration. As for supplements, they exist for one purpose, to contain as much protein as possible for as few calories as possible and to be as palatable as possible, hence why bodybuilders use them. I.e. people who can't be bothered to get protein from other sources. They don't contain the micronutrients that can be found in whole foods, yet they often cost more. What's so great about that? As I said previously, one size doesn't fit all. What if someone is on a 2500 calorie diet but requires 180g of protein a day to support their level of physical activity? Are you suggesting they rely on supplements Mr Healthy? If we're talking about normal 9-5 normies who don't partake in strenuous physical activity, a vegan diet is more realistic. Not everyone is a 9-5 office working normie though. Again, veganism is far from ideal. Meat is great. A cheap source of protein and a nutritional power-house. Whey and Soy-isolate? Not so much lol.

Chickpeas are also a great source of protein, being 19% protein by weight (close to chickens 22%) and very high in fibre, iron, and vitamin B-6. Also meat prices vary depending where you live.

Correction: you only need 0.8g of protein per kilo to *maintain* your bodyweight on a lifestyle of low to moderate physical activity. If you live an active lifestyle, are an athlete (pro or amateur), crossfitter, bodybuilder, labourer, soldier, fireman, fitness enthusiast, whatever, your protein demands are going to be much higher along with your caloric needs, potentially 1.5g or higher per kilo. To suggest that one size fits all is ignorant. There are indeed plant based foods high in protein. But I'm sure none of them are as cheap and calorie-efficient as meat. If you can tell me a plant based food that contains 25g of protein per 100g for less than 280 calories (no overpriced supplements), I'll be impressed. If you can give me a plant-based source of protein that meets the above criteria and is as affordable as meat, I'll turn vegan right now. But even then, plant based foods won't contain as many omega 3s b12s, iron, zinc, creatine etc. Meat has drawbacks, so do chickpeas, kale, soy, brazil nuts, peanuts, grains and other vegan staples.

Climate change is real but i think that that changing the way people behave in regards to their co2 emissions is only 1% of the problem and getting companies to change their ethics is going to have monumental impact, here in Australia they tried to introduce a carbon tax to try and get alot of the primary industries to reduce their green house gas emissions taxing them on the amount of carbon they produce as an incentive to introduce greener and more efficient processing and to use the money gained from that tax towards funding for climate change research, but alas the mainly conservative privately owned media in Australia made a big ruckus about it and all sorts people were suddenly outraged by it demonizing the phrase &quot;carbon tax&quot; even people in without really knowing what it is or the significant environmental gains (That&#39;s another reason why were still have a conservative loser of a PM with the key word being thrown around during their 2 election campaigns over the past 6 years).I still think its important for indviduals overall to think more green, but that is in vain if corporations and governments are double crossing blaming citizens for climate change and then while individuals are pointing at each other &quot;they&quot; go behind everyone&#39;s back opening up coal mines and fracking(not climate change but still environmental) and keeping old ineffcient practices because newer cleaner ones are &quot;not as cost effective&quot;.

These animals use up land that may have once been a forest and they require more land to feed them. Now certain animals are worse than others, especially cows. Per 1kg of meat, a cow requires 20 times more area of land compared to a chicken (both for food and physical space combines) and they produce far more GHGs per kg than any other animal.

Developing countries can adopt green energy just as easily as we can, solar and wind are both cheaper sources of energy than coal, and they're getting cheaper all of the time. There's also no harm in those countries slowing their development in order to make sure that they're developing in a way that isn't going to drive all of humanity off of a cliff. I didn't dodge anything, I informed you about which option was cheaper. Not only would massively reducing dependence on oil eliminate the cost of military conflicts in the middle east, but it would also save the lives of thousands of American soldiers, save the lives of millions in the middle east, save the lives of tens of thousands of people who die as a result of air pollution in the US, and it would eliminate a major source of funding for terrorist groups. A global sea wall is FAR from being a realistic solution, and it wont do anything to stop the mass extinction event that has already begun... which is very likely to take the vast majority of the human race with it. When combined with storage, solar and wind can supply a huge portion of our electricity, and that electricity can be used to power just about everything, from our cars, to heat pumps for our homes, to industrial processes. Nuclear is also a great option if we nationalize our grid and improve on the model that the French have been using (with great success) for decades. Hydrocarbon fuels for certain kinds of transportation can be produced from captured CO2 with what is normally wasted energy from nuclear power stations.

In the US, it's 15% and growing. !00% of electric production can be done with renewables, as long as storage is included.

""...the same way as electric cars don't make the environment any cleaner because the electricity is predominantly produced by fossil fuels and this is in addition to the highly pollutive lithium batteries."" Except that's not true. Even when being powered by energy that is largely produced by fossil fuels, an EV is still cleaner than a piston engine vehicle, this is because electricity production is very efficient and because EVs are extremely efficient. In my area, which gets 80% of its energy from natural gas and coal, a Nissan Leaf is still cleaner than a Toyota Prius. The batteries also don't add much to the environmental cost of the vehicle, EVs make up for the cost of their batteries within a few years. "" MUCH cheaper than the $100 trillion paris agreement which will only reduce global temperatures by 3 tenths of a degree by the end of the century (delaying it by 8 years).""

Secondly, if we were to cover the entire planet with high quality, $5000 per meter, sea wall, and this includes the whole of Antarctica, the baron plains of russia, the Sahara desert ect. it would cost just $3 trillion. MUCH cheaper than the $100 trillion paris agreement which will only reduce global temperatures by 3 tenths of a degree by the end of the century (delaying it by 8 years). I approach this problem the same way i approach every problem, i take both sides, look at the positives, look at the negatives, weigh up each side and then reach a justified conclusion. and when you look at cost, standards of living and potential lives to be saved which are at the very heart of our government when making political decisions, my solutions beat yours in every category by miles.",UCba9q1P-Db6W5shxJzdMlOg,1,UggxopNesPLVhXgCoAEC,DkZ7BJQupVA,2017-04-19 13:00:01

It's to save as many lives as possible without severely damaging our standards of living. You may not have noticed but what governments are doing across the world now to prevent the worst effects of climate change is following that rule perfectly. It's called building defenses. here are some examples of climate issues and effective defenses: -droughts? We've built better pipelines, and more secure water storage systems, desalinization plants -floods? We've built better drainage systems, pumps to get rid of the water faster -sea level rise? Sea walls on the majority of our coasts -tornadoes? We've built stronger cities which significantly reduce the damage of tornadoes thanks to these cheap, non-obtrusive constructions we've managed as a planet to reduce the number of climate change related deaths by 98% in the past hundred years.

People dont want to just not eat meat but give up these common things. Here's an article from beef2live What comes to mind when you hear the word ""beef""? Perhaps, meat, hamburger, steak or even leather. These are all products of the beef animal (or cattle), but there are also many other byproducts. Beef byproducts are the products that we get from beef cattle that might not be quite so obvious. For example, soap is a beef byproduct because it uses beef fat. If you have a beef animal that weigh 1,000 pounds – 640 pounds of the animal will be used for meat products, such as steak, roasts and hamburgers. This means 64% of the animal is used for meat. However, 99% of the cow is utilized for meat and other products. From 1 cow hide you can get 12 basketballs OR 144 baseballs OR 20 footballs OR 18 volleyballs OR 18 soccer balls OR 12 baseball gloves. If you strung 1 year’s worth of hotdogs – end to end – around the world, you would go around the world 16 times! Leather is a very good example of a beef byproduct.  It is made from the cow hide and it is used to make byproducts. Byproducts are a product of the animal that is used as an ""ingredient"" in other products. There are many foods that are obviously byproducts, such as steak, roasts and hamburgers. Another more obvious product is milk and other dairy products, such as butterand yogurt. Name some food products that come from animals. Meat, beef, beef jerky, hotdogs, lamb chops. These are all direct example of food products, but they may be used in tv dinners and lunchmeats. Did you know that gelatin, what Jello is made from, comes from the connective tissues of the beef animal. So when you eat Jello, you are actually eating an animal byproduct. Other products that contain gelatin might include gum, fruit snacks like gummy bears, and marshmallows. Many medical products are made from animal byproducts. Some products may contain stearic acid that is found in fatty acids, such as in beef cattle. Ointments for burns and first aid creams may contain animal byproducts. Antirejection drugs are used when someone has a heart transplant, liver transplant or even a ligament in your knee to help the body accept the new organ. Animals, such as beef, sheep and swine have remarkable similarities to our own bodies. Insulin is utilized by diabetics. It can be synthetic, which means that is man-made, but it also can come from livestock. There is a sticky part on the bandages that can be made from animal fatty acids since fatty acids are used to make adhesives. Household and office products also may contain beef byproducts. Dog food might include chicken, beef or pork byproducts. Rawhide bones that dogs chew on are made from animal hides. Laundry pre-treatments contains enzymes – a protein found in cattle and sheep. There is a certain kind of china that knick knacks may be made out of that can be made from an animal byproduct – bone china. Bone china is made from the bones. There may be fatty acids from cattle or other animals added to toilet paper to make it soft. What’s on the label of the glue bottle? There is a cow on the label of glue because you can use a cow’s hooves and horns to make glue. Dish soap may contain beef fat that helps make your hands soft. Even film contains the beef product – gelatin - on the coating of the film. Candles may have beef byproducts in them to give them more strength, to help them last longer, and make them more opulent. What would crayons have in them? Probably beef fat, but there is also a kind out now that is made from soybeans. Paintbrushes can be made out of horse hair, but can be made out of the hairs from other animals as well. Sports equipment is often made from animal byproducts. Many professional teams use cowhide footballs. So not all footballs are made of pigskin like many people think. Footballs can be made out of both pig skin and beef skin. Volleyballs can be made from leather, and so can the baseball glove and the outer covering of the baseball. Industrial use – many lubricants and fluids may contain beef fats. Some inks used in printing contain animal fats. High gloss printing might contain animal fats. Industrial cleaners may also include beef byproducts. Grooming – Nail polish remover contain gelatin that helps give your nails strength. Soap, lotions, makeup and lipstick may contain stearic acid, a fatty acid. But not all of them do – as some people are allergic to animal byproducts. Some also contain lanolin which is a sheep byproduct. Shaving cream also contains stearic acid, a fatty acid. Many deodorants contains fatty acids. When people clean their contacts, they use little white tablets called enzymatic cleaners. Enzymes are a protein found in animals. Saddle soap is used on leather shoes and any type of leather product. It helps leather items maintain softness. Travel and transportation. Antifreeze may contain glycerol, an animal byproduct. Hydraulic brake fluid and car wax also may contain animal byproducts.   Highways are made of asphalt and contain a binding agent made from beef byproducts.

To put it into perspective, the oceans release more Co2 in a single day from a 2 degree change in temperature than we do in an entire year. In the IPCC reports (which are legislated on by politicians, bureaucrats and corporate heads from multiple nations) Co2 is noted as being the key factor which increases water vapor, which is the main catalyst for change in temperature.

Clouds that develop from water vapor, can also act as fast positive feedback or as negative feedback, depending on how high those clouds are in the atmosphere. These effects are important, since CO2-induced global warming has augmented atmospheric water vapor levels, as expected, since warmer air can hold more moisture. So atmospheric humidity increased during the recent period of pronounced global warming (from about the late 1970s to the present), with a humidity decrease during the global cooling / temperature stagnation period of ~1940s to the 1970s.",UCWZGVxHPDNenYs5mkxjUwhA,1,UgiHoR3K-o7_HHgCoAEC,DkZ7BJQupVA,2017-04-19 13:00:01

It sounds like you've met a lot of mean vegans 😢 I say this cuz Ive met a lot of vegans that are not only for animals rights but also care about the environment (dont own cars, only eat local food and even promote vasectomy!) and are aware that its the way we mass produce meat that's harming the environment. This is also why Ive been so intrigued by the vegan community and want to become one. I am sure that there are extreme vegans out there who twist facts to get people to not eat meat and I do think this is wrong for sure! But I also think because veganism is most often associated with conserving the environment their movement does more good than harm. For example the vegan community is banning palm oil although its a plant based food becuase it causes deforestation. I would have never known this if it wasnt for them! So I think you and I are on the same page when it comes to greenhouse gases...What do you think about the usage of water and deforestation and agricultural waste that comes out from the agricultural industy.

My problem is with people thinking that localy raised free range organic cattle meat is more environmentaly harmfull than strawberrys air flown from south america.

To make a difference in the climate, we&#39;d have to plunge ourselves back into the 1850s.. Before the industrial revolution. No transport, no communication. At this point we&#39;ve gone too far, and that&#39;s the only thing that would help anything. Using hair spray that will rise the temperature by 0.0^200000% in the next year, isn&#39;t going to do much. We need to find a source of energy that is as powerful as carbon based energy sources. Now, don&#39;t say solar, because the government in the US has invested billions and billions of dollars in getting these, yet only 4% of the US&#39;s energy is from solar power, even after billions of dollars later. Humans deal with things, it&#39;s what we do. People think that sea level is going to wipe out humanity. It&#39;s not. Move in land 5 miles and you&#39;re fine. Would you rather sell your coastal house for a low price, or go back to the 1850s? That&#39;s what i thought. Furthermore, it&#39;s not like the climate hasn&#39;t changed before. Throughout history climate has risen, and fallen. Global warming, and global cooling. Why do you think the ice age happened?

We humans have lost a lot of our natural instincts, we&#39;ve grown to become too emotionally attached and deeply fear the experience of the emotions of loss.<br /><br />Lesser species have no choice, they can&#39;t build sophisticated technology so they have to adapt to their environment in order to survive; survival of the fittest. <br /><br />Us humans however are emotionally compelled to hold on to the things we&#39;ve got because we do have a choice, we can build sophisticated technologies. So instead of adapting as a species to fit the environment, we now try to adapt the environment to fit us as a species. And that&#39;s where the logic has gone wrong.<br /><br />Climate change on earth is nothing new, it has wiped out hundreds of trillions of life forms, both land and water, and that&#39;s totally normal, it&#39;s not an evil sin.<br /><br />We are only here now because somewhere down the line a sub species of ours perished while we continued to live on, so we owe it to our selves to thank climate change for wiping out our brothers and sisters, and allowing us to live successfully in this climate, we owe it gratitude.<br /><br />So at what point do we say to our selves that climate change is a bad thing? Climate change is a psychological issue, not a scientific one. Humans have just becomes too sentimental and afraid to let go of things that have ran their course.<br /><br />You know, the ice caps might melt and we might lose polar bears, but the rise in sea levels might make rivers in Africa run with gold and solve drout completely providing water and rich farm lands, saving millions of human lives.

Awareness of that fact is simultaneously encouraging and discouraging, because on one hand, by reducing our consumption of meat, especially beef, we can each do our part in redcing our ""carbon footprint."" Eating less animal meat (or hardly any at all or even none at all) is not only good for the environment, it's good for our bodies. But then, I LOVE the occasional steak, you know? I LOVE chicken and pork and lamb and fish , and frankly, I'm not keen on giving those things up entirely. What's discouraging (besides having to reduce or eliminate all animal meat) is the fact that it's going to be extremely difficult to get a majority of humans to change their eating habits. It's easy enough to buy a car that's fuel-efficient or a fridge that has a great Energy Star rating, but quite another to get people around the world to reduce meat consumption by 90% or 75% or even 50%. And let's not kid ourselves, the meat industry is not going to go quietly into the night. They're going to kick and scream and create adds that will create doubt about meat and its effect on the atmosphere, just as the oil companies do with regards to climate change itself. It's going to be a tough road to hoe. But I'm glad you brought it up.

Right now it might actually be a bit boring since you're learning the fundamentals, but stick with it. Chemistry really comes alive once you get to Organic chemistry and beyond to Quantum, Physical, Inorganic, and Analytical. Be sure to get a good grasp on molecular orbital theory and periodic trends, and don't worry about memorizing the table or atomic numbers of all of the elements. When you get to college I'd recommend taking a major in either Chemical Engineering/Bioengineering, or one of the subsets of chemistry/biochemistry. You can also go for a general chemistry major, but be aware that you won't go into some of the topics with as much specificity. For now, check out this page, know how to assign charges to molecules using formal charge, get to know how to write electron configurations, and get a good grasp on stoichiometry. The rate laws and molecular kinetics will come in college or AP chemistry if you decide to take it (highly recommended - you'll be able to move right to organic once you graduate), and they involve some calculus. First go here: http://www.chemguide.co.uk/atoms/properties/atomorbs.html Then here: http://www.ch.ic.ac.uk/vchemlib/course/mo_theory/ I don't mean to overload you with information, but I sense that you have an interest in the subject, so I thought I might as well send you some useful links!

Methane is a greenhouse gas like carbon dioxide (CO2). But the negative effect on the climate of methane is 23 times higher than the effect of (CO2). according to The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United States (FAO) agriculture is responsible for 18% of the total release of greenhouse gases world-wide.(this is more than the whole transportation sector). Cattle-breeding is taking a major factor for these greenhouse gas emissions according to FAO. Says Henning Steinfeld, Chief of FAO&#39;s Livestock Information and Policy Branch and senior author of the report: &quot;Livestock are one of the most significant contributors to today&#39;s most serious environmental problems. Urgent action is required to remedy the situation.&quot; Livestock now use 30 percent of the earth&#39;s entire land surface, mostly permanent pasture but also including 33 percent of the global arable land used to producing feed for livestock, the report notes. As forests are cleared to create new pastures, it is a major driver of deforestation, especially in Latin America where, for example, some 70 percent of former forests in the Amazon have been turned over to grazing.",UCDjYUH31EwXIJk6hgA-wkuw,0,UghPrbcVTRxscHgCoAEC,DkZ7BJQupVA,2017-04-19 13:00:01

Then i became more of a doomer/imminent extinction/the sky is falling type but again ran into facts that contradicted that, so i had to change my mind again. In the end i got the dull conclusion that i stated earlyer. No utopia or perfect world and no exciting hollywood type end of the world/armageddon/ big finale/ i told you so moment.

But basically i think that we are the major driving force for climate change right now. This seems to be the position of most scientists and ocean and atmosphere studying organizations. As for the should we do anything or what should we do about it question, this is a political issue. I was a big fan of alternative energies but later on i discovered that they all have their flaws. No energy source is perfect. Fossil fuels are an amazing resource and people don't give due credit for their importance in the world we have today. It's just that we overused them. Wind and solar would be the best option to try and mitigate the reducing of use of fossil fuels but i fear it would not be enough to totally replace them. This would mean a change of habits and lifestyle especially in the transportation sector, but this dosn't seem politically, culturally and socially acceptable. So what do we get? Denial on one side, and on the other a belief that some magical solution is just around the corner ""free energy, thorium, etc.."" while everything stays basically the same. We will keep talking a lot about it, but real change won't come because it would be unconfortable even to the average ""global warming believer"". The serious predictions about climate change don't mean the end of the world or human extinction even if we burn all fossil fuel reserves, but they will mean that we won't be able to feed billions like in the world we have today. War, famine, disease , political unrest will drive civilization to it's knees before the climate stabilizes by around the 2300s. we will have a very different world. As for the fauna and flora they will suffer immensely because this is very different to the glacial/interglacial pattern of the neogene/quaternary epochs (the last 20 million years), add the other pressures made by humans with land use and chemical polution/deforestation and we get a very smaller range of animals and plants to live with. New species will eventually come, but this takes millions of years to happen so we will live in a biologically enpoverished world. But hey, i maybe wrong. I've been wrong about stuff before.

Solar activity alone should give us no reason to compound that global warming with our greenhouse gasses, given that what we've experienced in the decades around 1960 is the highest solar activity in over 8,000 years. It may go down, but I see no reason to expect the Sun to cease its rise in activity at our convenience, especially since we're breaking temperature records in a 100-year solar minimum.

Banning CFCs—something Ronald Reagan did—didn't ""crush"" the cosmetic industry, it just pushed for change. Our planet is warming alarmingly. Atmospheric GHG concentrations have also almost doubled since the industrial revolution. The only problem with taxing carbon dioxide emission is that America recently switched to the petrol standard. The percent change of anthropogenic atmospheric carbon seems minuscule, but substantial seems minuscule to the untrained eye. It may not seem it, but an average increase of 2ºC is incredibly large on an annual basis, and strongly affects marine ecosystems. The weather event, El Niño, has incredibly substantiative effects on all of Earth's climate, despite being caused by what is simply a lack of upwelling off of the coast of Peru and Ecuador.

Moreover the other negative effects of farming are present as well, i.e. overfertilisation and use of pesticides.

Since you obviously missed civics class, or had a leftist teacher who bad mouthed the Electorial college, let me explain: We are the UNITED STATES. States. Yet's repeat it again. States. There is no national popular vote for the preseident because the president needs the broad support of the nation as a whole. Have you ever heard the term ""Checks and Balences""? Our two houses of congress are represented by 2 for each state in the senate and by a population in the house of representives. This is to give little states some power vs the big states. Otherwise CA and NY would control the nation. The Electorial college electors are given to the states via the same calulations. Each STATE has a popular vote that then apportions their electors as they see fit by that states laws. Some have winner take all, some devide them by the popular vote for each canidate. Then the Electors vote in congress. You just don't get it. Personal attacks while ignoring real arguements just proves my point over and over.

How about a balance between the two why does it have to be solely one side. For example we see successful enterprises like Tesla rethinking how we drive cars which will reduce carbon emissions. We see companies growing lab meat. These industries wouldn't be possible solely on government. That being said the role of government is important in the policy making side like common sense regulations that reduce impact on hampering innovation but at the same time reducing our carbon footprint or reducing methane are very important. Again this isn't so easy this isn't something that can take government alone that argument doesn't help either as it feeds into the conservative narrative that GW is a hoax to perpetrate government control.

The transportation from farming areas into the nearest cities is no problem, however just like you said, people should make conscious decisions on what food they buy (for example: fresh strawberries in April (in Germany) come from Spain or Italy and don't just create pollution on their way to the shop but also cause serious damage to the soil where they are produced.)",UCdANWirTN7EkDTTkdaGAjpg,1,UghpLZzv-fKRGngCoAEC,DkZ7BJQupVA,2017-04-19 13:00:01

One problem is how much of our food is produced faraway from the cities that require them. The transportation of food is one factor. Another is how we depend more on livestock as our primary consumption. Whats more excessive eating and obesity has increase the production of meat. Im not saying meat is the problem though. If people would think to eat healthily and be more conscious about how we eat we can still contribute to reducing carbon emissions.,UCOQ7qQruT8FjwipGWWDbl5w,1,UghpLZzv-fKRGngCoAEC,DkZ7BJQupVA,2017-04-19 13:00:01

I don't eat beef anymore, because I was eventually found to have an intolerance to a protein in it which had been making me sick. Now, I used to ~love~ a good, medium rare steak, and it was really hard to give it up. But a year on and I don't miss it as much. Since cutting beef out of my diet, I've noticed the stark contrast between the price of beef and the price of the other staple meats. It's stupidly cheap, at least in my region. Compared to say, lamb, a similar quality cut of beef or veal is usually 1/4 to 1/3 of the price per kg, which implies, to me, a surplus of supply. Of course I know there's more of a cow to go around than a sheep or a chicken, but that's also more animal to feed and fart and poop. Considering the impact that we _know_ cows in particular have on both the natural environment and greenhouse emissions, and the sheer amount of resources required to feed and maintain our supply, I feel like we could really stand to make change in this area and see results, not just in methane reduction, but also the availability of arable land that could have its use redirected to providing food to people rather than livestock, since at the moment only a tiny portion of the crops we produce are for people. It doesn't mean we have to cut out all livestock overnight, or even all cows & beef, but by scaling down beef operations by a small amount in each location, we could start the ball rolling towards positive change.

This is about how much destruction mass producing livestock causes. The cows we breed alone produce more than two billion pounds of manure nitrogen per year. Studies can tell you that animal agriculture is the leading factor of polluted waters. You can feed 800 million people with the grain that we feed to livestock. Meat production is responsible for roughly 20% of greenhouse gas emissions. The water we give to these mass produced livestock use half the water consumed in the country (USA). 260 million acres of land is used to produce feed for livestock. This is where veganism comes into play. Yes I agree in the Stone Age and whatnot eating meat was necessary to survive but that's because it was a necessity. Today it is not a necessity. Back then they didn't have supermarkets/grocery stores. Today we do and it carries all the food you can imagine. The amount of harm we are doing to the environment is not worth a burger, bacon, or those ""all-you-can-eat"" wings. Especially when there's so many other options right in front of you.

It has to be shown with the higher numbers representing less usage because people naturally want to see numbers tick up. It&#39;s why idle games like cookie clicker work at all as a game. I recently got a new car that shows me my average mpg. When I first started driving I watched it a lot and even then I was around 31 mpg on average. Since then my car has essentially trained me to be more mindful of that and now it comes naturally and I&#39;m sitting at an average of almost 40 mpg and it was such a natural progression that I hardly realized that the way I was accelerating and decelerating had changed entirely. Putting in a system like that would play to psychology and almost make a personal game out of getting the highest numbers.,UCy7lNfnRpilnZpA5dLmvAZA,0,Ugjjf45BXgt9iHgCoAEC,DkZ7BJQupVA,2017-04-19 13:00:01

The argument is CATASTROPHIC ANTHROPOGENIC global warming (CAGW) has not been demonstrated sufficiently""* That's just a straw man you contrarians use to misrepresent mainstream climate science, akin to how many creationists use the phrase ""molecules-to-man"" to misrepresent evolutionary biology: Another claim advanced by those who reject the mainstream scientific agreement on climate is that the consensus position consists of a claim of catastrophic anthropogenic global warming or the frequently used acronym CAGW [...]. However, CAGW is rarely, if ever, defined or sourced to a mainstream scientific organization or study. Any scientific study’s result, or statement by a researcher, that does not fit a contrarian’s personal, flexible definition of CAGW can therefore be adopted as ostensibly supporting their view and refuting the mainstream, even when such results are actually consistent with the mainstream position on climate [...]. [...] Additionally, we find that *catastrophic anthropogenic global warming* [CAGW] is essentially a term that is never used in the relevant scientific literature by mainstream sources. Furthermore, in the press it appears to be used exclusively by climate contrarians. The term is typically neither defined nor attributed to a mainstream scientific source. Our conclusion is therefore that CAGW is simply a *straw man* used by climate contrarians to criticize the mainstream position (50)."" https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-20161-0_3 *""The questions are do humans cause the bulk of this warming and is it catastrophic? The 97% consensus group were not asked that question.""* Again, because that's a vague straw man you contrarians made up. There's an evidence-based scientific consensus that: A1) There has been global warming since the mid-20th century. A2) Humans [largely via anthropogenic greenhouse gases] caused most of this recent warming. A3) Most of the recent [or near future] climate change is [or will be] caused by humans. A4) Climate change is a serious problem and/or a danger to humanity. The following sources document the consensus on A1 and A2: Table 1: ""Consensus on consensus: a synthesis of consensus estimates on human-caused global warming"" ""Does it matter if the consensus on anthropogenic global warming is 97% or 99.99%?"" Page 49 of: ""Models, manifestation and attribution of climate change"" For the consensus on A3 and A4: Among AAAS (American Academy for the Advancement of Science) scientists with relevant expertise (PhD earth scientists current working), there's a *95%* consensus that climate change was a serious problem and a *93%* consensus that recent warming is mostly caused by humans: ""Earth Scientists Views on Climate Change"" http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/07/23/elaborating-on-the-views-of-aaas-scientists-issue-by-issue/ And in another survey, *~87%* of climate researchers thought that humans caused (or will cause) most of the recent (or near future) climate change, while *~86%* of climate researchers thought that climate change poses a very serious problem and/or a threat to humanity: Figures 88 (v043) and 2 (v007) of: ""The Bray and von Storch 5th International Survey of Climate Scientists 2015/2016"" https://www.hzg.de/imperia/md/content/hzg/zentrale_einrichtungen/bibliothek/berichte/hzg_reports_2016/hzg_report_2016_2.pdf *""currently the empirical data needs a fudge factor of multiplying what we know by 3 times in order to get the models to create the claimed future change.""* If you're talking about positive feedback, then yes, that does applying CO2-induced warming. But not, it's not just a ""fudge factor"". It includes evidence-based conclusions regarding surface albedo, clouds, water vapor, etc. I discuss that further here: http://blamethenoctambulantjoycean.blogspot.com/2017/09/myth-no-hot-spot-implies-less-global_15.html Climate models actually tend to under-estimate that positive feedback, and thus under-estimate how much global warming will be amplified in the future. For instance: ""Climate Sensitivity in the Geologic Past [...] Proxies for CO2 and temperature generally imply high climate sensitivities: ≥3 K per CO2 doubling during ice-free times (fast-feedback sensitivity) and ≥6 K during times with land ice (Earth-system sensitivity). Climate models commonly underpredict the magnitude of climate change and have fast-feedback sensitivities close to 3 K"" *""The problem with the science, and the message, is that if you plug in the numbers we have into the models, there is little to no change. They found that the numbers needed to be 3 times bigger to create the effect that was desired, and then set about attempting to explain that this 3 fold increase in the empirical data was valid due to ""forcings"".""* No. The direct forcing from CO2 yields roughly 1.1K of warming per doubling of CO2. That is amplified by three-fold to ~3K due to *feedbacks,* not forcings. These feedbacks include positive feedback from water vapor, clouds, and reduced surface albedo. These are included in the climate models. For example, see figure 5 of this paper: ""Positive feedback in climate: stabilization or runaway, illustrated by a simple experiment"" https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/BAMS-D-14-00022.1",UCWZGVxHPDNenYs5mkxjUwhA,1,UggscSCBSVBoN3gCoAEC,DkZ7BJQupVA,2017-04-19 13:00:01

Vegans want you to stop eating all meat including the ones that don't contribute to climate change. Sustainably fished wild salmon is not contributing to climate change. Even poultry has a pretty small affect relative to other meat. This was my point about vegans. Instead of being honest about which meats are worse than others, they lump them all together to try and convince people to stop eating any meat. The problem is that you could actually convince a lot more people to avoid certain meats than you can convince people to go vegan. You're hurting the cause in a sense because you turn people off of the issue by telling them it's all meat.

It forgets that you are turning something that does not affect the climate (oil, which is a bad example because it's a carcinogen, but it does stays in the ground and rarely poisons anyone anymore since the easiest oil to find is no longer near the surface) into something that does affect the climate (carbon dioxide).",UCXgXK2-Nj03Piw1SLjgEdQA,1,UgjkIL5s8jynIXgCoAEC,DkZ7BJQupVA,2017-04-19 13:00:01

And I'm not sure what I said that you disagree with or think I was wrong about. Yes, raising animals produces CO2 but it's less than energy production- something we can actually fix and people are generally on board with. I don't even want to get into the water consumption because we'll just go off on a tangent, but, yes I am aware of that fact. And, yes, there are more people, cows, pigs, chickens, etc. My point was there were millions of large herd animals prior to global civilization and their presence alone did not significantly tip the scales of the climate; certainly not with the speed we're changing it now in any event. That was in response to someone above claiming that ""animals do not create pollution."" Bullshit they don't. The difference is how they live that determines the effect of their pollution. Humans and their waste are subject to the same laws and effects. Be wary if hedging your bets on the statement, ""If everyone just did X the world would be saved."" If everyone just became vegan, if everyone just rode their bike, if everyone turned their lights off all the time, etc. These plans simply do not and cannot work. Any plan that hinges on people being *better* people is doomed to failure. People can be counted on to be selfish, ignorant, argumentative, and resistant to change.

Animal agriculture is incredibly destructive to the environment because *they don't move around*. They stay in one place and food is brought to them while waste keeps being funneled into the same fields of waste. Enormous numbers of animals are bred and raised in the smallest possible space. This is not how animals evolved to live. 40,000 years ago when there were large herds of giant animals pooping all over the place the earth could handle it because herds MOVE. The land was all grass, trees, rock and dirt. There was an ecosystem that could support life and kept a balance.

In fact, the causes of those past periods of rising and falling temperatures serve to underscore how sensitive the environment is to change. Check out this link.

Perhaps the province you visited might already have fully implemented one, but that's a different story and these taxes are usually designed to be revenue-neutral, in which the money goes toward making low/zero-emission cars cheaper and improving public transport in areas where it's lacking. Also...climate change isn't just everything getting progressively and permanently warmer, which is why it's not 'global warming', and freak weather incidents aren't an indicator of much of anything on a long-term scale. That's why US Senator Jim Inhofe's idea to bring a snowball into Congress as 'proof' that climate change was a hoax made him an utter laughing stock. Today it randomly decided to start snowing here in Vienna after weeks of sun and rain, but that doesn't mean that the oceans aren't dramatically acidifying, sea levels rising and winter ice caps rapidly shrinking. What pollution does have an immediate effect on is the air we breathe and water we drink. Is it not a good idea to reduce our emissions simply for those two, essential things, if not for the longevity of the planet/human race? And electric cars are indeed happenning, espcially in places like Norway (which has very far distances between population centres, I should add), where the (concervative) government is providing heavy incentives for EVs. And considering that the cars are now nearing 300 miles of range (which is wholly adequate--a human can't really go more than that without needing to stop anyway), it's not going to take 30 years to get to 500+ range.

According to the second law of thermodynamics such a planetary machine can never exist. Nevertheless, in almost all texts of global climatology and in a widespread secondary literature it is taken for granted that such mechanism is real and stands on a firm scientific foundation. In this paper the popular conjecture is analyzed and the underlying physical principles are clarified. By showing that (a) there are no common physical laws between the warming phenomenon in glass houses and the fictitious atmospheric greenhouse effects, (b) there are no calculations to determine an average surface temperature of a planet, (c) the frequently mentioned difference of 33 degrees Celsius is a meaningless number calculated wrongly, (d) the formulas of cavity radiation are used inappropriately, (e) the assumption of a radiative balance is unphysical, (f) thermal conductivity and friction must not be set to zero, the atmospheric greenhouse conjecture is falsified.""",UCn4tgj2phtAG-K6D7cgvLBw,1,UgiSDwAz1Wv7vHgCoAEC,DkZ7BJQupVA,2017-04-19 13:00:01

The problem is that molecules like CO2 make the sun heat up the earth twice instead instead of the sun's ray hitting the earth and bouncing back into space. IDEALLY: The Sun is suppose to shine its rays on earth- some energy gets absorbed, but most gets reflected back into space. PROBLEM: CO2 and other molecules act as a glass ceiling forcing the rays of light that where on their way out of the earth to bounce back onto the earth a second time. This will create unnecessary heat. We don't want this heat. It will cause a whole litany of problems and changes. I think it is a mistake not to recognize the molecules creating the green house effect and just oversimplify the sun as the main charge of climate change.

There is only 8 countries that have land above 60 degrees north and they're mostly habitable because of the warm currents that flow near their coasts. Rising sea levels caused by melting glaciers and ice might very likely stop the currents. The warm Gulf stream from the Caribbean flowing all the way to the coast of Iceland and Norway warms up all the Nordic countries and without that the climate there would be so cold that life there would become nearly impossible. Also the warm Alaskan current might stop due to rising sea levels. That is why you see the Nordic countries and Canada battling against climate change.
