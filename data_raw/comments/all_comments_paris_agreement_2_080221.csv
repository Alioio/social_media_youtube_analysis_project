Have this clown turn over his taxes. 
No more Trump next year people please. 

Have him show his taxes and get out of offic...bye Felicia!!! The future can't afford it. 
Climate change? Donald obviously knows nothing about it and we can't afford to have him roll back policies that would help us with our deteriorating climate. 
 Every young American MUST go out and vote!!!!! Go register NOW! Trump ROLLED BACK ALL THE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS BECAUSE HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT OUR FUTURE & THE FUTURE OF THE YOUTH. LET HIM KNOW HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT HIM NOT CARING ABOUT OUR EARTH/ENVIRONMENT OR THE YOUNG PEOPLE'S FUTURE. WE HAVE THE POWER TO CHANGE OUR FUTURE BY VOTING FOR SOMEONE WHO CARES ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING!
 Trump's for the rich. LISTEN WELL PEOPLE. He doesn't doesnt care for the poor and middle class of this country. Help Trump find a new address and vote for whoever wins the primary other than Trump. They are changing  the laws for the rich to take advantage of the poor in the workplace and to change the tax laws to  to raise taxes for the poor and middle  class besides the RICH. EXAMPLE: As in the gig economy, As in Uber. We aren't able to sue the rich companies like Uber. Uber's new disclosures policies PROHIBIT drivers from suing Uber for Missclassifying drivers, failure to pay overtime for YEARS and not giving thier drivers tips by advertising ""tips are included"". The rich and wealthy are being allowed to break the Labor Laws that have been in place for years! Whoever heard of this? They are trying to get rid of the construction and old labor LAWS!!
Liar's!! Stop opiate consumption because it only profits the FDA, BIG PHARMA and  hospitals...again the rich are taking advantage of the poor and middle class. Its the leading cause of death today and you young people are falling for it and allowing them to fry your brains with drugs. That's how they control the General population today. It is profiting the wealthy and causing a drastic homeless Holocaust just to profit the rich. Look at the state of this country!!! They just caught a ship with drugs on it, Trump was saying Mexicans are bring drugs from Mexico, can an attorney check into weather or not JP Morgan who was found to be affiliated with this ship full of drugs. It was 1 ton of cocaine! Please! have an attorneys get a hold of this information to see if they're going to prosecute whoever was involved in bringing these drugs into this country on this ship so we can prove that we are locking up the poor who bring some drugs to this country yet they don't prosecute the wealthy who bring tons of drugs into this country.
 The WEALTHY are not paying their fair share of taxes and our war torn streets scream loud and clear that rich aren't paying enough taxes.  Donald is rich and he is for the RICH ..do you think he is for the poor or middle class? 
Get out and vote: Democrates, otherwise WE WILL GET STUCK WITH TRUMP AGAIN IF WE ALL DONT VOTE FOR THE winning PRIMARY candidate.  (WE CANT AFFORD TO VOTE FOR AND independent because it will take votes away from the Democratic party and Trump's SCUNK again. WE WILL GET STUCK WITH THIS JOKER AGAIN. 
 Stop fracking and geoengineering clouds now. Stop these refineries, Trump is for the Rich coal miners that ruin our Earth.The United States is burning up and you say there is no evidence of what Greta is talking about. Changing a light bulb!? Really! get out if your own way of your own ignorance and research just on the weekend you'd be floored as to what's really going on with these fake smog in the air. Fake clouds, fake mist in these sprinkle that they are sprinkling us with today.Those fake rains are toxic for us. Wear hoodies and use umbrellas no matter how light the rain might be, these acid rain clouds are toxic for us and I believe are the cause of cancer and other illnesses today. 
Look up the YouTube video of a scientist who has been recording the North Pole ice caps melting for 35 years from a glacier down to an ice cube and down to nothing. The United States of America and the world is flooding. YouTube it. People from around the U.S. and the world are recording it and posting it. 
Look up the lawsuits around the world that common folks are starting to sue th companies that PROFIT from creating these clouds. YouTube: "" We are suing these B@stards"" it is not misspelled. You'll see that common folk are suing, thank God people are fighting back. YouTube video from ""Anonymous"" on these fake clouds. They say they are controlling the weather, really! Well we can PROVE we we're fine before geoengineered clouds, stop your lies. Look at these fires alone, they are creating mass destruction due to their GREED.  
I know a lot because I am a cancer survivor. I beat cancer naturally (including 3 blood transfusion). I studied cancer for 5 years and eventually beat it. Thank God. 
I know what I know by default because I wanted to live and not do Chemotherapy and managed to survive. 
I know that they have the cure for most cancers in 45 days but the FDA won't approve it because they SAY THEY WANT MORE TRIALS, MEANWHILE people are dying like flies from cancer. Do you know what a 45 day cure would have done for me? I wouldn't have lost almost 12 years of my life trying to cure myself and recoup from being sick for 7 years with cancer. I wouldn't have lost my house and my successful trucking business. Look up the ""Vice"" show "" the new cancer cure"" something a long that title. They show a man who has stage 4 brain Cancer- and get rid of it within 45 days. Brain Cancer- is one of the hardest Cancers because the Brain is on a different lymphatic system than the rest of our body. John McCain died of brain Cancer- served our country and not even he was privy to the stem cell cure, not even on a trail basis. Wouldn't you be mad if you or a loved one had cancer and was dying and you KNEW there was an easier way or a less TOXIC way to curing cancer than going the chemotherapy route which is a horrendous route to take. Yet the FDA APPROVES TOXIC CHEMICALS IN OUR FOOD AND YET ALL WE TALK ABOUT ON THE NEWS IS FAKE NEWS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP...SHAME ON ALL YOU AMERICANS WHO ARE SLEEPING. WATCHING A STRAIGHT UP PUPPET SHOW AND WE ARE ALL TOO OLD FOR IT, YET THAT'S WHAT YOU ALL ARE DOING. MEANWHILE WE ARE LIGHTING UP LIKE A MATCH!! and all everyone want to do is be on social or watch fake news. 
There's a lot of ways to make a difference rather than posting here on things you know nothing about. I'm an older woman and I fight for my children, my grandchildren and the young people who are dying with cancer in unprecedented numbers. I fight the Medical system that pumping opiates to the AMERICAN public for injuries,  depression, someone going through a divorce or something (when years ago the doctors prescribed counselors and Psychotherapy of some kind and not opiates) for attention span deficit disorder they prescribe Ritalin  (look up the side affects of that on a child). My daughter when she was 10 years old was  recommended that by the psychologist and her teacher in her elementary school and I refused. I was 28 years old at the time and I laughed and said ""absolutely not""!!! I told them "" you aren't getting my daughter on drugs cuz you have too many kids. They said my daughter isn't focused and she gets off her seat and visits her classmates. I told them my daughter is a social butterfly and I will talk to her about  that but you aren't drugging up my daughter and turning her into a zombie cuz you can't handle your class. Today my daughter owns a successful Beauty salon in Los Angeles and If I would have listen to them my daughter would be strung out on drugs or Dead by an overdose. She is 40 years old now. 
I'm not asleep, never have been since I was a child. God has blessed me with knowledge and foresight on issues that affect us today. It is a gift and a blessing. 
Wake up, before you are knee deep in the murky Waters or your house is on fire literally. Come on the Amazon Forrest is on fire and we can't afford for that to happen. 
The rich get richer and the poor get poorer, we have got to try and stop the crooks from killing us and doing us in just for PROFIT. They are a bunch of old Crocks and on their way out. Watch the movie ""All the money in the world"" you'll understand the mindset of the rich sick old Crocks that would slice their own mother's throat for profit. Most of us all will live long enough to witness our own demise because you'd rather be entertained by nonsense and fake news. Which is costing us millions of our tax dollars. 
PLEASE vote for the winner in primary besides Trump otherwise we will get stuck with him again. He is for ONLY THE RICH TO PROFIT MORE. WAKE UP AMERICA your house is on fire. 
Test the soot on our cars and get the Lawsuit AGAINST the AMERICAN Vietnam war vets against the Federal Government and compare what the sprayed on them to the soot on our cars, in our blood stream and sue them to stop this maddness crookery.

Actually, temperatures won't go down, it will increase by 0.06 (circa) degrees by  2100 instead of increasing by 5 fucking degrees. (because those scientists corrected Mr. Trump when he misquoted and misinterpreted their research)

Fact the paris agreement creates jobs in a whole new industry which is one of the fastest growing in the world.

Fact- China knows it, and is overjoyed that it wont have the US as a rival in that Industry.

Fact- India pledged that 40% of its electricity will come from non-fossil fuel sources by 2022, eight years ahead of schedule.

Fact-India wants to sell only electric cars by 2030.

Fact- India and China where cut some slacks because they are developing countries, with a lot of people who are extremely poor that can't survive such strict environmental rules, but are now on the forefront of clean energy innovation ahead of even the Paris Agreement requirements.

Fact-there is no penalty (under the paris agreement) for not respecting your CO2 emission SELF IMPOSED objective.

Fact China added 35 gigawatts of new solar generation in 2016 alone. That’s almost equal to Germany’s total capacity, just in one year

That's not how it works. Average global temperature isn't like a bottle that you can fill and empty based on decisions that you make. If the world reaches a 1.9C increase compared to the pre-industrial age, there is no chance of avoiding 2C.

What the IPCC says is that the increase is around 0.85C today and on course to hit 2C around mid century or whatever long it takes us to produce 1000 billion tonnes of CO2.

Besides, 2C isn't a magic number, nothing particular happens at 2C, the situation at 1.9C is basically the same. And the effects on the climate are just guesswork. We could live in an unlivable world at 1.5C or we could very well have something manageable at 2C.",2.0,1.0,,3tnDjCA4peY,

I didn't say I think they care about the planet.  For all I know, they're just a bunch of greedy fat cats who had some ulterior motive.  That's not the point I was making.  I was simply saying that having this climate deal is a whole lot better than not having it. 

But let's get back to my original comment, which you clearly disagree with.  If you disagree with my comment ""We might survive this century afterall"", then you naturally agree with the opposite of the my comment, which is ""We are still unlikely to survive this century"".  I find that harder to believe than my comment. 

My political views have almost nothing to do with my comment, but if you'd like to talk about them I'd be happy to.  But let me preface it by saying as long as you have one really good reason for supporting whoever you support, I won't give you crap about it.  I ask that you give me the same respect. 

My number one reason I support Bernie Sanders is that he's rejecting super PACs.  Super PACs make up more than 60% of campaign funds, and they are inherently corrupt.  Even if I disagreed with everything else about Bernie (which I don't), I would still support him because he's the only candidate we can trust.  Everyone else will hold their tongues, make vague promises, and use overused applause lines, but only Bernie can make specific promises and deliver.  The whole reason politicians have a hard time getting anything done is because they have wealthy donors they answer to and want to appease.  Without them, a politician could finally do what he said he'd do.  That's why Bernie has confidently set goals like free college and infrastructure spending.  Because he's the only one who COULD do it.  Everyone else would have some dead weight holding them back. ",0.0,1.0,,3tnDjCA4peY,

I believe that climate change is a big deal, the sources that I trust don't particularly think it has any cheap tricks up its sleeve, so therefore, I'm optimistic.  I feel like that's a reasonable opinion.  No need to call me retarded. ",0.0,1.0,,3tnDjCA4peY,

It’s not rusted pipes, it’s that the city didn’t maintain the water quality and then tried to hide it. 
The connection to my argument was that we all need clean, safe drinking water. 
If there is anything we should all be learning from this past four years it is that if we don’t pay attention and hold our elected officials accountable at every level of government, that we suffer. 
We only have this one Earth. 
What one nation does affects all the rest.
Clean air, clean water, renewable sources of energy and wisely written regulations that hold polluters accountable, not just scramble statistics to make it look better on some chart, should be our primary goals to save the planet for or grandchildren’s grandchildren.
I’ve lived half my childhood in El Paso, seen the Aurora Borealis in the sky over Anchorage and survived the Winters in Minnesota.
Nature is an awesome thing, but if we push the limits too far, we won’t be able to fix it. 
We take so many conveniences for granted and we have forgotten skills our grandparents and great grandparents used every day. Sometimes simple things are best.

It was an awareness issue 20-30 years ago, and a proof issue for a bit after that.  What we lack isn't awareness, it's will.  Talking about the problem is not the solution, it's hardly ever the solution.  We need to act.  We all know this and most of us agree.  But how do we act? What do we do?  We need direction.  This problem is too big to solve at the individual level, but individuals are part of the solution, they have to be.  Voting isn't viable; too long in between and too few choices.

What can people do right now and how will it solve the problem?  We hear a lot about sacrifice. give up plastic, give up meat, give up cars, give up whatever.  These are not viable solutions.  Only the most devout will ever follow them and the efficacy is questionable.  Someone needs to stand up and say ""Here is how we solve this!""  It's not going to be me.  There are already plenty of people standing up saying ""We need to do something!"" that time has passed.  It's time for an actionable plan.  Not just for the governments or the rich, but for everyone.  ""Here is your part. Here is how it helps.  Here's how you can do it.  Here's how it makes your life better and easier."" and most importantly ""Here's some help.""

Plastics are a problem? Fine. Where's the group offering viable alternatives? How do we get them? Where is the group pushing Walmart, Target, Amazon, etc. to use them? Where's the sign-up sheet for the ballot initiative?

That is a huge step!!
And yes there are other ways to help day to day, As easy and simple as this might sound these small steps can help reduce your imprint on the planet:

Understandably you need a car to get around but if you can reduce driving, even one day a week,
Make sure to turn off all your lights when leaving a room, Reduce your need for electricity as you can during the day. 
Take shorter showers, don't let the water run from the faucet continuously,
When shopping use a tote bag, they're easy to find only a few dollars cost, which of course reduces the need for plastic,
Buy a water bottle and use it daily, do not buy single-use water bottles.
Reduce your need for straws it might sound silly but if you're offered a straw don't take it, 
If you like to drink coffee make it at home, instead of buying it daily from a store.
As you mentioned your vegan, be cognizant of the clothes and the products that you purchase going forward; obviously don't buy anything leather; car interior clothes; coats also not made from down goose, shearling,
 Angora n mohair sweaters are taken brutally from the skin of Mohair & Angora bunnies, They literally tear off from their skin.
With products all products u purchase; be wary of where they derive from,
I suspect these are enough steps for now, 😘

Thank you again for your compassionate choices going forward and helping to reduce your carbon footprint on the planet.",2.0,1.0,,A_jUNzE28zc,

Manmade climate emissions have made bush fires dramatically worse. Our recent Royal Commission into our devastating fires have laid the blame solely at the feet of climate change.

There are patents for many things. Try looking into how patents work. There were patents for flying cars 50 years ago.

Why would scientists lie to you? They live and breathe on the same planet we do. Do you think it's a mass conspiracy? Do you realize how many people would have to be involved if it was? Can you comprehend how hard it is to keep a secret with that many people in the know?

My opinion is that climate change is a real threat, not only to humanity, but also for the planet. We still have time (although not much) to reverse the global temperatures hitting 2°C and keeping it below or at 1.5°C. If we hit the 2°C mark in the future, without caring about how much we, as humans, emit, then I can assure you that catastrophic events would increase such as hurricanes, typhoons, hotter summers and colder winters, which would not only affect human lives but would also be disastrous for the natural ecosystem as well. We need to put carbon taxes on energy and oil companies and educate more people, especially youth and children, on how climate change and global warming is and will affect us if we don't keep track of what we're doing. This is the reason many companies have SBTi (Science Based Target Initiatives) in place so that they can meet the 1.5°C or transition into a lower carbon economy within the next 20-25 years. We get it that we want more profits and revenues by keeping the world hooked on fossil fuels but at the cost of what? Your future? Your child's future? At the cost of our only planet we call Home?

Of that over a billion people,  close to 800 million of them aren't still connected to the power grid witch involves a massive uptake in CO2 emissions.  And blaming and shaming the western countries into financing poorer countries into energy is ironical.  We have scarified our middle class with globalization, most of the manufacturing and industrial jobs with good benefits are now in factories in developing countries.  

I do want to save the planet but the Paris accord is equivalent to a Kyoto 2.0 and what good did that do?  And green energy is a really nice and fantastic lie at the moment!!!  Researchers at ADEME, a french institution who was asked to study the true environnemental costs of an electric car.  They found that during their utility period, electric cars had the same carbon footprint as a gas powered car.  And that sucks!!!!  But it's the truth!  

Wind and solar are unreliable and need a lot more  R&D to be effective as replacement solutions for the electrical plants in use now.  Germany has to buy electricity from France and has reopened coal plants to support demand when the sun and the wind are insufficient.  

It is a very counterintuitive solution.  In reality and it has been largely studied in Europe, nuclear energy is the safest, cheapest and most efficient way of producing electricity by far.  And that was very surprising to me!!!

Don't fall for easy solutions, there are none.  Don't let fear guide your decisions, it's unhealthy as individuals and globaly",0.0,0.0,,1DdfNU5iATU,

They want to lower CO2 levels, the world is noticeably greener, since CO2 levels have risen. The number of extreme weather events have gone down dramatically, including hurricanes, tornadoes, drought, floods, heat waves, forest fires. The oceans are not rising faster, and have in fact stopped rising as fast, which has been approximately 6 inches per 100 years. They repeat the same tired lies and predictions of doom, only to have 0% of their predictions come true. They even resort to altering the temperature data, to make it better fit their faulty logic. It is just another part of their scare the world into submission to an non-elected World Government. The EU has a similar system, look what a mess it is, and quickly falling apart. The Globalist Lunatics will say and do anything to push their lies, to scare people into doing what they are told, without questioning why. They have now scared everyone into hiding from a virus.

Flatearther also do not believe NASA, they say that  NASA faked moon landing and that picture from space or in space station is faked or how they call it CGI (computer-generated imagery).
Yes see level is rising everywhere, average is per 3.3mm per year for whole planet, somewhere is 2mm somewhere 4mm but since that is from NASA you do not acknowledge that.
2) Coral reef dying main cause is acidification of oceans since CO2 dissolve in ocean water.
We produce 37 billion tons CO2 per year what is enough for 5ppm CO2 in air increase per year since whole atmosphere CO2 weight is 3020 billion tons but we measure 2.5-3ppm CO2 increase in air every year because rest of that 5ppm is absorbed in ocean water (about 30%) and land. 
CO2 dissolve in water just like your CO2 in soda bottle and water become more acidic that's main reason why corral reefs are dying 
3) Millions of species will go extinct you are partially right for this one but climate change is big contributor for that.
4) This is very dangerous to say. If people have migrated before that do not justify man made climate change to do the same. We here where I live had 2014 millennia flood, 99% houses was half in water. 
Today population here where I live is 40%, all rest emigrated to Germany! 
Also people in developed countries like USA, EU, China(not there yet but 25% of total CO2 emissions is from China right now), Canada, AU etc contributed the most to this crisis and people who suffer the most are in Africa that have TODAY  more than 50 times lower CO2 per person than you an me.
This is called climate injustice.
5) Again NASA (what can I do, I trust NASA) have scanned areas of all ice on Earth and yes some areas are gaining ice (what is most of the time used to cherry pick data that ice is not receding for deniers) but in TOTAL  ice on Earth  is lower every year in global.
6) More extreme heat waves=less water. I live next to the river here and just told you that we had water level that was highest in history of measurement and also lowest level was in 2016, lot of low level aquifers dried up that year and it's more and more a problem as times goes.
7)""The hurricane data does not show an upward trend in frequency, or intensity"" In frequency no but in intensity yes, Why? Because hurricane draw their energy from ocean warm water, global warming=warmer water=more energy=stronger hurricane and what is important to say they have tendency to move slower and to last longer what is not good when they hit some area.
8) Australia had unprecedented fire and hundreds of millions animals died in that fire also people and properties.
As I say warmer planet= more energy= more devastation=more drought extremes
9) You know that this year and last year antarctic measured record temp. also in polar cycle 
""Russia's meteorological service has confirmed the temperature record of 38°C (100.4°F) in the Siberian town of Verkhoyansk on 20 June. Maximum temperature from June 18-28 exceeded 30°C. Copernicus said the fires had surpassed the record number of blazes seen in the region in the same month of last year.Jul 7, 2020""
Righ now Russian tundra is on fire.
Just to point out last winter here we didn't have snow almost at all and we have snow every year.
Last 10 years Christmas was more than 50% times without snow, that something thy older people do not remember to happen.

If you do not trust NASA you can check my national meteorological data from 1862 to today and see that last 10 years was hottest in measurement history, here (I adjusted to English) https://meteo.hr/klima_e.php?section=klima_pracenje&param=ocjena&MjesecSezona=godina&Godina=2012 it is adjusted to 2012 year but you can see all years from 2012 to 2020 too, you have scroll bar. 
You see that average year temp in whole country (Croatia) was warmer from 1.3°C to almost 2°C (1°C is about 1.8F so rise in Fahrenheit is 2.3F to 3.6F).
This  is much more than what is global temp rise of less than 2F. That is case almost on all land mass of earth, land is warming faster and ocean water slower. What mean that today CO2 that is present, even if we stop CO2 emissions tomorrow, have potential to increase global temp. to 1.5°C (2.7F).
At the bottom of that page you have graph of last 160 years for Croatia.

Plastic pollution is used to distract people from climate change and pretend that tackling that will solve climate change, what is total BS.
Also only 8% of oil is gone on plastic (what is less than 2% of total FF) production BUT most importantly plastic do not increase CO2 in air if you do not burn it and we all know that plastic can be recycled and is.

Solar and wind is the only future, with hydro power, geothermal etc, nuclear can't last forever! 
This is FACT, but if in the mean time we get fusion reactor, that will be awesome.
Let forget on a moment that we do not have climate crisis and we continue business as usual and burn out all FF.. what then? with 10 billions people with no heating in winter, no transportation, no electricity? 
Total collapse would happen much earlier. 

As I say I'm not some greeny that is against nuclear, I'm 100% for nuclear but not all countries have nuclear, in Australia for example is banned! 
Nuclear is stable and reliable energy source but fact is that is very expensive to build (what again should not be problem in this crisis) and you need in average 7 years from plan to finished product.
Solar power plants with same power as nuclear are build in 6 month, wind also, in general less than 1 year.
Also solar and wind TODAY are cheapest sources of electricity production, but have only drawback, intermittency.
You forgot fact that energy demand is 40% lower in night than during day where solar is in full power.
Also charging electric cars can be adjusted for peak hours during day. 
Also you forgot potential that all that fleet of electric cars in the future can be sort of storage so they are accumulating power during day when excess solar power can be stored and during night that stored power from cars can be grid tied to power electricity network during night. We all do not drive our cars 90% of the time.

""CO2 may cause less plant nutrition, but it does cause more trees to grow and more trees means more oxygen to breath."" You are not realistic here
O2 in air is 20.95% and CO2 is 0.0415% and even if all plants such ALL CO2 from air to 0% CO2  and transform it to oxygen, concentration of O2 will just rise to 21.05% what is insignificant and humans breath normally as low as 19.5%. 
Also a study of humans exposed in 2.5 hour sessions demonstrated significant negative effects on cognitive abilities at concentrations as low as 0.1% (1000 ppm) CO2 likely due to CO2 induced increases in cerebral blood flow. Another study observed a decline in basic activity level and information usage at 1000 ppm, when compared to 500 ppm. 
I do not have to point you that you fill dizzy and can have headache in spent air full of CO2, you know by your self.
So more CO2 in air is harmful for human breathing.
Human race is created in 250ppm air and today is almost 420ppm.

What is very important to recognize that problem with global temp. is SPEED that is rising!
It is 9 times faster than ice age recovery time what would  need 5000 years for 6°C to rise (10F) what is about 0.11°C per 100 years and right now is 1°C per 100 years. 
This is what is concerning, also CO2 is rising much faster more than 40 times faster. 
Today CO2 rise is about 1%  per YEAR!

I have a filling that you watched one of those fake and misleading videos on YouTube like from pragerU what stands for guy surname prager and U for university. Just to tell you pragerU is NOT university. 
They sometimes get funds from fossil fuel business and guest retired climatologist or pretended green peace founder like Patric Moore or Richard Linzen who all approve IPCC reports but say that it's not big deal. 
It's all burning but it's OK!

""Also building solar panels and wind turbines is extremely unsustainable. Don't get me started on that. ""
Ooo i will, it's my expertise, so bring it on. Forget all above, just elaborate this.

U know that I watched so many videos about climate change, good one and misleading ones and this is one that is most interesting.

Just because some of the ice is melting does not mean its causing sea level rise. Look into landmass rising and falling. That is also a factor in sea level issues. No doubt that some places are eroding fast, like maui beaches, but that does not mean its caused by warming. 
2. The coral reefs are a more complex problem than just ocean warming. They absorb many pollutants that make their way into coral reef zones due to run off and boat activity. Can't blame it all on ocean warming. 
3. Millions of species are going extinct, I see that. But is warming causing it? or is building over their habitat, introducing invasive species and polluting the air and water with our heavy metals, pesticides, etc more of the problem?
4. People have been displaced and moving around the world for thousands of years due to all kinds of reasons... its not a new reality. Thats part of the life on earth I guess. 
5. Despite melting glaciers, there are growing ones. Look a little harder. There is still somewhat of a balance happening.
6. Millions of people are already  losing access to fresh water due to bottle water companies, poor management of public facilities (Flint, Michigan), less aquifer refill due to invasive species, not just because of climate change. The earth changes its climate over thousands of years, and we freak out because we think it should be one way because its been that way for hundreds of years or whatever recent history we have documented. We don't understand we must adapt to natural changes...
7. The hurricane data does not show an upward trend in frequency, or intensity. It may have caused more damage than history because we've built more for it to damage. The data is up and down but no exponential curve on it. It just seems that way because news is fucking with you. Also weather events are highly influenced by sun cycles and we went through an 11 year intense cycle that caused massive hurricanes in the US. Now we are in a low activity cycle of the sun... 
8. floods and drought? Australia has been in drought for 500 years, they just discovered. Chile had a drought that lasted 400 years. Before climate change bullshit. Floods and droughts are natural cycles of earth climate
9. ""They will become"" so you predict the future now? It hasn't been true over the past centuries... https://geochange.er.usgs.gov/sw/impacts/biology/fires_drought/

I don't trust NASA's data on anything related to climate change. Neither do previous NASA employees/scientists that are now retired. Look up what they have to say about it. 
Average global surface temperature rising is not the same as atmospheric global temperature. Of course surface temperature is rising because of engines, heaters, burning, heat island effect, anything that causes heat contributes to higher heat at the surface. 
Here is another perspective by a scientist https://jennifermarohasy.com/2008/07/measuring-global-temperatures/
Most people are looking at the data in hundreds of years, but when we look at data in 1000's of years.. there have been times when CO2 was just as high and things survived.
If you look at headlines over the past 100 years they are all sensationalized drama.
The world is constantly changing and that involves the good, the bad, the ugly, the beautiful. This whole blame humans thing for the earths climate is sketchy at best. 
We should be blamed for plastic pollution, consumption problems, addiction to convenience, pesticide pollution, water pollution, letting corporations run countries... these are things we need to focus our energies on. Not climate change. 
Solar and wind are the most inefficient forms of energy production that are claimed to ""help us off fossil fuels"" it simply cannot due that unless we used nuclear to create a baseload power that solar and wind will always need to operate. Also building solar panels and wind turbines is extremely unsustainable. Don't get me started on that. 
Tidal energy has been attempted to be harnessed many times... the ocean corrodes fast... so tidal energy has not successfully been harnessed for long term. 
CO2 may cause less plant nutrition, but it does cause more trees to grow and more trees means more oxygen to breath.

Because of these negative effect : 
1) Sea level will cause trillions of dollars of damage.
2) The world's coral reefs will die.
3) Millions of species will go extinct.
4) Millions of people will be displaced.
5) Lower altitude glaciers will disappear.
6) Millions of people will lose access to fresh water.
7) Hurricanes will grow more intense.
8) Floods and drought will increase.
9) Forest fires will become more frequent and grow into the size of megafires.

Yes the world is always evolving but in something better not in uncertain future on planet that is conducting  global  experiment on climate.

I'm pretty much sure that we are causing this climate change and that is happening extremely fast and that current CO2 rise per year is 50 times faster than what was recorded in natural data records.
NASA have satellites in orbit above atmosphere and measure Sun radiation last 70 years and their observation that Sun is pretty stable source. Only thing that have had rapidly changed in last 200 years is CO2 in atmosphere, from 280ppm to today 415ppm.
This is their opinion on Sun influence  https://climate.nasa.gov/blog/2953/there-is-no-impending-mini-ice-age/
 ""The earth hasn’t been warming for quite a few years now anyways"" 
This is not true, there is constant average global year temp. rise as we speak you can see it https://realclimatescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/graph-1.png

""I do doubt that specifically CO2 is the problem, because plants thrive off that.""
Yes, plant grow faster in higher concentration CO2 but they are less nutritious, 10% less proteins and less some minerals like iron and zinc.
Also no one talk how more CO2 in air is harmful for us humans, we do not breath CO2 like plants or other negative effects of extremely fast CO2 increase like ocean acidification (30% of our CO2 emissions are dissolved (absorbed) in oceans water ).
But mostly because climate change negative effect mentioned above. 
Also from our (developed countries USA, EU, AU, CAN etc) negative effects of global warming people that contributed at least suffer the most like African people (climate unjustice).
They still have carbon footprint that is smaller than 20 times than you and me.

Yes nuclear is good stable source very low CO2 intensive that will help a lot but wind and solar also you have geothermal and tidal etc.  You can have lot of thing done with heat storage from Sun.

Did you know that in last 10 years UK from 40% coal electricity generation and less than 1% wind and almost nothing solar  they have today less than 5% coal, almost 20% wind and more than 3% solar.

You might not have caught my very first long comment on this video that explains I’m a 4.0 student of a sustainable science management program, set to graduate next May. I agree on your understanding. Here’s a question for you? Why is it such a bad thing the earth is warming? The earth has been warmer than this in history and people lived and animals thrived. The world is always evolving in and out of species and global temperatures.
Also you can’t be sure that fossil fuels and human activity are the majority cause of the earth warming. Maybe we don’t have as much control over that because it’s influenced more by cosmic activity. The earth hasn’t been warming for quite a few years now anyways. I don’t doubt our cement jungles have contributed to warming the planets surface temp. I don’t doubt that Fossil fuel pollution is a problem. I do doubt that specifically CO2 is the problem, because plants thrive off that. I think the other ghg’s are the real problem to air and water pollution. I do doubt wind and solar are the mainstream solution to decarbonizing the planet.

I know all that theories from both sides but I have one for you to just to think.

You know that in artificial greenhouse like plastic or glass plant greenhouse is warmer than outside or you know when you go inside your car on sun it's much warmer than outside.
Something tells you that inside is stronger green house effect.
Same is with more CO2 in air . CO2 lets light to pass from Sun to Earth but when light hits the ground it transform it self in heat and warm surface of the Earth.

Now warm earth radiate heat back to space (but now it's not light but invisible heat radiation that you can only feel when you stand close to warm object, like furnace) that radiation is suppressed and absorbed by greenhouse gases like water vapor, CO2, CH4 (methane) NO2 etc. You have bunch of gases and major is water vapor you see it here what percentage what gas contribute to warming https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas#Impacts_on_the_overall_greenhouse_effect

So energy from Sun can pass but heat radiation is suppressed by GHG and more you have them in atmosphere stronger greenhouse effect will be and less heat is lost to space.
You can see here if you are interested http://www.ces.fau.edu/nasa/module-2/how-greenhouse-effect-works.php Without water and CO2 (two main  GHGases ) average year temp. on Earth would be 0F or -18°C like on moon.

Lets back to that plant greenhouse .
Once when person understand why is warmer inside and what specific difference is what is causing to be warmer in comparison to Earth atmosphere than that person can say that it know basics of greenhouse effect.
Also if some individual learn something new in misleading way (for example on YouTube) it's much harder for that person to accept real genuine explanation because our brain is wired that way to resist that to happen. First information have priority.

Thing is that  everybody today is some kind expert in climate change what is unrealistic.
Also no one  is questioning are we made of atoms and all around us is made of atoms, we just trust science and scientists.
What is problem with climate change and why is politicized is because all our energy infrastructure was build on fossil fuels. Our heating in winter, our electricity generation, our transportation.
And to change this to renewable, big infrastructural change must happen but not all people from fossil fuel business want that.

Fact is that no mater what climate change or not we will transform our society in renewable sources not because we want to but because we have no choice. FF are finite source of energy and we can't function without energy. And with this much people on Earth those reserves will become only just more expensive and more costly and harder to dig up and environmentally unfriendly (fracking, water pollution etc) 

Also people do not get that fossil fuel price is going up every year. You can see on this graph of oil price history last 150 years that oil price was pretty stable from 1900-1970 year, about $16 per barrel and today is 3 time higher (inflation is included , red line in that graph) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_oil#/media/File:Crude_oil_prices_since_1861.png",0.0,1.0,,1DdfNU5iATU,

I know that here in Croatia, EU in 2001 oil price on gas station was 1 ""units "" and today is 2.6 ""units"" so almost 3 times higher price in just 20 years.

Look this graph and see what is going on with finite sources like oil as reserves deplete and population was going up last 50 years https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_oil#/media/File:Crude_oil_prices_since_1861.png

You see that oil price from 1900 to 1970 was stable about $16 per barrel  and today is almost 3 times higher with spikes from 1970 to today 7 times higher than 1900-1970 average.
You see where is this all going as reserves deplete and it's more and more costly and harder to dig up new reserves and more devastating and less environmentally friendly (fracking etc, water pollution..)
Carbon tax is just speed up of transition to more stable energy prices and solution to climate change disaster at the end.
Problem is that those companies who have big investition  in fossil fuels are not willing to invest in sustainable future but want you to pay more for their same product that is more and more costly every year to have things that you can't live without like heating in winter, electricity, and transportation. 

Not all fossil people do not want to change but some that won't are crating stories that carbon tax is bad thing  and you know why.
Or that will bring to us socialism or Marxism and other nonsense.
Renewable is actually key to capitalism and sustainable future not fossil fuels.
With fossil fuels you will only have economic degradation since energy price from FF can only go up.",0.0,1.0,,1DdfNU5iATU,

The truth is, however, that at out current population of 7.5 billion, are resource demands are so high that we are, in fact, altering the natural world. It's not that we 'think we can' alter nature, it's that we are. Statistics are showing that, whilst global temperatures have been high in the past (i.e. millions of years ago) which many believe is substantial evidence against climate change, the current rate of increase in such a small period of time (merely 2-3 centuries, not 2-3 million years) is concrete evidence of human-induced climate change, considering the almost parallel occurence of the industrial revolution and the exponential rise and fossil fuel use. So, go ahead. Deny it all you want. The fact is that climate change IS occurring. 97% of experts (not casual tradies or restaurant dishwashers who think they know it all based off a Forbes article) agree that is human induced. Experts who have done the research, know the processes and analyse the correlation.",6.0,1.0,,1DdfNU5iATU,

The U.S., Syria(because they currently have a freaking war going on in their country which is obviously a pretty immediate problem that takes priority), and Nicaragua(didn't sign because they felt it was too lax on larger countries since there was no penalty).

When it comes to economics - clearly the rest of the world sees renewables as important, and companies will choose to have products made in other countries because they don't want their brand to be seen in a negative light.

This has already happened numerous times globally for different reasons, for example: US companies have avoided using Chinese manufacturing due to not supporting Chinas lax labor laws, involving child labor and poor/unsafe working conditions for employees.

A common misunderstanding of the climate system characterizes it like a pendulum. The planet will warm up to ""cancel out"" a previous period of cooling, spurred by some internal equilibrium. This view of the climate is incorrect. Internal variability will move energy between the ocean and the atmosphere, causing short-term warming and cooling of the surface in events such as El Nino and La Nina, and longer-term changes when similar cycles operate on decadal scales. However, internal forces do not cause climate change. Appreciable changes in climate are the result of changes in the energy balance of the Earth, which requires ""external"" forcings, such as changes in solar output, albedo, and atmospheric greenhouse gases. These forcings can be cyclical, as they are in the ice ages, but they can come in different shapes entirely.

For this reason, ""it's just a natural cycle"" is a bit of a cop-out argument. The Earth doesn't warm up because it feels like it. It warms up because something forces it to. Scientists keep track of natural forcings, but the observed warming of the planet over the second half of the 20th century can only be explained by adding in anthropogenic radiative forcings, namely increases in greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. 

Of course, it's always possible that some natural cycle exists, unknown to scientists and their instruments, that is currently causing the planet to warm. There's always a chance that we could be totally wrong. This omnipresent fact of science is called irreducible uncertainty, because it can never be entirely eliminated. However, it's very unlikely that such a cycle exists.",0.0,1.0,,jF5JRXSUBsc,

Humans today are emitting prodigious quantities of CO2, at a rate faster than even the most destructive climate changes in earth's past.

Abrupt vs slow change.

For example, downsizing the EPA rather than to have the top priority to abolish it entirely would probably be a much better approach. People are very correct to be concerned about this, however, statements made about the Interstate Commerce Clauses from State to State having a part in this issue are plausible. Something that People don't mention about the Environment and even Greenhouse gases is Property Rights. No one mentions the fact that our American Government (i.e. the Pentagon) along with China and Others bear responsibility for these particular issues. The key to a sound and sensible Environmental Policy is respect for Private Property Rights. The strict enforcement of Property Rights corrects Environmental malfeasance while increasing the cost of polluting. If your property has been damaged, you have every right to sue the Polluter responsible, the American Government can and should absolutely protect and enforce that right. After paying damages, the Polluter's Production and Sale costs rise, making it unprofitable to continue doing business the same way.

They are at war with God and his creation and they agree to keep using HAARP and chemtrails and other directed energy weapons and the like to alter the weather and destroy the world and then say that the people are at fault for the climate change issue so they can remove the rights of the people and eliminate people. The Mystery  Babylon new world order misleaders are all satanic liars who believe that the rest of the people are a disease in the world and need to be killed (another example is the virus issue they use against humanity) so that the world can become a better place for the elite to live in. They believe they are gods and are above everyone else and that it's their responsibility to make the rules about who lives and dies. Hitler and all the other evil misleaders in history believed the same thing because they listened to the lies of satan and are doing his will to disobey God and destroy his creation. The people who run the world for satan are the ones that are responsible for the climate changes and they get richer and more powerful from it, and then when the world falls apart they blame the cause and the consequences on others and use it as an excuse to kill people. Nothing new under the sun, this is what happens when people constantly reject God and disobey God and are given over to a reprobate mind and believe that evil is good and good is evil. God is not mocked, people reap what they sow in the end. Hell has room for all sinners. Those fools of satan are soon going to be burning in hell and then after God's judgment day on sin they will be burning forever in the eternal lake of fire with satan and the beast and the false prophet and the demons and all the other sinners. They are willing to hate God and others and they hate their own souls and they believe they will reap a good reward because satan has tricked them into believing his lies. Read the Authorized King James Bible for the truth of God and obey God today while you still have the opportunity because otherwise when you die your consequences will be the same as all those other people who disobey God. That's the truth. When you hear the misleaders of the world speaking you can believe that they hate you and that you are their target and that they all want you dead.
Of course the world continues to change every day for the worse, it's a world of sin and the consequences of sin which brings physical and spiritual destruction and death. Why do metal objects rust, why do people get old and die? These are the consequences of sin. When Adam and Eve sinned in the Garden of Eden they cursed the world and brought sin into the world and the consequence for sin is death. Why does Justin Trudeau want to be in the United Nations security council, it's so he can help determine who lives and who dies. His father was a communist and they both believed that the communist Chinese government is the best form of government in the world. The people who are behind the scenes who control the world are all satanic liars who want to murder the rest of the world's population for satan. That's the way the world works, in case you have not figured it out yet. Try learning from history for once. Research Mystery Babylon new world order, Illuminati, Freemasonry, Ordo Templi Orientis, Theosophy, eugenics, Bohemian Grove, Bilderberg group, Skulls and Bones, Georgia Guidestones, strawman birth certificate bond, Project Blue Beam, Project Paperclip, DAARPA, spirit cooking, HAARP and chemtrails, electronic mind control weapons, directed energy weapons, Monsanto, planned Parenthood and eugenics programs, Mark of the Beast, the  woman who rides the beast, dagon fish God Pope, Vatican assassins, the black Pope and the Jesuit generals, false flag operations, black ops, Lucis Trust, United Nations agendas 21 and 2030, Codex Alimentarius, and the like.
We are being deceived by satan and his followers all the time for the single purpose of the destruction of creation and God.
Moderna was IG Farben who made the cyanide that Hitler used to kill the Jews and now they have made a vaccine for the coronavirus flu. IBM made the identity cards for the Jews so Hitler knew who to exterminate and now the world governments are going to give identification cards and numbers to the people of the world for the vaccines they get. Bill Gates has developed an identification number system that will be used to keep track of everyone and keep the world under control by the devil and his Mystery Babylon new world order misleaders for the end purpose of sending everyone to slaughter. Bill Gates's father was running the planned Parenthood campaign for the abortion of innocent human babies to depopulate the world. IBM gave the operating system to Bill Gates's mother to give to Bill so he could make the Microsoft system work to brainwash people and to data mine their lives so they could create a database for everyone so they would know everything about people and be able to control them and eventually kill them. 
Bill Gates and others like him are liars and murderers and they are members of Lucis Trust Theosophy Hegelian dialectic system which is a satanic belief system for the destruction of creation.
All those evil people are in control of the drug world and everything else that they have to do with to destroy creation. If people believe anything that the evil government and their evil bosses and cohorts say they are the real foolish ones.
Every statute law is a genocide law. Do you get it yet, they can't be trusted and they want you dead.
There's more to the issue than this, but this is a good start for your education of how the world works.
How many millions of innocent human babies have been and are being killed by the abortion sacrifices to the devil every day and how come nobody mentions it and tries to stop it? People are blind and insane sheeple lemmings being lied to and led to slavery and slaughter and they don't even know it because they don't love God and obey him. The world misleaders are evil and demon possessed and given over to a reprobate mind and they believe that evil is good and good is evil and believe lies are truth and truth is lies, consequences to follow. Every false religion is about the lies of satan and for the purpose of disobeying God and destroying his creation. That's how the world works.
How many Guillotines are ready to cut off the heads of those who are marked for death by the new world order misleaders agenda for satan? Why did the American government buy millions of rounds of hollow point bullets for their troops and police to use on the American people when the time comes for a one world government, and why are there so many large plastic coffins sitting and waiting nearby larger cities?
Governments and their forces work together to take over the world by force when the time comes and they won't hesitate to murder the billions of people they have been told to kill. They are just waiting for the order to begin the world wide slaughter. Viruses and vaccines are just more weapons of war against the people of the world.
Admit it, you don't really understand how the world really works at all. They and their  bosses own and control the media and just about everything else in the world for satan and his evil agendas. There is only one safe way to deal with all this evil and that's to be a saved Christian who obeys God and then after death they will be in heaven with God and Jesus Christ and the true saints of God. There is no other way to survive for eternity.",1.0,0.0,,GbHocNejNSs,

It took hardwork of countless Environmental researchers and advocates from 2005 to 2015 to work out this agreement where all the nations agreed to it.

USA or china, i and most people would likely conclude china pollutes the environment more than USA
yes we have ""polluted"" the environment more than developing countries. this goes back to my main point, theyre not going to reduce their pollution, this only hurts us developed countries. 
the summary i get from your argument is, the world is going into an abyss of pollution and we have to wait for the developing countries to catchup. then theres no logical reason to wait if truely the world is going into an abyss of pollution. i dont believe the world is going into an abyss of pollution. i and alot of people believe, that the world would fix itself one way or another. you mentioned species extinction, if i recall, according to evolutionist, species were already getting extinct even before humans exist. ive seen other people say scientist prove the climate change is scam. 
im not a climate change denier, but i believe it has been exaggerated so much that i would be more closely related to climate change denier than a proponent. 
im more of a realist. and the reality is, many countries would keep developing and polluting even if you think the world is going into an abyss. 
the best solution is investment in non pollution products and services and efficient energy, these should be promoted. we dont need to stop any of what we produce in the moment, every country should keep doing as they do to improve the life of their people.

Considering that currently, world-wide China is the biggest Greenhouse gas (GHG) polluter, I understand your frustration that the USA and Europe are paying more. However, the problem is that climate change and greenhouse gas emissions are triggered by the total amount of GHG emissions in the atmosphere. Considering the historical amounts emitted, the GHG already out there, Europe and the USA respectively have emitted 25% and 22%, compared to China with only 12.7 %. The USA and Europe have been using their historical emissions to build their current wealth and increase their standard of living. When thinking about that, it is, in my opinion, justified that the EU and USA are currently paying and doing more than China. Further, if we look at the GHG output used to produce consumer goods for the USA and Europe, most often imported from China or similar countries, the USA's and EU's GHG output is even higher. But I agree with you that also China will have to reduce its current emission if we want to prevent catastrophic climate change. I think we will have to find a way to allow developing nations to increase their standard of living and lift their population out of poverty, while still decreasing GHG emissions globally. This is the challenge for the next 30 years and I strongly believe that we need international cooperation, such as the Paris agreement to achieve this goal. Climate change as a global issue cannot be solved by an individual country. If every country only focuses on its own benefit, it is probable that the world and its societies as we know them will go down. And for me at least this is not an alternative. 

But why is climate change bad? In the last few decades, we have seen an amount of extinction of species comparable to mass extinction periods in world history. We experienced an increase in natural disasters such as hurricanes and droughts, and shifting of climate zones, allowing soon for wine production on the British isles. Why would a few degrees more change something? A few degrees present the difference between climate zones, and we don't know when we reach a point of no return triggering ecological chain reactions making damages to our environment irreversible. The earth's ecological systems are complex and we don't understand them fully, but let me ask a question: If you don't really know how to disassemble a car, would you take some screws out of the engine and hope it would not change anything or would you rather not take that risk?",0.0,1.0,,5THr3bFj8Z4,

That means that our current CO2 levels are the result of Earth's overall temperature 800 years ago.  World leaders have convinced their dependents that this works in the reverse order, relatively quickly, and that we are to blame, so that they can tax us out of a false shared guilt in order to be able to afford to ""fight"" climate change, an unstoppable natural cycle.

Period of Record
417,160 - 2,342 years BP

Methods
In January 1998, the collaborative ice-drilling project between Russia, the United States, and France at the Russian Vostok station in East Antarctica yielded the deepest ice core ever recovered, reaching a depth of 3,623 m (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Ice cores are unique with their entrapped air inclusions enabling direct records of past changes in atmospheric trace-gas composition. Preliminary data indicate the Vostok ice-core record extends through four climate cycles, with ice slightly older than 400 kyr (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Because air bubbles do not close at the surface of the ice sheet but only near the firn-ice transition (that is, at ~90 m below the surface at Vostok), the air extracted from the ice is younger than the surrounding ice (Barnola et al. 1991). Using semiempirical models of densification applied to past Vostok climate conditions, Barnola et al. (1991) reported that the age difference between air and ice may be ~6000 years during the coldest periods instead of ~4000 years, as previously assumed. Ice samples were cut with a bandsaw in a cold room (at about -15°C) as close as possible to the center of the core in order to avoid surface contamination (Barnola et al. 1983). Gas extraction and measurements were performed with the ""Grenoble analytical setup,"" which involved crushing the ice sample (~40 g) under vacuum in a stainless-steel container without melting it, expanding the gas released during the crushing in a pre-evacuated sampling loop, and analyzing the CO2 concentrations by gas chromatography (Barnola et al. 1983). The analytical system, except for the stainless-steel container in which the ice was crushed, was calibrated for each ice sample measurement with a standard mixture of CO2 in nitrogen and oxygen. For further details on the experimental procedures and the dating of the successive ice layers at Vostok, see Barnola et al. (1987, 1991), Lorius et al. (1985), and Petit et al. (1999).

Trends
There is a close correlation between Antarctic temperature and atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (Barnola et al. 1987). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows that the main trends of CO2 are similar for each glacial cycle. Major transitions from the lowest to the highest values are associated with glacial-interglacial transitions. During these transitions, the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 rises from 180 to 280-300 ppmv (Petit et al. 1999). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows the present-day levels of CO2 are unprecedented during the past 420 kyr. Pre-industrial Holocene levels (~280 ppmv) are found during all interglacials, with the highest values (~300 ppmv) found approximately 323 kyr BP. When the Vostok ice core data were compared with other ice core data (Delmas et al. 1980; Neftel et al. 1982) for the past 30,000 - 40,000 years, good agreement was found between the records: all show low CO2 values [~200 parts per million by volume (ppmv)] during the Last Glacial Maximum and increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations associated with the glacial-Holocene transition. According to Barnola et al. (1991) and Petit et al. (1999) these measurements indicate that, at the beginning of the deglaciations, the CO2 increase either was in phase or lagged by less than ~1000 years with respect to the Antarctic temperature, whereas it clearly lagged behind the temperature at the onset of the glaciations.

Carbon dioxide has increased to 406.17 parts per million, the highest level in 650,000 years. Since 1880, average global temperature has risen almost 1°C, and 16 of the 17 warmest years on record have occurred since 2001. Artic ice is decreasing 13.3% every 10 years. In 2012, Artic summer sea ice shrank to a record low. Land ice is decreasing 287 gigatons every year. Sea levels are increasing 3.4 mm each year. Global average sea level has risen 178mm over the past century. As this continues, the effects on our environment will become more pronounced: weather patterns will change across the globe, bringing flooding to some areas and droughts to others. Hurricanes and severe storms will increase in power and frequency. In December 2015, an agreement was drafted to address the damage we are causing to the planet, to limit the global temperature rise to well below 2°C above the figure when records began, to limit the amount of greenhouse gasses emitted by human activity, and for richer countries to help the poorer ones achieve these goals. 195 nations signed the Paris Agreement. As of late 2017, the US – who are responsible for 15 per cent of global carbon emission – withdrew.

It should be clear to all now that those obsessed with power, profit and wealth above everything else that the world on its present trajectory is on very borrowed time. Money, power, control and self interest are at the very heart of our present globalists political, financial and economic elitist system, not preserving planet Earth or the human experience for the majority and where psychopaths and sociopaths come into very easily. For it is now clear that only humankind in the majority and not the top 10% elites can save humanity in the long run, as political and business leaders are the very ones who are destroying the planet in reality when total realism is used. Therefore only the 90% who will take the brunt, can save the planet, as the other 10% are basically insane in doing nothing meaningful that will stop the rot in time – as they like their steady rich state that they prize above everything in their mindless world and to hell with the rest of us. Time has therefore come to put an end to all this madness before it is far too late to return to human normality.

This is also how you calculate the temperature of the subsurface, underground, temperature gradient, below which the temperatures never change but above which, temperatures change with the seasons, just as they do above ground.
