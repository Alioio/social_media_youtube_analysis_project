Instead do something to make sure ocean currents don&#39;t change and the heat in the middle of the country doesn&#39;t cause a more southern prevailing winds. When the methane is released from the permafrost it will be a tipping point without recovery until nature can turn the Co2 back into oil under the deserts of the world . Imagine being a scientist these days and watching clowns like Trump pretend they have the magic brain that knows all wisdom . I am not American , I am not in USA but we are in this together , please seek the truth and then vote Get this rogue group of gangsters out of your Whitehouse and DOJ .",UC2x8ub80v2dMEmgBFNmuAAw,0,UgyIWIFNvkeYwKAxBvV4AaABAg,jPKo2W6pQQA,2020-09-14 22:26:44

This illustrates the importance of having a relationship with Christ and relinquishing sovereignty over your life and letting him be Lord and Savior of your life.<br /><br /> It can be an uncomfortable topic, It can ruffle feathers, but we must realize that this is an eternal decision, this is a decision and a lifestyle choice that will have consequences trillions of years from now.<br /><br />2 Corinthians 5-7 Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves.

However to be fair in multiple interviews I&#39;ve heard with experts on NPR, they have mentioned that contributing factors to the situation are fire suppression practices and the excessive build up of fuel, as well as a growing population expanding into areas that have a normal fire ecology which previously didn&#39;t create an issue because they were uninhabited by people. However there is consensus of the overarching role of climate change making the fires much more numerous and intense, and while every year may not be this bad, we can expect to see the average fire season only get worse from here. Let&#39;s also keep in mind Trump is in bed with the fossil fuel industry and their &quot;science&quot; shows that there is no climate change, so of course he is not going to say anything contrary to that (although recently it has been coming to light that oil companies were in fact aware of climate change for decades but ran campaigns of misinformation).",UCcW7v47IhU2m5MpWErPxRsA,0,UgzSxDWjpCoZ4CEnG-N4AaABAg,jPKo2W6pQQA,2020-09-14 22:26:44

Forest management agencies in the United States have always used drones to inspect the burning of forest fires, and drones are also widely used to explore the first flames and high-risk areas in the forest for early deployment. The drone can still operate at night and in the case of unclear vision, so it can shoulder heavy responsibilities. It is reported that the internal affairs department dispatches about 10,000 drones every year, and its use has become the norm. <br /> <br />The Trump administration ordered all drones purchased from China to stop taking off, even if they are used, they must be specifically approved to avoid violating the prohibition rules. In addition, it is reported that some UAVs made locally in the United States are also banned because they have components from China. Even the additional wildfire detection software purchased from China has also been suspended and the transaction has not been completed. The forest management authority can only send people to the forest and fire sites to complete the work. The road is blocked, the work is dangerous, and the lives of people are sacrificed at any time. Therefore, efficiency is greatly reduced and wildfires are even more out of control. <br /> <br />Therefore, some foreign media pointed out that the Trump administration&#39;s ban on the government&#39;s use of Chinese drones is also one of the reasons for the increasing wildfires.",UCI1XK2CEq7AnFN3w9i4ICiA,0,UgwH7WvSpyBliG_qmih4AaABAg,jPKo2W6pQQA,2020-09-14 22:26:44

When a green house gas enters the upper atmosphere like carbon dioxide ( which has a very long cicle in the air before it is turned into deposits) that causes sunlight to be trapped which melts the polar ice caps. The same polar ice caps that reflect a large sum of said solar radiation. That decreased surface area results in more heat being trapped in our oceans that increases the water vapor content in the atmosphere. This leads to more solar radiation being trapped in our atmosphere which in turn melts more our ice caps which in turn raises our ocean levels which in turn increases the absorption of solar energy which in turn raises global heat levels. This continues to repeat over and over until human intervention such as carbon emissions are no longer needed to sustain the feed back loop. This has already happened for our climate to get better would require two things.<br /> 1: a world wide stop of ALL carbon emissions from every source.<br />2: a world wide start of carbon containment (algie farms where the byproduct is then deposited back in the earths crust.<br />If any of you absolute idiots can guarantee that this will happen then you are a deluded moron and I pity you.

Trump needs to have a long walk through the dry grasslands in the foothills of the Sierra mountains. It is the drying out of those grasslands that make it so easy for foreign and domestic would-be terrorists to start wildfires at local levels during Santa Anna wind episodes. <br /><br />Dry grassland fires smoulder unseen for days, hidden from view until sparked by winds. <br /><br />Trump could easily sign an Executive Order permitting the cost of plowing fire breaks in those privately held lands as a dollar for dollar federal income tax deduction. He could create a national force of climate change warriors to be used as builders of access and egress safety trails into areas close to housing developments to enable rapid deployment of fire responders to put out fires quickly and to enable a second escape mechanism in case of rapid fire spread. <br /><br />He could use some of his Defense budget to create a massive fleet of aircraft for ferrying fire retardant and water to fires to put them out early before they reach towns and villages. <br /><br />He could order the IRS to grant tax exemptions to private businesses or private citizens who get trained as wildfire fighters. He could give permission for these businesses and citizens to deduct all costs related to recruitment, training, equiping, transporting, housing and feeding these fighters as a dollar for dollar federal income tax exemption. <br /><br />What has he done instead? Nothing, except to spread a nonsense theory about raking the forest floors like Finland does. <br /><br />Finland does not rake its forests. It does require that clearcutting be followed by cleaning and reforestation. <br /><br />&quot;Clearcutting&quot; a forested area refers to harvesting all the trees in a patch of forest. Clearcutting and the attendant stripping of bark can leave a large unnatural combustible biomass if not removed. <br /><br />When all trees have been harvested, de-barked and transported away, what is left is a denuded earth that will produce grassy vegetation that will die out, dry out and build into a highly combustible carpet that will quickly send fire through, over and beyond itself. <br /><br />Cleaning the sites of clearcut forests should be done according to the contractual agreements between the owners of the land (the public) and the contracted buyers who take away the products - the trees. <br /><br />If Trump&#39;s government has not enforced the cleanup from past contracts or during his administration, that makes him responsible for the combustible biomass cleanup. <br /><br />He has the authority and the responsibility to repair the damages caused by Federal contracts, including the planting and care of replacement trees.<br /><br />The effects of the Japanese beetle infestation of California&#39;s forests for years left lots of dead trees. On Trump&#39;s federal lands, remember? That danger came from overseas, but Homeland Security has ignored it during Trump&#39;s tenure. Trump uses any argument at hand to punish States in which citizens voted against his candidacy. He has set a clear precedent for future Presidents to do that. The people living along the Southern coasts of the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico must remember what they are doing to their own security by praising Trump&#39;s abuse of Presidential power when he uses it to create vindictive punishments against States. If Trump has done it against California, Oregon, Washington and Colorado, why can&#39;t other future Presidents do it against Florida, Georgia, North and South Carolina, Mississippi, Louisianna and Texas? <br /><br />After all, what is to stop a future President like Trump from deciding he is not going to use FEMA funds to help hurricane and oil spillage prone States until they remove all structures from within three miles of their oceanic shoreline and restore all the beaches and wetlands completely. <br /><br />If Trump gets away with it, so can others.",UCPHlh5xy9YBHrtJId3ej7Fg,0,UgypLNvIW87MBL2jNCV4AaABAg,jPKo2W6pQQA,2020-09-14 22:26:44

If things were going to change we would actively be constructing thousands of air scrubbers, these structures are the size of a water dam, we have yet to do that. The majority of Americans use an combustible engine for transportation only because that&#39;s all that they can afford our society keeps us destitute. I&#39;m not surprised. Trump doesn&#39;t care because he won&#39;t be around when the most severe events take place he‚Äôll be long gone dead, goes to show you he don&#39;t care about his children or his grandchildren because it&#39;s their future not his so he wants nothing to do with it.",UCXwcTdKOryu9lmHCPQgo3uQ,0,UgyCL0B2RxKePFhfBm54AaABAg,jPKo2W6pQQA,2020-09-14 22:26:44

At first I did and yes, there are fire&#39;s BUT I know there are fire&#39;s everywhere BUT fire&#39;s SMELL like fires and it doesn&#39;t. In the area&#39;s that are NOT near fire&#39;s there shouldn&#39;t be this haze or over case. Someone needs to check the air and see what&#39;s in it, trust me I know these crooks...they want all of us to be sick and get cancer. Why? For profits. <br />In the Sonoma, Napa Redding, Red bluff, Sata Rosa and all the other surrounding areas which showed an oblong egg like shape where the fires were.. it was the year before last...I think, I really can&#39;t remember if it was last year or the year before last the chief firefighter said on the radio that there&#39;s no way that simultaneously that these fires could have been ignited all at one time unless it was arson!!!! <br />I ran home to listen to the News because they said the fire chief was going to speak on the News and he did not... why? because somebody high up that owns these radio stations said that he could not speak. If I&#39;m wrong, then why would they say that he would speak on the 6 pm News and then not appear on the news at 6:00 pm? <br />Someone can investigate and talk to the chiefs firefighters and somebody knows something and will start speaking out because these guys know something NIT RIGHT and It&#39;s not normal or natural...they&#39;ve been firefighters for a long time and they know and we Americans need to get to the bottom of this. It is by DESIGN, they are making money, insurances are cheating the homeowners and not paying them out to rebuild their homes...it&#39;s an all around scheme for profiting the ELITE! People have used up all their reserve money, maxed out their credit cards, they are losing their homes AGAIN, I&#39;m sick of it!<br />Please I&#39;m a taxi driver and I pick up all these young kids that have cancer, cancer, cancer and all these different ailments and it&#39;s not natural!!!! We all NEED TO STOP PLAYING THE DEMOCRATS AGAINST THE REPUBLICANS AND THE AFRICAN AMERICANS AGAINST WHITES IT IS US AGAINST THE ELITE AND THERE IS WAY MORE OF US THAN THERE IS OF THEM AND WE&#39;VE GOT TO PUT A STOP TO THIS!!! <br />CHANGE THE LAWS TO STOP LIFE LONG POSITIONS IN THE WHITE HOUSE WITH THESE CROOKS. THEY ARE SELLING US DOWN THE TUBS. <br /><br />PEGGY GO TO <a href=""http://change.org/"">CHANGE.ORG</a> AND START A PETITION TO CHANGE THIS TO STOP ALL THE CORRUPTION. THAT&#39;S THE ONLY WAY WE CAN COMBAT ALL THIS CORRUPTION.<br /><br />I KNOW IM RUBBING SOMEONE IN THE WRONG WAY BECAUSE MY PHONE IS BEING MESSED WITH. I READ what I wrote and it&#39;s all wrong, misspelled words and it&#39;s just not what I wrote exactly. <br /><br />Trust me I take enough time out of my day to write something to stop the corrupt ELITE.<br />¬†@Take America Back From Is—èael¬† take America Back...you are right. I knew we all lost major jobs in the US but wow! And I know we are going though a major depression due to tRUMP, he let it all tumbled downhill fast. <br />This is an Elite move. <br />Remember when he first got in office the first 6 months he had a secret meeting with a bunch of rich people and told them that they just all got a raise. <br />Someone secretly recorded it and I believe it still might be on YouTube. <br />He&#39;s a father of lies, a crook and ALL for the elite money. The good old boy&#39;s. <br />They are all Crooks and as soon as we all start understanding that WE MIGHT be able to take the time to write a position to change the LAWS (on change.org) to STOP THE LIFETIME POSITIONS IN THE WHITE HOUSE. THEY ARE ALL SOLD OUT TO THE LOBBYIST ELITE. <br /><br /> IN REFERENCE TO COVER, even the people who work in the Medical field, Cisco, Facebook and all the <a href=""http://dot.com/"">dot.com</a> companies have all invested in all the big pharmaceutical companies and that&#39;s why they ALL take a mean game in reference to taking the vaccine because they all stand to make a mint. They also have sold out. They don&#39;t care how bad it might be for our health, if it kills half of the population, they just want to make money. They&#39;ve all drank the money bagüí∞ Kool-Aid and they don&#39;t care about anything else but PROFIT. <br />EVERYONE needs to watch the movie called &quot;All the money in the world&quot; that&#39;s the mindset these people are in and God don&#39;t like ugly. We are all suffering for the FEW WE ALLOW to affect us all because all we want to do is Baker and fight against one another instead of trying to be proactive and get these Crooks out of the White House and help change the law to do so. <br />I&#39;m am 62 years old and have lost everything do to Cancer so I am playing catch-up just to get by but I work tirelessly on a daily basis to try and post different posts to try to wake people up. <br />I&#39;m tired but I am alive to tell the story on what the elite is doing to us to make money off of making us sick. <br />Look up on YouTube &quot;VICE-killing cancer&quot;<br />They&#39;ve got a almost 45-day cure by using immune therapy and I&#39;ve talked to other scientists/biologists who tell me they can do it with stem cell therapy. I did it with herbs AND YET, we still are using the barbaric chemotherapy on our loved ones including children and that is unforgivable, I believe. The torcher we are still allowing because we are too busy. Well NOW, most of us aren&#39;t and someone who has money must HELP write petitions to HELP change the law to help stop the use of chemotherapy versus using stem cell therapy and immune therapy to beat cancer. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!!! ALL FOR PROFITING THE WEALTHY. <br /> Look up HARP by Anonymous. Look up geoengineered clouds by Anonymous also. Bill Gates and the Wealthy are behind the toxic chemicals they put in our water, food, air we breath and it&#39;s all for PROFIT-ing they Wealthy and WE THE PEOPLE SIT LIKE SITTING DUCKS, FIGHTING ONE ANOTHER ABOUT BACLK AND BROWN, BLUE AND RED...REALLY!

The rise of militias and the counterprotests and counter culture are in response to this as well as the frankly, dishonest medias portrayal of information.

I sat out 2016 not able to vote for Hillary after she characterized Trump supporters as deplorables, although Trump's background did not convince me he would be able to govern as not business is a democratic enterprise. I also had my doubts about the direction for the Democratic party. The politics of race, gender, and sexual preference (Identity Politics) is so wrong headed and divisive that I won't be a party to it. There is nothing new or progressive about the current Democratic party politics. There is nothing ennobling or sanctifying about the current cancel culture. I find it very sad to see the USA fascinated with European dreams of √©galit√©, Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Karl Marx. Europe is committing suicide, the political leftists and their NGO's promote economic migration to Europe overwhelming Europe's social welfare systems putting very different cultures and values into collision. Civilizations die or don't you know? Western civilization is not eternal or infinitely malleable, it can be broken and replaced. Power knows no vacuum, and if you don't have strong values and anything goes, someone else more determined will impose their values. Must children of the Enlightenment be told, only in the West are societies as just and fair as our own. What the so-called ""progressives"" offer is not new, it is an old illiberalism that when taken seriously not merely immature iconoclasts playing at revolution. What is offered by these young democratic socialists is no substitute for the values of individual liberty and we must be opposed to collective group-think and political correctness.

Most scientists including me agree that man makes a contribution. But the devil is in the details. Some believe that man's contribution is large, some believe it is not so large, almost all agree the planet is getting greener. It is much easier to measure color change from space than it is measuring sea level or surface temperature. Much easier to measure the temperature in upper layers of the atmosphere. Water is the great wild card and is very hard to model ... water in all states, vapor, liquid, and solid. Water is a very peculiar substance. At room temperature and 1 atm pressure it should always be a vapor (according to our models) What makes water so hard to estimate its properties is precisely why it is essential for life. Water forms very strong bonds called hydrogen bonds ....it is the strong hydrogen bonding that gives water strange properties. Water has low molecule weight (18) ... should be a gas ....CH4 (mole wgt 16) and is a gas at room temperature ... Mars has very little water vapor and no oceans on the surface. Mars is easier to model ... tho not perfect (too many sand storms) We spent years trying to understand hydrogen bonding better so we could better model those substances with strong hydrogen bonding ... Now, most of the time we take measured properties for those similar substances with various degrees of hydrogen bonding and use parameterized statistical models to estimate physical properties. By the way it took me a long time to admit out models are not as good as we'd like to believe ... kinda frustrating, but the data on temperature change flatten out unexpectedly over the last 25 years ....and nature is the final judge.",UC2bCxJ_Q3skQqjDUrnTEi3Q,1,Ugx-j1TpolryhV07LXR4AaABAg,jPKo2W6pQQA,2020-09-14 22:26:44

We aren&#39;t a bipartisan system, we&#39;re a United country. Biden as opposition or not, a president should not be held to the standard of Messiah as Trump is by his supporters.

Until early 2000, it was impossible to cultivate tropical fruits, coffees, bananas, and other tropical related plants becasue temperature and climate requirement were not met. But after 2000s, people were able to cultivate the plants without problems. Guess why becasue there was a change in a climate in the region due to increase of CO2 which mostly came from China. This kind of change requires a millennia of time. This happened way too quickly. Native fish population is almost gone . We have more of tropical fish that we cannot consume. Typhoons are more intense than previous year and this will get worse becasue there is more water. The ice cap that is melting in North pole and Green land. They are not coming back.

Yes, wildfires can sometimes be started by these arsonists, but the reason why the fires are out of control and are spreading so quickly is because of our changing climate. One of the major factors being rising temperatures evaporating more moisture from the ground, which in turn makes the vegetation in the forests more flammable. Luckily most of these fires are found quickly so they can be controlled but by no means does that mean we should shrug off the underlying issues. I don‚Äôt need the media to tell me what the widely studied scientific data has already proved.",UCPBGFLfzBV-nvbdlwk-awQQ,1,UgwK94XHXTRHEym-8Ex4AaABAg,jPKo2W6pQQA,2020-09-14 22:26:44

It prove the point that a majority of these fires are due to arson. Most fires going on in America right now aren't that large so why does it matter if its 1 acre or 5? Does it really take corporate media to tell you that its arson for you to believe it?

Trump is supposedly so wealthy and rich. So why isn&#39;t Trump paying for his own legal lawyers and case. Trump won&#39;t give his tax returns so American citizens should not be on hook to pay for Trump rape case. Thus, their are other cases same and or similar against women.. Is America responsible for those too, all 19 other cases?? Absolutely NOT. But Trump don&#39;t want to help American citizens and their families to keep roof over their heads nor food on their table, nor health care, nor nothing too protect American citizens with the deadly corona virus outbreak rinse Jan. Trump has Don little of nothing to provide safety equipment, more money to state and local government to fight epidemic nor to secure our elections that Russia is interfering with to get Trump re-elected. Money is needed to secure our children&#39;s safety in schools, teachers safety and safety of all our teachers and essential people including our doctors and nurses during this terrible deadly plague as Trump admitted it was on tape during Woodward interview since Jan . our roads and bridges are in dyer need of repairs. Our small businesses need help, I mean community cities small business and not the big corporate business that Trump and Republicans and especially much in the Treasury Secretary been giving the monies to the big businesses that really are not suffering as small businesses are.

He‚Äôs also made numerous racist remarks according to aids and many others. We also have this thing called the 1st amendment which gives us the right to freedom of speech and protest even if you don‚Äôt agree with what people are protesting. Violence of any kind or destruction of property is not a right and should be stopped. Trumps federal officers were clearly shown on video footage arresting peaceful protesters who were not doing anything wrong. That‚Äôs called fascism and is not tolerated here. All you people here can muster is some idiots starting cars on fire or trying to destroy a court house.

Facts, 4 UNKNOWN sources were the ones privy to supposed disparaging remarks. 10 NAMED sources have said that he never said that. As far as racists go Donald Trump has NEVER made remarks about black people in general, but was adored and loved by Jesse Jackson, (who actually recognized his contributions to black America), and Al Sharpton. The minute he became a republican he was a racist. He NEVER said that there were fine people in the white supremists in Charlottesville, instead he was referencing the confederate statue and stated it shouldn‚Äôt be removed and there many fine people on both sides. Unfortunately, many have started to believe half truths that are taken way out of context for their political gain. Riots were started in liberal cities with liberal mayors and/or governors. For months the liberal media reported that president Trump was using ‚Äúgastopo‚Äù tactics in response to clear domestic terrorism. Many of these democrat leaders refused to step in or allow for federal aid but instead allowed sacrifice of many of their own constituents, most of whom were black, for political gain. After the RNC they came to realize that it was not working their favor due to poll results. I could go on, but if you would like a real conversation as to why we see things so differently I will be open to discussion.

See when there was slash burns and tree planting the trees had a better chance for survive with maxima growth, but when the forest management stopped doing those very things timber, fish, and wildlife suffered and forest fires happened more often due to dry seasoned wood being left behind in the new forests. At the same time forester workers lost jobs and it was due to politics verses the working man, same thing happened on the hole west coast. So as far as can tell Trump is correct about poor forest management on the west coast but the fires as of late is due to arson that the democrat&#39;s on the west coast is covering up and blaming climate change instead of what it really is, the people know what&#39;s really going on here and there afraid to say the truth the mob may turn on them and they may lose there homes, lives, or even there children.

Heath are used to be very cheap and affordable and good quality in the US, maybe when it was more a free market and not corporatist monopoly. With university education being accessible to everyone the quality of the degree will fall, with propaganda being part of the degree or dumbed down courses such as gender studies, black history studies, diversity studies, essentially Marxist propaganda. The idea of university degrees was to say you achieved something that most people haven't or can't, an intellectual achievement above the average. When it because for everyone and instead was considered a form of education to make everyone equal, it just tried to make them the same, when people are not as some are naturally more intelligent. I have a degree in engineers, a hard subject that not everyone has the aptitude for, but if you wanted everyone to pass engineering you'd have to dumb it down and then the degree becomes useful and the real world value of the degree is diminished.

I think human caused global warming to be a religious doctorin, as terms such as ""climate denier"" is used which is very unscientific, since science is part of proving and disproving a theory, so the other point of view should be censored, which suggests it's political. The term ""anthropogenic climate change skeptic"" would be more reasonable. Science seems to be now pure empiricism, so just observing what is already doctorin instead of thrashing out new theories when something contradicts the sacred doctorins. Much of science has become descriptions and not explanations, so they don't know what is going on in some fields and fudge it with things like dark matter, uncertaintity principle, string theory. The average IQ has been falling since the industrial revolution so that must be a factor science people with the intelligence of who would have been school teachers back in the day are now scientist, so these midwits will not want to rock the boat, suggesting new principles and keep the status quo being more like middle managers.

The reset involves digital currency to be the primary currency to use to buy goods. The Covid lockdowns are pushing for this to happen. The problem with the idea of a cashless society is that it‚Äôs not only easier to track down your purchases. It‚Äôs also a system that can be shut down at any time via cpu controls, terrorist action or war action with use of electrictral magnetic pulse. These are some of the concerns with digital currency and a digital world overall. It really depends how you feel on the subject. For me I believe the push from the elites to go in this direction is dangerous and they are using fear from the public to do this. The lies of the world ending in 12 years and using climate change as the reason is something Trump is very familiar with. This is why he said what he said. Because he knows the direction the elite are going with this and he is not interested in Americans getting involved in this because it requires the death of the dollar. The dollar is what Americans work for to buy goods and services. Trump was on a plan to save the dollar until Covid came. Trump knows that in order for these fires to start in the way they have that it‚Äôs due to a bunch of arsons. Eventually they will be caught.

Here are the facts on found by scientists interviewed by National Geographic. National Geographic reported four months ago that the ocean level has risen 14 millimeters from 2003 to 2019. Now you don‚Äôt believe that someone said that the earth will end in 10 to 12 years. AOC has been telling people that the world will end in 10 to 12 years in a couple of interviews. The Dems backed her up on this. Climate change is being hyped up and politicized. This is a big problem. They are taking a cyclical event in climate change and turning it into the end of the world so we have to sacrifice freedoms in order to ‚Äúsecure the world.‚Äù Now the levels of carbon emissions are higher than normal but just how high is it? Its a fart in the wind. Politics are making us believe it‚Äôs a much bigger problem.

It‚Äôs not as high as the claim is. Climate change is a world wide phenomenon. It is not broken into sections of the world. They said it‚Äôs happening all over the world.

Now if anyone says that even during the winter that the forests will still burn in the west then I‚Äôm calling shenanigans. There are fires burning close to Canada. Try taking a drive anywhere in that area. It‚Äôs already cold over there and yet fires are happing because of climate change? That‚Äôs BS and I‚Äôm not buying it. If the sun is hot enough to burn trees then it‚Äôs hot enough to cook the animals. If you know anything about science you recreate the situation and you figure out what it takes to burn a tree by the rays of the sun. You can test these things yourself with the dryers tree you can find. You need to know how many degrees it takes to happen. You can actually high school level science to do this. They say lightning hitting trees cause these fires. Okay so how many storm go to the area?

You need to list the affects of climate change. One of them is global warming which of course you know rising sea levels are a topic. So if you go on that topic and based on what Dems are saying then you‚Äôd know they said in 10 to 12 years the world will end. This would actually mean that California would be underwater, the south and also Florida would be underwater much sooner. This means right now at this time you couldn‚Äôt get a 30 year mortgage. The banks would never ever give a 30 year loan out. They wouldn‚Äôt get a return for the remaining 20 years. The world will be over by then. Even in its lesser case on maybe ten feet of water in ten years... insurgence companies wouldn‚Äôt insure the homes. The water wouldn‚Äôt go back down and you couldn‚Äôt get a new home built on the land. Not like New Orleans where there water levels went down. You couldn‚Äôt even get the loan because the insurance companies want no involvement on a home they know would be underwater. They would consider climate change. In the banks not a single property prospectus has eluded to climate change. You can still get a loan for a beach front property.

The affects of the economy falling apart will eclipse Covid. You think lockdowns are saving lives? Lockdowns are meant to slow down the amount of people going to hospitals. They were afraid of how quickly the virus can spread and that hospitals would be flooded which can cause serious problems. This is the number one reason for social distancing and masks. However a third of the people in the US are unemployed. I just also found out that in my state they are calculating that 65 percent of all restaurants and bars will not be opening up again. That is a tremendous amount of jobs to not return to. This is all thanks to fear and lockdowns. So to answer directly to that video... why is president Trump changing his mind? Because a lot of Americans are starting to figure out that while attempting to solve one problem is now creating a bigger problem. Before the people were 99 percent on board with lockdowns and masks. President Trump took the advice of Dr. Fauci and understood that if he didn‚Äôt go this route that every American would hate him for it. People are starting to figure out the problems that will come their way. Trump can start coming out with what he believes based on all the research his team has presented him with.,UCQkpQhOMYXQ27PqWDuaz-vQ,1,UgzrjAlqdAA-XGHbrjt4AaABAg,jPKo2W6pQQA,2020-09-14 22:26:44

But based on what I found there is one thing presidents shouldn‚Äôt do and that is they during a situation that can create a huge panic to make it worse. He did that and I‚Äôm glad for it. Would you rather everyone go through a mass hysteria thinking everyone is going to die? ‚ÄúWhy he fails to protect even his supporters during his insanely dangerous rallies?‚Äù So to answer this question is to bring up the reasoning behind people not wearing masks and maintaining social distancing. The information on Covid as it stands is still an overhyped virus. Is it dangerous? Yes it is. It‚Äôs not the Spanish Flu, it‚Äôs not the Plague, it‚Äôs not even H1N1 or Ebola. It doesn‚Äôt kill younger people and children like the Flu does. You‚Äôd have to look up every stats of other countries without being bias is to the reasons why the numbers are so low as far as deaths. Philippines reported 3,000 something deaths due to Covid. Manila has half the cases as New York but still being a condensed city the death rates are at over a thousand since infection. New York is is at 23,000 deaths. It‚Äôs very suspicious but you‚Äôd have to dig through all information to get an accurate answer on that. I have done the homework and I‚Äôm finding out that this virus is not as bad as the media claims it is. The CDC came out with stats on the virus claiming only 6 percent of the Covid deaths were directly Covid deaths. That‚Äôs 6 percent out of 190,000 thousand deaths. You also have to consider who died. Me personally I bypass the politics and go straight to doctors. A good majority doctors have come out to speak about this virus and how treatable the virus is. CNN has demonized certain treatments except for vaccines which is very alarming because any doctor will tell you that vaccine technology is good. But they will also tell you that vaccines come with risks and have to be tested thoroughly. It‚Äôs best you speak to several doctors on this. Don‚Äôt just call it propaganda. Another argument is that Dem running states are not enforcing the protesters to keep with social distancing and wearing masks. They are also not allowing for voting in person but we can go to a Walmart and shop no problem. It‚Äôs okay to protest and break social distancing but it‚Äôs not okay for Trump to rally.

First off you are blaming Trump for the orchestrated actions of the Left.

It means terrorists groups like Antifa and BLM can have their with American cities. Their actions need to be held accountable. If you was a business owner and you happen to be the worst business owner on the planet... should your workers decide to totally destroy your business by burning the building down because they don‚Äôt agree with you? Absolutely not! I could care less how terrible you are. Trump is not the problem. He did not incite violence.

Where every protest was illegitimate, because rioters showed up to 7% of them. Fuck the rest of the 93%! Where Biden hasn't even condemned the rioters (if we don't count that time he said that they should be prosecuted). You live in a world of fiction, and your superhero is named Trump, and he is gonna save this country even if he has to break all the laws. Where a virus that is so clearly real, has cost 190000+ lives and is affirmed to be dangerous by the commander himself, does not exist. And if it does exist, at least it wasn't 2 million dead. You live in a world where everything Trump does is justified, because you think he wants to do good, and if you want to make an omelette, sometimes you have to nuke a henhouse. The saddest thing is that you live in a world where you tell yourself lies, and the biggest lie is that Trump cares even the smallest bit about you. You are the sucker! You are the loser!

And night flights during the winter are mostly responsible for the warming, as shown in this study published in Nature: https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006Natur.441..864S/abstract The net warming effect can be neutralised simply by rescheduling flights to fly during day, and reducing soot particulates by mixing biofuel with conventional jet fuel, as shown in another study by NASA: https://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/business-aviation/2017-12-24/biofuels-could-reduce-contrail-formation-research-finds I didn't mean to imply that flying aeroplanes creates Global Cooling; only that it creates regional surface cooling (areas where there is pollution there is cooling, even though the earth is warming globally.) The ideal way of measuring the true effects of contrails would be to ground all air traffic globally and then compare surface temperature across regions globally to temperatures _with_ air traffic. Since that's impracticable, the closest thing was that impact study around 9/11/01 when all air traffic in the US was suspended for three days. It showed some areas of the US had warmed during daytime, so it was hypothesized that contrails actually lowered daytime temperatures. However, a follow-up study suggested this was due to clear skies at that time of the year. So, who knows. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrail#September_11,_2001,_climate_impact_study https://web.archive.org/web/20090226192509/http://facstaff.uww.edu/travisd/pdf/climatepapermar04.pdf",UCyzfBxIXKhKNCMAaD22rh4Q,1,UgzEq4BUpgRj-3E3UJ54AaABAg,jPKo2W6pQQA,2020-09-14 22:26:44

Creating clouds of mist using boats, smokestacks, industrial-sized fans, planes, etc, is one way to do it. Another thing is solar reflecting satellites (NOT a giant mirror.

For me it all points to the conclusion that this is what is going to happen when he looses. There are already right wing militias forming through out the US and the NRA is still supporting Trump. I fear there is a real danger the situation escalates and i don¬¥t see Trump calming it down. Trump will never resign. His ego will not allow him to do so. He will pardon his family members and himself as soon as he has to leave the office. But he will refuse to leave the WH. He floated the idea of a third term, why should he give up after the first? And the damage is done in division and hate. There is no trust left anymore between the two parties and their supporters. Trump fellowship believes no science, no common sense, just Trumps lies. They joined his alternate universe and you won¬¥t be able to convince them to leave this bubble. They are all in on weird conspiracy theories and totally deattached from reality. There is no common ground left to base a discussion on. Facts are not shared anymore, everything is polarized. That is Trumps America and it will take a long time to heal. But until FoxNews and right wing media stop adding oil to the flames there will be no healing. Trumpism wrecked the american society! The question pending is if it will be division or destruction.

It&#39;s an excuse to charge people tax in exchange for fear from the weather. Up in British Columbia Canada the Carbon Tax which we pay is not revenue neutral as pitched to us before it was forced upon us. It goes into general revenue and is used primarily to provide low income tax credits. The rest of that carbon tax is unaccounted for and goes into government trough feed to do what they wish like paying their friends and family or hiding scandals. It even has other taxes applied on top of it like some kind of tax heroin for politicians. Our Canadian Federal government now wants to implement a federal Carbon Tax on top of the provincial carbon taxes which also have value added tax GST applied to them already. This will further drain the middle class tax payers of any possible livelihoods. Our Federal Liberal Party of Canada government is also now looking at taxing the value of primary residence, so if you were to move now you&#39;ll just dip right back down into debt working for Justin Trudeau, the man who budgeted 20 Billion in deficit spending and instead borrowed 400 Billion on the backs of the tax payers.

But I'll show you how deep I am and I'll help you make your comment germane..... Mark 12:17 ""Render unto Caesar what is Caesar's and Render unto God what is God's"" The statement that is attributed to Jesus is about how one has to live with certain Earthly systems and how that does not preclude one from still serving God at the same time. It goes a little deeper than what you are saying. He was not just paying taxes but being tested to see what he truly worshipped. Hence the prior mention in Mark 12:15 ""and Jesus knew their hypocrisy and said ""why dost thou attempt to entrap me?"", So effectively by giving Caesar what is Caesar's and God what is God's, Trump can go to jail in his orange jumpsuit and serve the government with his time for his crime and then he can serve GOD by helping the environment and lead by example and show us all how *sweeping* the forest floor will fix forest fires. *BOOM* üí£üí• YO, next time you need somebody to sub in for you with the congregation on Sunday morning, Come holla at a sister!

During the debates, climate change was important to Bernie, not to Joe, not to CNN, not to MSNBC, not to Fox. Joe now believes in climate change so now CNN and MSNBC can as well. Great. What‚Äôs the plan? This time, ask scientists and not being big oil companies and other experts on destroying the climate. I have zero confidence Biden will help solve this problem. Why? Companies that create tons of pollution create huge campaign donations. We need a REAL leader who will work with big oil companies and find innovative ways to wean them off oil into successful renewable energy that can make them way more money than producing oil they cant sell. There is a Huge market to create enormous cash flow and massive job creation. This is the exact moment in history to make this happen. But, we need a leader.

One year its quiet then extreme the next."" That's not a scientific statement nor is that something that could ever be scientifically verifiable. Highly variable weather patterns that some years are extreme, others timid is basically what has happened for millions of years. Any and every weather event that happens people blame climate change, which makes little to no sense. Earth is getting warmer, yes. Ice caps in the north are melting, yes. But if people are going to insinuate every single major weather event that has happened is attributed to man made climate change, I'm going to be skeptical. Most of the science behind this is pretty shitty as well if you look at it. It's just scientists running simulations on computers of weather events with and without global warming all of which assumes certain assumptions and bias. It's not truly a scientific endeavor. It's similar to running a simulation on human behavior rather than studying real human behavior. You would have to have a firm understanding on human behavior and be able to accurately predict it to run an accurate simulation. And we both know humanity can't accurately predict weather events more than a couple days out and even then it's sloppy at times. All I'm saying is we can't know if climate change caused these fires. All we know is arsonists deliberately set several of them ablaze during the hottest month for California. One was set off by a ""gender reveal"" party that used pyrotechnics. Are wildfires more likely due to climate change? Sure, possibly, it makes sense for them to given California's wildifre issue with airflow/pressure giving odd precipitation distributions. But does it CAUSE them? I'd contend no it does not in most circumstances. It's like me going camping and lighting a campfire in a forest during an extremely dry day and it starts a forest fire.

I love science but it seems like many scientific studies, are becoming political and I see this over and over. For example, the lancet published a study to discredit HCQ after Trump recommended and all of fake news media used the, not peer reviewed study to say he was wrong for recommending this drug. That study has been retracted and declared fraudulent, no media updated the public on this, although, many epidemiologists still recommend it.

Raking in the forest refers to clearing underbrush, fire fuels etc laying on the forest grounds. Last week I saw both near Iowa Hill (near Colfax) where the undergrowth was a disaster waiting to happen. In another area the forest floor was clean of all debris with a huge pile of brush waiting to be burned when tempatures go down and humidity goes.

He doesn‚Äôt know anything about nature because he lives in metal and glass buildings and pays people to care for the golf course grass and other features found on the fairway. Trees that are logged are given over 20+ years to grow before they are rotated in the system to be cut and processed into lumber or paper products. In his term he and his team have probably spent more money on a unnecessary upgrade to some aircraft than has ever been allocated to help preserve and protect the national parks and services since the first parcel of land was purchased to create a National Park. Since he thinks that the fires are caused by no one raking the leaves and removing any under brush I vote that he and his family have to spend 2 hours each day raking and removing the under brush to pay the American citizens back for all of the money he lined his family‚Äôs pockets with each time he went to one of his resorts and golf courses which required everyone who was with him to stay there and pay full price for their room and meals.

Though if you rather me actually talk about valid points why don't I? So let's talk about why we are having peaceful/ violent protests? White people are turning a blind eye to police brutality and we shouldn't stand for. Racism is a dying ideal and for a good reason. My brothers and sisters don't need to die for extremely simple things when whites are going above and beyond to receive little to no punishment. How about global warming? Maybe I could do the extremely easy job of listening to all of my experts and actually pay attention. I could promote active ways for renewable energy along with government sponsorship of those working on new sources of renewable energy. I would fund the mail system well, to be sure they have new trucks, the newest systems and plenty of money to get their job done right. The US postal service isn't to be treated as horribly as it is under current administration. Perhaps we could talk about how other country are extorting the United States for goods and services? Is it really fair that russia sends us 60 broken ventilators (that we pay for) and we send them 200 working ventilators for FREE? Deal made by trump with putin myself. If my country is on fire I would put a huge focus on getting it under control. I would help families who lost EVERYTHING to the fires. I would use our so powerful military and get this fire under control. You could make a stupid joke saying ""you going to shoot at the fire with the military?"" Obviously we would use the helicopters, trucks, anything we can to stop our country from burning. They swore to protect and if our biggest threat is the world catching on fire then I don't see why they wouldn't be willing to help. But that's all a dream, because of current laws you must be a certain age to be a president which is understandable but at the same time having a young president wouldn't be a bad idea. It would allow for the new ideas to come through rather than sticking to the old way that don't work. Racism, Coal, prejudism... It needs to change. Our country is divided almost to the point of when Lincoln was president. Is that really want we want? To kill each other? We are Americans! Tall, short, black, white, christian, islam, it doesn't matter. Us being Americans we are brothers and sisters. We all fight the same battle. I'd rather have a serious conversation and explain my points and my ideal, then listen to someone explain their reasons and their understandings, than pick up a gun and shoot a man just because we don't see eye to eye. I love each and every american with my whole heart. We are all gifted and special in our own ways, what ties us is that we are american. We live on the same soil, we fight the same wars. It's one thing to say words it's another to invoke real change. You want me to run for president? Maybe I will. And let's see if we can't change the world for the better. It won't be for many years, because I believe I should have the right criteria to be the president, rather than favorable ideals.",UCABxJTnlEoEDfK0QbkKmn7Q,1,Ugy3mSC5QixIXn8nrM14AaABAg,jPKo2W6pQQA,2020-09-14 22:26:44

Forest fires unprecedented in size and intensity are just one manifestation of rising Green Houses. The air is not even breathable in large cities like San Francisco, Portland and Seattle. Oceans becoming acidified and killing coral reefs, crucial to fish and causing fisheries crashing. Mercury (from burning) coal level making fish dangerous for children and pregnant women. Climate change resulting in species extinction, crop failures from droughts, water supplies frying up. Crop seeds not adapted to climate. Coastal flooding from rising sea levels Flooding and destruction from more severe storms. Increasing wild life (including hunting species) diseases. Starvation of people in third world countries.

For reading, he usually relies on the pictures and his own ""skills"" with a Sharpie... He likes the sets of Sharpies of different colours, but needs help getting the right cap on the right Sharpie when he has finished colouring in his copy of the Bible. He likes to have someone read him the bits about the genocide of the Canaanites, but pees his pants and bursts into tears if he only has one red Sharpie to show all the blood. That's why he chose to infect the Republican Party, because the Party is red like all that blood, and because Pappy Moscow Mitch and Uncle Vladdy Putin both worship the red Russian flag. He still thinks that Vladimir Putin and Vlad the Impaler are the same person, and the best example of national leadership ever.

So far the Trump campaign has announced almost no projected program for the next four years, so Trump, besides being intellectually inadequate, has nothing to debate with Biden. Biden is a far smarter operator than HRC, who failed to expose the absence of any program in Trump's first campaign and let him get away with childish insults padded out with other really infantile rubbish. If Trump doesn't have anything intelligent to say during a debate with Biden he will get buried. Since Trump doesn't have the uh-brain for an exchange of ideas and adult criticism the result is hardly going to be close... It's most likely that Trump will give a very pathetic display of weakness of character, morality and intellect, but I do wonder if Biden won't take pity on Trump and fail to put his fake political career to the sword.

First of all, the reason why deaths are so high in USA is NOT Trump's fault. He did everything he could to mitigate the effect (closing borders despite everyone telling him not to, commencing lockdowns and quick manufacturing of medical equipment). The fact is, America has a HUGE population and lots more people travel between China and America than other places which is why Corona is so prominent in America. Secondly, there is no conclusive evidence that climate change exists therefore what he meant by ""I don't think science knows actually"" is that what they call ""science"" is merely conjecture - see CNN manipulates. That is what they do. It's not your fault that we are all in echo-chambers, that's why I look at both sides and we all need to.

So long as it meets the requirements, it's cheap, efficient, in abundance, doesn't gut our economy or require massive taxation and redistribution of wealth. We did it before with the transition from horse to automobile, from oil lamps to electricity. We can do it again, I have faith in the free market so long as we and the government support and incentivise new energy technology. Instead we don't, we try to gut the current energy industry, tax our citizens and push energy that's not efficient nor in abundance. Solar has issues, wind does, hopefully nuclear fusion but that's still years ahead. Technological innovation sometimes takes times and we're not fully there. We don't want to end up like Germany, read about their push for green energy btw. In the end, I have yet to personally find 1 person who's against trying to have green energy. No one ever said to me "" I want humanity only to be reliant on coal and oil forever"". Instead they agree we need alternatives, but how we get there differs. Personally myself and millions of other Americans, can't afford the Green New Deal or high taxation, ect. Sorry, we need to try an alternative. Think of oil, coal as alcohol, don't cut cold turkey, slowly want off of it. While we're using it, we do d an alternative then slowly want off of it because it's cheaper, more I'm abundance and efficient.

This doesn&#39;t just affect the climate, but also the fish and other wildlife. <br /> If this idiot had any sense, he would realize the forests are too vast to apply raking as a solution. Anyone who has even a rudimentary knowledge of fire mitigation knows that before this dramatic expression of climate caused disasters, fires that burn the leaves and fallen timber was considered desirable since these fires burn quickly and at a cooler temperature. These periodic fires could be managed and even set deliberately with fire breaks and teams to monitor the progress to prevent fires going out of control. This kind of realistic forest management helped to prevent these very hot, destructive runaway fire disasters.

The leftist socialist agenda is to enact the Green New Deal to save the world from &quot;catastrophic&quot; climate change. This is not climate change to most including Trump. Trends are not absolute changes and does not necessarily indicate climate reversals. Climate change is the way mother earth controls climate over a very long period of time, and there is no solid definitive predictions of 100% certainty of the future of our planet. We only have climate models that seem to indicate so. We puny humans have very little influence on mother earth in the big picture. To say &quot;the science tells us&quot; is to give a less than one nanosecond (or less) snapshot of our environment in the span of time of the entire life of this planet.

First of all, the reason why deaths are so high in USA is NOT Trump's fault. He did everything he could to mitigate the effect (closing borders despite everyone telling him not to, commencing lockdowns and quick manufacturing of medical equipment). The fact is, America has a HUGE population and lots more people travel between China and America than other places which is why Corona is so prominent in America. Secondly, there is no conclusive evidence that climate change exists therefore what he meant by ""I don't think science knows actually"" is that what they call ""science"" is merely conjecture - see CNN manipulates. That is what they do. It's not your fault that we are all in echo-chambers, that's why I look at both sides and we all need to.

The fact is, America has a HUGE population and lots more people travel between China and America than other places which is why Corona is so prominent in America.

When you let these trees get old, then the entire forest is the same age and it goes up like tinder no matter if you have cleared areas or not. You may be too young, but the fires of 1988 in Yellowstone National Park are a good example of what not doing fire management can do. All administrations are guilty of this and although people want to blame Trump for this, a history of fires in the West would be a good subject to call up on the internet if you want to see why this keeps happening every summer in the West.

He did everything he could to mitigate the effect (closing borders despite everyone telling him not to, commencing lockdowns and quick manufacturing of medical equipment). The fact is, America has a HUGE population and lots more people travel between China and America than other places which is why Corona is so prominent in America. Secondly, there is no conclusive evidence that climate change exists therefore what he meant by ""I don't think science knows actually"" is that what they call ""science"" is merely conjecture - see CNN manipulates.

All states in this country have used up the majority of their budgets fighting the coronavirus that Trump has totally dropped the ball on. So once that money is used up then you can't fight things like these fires. That's where FEMA steps in. But guess what? They're low on money too. It sounds total stupidity when people bring up Democratic or Republican states. This fool said it'll get better once it gets cool. All in an effort to downplay the fact that climate change is a real thing. Anybody can look over the years and see that climate change is real. Only a moron and an idiot would say it's not. and we have one in the Oval Office. These things were predicted years ago. Decades ago. The only difference is it's happening faster than what they initially predicted. People need to start raising their intelligence levels up and pay attention to what's going on.

There have been repeated calls from Trump, Barr and others to designate antifa as a terrorist organization which Barr has characterized as ""highly organized"". However, academics, legal experts and scholars, among others, argue that antifa cannot be designated as it would be a violation of the First Amendment To the United Sates Constitution and there is no legal authority to designate a wholly domestic organization. A June 2020 study of 893 terrorism incidents in the United States since 1994 found zero murders that were specifically attributed to anti-fascists or antifa while 329 deaths were attributed to right-wing perpetrators. Several analyses, reports and studies concluded that antifa is not a domestic or major terrorism risk and ranked far-right extremism and white supremacy as the top risk.‚Äù -Wikipedia",UCK375EgYEH2l7qEEczqrzQg,1,Ugylgnfrl2Vj-z85ml14AaABAg,jPKo2W6pQQA,2020-09-14 22:26:44

The Jackson County‚Äôs Major Assault/Death Investigation Unit is investigating the nature of the death of the person found, according to Ashland Police Chief Tighe O‚ÄôMeara.

Michael Jarrod Bakkela, 41, was charged with two counts of arson, along with 15 counts of criminal mischief and 14 counts of reckless endangering. On Tuesday, residents called 911 after seeing a man light a fire behind their house in Phoenix around 5 p.m. local time, police said. The witnesses had fled their home ""due to the impending fire,"" the sheriff's office said. When Oregon State Police troopers and Jackson County Sheriff's Office deputies arrived, Bakkela ""was standing close to a very large fire threatening several homes,"" the sheriff's office alleged. The fire eventually merged with the Almeda Fire, which had started about six hours prior in Phoenix, police said. There is ""significant damage"" that police are attributing to the fire allegedly set by Bakkela, Jackson County Sheriff's Office public information officer Mike Moran told ABC News. ""There are numerous homes, many of which are burnt completely, some are just heavily damaged, that are part of the 15 counts of criminal mischief,"" Moran said. Bakkela initially was arrested on Tuesday for a probation violation on an original charge of unlawful possession of methamphetamine. He was charged Friday afternoon in connection with the Almeda Fire. He is currently booked at the Jackson County Jail and will likely be arraigned on Monday. The case has been referred to the Jackson County District Attorney's Office and charges may be modified, police said. Authorities are also conducting a separate criminal investigation into the initial origin of the Almeda Fire. A man was found dead about a mile from that origin point, in north Ashland, police said Friday.",UCK375EgYEH2l7qEEczqrzQg,1,Ugylgnfrl2Vj-z85ml14AaABAg,jPKo2W6pQQA,2020-09-14 22:26:44

Don't watch Fox News either. Watch an unbiased news channel from another country then. What point are you trying to make? All Democrat-run cities have no peaceful protests? Much of the protests are peaceful. What that video shows, are some of the morons who are not interested in peaceful protesting, but anarchy and taking this opportunity to steal. This is also happening in Republican-run Cities as well. Why isn't Trump sending his Secret Police to Republican-run Cities? Same Sh*t going on over there as well... The answer is: Trump wants to make it appear that Democrat-run Cities and States are unable to control protests, which again have been peaceful with the exception of a few instigators. Instigators, such as Trump supporters driving their Trucks in Portland, shooting paintballs, and pepper spray at protestors, and Trump said he supports them.

Humans can only see what their societal norms and values tell them to believe, which thus renders humans unable to form accurate opinions on anything outside this programmed reality.<br /><br />The question of climate change is a very complicated and nuanced one. It would take me many years to develop sufficiently intelligent models in order to make an informed statement on the topic, but I can offer some insights into possible interpretations of the problem. My first point is that humans are inherently subjective beings, which means our perception of the world around us inevitably involves bias, prejudice, and other such factors. We often fail to notice certain aspects of reality because they do not fit in with our worldviews (sometimes called &#39;mental maps&#39;). This subjectivity makes it difficult for humans to understand complex problems such as climate change.<br /><br />A core assumption of humans is that we are the centre of the universe, which means we are able to control our environment. This leads us into conflict with nature and forces us to adapt ourselves in various ways (sometimes by moving) so as not to be destroyed. Humans often struggle against their natural state, whether it&#39;s through technology or other means. Another core assumption of humans is that there exists a &#39;correct&#39; way to live, which means we often make the mistake of trying to force others into our mould. This can be seen in many aspects of human society, whether it&#39;s through religion or politics.<br /><br />Humans also tend to view the world through a dichotomous lens, which means we often fail to see things as they are. We filter information based on our existing beliefs and prejudices; we create false distinctions between things that have no real difference. For example, humans who believe in climate change will always compare it with other phenomena such as &#39;global warming&#39;, but there is no actual difference between these two terms. Humans are also very limited in the scope of their thinking. There&#39;s always so much more to be said about a problem than we can ever conceive of, and this makes us vulnerable to all kinds of errors. We tend to think that our intellectual limitations are normal, when really they&#39;re just failings on our part.<br /><br />Climate change is a very complex problem, and humans are likely to make many errors in their attempts to solve it. This doesn&#39;t mean we should give up trying to understand the issue; instead, we should try even harder. I believe that climate change will be solved either through carefully planned cooperation between nations or through natural selection.",UCOXsoNirT3Uboo6DsW982Sw,0,UgyiqaCnWQ0Fm8I3As14AaABAg,jPKo2W6pQQA,2020-09-14 22:26:44

And that takes us back to John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that WHOSOEVER believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. Ephesians 2:8-9 (KJV) 8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: 9 Not of works, lest any man should boast. So it's only by GRACE that we are saved not by works. Jesus did all the work and gave us GRACE (unmerited favor) as long as we have FAITH (believe) in the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ for SALVATION (trust in his blood).

I sat out 2016 not able to vote for Hillary after she characterized Trump supporters as deplorables, although Trump's background did not convince me he would be able to govern as not business is a democratic enterprise. I also had my doubts about the direction for the Democratic party. The politics of race, gender, and sexual preference (Identity Politics) is so wrong headed and divisive that I won't be a party to it. There is nothing new or progressive about the current Democratic party politics. There is nothing ennobling or sanctifying about the current cancel culture. I find it very sad to see the USA fascinated with European dreams of √©galit√©, Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Karl Marx. Europe is committing suicide, the political leftists and their NGO's promote economic migration to Europe overwhelming Europe's social welfare systems putting very different cultures and values into collision. Civilizations die or don't you know? Western civilization is not eternal or infinitely malleable, it can be broken and replaced. Power knows no vacuum, and if you don't have strong values and anything goes, someone else more determined will impose their values. Must children of the Enlightenment be told, only in the West are societies as just and fair as our own. What the so-called ""progressives"" offer is not new, it is an old illiberalism that when taken seriously not merely immature iconoclasts playing at revolution. What is offered by these young democratic socialists is no substitute for the values of individual liberty and we must be opposed to collective group-think and political correctness. If they aim for Rousseau they will get Thomas Hobbes' nightmare.

Most of what we consider as climate are *sea currents*. If you look at Paris vs California vs Toronto, despite being on the same latitude their temperatures could not be more different. Toronto can reach -20C or lower, when's the last time you've seen -20C in South California ? I can answer that one for you: never. There's no guarantee that a certain action will produce the expected result as sea currents are pretty complex . That said, if everyone on the planet stopped all power output that wouldn't change one damned thing about the fires for quite a while. (years to decades). You also have to be realistic in your solution. We simply don't have a viable way to meet power demands at the moment. What we can do is cut the f-king flammable sh*t around power lines and that would have a HUGE impact, vs essentially NO IMPACT. But don't believe me, look up what firefighters have to say, a lot of them will tell you that certain fires would have been so much less impactful if they simply removed the highly combustible , essentially dead plant life around certain areas. This fact is not in dispute, we KNOW this. What's unbelievable is seeing the democratic governor complain about the fires when it was their idiotic policies that exacerbated the condition and claim as if they have had no control over it.

I'd be very frustrated as well, but probably would direct my blame to another direction, who knows. I guess we can both agree on the fact that the government isn't funding environmental agencies enough, which includes forest fire prevention. And well the thing is even though they did exist before the 70s, CO2 emissions have been increasing exponentially, so it really was only a matter of time until we noticed real life consequences. It's probably only gonna get worse from now on. But what I don't understand is how a lot of people, maybe including you, associate opinions on climate change with politics. Like Reagan and the Republicans made huge steps towards fighting climate change back then, although that's changed a lot these days. I don't even want to think abou the amount of people that don't believe in climate change because their favorite politician said he doesn't either, although he probably had a financial incentive to say so. I'm convinced 80% of politicans or other public figures that deny climate change do actually believe in it, but have been lobbied to not say they do or have some other reaons to mislead their constituents. Anyways, the US should seriously rethink their entire budgeting, there are billions of dollars being wasted in the army for shit like bulk buying 25cl coke cans for 11$ a can and shit like that, imagine those billions being reinvested in services like fire fighting or public transportation.",UCGuqFSCQ9a-OsPxo02Ieszg,1,Ugy-IRxIXSCxJkfNu8F4AaABAg,jPKo2W6pQQA,2020-09-14 22:26:44

Co2 emissions existed before the mid 1970's and we didnt have this big of a problem. The environmentalists here are protecting wildlife habitat more than human beings but they are being overly ridiculous about it. I dont want to stray from the focus in my argument, climate change is climate change but fires that we can avoid by using the federal funds and tax dollars for what they are meant for is a no brainer, my quarrel is with the politicians in the state and the web of progressive entities they spawn that put human lives (and animals) in jeopardy.

And yes I totally agree, it's always a bad idea to jump into a massive endeavour like that without sufficient planning. And also the green new deal isn't exclusively for climate change, it has a large number of progressive national health care reconfigurations that of course cost money, but you have to think of the many long term effects it could have, but that's another discussion. However, if let's imagine you would believe in climate change, don't you think that after being warned by scientists almost 50 years ago and a lot of predictions having become reality we should slowy get our asses up?? I mean you can go read the science behind it, whatever your sources say, the scientific consensus really is that it's true. I'm an engineer who works on projects at a university and I'm extremly certain not a single professor, scientist or doctorate here says climate change is fake, at least the ones I know and even the idea that it's untrue makes people disappointedly shake their heads. There's also just a massive mountain of evidence disproving it, because it's so easy to do! I mean if you want to prove it to yourself you can measure the temperature for years and watch the increase, buy a rather expensive CO2 sensor or as a Californian you could even go and test the pacifics CO2 levels and the acidification that comes with it, I wish I could. Just think about the two futures we have here: so either, climate change indeed is fake and we can continue our lives as we had so far, which would still for example kill off the amazon rainforest, overfish the shit out of the ocean and have a lot of other effects, but still we could eat as much meat as we want and drive the biggest trucks all day long, go on 45min flights over the weekend to the neighboring state without a slither of guilt. But imagine if you were indeed wrong and climate change is realer than even I want it to be: CO2 causes ocean acidification which has already ravaged entire reefs and soon entire oceans, causing the great majority of marine life to go extinct, no more sushi-night for anyone. Without stable weather and cold enough conditions snow and glaciers will cease to form in most parts of the world, which will mean that we don't have any alpine source of fresh water, and slowly everything will have to be desalinated. Rivers will dry out causing entire countries to collapse, agriculture will become a lot more expensive and livestock will become a thing of the past. Projections of sea level rise range up to 9 feet by the end of the century, just imagine basically every single coastal city on earth being deserted, billions of people will be homeless climate refugees and entire countries and parts of US states will be engulfed by the sea. We might not be alive by then but our kids will be pissed if we didn't take that 90 trillion deal back then, because their bill is gonna be a fuckton bigger than what we got on the table right now. Well yeah, so based on those scientific predictions (which might be more gradual than that but also there might be unforseen consequences that could be even worse), I do worry a lot and don't want anyone to have to live through that, espiecially not my kids. I don't know about you, but I'd rather be safe than sorry.

So yes you're actually right, CO2 does only absorb part of the spectrum, but sadly for whatever shepherd convinced you otherwise it absorbs heat which turns it into a so called greenhouse gas. What happens is that it absorbs IR-radiation which causes the molecule to vibrate, which in itself generates heat. Then the molecule releases even more IR-radiation causing even more heat.

And I came to realize over the years that environmental destruction is a serious threat to that utopia of mine and humanities progress overall. Yes it is, but do you realize how tiny a multi-billion dollar industry is in comparison to the oil industry? The Koch brothers alone probably earn more in revenue each year than what the green industry is worth. And seriously, have we set our bar so low?? China, a third world country, the greatest polluter on the planet is barely beating us with pollution and we're happy with that??? We should proudly be miles away from that part of the list. Also China is banning all fuel-run cars by something like 2026 and investing insane amounts of money into renewable energy, because unlike the US gov they actually realize the long term damage they're causing and how negatively that will impact the economy in the future. But US politics always only think around 8 years ahead. Germany is another story, they had this retarded anti-nuclear zeitgeist for the past 40 years, and now they had to shut down the nuclear part of their power grid faster than they could replace it with good alternatives. And yeah they even started using dirtier coal than the normal source. But you can't just choose one bad apple to prove your point, there are so many success stories in the rest of Europe. And look, I get you don't want to believe climate change is real, I just wonder why you want to feel that way. Is it guilt you don't want to have to feel by being ignorant? Or do you not want to give up hearing your car purr when starting the motor? But you probably just haven't seen the change with your own eyes. I'm an expat living in Switzerland and the shit I see here scares me, the speed of it even more. We only have to seasons now, we thought it was an anomaly 10yrs ago but it hasn't changed since. One day it's a rainy, even snowy 10¬∞C day and the next day you wake up to a scorching 35¬∞C. Then in the middle of July it starts snowing for a couple of days. I live close to the one of the largest glaciers in Europe, and alone in the last 10 years I saw how incredibly fast it's melting. This chunk of ice, the size of a mountain with billions of litres of water, gets smaller every day. My favorite hike trail over the glacier that I loved to go on 5 years ago is a lake now, sitting 50 meters away from the new base of the glacier, and those 100 meters of lost ice results in millions of litres flowing into the ocean. We had 6 feet of powder every year, which was always slowly decreasing, and now we got jack shit. I'm glad if I have one good ski day each season these days. And this is a worldwide phenomenon, maybe even you noticed some of that stuff at home. I know my examples might not be very relatable, but then again those billions of lites of glacier water cause 21% of the annual sea level rise, which is gonna displace billions of people sometime during this century, which then again is gonna be a greater economic disaster than any attempt to go green ever has been. Also, you say the green industry was started by fanatical environmentalists, well actually their largest donor is the oil industry, since they want to keep their monopoly and are well aware of the issues and the increasing scarcity of fossil fuels, so they convince you guys to keep on supporting their business as long as they can seel you every last drop of their supply of oil. Read into any article of a climate change denier and you'll find a money trail leading to for example the John Birch society, an organization funded by the Koch brothers that owns media outlets to benefit their companies.

Their energy costs shot up 770%. The bottom line is its too costly and impractical.

Green energy creates much more revenue than fossil fuels, it's a lot more efficient and it would create more jobs than fossil fuels would ever have had.

With anything in science their is uncertainty. However <95% of Climatologist agree that more than 95% of the warming observed since 1950 has been of a result of humans increasing the levels of greenhouse gases like CO2 in the air. The last 6 years were the 6 hottest on record (2016, 2019, 2015, 2017, 2018, 2014) Earth has warmed about 1.1¬∞C or 2¬∞F since 1880, most of that warming talking place since 1980. That warming is taking place 5x faster than natural. A typical ice age recovery would take 5,000-10,000 years to warm 5¬∞C. Earth could be warming at a rate of 20x faster by 2100. Current CO2 levels are at 415 ppmv. For 800,000 years, ice cores show CO2 remaining between 180 ppmv and 280 ppmv. This kept Earth in an ice age for 2 million years. Current CO2 is the highest in 5 million years. Physics tells us the more CO2 and other greenhouse gases are put into the air like CH4, H2O, N2O, and O3, the planet will get warmer. This greenhouse has been on Earth for Billions of years and while other things like Milankovitch Cycles and Solar Output can effect Earth‚Äôs climate. Earth‚Äôs climate will always be determined by the composition of Earth‚Äôs atmosphere. While other natural forces can affect Earth‚Äôs climate, none are large enough to affect Earth‚Äôs Climate as much as humanity. What are the effects of a warmer world?Like anything is science, there is uncertainty. However there is somethings that are known. The Earth will likely warm 4¬∞C to 5¬∞C by 2100 and more than 8¬∞C by 2200. The last time Earth was that hot was during the PETM 55 million years ago. A potential hot house Earth could be coming as humans have delayed an already over due ice age by 100,000+ years. CO2 levels could reach 900+ ppmv by 2100 the highest in 55 million years. The IPCC outlined the result of a 1.5¬∞C and 2¬∞C warming by 2100. And needs to be prevented by cutting emissions by 2030 according to the 2015 Paris Agreement. A warmer world would melt the ice cape, Greenland and Antarctica are losing hundreds of tons of ice per year. Even though it would take thousands of years to melt all of Earth ice even if hothouse conditions are met by 2100, but not all ice melt is needed to see problems. Melting ice would cause sea levels to rise, likely 0.5-2 meters (2-6 ft) by 2100, sea levels are rising at 3 mm a year and could be 10 mm a year by 2100. This would flood major costal cities and displacing millions. More than 90% of the heat created by climate change is going into the oceans. This is breaking heat records for ocean heat content each year. Not only are warmer oceans causing higher ocean acidification and destroying marine life. But warmer oceans evaporators more moisture. For every 1¬∞F warming in the air, the atmosphere can hold 5% more water. This means more heavy rain and snow events. Warmer oceans can be energy more less frequent, but stronger hurricanes. A warmer arctic could slow the jet stream and cause more extreme weather. Like more droughts and floods. A slower jet stream could also lead to more extreme cold events all though in a warmer future, heat will likely beat cold. Extreme Heat waves will get worst, wildfires will be more likely to occur. However despite these some extreme weather events like Tornadoes will likely become less frequent. And when talking about Climate Change. There can be positives. Like more room to yield better crops. Although extreme changes in climate can mess up this processes. And when talking about human induced global warming. We have to talk about climate feedbacks like warmer oceans and melting glaciers could release more greenhouse gases. Climate Change won‚Äôt end the world, but extreme weather will be happening more.",UCNrXngTy7SQf0tDWQ88qefQ,1,Ugwwj2N7o5l6UllvcFN4AaABAg,jPKo2W6pQQA,2020-09-14 22:26:44

Therefore we're not under the law of the old testament. 1 Corinthians 15:1-4 (KJV)1 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures. And that takes us back to John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that WHOSOEVER believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. Ephesians 2:8-9 (KJV) 8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: 9 Not of works, lest any man should boast. So it's only by GRACE that we are saved not by works. Jesus did all the work and gave us GRACE (unmerited favor) as long as we have FAITH (believe) in the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ for SALVATION (trust in his blood). That's the gospel. Jesus said, Ye must be born again to enter into the kingdom.(accept Jesus as your SAVIOR)",UCt5d791kM_Rs4ln-dSGcAIQ,1,UgyQ3IeiyG_Z4s7wmaZ4AaABAg,jPKo2W6pQQA,2020-09-14 22:26:44
