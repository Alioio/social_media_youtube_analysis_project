Perhaps presenting one aspect such as the Nomad War Machine, or perhaps the relation between indigenous ways of seeing the world and Nomadology, or perhaps on the resurgence of nonhuman subjectivity with people like Ian Bogost, Graham Harman, Donna Haraway, Jane Bennett, Karen Barad, and of course Timothy Morton, as many of the are inspired by Deleuze's concepts like singularities and multiplicities. Or, perhaps a video on the thought of Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt, heavily influenced by Deleuze and Guattari. Or perhaps some combination of all three.

I never claimed that humanity is not adding to the CO2 in the atmosphere and I never claimed that CO2 does not have a greenhouse effect. Now try to get this straight in your little mind. My claims that A. The climate sensitivity number is small. Probably between .5C and 1.5C for each CO2 doubling. And B. The temperature effect of added CO2 is base 2 logarithmic. This means we get less and less global temperature increase as we add more and more CO2. So if the climate sensitivity number is 1C, then we would get that first additional 1C by adding 280 PPM. To get the next 1C we would need to add 560 PPM on top of that. And to get the third 1C we would need to add 1120 PPM on top of that. We are not going to be adding those kinds of numbers in the next couple hundred years and we will be running on fusion energy long long before we ever could.

CO2 does not just build more leaves, it builds more of the entire plant. Plants are mostly hydrocarbons and the carbon and oxygen in CO2 are 2/3 of what it takes to make a hydrocarbon. So the entire structure of the plant is enhanced by CO2 fertilization. And having more leaves means that the power source of the plant is enhanced. As a result the plant increases seed production and is able to better withstand drier conditions. So while there is nothing that CO2 can do to reduce the cutting down of forests, it does increase the production of new forest. And one of the things that our satellite data has shown us is that the new forest growth is outpacing old forest cutting now. And while there is still some desertification going on in the world, like in Mongolia and Australia, the majority of the world's deserts are getting greener. Measured as a whole, the satellite data shows large increases in the biomass of the earth in the last 50 years. https://www.thedailybeast.com/climate-change-is-making-deserts-greener",UCgmx2s3MLvgVYVowKGgoosA,1,UgzqC6iRs2aCBjgPOsJ4AaABAg,9Pqp_8XLC6c,2019-05-23 18:47:11

Other experts, more optimistic, think the ultimate food-population collision will not occur until the decade of the 1980s.â 6. Ehrlich sketched out his most alarmist scenario for the 1970 Earth Day issue of The Progressive, assuring readers that between 1980 and 1989, some 4 billion people, including 65 million Americans, would perish in the âGreat Die-Off.â 12. Paul Ehrlich chimed in, predicting in 1970 that âair pollutionâ¦is certainly going to take hundreds of thousands of lives in the next few years alone.â Ehrlich sketched a scenario in which 200,000 Americans would die in 1973 during âsmog disastersâ in New York and Los Angeles. 13. Paul Ehrlich warned in the May 1970 issue of Audubon that DDT and other chlorinated hydrocarbons âmay have substantially reduced the life expectancy of people born since 1945.â Ehrlich warned that Americans born since 1946â¦now had a life expectancy of only 49 years, and he predicted that if current patterns continued this expectancy would reach 42 years by 1980, when it might level out. (Note: According to the most recent CDC report, life expectancy in the US is 78.8 years). 17. In 1975, Paul Ehrlich predicted that âsince more than nine-tenths of the original tropical rainforests will be removed in most areas within the next 30 years or so, it is expected that half of the organisms in these areas will vanish with it.â",UCgmx2s3MLvgVYVowKGgoosA,1,UgzqC6iRs2aCBjgPOsJ4AaABAg,9Pqp_8XLC6c,2019-05-23 18:47:11

I think something that we as a species absolutely must come to terms with is the simple fact that the way we organize ourselves, and in particular how we organize our productivity, has huge implications not only for quality of life and economic stability, but for how we are able to manage our impact on the environment, and even what options are feasibly available to us in order to address the crisis. To put it quite simply, capitalism, as an economic and political system, is fundamentally incapable of addressing climate change in any proper or serious way, because it is incapable of putting any value before that of profit. Saving the world isn&#39;t profitable - it can&#39;t be. So we need to take a long hard look at our economy and make very deep and fundamental changes to the way we structure enterprises themselves, and how they derive funding. We need to be ready able and willing to switch to a fundamentally different means of organizing the economy.

The IPCC model results that I gave you compared with the real climate change proves that they are frauds. That has zero to do with the media. The media simply takes already exaggerated IPCC claims and exaggerates them even further. The 130 year old photo of the fort in Sydney harbor proves that there is no extreme sea level rise. 2.5 inches in 130 years. James Hansen's own failed climate predictions as reflected by his climate charts - not his interviews alone - prove that he is also a fraud. And your analysis of Antarctic ice is also moronic. You people have this theory that no matter what happens it proves that dangerous climate change is real. The fact is that all of Antarctica is below freezing temperature all the time. The ice expands from the edge of the continent as ice shelves over the water. These ice shelves are supported by the water as they expand. Eventually, as the weight and wave action take their effect they break off and fall apart. But the internal land based ice is not collapsing in any sense. And it will not collapse. The ice shelf formation and break up has been going on forever. And since those ice shelves are already floating in the water there is virtually no sea level change that results from their breaking off. If any significant amount of ice melting were occuring, then we would see much more sea level rise that we are actually seeing. The loss of 34 square miles of Luisiana swamp land is so small as to be laughable. It it were significant we could simply do the Netherlands trick and put up sea walls. Also, sea level has risen 350 feet since the last ice age. Massive amounts of the earth surface have gone under water as a result of that natural process. And much of the earth that is now dry land was once under water. Here is an example. In Treblinka Poland an archeological expedition went looking for the remains of the 900,000 people that are claimed to have been buried there as a result of the Holocaust. They didn't find any human remains, but they found a shark tooth from when that part of Poland was under the ocean. I don't have time for the rest of your delusional comment. The simple truth is that while there is a small amount of climate change, there is no climate emergency. The temperature response of climate to CO2 is logarithmic and so we will get even less rapid change as time goes on. And the only reason why a climate emergency is being hyped is so that people will be willing to give up their freedom, elect communists and greens, and submit themselves to the slavery of (communism).",UCgmx2s3MLvgVYVowKGgoosA,1,UgzerRMIDKco8jfO-u54AaABAg,9Pqp_8XLC6c,2019-05-23 18:47:11

Nobody cares what the media has to say except for you types. It's easy to take a media story and then blame science for it, so that's what you have to do because you can't demonstrate the consensus to be wrong. In your mind you think you are beating the experts by attacking the media but to the rest of us you only look like a political extremist. But you are still posting blatant lies and going on about hysteria and psychobabble when it's your kind that does it. Like this obvious lie. Antarctica reached it's maximum ever sea ice extent in 2015 How is this is a lie? It's simple for anyone who understands the science behind it. Sea ice is at a maximum because the ice sheet is collapsing into the ocean. In other words, pointing to this fact only demonstrates how dire the ice melt is. If the ice sheet was not falling apart, sea ice would not be so high. Get it? How about this: There are literally thousands of temperature record and some will be broken all of the time. No, this is another blatant lie. Records are extremes by their very nature and if you are breaking them on a yearly basis it's a clear indication that extremes are now the new normal. Another nail in your pseudo scientific coffin. No functional brain would come to the conclusion that once in thousand year weather events happening on a yearly basis is, as you say, ""normal."" The Midwest of the US broke a bunch of cold records this last year. Which was an arctic vortex, a particularly nasty one too given that the heated atmosphere now holds more water vapor no body in the scientific field was surprised by the amount of snowfall. It was expected and lines up perfectly with everything climate science has said. Nobody is being displaced huh? What about the people in South Louisiana? An average of 34 square miles of South Louisiana land, mostly marsh, has disappeared each year for the past five decades, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. What about the salt water intrusion Florida is dealing with every time a king tide happens? What about the people of Bangladesh? How about the five Solomon Islands that have already been submerged?

Yes, temperatures are still going up a little. But the effect of CO2 on climate is logarithmic - meaning that we will get less and less climate response to the increased CO2. No one is being displaced by climate. That is just BS that Marxists want to use to infer guilt and push immigration. Plants are not being stressed. Exactly the opposite. Plants were stressed by the low levels of pre industrial CO2. CO2 is plant fertilizer. Most of the hydrocarbon structure of plants comes from the CO2 they take from the air. Satellite photography has shown that the biomass of the earth has increased in the last 50 years. In fact, CO2 actually helps plants endure drought conditions better. Global agriculture is stronger than it has ever been. And in regard to the encroachment of sea water, the oceans have risen 350 feet since the last ice age. The tiny amount that it has risen in recent years is inconsequential. There are literally thousands of temperature record and some will be broken all of the time. The Midwest of the US broke a bunch of cold records this last year. Antarctica reached it's maximum ever sea ice extent in 2015. And last, the data does not support the claim that weather is getting more extreme. The cost of extreme weather events when they do happen is going up drastically. But that is a result of us building more and more structures on or near the beaches. So I'll leave you with these pictures of a fort in Sydney harbor - taken 130 years ago and again today.

You don't actually think scientists sit around a table and vote on a consensus do you? You also don't get to ask me for peer reviewed papers since I never made a truth claim here, you did. When you make a truth claim it is your job to cite your evidence when asked. I asked and all you gave me was a blog tied to a politically funded think tank and I'm sorry, but those are as far from credible sources as you can get. You might as well cite a Disney movie to prove that animals can talk. The truth of the matter is that climate models are surprisingly accurate but ALL of them project LESS warming than we are actually measuring. The exact opposite of what you claimed. This is caused by a number of factors, primarily because science is overly conservative by nature, and also because many factors cannot be modeled such as carbon released by wildfires. Also there are several models, each designed based on different assumptions like if we continue to produce the same amount carbon emissions, another for if we reduce emissions according to the Paris agreement, and another for an overall increase in emissions. If you'd bother to actually investigate the link you gave me you would have noticed a few problems with it. You might have missed the donate button, you might have missed that the comments are closed, and you might have missed the fact that it does not cite any sources for the data or anything of use whatsoever. How is a person supposed to fact check the claim being made when you have no idea where to look? If you have a peer reviewed paper by all means link it. Any scientific paper will have all of its sources clearly stated and linked. That's how science works. Otherwise its unverifiable horseshit and thus not scientific. May as well as just scribble with some crayons on construction paper and proclaim it debunks a mountain of evidence to the contrary. So how about you try again?

BPL is climate researcher (Barton Paul Levenson). https://hubpages.com/politics/Climate-Change-Predictions-How-Accurate-Are-They-Really A zero energy state would mean something with mass doesnât exist. All massive things must have energy to exist (mass is energy). Black holes destroy all the larger pieces of matter on the way to heat death and emit their energy as radiation eventually. Heat death probably means a few elementary particles still exist each separated by light-years but larger particles decay and most of the elementary particles get annihilated by the antimatter products arising from the decay of the larger particles. The end result is a cold radiation-filled universe that endlessly inflates, with the radiation slowly being absorbed by the vacuum. The vacuum is not nothing. This continues until some random conditions arise that set up a new big bang (maybe). A big rip scenario is just a very rapid version of heat death, bypassing the black hole destruction of larger pieces of matter, destroying it directly instead.",UCHYU7hNuILX5PdA-y5fHQzQ,1,UgwfFgJf3cA3mbmiKHx4AaABAg,9Pqp_8XLC6c,2019-05-23 18:47:11

The theory has many very precise measurable shorter term predictions. And they have all been successful, hence the near universal acceptance of the theory among qualified scientists. I will quote a list of a few predictions provided by BPL: Global Climate Models have successfully predicted: 1. That the globe would warm, and about how fast, and about how much. 2. That the troposphere would warm and the stratosphere would cool. 3. That nighttime temperatures would increase more than daytime temperatures. 4. That winter temperatures would increase more than summer temperatures. 5. Polar amplification (greater temperature increase as you move toward the poles). 6. That the Arctic would warm faster than the Antarctic. 7. The magnitude (0.3 K) and duration (two years) of the cooling from the Mt. Pinatubo eruption. 8. They made a retrodiction for Last Glacial Maximum sea surface temperatures which was inconsistent with the paleo evidence, and better paleo evidence showed the models were right. 9. They predicted a trend significantly different and differently signed from UAH satellite temperatures, and then a bug was found in the satellite data. 10. The amount of water vapor feedback due to ENSO. 11. The response of southern ocean winds to the ozone hole. 12. The expansion of the Hadley cells. 13. The poleward movement of storm tracks. 14. The rising of the tropopause and the effective radiating altitude. 15. The clear sky super greenhouse effect from increased water vapor in the tropics. 16. The near constancy of relative humidity on global average. 17. That coastal upwelling of ocean water would increase. Seventeen correct predictions? Looks like a pretty good track record to me. Exact timing of things happening in a dynamical system is difficult. Instead, the direction in which things are moving on average is monitored. The ""worse than expected"" predictions arise because scientists err on the side of least drama when making timing predictions that have an applicable range, at least when talking to news media who want just one fact, but they generally show the full timing range in their papers. The concept of a true ânothingâ exists but the reality doesnât exist. The concepts of unicorns and God exist, but thereâs no evidence of these in reality either. At least abiogenesis and inflation have some evidence and proposed natural mechanisms to make them possible, and even likely. Science does not say âan absolute nothing [exists] either before or eventually after entropy comes to completionâ. You have constructed a straw man argument here. âScience agrees that many things religious faith brings humanity are positiveâ. Iâd need to see a peer-reviewed paper documenting this. Most scientists are atheists out of repulsion by the overall bad effects of religion. Yes, belief systems independently evolved all over the planet. In fact, around 5000 religions have been invented by humans, most of them mutually exclusive with each other. Arguing this is evidence of a god is like arguing a defendant is innocent because one witness has him at home, another at a bar, another at a bowling alley, another at a movie theater, and another on vacation in a foreign land, all at the same time when the crime was committed. It is just evidence that many humans were and still are superstitious.",UCHYU7hNuILX5PdA-y5fHQzQ,1,UgwfFgJf3cA3mbmiKHx4AaABAg,9Pqp_8XLC6c,2019-05-23 18:47:11

In so far as any one person may try to falsify the theory, it is unfalsifiable. If anything, I see that its predictions are disproved all the time with constant statements and findings that create statements like ""worse than expected,"" ""much sooner than scientists thought,"" etc. I don't know if I believe there is a God or not, but I know that regardless of whether or not a true nothing exists, the concept of nothing exists even though it is unfalsifiable, as are all things immaterial. A hyperobject is something which we must trust exists without being able to prove it exists. Yes evolution is solid as is expansion, but they don't get us any closer to abiogenesis or a true nothing. I think it's astounding the similarity with the God question. Science agrees that many things religious faith brings humanity are positive and can't deny that belief systems independently evolved all over the planet throughout time. This may not be falsifiable evidence, but it is no different than evolution pointing to abiogenesis or expansion pointing to an absolute nothing either before or eventually after entropy comes to completion.",UCaOYckFewswmKce9FN6Bz-w,1,UgwfFgJf3cA3mbmiKHx4AaABAg,9Pqp_8XLC6c,2019-05-23 18:47:11

When the theory of God makes measurable predictions, we can discuss it further. As long as it allows anything, it is no different than a math-less String Theory. Anyone can disprove the theory of climate change (the human-causation of) since it makes many measurable predictions. If the predictions are wrong, the theory is falsified. So far the predictions of the theory of climate change fall within observational error bars. It has a long history of making correct predictions now along with many failed attempts to falsify it. It is virtually certain that it is a correct theory. And you are mixing up or combining a few separate scientific theories. Each scientific theory explains different things. Itâs like claiming the theory of the atom does not explain the theory of quantum fields in which atoms form. The theory of the atom isnât intended to explain something thatâs independent of an atom, just the atom alone. Abiogenesis explains life arising from non-life (evidence is incomplete but one of several natural explanations seems possible). Evolution explains speciation thereafter (evidence here is conclusive). Inflation explains a universe from a prior ânothingâ (strong evidence exists for the inflationary framework but itâs not conclusive in specific details). Standard ÎCDM Cosmology explains the expanding universe thereafter, that is, only starting immediately after the Big Bang (evidence here is conclusive).
