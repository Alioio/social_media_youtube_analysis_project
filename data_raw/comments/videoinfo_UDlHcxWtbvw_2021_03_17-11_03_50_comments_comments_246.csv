Have you ever been outside of your little bubble? Because there's a real world out here, and there's factual information that is readily available to all. Trump was forced to bank overseas because American banks stopped loaning him money that he never paid back. He doesn't even pay his contractors, he screws people out of their money and then makes false claims and uses the courts to bleed them until they can't afford to defend themselves anymore. He's a mobster. The bankers in the 90s called him the ""P.T. Barnum of the 21st Century"" - they told him the only thing he knew how to do was sell the Trump name, so told him to sell his name to co's to use on buildings. That's how they got some of their money back - but for decades, he's been getting money from Russia and the Saudis - and now Jared is doing the same thing. Even Dumb and Dumber Eric and Don Jr bragged about their dad getting all their money from Russia. You need to read more and get outside of your little box. You've got some hard news coming up soon re Trump and his money. Money laundering via the NRA and trafficking via his modeling agency and Mara-Lago. He met his whore wife through Epstein, she was an escort and a porn model ffs. Seriously, open your eyes! Ever watch the documentary about his golf course in Scotland how he screwed the Scots - they hate his ass. You Got Trumped is the name of it. WATCH it. Watch the Documentary on him and Hillary too, tells their backgrounds and how they became who they are. It's The Choice 2016 on Frontline, from PBS - Public Broadcasting - not affiliated with parties. Just straight up truth, you can even see photos of your mobster when he had Roy Cohn as his main lawyer, the gay mobster who taught Trump to never admit wrongs and just deny over and over and then sue until they can't afford to sue back anymore. Leftist have logic, which is more than you've got right now, el zippo - nada - just a bunch of worthless BS crap - it's pathetic. I feel sorry for you. You're in for a big surprise headed your way.

The only realistic place that this guy can move his farm to is the US that has more stable weather patterns and accessible irrigation if he can afford it. Climate change is the biggest cause of the immigration crisis, as peoples lives get less sustainable due to the weather and the month long droughts, they move north towards the stable/wetter grounds where farming/living is actually possible.
