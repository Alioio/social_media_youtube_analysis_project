The temperatures changes are going faster then it ever went in geologial history.

Some of the change they occur may help or weaken the living organism affected by the mutation. If it's an helping mutation, it will help them surviving while the rest opf the specie will die (because they are weaker then the mutated specie). So, species don't evolve that fast, they need that genetic change to help them, and this takes over hundreds/ thousands of years, or it could just not happen because all of the specie has died before it had time to adapt (evolve).
