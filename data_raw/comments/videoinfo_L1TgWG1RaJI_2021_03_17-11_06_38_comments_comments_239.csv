It is deeply spiritual. For, the root of the environmental crisis lies in human greed and selfishness. What is asked of us is not greater technological skill, but deeper repentance for our wrongful and wasteful ways. What is demanded is a sense of sacrifice, which comes with cost but also brings about fulfillment. Only through such self-denial, through our willingness sometimes to forgo and to say ‚Äúno‚Äù or ‚Äúenough‚Äù will we rediscover our true human place in the universe.&quot; Quote from His All-Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew the ‚ÄúGreen Patriarch‚Äù <br /><br /><br />These people are all coming to this issue decades late.

First of all, what has someones wealth or standing got to do with whether or not they should protest or have concerns about the future of the planet? None. They don't tell people to not have children, not to eat, breath or live - it would help if you were to be realistic? There are options regarding travel, but I suppose some sacrifices will have to be made for a while where global travel is concerned, but people will have to ask where their morals are at for that portion, and whether they're selfish enough to sacrifice their kid's futures in exchange for a holiday to Miami. I'm a documentary photographer and former Royal Marine Commando. I've covered everything from the war in Syria, Civil uprising against the government in Santiago, Chile, anti-poaching teams in Kenya and Zimbabwe, Israeli and Palestinian conflict over the west bank and gaza strip (from both sides of the coin) and numerous other projects, I've had awards from Olympus, The Nikon Foundation, The Royal Photographic Society, among others. I have picked up skills of intuition over the years, and the one thing I noticed about Extinction Rebellion was the diversity of people involved. When I covered them during the London, Berlin and New York protests (I had to get around the world a lot for that few weeks) including the build up to all of their protests (about 14 months prior to the big events themselves), there were warehouse workers, carers, scientists, former police officers, students, firemen, doctors, nurses, mechanics, kitchen stewards, three British soldiers who went AWOL to do this, there were taxi drivers who had quite because they were worried, entrepreneurs, web designers, factory workers, assemblers...there were all sorts of people, from all walks of life there. If you have kids, based on what I learnt from the environmental scientists (at Cambridge, Oxford, Warwick, Portsmouth, Southampton and York unis during my time working on this documentary photography project) then I would be seriously worried about what those children will have to look forward to, even in 15 - 20 years. I have kids, it certainly worried me.",UCE6_r3hEzHf38di2QyjoS8A,1,UgzRIoWuJ96CmTzx4ht4AaABAg,L1TgWG1RaJI,2020-03-10 19:00:03
