What's less debatable is they all contribute to more CO2 and that gets ignored. Team climate awareness always ignores that fact and instead tries to make everyone in developed countries feel false guilt for using an incandescent bulb or not recycling that plastic bag or driving their SUV instead of biking. If a majority just love it that there are an extra 9,000 people per hour, I'm ok with it, I just want them to stop deceiving us, talking as if CO2 is all our fault. When talking about extinctions, state the real reason, people are breeding like rabbits, spreading, hunting, eating, polluting, harming species. When talking about forests being destroyed, state the real reason, capitalists are burning them to make room for new farmlands to feed the growing population. Over 5000 square miles burned in Indonesia in less than two years, that wasn't climate change, that was a match lit by a capitalist to grow palm oil for sale. The lack of up-front honesty over climate change is astounding/insidious and pervasive like a pandemic virus of the mind and spirit, that's what bothers me. At least at one point, the Indonesian fires CO2 output was greater than the entire US economy, for example. . If a search is done on ""climate change"" in quotes and sorted by view count, the top video is Prince Ea addressing the future, apologizing that we destroyed our world, asking why, and holding up a $100 bill as the answer. Correct. It is emotionally gripping. But like everyone else, he avoids the truth. One cannot be truthful and avoid the fact that everyone contributes to CO2 and those new 6 million+ people per month are responsible for a lot more CO2 in the air. It is not honest to pretend the growing population is not far far outpacing the average person's attempt to be good. They are using terror against us while hiding a root cause. We could debate how much of a factor but I say it is deliberately left out of the discussion because those new consumers are so profitable, and that's dishonorable. Every business wants more customers, even Joe Average with a website wants more viewers, I can't blame him, same here. I agree, we could manage 11 billion by 2100 and the rich can get even more filthy rich, plus it even creates opportunity for everyone but just you watch, the upcoming increase in mass migrations from the breeding countries to the not-so-much-breeding wealthier countries will be a vast deception packaging them as ""climate refugees"", it's a deliberate contemptible lie, they are climax refugees, eh-hem. . Fine, let it all happen, even applaud it but let the public understand what's really going on instead of imposing false guilt on them. Your leader Saint Greta scolds the World Economic Forum, emissions must not just be lowered, they must totally stop, immediately: https://youtu.be/fIDxQlqAcBQ?t=215 . Without diesel fuel to move food from farms to stores, Greta, what do you plan to do with all the bodies from starvation and food riots? Edit: Actually, 35,000 square miles over the larger time frame. ""During the large fire events in 1997/98, 2015 and 2019 an estimated total of 9.2 million hectares of Indonesia's landmass was burned"". ""Indonesia is the world's largest producer of palm oil, surpassing Malaysia in 2006, producing more than 20.9 million tonnes, a number that has since risen to over 34.5 million tons (2016 output).

I assume Mr. Guterres and the United Nations are relying on the peer-reviewed scientic evidence from scientists in 195 member countries contained in the IPCC reports (International Panel on Climate Change). Earth history has had many climate changes, and resulting mass extinction events caused by global climate changing rapidly (within a few decades). I do know that UN Secretary General Guterres' ""we're on track for 3 degrees rise (by 2050)"", if based on the UN IPCC report, safe to assume, therefore actually does not take into account the feedback loop of methane release from thawing permafrost. The same amount of methane causes 80x the warming that co2 causes. This a huge omission, therefore, and it puzzles me why the IPCC doesn't include the methane feedback loop, and other feedback loops. Science detects and measures many self-reinforcing feedback loops that are causing more warming. Including all the feedback loops, the science shows that the actual worse case scenario is 6-8 degrees warming (by 2050-2100) ! This warming melts the arctic ice, among other things. The ice-free arctic in the next few years (!) is especially troubling because a warmer arctic causes a disruption and slowing of the jet stream, turning it into an air pattern that is more wavy and less straight. These wavy air currents bring arctic temperatures more south than usual, and allow tropical temperatures more north than usual. The result has been extreme record-breaking heat in Alaska and Siberia, for example, and arctic freezes as far south as the southern United States! These extreme temperatures disrupt the natural growing seasons and cycles, confusing blooming trees, for example, which bloom too early, and then therefore their fruits are wiped out by a late frost. Also entire orchards' trees are dying from new disease and pests in the warmer climate. The slowed jet stream air currents also cause storms to stay longer in a location, pouring more rain there, causing flooding. The slowed jet stream air currents also cause heat waves to stay longer in a location, baking the soil and causing drought. Climate change causes these extreme weather events (and pests, like locusts) to happen more often, and the result is that food crops are killed. The total global food harvest is smaller therefore, which is causing famine. This will get worse as climate change increases, resulting in increasing extremes in weather, and smaller and smaller food supply, and more and more famine worldwide. That's just logical, and it's changing too fast for the plants to evolve adaptations to the rapidly changing growing conditions. It's easy to see that in 10, 20 and 30 years our global food supply situation will therefore be dire indeed. We haven't been at 2 degrees C higher since 130,000 years ago. We haven't been at 4 degrees C higher since 5 million years ago (!) United Nations IPCC science says that we will have 3 degrees higher by 2050 (!)

I'll post my previous comment again in case you missed it, about the numbers. - There are 32,441 threatened species - that we know of - But we know that we don't know even a fraction of all species on Earth. Let me explain. Here is the problem; Current estimates for the number of species on Earth range between 5.3 million and 1 trillion. That’s a massive degree of uncertainty. It’s like getting a bank statement that says you have between $5.30 and $1 million in your account. Part of the problem is that we cannot simply count the number of life forms. Many live in inaccessible habitats (such as the deep sea), are too small to see, are hard to find, or live inside other living things. So, instead of counting, scientists try to estimate the total number of species by looking for patterns in biodiversity. Scientists have used a technique based on patterns in the number of species at each level of biological classification to arrive at a prediction of about 8.7 million species. But most estimates of global biodiversity overlook microorganisms such as bacteria because many of these organisms can only be identified to species level by sequencing their DNA. As a result the true diversity of microorganisms may have been underestimated. After compiling and analyzing a database of DNA sequences from 5 million microbe species from 35,000 sites around the world, researchers concluded that there are a staggering 1 trillion species on Earth. It’s not just the microorganisms that have been overlooked in estimates of global biodiversity. We’ve also ignored the many life forms that live inside other life forms. Most – and possibly all – insect species are the victim of at least one or more species of parasitic wasp. A more fundamental problem with counting species comes down to a somewhat philosophical issue: biologists do not agree on what the term “species” actually means. The well-known biological species concept states that two organisms belong to the same species if they can interbreed and produce fertile offspring. But since this concept relies on mating, it cannot be used to define species of asexual organisms such as many microorganisms as well as some reptiles, birds and fish. It also ignores the fact that many living things we consider separate species can and do interbreed. For example, dogs, coyotes and wolves readily interbreed, yet are usually considered to be separate species. Other popular species definitions rely on how similar individuals are to one another (if it looks like a duck, it is a duck), their shared evolutionary history, or their shared ecological requirements. Yet none of these definitions are entirely satisfactory, and none work for all life forms. There are at least 50 different definitions of a species to choose from. Whether or not a scientist chooses to designate a newly found life form as a new species or not can come down to their philosophical stance about the nature of a species. Our ignorance about the true biodiversity on our planet has real consequence. Each species is a potential treasure trove of solutions to problems including cures for disease, inspirations for new technologies, sources of new materials and providers of key ecosystem services. Yet we are living in an age of mass extinction with reports of catastrophic insect declines, wide-scale depopulation of our oceans and the loss of more than 50% of wildlife within the span of a single human life. Our current rate of biodiversity loss means we are almost certainly losing species faster than we are naming them. We are effectively burning a library without knowing the names or the contents of the books we are losing. So while our estimate of the number of species on the planet remains frustratingly imprecise, the one thing we do know is that we have probably named and described only a tiny percentage of living things. New species are turning up all the time, at a rate of roughly 18,000 species each year. For example, researchers in Los Angeles found 30 new species of scuttle fly living in urban parks, while researchers also in the US discovered more than 1,400 new species of bacteria living in the belly buttons of university students. Even if we take the more conservative estimate of 8.7 million species of life on Earth, then we have only described and named about 25% of life forms on the planet. If the 1 trillion figure is correct, then we have done an abysmally poor job, with 99.99% of species still awaiting description. It’s clear our planet is absolutely teeming with life, even if we cannot yet put a number to the multitudes.

I would only add that if the sea levels rise and we see millions upon millions of people because of that and becoming refugees, at that point we of course must call them climate refugees. Or if an arable land becomes uninhabitable (for example due to desertification caused by global warming or the disruption of the water cycle. We must be careful with our projections when it comes to the effects of climate change, not be too alarmed or too relaxed. There is a lot we don't yet fully understand about our climate, it is a gigantic system with incredible amounts of variants and feedback loops. If, say, in 50 years we see the Golf Stream disrupted and a drastic change in weather across Europe and elsewhere, there can be unforeseen consequences that we can't predict with our current understanding. And about the population increase we see right now ? I wouldn't worry about that. It will sort itself out eventually naturally, no matter what incentives or schemes we may put in place. In fact we will have the opposite problem in a few generations. An older, declining population. Most developed countries are already seeing the beginning of this and it is only going to hasten, while the developing nations will eventually follow suit, after some time eventually every nation will have less and less people who are older and older. An inverted pyramid. Forced or incentivised sterilizations will not be necessary, nor politically feasible. The fact is with a more educated population and especially with an educated and emancipated female population you will see less children per woman.

So now the message is, nobody can know, so therefore it's ok for us to terrify the children by just tossing out a number of 73,000 extinct per year because no one can prove it false cuz it displays our concern for the environment? I'm all for caring for the ecosystem but can't it be combined with a concern for truth in science? I have not been able to find a single extinction formula along with data used as inputs. That's not science. In science, we publish and allow others to verify. What we're seeing is a belief system hiding in darkness while pious, it is fake science. On top of that, the known extinctions are due to the crush of humanity, hunting, pollution etc, from the 150 new consumers on earth every minute who all have this pesky quality of liking to eat, but that's all kept hush-hush because it is big profit for boardroom capitalists who care only about one thing, money. There are no species extinct from the .88 ppm per year rise in CO2 or +0.0071 C per year averages since 1880, those are from NASA figures. Forests are destroyed for new farmlands. Indonesia tops the chart, burning over 5,300 square miles in less than two years to grow palm oil for sale. That was not climate change, it was a match lit by a capitalist. We seriously need to cut the platitudes, wake up and get honest, drop the deceptions. Big business thinks it will be able to manage the 150 new consumers per minute for big profits by moving them to developed countries packaged as ""climate refugees"" instead of the proper term, coitus refugees.
