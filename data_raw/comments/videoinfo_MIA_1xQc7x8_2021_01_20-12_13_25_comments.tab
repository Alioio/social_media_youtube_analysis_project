Rich people feel guilty for their life-style so EVERYBODY has to pay. The irony is that we think we can solve this with pumping money into this. Where is it going to end up? Meanwhile money is still an abstract thing and doesn&#39;t bring us any closer to nature. It&#39;s still personal choices of people whether they fly 10 times per year or don&#39;t want any green plant or tree in their garden. Can&#39;t force global population to pay for that. They say it&#39;s for investments in Bangladesh etc, but they have problems with water management, and lack of leadership in this, not just with climate. If you really believe that our actions increase temperature, we should live more simple, substract things, not add things. No money is needed for that. And why spend billions if of a lot of people don&#39;t even have their basic needs met? Which more has to do with power, powerlessness, oppurtunities, right investments at the right places etc. There should be investments made in projects that help women in third world countries out of their powerlessness, so they will give birth to the amount of children which their community can actually support, etc. The power of money only works if it&#39;s spend with a purpose and with integrity. Not just blindly pumping it around.	UC0RA84Qz1nm_idmYuSwBDDw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0RA84Qz1nm_idmYuSwBDDw	0

We can help the environment by starting in our own communities, our homes, work places and schools. If you want a better world, start first with making yourself and your home better. Then work on making your own neighborhood and community better. If everyone did this, it would make a real difference. <br />üôè‚ù§Ô∏è‚úåÔ∏èüá∫üá≤üåéüåèüåç<br /><a href="https://youtu.be/Bkar4jn3JWw">https://youtu.be/Bkar4jn3JWw</a>	UCfTln1lkPrT1IIUrfrG_AZw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfTln1lkPrT1IIUrfrG_AZw	0

People talk about climate change because they don&#39;t want to face the fact that what will destroy the world is WW III. The same countries that fight climate change make millions developing and selling weapons. They complain about airplanes but they use airplanes to go to the conferences to complain about airplanes. End poverty and diseases first. Climate change is something for rich Europeans who destroyed many places in the world and now want to &quot; save the planet&quot;. Stupidity and love for money is what will destroy the planet, not climate change.	UCeV7bUZv5xC0Z-EUQGPjrCg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeV7bUZv5xC0Z-EUQGPjrCg	0

Also they keep saying &quot;to care for the most vulnerable&quot; when they &quot;leaders&quot; have always done everything to enrich and benefit themselves more at the expenses of the most vulnerable. The planet is hearting mostly because of the extreme devastating mining, polluting oil extraction, tree clear cutting, etc, and specially unnecessary human exploitation, which is all decided by the very worst of humanity and the planet whom are at the top of the decision making.

Let&#39;s start with &quot;195 governments agreed....&quot;. That alone should give you pause. Then let&#39;s consider CO2 is PUMPED into greenhouse by professional growers. On purpose! Thus, it will enhance the greening of the earth. (Don&#39;t these folks want a &quot;green new deal&quot;?) But climate change alarmists call it &quot;pollution&quot;. Complete and utter disconnect from reality, if they can&#39;t admit an obvious positive. They call it &quot;global warming&quot; for about 20 years, then change the name to a term that describes what has occurred naturally since the beginning of earth and before man existed &quot;climate change&quot;, even though &quot;warming&quot; is entirely their meaning. Why do that? Really, why? One word... Propaganda.	UCcUunmk2OxYz-QKw1Z8aAWQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcUunmk2OxYz-QKw1Z8aAWQ	0

Though China and India are the bigger AGW problem, they are perceived less and less as such because they aren‚Äôt blatantly rejecting the Paris Climate Agreement (the U.S. withdrawal becomes final on November 4, 2020 / the day after the election ‚Äî thus, making AGW a prime issue, which the Democrats will squander the political capital of by overplaying garish social issues).

It would provide freshwater, fish farming, it will be the world&#39;s personal radiator by sending freezing water to our polar Caps, help with transportation, energy and power, flooding, cleaning up the ocean, and much more. This may sound a bit crazy but if supposedly something came and hit earth causing the world to heat up and started to melt whatever ice there was causing world floods then we this time are that thing (The Human astroid) that will heat up this world causing our own death by water cause earth doesn&#39;t care if it has land, water, lava, no air, acid rain, or if it just blows up and becomes the next ring of astroids between Mars and the sun.

And more importantly what about those Leaders who are dictated by GREED that don&#39;t attend?<br />Why dont they attend? Do they know why they don&#39;t? when the days news headlines with deaths, or some terrorists act, which media companies are allowing negative news that suports violence or terrorism to take precedence? <br /><br /><br /><br />Think about.. Who will lose the most if Climate changes are addressed thus steering the world to even more profitable greener energy driven economy. <br /><br />Where do you think terrorists get their funds from? You really don&#39;t have to look very far as to what the main industry is involved, and guess what? And who or what Nations do you think are heavily invested in those corporations funding Terrorists?<br /><br /><br /><br />Let&#39;s forever remember all those who attend climate change conferences as hero&#39;s, but more importantly lets forever remember those TRAITORS!! and terrorists supporters who didnt, Shun them and all their families, don&#39;t allow the world to be Trumped..

She is saying that the environmental diplomacy has taken huge steps in the last years. Before Paris, as she said, even if some governments sat together to try to understand how can they work together on fighting climate-related issues, the most &quot;dangerous&quot; ones didn&#39;t even care about participating on those talks as they were too worried on continuing their economic growth which is obviously connected to the environmental issues (countries like the BRIC). Although for some it&#39;s &quot;just politics&quot;, please try to understand that first of all, having almost all the governments sitting, trying to find a solution, or before that, the reason for the climate change based on scientific facts it&#39;s a big step, so please be sensible.

What do you EXPECT them to say?<br />Wheel cart and a donkey to peddle his organic bananas?<br />Shame Trump stopped Paris 2015 and global warming. But CO2 is still going up and up, so there is hope we can get a bit warmer, since CO2 works some strange ways: Makes warm weather hotter, but cold weather gets colder.

Humanity needs to see the world as it is and it is dying. Decreasing (or even stopping) GHGE&#39;s won&#39;t prevent catastrophic, runaway Arctic warming. Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) is the crucial first step to stop this train wreck. The last time humanity had an intelligent breakthrough in CDR was over 1,000 years ago with terra preta. Current CDR tools would utterly fail against the ravages of an ice-free Arctic Ocean. If half of the world&#39;s super-computers were focused on CDR, it may deliver an innovative, original breakthrough to keep complex life on this planet alive.

Individually make a major contribution to combatting global warming. Go Green Between 13C/55F and 30C/85F - don&#39;t heat if your interior space is warmer than 13C/55F, and don&#39;t cool if your interior space is cooler than 30C/85F. It&#39;s easy. Go about your life as normal, just dress warmer, dress cooler, or dress in layers as conditions warrant. It&#39;s what much of the world has been doing all along.

All those countries who are in the Paris Climate Accord did not want to be members because they would have to pay the carbon tax in the form of carbon credits. So PCA decided to have the US join and give over $10 billion to the PCA which will be used to pay off those countries who didn&#39;t want to be members. They will distribute that money to the corrupted government and pay them to become PCA members. This includes China and India who are the biggest polluters. In fact, China and India were allowed to increase their carbon output. At the moment, Carbon credits are being traded as commodities. Countries can buy carbon credits and will do not do anything to improve the environment. By 2030, PCA and IPCC (International Panel of Climate Change) are able to cash in their carbon credit which represents trillions of dollars. People who will benefit from this are the commodities brokers, corporations, George Soros, The Clintons, The Bush&#39;s, and Al Gore.

Every major nation was ready to sign a binding agreement on their country&#39;s commitment to carbon reduction over a clearly stated time. the united states threw a tantrum and blew the whole thing off claiming that a promise ought to be sufficient. But then we would only promise something that essentially added up to nothing, and at that point the ehole thing virtually disintegrated due to the disunity sown by our country. wonder why?<br />does the word PETRO DOLLAR mean anything to anyone who actually benefits from it? from there echoes an old idea we Americans used to see as having real significance in the business/political landscape, and that idea was commonly referred to as &quot;conflict of interests.&quot; our government is two-faced. it claims to want to lead the world on climate action, yet in reality blocks any movement in that direction, both at home and abroad because our entire economic well being depends on the petro industry expanding until there is no more oil, and then, as obama says, the united states will move into a carbon reduced future. thats what he really means.

The end goal of &quot;1.5C&quot; and &quot;2C&quot; is fraudulently based on models that vastly overstate the warming. So much so that we could do nothing on climate for the next 50 years and we still would only warm by another .5C. How can I be confident with such a prediction? Because that is what has happened for the last 70 years already. About 0.1C of warming per decade. And the warming has actually slowed down in the last 20 years, on par with the science that says CO2&#39;s impact is based on the log of the concentration of CO2.

Scientists may strive to achieve the impossible, but none of their ideas, good or half baked ever make it to the finish line within considerable time and effort put in by the engineers who strive to take it from concept to field-proven reality. <br /><br />A prime example was the US development of the first atomic bomb...... The US military listened to the scientists who said, we must first meet with the engineers to ascertain the feasibility of these options. The engineer&#39;s foresight enabled them to advise which of the options were utterly impossible and which might possibly work out. The decision was made to accept the engineer&#39;s advice and the projects succeeded.....<br /><br />Such was not the case in Germany nor in Japan...... the government refused to listen to the engineers. We need to make political stupidity a criminal offense and prosecute these fool with the death penalty for all the suffering and death that will otherwise occur to the masses.

Yes, they have signed, but it&#39;s nowhere near enough. It&#39;s much less than what is needed. In Canada alone, even with the new Left-wing government, it&#39;s less than what what signed before. Look up the facts from NASA, ESA, the Chinese space agency, and many other agencies around the world that have the ability to look at the planet from a global scale. They all say that it is too late to stop the train that is climate change. If you look at Australia for example. They have shutdown the monitoring stations, stating that the money is better spent somewhere else! Australia is the number one government that monitors the south pole. They have elected a right-wing government that says F it! People are going for have to move, and therefore we should just make the best well we are here!Why give up I ask you? Why? Do you not want to have children? Do you want them fighting over fresh water, and land? Some people say let&#39;s try and find another planet. Let&#39;s try and move into the stars. Why? Why, when this is the best place we have, and we can try and save it. Yes there&#39;s going to be a global mass extinction. Yes we won&#39;t be able to feed humanity, or the majority of life here, but we can bring it back after many have died. It&#39;s time for mass global civil Disobedience! It&#39;s time to take back our planet from the billionaire businessman that are killing us all. Communism is horrible, and so is extreme capitalism! We must, we need to bring balance between the left and the right! Too much of the scale pushing either way is detrimental the planet! We must find the balance! We must fight for a balanced society! One where we don&#39;t throw everything away, and one where we throw things away to find a better way! We must be progressive, yet be sustainable for our own families! Only you can do it! Only you can get up and teach yourself, and your children that we must not waste, and we must throw away the things that are bad for our planet. Contact the local government, and tell them that you are a swing voter, and you will only vote for them if they care about sustainable development, and sustainable business! We must fight, and the time is now, or the future is war for resources. We all know this. Droughts all over Australia, the middle east, Europe, Asia, and the Americas. Please for me, for my children, for you, and your family! The time is now. Join <a href="http://350.org">350.org</a>, or the keep it in the ground campaign, or the many others! The time is now! Just making one phone call to your local government will make a major difference!	UCQmjocxx5n1KTICsCr0C7mQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQmjocxx5n1KTICsCr0C7mQ	0

There is a huge lesson for the human race here and it is becoming more apparent daily.There is no way to quick fix a flawed system - our skewed system of constant growth or so called progress..there is no such thing.All we have done as a species is create technologies that have alienated us from the bedrock of our environmental source and that have put us on a disastrous path to our own destruction and extinction.The global and &#39;concerned&#39; governments(note that none of them are mentioned by her)are simply giving lip service in order to continue doing what they have always done..make more profits for their shareholders and benefactors(the invisible 1% that hold more than 50% of the global economic wealth)and at the same time line their own pockets through those corrupt connections.

Job done, pat yourself on the back. <br /><br />The Paris agreement is a sick joke. A goal of limiting warming to 1.5 C, now already passed even before the agreement is ratified. A firm commitment to 2.0 C, but with measures that will deliver 4-12 C. <br /><br />With global dimming taken into account we&#39;re <b>already</b> over 3 C above pre-industrial. <br /><br />Meanwhile even these so called &#39;legally binding&#39; agreements are being completely ignored. Australia has just granted licences for vast new coal mines. Canada is still subsidising oil sand extraction even though it&#39;s well below profitable in terms of money and nearly below profitable in terms of energy.

Bland, wishy-washy talks which are largely devoid of any interesting and/or challenging information. Packed full of clich√©s (&quot;we must do this together&quot;, &quot;real progress requires change&quot;, &quot;we have to think outside the box&quot; etc etc), but not really giving us any real information.<br /><br />I miss the old TED talks which used to be much more data based, with facts, figures, demonstrations etc. Occasionally I still see them, but too much people talking for a long time about not much.

So how can you say you want to change the global warming path we&#39;ve been taking, when your carbon footprint is off the charts? <br />She mentiones new technologies regarding clean energy, but what about this not so new technology called conference calling? I know its not as fancy as all getting together in beautiful Paris to discuss the problem, to later go on cocktails to drink champagne and pat each other on the back for having signed an agreement, but global warming is not fancy. A more humble approach is probably the way to go.	UCCFvCx0t556ya8yOeKPx6Xg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCFvCx0t556ya8yOeKPx6Xg	0

Governments have only got debt. Trillions of $ rising debt.	UCCVx1-lQS0Xb9AwNZ_1THyg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCVx1-lQS0Xb9AwNZ_1THyg	1	Ugg4sjg01HpQB3gCoAEC	saltnlightful

Ughm32YQShleRngCoAEC	0	2	2016-05-12 00:12:35	Pitch Madness	This was a great speech! I have been following the Climate talks for a while and it&#39;s nice to get an insider&#39;s perspective (with an informed opinion) on the matter. Seeing some huge steps forward from many countries around the world, like Peru giving solar power to 2 million of it&#39;s poorest citizens! The quality of life for many people is going to drastically improve. <br /><br />Honestly though the people who have the audacity to shrug off climate change, or unbelievably regurgitate half-baked negative rhetoric and slander without making even a bare minimal effort to look into climate change and forming their <i>own</i> opinions, while literally millions are starving, dying from extreme natural disasters, and pollution and then use this as an excuse to dismiss/not worrying about climate change is the <i>epitome</i> of hypocritical. <br /><br />REGARDLESS of whether you believe in climate change, renewable resources and lifestyles give people self-sufficiency and a degree of independence and security from the government and these corporations. Particularly in Australia for many living in remote communities we NEED renewable resources, not only so people can more easily access food, power and water, but so they don&#39;t choke under the extreme costs for access to these basic needs (which, hey, are only going to increase when these resources become more scarce). Renewable resources REDUCE the cost and IMPROVE living while giving people their own platform to stand on and have an actual say about their future.

Perhaps a future little ice age like the 1600&#39;s is seen as beneficial? Our climate has large swings of natural variability and I find it laughable to suggest we can manipulate it up and down via a few percentage points of atmospheric CO2 considering we are nowhere near on track for the catastrophic warming predicted 20 years ago and that data shows the climate is much less sensitive than claimed.

I also made an argument: if every year, we are putting twice as much CO2 into atmosphere as can be absorbed, then one would expect there to be consequences. An argument against man-made climate change doesn't just have to give an alternative theory as to why the earth is heating up. It also must give a theory for why pumping 10 billion tonnes of carbon into the air every year has no effect, because we've known since the 19th century that CO2 traps heat in the atmosphere.Ôªø	UCvsHrgT0vHx2NZk2Ifiqfhw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvsHrgT0vHx2NZk2Ifiqfhw	1	UggOhsUBc6UjKHgCoAEC	TheSlimeyLimey

In 2005, ELEVEN national academies made a joint declaration that not only is global warming happening, but that we need to do something about it. We produce TWICE as much CO2 as can be absorbed by the world's oceans and forests EVERY YEAR. Are you naive enough to think that this won't have any negative consequences?

It's pretty gross. And it's only one part of a much greater picture.	UC3xusfwPmRq7bkI5XPeGKLQ	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3xusfwPmRq7bkI5XPeGKLQ	1	UghIDEdLxATEGngCoAEC	tonbonthemon

And for all the skeptics, it's great to be critical to fix flaws in this agreement, but just assume for a minute that you could be wrong, just assume that the ice caps melting raising sea levels, weather patterns changing, green energy a possible solution (and unless you're psychic you can't assume that neither side is right/wrong), but just imagine that the vast majority of the scientific community is actually right on this, but we go down you're road and do nothing. What is the price to pay then?	UCicDuHv7Ijt2b7oHaHuCKZg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCicDuHv7Ijt2b7oHaHuCKZg	1	UghIDEdLxATEGngCoAEC	tonbonthemon

The fact that they got China, Russia, India and the US to sign is actually pretty historic.¬†¬† Now, as for what it does, or better yet, what it forces everyone to do, is nothing.¬† That's right, there are no penalties for not abiding by this treaty.¬† To make it even less stellar is that it lets every country decide on their own what they plan to do to "do their part" of the treaty.¬† Now, china and india said they would close coal mines and other mineral mines that are toxic for the environment but both of them said they wouldn't do it for something like 10-15 years (your going to have to look it up, I don't remember the exact dates)¬† They funny part is that the treaty ends in 2030 and I believe one of these countries "Plan" doesn't start until after 2030...it was basically their way to participate in the treaty, get all the good karma without actually doing anything for the climate.¬† On the flip side, don't worry about the 100 Trillion dollar number they keep throwing around, that is future money that could have been made between now and 2030 if we didn't do what the treaty wants us to do (Again, each country decides what they will do, they aren't forced to do anything).¬† The¬†Paris accords were important in atleast getting all those countries to sign a paper, but in reality,¬†very little is actually done and most of it is for¬†show.¬† I don't agree¬†that the US¬†pulled out but really, us being in or out has no¬†impact on the climate cause we didn't actually have a plan , as part of the treaty, to¬†reach the US lofty goal of 23% reduction in carbon emissions.....which will already happen due to getting off oil and moving to solar , wind and battery.

The main objective is to generate clout for the politicians, such as the speaker in this video. It is about appearing to be doing great things, by spellbinding people with stories that make them feel things. If they are lucky, they get a lot of money and/or power (same thing) for talking more, in the future. Hillary Clinton and Obama are good examples of coat turning career politicians as well, for example. Trump is the more honest fascist, like Mr Hitler himself, basing his politics on agressive bullshit, which feeds the rage of the masses, as a simple shortcut to power.

But being positive with a weak basis is also fraught with difficulty as well ‚Äî imagine how bad it would feel to find out it's all a lie. Don't get me wrong ‚Äî I'm not saying it's all a lie. We really did come to an agreement in Copenhagen. I know there are certain things being done to improve the climate, but every time she said lots and lots of great things were being done, I was disappointed (as a rather uninformed individual) to hear her not give specific examples to back up her incredibly positive claims.

There are many secondary problems that come from having an exploding population, one which submits to a central authority that cannot cope with the increased bureaucratic demands. However, the population increase is not the problem itself, it is actually a good sign. Chlorophyll production measured by satellites is actually increasing due to CO2. However, plant life and trees are dying in certain locales due to acidic rain caused by an output of SO2 and many other toxic wastes output by industry. Waters are polluted by chemical run-off and this affects our food chain directly. This is what needs to be addressed, not the increase in CO2. This is yet another fallacy that people buy into when thinking that the planet is dying - they focus on the CO2 and forget about the rest of the problems, hoping that somehow industry will be shut down by Carbon taxation and all the rest of the problems will cease. It doesn't happen like that. We need energy and resources to maintain our population, so attacking CO2 output will not solve any of the toxic waste issues we have.

It has absolutely nothing to do with saving the planet (or even saving the human race). The human race is doing damn well on this planet due to burning fossil fuels and I'm thankful to be alive because of it.

Who's teaching you this stuff? Do you seriously think that anyone was waiting for the tobacco industry to tell them cigarettes were harmful? The medical community knew that in the 19th century. Why do you think they were called "coffin nails" during WW1? Why did Mark Twain write about the hazards of smoking? "Lead Paint industry lobby"? The toxicity of lead paint was know 1000 years ago. Was the supposed _lead paint industry lobby_ a medieval trade guild? So that's why you think Big Oil propaganda is the cause of "denial." No, data is the cause. And BTW, no one denies climate change. Only a minority of climate scientists are convinced it is primarily man made. Follow the data and it takes you to skepticism. Follow the money and it takes you to the green NGOs who take in billions (look it up) a year with their propaganda.

I didn't believe that human's are responsible for changing the climate so dramatically either, but then I saw it for myself. Nobody needs to tell you what to believe, you need to find out what to believe. And I put my money on the people that told us that Lead in paint products is bad, despite what the Lead Paint industry lobby said, or the scientists and doctors that bravely confronted the Big Tobacco lobby, and their lies that smoking is supposedly actually good for you. Its nothing new, it has happened for as long as government influence and direction became as tradeable as a stock option. I don't buy this whole propaganda bullshit, my people bought into it 83 years ago, and it ended up in the deaths of millions. So the first thing I do is to do some research on the data and the people that proclaim said data, and what their motives are, what their research methods where, and who is paying them and possibly influencing their message. You cannot argue with the truth, you can deny it, you can smear it, you can do whatever it is you think will plug up the hole, but sooner or later it will prevail. Fewer and fewer people believe the lies and misinformation the Big Coal and Big Oil lobby funds people to say. So George, maybe you will call me names. Maybe you will continue with the petty comparisons I started out with because I simply thought the debate has got to be over by now. But I really sincerely hope not. I would rather have people who are still in denial step aside and let us save the planet, but honestly we can't do it unless everyone is on board with us. http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/4/048002	UCsk0hZHSD09SjHLa5rTu0Vg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsk0hZHSD09SjHLa5rTu0Vg	1	UghePyhUPoM6NngCoAEC	Lord Fluffykinz

On the other hand - Agree to tax or be taxed/fined more. Moreover, there&#39;s the political liability of not getting onboard. Participation does not correlate to universal interpretation of a theory&#39;s data. This issue at the international level will represent a precedent for global taxing authority. It represents one of the final steps for supporters of globalism to place one universal will over sovereign nations. Good speaker. I&#39;d love to see other hypothesis posited for the current global climate/weather/earth changes. It seems like that is now happening due to weakness in the global warming hypothesis and discovery of purposeful aligning of data with political global initiatives for profit and power. Alas, any other theories will be too late. Our taxes will be raised based on the idea of our carbon output and given to the UN. Interesting time to be alive.

In regards to global warming existing or not all those points are easily debunked. In regards to how the climate functions. All those topics are being heavily debated in scientific literature. Simply put the laymen dosent have the expertise to put add to the conversation. Note: water vapor is a feedback loop not a driver as its usually at saturation point and needs something else to warm the globe before it can perform any warming itself.

I am saying a proper debate on facts and figures should happen. None of such has occured ever since Algore became VP. You say the topics i bring up are easily debunked? The Medieval Warm periods itself is a heavily debated topic and you want to use that against me. There are scientist that say it is a global phenomenal. Every climatologist and Atmospheric Scientist knows that Water Vapour feedbacks are the main causes of increases in temperatures. Even the Scientific supporters of Man-Made Global Warming will tell you that. You clearly have not done your research. That water vapor feedback is the main part of the issue and where maybe, a debate should occur. Supporters say the feedback is 3 times. when skeptics say it is maybe less than 1 time as shown in the past few decades. As if it was 3 times, the ice caps at the poles would have melted and the temperature patterns wouldnt have been so normal. That is why even the IPCC cant predict future Climate patterns when they pretend they can as shown in the early 2000s predictions. Why we dont have to rush things is simply because we do have time. Imposing a rushed Carbon Tax program into place would displace millions of people from their jobs and you can guess where that will go. Obama's Carbon Tax program is as such. look it up.

Ugizkl5tZdADjHgCoAEC.8DjzB0hulql8Dk6WDQGl9-		2	2016-05-11 17:17:59	Skinnymarks	+Daryl Lim the reason why people who argue agents man made climate change are ridiculed is because they always bring up the same easily debunked topics over and over. We already know for a fact that the global warming deniers usually cite information comming out of the same think tanks that asserted that smoking didn't cause cancer and was actually good for your health and also asserted that lead posioning doesn't cause developmental brain damage to children. both cases producing research articles to mislead the public. For the medieval warm period, pro tip: Europe is not the same thing as the planet as a whole. Durring that time China was a frozen waste land. The current global warming is caused by the co2 in the air. exactly how the climate gets fucked up from global warming is the question we are debating.

Look at research papers and not media post. Those are biased. The people talking about man-made climate change aren't climatologist, they are public figures and media spokemen. I have many peers who are atmospheric Researchers and climatologist that don't agree with this notion that humans are the main cause of climate change. You can start by researching on Water vapour feedbacks, medieval warm periods, climate temperature patterns over the last century, IPCC climate predictions of 2002. I am not saying who is correct or who is wrong. What I am upset about is that anyone who questions man-made climate change is immediately ridiculed. Science and the pursuit for the truth is to Question. The best way to force the masses to not question is to make it seem that questioning itself is lame and stupid. That itself is anti-science. If you see anyone doing it, you know they are trying to influence you.	UCzGYzsuFExWykDun90eLM2A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzGYzsuFExWykDun90eLM2A	1	Ugizkl5tZdADjHgCoAEC	Daryl
