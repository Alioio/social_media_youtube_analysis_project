Regularity is long gone. This is on IMD record. To say that India is facing floods due to heavy rains is false. Reasons for floods in North Indian rivers&#39; basins stretching from Punjab to Assam is on account of frenzied melting of Himalayan glaciers prompted by climate change. One reputed German climatologist says the flooding of Indian plains will increase until 2030. After that glacial water run-off will keep getting reduced every year, as many glaciers would have melted by then. Afterwards, the whole Gangetic plain will slowly turn to desert like river Nizer basin has done.<br />Another reason for flooding of northern Indian plains is that it has turned into a gigantic concrete jungle where even 2 to 3 hours of rain floods a city like Delhi in no time. Because water has a little or no escape.",UCRMoRbLboKamYJdz_sQ0ZsQ,0,UgzKoDNVIjILDXWBk4p4AaABAg,wyrpV5msbZk,2020-09-30 12:00:14
