There was a significant drop but, only after a gradual increase with a peak in 2007 or so. Not to mention, there doesn't seem to be any other significant drop that has placed us back at the low of 91. What do you mean by ""past years,"" exactly? Thank you for your input, btw. I appreciate people that voice their opinions without insults. Do you believe we're keeping our emissions within this range and is such a range safe? Do we have to drop lower to keep our environment good? One thing that is definitely suggested by this is that the U.S. certainly has not increased in emissions over these years and has not played a major role in the contribution to the rising CO2 output. Check this graph: Link: https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-data The U.S. has been wiggling but the emissions steeply increased not as a direct result of the U.S. Still, U.S. isn't entirely off the hook because the European Union still contributes 6% less than the U.S. does. The biggest question though, should we help out China and the other nations to decrease their emissions? I understand what you're saying, John. U.S. gotta look out for the U.S. but if we join the Agreement, there's a political statement being made that the U.S. hopes for a ""greener"" world (I don't want hotter summers). Plus, does the U.S. contribute to it indirectly? A lot of goods are outsourced from China and they make their way into the U.S. for sale. Does the U.S. bear some responsibility for the demand of such goods in that aspect?",UCXkR9naQnrkubp-DvApfUvg,1,UggolOvuHFSQxngCoAEC,bvutiLuch_E,2017-05-31 20:59:40

US already decreases the CO2 emission for the past years while China isn't. China is one of the most polluted country. My point is, no developing country will follow that even they sign since it is not binding or don't have any system to enforce it.

Are these three things the only you ever think of? How about the three things that drives the human world into evil, Greed, Money and Power? Many sons and daughters want to get rid their of their parents to achieve liberty in different kind of reasons or to have a wealthy life upon receiving inheritance. Many parents abort their unborn babies or many people leave their elders into home for the aged because they are totally inconvenient. Many people wants justice or vengeance. Many people wants to pursuit happiness sacrificing others' liberty, life and happiness. Does peace and love gave the end for world war 2 and other wars? People don't need to ""feel"" hate to get rid of others in pursuit of the three things you mentioned. Does killings of hundreds of millions of religious people by Atheist regimes like Stalin, Mao and Pol pot good? Because they believe religion is the opium for the common people that caused misery and getting rid of religious people will stop it. Does killings of heretics by the Roman Catholic Church good? because they believe that only people who is one with their believe living together in this world will make the world more peaceful. Does killings of Islamic Terrorists good? because of the same reason of the former powerful church. I can go on and on to give examples of many people around the world whose moral good anchors differently from the others. We can never achieve the product of your wishful thinking because your wishes aren't the wishes of others. This world is totally unfair and full of injustice. Hating others is not the cause of chaos. As I said, many people don't need to feel hate to get rid of even some random inconvenient guy in pursuit of happiness. If the border wall is a symbol of hate for you, well, it's a peaceful solution for the others. My advice for you is to stop thinking wishfully of something impossible for all mankind.
