Reports from fishermen, seal hunters and explorers all point to a radical change in climate conditions and hitherto unheard-of temperatures in the Arctic zone. Exploration expeditions report that scarcely any ice has been met as far north as 81 degrees 29 minutes. Soundings to a depth of 3,100 meters showed the Gulf Stream still very warm. Great masses of ice have been replaced by moraines of earth and stones, the report continued, while at many points well known glaciers have entirely disappeared. Very few seals and no white fish are found in the eastern Arctic, while vast shoals of herring and smelts which have never before ventured so far north, are being encountered in the old seal fishing grounds. *Within a few years it is predicted that due to the ice melt the sea will rise and make most coast cities uninhabitable.*",UCwhWLkxIqKaBXShFaUJ0F9g,1,UgxanFHQ76RoTXTl2mt4AaABAg,lu-VzZ45MwI,2019-02-25 15:17:31

Initially, the two senstors were either appointed by the Governor of the State or the State Legislature and not elected by the populace. The House of Representatives was created to represent the interests of the populace or the people and have always been directly elected by the people. The needs, desires and interests of the people can often be at odds with those of the state and some of the delegates were afraid the larger, more populous states would dominate the less populous states. Business interests within a state will always take priority with the Senstors over those of the general populace when they are at odds with one another. To compromise, and ensure neither the state nor rhe populace was subject to the tyranny of the other, all bills must be passed by both chambers.<br /><br />Now that the populace votes for the senator along with their representatives, there should be more incentive for the senator to keep the interests of the populace closer to being equal with the interests of the state. Unfortunately, once elected to either the house or the senate, the elected official has an incredibly high statistical chance of keeping their seat because of name recognition and the higher campaign contributions they earn from the businesses who&#39;s interests they serve which makes it nearly impossible to unseat them.<br /><br />Diane Feinstein has been in office too long and she has grown too xomfortable and this is proof she needs to be voted out because this is clearly proof that she doesn&#39;t have thw best interests of her constituents at heart and in her mind. She voted for the Patriot Act as use of force in Iraq both of which put the interests of other entities above her state and constituents with the use of force serving the Federal Reserve Banking Families to protect the petrodollar and the patriot act to further the interests of the intelligence agencies aged further their clandestine operations abroad building Banana Republics.<br /><br />The majority of people who eschew the Global Climate Change isn&#39;t man-made ahs is a scam or a hoax truly lack a solid understanding of the most basic principles of science and often use the common or legal definitions for scientific terms and not the definitions that science uses, like the term theory. Many if them cannot truly tell you how the land, water and air processes on this planet work or what causes seasons and why it works that way. When the complexity of mathematical terminology is added to it, the confusion often has people citing weather statistics for climate. When pressed most people cannot tell you what variables weather or climate actually tracks, much less how climate and weather fit together. Climate isn&#39;t cyclical and while it has changed drastically since this planet formed, it has never happened this fast and in this profound of a manner. The speed is the problem because most species on this planet can only withstand small deviations in the climate without adverse effects.<br /><br />Now that the ocean temperatures are warmer, the level of methane pouring out of the oceans will surpass the human carbon output and that&#39;s going to make the weather tilt-a-whirl speed up and then things will get interesting.<br /><br />Unfortunately Capitalism ahs the pursuit if wealth right now are more important than planning for and creating a future for our offspring and to cut down on the guilt denial is the order if the day. Claim the changes are normal ahs natural and part of a cycle. The reality will be undeniable at the point of no return mentioned here and the evidence will be the loss of certain fruits add vegetables like chocolate, coffee and bsnsnas as the change in daily temperatures reduces the yields of trees and fungus destroys even more because of monocropping.<br /><br />It will turn gmo from a choice to a necessity as frankenscience tries to maintain normal ahhh reality is like being a frog in a pot if boiling water that rises in temperature so slowly the frog doesn&#39;t feel it wbd therefore does nothibg to escape impending death.

I don't claim this proves anything...but it is worth knowing and considering. 2) The heart of Science is empiricism! If the observations of nature don't match the theory, the theory is wrong. Science is not about agreement, political power, media coverage, what titles or degrees a person has: It is about testing a theory against nature--and a computer model is NOT nature (I worked as a scientist in computer modeling. I am not against computer models, but they are not nature!) It doesn't matter what a study says: that is just assertion.* 3) The predictions put forward over the last thirty years are varied, but most were FAR from what we have since observed. PS I live in Chicago. As I understand it there was a mile of ICE here only 30,000 years ago...now we have the great lakes. So for the last 30,000 years we have seen permanent ice retreating rapidly. This too is worth knowing and considering--because it is pretty quick and dramatic change, that has nothing to do with cars.

The biggest problem with disgussing issues based on science is that the majority of Americans just don't science yet think they understand it enough to bit only form an opinion that runs counter top the unified theories of scientists who are experts in the branches that study weather, climate, the land cycle and water cycle on the this rock. Climate change, she rising temperatures are not new and the signs where noticed around the time scientific journals began to be printed and distributed around the globe add science hasn't changed in a major way since that peer review process began. Coffee production in the early 30s hiccoughed and produced less than the year before even though the number of coffee trees increased exponentially and research pinned the culprit as small as a 1 degree rise I the average daily low temperature during their growing season. They figured out that using shade trees and other methods to counter or lower the daily low temperature could keep the yeilds at the same levels. Climate doesnt change and isn't cyclical and just a few degrees in either direction can cause a major die-off of species. Many amphibians will see either all males if the temperature is too hot and all females if it is too cold. Fish can not handle more that a couple if degrees either way. Don't believe be? Ask any hobbyist who keep herps or fish, both fresh and salt water what a three degree rise in water temperature does to the fish. The majority of people who want to take an opinion that is counter to the majority if the scientific community would be hard pressed to actually poss the final exam for the very basic, entry level classes taught at any community college in the western world and this shows an overwhelming lack of knowledge and understanding of the topic of climate, muchless the astounding lack of a grasp of basic biology ahs the terms associated with it which is why many deniers also fall in to the category of people who deny or want to challenge what is commonly referred to as the theory of evolution. Those same people cannot explain the binomial nomenclature that is the basis for the taxonomical classification and categorization of all life on this planet.
