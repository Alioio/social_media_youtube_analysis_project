Because greenhouse gasses form a layer around our planet which we call the atmosphere. It traps the heat from escaping, and makes life possible on Earth. But as humans add more and more carbon to the carbon equilibrium it becomes unstable, trapping more and more heat, eventually becoming too hot to sustain life. Sea levels rise, ocean floor life is destroyed, and forest fires become commonplace. We are already seeing places being affected by the rising sea levels. It's not just the carbon equilibrium, there is also deforestation, waste, acidification of the water, using up all the natural resources etc. There are too many things to mention.",UCTEnbsF5hNqEh8wlJJJRU7A,1,UghzN0EW2pv68HgCoAEC,3tnDjCA4peY,2015-12-14 20:36:32

This video also never mentions the cost it will take to keep carbon emissions down. Even if every country in the world could meet the agreements, scientists say that the carbon emissions would only change by 1% in 2100.
