I presume god's creation include the environment; That is what I was talking about. Calling someone a fool IS insulting their intelligence by the definitions I provided in my last?! Don't recall ever blaming you for what you propertedly have accomplished, but people are going to get the impression that you think of yourself as smarter than them if you drop it unprompted into conversation. You can get a PhD in subjects other than science, and I doubt getting a PhD in HR for example implies you have more awareness than anyone you would speak to about core science subjects.",UCZ7lfwXed_eXb3H_rT1gzUA,1,UgzIAYKQdWmCEaTtint4AaABAg,2nIMQrpDgaQ,2020-07-28 15:59:50

It is about how others take you deciding to include you have a PhD. Again, if the science is peer reviewed, there should be no need to mention the original author of the research. Fool: ""A silly or stupid person, a person who lacks judgement or sense"". Intelligence: ""The ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills"". Roy Spencer has been quoted as saying that he doesn't believe man can destroy god's creation. God is faith; Science is empirical.

That is what I trust you believe, otherwise we wouldn't be having this discussion. Mentioning you have a PhD will result in the assumption you are proclaiming your intelligence by most. Don't believe me, try engaging another random person on a page of a certain pro-<name your subject> page, mention you have a PhD, and see the reaction. Calling anyone a fool is an insult to their intelligence. Never mentioned green new deal. There is more than 2 viewpoints on the problem and the solution.

You are reading emotion into my reply where there is none intended. I have listened to their talks and haven't seen any peer reviewed articles that cite any actual science from the people you mention, and if I recall correctly nothing more than lamen's explanations of complex data in the videos from them I have seen. I didn't accuse anyone of taking oil finding; I asked if you had considered it. Big difference. I support science that is peer reviewed, not science that isn't. Seeing as the peer review process includes a large body of scientists, there is no need to name every one of them. This is about evidence, not who is disseminating the information. I don't know what you hope to achieve by replying again and again. Do you think I will change my mind and listen to non-peer reviewed science because I just realised this fits my world view. From the getgo I didn't expect the same from you, just wanted to see what sources fits your world view and how deep the rabbit hole goes. I won't insult you by calling you names, just suggest if not already familiar with information bias, it should be looked up.

Like buying insurance) and then there is effects that have lifestyle/life implications, whatever they are caused by. However, I see little point in discussing this further if we don't agree on what 1 degree of warming can do and we don't accept the ""science"" from the same groups. One final thought - You don't think it at least possible that those ""scientists"" you mention are being paid by the fossil fuel industry to hide the truth (if I knew my industry was damaging the environment and didn't care, this would certainly be what I would do. And it isn't the first industry that has had evidence come out of doing similar). Actually, forget the question. The answer is no doubt going to be that the group of scientists I believe must be hiding the truth to get more research money. What a weird world we live in when empirical evidence (what science is based on) can be bent to the world view of each of us.",UCZ7lfwXed_eXb3H_rT1gzUA,1,UgzIAYKQdWmCEaTtint4AaABAg,2nIMQrpDgaQ,2020-07-28 15:59:50

I can't make excuses for the timetable that has been published prior (perhaps the media hyped it up... bad people who break into computer systems are called crackers, not hackers, but clearly one sounded better to the media! ; perhaps the determination wasn't peer reviewed ; perhaps this was their best guess at the time). What can't be denied is the ice caps are melting (pictures from agencies with means to do so; asking the locals; ideally yourself travelling to the poles as close to 1900's as possible given your age and then again now to see for oneself if that is what is needed if no-one else can be trusted to provide accurate info) and the greenhouse effect is the only explanation I have heard/makes sense. If this is unbelievable, one can look at this subject from the perspective of emissions. One wouldn't sit in a well insulated garage with an ICE engine running, unless they wanted to end their life. Earth is a closed ecosystem. Anything that goes in the air is what can be breathed in by us humans. Trees filter out carbon dioxide (though there are less trees these days to suck up all of the emissions than when when we were smaller in population, and when they burn they release this stored carbon), but not a number of other emissions from our modern lifestyle, so them and CO2 have been building up in the atmosphere and affecting (to a greater degree as we continue to put them into the air) our health. From a environmental perspective I really cannot see any logic against reducing emissions.",UCZ7lfwXed_eXb3H_rT1gzUA,1,UgzIAYKQdWmCEaTtint4AaABAg,2nIMQrpDgaQ,2020-07-28 15:59:50
