Of course it is expected to be colder in some areas because climate is being disrupted, the cycles of wind, sea temperature, etc, it will create actually colder areas, as well dryer areas and more chaotic events and variance between winter and summer. But the mean temperature will still be rising. Some countries maybe could have benefits, but the overall majority don't. Many colleagues of mine, being biologists, phycisists that work in weather, etc agree that in my area, that is, the north Andean south American zone, will experience drastic droughts an for longer, many mountains have their ice shrunk every year. Being a forest technician implies that you know everything about your area but I'm pretty sure you know nothing about why does you area is cooling or how can it be predicted. Or talking about Californian fires without proving there are arsonists. And talking about capitalism is just like everything, you can have it the other way around, it can be easily especulated and seen that many oil producers and traditional manufacturers coud have interest in denying a transition to more friendly (sadly not perfect and still contaminating) energy sources. Seriously, just one source about global climate is what I need, and honey, if you are by coincidence watching Prager U or some really political and financially compromised 'source' just stop. You can laugh all you want but from my perspective being sensitive is more important in these times that being close minded. Of course some people will try to benefit from green histeria or some overeacting dinamic, but I still think is worth it that just burying our heads in sand and saying that what happens in a very specific zone is somehow an evidence for very complex and increasingly unpredictable climate patterns. It's actually, pretty unscientific",UC6kGq_flKQC2eS4SZgxEA4g,1,Ugwlxi9mNu78l4MyXBN4AaABAg,JBPMJMAWl5E,2020-02-05 13:54:20

They teach PROPER SCIENTIFIC (had to capitalise so it’s easier for you to read) research that shows Enhanced Climate Change is caused by human emissions. Between roughly 400,000 years ago and 1800 the co2 ppm (parts per million) in the atmosphere never went above 250. Now we’re at over 400. I’m sure you’re wondering how we can go that far back. Well in a nice research station in Antarctica call Vostok along with others, they drill into the ice. Each layer of ice represents a year. Within each layer of ice are air bubbles. They use these air bubbles to measure the co2 ppm and also the ratio of O-18 atoms to O-16 atoms to determine an average temperature. And we know it’s reliable because for recent years the data received from the ice cores show the same things as evidence from trees, and diaries, and global weather stations. So go back to secondary school where they teach it.
