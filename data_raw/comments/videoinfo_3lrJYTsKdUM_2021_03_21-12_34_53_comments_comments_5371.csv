That is &quot;marginal land.&quot; <br />- Marginal land is not suitable for growing crops due to soil quality or not enough water etc. So what can you do with it? <br />-You can have cows graze on the cellulose on this land (again, this land is not suitable for growing edible crops), and turn that cellulose into protein and various nutrients humans need.<br /><br /><b>Ruminant Upcycling</b><br />-33% of that agricultural land mentioned above can be used for crops. (Nice.) This is called &quot;arable land.&quot; <br />-Though, for every 100lbs of human food produced from crops on this land, roughly 37 lbs of inedible plant byproduct is produced. <br />-Cows can eat this inedible plant matter and turn it into protein. <br />-Worthless cellulose + Cow = Human Food<br /><br /><b>Biogenic Carbon Cycle</b> in a nutshell:<br />-Methane has stronger warming potential than CO2 so cow burp is bad, right? Well...<br />-Plants capture carbon from the atmosphere via photosynthesis<br />-Cows eat the plant, take the carbon.<br />-Cows burp out the carbon in the form of methane (remember methane is CH4 - Carbon, 4 Hydrogens)<br />-12 yeas later, Methane is broken down back into carbon dioxide via hydroxyl oxidation.<br />*These carbon molecules are the same molecules that were in the plant the Cow ate.

They do not emit any more carbon dioxide or methane than they take in through grass and other fodder. <br /><br />2. Cattle are not as polluting as fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are dug up from the ground and then burned and go into the atmosphere. It is entirely NEW green house gasses that were previous sequestered deep underground. Cattle does not produce NEW gasses. It converts organic material into meat and waste. Nothing is new. That waste and gasses are taken up by plants and bacteria. That makes it a carbon neutral system.<br /><br />3. Cattle emissions are ground level emissions. They are quickly taken up by plants and bacteria. How else could they grow except by taking up ground level CO2 and other emissions? <br /><br />4. Much cattle production in the US doesn&#39;t require the clearing of forests. They graze in open areas that already exist. Even if areas are cleared this is no different than for any field crop. Perhaps some fruit and nut crops result in some carbon sequestration but that is nothing compared to the forests that existed there before. <br /><br />There are many reasons to not eat meat. Not the least of which is that it is often cruel and wasteful. However, this video falls under the &quot;False Consciousness&quot; rule. They are trying to convince you that it&#39;s really cattle that is causing climate change and not the fossil fuel industry. <br /><br />Make no mistake. The primary threat to our environment comes from fossil fuels and not cows. <br /><br />We could increase cattle production 10 times what it is now on existing grazing and there would be no increase in atmospheric CO2 or methane so long cows would be consuming grass and other fodder as they always have. <br /><br />Finally, much cattle production happens in areas where agriculture is not suitable. The notion that cattle is displacing other types of farms in these areas is untrue. Much of the Southwest is given to cattle because they can graze but have little impact on the other animals in the region. This is absolutely opposite of field crops which require the bulldozing of fields and the slaughter of every animal and plant in that area to make room for one single field crop (like corn, or soybeans). Then that field is cleansed every year with a new slaughter to make room for the next crop and this includes the use of pesticides and herbicides (which aren&#39;t used in cattle industry). In this sense, cattle production is much less cruel than soybean or wheat production. Not only do the cattle coexist with many other animals but also when you eat a hamburger you&#39;ve only killed one animal. Eat a soyburger and you&#39;ve killed hundreds.",UCmKZPieqSu6GfoVBZ2l7scQ,0,UgzCrbhXA4qFxhidpM94AaABAg,3lrJYTsKdUM,2020-05-13 12:00:01

The statement &quot;beef industry causes global warming&quot; is only true in West, where there is seperate industrial livestock farming for meat. Those breed are fast-growing high weight-gaining category specially grown for meat. They are not much useful for dairy industry, which has other type of breeds. In India, there is no industrial livestock farming for beef. Almost all methane emissions in India is from cattle grown for milk. Our dairy farmers and farms give them for slaughter only once they run dry (no more able to produce milk) which forms major part of beef supply in India. For small farmers, this is the money they use to buy next cow. In fact, beef consumption in India helps reduce methane emission, because they remove such cattle from population, which otherwise will continue to emit it. Point is, dairy farms are major culprits. If anybody genuinely cares about this issue, the best way is reverse &quot;White revolution&quot; and promote reduction milk consumption.",UCnwjxOKszaDbu4CbF4bLWkA,0,UgxvPrVdErx-b5BnTHp4AaABAg,3lrJYTsKdUM,2020-05-13 12:00:01

As a whole if land in areas where soils are depleted or is subject to desertification then it would help the environment locally.

The statement ""beef industry causes global warming"" is only true in West, where there is seperate industrial livestock farming for meat. Those breed are fast-growing high weight-gaining category specially grown for meat. They are not much useful for dairy industry, which has other type of breeds. In India, there is no industrial livestock farming for beef. Almost all methane emissions in India is from cattle grown for milk. Our dairy farmers and farms give them for slaughter only once they run dry (no more able to produce milk) which forms major part of beef supply in India. For small farmers, this is the money they use to buy next cow. In fact, beef consumption in India helps reduce methane emission, because they remove such cattle from population, which otherwise will continue to emit it. Point is, dairy farms are major culprits. If anybody genuinely cares about this issue, the best way is reverse ""White revolution"" and promote reduction milk consumption.",UCnwjxOKszaDbu4CbF4bLWkA,1,Ugx_QBLadJwXOkOcEyB4AaABAg,3lrJYTsKdUM,2020-05-13 12:00:01

Also, what about regenerative agriculture and the need to use animal feces in order to avoid using fertilizers to gain topsoil and sequester more carbon? What about raising animals on grasslands not suitable for agriculture? Also, animals can be fed bacteria to change there microbiome in order to severely reduce their methane production. There is no doubt that the way most animals are raised not is terrible but a regenerative agriculture model is better for the environment than a vegan model due to the increased topsoil, reduced fertilizers and increased carbon sequestering in the soil. If people are informed about better choices they will demand it and suppliers will fulfill this demand.<br />For water-use, almonds use a lot but they can only grow in a very specific climate. In the US cattle farmers use the same region. If the cattle farmers converted to almond farming then the cattle could be raised in a region with more water and a different climate.

Livestock raisers already have a hard time making money off of live meat the way it is. Anyway, agriculture is an extremely complex process and I don’t expect you or this video to completely understand the entire thing. The video mostly talked about farming beef in the rainforests without mentioning livestock raising in the United States or other parts of the world where we have hilly prairies with rock patches and varying climates that cannot be used to grow crops with current agricultural technology. They actually believe that we could convert all areas used for cattle into rice fields and such when this simply isn’t the case. In fact, cultivating native grasses to make way for other crops negatively impacts the environment. There are certain methods of raising beef that take carbon out of the air but I won’t go into detail. As you know, cattle produce manure. This is a far better alternative for fertilizer than the synthetic chemicals used otherwise.

I don&#39;t want to type out an essay but the fact that animal agriculture has a bad reputation is only partly based on facts. I am really curious about which sources were used here for example bc in our university most of the stats tell a different story, that beef is contributing to it, but not the biggest cause for climate change.<br /><br />Most of us folks who are active in the agricultural field are trying our best to improve farming practices etc. but most people I&#39;ve met (profs, farmers, vets) aren&#39;t against beef production/animal agriculture. And I&#39;ll take their word over that of youtube channels/news outlets any day.<br /><br />I am honestly a bit surprised about this video bc I genuinely enjoy most of vox&#39;s content.

The world agriculture society has found that we have around 60 years worth of harvest left due to the way we have degraded our soil due to poor farming practices such as monocultures where a single kind of crop is grown over and over again with the use of synthetic fertilises and sprays. I seriously encourage people to look up “white oak pastures” they are producing beef and other animal products with a carbon negative out put (which means they are taking more carbon out of the atmosphere then what they’re producing). sustainable agriculture is no longer good enough we need to move to a regenerative agriculture system which needs grazing animals.,UCMf_-uc4H2yH79fd7wIPBKA,1,UgyY5R74K5uGC7e7aaN4AaABAg,3lrJYTsKdUM,2020-05-13 12:00:01

But I think it might give a more honest picture of how polluting a type of food is if you factor in the amount of calories per kg. For instance producing 1 kg of wheat results in more emissions than producing 1 kg of tomatoes. But when looking at how much you would need to eat a day to sustain your needs you need a lot more kg of tomatoes then kg of wheat.<br /><br />A quick Google results in whole grain wheat having 3400 calories per kg and tomatoes having only 177 calories per kg. A more then 19 times difference. This to me at least makes eating wheat a better option then eating tomatoes. When only looking at the environmental impact and not at the amount of micronutrients or fiber.<br /><br />Would love to hear what you think!,UC2HmCWbtE8nMUNb_E4E3r0A,0,UgwWQgWgYs8YUVubu6Z4AaABAg,3lrJYTsKdUM,2020-05-13 12:00:01

The statement ""beef industry causes global warming"" is only true in West, where there is seperate industrial livestock farming for meat. Those breed are fast-growing high weight-gaining category specially grown for meat. They are not much useful for dairy industry, which has other type of breeds. In India, there is no industrial livestock farming for beef. Almost all methane emissions in India is from cattle grown for milk. Our dairy farmers and farms give them for slaughter only once they run dry (no more able to produce milk) which forms major part of beef supply in India. For small farmers, this is the money they use to buy next cow. In fact, beef consumption in India helps reduce methane emission, because they remove such cattle from population, which otherwise will continue to emit it. Point is, dairy farms are major culprits.

Methane production from cows DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE TO GLOBAL WARMING. Cows are part of a natural carbon cycle. They eat grass/grain, made of carbon which was fixed from CO2 in the atmosphere. They eat the grass and digest it. They then emit CO2 and methane, carbon which was already located in the grass and is now in the air again to be fixed by plants. It is completely separate from fossil fuel carbon, which is introduction CO2 into the air which had been trapped in rocks for millions of years. The number of cows in the United States has not been increasing, in fact it has been decreasing in the past two decades due to genetics and better management practice. This means that beef/dairy production has actually contributed to global cooling! Also, looking at these systems from a global standpoint doesn&#39;t make sense. Beef you and I eat comes from America, where we literally have millions of acres of ground in the western part of the United States which is too poor to grow crops on but is only adequate for ruminant use (animals which turn stuff we cannot eat, such as grass, into extremely nutritious foods). This one misconception about GHG emissions alone (due to kg CO2 equivalents which are not a good way to compare livestock to other industries) is creating extremely dangerous misconceptions against farmers/ranchers and their products.",UC_BDjVaoOkHoZDLKPmlywIw,0,UgyTyxDM6kpyZLz51NN4AaABAg,3lrJYTsKdUM,2020-05-13 12:00:01

Even if we assume that, i realise these impact calculations are per kg, but especially considering how much milk is needed for some dairy products, I don't see how the difference in impact can be that large. At least in the lower quality sectors of production (which are probably the bulk of the market in meat production) no cow is given much land to graze on, and cows are slaughtered as early as possible, meaning that dairy cows would be living and burping etc way longer. MAybe my very rough and off the top of my head calculations are faulty but then I would say it is certainly a problem with this chart that it is per kg and thus doesn't take consumption into account, because surely people consume dairy products in greater quantities plus more readily and unthinkingly than steaks.",UCST-fEEwLx8-QNo1qmiJ2fw,1,Ugw3QtwMLiWQjg8mvDx4AaABAg,3lrJYTsKdUM,2020-05-13 12:00:01

We have many places in the world that have had or are facing zero days. In Australia, we have a &#39;&quot;water buyback&quot; scheme for the Murray-Darling Basin (Australia&#39;s food bowl. Which stretches from Queensland through NSW all the way to Victoria). It was meant to be a way of balancing the use of water by limiting the volume of water that farmers could extract from the river. The government &#39;buys back&#39; water entitlements from growers, thereby reducing the amount of water taken from the river. <br /><br />Now you don&#39;t need to be a farmer to own water entitlements, in fact the Chinese and the US are the biggest investors in our water entitlements. The government was caught paying $80 million of tax payers money to company that is registered to the Cayman Islands.<br /><br />Last year during our summer (which is very dry) water stopped flowing in the rivers causing large blue-green algae blooms which starved oxygen to all the fish. Millions of fish were killed and seen floating in the river. While there was a drought and lot of finger pointing on to blame, what we need to remember is that the basin can only support so much. Why are we growing things like cotton, chestnuts and rice? Things that require so much water. We should be growing things that suit our climate.

It would also limit biodiversity if we were to only raise cattle in a sertain enviorment. There would also be logistical problems like where would all the food for cattle be produces and how much emissions would it produce with transportation included. There would also be the problem of antibiotic resistanse wich is growing at an alarming rate the more we consume animal products. Those animals are pumped full of meds to keep them from getting disease. Around 85-90% of the worlds antibiotics are used within animal agriculture. Those same animals are still creating greenhouse gasses like CO2 and methane when they are alive. At this rate we are raising and killing millions of animals per day just to keep up with the demand for meat etc. It doesn't matter where they are raised they still weaken biodiversity everywhere wich also contributes to climate change.

When cows have a diet of pasture grasses instead of corn and grain, they produce far less methane. They also have the opportunity to support grass root growth through grazing which sequesters carbon. I agree that humans should eat less beef, but I also think they should eat better beef. Please consider supporting local organic cattle farmers. There are people out there doing it right, and eating beef can be a positive thing to support them and the environment. Another thing to think about is the fertilizer cows can provide in a positive farm system. If we hope to move away from chemical fertilizers which contaminate land, water, and wildlife we need to pursue sustainable fertilizers. Cattle can contribute to this system with their manure. Overall this issue is incredibly complicated but the most important thing to realize is not all cattle are raised equally (both environmentally and ethically) and it’s possible to be an active consumer and choose good beef!",UCI4jHcVrCVWSqiEjGOMp35A,0,Ugw4Imj6ZQ5QbX1FAJp4AaABAg,3lrJYTsKdUM,2020-05-13 12:00:01

While I cannot know for certain, I do not think you are actually allergic to beef. I'm a vegetarian, I have been since I was three years old, so I haven't eaten any meat or fish for a solid amount of time. And of course, because of this, my body doesn't produce enough enzymes and stuff to actually process and digest meat. Thus if I tried eating a hamburger right now, I'd end up extremely sick. However, there have been a number of vegetarians and vegans who at one point stop being vegetarian/vegan. They also end up being sick if they don't GRADUALLY add meat back into their diet. Your body, unless you are truly allergic, still has those enzymes to digest meat, just not enough of them by a long shot, and thus you'll end up making yourself sick. So people trying to get back into eating meat, have to do it very gradually, its a process because you are basically teaching your body how to digest meat again. Of course, I can't know if you are truly allergic or not, nor are you required to actually go and eat meat again, but I've seen enough people think they are allergic to meat when they really are just adding it into their diet too quickly.",UC95Mc-1po1czbSz0zfYFN7A,1,UgygvhDFh41qSOJxSX54AaABAg,3lrJYTsKdUM,2020-05-13 12:00:01

A better alternate is to think about the affects outside of the cycle, and try to source local goods instead of shipping goods from around the world. The more local the product the better it is, as it is the products that have to be shipped (cocoa products, cheep meats and unnative crops) that have the damaging affect on our planet.

So in the end, even though it is a good action, it is not addressing the real problem. What we should do is DEMAND A CHANGE in the way beef is raised and produced, so we address the real problem. <br /><br />If you want some information and you care about our soils you can find interesting some of the following topics/examples: regenerative agriculture, the savory institute, Rodale institue or just permaculture. Also great examples are Joel Salatin, Joyce Farms, Charles Massy or Stoney Creek Farm. Maybe you have a farm near where you live and you can take action. Buying beef from this kind of farms is the best way to change practices and habits in this industry. Cows, bison, etc.. can actually be one of the best tools we have (along with biochar) to store carbon in our soils and reverse climate change.<br /><br />But I’m not saying let’s eat a cow a day so we can reduce climate change, I’m saying reduce your intake and we you actually buy beef try to buy it from regenerative farms (local being the ideal).<br /><br />Hope this is useful for someone.

One is methane deposits in the seafloor that are being released. Also, as arctic ice melts in Siberia, Canada, and Greenland methane deposits from the permafrost underneath is being released. Finally, in the US, the rise of fracking has resulted in the fracking process leaking lots of methane into the atmosphere. NASA has tracked a huge rise in methane emissions from what's called the Permian Basin, which is the land in the midwest US where fracking is the most prevalent. Methane is probably a big contributor to the reason why global warming seems to be happening faster than predicted. If you just use CO2 in the predictions and leave out methane, you will get less warming which takes longer to reach tipping point levels.

It still won't make that much of a difference if it is implemented on top of some of the measures I've mentioned. It is just insignificant. Additionally, when you force people to follow such useless rules, people simply won't comply which will create other problems. I don't think people would be happy to forcefully go vegetarian.

You can come to the conclusion that the positive in this case does not outweigh the negatives, I would differ, that is something everyone will have to answer for themselves. But I do think that most people, at least in my home country, actually do support such measures making specific products more expensive, that has been shown by several surveys. It is thus, in my opinion, an acceptbale solution if, and that is important, you make this solution work for the ones not being able to have the choice do buy higher priced goods because of their lack of income and wealth, meaning once again the social compensation I mentioned. Normally I´d say you were right, freedoms shoudl be protected even against the general common good, in this case though the climate crisis is of such importance that, as I said, even these more darstic measures have to be taken. And I do think that it would make quite a big change if you pair it with several similar mesaures, as it has been said in the video the emissions by this sector makes up, if I remember correctly, nearly 30% of the averages persons emmissions, a factor quite easy to lower.",UChX_aKBZs21fm9G3ZP-76Lg,1,UgxdFZSaeGyIK0XuZSh4AaABAg,3lrJYTsKdUM,2020-05-13 12:00:01

Cows, while big producers of methane, have the incredible ability to aid in carbon SEQUESTRATION through the fertility their manure provides to land. Since the demand of beef is so high and people eat so much of it (just eat less), farmers have been pressured to raising beef the most profitable way, typically not through responsible practices. But by no means are cows the problem, we are. Instead cows could actually be part of the solution through responsible holistic management like intensive rotational grazing and composting on site. The reality of crops and beef being raised separately disrupts the possible cycle of fertility that could actually aid in soil building, and offset the methane emissions a herd produced.",UCPfGiSmPA1kqq6FU85qs7OA,0,UgzgfvvCiibOFDQuhuB4AaABAg,3lrJYTsKdUM,2020-05-13 12:00:01

The statement ""beef industry causes global warming"" is only true in West, where there is seperate industrial livestock farming for meat. Those breed are fast-growing high weight-gaining category specially grown for meat. They are not much useful for dairy industry, which has other type of breeds. In India, there is no industrial livestock farming for beef. Almost all methane emissions in India is from cattle grown for milk. Our dairy farmers and farms give them for slaughter only once they run dry (no more able to produce milk) which forms major part of beef supply in India. For small farmers, this is the money they use to buy next cow. In fact, beef consumption in India helps reduce methane emission, because they remove such cattle from population, which otherwise will continue to emit it. Point is, dairy farms are major culprits. If anybody genuinely cares about this issue, the best way is reverse ""White revolution"" and promote reduction milk consumption.",UCnwjxOKszaDbu4CbF4bLWkA,1,UgxwhFxJ5I_Eg72Ly1F4AaABAg,3lrJYTsKdUM,2020-05-13 12:00:01

It’s not hard to understand.<br />Earth is a greenhouse naturally thanks to CO2, O2, CH4, N2O, and others. Without them Earth won’t be habitable, but add too much, you offset the climate. Everything is balanced. But humans are dramatically offsetting that balance and sending Earths into rapid warming 20x faster than the rate it took us heading into the PETM 56 million years ago. When our planet was 3° to 4° cooler 20,000 years ago, North America was covered in an ice sheet several hundred feet thick, the modern Holoence gave rise to modern humanity, 4° or 5°C hotter than today in just a century. Human civilization will struggle. <br />And it sickens me when people say “it’s a scam a hoax” when scientists are trying to address an issue, science is important, it saves lives, being in denial, you cause problems. I really wish sometimes people in politics were actual scientists so we<br />can fix these problems. <br />Climate change is real and the solution is easier than the problem but either people are ignorant or just don’t care and don’t act. I’m not saying we have 12 years to live, and humanity (maybe) could adapt to it, but why risk it and make our future generations suffer? <br />While Global Warming and Cooling events in Earths history have never completely wiped out life on Earth.

Every 230-260 years the suns output of heat and light drops to a low point. Our sun is a dynamo that generates output, stable enough it does vary due to conditions within. Valentina Zharkova, a mathematician and Astrophysicist used Nasa data to develop a predictive algorithm that supports and explains why this occurs. Three distinct areas of circulating plasma, always interracting, sometimes inhibit and at other times reinforce generated wavelength strength. If you understand anything about electricity you will understand three phase output is greater than a single phase. Then think of a motor that ramps up or down, its output varies, as does its corresponding magnetic field strength. The sun presently is at the lowest point of magnetic fieldcstrength invhundreds of years. Our history clearly shows this happens repeatedly, the last being the dark ages, where heightened volcanic and earthquake activity took place. Temperatures began to cool and winter season became longer with each passing year. The cycle lasts about 30-50 years. Roy Spencer was a Nasa scientist tasked with running a planned experiment, using satellite data to prove the Greenhouse effect. Spencers conclusion was that the effect was minimal and certainly far less than expected. So what did proven science do. Criticized and then ignored him. This is how an agenda works. Dont take my word for it. Research: Henrik Svensmark Valentina Zharkova Roy Spencer About three months ago, a Euorpean organization representing 23 different countries petitioned the UN towards holding open discussion on climate change.

Beef, poultry and the entire meat industry is heavily subsidized by taxpayers, whether it's imported or domestic. While produce and plant based foods are better for the environment, the cost to consumers is much higher. That's just one of the reasons why a lot of working class and poor people eat meat rich diets. If we readjusted our legislative priorities in terms of how we subsidize food production and made the cost of meat reflect its true cost to our society, far fewer people would eat it as often. This is a market solution to the problem, which conservatives praise as the best way to approach public policy, yet they steadfastly oppose such ideas by falsely labeling it as government controlling what you can or can't eat, because meat producing companies are a big contributor to GOP politicians.",UCslEOPWsGst1QpshM3uq_3g,1,UgzlYyrl3GwD751_PhF4AaABAg,3lrJYTsKdUM,2020-05-13 12:00:01

When it's between survival and basic needs versus protecting the planet, people will try to find ways to survive. It's hard to think about reducing, reusing, and recycling when you live in an apartment with no heat in the middle of winter. People also were taught wrong. The hierarchy of what's important for someone to work on for climate change became recycle, reuse, reduce instead of reduce, reuse, and recycle. I see this happen because people just recycle anything they think can be recycled (which 30% if the time they're wrong) because they're helping. Chicago has warehouses full of cardboard because they do not have the capacity to process the amount they get. This phenomena is also part of society. You can't go up to someone who has been living the life of fast fashion for two decades and convince them to stop even if they have the financial means to. You have to speak their language in order to get them to understand. For some people, that's the news. Others, movies and entertainment is more effective. The bottom line is though, many are told and understand the threat and are also in poverty struggling to survive. In my humble opinion, the world should focus on improving public transportation and building cities in a way that supports public transit rather than places like the US where streets built for roads are everywhere. Not only does public transportation reduce climate change, affordable and accessible transportation is the number one factor in getting people out of poverty. If people have more money, they can focus on what they're buying more rather than finding the cheapest meal options.",UCbj167fDwdpFO__HPa_SYzw,1,UgzlYyrl3GwD751_PhF4AaABAg,3lrJYTsKdUM,2020-05-13 12:00:01
