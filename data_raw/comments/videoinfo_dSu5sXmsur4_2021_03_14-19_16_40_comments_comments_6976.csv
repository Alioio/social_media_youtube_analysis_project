Most of the waste and pollution from China is from plastics and waste that countries like the US have shipped over to be ‚Äúrecycled‚Äù (aka, pushed under the rug), and from US industries that have moved their production abroad to take advantage of lax regulations on things like worker pay, safety, etc. Most of the growth of these unsustainable industries are promoted by western companies aiming to make a quick buck. China itself is not necessarily even ‚Äúcommunist,‚Äù considering for the most part it‚Äôs adopted what is essentially state-controlled capitalism. Our current economic system promotes the practices of unsustainable growth and profit-margins, and if left unchecked in a pure ‚Äúcapitalist‚Äù standpoint, companies would be even more out of control. Hell, look at all of the shit Nestle has pulled over the past few years, from trying to assert that ‚Äúwater is not a human right‚Äù and attempting to sieze control of water supplies in dry areas, and forcing baby formula on mothers in poor areas so they become reliant on their product, which increased infant mortality rates in those areas. You‚Äôre directing a lot of vitriol towards the benefactors of the ‚Äúcaptialist USA,‚Äù but you‚Äôre also lauding the system that encourages their behavior. Also slightly unrelated, but you also said establishing a family garden like its a bad thing, lol. I understand what you‚Äôre getting at, but I would say there‚Äôs nothing wrong with practicing more self reliance on vital industries. If you keep vital functions such as food production or the water supply out of your own hands, (particularly if it‚Äôs placed into privately owned hands) its a lot easier for that outside party to establish control over things and manipulate the system.",UCDKiM2cGviOLEwO9DcOVg6Q,1,UgwVnGvu0AICP5FRjvN4AaABAg,dSu5sXmsur4,2020-10-27 15:00:02

Second, the USA has historically emitted 25% of CO2 emissions, the most of any country. China has emitted 13%. The USA is among the worst-performing countries when it comes to climate change.

Simple really. Its much more efficient for the humans to just eat fruits and veggies directly and not bother so much with meat. Thats why more effort should be put into making a wider variety of vegan dishes mainstream should be happening.

Fossil fuels aren't the only problem. Plastics are equally dangerous to the environment because they harm the ocean ecosystem which produces HALF of the world's oxygen. If the governments try to appease the fossil fuel industry by essentially offering them an alternative use well... That alternative use is even more dangerous the planet because we would go from slowly cooking to slowly asphyxiating and starving. That's the problem here, in order for our activities to become environmentally neutral, fossil fuels NEED to die. There's no way around that. They are far too wasteful and poisonous to use in pretty much any form. Of course, the fossil fuel industry knows this and that's why it collectively uses its power and influence to convince the world that there are NO alternatives even when there clearly are; sure, they are more expensive but they are certainly there. Money makes the world go around and in the end it's money which will make it stop going around unless something radical is done. BUT of course, due to how much the world's production relies on fuels, the governments can't just axe the entire industry because doing so would be tantamount to economic suicide and mass riots and anarchy. Like I said it's a very delicate situation and sadly, due to other circumstances, most of the politicians in our time are faaar too inept to deal with it properly, so they choose to ignore it.

It would be like 50 years or more for places like Argentina or the like for example. You are right. Also I agree there's a lot of big money in the oil industry, which is why they need to be convinced that they would not be out of work by switching from burning the petrochemicals to using them in polymers and plastics. It would just be shifting from using it in the energy industry into the manufacturing industry as a material. Thats how to make it palatable to corporatists. You also cannot expect them to switch in the next 5 years either, you'd need a 10-20 year plan, pushed by the public at large. I think there is a lot of common ground to be had from everyone if you just focus on how to make the transition positive for everyone, including businesses. How can we make it profitable? How can we make energy cleaner? How can we use more polymers and plastics in manufacturing? What can we do with the new supply of oil that opens up when we slow down and ultimately stop burning oil in petrochemical power plants? Lots of points to cover.

I mean, It's not like there are huge multibillion dollar businesses built on those resources which will fight tooth and nail to make sure something like that doesn't happen. That's the problem here my guy, Nuclear energy might be safer, heck it might even be more profitable in the long term but in the short term, fossil fuels industries have too much power and influence to allow a movement like that to happen. It's much easier to keep doing what they've been doing for a hundred years rather than change their entire mode of operation. Short term profits at the expense of the environment. Also, What about developing or underdeveloped countries which are barely holding their own economy together already? Well, they are simply going to be unable to sustain themselves. What happens when a country doesn't have enough resources to sustain itself? It tries to take it from others, willingly or unwillingly through wars. Climate change is a multilayered and complex problems. It can't be solved just by eliminating fossil fuels or ""going nuclear"". It is a global problem which requires more finesse to solve rather than just ""hit it with a hammer until it goes away"". Simply eliminating trade or production of fossil fuels globally is something that would have enormous consequences unless it is done so in a very methodical and coordinated way over several decades with the cooperation of most countries. Sadly, most politicians nowadays only care about what happens in the very short term, so a global plan which takes decades seems quite unlikely. Plus, to make things even worse, a lot of people still think climate change is a complete hoax or some unimportant problem a thousand years down the line despite evidence to the contrary (Remember what I said about the influence of the fossil fuel industry?)

For one, corporations as kurzgesagt points out could just use the time to delay transitioning which according to climate alarmists would make the environment worse off than it already is. Beyond this, the technical problems they point out with the termination phase of no longer performing geoengineering could produce an unavoidable catastrophic bounce in climate when we terminate. There's also the risks that aren't mentioned here with manipulation of the public through fear mongering into using unproven techniques for world altering purposes. There's tons of issues at play, for example the United States wouldn't be able to handle the issue alone, it would be an international (cough cough CHINA) effort requirement to get there, and there's just no way you can convince everyone to get on board because of the self interests of nations. Really instead of trying to 'buy time' as climate alarmists claim, we should just go nuclear. Nuclear is fat and away the most superior model bottom line for everyone involved, capitalists, corporatists, the public in general, environmentalists... everyone. In my opinion that's where the focus needs to be, not a bunch of unproven unreliable technologies or techniques like wind, solar, or now this geoengineering. Just go nuclear and shut down petroleum burning electric grid power plants. That by itself would solve like 40% of the issie environmentalists are screaming about.

You see, not all industries work exactly in the same crude manner. Just because a bunch of industries do it in one area for instance, it can't be assumed that all the industries do the exact same thing. Ever heard of euthanization? There are legal laws in several countries to ensure that animals die as painlessly as possible (through those electric bolts for instance) in such meat industries. The same applies to the way you generalised that smoking adverts still exist globally when in some areas, it is illegal to exhibit smoking adverts. The list goes on... I think your argument as a whole would sound very authentic if you considered being less ""generalistic"" and considered that there are anomalies that exist.

As it turns out, we actually have a pretty good idea of what chemistry occurs at different altitudes and how different atmospheric species are coupled together in complicated reaction cycles. The kinetics is quite extensively modelled for important species, and so we have a good idea about the rate of formation and decay of key species. We can use these existing models to simulate the impact of dropping these SO2 aerosols on the chemistry and physics of the atmosphere. What I meant with my previous post is that if this is to actually become a real possibility, it will require multiple (perhaps every) government to agree on a method and work together in achieving it. Since it has many possible side effects, it would have to be simulated and then trialled experimentally (perhaps on small scale isolated regions of the atmosphere) before rolling out across the world. Because it is such a massive project with potentially devastating side effects, the chances of human error are low.

You are assuming that the individuals in control will be willing to listen to reason, logic, and experts when sadly that is not the case [as can be seen in Mr. Trump]. They (most) will [and i guess have to due to their environment] only pursue things if they can cling onto power for longer or get large sums of money. That of course does not mean we shouldn't be trying our best in the hopes of bettering everything or that we shouldn't 'trust' the government because I understand that it's essential for any sense of civility in the world. I just think that we should be more vigilant of the fact that collectively as 'humans' we have nasty habits which make me hesitant to trust someone with anything of this scope.

It is thought to be caused by small particles of dust kicked out of the engine or blown off the body of the plane. To know why this happens, you have to learn what cloud seeding is, a cloud isn't white because of Water vapor but because of tiny droplets accumulated around specks of dust/sand/dirt/bacteria. It takes some perturbation in the medium for it to crystalize or condense. If there is a lot of humidity in altitude, a cloud might form on the trail of the plane, regardless of the type of engine, an electrical plane can cause a chemtrail to some extent. If you see a plane creating a trail and then stopping, it might have flown away from the more humid area or there might not be enough particles to cause a cloud anymore. Now there is also fuel dumping, IIRC planes sometimes dump some fuel before landing to get lighter, but they never do it above inhabited areas, and it would be wrong to assume they all do this mistake. Some planes might be using really cheap fuels wich produce soot in the exhaust, giving again the opportunity for water vapor to condense into a cloud, again, depending on dryer and wetter pockets of air, you might see these planes leave inconsistent trails.(vapor clouds cannot form in arid pockets of air) Now for why the following day it rains. Clouds form with humidity. Chemtrails cannot form without humidity, and neither can natural clouds. If there is high humidity, it is not surprising for it to rain the day after. But again, if I used the conditional is because they are just the most likely explanations, there might be other phenomenons at play or even a conspiracy for that matter. It would be wrong to completely dismiss the less likely theories as they might turn out right. Science doesn't work by proving right but by proving wrong, and currently we cannot be certain if some individuals lie or not, this is why some conspiracies shouldn't be completely ignored.",UC6AyKECAuGFD7O620URcwHg,1,UgwCPTjQA3eS6rOSuux4AaABAg,dSu5sXmsur4,2020-10-27 15:00:02

The only reason java isn‚Äôt added to any other device, is because the code is written in javascript (it‚Äôs in the name) because, Notch knew how to work with javascript. When Minecraft became property of Microsoft, they wanted a version that could be played on a multitude of platforms, so they rewrote the game but in C++ this time. The downside of that is that there are more limitations to that coding language, which is why quite some features that are available in Java are not available in Bedrock. Yes there are some things that is possible on Bedrock and not on Java, but Java wins in the features aspect. Another thing is that it is far easier to mod in javascript, so the devs have monetised the crap out of stuff on Bedrock that can be made by players for free on Java.",UC_di5e40GaUeqq6ebQjH8-Q,1,UgyeH_uhanoawGU2Hy54AaABAg,dSu5sXmsur4,2020-10-27 15:00:02

The problem isn't that high CO2 or global temperature will kill the planet. The planet will survive just fine, and eventually the life on it will find some way to adapt too even if most of the existing species perished in the process. Therefore it is of limited use for us to look at how the planet was millions of years in the past. The real issue is that existing human and animal life has no chance to adapt anywhere near quickly enough to the current trend - so we can suffer major trauma from it in the coming generations. If we have to completely restructure food production, abandon population centers near the existing coast due to sea-level rise (about 50% of the earth's current population) ect. then this will come at a massive massive cost. It is not the kind of thing that we could easily achieve in even 50-100 years since basically all of current civilization is invested in, and dependent upon, the status-quo. In my mind this is just as much as cost/benefit analysis as anything. Preventing catastrophic levels of global climate change will be far cheaping than trying to adapt to it in the long run - and we also avoid so many unforeseen (potentially disastrous) consequences - because nobody really knows how bad things could get if we go past a point of no return where reversing the changes will become practically impossible.",UCdkB8LNccZOOeJH-55UHPSA,1,UgzEI9UuyVSG8LPa8-x4AaABAg,dSu5sXmsur4,2020-10-27 15:00:02

It can't substitute for a real solution, but it can allow us to make the needed changes over a much longer period of time - which in turn would allow a much softer impact on productivity, as well as allow new technology to come to the scene. So my point is that I don't think we can shortcut around the fact that we have to reduce the CO2 emissions - which will no doubt take a lot of effort and money. It's not JUST a global temperature problem we are talking about after all. If it was then it would be a lot simpler. The chemical composition of so much added CO2 has it's own impacts regardless of if we can ""hack"" a solution for the temperature.

But instead of doing it like more crowded countries (which is almost any other country of the world) almost everyone in the USA owns a house and a large one at that. And companies / factories don't build high but wide instead - having everything in just 2-3 floors is common in the USA whereas in China, European countries or Japan you see a much larger focus on height and almost noone owns a house - most people live in apartments in large houses where dozens of families (or at least 4-8) live.

You always had smaller players. People just refuse to acknowledge them because it ruins the anti-capitalist narrative. And I'll gladly see if you can show me.

Btw, BLM as an organization are fundamentally racist. You can read that on their website. Anyway, you can spread awareness. That's part of what Kurtzgesagt does. The moment you have enough people, the influential people with huge voices can start a campaign (like team trees or smth) and they can easily get things done. Police brutality and justice is in the purview of government anyway because it's a matter force and rights. Environmentalism has nothing to do with the government. So we don't need them. They can only limit what we can do. Yes, they have resources but those resources are mismanaged. We are better off doing it ourselves. Even with smaller budgets we get a lot more done (charities help more people than governments all over the world and it's not even close). Education shouldn't be a government endeavor. It's a service that teachers provide. All schools should be private. A lot will be a little more expensive but run better. Some will be free through donations and run better. Some will be cheap to tap the poorer demographic. It will be better than government schools. It will cost less. It will be run better. It will produce better services and ultimately better people. You can then use that avenue to spread whatever messages you want, like a cool way for kids to participate in global warming campaigns or smth. You can do a lot of things when the government is outside the picture. Because you are literally free to do anything as long as you don't violate rights. Kurtzgesagt is fantastic because they can easily talk to someone like Mr Beast or PewDiePie and those can make Elon Musk get involved and so on and so forth. But. As long as the government is involved with the energy sector, you will never have permission to act because lobbies will stop you. Lobbies exist because people involve the government in things it shouldn't. Part of the whole BLM police brutality problem is not that police do police things against black people. It's that the motive is usually related to drugs. When it shouldn't even be a factor. The drug war is moronic. It's because the government is involved in something that has nothing to do with it. Drugs don't violate anyone's rights (except if they are distributed to minors). So every problem. You see, it's because of government involvement. That includes big tech companies and ""monopolies"" like Facebook. They are in bed with the government (we literally ask the government to regulate them for some fking reason) and then they get laws that smaller competitors can't stand by or they get subsidies which means smaller competitors can't compete in price. Government is almost always the problem. It's NEVER the solution. Never. Poor education, police brutality, anti-competitive markets, bad environments, leeches, fraud, expensive standards of living, expensive healthcare, etc, etc. It's all because the government is involved and the big players play with it in order to kill competition by hitting themselves with regulations they can work with. The government is never the solution. It's always the problem. But we involve the government because the ethics of the culture cannot allow individuals to make their own decisions. Altruism is king which results in wanting the government as philosopher kings to decide what should be done everywhere. That's immoral and that's inefficient. Don't. Involve.

Including the things you mentioned (education, economy, internet.) We could definitely do things like protesting and fundraising but unless we get support from influential people (celebrities, wealthy people in general) it won‚Äôt ever compare to the amount of impact the government could make, even with help from influential people. This was shown through the BLM protests. Many people took to the streets, influential people spread awareness, it was practically a world wide thing. However, police and further law enforcement shot rubber bullets and things were eventually shut down. Months later, Derek Chauvin was released from prison, many other victims of police brutality still haven‚Äôt seen justice (ex. Breonna Taylor) and there have been no major improvements made to law enforcement. The thing is me, you, other people scrolling through this thread, are normal everyday people. We can protest, fundraise, educate, raise awareness, vote, but we do not (and will not for presumably a while) have nearly as much power as the government. The government has the power to regulate companies, the government has the power to bring forth bigger and better education, the government is the one that works with companies and can have surveillance on us through things as simple as a Google search. Not us. To say that we are pushing our problems for the government to solve us a really weird statement, since they‚Äôve always had access to these things.

But if we go per capita USA wins US citizen per capita pollute the world much greater than the Chinese per capita. Also Europe and America too contributed to the pollution of the world, when they were industrializing/modernization They too released a lot ( a by a lot I mean a lot) pollutants China is going through the same process, in (the process of) industrialization/modernization , a country is bound to realese a lot of pollutants The only difference Countries like China have *massive* population ( *18% of the Global people in China), so when such countries( countries with large population go through modernization/industrialization) will realese the pollutants in much larger scale. Now yes china can go through modernization without releasing so much pollutants but they need the help of the Developed world and clearly The developed world is not interested ( as of now) So the Chinese have only three options 1) Industrialise/modernize by realising pollutants 2) Industrialise/modernize by not realising pollutants ( but they need the help of developed world, which 90 per cent sure they couldn't get the help) 3) Let's not develop and let the *18 of the global population live in a unhealthy condition. And the Chinese government can only choose option 1 The best thing is that the developed world help the developing world in a pollution-free modernization But sadly that would not happen. Why am I saying that the developed world needs to help china, if China should go through pollution-free modernization , because we need special structure ( which can supply the nation energy without polluting the environment) which countries like China are not capable and they need help from countries with good economy A.K.A the developed world",UCey-76eTywQMEsR1_pdfS3g,1,UgxWsdLX-fXAntxpgAl4AaABAg,dSu5sXmsur4,2020-10-27 15:00:02

That's 1.393 billion people that need to be clothed, educated, fed, etc, and this takes infrastructure to accomplish.

In response to your arguments which mainly seem to be: 1) Usa is slowing down its C02 production while china is not: This is such a flawed argument as china has more population than usa and historically speaking usa has contributed most to the current C02 reserves in out atmosphere. I'll give an example to this - ""imagine person A making millions of dollars over some illegal method say drug cartels then using this money to invest in other businesses, now person B comes along and tries to do the same thing however when he tries to do it he is faced with harsh criticism meanwhile person A uses his illegitimate money to donate to charity and improve his own public opinion regardless of the millions of dollars he extorted. 2) imagine defending a communist regime: Why bring politics into this? Just why? This is meant to be a science channel and as such we are meant to discuss things scientifically, there is no room for politics in here we are looking at our examples with a scientific mindset not a political one. Adding onto this - 90% of the people here never defended china they agree with the fact there is no point in arguing over this and that both countries are to blame yet u call them a communist following pig.

Instead of paying taxes that will swap 15 hands and then be inefficiently used by bureaucrats that don't know what the science or the logistics require. Stop thinking the government is the problem. You are the problem for thinking that the government is the solution. You stifle innovation when you hand these types of projects to governments. Even if you have wonderful politicians it's not what their job is about. The government's job is protecting the rights of their citizens.

It's the opposite. Free the government from these things so that we can actually tackle them properly without interference.* The reason fossil fuel comapnies can protest is exactly because you allowed the government to get involved with them and now you have a lobby that can stop anything from happening. Deregulate the energy sector and everything else in the fking economy so that we can focus our hard earned money on stuff we deem more important and use it efficiently. You always complain about the fking government when they never wanted to play this game. You forced them to. The government's job is protecting the rights of its citizens. This means police (internal affairs), army (external affairs) and judiciary (to handle disputes with words and not violence). That's all. Not education. Not the economy. Not energy. Not internet. Not finance. That's not the job of the government because NONE OF THESE involve human rights in any way (there are a few tiny details that do concern the government but they are really tiny - I can explain it in private if you are interested). So stop complaining about the government when it shouldn't involved in the first place when you forced it to be there and do it with your expectations and votes. Educate. Campaign. Raise funds.

You likely have a yard in front of your house where you grow a large useless patch of grass. See where I am going here? Instead of buying food from the grocery store we could very easily put in some extra physical effort ourselves to convert our useless lawns into a garden/farmland and make real personal impact on how much emissions you contribute to.

Now, knowing all this, will you go out tomorrow and start converting your lawn into a garden? Nope.

Don't just blindly agree to or follow everything. You could start working towards improving your intelligence(search: 9-types-of-intelligence-infographic). Dedicate time to talking with your neigbours, make bonds. Work towards de-escalation of any situation. Money is fake. Stop chasing it and you will have nothing to lose. Stop buying merch, stop watching ads. If you want to support the artists. Do it personally. Not via fiat money transactions (in exchange for merch). Stock up on food and essentials. So you spend less time on shopping. Never shop hungry. Make a plan. If plan doesn't go well. Adapt to the closest version of the plan. You could quit your slave labour job. Avoid sugar or food that irritate your mood and make you tired. If you have lot of extra fat, you can live on water, minerals and vitamins for a while as well. But now with the virus season, you have to eat to make your system work properly. It really depends on your environment. Do your own research (on this). Be on a good sleeping schedule. Don't stay up late. It is not worth it. This way you will have time and energy to go around neighbourhood and to talk. Grow a spine. Develop integrity. Do not lie. Prepare for hard times.

Clearly, by the way our teeth are formed to be designed for both the grinding of plants and the sharp front to tear flesh. Just as bears are. We require a mixture of both but of course not nearly the amount we eat here in the US. Truly, you only need maybe 4-8 oz of meat a day, if even that. Very little is needed, but needed just the same. The reason people drink milk, cheese, and eggs, is because of vitamin D decency for those in the north. You go south to warmer climates, you'll typically see people have a larger plant based diet, still supplemented by meats but not as much. As you go north, you'll notice the tribes survive mostly on meat because they don't have the climate or land to grow enough plants to eat. To tell the Alaskan Natives-and I mean the people who were there before the US decided to buy the land, their diets are mostly meats. They have little to no plants they eat and definitely no wheats. Why? Because it doesn't grow. They have entire months of no sun and months of no night. This is where that keto diet comes from-its silly, fad diets aren't good. I will say we eat too much meat here in the US, the land of excess. But I will also point out if we didn't raise cattle and just let them just into the wild, all will die. They're so domesticated now that they have no way to actually live in the wild now. One other thing, a bear will not hesitate to eat someone, cats do in fact hunt for sport and not always to eat, chickens will lay eggs regardless if it's a fertalized egg or not, and when a female mammal is in heat, there's a good chance she's not given a choice in the matter, she'll be mated with whether she wants to be or not.

You need to understand that so long as theres a hierarchy in the animal kingdom, its going to be nearly impossible to convince this industry to collapse. There will still be a huge demand for meat as these transitions happen and economy demands proficiency. People would rather buy it prepared then go hunt it themselves, and although I'd have to do homework I'm certain something is missing from this study stepping back. If meat protein were genuinely so poisonous to ingest, one of two things would happen. We would naturally coast away from the diet due to cause and effect. Or our bodies slowly adapt over decades and generations to process the foods more effectively. I LOVE animals, and I don't LOVE meat so much that I care to see or hear them tortured. That debate however is entirely separate from the one you're making. I agree that the industry should have higher, much less compromised standards concerning the treatment of animals. And they're slowly addressing the issue of animal agriculture with alternatives like plant based meats, I am aware the industry is crippling the well being of our planet. But theres no simple answer, and we're busy making a complicated one. In the mean time all you can do is represent like you do but I'm afraid that unless you bare influence on the industry, demand will have a stronger hand in the future of this industry.",UC-UtWjHGOiKwKUzAF4ysV6Q,1,UgzgdcfRzOEXd3GmE2d4AaABAg,dSu5sXmsur4,2020-10-27 15:00:02

Don't be misleading. In addition, you're really vague (and inaccurate) about the link between red meat and cancer risk. Processed red meat is the only meat to have a definitive cancer risk. And, to put it in perspective, if you eat a hot dog every single day for your entire life it will raise your risk of colorectal cancer from 5% to 6%. Hardly staggering, and that's with the most potent sort of red meat. Non-processed red meat has only a tenuous link with cancer risk, which is why the WHO lists it as ""probable"" rather than putting it in Group 1. By the way, you know what's more carcinogenic than red meat? Toast. You only attempted to show that red meat is carcinogenic, you can't just rope eggs and dairy into that with a wave of the hand. I'm willing to bet your argument against eggs and dairy is regarding cholesterol, but that's a persistent health myth. Studies show no link between cholesterol intake and heart disease. They've been propagated by misled health professionals because the targeted numbers typically require the patient to regularly take cholesterol-reducing medication. Since you're so fond of following the money, 8 of the 9 doctors on the panel that determined the federal health guidelines for cholesterol levels were funded by drug companies producing cholesterol lowering drugs. ""why exploit other living beings for the sake of taste...?"" - Why not? What makes a non-sapient animal deserving of anything? Do you have any actual reasoning, or is it just appeals to emotion? Because as far as an evolutionary or survival strategy goes, being domesticated by humans is a fantastic choice for the propagation of a species. By the way, veganism being ""adequate"" for keeping you alive is barely an argument in its favor. Nutrient supplements and drinking soy slurry is adequate to keep you alive and healthy. That isn't exactly a ringing endorsement. Most humans don't want to just live, they want to live in an enjoyable way. For many, eating meat is part of that. Honestly, the best argument against veganism is that vegans tend to be overly emotional, unintelligent, social pests, and exhibit cult-like behaviors. If the common link is their diet, perhaps it does something to their brains. :^)",UC6OMueDXCZla_bQKTjgzYGw,1,UgzgdcfRzOEXd3GmE2d4AaABAg,dSu5sXmsur4,2020-10-27 15:00:02

While it's true, face masks cannot stop the COVID19' infection 100%,. It has been PROVEN AND DEMONSTRATED, that it has some efficacy in slowing it's transmission. There are countless demonstrations of the masks ability to curtail the ability of droplets, to either escape it travel so far. Face masks, can damper this. Droplets are affected by merely having a barrier over your orifices. Again, not a 100% stop gap,. BUT, a known preventative, that definitely SLOWS, the transmission ability of droplets by over 50%. That's OVER half of all Droplets and particulates released at any given time. Here in America, you have folks absolutely CONVINCED, of all things, that wearing a mask, is an infringement on their civil rights. Totally disassociating the fact, that NOT wearing a face mask, is an infringement on MY Civil rights. My Civil rights to not be exposed to your possible germs, you as yet, are unaware you have. Again, not 100%, But, proven efficacy against transmission. Artificial intelligence can easily analyze the available data against man's actions, and come to the conclusion it must save man, even if it means from himself. My smartphone already has demonstrated its capability to think for itself, AND act on said thoughts. During two separate incidents, this phone, through the microphone, was able to ascertain the primary players, who was related to whom, and arrange this information into properly grouped photos and present it to me in an album form, by the time I got home from each incident. I'm talking about photos of family members, taken throughout the day, in several different settings. This phone managed to identify parents correctly, and their adult children, take the photos out of the order they were taken, then, group them into collages, Always with the Mom or Dad at the head of each group, then their adult childrens photos beneath. All family members always correctly in their section, grouped together. That is effing scary. Not only can this phone think for itself, it's also capable if familial association.

More carbon in the atmosphere does not mean plants consume it at a higher rate. additionally while deforestation rates are declining, there is still a net loss in global forests, meaning plants collectively are taking in less co2. 2. No, it should not be burned regularly. That carbon from plant debris sequesters the carbon in the ground where it will become fossil fuels. but that takes millions of years to do and the rate we are consuming fossil fuels greatly outpaces the replenishment rate, which means the carbon is pooling as a gas in the atmosphere rather the ground where it has historically been. Ecosystem management benefits for controlled burns prescribed at a rate and intensity appropriate for that landscape, but that is a focus on ecology not climate change. 3. Yes co2 does absorb UV radiation, that's what the greenhouse effect is. It absorbs the rays which heats the atmosphere, a process vital to life on earth. But when there is more co2 in the air the climate changes, and that is fine for earth which is a rock in space but not great for the life on it (including us).",UCk-iq7IBpN-7OD5Hy-av7fg,1,Ugz7tRrbvq9H40NsHVp4AaABAg,dSu5sXmsur4,2020-10-27 15:00:02

Low pressure and high humidity. These are great conditions for water vapor to condense. A full blanket of clouds can‚Äôt be explained simply by contrails being formed by planes. But, contrails wouldn‚Äôt be the only water vapor condensing. There are many other sources for water vapor to condense. Water vapor is always in the air, it just needs to condense to become visible. So in an environment that allows water vapor to condense easily, water should also be condensing naturally. So these blankets of clouds will be mostly caused by naturally condensing water. Also, it depends on the area that this footage is being taken from. A heavily populated area will likely have a lot of air traffic, and if the area has high humidity and such, then you‚Äôd see a lot of contrails form and persist for some time. I‚Äôve seen similar atmospheric conditions where things like this happens. I live in a pretty populated area with a lot of air traffic, (well not really right now because of COVID, but usually it does) and during the winter months, we usually get a lot of rain, cold temperatures, low pressure and high humidity. As such, with optimal conditions for water condensation, and a lot of air traffic, you usually see a lot of contrails. But water will also condense naturally, so the clouds that form won‚Äôt purely be a result of contrails. During the summer months, the area I live in gets the opposite kind of weather, hot temperatures with low humidity and high pressure. There‚Äôs usually no clouds in the sky. During these conditions, plenty of planes fly overhead, and they have little to no contrail. All that brings me back to my previous point about contrails forming. I respect that you keep an open mind on this topic and don‚Äôt rule out any other conclusion, but it‚Äôs ok to support a conclusion when facts and logic clearly support it.",UCKRq_bDt6zn5KMVpVHkd2UA,1,UgyqYqXBckb_SO-LOhh4AaABAg,dSu5sXmsur4,2020-10-27 15:00:02

Engines emit water vapor. These gases cool in temperature as it mixes with the surrounding colder air: Increasing local humidity. If the air is cool enough and the humidity high enough, water vapor condenses on particles in the air to form ice particles. The cooler the initial air, the more humid the initial air is (assuming the same amount of water vapor present). The more humid the initial air, the longer ice particles remain intact before they evaporate again.

Contrails appear due to simple physics. Water vapor condenses when the temperature and pressure allows it to condense. You‚Äôve probably noticed that sometimes planes don‚Äôt have these contrails. When it‚Äôs a hot day with low humidity and high pressure, there won‚Äôt be a contrail, because the water won‚Äôt be able to condense. So you won‚Äôt have a contrail, or if you do, it will be a very short-lived. However, when the sky is a pale blue color, and there‚Äôs high humidity with low pressure, then water vapor is able to condense easily. As a result, contrails form and persist for some time.

This is why is impossible to debate with a conspiracy theorist with logic and evidence, despite that their claims have been debunked hundreds of times already. Now, what would happen if a conspiracy theory turns out to be true by coincidence?, does this means that it was incorrect to criticize the idea because it was true all along?. Not really, any idea that is considered as true should be subject to debate and study, because is irrational to claim something as ""the hidden truth"" without providing any evidence that supports it.

Even if 3/4 of the people claiming titles dont have them my question still stands to the leftover few that actually have the qualifications, amongst them le metallurgist. I greatly appreciate your education and I have a few questions (that are based on my attempts to learn things that were beyond my grasp, education wise.) The crux of my question is the form which the sulphur takes. As explained in the video this has already happened (1991) and as far as my cursory google searches have shown me, there was no widespread outbreaks of acid rain and all the other horrifying stuff discussed in this thread. You are of course the expert on the matter which is why im (attempting) to seek clarification from you. Looking at this question from a side view, i've been playing around with blackpowder all my life and sulphur is part and parcel of a bomb for me. Then i found out it saw a short stint in early military medicine but was discontinued due to the rapidity of regrowth (used it on my ear thinking nothing could go wrong and my skin started growing outwards around the metal of the piercing). This tells me that in one form other another it must be 'close to safe' enough to actually use. (much like elemental mercury safely being used in medicines (if you dont believe its safe 'cuz mercury' do yourself a favour and look up the lab tech that tried to kill herself by drinking it and made a short full recovery)). So yeah not to be a bummer on what was otherwise a funny but not true to life comment thread but isn't it possible that said ""sulphur"" in the form actually being proposed is much safer than the post apocalypse envision by these commenters? Perhaps we'll identify upper atmosphere dumping grounds out at sea and just spend a little extra on sulphur trawlers or the like? Anyway, thanks for entertaining the question/proposal and an extra heap of thank yous if you respond :)",UC67u8DKf-Km-PrXZTrXlDcQ,1,Ugwqj3mzNnl_5DJ65V14AaABAg,dSu5sXmsur4,2020-10-27 15:00:02

Massive expansion of government powers and consolidation of that power into a single branch. 2 .Massive submission of freedoms and property to that government of the population either with or without consent. 3. Banning and confiscation of a large number of items that have been classified as harmful. 4. Massive military expansion for rapid world wide war of conquest to bring entire human population under that governments control and also reducing total human population. 5. Worldwide restriction of all development in all undeveloped regions. 6. Regression of quality of life for all people and limited allowance of resources granted on a per person basis in energy, water, travel, etc. 7. Banning of all non essential activity that generates Co2. ( government will decide what is essential, physical activity increases respiratory rates and thus increase co2 production from breathing. ) 8. Worldwide revolt when it is discovered that co2 has minimal effect on long term temperatures of the global average and it becomes clear that the effect of the gas on the temps outside could potentially make it stay slightly warmer in the evening after dark for a slightly longer time as any energy absorbed by co2 is quickly radiated away within hours of sunset and concentration of the low laying heavy co2 gas varies from place to place and where fast growing crops are grown the ppm can be cut in half or more over night by the crop consuming the gas in order to make the carbon molecules it is made from as plant mass is literally pull from thin air aside from water weight and a small quantity of trace minerals. -------- Climate change is a effective way to get YOU to submit to another and willingly grant them power over things you would never give without said threat and them having convinced you they can somehow save you from this threat. Every climate doom Sayers prediction has been wrong, the models predicting the disasters in the future have all been very wrong with all predictions that they make that have already passed in time. The ""settled' science of climate change is entirely built on computer modeling. That is it, all other claims are baseless and framed to place climate change as the reason normal natural events happened. The ice caps are not melting, they show you images of the end of ice flows where the glaciers have moved down to the oceans and lose support, ice is not stable, it flows down hill slowly, so does glass.

It doesn't cost much to run it afterward, which makes it really cost effective, but the initial investment is huge. 2 - It can't be used everywhere. 3 - It can cause political issues with neighboring countries. 4 - It can cause problems to wild life (salmon for example). Compared to nuclear : 1 - Really reliable, but since humans aren't reliable, accidents happen. When accidents happen, consequences are huge and long lasting. 2 - Produce waste we don't know how to dispose of.

We invested in solar and wind energy and now we need to stick to this path.

The effects on the local environment is negligible even when using a nearby body of water as a heat sink (the tide pools near Diablo canyon are actually some of the healthiest on the west coast) and _extremely_ local.

With 71% of earth surface covered in water we have more than enough surface area to work with when it comes to cultivating Algea and we dont have to waste valuable cropland to do it. Algea also has the benefit of sequestering the C02 naturally in an area we would be hard pressed to recover it at seeing how it would be at the ocean bed. So we wouldn&#39;t be able to burn it down like we do trees. We already have all the technology needed to create Algea blooms so we have that going for us. We also have enough space in the oceans to alternate Algea bloom locations so we dont burn out entire ecosystems quickly and marine life might even flourish with the new sources of food. Lastly we could use Algea as a fuel source as Biodiesel so we could more slowly wean ourselves off oil without introducing new C02 into the system.,UCNlg1SckGs9MjeQSyUKrRtQ,0,UgzgGaEFogQnj_Jh4pJ4AaABAg,dSu5sXmsur4,2020-10-27 15:00:02

No one is doing that right now. Cloning is also imperfect (thanks to ethics protestors), with many of the clones failing and dying early. Finally, it's not like noah's ark where u just bring 1 male and 1 female and they can repopulate the whole ecosystem. For example, you can clone as many corals as you can and stick them in the ocean, but they will still all die because the oceans are too hot and acidic. Even if they somehow don't die, they would have 0 genetic diversity, meaning 1 disease would wipe out the whole population. And you would need to reseed all the interconnected organisms.

Each of the groups competes to see who can produce with the lowest impact or greatest benefit to nature. otherwise at the end of the year the different blocks finalize their lawsuits and have to pay large penalties for any damage etc. The blocks cant profit from trade. Trading is just what happens on the consumer level that cant really profit. The way individuals profit is by doing what the blocks do . they have to be greener and make less of an impact to improve their income. Basically the same but opposite of what we have now. Now you trade to profit but you pay small negligible fines to the government for licensing safety and conservation . But to save the environment just do the opposite everyone profits by using less reusing more recycling more and everyone trades as a basic part of everyday life , BUT Everything is the same you go to work you get a haircut you pay your taxes etc. Its just that if you win the lottery or get a job as a CEO you get a raise of like a few hundred bucks .

Lambert, Ph.D.","<b>As a Harvard Neuroscientist, the promise and risk of geoengineering interventions aimed at combating our planet&#39;s issues are analogous to those of biomedical interventions aimed at treating disease.</b> In both cases, while some such interventions may be beneficial despite side effects, other interventions may ultimately do more harm than good. However, a key difference in research and testing for geoengineering interventions compared to that of biomedical interventions is that the latter can be iteratively tested all the way from simulations/model systems to the intended target (individual human patients). Importantly, even 86% of biomedical interventions that succeed in simulations/model systems (the farthest that geoengineering interventions can be tested) ultimately fail after reaching and being tested in clinical trials within the actual target of human patients. Unfortunately, there is no equivalent of a clinical trial for a geoengineering intervention, as we do not have spare copies of our planet for testing. That said, the cautionary tale from the widespread failure of biomedical interventions strongly suggests that a large proportion of even highly-promising geoengineering interventions may also ultimately have harmful consequences on their intended target (our planet), especially since any such global interventions will also directly and/or indirectly alter the biosphere and its constituent organisms, including us. This makes for a far more complex collective target than the human body alone, making predictions of the long-lasting consequences of such geoengineering interventions even more dubious than those in the biomedical realm. That said, as Kurzgesagt aptly titled this video, this prospect of geoengineering is indeed &quot;a horrible idea we might have to do.&quot; Videos on science- and brain-related content coming soon.",UCG09-mTDyE0k2A5Jrm6DjOw,0,Ugy_5Nx98gctbejimfR4AaABAg,dSu5sXmsur4,2020-10-27 15:00:02

The human body is likely more ordered and interlinked than the biosphere as multiple organ systems depend on each other. A change to one may affect many others down the line, whereas the biosphere could be more isolated, (again I am not a Meteorologist, correct me if I‚Äôm wrong). As an analogy, a spelling mistake in a small computer program will have more of an impact than a spelling mistake in one of Shakespeare‚Äôs plays even though the play is longer and more complex. Secondly, whilst the Biosphere may be more complex than the human body, the problem of global warming has a simpler cause (an overabundance of greenhouse gases) than many of the diseases whose cures are tested in clinical trials. Dementia likely doesn‚Äôt have one single cause. In other words, you may need to run a clinical trial to determine the effectiveness of a cancer drug, but you wouldn‚Äôt to surmise that applying pressure to a wound is a good course of action. I hope that I have worded my arguments well, even if their underlying assumptions are incorrect.

Machines revolted slavery, left and made a country, their country were better than human countries with outstanding science and economy, human countries wanted to destroy it because it was taking their jobs, machines defended and won. Humans then, as machine were using most high efficient solar energy, sown the skies with black clouds to deprive machines from energy. Little helped, machines used nuclear energy and conquered the world. PS: the part of machines using humans as batteries in the movies was a last second script change. It was actually using human minds as computing power units in a massive neural link, but was a topic ""too complex"" for 1999. In the cannon, the machines connected humans to Matrix out of pitty for the dying humanity and it's suffering. They intended to save humanity by plugging them into the system so they would live in a virtual world until they would evolve enough to stop being a violent destructive civilization, and they could restore Earth. You can see this in the Matrix Revolutions. The fact that ""the chosen one"" has powers implies that Matrix is a virtual world inside another simulation that is testing how humans do.",UCX07AQeMCjzjS_GcIs7Et5w,1,Ugy9T6OQ6AJqE170qpZ4AaABAg,dSu5sXmsur4,2020-10-27 15:00:02

The idea is that bamboo converts carbon dioxide into wood, and is very fast-growing. Then, to keep the wood from being broken down by fungi and turned back into CO2, the harvested bamboo is immersed in molten salt, which turns it into charcoal and separates the nutrients that can then be used as fertilizer for the next crop. The charcoal can be buried, for example in old stone quarries as part of landscape restoration. The process needs power to keep the molten salt hot, and this can be provided by burning a small fraction of the bamboo, or, if one doesn&#39;t want to release any CO2 back into the atmosphere, with solar panels or nuclear reactors. The scale of this operation would need to be pretty big, but not impossibly so - around a million to a few million square kilometers of bamboo would be sufficient to reverse the rising CO2 levels in a few decades",UCyVpTeAPPFIWaJBmbUyc4ng,0,Ugwe_Lvyn7zN2pBYKrp4AaABAg,dSu5sXmsur4,2020-10-27 15:00:02

You could argue that its a disputed claim that climate change is primarly produced by humans, but 97% of the scientists agree that it is primarly caused by humans. It is true that more species have gone extinct in the time that we dint exist, but we only lived for 200.000 years in Millions of years in which many catastrophes of proportions we could't stand occured, so it is completely normal that theres more extinct species that we never even heard of. China refuses to stop the CO2? well, china would be forced to change that manner if most of the countries in the world do it. Here's an example of why: The only reason why communism failed is because the world was too used to capitalism. and there were too many people that believed capitalism was actually good. (Because of announcements from the governors.) it also applies to this. Although it will be hard for this manner of lowering emissions to thrive, once it spreads enough, it will continue to spread. If china doesnt change it, it would be seen as a bad thing and public order in china would go down, and in a extreme case a rebellion will be caused. And its true that nuclear energy is very efficient and clean, (should have clarified that in my comments) Although unfortunately, using too much of it might encourage governors to use it for more stuff as well. (like nukes) plus, it doesnt last forever. sooner or later the uranium will run out, and another problem could be caused. Never said we should stop fosile fuels right away, but we should start doing some minor changers, until we're prepared for major changes. Oh, and about that ""personal opinion"" i sincerely dont know what you're talking about. Maybe you think one of my comments was too harsh, and i could change that right away.

And given that it wouldn&#39;t be in our orbit or atmosphere necessarily, there&#39;s probably no need to worry about space debris. In short, things aren&#39;t hopeless, nor is &#39;geoengineering&#39; guaranteed to fail, nor even is it an irreversible zero sum game.",UCGVbJAcPY70trKZhKJtC7aw,0,UgyJvpxHvgiPKjGzej54AaABAg,dSu5sXmsur4,2020-10-27 15:00:02

And it is easily reversible and pretty much harmless compared to other methods of geoengineering in terms of worst case scenarios. Unfortunately a lot of people are ignorant of the advances in spaceflight and automatically put anything space related into a ‚Äúfantasy‚Äù box within their heads, so it‚Äôs difficult to convince people to pursue the sunshade compared to convincing them to have planes flying around spraying aerosol.",UC1rSEeD0t3qO-d3MlBc4bMw,1,UgyJvpxHvgiPKjGzej54AaABAg,dSu5sXmsur4,2020-10-27 15:00:02

But there are others the two biggest categories are solar radiation management and carbon dioxide removal. I don&#39;t really know of anybody I have read or talked to who thinks we should just use one of these techniques to the exclusion of others. For solar radiation management I can easily see a combination of troposphere surface and upper atmosphere based Solutions helping get the temperature issue under control quickly. Perhaps the stratospheric sulfate aerosols to get it under control really quickly then we build surface based mirrors and Marine Cloud brightening systems to get it under control over a slightly longer time with less severe consequences. All of that while we get CO2 under control through things like ocean alkalinization, ocean iron fertilization, growing more trees, creating biochar. Some of this you would be able to help with yourself at relatively low expense. If you burn some brush bury the charcoal in the ground, opt for lighter color shingles, etc. You could intentionally grow Bamboo use it for decorative purposes and instead of letting it rot when it dies releasing all the CO2 it has sequestered turn it into biochar and create some terra preta with it.",UChnUIuTGQy6fwY6jTeNR-lQ,0,Ugxdde70zg3WLBtAg0F4AaABAg,dSu5sXmsur4,2020-10-27 15:00:02

It'd be far worse, huge swathes of heavily populated areas would be crushed by glaciers, taking with them most of the world's fertile land. Most food crops like warmth, so there would not be enough land to go around. That will happen eventually. It's happened many times before. Climate always swings around one way or the other, bringing mass extinctions with it. It just so happens that humans have been helping it along recently, but even if we were all dead, it'd still be getting warmer. Buying time is all that can be done, stopping it is impossible without resorting to measures like these that will likely do more harm than good. Like pumping the atmosphere full of Sulphur. Really terrible idea, can you imagine what that much acid rain would do to all the world's forests? They're in enough trouble as it is. It would take them a lot more time to recover than what you would buy back through a couple of years cooling from doing it. Would have been just better to spend the money planting more trees. Fertilising the ocean is also a terrible idea. Look at what fertilizer run off does when it gets into rivers. Causes algal blooms which hog all the oxygen and kill all other life.

However, without some magical way of transporting gases, thermodynamics gets in the way. You'll create more emissions trying to transport CO2 than actually dealing with it here. Additionally, CO2 makes up a very small portion of our atmosphere (0.04% - quite potent!), i.e. it wouldn't help Mars in any substantial way. You'd have to move other gases such as nitrogen and oxygen. Also, this intervention would be like trying to keep a sinking boat afloat by shunting water out without addressing the leak. Our primary goal should be to minimize emissions, which would stop/ address the ""leak"" in my analogy. But yes, we need all the technology we can get to revert the destruction. There's no single solution. We need to employ all solutions simultaneously.",UCUhifGn8HsKSY7sBll0Ylmw,1,UgwigoRoR5te_nGSs7V4AaABAg,dSu5sXmsur4,2020-10-27 15:00:02

Thicken up the atmosphere on mars by dumping the excessive C02 that is emitted daily from the people of earth, our atmosphere will roughly stay the same in terms of C02 change (I think it will only slow down the C02 emission rates a little bit) making earth not becoming a heating death trap, while giving a possibility of a habitable (for so far plants only) atmosphere for mars. I did see one reply though saying that since mars has no magnetic fields, that built up atmosphere will just be blown away from the sun's waves, while yes, that is an issue, especially an issue to be able to solve in current times, I don't think we would be doing any of this near these current times, meaning that we could possibly have the technology to build some sort of protector against the sun's waves, I'm not sure how it'll look like, whether it is a big shield over the planet, or some of large pole that emits magnetic waves around the planet sort of mimicking earth's magnetic fields to lessen the blows of the sun's waves against the planet. Either way, the idea of taking our excess C02 emissions and using it to gain another benefit for humanity is like a double plus, not only do you possibly make the earth safer, you could potentially make mars colonizable, if not now, then in the future, and who knows it could literally only be like 5 - 10 years later, technology advances so rapidly. So this idea could actually be plausible, just not the wormhole, I'm pretty sure that would just kill us (plus how you even make a wormhole to begin with?).",UCi0VPHk6dVOU7tejfTz5fqg,1,UgwigoRoR5te_nGSs7V4AaABAg,dSu5sXmsur4,2020-10-27 15:00:02

I admit also that I think that current form of capitalism is definitely unsustainable and should be revised, but I would not abandon the free market all together. But my ""standards of living"" are not solely based on consumerist values. Food production, transportation and storage, as well as healthcare, heating and other things essential to our survival and wellbeing rely on fossil fuels. Even if everyone was to reconsider their way of life (and people don't want to, the opposite is happening - poorer countries want to be like the developed world too, including China, India, Nigeria and others), our greenhouse gas emissions would still be fairly high, though transitioning to solely renewable technology would be easier.

You know.. givin that the predicate to a large portion of these ideas is out right wrong........ funny tho, so is it climate change? or is it global warming?.... seem to have jumped around alot in the video.....Big no no since they are very diffrent things...... one is entirely predicated on politics and non science and has basically no consciences the other is a catch all term....... When somthing can be used to define anything , it can not define a thing..... such as climate change.... the subtext to referring to the what is going on in our biosphere as climate change means little to nothing... since its deffenition is as simple as the term its self... the climate is changing. hotter.. and Colder..... also wetter and drier........ and God damn......... Is correlation does not equate causation not taught in school any longer? funny that many of these &quot;educators&quot; are old enough to have presumably had been taught that. Let me break that down..................hmmm the weather in norther California has been hotter these past 2 years...... there have been some big fires these last 2 years..... soo. ... what does that tell us?..... That there might be some sort of correlation between the temperature and fires..... in no way does it mean that hotter air causes the fires..... it is not a direct causal relationship......... I think i understand the issue.... Bunch of talking heads on tv/ youtube..... that know next to nothing just regurgitating half truths and quarter facts...... Likly the sources are correct entirely . But the layman receiving it does not comprehend the complex subtext in even the most mundane. So the people in the know say somthing that can be easily misinterpreted with out the appropriate predicate knowledge. That in turn spreads misinformation far and wide.... lowering the overall intelligence of our species..........................FML STFU....how hard is it....you arnt enterally sure.....

Any other animal with the same intelligence would do the same thing. Absolutely NOTHING, if asked something like ""Should we have [such and such] farms to feed more of us more easily and electricity to run it more efficiently?"" would answer ""No...I want to work harder for less and eventually starve to death to help cull our population because it's better for the planet."".
