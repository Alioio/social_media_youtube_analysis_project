I find it curious that only Brazil has a bad reputation for destroying forests, but if forest fires are occurring all over the world, maybe this happens because of, I don&#39;t known, global warming! And who are the main causers of this warming? USA and Europe, in the last centuries they destroyed most of their forests and with their factories, automobiles and thermoelectric plants, they&#39;ve been emitting millions or billions tons of CO2 into the atmosphere, why their media doesn&#39;t talk about that? I think that the hypocritical governments and media of the major western countries are manipulating people to think that the emerging contries and specially Brazil are the major deforesters of the world.

The Amazon rainforest in Brazil is being destroyed to make way for the production of soybeans, in which 80% is food for slaughter animals, which is extremely profitable due to our demand for meat. We well know that we don&#39;t need animal protein to survive. We consume animals just to satisfy our taste, just for pleasure, which is ethically wrong. We are the only species on the planet that destroys it. The best way to help save the Amazon, eliminate animal suffering, preserve the environment, and contribute to reducing global warming, is to switch to a plant-based diet, which is sustainable, contributes to eliminating the hunger in the world, in addition to being the ideal diet for our health.

(3) growing plants to feed to animals to then feed to humans rather than eating the plants directly is a massive waste of energy, water, land, and food, and world hunger could be significantly lessened since 82% of people who are starving live in countries where food is grown to feed animals for meat in western countries. (4) torturing, mutilating and killing billions of sentient beings each year just to eat their flesh when we don't need it to survive is something that objectively shouldn't exist in a better future. etc etc. there are many many reasons we need to end animal agriculture, the future of humanity and the planet depend on it.

I am quite sure that these fires were criminal. I want foreigners to understand and not accuse us of being irresponsible, etc. Our country and our population do not accept in any way that deforestation continues, but it is very difficult to inspect the entire Amazon, after all it is gigantic.

Much of the deforestation is families making a living to feed their kids.

This video is VERY political, very poor on facts and the graphics are extremely exaggerated.

I promise you there&#39;s much more to that :) Or can I just say, buying their way into the land to extract minerals without regulation? And guess who they gave the money to? Yes.. previous governments.... Easy to stop deforestation by creating laws and changing numbers but allowing companies to extract in exchange for money right?!?!?!<br />BTW the previous Presidents Lula, Dilma, and Temer that they just showed on the video were in jail, are still a defendant for corruption scandals. <br /><br />I can say that the international pressure over the Amazon is not to protect the forest. Countries that destroy and used most of their own resources are now pointing the finger to Brazil, which preserves more than 60% of its natural forestation. I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s because of the fires of 2019. Yes, the fires DID happen but it was very small compared to the other years (go search) and are illegal, done by criminals. People are being investigated and the military stopped the fires. But the big media and powerful countries are making this a big thing because of Brazil&#39;s current government. This government is now taxing, stoping and making laws to stop international companies that used to STEAL natural resources from the Amazon through corruption. <br />Brazil is the most interested in protecting our nature BUT growing the economy at the same time, giving space, for example, to native Brazilians that want to work on their land.<br /><br />Yes, there is MUCH to be done and to be protected, but PLEASE go search for the real stuff! :) I&#39;m Brazilian and VERY proud of our Amazon.",UCT3dwDqDV1E4EHpR5rFXdjQ,0,UgwZY_nsX5H57yEdObt4AaABAg,SAZAKPUQMw0,2019-11-21 13:00:07

Instead of questioning the logic of his greed. Perhaps one should question the need for the consumption of meat. The lack of a need will end deforestation. A lot of politicians and environmentalists, will preach about saving the planet, adhering to public sentiment for votes and funding, only to use that very same resource of money and influence to perpetuate the problem. To perpetuate an image of a civilized person. Eating well. <br /><br />So the problem isn‚Äôt seen in the conclusion of an act (deforestation).

At that time the Amazon &quot;Rainforest&quot; began to erupt from the abandoned and neglected basin lands, like weeds take over an untended garden. The &quot;Rainforest&quot; did not exist prior to that time. Just as abandoning all the land in Nebraska today would cause the return of much of the pre-1800 Prairie. The changeover (not destruction) of the &quot;Rainforest,&quot; and the return to an intensively farmed culture will have little or no deleterious effects on People or the Planet.

But as a Brazilian I must say that the rest of the world should also do their part. Yes we shold save the rainforest but consider that 62% of Brazils landmass is forested while only 33% of United States, 29% of france&#39;s and 11% of the UKs ladmass is forested. Why should Brazil be held responsible for these countries oxigen. There could be an international law that forces each country to have a certain amount of their arable land as forested but obviously it will never pass as the countries most affected are the most ppowerful ones. What about a tax for every country that has less than a certain amount of native forest which is payed for the relative amount of forest other countries have because even though it is important to save the rainforest it is always land that not only is not profitting the country but coming as an expense. Unfortunately I only see blame beaing thrown at Brazil without looking at their own countries. Lets rememmber that a great part of Europe and North America was also forested at one point. Unfortunately they cut all their trees down and instead of facing up with their mistakes and responsibilities it is easier to put the blame on one country.

This likely means a lot of subsidies and needs to be well regulated so it does not created unintended effects. Of course I do believe that the negative externalities offset any benefits these farmers and ranchers gain as a whole. But it externalities so they do not pay for it. They just benefit from the positive side. But if we can bring this burden over to ranchers and farmers as well as opening up new opportunities then maybe we can create a more sustainable way to stop this. <br /><br /><br /><br />Of course a very ridged mindset that some of these farms and ranchers have it may be had to make them change there ways even if you offer them a better opportunity with the other hand. Simply because some people just hate to change. And that sadly sometimes requires a generational shift, which we do not really have the time of waiting for.

In spite of a clearly flawed argument, I can understand his motivations. You need to understand that this man has probably gone from a worker living in misery to a proud landowner. And that is the reality that was forgotten in this video. <br />Even though the policies implemented in the beginning of the 2000s helped reduce considerably the deforestation, they did close to nothing to address the social calamity that is seen in the North of Brazil, the poorest in the country. The so called sustainable exploration of the forest may be ecologically sustainable, but it is far from being socially and economically viable. On top of that, the current Venezuelan crisis has further deteriorated the position of these states by bringing a humanitarian crisis to the border of Brazil.<br />That being said, I could never say that what this administration is proposing for the economic development is a solution if any kind. It implies ignoring the progress that has been done until now and going back to an unsustainable system. However, one cannot believe that simply going back to the systems previously implemented will solve the problem.

I'm not saying this to demonize atheism. I don't believe atheism is anymore dangerous than any other ideology. My point is that ideology will always be twisted, and excluding a three letter word won't change that. Whether your worship is god, country, progress, what have you, so long as it's a mildly intangible concept with flexible definition it will be twisted to stand for what the speaker wants it to stand for. The important thing to address here is greed at the expense of others, not the veils people will place over it to pretty it up. That would just be falling for a trap, attacking people's beliefs and provoking a defensive reaction, which is exactly what people using religion as a shield are often looking for. Suddenly tons of people are rushing to defend something that would otherwise be entirely unrelated to their faith were it not for the greedy artificially tying it to their goals, and critics of that greed echoing that tie by treating the two as one. An artificial army stands unknowingly at the ready as the conversation is allowed to change, and the greed continues unabated on the sidelines.",UCwnegY35QuVOQGmw3u-6lyQ,1,Ugxv5hO8EW62gKdkgK14AaABAg,SAZAKPUQMw0,2019-11-21 13:00:07

The thing is that if you put too much people protecting those areas, you end up corrupting aboriginal lifestyle and culture. Its a big dilema. You also have to take in account that some areas in eastern amazon, from bolivia to sao luis, were completely integrated into brazilian state with all its logistics and wealth distribution and demands, while western amazon its basically populated by aboriginal and drug dealers. More, 40% of brazilian workforce is informal, due to extreme burocracy created by previous governements influenced by paris legislators. Finally, last year Evo Morales legalized fire on bolivian forests, and that created a mess on the border, that goes back to the time when the political decision forced the border areas to stay untouched.

The regulations and laws passed in order to protect the rainforest, which Vox presented in a nice way, is a good way to force industries to produce more efficiently, but not necessarily at a bigger profit margin. According to Keynes and other economists you can change supply-demand in short terms (others come to power, back to deforestation) but long term is much harder to control. <br />Bj√∏rn Lomborg and others has been saying for years that in order to save the climate, it has to be more profitable than destroying it. So for that to happen there is several things that can be done. One is to pay the farmers more for preserving the rainforest than what they can achieve from destroying and cultivating it.

You can do that from the comfort of your seat but Brazil has a complex history and complicated politics as well as an economy that has been damaged in the past years. Conservatives are not demons that only want profit for themselves (ok many of them are); thing is that if you tax industries too much, then they&#39;ll probably end up closing or finding somewhere cheaper to settle. This means unemployment and less money coming into the national economy. Jobs can be given by the State but if it becomes unsustainable then you have another Venezuela situation where the country runs out of money to print the money to pay for the jobs and services. <br />I would urge the Americans and Europeans watching this video to take a look at the history and development of third world countries after the fall of the Berlin Wall and try to see whether their own countries aren&#39;t responsible in part for the excessive exploitation of natural resources in previously colonized land.

(Depending on what type of good meat) I do agree that they will become more available to the average consumers, but it won't go down as much in reality, and plus it's production line may decrease too due to less consumption from their higher price tags, making it counter-productive to the solution of pricing, and people having better meat.",UC7X659jVboDvLej_sCCE75g,1,UgydHGqSTPCRZL3LFNZ4AaABAg,SAZAKPUQMw0,2019-11-21 13:00:07

But as a Brazilian I must say that the rest of the world should also do their part. Yes we shold save the rainforest but consider that 62% of Brazils landmass is forested while only 33% of United States, 29% of france's and 11% of the UKs ladmass is forested. Why should Brazil be held responsible for these countries oxigen. There could be an international law that forces each country to have a certain amount of their arable land as forested but obviously it will never pass as the countries most affected are the most ppowerful ones. What about a tax for every country that has less than a certain amount of native forest which is payed for the relative amount of forest other countries have because even though it is important to save the rainforest it is always land that not only is not profitting the country but coming as an expense. Unfortunately I only see blame beaing thrown at Brazil without looking at their own countries. Lets rememmber that a great part of Europe and North America was also forested at one point. Unfortunately they cut all their trees down and instead of facing up with their mistakes and responsibilities it is easier to put the blame on one country.

Instead of actually flying to Brazil and seeing it themselves! The restrictions in the Amazon state are applied to the land.. Doesn't matter how u'll b using the land (as shown in the video)!! If u live in the Amazon state, u're only allowed to use 20% of ur land doesn't matter the size, and the remaining 80% must remain untouched (Read ""law n¬∫ 12.651""). It's not like there's ""too many restrictions"" to build anything.. The law simply DOESN'T allow us to!! The worst part is the fact that 88% of the people living in Manaus (That's where i lived) & surrounding towns are DIRECTLY RELATED to the natives.. So they own that land longer than everybody else & yet can't do anything with it. Once there's no companies, the only way they can get around is through farming & selling among themselves (so there's only a minority of farms that are ACTUALLY owned by big corporations.. Most are locals trying to live & eat)... But the government, big media, news outlets, politicians trying to get vote seeing images from the Amazon up in space from 1950sh compared to 2019 says that ""big corp"" are killing the Amazon! While in reality, their lack of investment in basic needs for the locals is what's actually killing the Amazon. U can't just move 5 million people out of their land... But u also can't force them to live like animals to ""preserve"" trees. Can they develop many sustainable cities around the Amazon? YES.. Manaus (the capital) did just that! But Manaus had to cut some trees down for farming, wiring, plumbing, hospitals & schools (basic needs) in the past so it could become what it is today... A model of sustainability to the world where u have both a city & trees (People with sanitation & parks)! But u cant ONLY have trees where u have that many people. It's inhumane and cruel...

But you're missing the point: those trees won't just grow back in 20 years' time. If you deforest the land, it will become as dry as the Sahara. Without trees, no moisture can accumulate and none of the trees can survive there anymore (since Amazon trees rely on high rainfall). The trees right now sustain themselves, but the balance is delicate. Not to mention that species don't come back to the areas that regrow- they stay only in the areas that are untouched. Once you chop those trees down, the animals and plants that lived there are gone forever. Brazil could make billions or trillions of dollars selling medicines taken from the Amazon, but instead Bolsonaro thinks selling the wood is a better option. It's lazy and cheap. Brazil is nothing more than a plantation now. Brazil could be so much richer and keep its forests, but because of corruption it will lose everything.

Brazil could easily fund into research of thorium reactors and start producing companies who specialize in the field. Start to export their trained construction workers and reactor operators to other countries and ultimately change their economy and the world for the better. Poor countries don't need to deplete their natural resources to improve their economy especially in the modern world. Brazil has very smart people, I'm sure they will find something more sustainable for the environment that benefits their economy more than agriculture.",UC8Rj0AxHk6ZVp2lLJ11HAkA,1,Ugy1P1Gp6f2uREBf6s54AaABAg,SAZAKPUQMw0,2019-11-21 13:00:07

Everything in this universe is bound to the natural laws from which everything emerges. And you can rest easy knowing there is no ""either/or"" to the moral implications of any action. There is only ever one complete answer. Morality is just a human way of saying 'universal net positive/universal net negative'. There are objective moral outcomes to actions regarding sentient systems (which also follow the same laws), and their conscious states. And then there are your ""subjective"" interpretations of morality. They only are at this level due to biological and existential conditions, and lack of complete information, or the ability to interpret it. But if, hypothetically, you were suddenly provided all the information in the universe, and were able to compute it. There would only be one ""result"". Of course, you can always continue imagining it as being whatever is comfortable in your current mental state, since you are under no inherent obligation to follow objective morality. And appealing to nature is a logical fallacy you should avoid falling into. It is clear ""we are animals"" only applies on Youtube comments. When you are wronged, you won't just take it like an animal. You'll go to the arbitrary ""law"", and ask for the arbitrary ""justice"".

The permanent destruction these people are causing yields nothing more than quick profit in the hands of people who are already rich. These farms don't even employ a lot of people since they are highly automated. And if even they didn't the wages paid to farmhands in the Amazon are incredibly low. Not to mention that the North is the region in Brazil where land isn't nearly as fertile as the Midwest or the South, that are the true pillars of Brazillian agriculture. The only thing I think this video doesn't show very clearly is that the creation of pastures for cattle in the Amazon can be even worse than the soybean farms since in the latter the farmer at least takes care of the soil and uses it twice a year.
