It's a natural consequence of men wanting female validation and women wanting shinny garbage. The simple solution to all the garbage and pollution is obvious; stop giving a shit about women and how they feel. Take women's rights away and stop simping. All the garbage is merely a consequence of change female chemistry. Once we gave them all the pill so they can screw who they want without consequences, we really messed it up. Humans are social animals, that means you can change the behavior of one or the group as a whole my changing the hormonal chemistry of one or a few. During pregnancy the male mammal will continuously acquire resources for the female. In humans, we gave the majority of women hormones so their body acts as if they were pregnant. We as humans have abstracted the idea of resources into hyper-reality.... so you get things like shinny cars and iphones and all kinds of garbage. Men don't need that shit, but they want it so they can get social validation, for the mating game. Go your own way. Stop doing things for women and stop spending your money on garbage. That's all we can do.

It says &#39;&#39;Greta, I am also an ardent supporter of environmental protection. We humans are the only species with the power to destroy the earth as we know it. Yet, if we have the capacity to destroy the earth, so too, do we have the capacity to protect it. It is encouraging to see how you have opened the eyes of the world to the urgency to protect our planet - our only home...&#39;&#39; <br /><br />The Dalai Lama said &#39;&#39;Genuine concern from young people is a hopeful sign. Everyone wants happiness, even animals and insects. Humans are trouble makers who think too much of desire and self. In ancient times, our sense of community was small circles of &#39;we&#39; opposed to &#39;them&#39; - of &#39;my nation against your nation&#39;. Now such limited thinking, in small social circles is unrealistic. In today&#39;s world, all 7 billion human beings are one human community. The lives of all of us depend upon each other. The welfare of the whole human community is in the best interests of each individual. [Instead of thinking only of our country as our home] we must think of the whole planet as our home. Oneness of 7 billion human beings.&#39;&#39; <br /><br />Greta said &#39;&#39;Thankyou, D.L. for standing up for the future of humanity, and for life on earth. Thankyou for the support you have given me.&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;There is a huge need for more awareness of what is happening. Most people haven&#39;t heard of &#39;feedback loops&#39;, or &#39;tipping points&#39;, or &#39;chain reactions&#39;, etc. But these things are so crucial to understanding how the world works, and the consequences (effects) of our actions. We humans have such a lack of respect for nature and the environment, and we just expect that things will work out in the end. Our actions will have consequences beyond our current understanding and predictions. Once these things are set in motion, we may not be able to stop them. So, we cannot solve the climate emergency without understanding more about feedback loops. This is crucial. Reducing pollution emissions by only 50% in 10 years, is not enough because this level still risks setting off irreversible chain reactions beyond human control.&#39;&#39; <br /><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9GXgOMMeTg&amp;t=28m08s"">28:08</a> 1st film clip: The emissions from fossil fuel pollution add heat-trapping gasses into the air. This raises the earth&#39;s temperature. Because of this raised temperature, different types of (previously locked up) heat-raising gasses get released from places like forests, and the frozen arctic ground as it thaws out. These now also make the world hotter. This sets in motion a self-perpetuating warming feedback loop. The problem amplifies (keeps increasing). It is a vicious cycle where one type of global warming causes a different type of global warming to be released, and this combination causes yet another type of warming, and so forth. It is a chain reaction that causes the planet to warm up much faster than previously expected. <br /><br />Scientists have identified dozens of feedback loops that are already in motion. Each of them increase global warming, and combined, they are spinning out of control. <br /><br />Su said &#39;&#39;The Arctic has many important feedback loops. For example, the loss of reflective ice and snow is causing the earth to absorb more of the sun&#39;s energy. As a result, the Arctic is warming more than twice as fast as the rest of the planet. Now globally, we are seeing more wild fires, heat waves, floods and drought.&#39;&#39; <br /><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9GXgOMMeTg&amp;t=32m37s"">32:37</a> 2nd film clip: Last summer, Dr Su noticed a lot of melting of permafrost in Alaska, Russia, Tibet and the Arctic tundra. She analyses the carbon in that frozen soil. <br /><br />Su said &#39;&#39;There is 3 times more carbon stored in the permafrost ground than there is every tree, in every forest on the planet. That carbon (in the tiny roots in the soil) has been frozen for thousands of years. As it thaws, microbes break down that decaying organic carbon, and release it into the atmosphere as greenhouse gasses. Those gasses cause warming. That warming, in turn, leads to more thawing, etc. This is called &#39;the permafrost loop&#39;. By the end of this century, permafrost emissions could be equal to current USA pollution emissions. This permafrost loop has not been factored into global carbon assessments. Decision makers should be made aware of it, and take it into account. <br /><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9GXgOMMeTg&amp;t=37m27s"">37:27</a> Bill said &#39;&#39;As the temperatures rise, the metabolism of plants and soil microbes increases. Therefore they store less carbon, and release more CO2 and methane (heat-trapping gasses) into the air. This is an important feedback loop that accelerates global warming. Forests are very good at removing CO2 from the atmosphere. But global warming causes more droughts, pests and huge wildfires. These loops also harm the forests and means more CO2 gets released, resulting in more global warming. <br /><br />Half of all the pollution emissions that have ever been created by humans have occurred since the last climate treaty in 1992. <br /><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9GXgOMMeTg&amp;t=42m00s"">42:00</a> 3rd film clip...",UCS2yFtQgkw2Iv1mg8a3PNcA,0,UgyMTpI1G0cUwX5tZKl4AaABAg,u9GXgOMMeTg,2021-01-10 08:54:08
