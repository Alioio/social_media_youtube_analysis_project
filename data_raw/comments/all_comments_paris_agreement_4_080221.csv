The US and some European countries have recently met their agreement goals and exceed the goals...just about 30% reduction in CO... However, China is at 5 TIMES the CO output than in 1978..due to burning COAL at an all time high... They are burning coal to produce cheap power...this is great for industry and production as well as consumer usage...Ultimately this will increase the China's GNP and GDP...

The problem is that the nationally determined contributions (the commitments) are not. Scientists predict that, even if the countries in the Paris Agreement honor their carbon reduction commitments, the Earth’s temperature will increase by 3 degrees Celsius by the end of century compared to pre-industrial levels. Climatologists have long said that just a 2 degree increase will cause a worldwide catastrophe. The participating countries need to significantly increase their individual carbon reduction efforts.

The agreement doesn’t include a global tax on carbon. If recent history has taught us anything, it’s that fear of global disaster isn’t enough to change people’s behaviour. Money always moves the needle, however. In terms of global warming, that means instituting a global tax on carbon. Without a carbon tax, there is no financial incentive for countries to stop using cheap fossil fuels and transition to more sustainable sources (which means countries will never do it).

There’s no way to punish countries that don’t honor the agreement. One of Donald Trump’s first acts as United States president was to leave the Paris Agreement. The tragedy isn’t that the U.S. will no longer honor the accord (although it is a major setback). The tragedy is that the U.S. was allowed to do it with zero repercussions. The Paris Agreement doesn’t include any punishments for countries that don’t honor their commitments. Countries can continue polluting and burning fossil fuels and emitting CO2 at alarming rates without having to suffer any negative consequences. There is no regulatory body to keep countries accountable and check if they’re meeting their goals. There are no sanctions or monetary fines for countries that don’t. Nothing.

There aren’t enough incentives for investing in sustainability. Research has shown the most effective way to address climate change is to take investment dollars away from companies that harm our planet, and to invest that money in companies that actively promote environment and social sustainability. Unfortunately, the Paris Agreement does little to encourage this redirection of funds.

The agreement gives us false hope. This is perhaps the most sinister aspect of the Paris Agreement. Politicians and industry leaders from around the world have celebrated the agreement as a monumental step toward addressing climate change (ha!). This gives people the false perception the problem is solved and we don’t need to do anything else, which couldn’t be any further from the truth.",0.0,0.0,,Sr2J_1J9w3A,

Remove the atmosphere/GHGs and the earth becomes much like the moon, a 0.1 albedo, 20% more kJ/h, hot^3 on the lit side, cold^3 on the dark. Nikolov, Kramm (U of AK) and UCLA Diviner mission all tacitly agree.

3) the terrestrial surface radiating that ""extra"" energy as a near ideal .95 emissivity black body which

Wind, solar, hydro, nuclear, etc have all been around for a while and have steadily grown as part of the US energy grid over the years.

Instead it's to incentivize renewable and natural gas projects to come online and ""phase out"" non-renewables. 

Notice the term I just used; Biden's been saying it for a while to push back against progressives that would prefer a much faster replacement of existing energy infrastructure. He isn't asking anyone to ""switch in a day"" and is instead looking to make common sense policy decisions.

But you gloss over how that happens. Why? Cost? We don't know @ 3:55. We don't know how much better off we will be @ 3:59. And we don't know how much we need to reduce Co2 to hit target temp. Sounds like an unworkable plan. You folks talk crap about the science behind Climate Change, but when the rubber hits the road, you present us with unknowns. How is that Science Based? Science uses at the very least a guess (theory) about what is needed to get a certain goal. This accord, according to this video does NOT do that. Science plots changes in status of factors involved. This plan does not even gather data about who, what, where, or how carbon or other factors have been or will be reduced. You need that data, to see if the goal is getting closer, or further away. If for example you go with Solar. You still need to factor in the parts used to harness Solar energy. Batteries which store power for later use contain carcinogens which are harmful to both humans and the environment. So, how is that accounted for? Batteries contain Lead, Sulfuric Acid, Lithium, Nickel cadmium, and other harmful elements. For not knowing how much cost, how much temp reduction will happen, or how much carbon to reduce. How can the Climate change cheerleaders know that wind, solar, or whatever else they or pushing is a good solution? The only proven way to reduce carbon safely, is to reduce demand. Reducing demand is as simple as changing out old light bulbs for LED bulbs. Which will benefit the individual user (home owner/shop keep) through lower electricity bills. As it does reduce the amount of electricity needed (demand). You gloss over Farming and how climate change impacts it. But you have ZERO data, about how Farming it self is causing problems to carbon levels. The way we till crops over, every year adds to our carbon footprint. If farmers would just skip the tilling of fields and just cut minimum areas to plant the seeds, then we would have a cover crop year round, that pulls carbon from the environment, instead of  adding more carbon. Some farmers are now planting winter crops that add to their bottom line, and provide protection from spring flood and hail damage. Plus a reduction in the use of fertilizers. The farmers do have the data that suggest that after a few years of No till farming, the soil can hold more water.",2.0,0.0,,Sr2J_1J9w3A,

Also what is great is that China makes up 29% of all CO2 emmissions on planet earth(USA 14%) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_carbon_dioxide_emissions so with this data  the Paris Agreement makes sure China has a chance to catch up to the rest of the world (like letting Lebron just score as many points as he can with no one else on the court for 14 minutes so that his team can have a 60 point lead before the other team is allowed to start blocking hid shots or get any rebounds) and continue digging up coal, burning as much coal as it needs and get those levels up to an even  higher rate since it's only already well above anyone else by a longshot(it's like when Lebron comes on the court all the opposing team players should have one hand tied behind their backs to let Lebron catch up to their level), then in 2030 China can begin their decrease in production of coal, however the USA needs to stop NOW!!!  It's emissions are out of causing= global warming..Not China's)!  I'm so upset Trump didn't sign it so that America would end it's coal production in 2016!  Trump was stupid for not agreeing to this great plan and I'm glad French President Macron said they'll be no changes to it whatsoever! It's a great plan that stops the USA from globally warming the planet but makes sure China gases is with enough CO2 to take out the ozone in no time! This was a one time chance for making seriously important changes to the earths CO2 emmisions levels and Trump blew it! Anyone who puts this plan down or says it is a silly agreement that does nothing but help the Chinese destroy earth and that instead it should have the minimal basic level of importance of a trade agreement with penalties if broken, and that we should force all nations to stop or slow down emissions regardless of how big and great their economy is outgrowing every economy on earth  and that the rest of the world needs to quit blaming the USA for the earth's CO2 emissions by forcing them to immediately stop digging coal while China who emits twice as much as the USA gets a 14 year pass on a silly no consequences agreement just doesn't care about our environment and is insulting other world leaders who've agreed on this great Paris Agreement!! Well just because Trump didn't sign it doesn't mean China's going to stop https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal_mining#/media/File:Top_coal_production_countries.svg
Here's a chart of the largest coal producers in the world.  With the great Paris Agreement China will be able to increase their production and catch up for the next 14 years, but Trump said no, he didn't like this agreement and that if China's going to keep going, he wants the USA to keep going as well(such a bad actor this man is)...so the rest of the world leaders all agreed that China does need to increase it's current levels and then in 14 years begin the decrease, but of course with no penalty if China changes it's mind and signed it (Paris Agreement is so awesome!).  The other world leaders should all be applauded for their environmental concern and doing what's best for the environment!! Go China Destroy the world = Paris agreement.

That is the theory, and it does NOT support the alarmist predictions. The actual measurements show that modern warming began in 1910, which was before fossil fuel usage reached levels sufficient to cause a significant rise in CO2 levels. An effect cannot start before its cause. Likewise, Vostok and EPICA ice core measurements show that historically, temperature increases happened before CO2 level increases.

1) Forgetting that the extent to which we currently feed and clothe and house people is vitally dependent on fossil fuels.

2) Oversimplification of the political process and/or value of the Paris Agreement. This is an easy way to discredit the arguments against leaving the Agreement, at *best*; at worst, it is a failure of the pro-climate-response side to take the issue seriously when the anti-climate-response side has been digging trenches for decades.

*Before you comment: I am a huge (but qualified, for other reasons) supporter of the Paris Agreement and I absolutely do not support inaction.* 

3) Social media and YouTube are wonderful for a lot of things and they are the current (if you believe the hype) preferred methods of data retrieval for human beings. This is an inefficient and ineffective method for such large problems as resource dependence and climate change. More needs to be done, and I don't think anyone reading this disagrees, but there is an extent to which these media end up acting as outlet valves for those of us inclined towards change to let off excess steam. And we know where steam goes. YouTube could easily be a force for change, but you would need to convince a lot of people to watch a thoroughly researched 4-hour documentary (for free) on it to move the needle.

Before I go on, the hidden assumption in that must be pointed out. There are many reasons to approve of pulling out. As to Economics, I only have a very simplistic knowledge; If people want something, you can make money giving it to them. If you get very wealthy, it gives you world class authority and power.

I do know a bit more about Thermal Dynamics and Chemistry and some fairly easy Mathematics. Thermal Dynamics is probably the easiest science of all to learn. The best known field of Thermodynamics is water and gas. My current imagineering project is a heat recycling ICE.

Considering my knowledge of Economics and Thermodynamics: In my considered opinion, Civilization Caused, Catastrophic, Global Warming is a money scam bigger than the world has ever seen.

What ""paradigm?"" You think that virtually all scientists and experts from a plethora of disciplines, from every country and society on the planet, have all been bribed to reach the exact same conclusion. In order to be bribed, there must be a briber, some sort of powerful international entity that has some (what?) motive for fabricating a mountain of scientific evidence. That is the quintessential definition of a conspiracy. 

-""darwinists can't accept anamolous findings that challenge Darwinian Theory because their livelihoods and research have banked upon it as though it were an immutble fact.""

Perhaps you are commenting on the wrong video. This is a discussion about climate change, not Darwin's work on natural selection. The two things are entirely unrelated.

-""throughout history religions, governments, and other groups have actively disavowed, hidden things, and discredited individuals and smaller groups who challenge their specific paradigm. Obfuscation comes in mumerous forms, selective filtering, theft of vital evidence, bribery/leverage, repeatedly pushed disinformation, etc.""

In another word, conspiracy. The problem is your conspiracy theory lacks any motive. 

-""what were the specialties of those who concluded the climate change reports? what criteria were considered? How many independent labs/experts were consulted to independently verify the results? How much funding went to each of them? How many rewoked models with different criteria were studied? How many independent groups have successfully repeated their conclusions?""

All of these questions you can easily find answers to yourself. It's all made transparently public. That's how science works. Provide me with an article and I would be easily able to find all of the information you desire on it. This sounds more like intellectual laziness on your part. All of the information is out there, but you haven't bothered to look for it out of fear that it will overwhelmingly conflict with your (likely uninformed/baseless) position on climate change.

-""Who funded the oppositional research? Anyone?""

No one funds ""oppositional research"" unless they have a vested interest in finding evidence to the contrary (e.g. an oil company funding private ""research"" in hopes they will find evidence that carbon emissions are not harmful, which obviously benefits their operations). That's called confirmation bias and is thoroughly unscientific. Genuine scientific research doesn't work that way. Researchers receive funding based on the topic of research, not their conclusions.  

-""Climate change has been a part of the EARTH's entire history (being that planetary climate is static) so exactly how were these conclusive reports ""AGREED TO?""

The earth's climate is always changing. The reason we know this change is anthropogenic is because the current rate is unprecedented (much to fast to be ""natural""), coincides directly to the beginning of human industrialization (the chance of that being a coincidence are infinitesimal), and is being directly caused by carbon forcing and increased carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere, which obviously got there through human emissions and the disruption of the typical carbon sink cycle. 

-""The effects of pollution and man's global involvement/impact is a relatively new ""infant"" topic with nearly incalculable variables.""

Incalculable? Says who? Clearly you are not a scientist of any sort, let alone one related to climatology, so you have no idea what calculable even means. 

""Admitting that there are reasons scientists (and other people) would push a narrative or jump the gun in their conclusions for whatever reason isn't ""CONSPIRACY NONSENSE,"" It's merely PRAGMATIC.""

But as I said before, you haven't given any reasons. Your conspiracy theory lacks explanatory power, so it can't even be called a theory. You just said scientists are getting paid, but a) they would getting paid either way and b) would have to be paid by someone for someone reason. Who? Why?

Do you know why people like yourself bother with these sort of conspiracy theories? It's because you don't understand the science and therefore cannot meaningfully engage with the material supportive of climate change. You cannot read a published article and say ""I disagree with... because of... would cancel out..."" and so on as you wouldn't comprehend it. You do not have the ability to even argue your layman point of view with science. So all you have at your disposal is to question the motives behind the science, rather than the science itself. Too bad, because If climate science is a conspiratorial hoax as you claim, then the science would be incorrect and disputable. But you can't dispute it. In fact, no one really has. So it cannot be a conspiracy.",2.0,1.0,,Sr2J_1J9w3A,

Its ludicrous and needs to be reworked and the issues presented need to be addressed while the US is one of the wealthiest countries we do have areas of poverty as we are a large country and those areas would be the ones most negatively effected. I am not a trump supporter i am neither democrat nor republican but there are SIGNIFICANT hindrances in this 'accord' that Paris has presented that were not thought through or completely shirk off the suffering that could be caused in the USA by attempting to meet these goals. I would very much like this topic to be talked about and looked into by you both so that this feels less bias and more informative as you literally skirted over VERY SERIOUS ISSUES with this subject in making this video.

1 - how many pennies of each dollar we give actually get to the sites where the tech is supposed to go, and not in the pockets of the EU bureaucracy, local warlords, etc?  Would we not achieve more if we simply donated materiel instead of the cash they want to wring out of us?  How does this not trigger an alarm bell for you?

2 - We are not the only major carbon emissions source, China has already taken the lead.  And yet on this accord they are nowhere to be found, even in the top 20, of sources of income for this plan.  Funny, that.  Once again we bear all the blame even when we are no longer the largest source.

3 - as you noted yourself, the designated places for this new tech are places that hardly have any tech at all.  How much reduction in their carbon footprint will be achieved if they have hardly a footprint in the first place?  Would you not achieve a greater reduction in emissions using that tech in places like the U.S, China, Europe ... and then give those developing countries the old tech we replaced with the new cleaner tech?  Overall you increase energy output globally while keeping carbon footprint equal to what it is now.  Plus the company donating the old equipment gets a tax write-off for the donation.  You get more ""bang for the buck"" as the old saying goes and everyone wins.

4 - investing in renewables?  You mean like Solyndra?  Do we really have to go over this again, about why it always ends badly when the government tampers with the market?  How many times do you have to crash and burn before you realize our strongest times were always when the government backed off and only stepped in when the market was getting out of control, rather than trying to micromanage it and tilt the system with unfounded subsidies?  Granted, this is why I *do* agree in the oil subsidies going away.  With billions in profits they can pay for their own exploration, they don't need a subsidy anymore.

C'mon, man, you are supposed to be a guru at math and science, these numbers are not that difficult to ponder.  Lead with your brain on this one.  Seriously.

A plan with no set goals, no enforcement, and all too likely to end up being used as yet another leverage against us.  Frankly, I'm glad Trump is backing us out of this.  As a businessman, he knows a bad deal when he sees one, and knows when to abort then go back for a better deal.

Better yet, if we as a people truly want this we can move ahead and do it anyway, Paris Accord or no.  Why should we bind ourselves?

I will not bleed one more dollar for this third world experiment. If they are to burn, let them. Better the world for our culture to eliminate its leeches. We can rebuild from anything, and we don't need them to survive.

I have asked all my friends who have posted non-stop about this on Facebook (twice) and both times received I have received no response. All I have asked them for are their sources of proof that climate change is both man made and catastrophic. I'd like to read through it. I've seen Dr. Patrick Moore's research and another guy who's name I may not remember accurately, Bill Whittle, I think it was. Where is the science showing that global warming is man made? I find this to be highly unsourced, especially in light of active and dormant solar cycles and the history of warming and cooling period of the earth. The temperature chart is always cut very short when I see it these days so that it seems like we've had an extreme spike when all you have to do is expand that same chart out and what we've gone through the past couple hundred years is completely normal. So where is the science pointing to the fact that man has had any ability to cause at all? Also where is the science pointing to the fact that a 2 degree increase will do us any harm at all? The research I've seen points to the fact that we would be able to grow vegetation in more areas. For example Canada wouldn't have to import all of its food anymore because they be able to grow it. The history shows that there used to be goat herders in what is now desert because it used to be lush and green and that with a 2 degree raise it would be lush and green again. The earth also adjusted precipitation during that time and there was no water shortage caused by this. So again I don't feel like I have all the answers on this but when I ask people who disagree with what I've read so far on it for their sources they can never give me any. So I'm asking for some help. Also the US already is the current leader in reducing carbon emissions because of the free-market not because of political intent. Just want to make that point.

In any case, every time greenhouse gas emissions are to be reduced it is best to start with the easiest things to cut - namely energy and transport.

Reducing emissions from cows would be much more difficult.

Penalties? there should have been. One person leaving makes the paris agreement fall apart because THERE IS NO PENALTY. If the penalty were for example, OPEC raising prices of petrochemicals for violating countries until their goals were met the economic response would be similar to the Opec oil embargoes in the 70s, but one useful side effect of that was that Americans got careful and clever with their greenhouse gas use, forming carpools with their neighbors and buying better cars. We have more recycling facilities that can process the high emissions clunkers now than we did back then, so less of the material from cars junked by a similar embargo would go to waste, essentially lowering the level of emissions used to obtain that material by a car company wanting to use it (and if you asked Elon musk about recycled material cars, he'll probably tell you he did it years ago, because he's Elon Musk, no other explanation needed.)

I don't have a car myself, I happen to take the bus but I know if I could afford a car I would buy one.

Another part of it just has to do with human nature(?) and protectionism/nationalism as well as a huge part of culture in the US: individualism. I see several comments here like: ""the accord does not benefit the US"", which is extremely short-sighted... It implies you care more about people in the US than elsewhere, or have no concern with what does not directly benefit you. It also completely ignores the privilege the US has had/believes that it was ""deserved"" or earned (have you watched John's video about the study of Monopoly and how the perspective on what is fair changes?). To a lot of people (part of the same problem with people rejecting refugees), globalism is not good, and the further away someone is (culturally, economically or physically), the less you care about them, even if your neighbour and that person across the continent are both strangers. It's the ""american"" dream, where you make your own way, set yourself up, and no one but you made you. Hard-work trumps all else, and if you just work hard enough, you will have your american dream.

For example china can keep using coal till 2030 and they haven't put up the money as USA has. That it would cost trillions of dollars. Let's just say it skimp out the most notable negative features. While I agree this is a global problem and every country should take part on reducing their emissions. I feel that money we spend on the treaty could be better use, such as  bill Clinton and other people funding the green research and development. This development would allow our green energy more efficient and hopefully produce way less emission while being more reliable energy.

Also another thing the USA should work on is the way we produce thing, as an example hybrid cars are super good for the environment but the thing that is not good is the manufacturing process of the car. Which cause a lot of emission and is super bad for the world

Just look at China and the EU now: the countries are basically furious and this only adds to the decline of trust in the US. In the future the US will most likely have a harder time making any agreements, being political or economic in nature. Trust in the US economy may reduce, causing negative effects.

Consequently, we subsidize not just intentionally, but also unintentionally the fossil fuel sector. Burning such a precious resource like hydrocarbons is also stupid from a chemical stand-point. That is also where the Republican's and corporate Democrats love of the supposed free market is exposed for what it is: a convenient lie. Also, let's not forget that the Paris accords had no enforcement mechanism. I get why that was done, but it should be noted nevertheless.

Second, Plant trees and if you are a home owner do not cut down trees unless you absolutely have to and then plant another in its place.

China should get an emmissions tax as well, which they don't have in the Accord. Also, on top of that, there should be a donation fund that everyone can pitch into that will be put to use in smaller programs that wouldn't get funding normally.

Of course it comes to mind right away saving energy, turning lights off, using more your bike than you car and other stuff. But a point that is often missing is the essential decision of what we put into our mouths. Animal farming is one of the leading causes for climate change as it generates a huge share of the greenhouse gases we release everyday. The good thing is that everyone can choose what they eat. Nobody can force you to ingest anything. So something that you could do right now, without much effort, is reducing your meat and dairy consumption at the lowest levels you can. Eat more veggies, fruits, grains and nuts. Research how to create your favorite recipes without using animal products. You will be already making a huge impact if you back off from supporting animal farming. Be the change you want to see in the world. Hope this can be helpful to all those out there wishing to make a good impact in our planet! :)",0.0,0.0,,Sr2J_1J9w3A,

But I'm under the assumption that it's only purpose is to end climate change. And if that is the case then it's a good thing that American is, hopefully, pulling out of it. I'm not saying that CO2 doesn't have a warming affect. But what I am saying is that if you look at the peer-reviewed scientific literature the amount that the CO2 will warm the planet is small enough to make little to no difference. For example places like the IPCC and really depending on where you look you'll find that in articles that aren't peer-reviewed or where the author has the final say in what is published then you'll usually see an estimate from anywhere between 3 degrees F warming per doubling of CO2 all the way up to the insane 6 degrees F warming per doubling of CO2. And if you go by these estimates then yes climate change is a dangerous issue. But the facts are this isn't the case. You look at the peer-reviewed literature you'll find that you will only get a 1-1.5 degrees F warming per doubling of CO2 which isn't dangerous at all and in fact could be largely beneficial. And I know what some of you are thinking, but what about the 97% of scientists who agree with global warming. Well that number is misleading to say the least, yes 97% of scientists agree that CO2 will raise the temperature of the planet but that's not the debate, the debate is climate sensitivity where as I stated before the overwhelming amount of papers will suggest a 1-1.5 degrees F warming per doubling of CO2. And I know that science isn't done, was never been done and should never be done by consensus but what I'm suggesting isn't that because the majority of scientists agree with the 1-1.5 degrees that it's true. What I'm saying is that there isn't a paper that suggests otherwise that has been challenged where flaws have not been found. And on top of all of this if you look at the moral implications of lowering or even banning CO2 and cheap energy all together it would have a massive affect on third would countries. If you take away a developing nations access to cheap and reliable fuel which at the moment produces tons of CO2 then their life expectancy drops off dramatically especially among children. Not to mention the conversion of food to biofuel is burning food that would otherwise go to feeding the people of the world. No matter what ground you stand on, whether it's moral, economical, or you just want your everyday life to be easier everyone has a reason to stop the fight against global warming. We as a country and as a world wide society need to focus on real environmental issues that because of global warming are being overlooked and untreated. We need to develop new power sources that will benefit us instead of just finding something here and now that has only the goal of reducing CO2 emissions. But that all being said if you have any questions or you want me to clarify something or even comment on another issue regarding climate change that I didn't cover in this comment then leave a reply. I am more then happy to respond to anyone so long as they are polite and aren't just throwing childish insults. But to anyone who read this far I hope you have great day.",0.0,0.0,,Sr2J_1J9w3A,

We don't know what the benefits of our target goal will be or what it will take to even achieve that goal BUT...."" 

This is the whole point, you feel we must do something and are willing to go hostile if we don't do it but your not even sure what we should do or what kind of positive effects we should expect but 97% of scientist agree. Pardon me, but agree on what? Every one forgets to take into account is that carbon in our atmosphere is at its lowest point in history. We are forgetting during a high carbon environment is when life exploded on earth. We forget that carbon is released in the environment naturally on a massive level without human interference. DO we forget Hawaii grows every year with this mass carbon release? Do tree's not die every day? Is there carbon not released or is it buried hermetically as you presume at the start of this video?   

Your war against carbon is as logical as a war against water. It is never consumed or depleted. It's merely transfers state in a life cycle. We are Carbon, life as we know it is carbon. We and all life that we have ever encountered is a carbon based life form. From single cell organisms up to complex organisms. The Earth will cool, it will warm. It will take a giant dump on your chest and won't ask you how you feel about it. An asteriod will hit the earth, block out the sun and kill most life and plants on this earth like it has done before. Guess what, it's ok. Life has a way of making a way.

Now I don't say this as I dump my trash on the ground while releasing freon into the sky laughing like a mad man. We should be conscience of our environment and our effects on it. We should always strive to find a better way. That doesn't mean we have to enter hysteria and divide ourselves. 

Take a moment from your hyperventilation and pat yourself on the back, Good job. Believe or not the human element has actually been improving its effect on nature. this video brought up the 1800's but failed to tell you that by the turn of the century, 85% of the Forrest in American had been chopped down for fire wood prior to coal. The steam engine worked off of wood before coal. Imagine that, burning the very thing that helps. Does any one forget how how oil perked out of the ground. Where do you think the term oil ""well"" came from? They literally scooped it from the ground with buckets.

Many people like myself that agree with the fact that climate change/global warming is a serious problem that needs to be solved. I believe we are simply too early on technologically to make the changes needed AND maintain a similar standard of living for ALL. It is easy to be in favor of the changes needed because the evidence is there, but when those changes do not affect you directly you are speaking from perspective that does not have complete insight of the damage that can be done restricting our abilities to perform in the global market.

And that’s where people like you have really got it all wrong.  The big problem of Kyoto was that it put legal binding restrictions on some, while not on others.  To counter that the Paris Accord removed those restrictions.  Suddenly you had nations like China, who claimed it was “developing” and that it was unfair to put such restrictions on it, suddenly had the ability to make a “promise” of reducing emissions even more than the US?   Yep… the Paris Accord was filled with a lot of promises, most of which were empty.

The effect on this, in a global marketplace where some nations (like the leading polluter – China) rely on foreign trade for their development, any advantage that would push manufacturing into its corner is going to be grabbed.  And with this there is not reduction, simply redistribution of emissions while having detrimental effects on individual economies.

The truth is, until there is a universal agreement which enforces emission restrictions, it will not work as long as there are

Even if you assume that emission reductions is going to cost us a lot, there is absolutely no way it would cost us more than having our major production centers like New York being under a dozen feet of water when the ice caps melt.  Business could also become unfavorable if the international community decides to sanction us for failing to reduce our pollution.

“Not only does this deal subject our citizens to harsh economic 
restrictions, it fails to live up to our environmental ideals,” Trump 
said. “The bottom line is that the Paris Accord is very unfair at the 
highest level to the United States.”

Thank you for reading this, if YOU really think America can afford to continue giving money to other countries (some of which are terrorist countries) then you better be willing to give up your job, and your house, your food, you may not have access to clean water. I served for my country and found out ""We the people"" were getting dumber. But not because Climate Change threatens our world. If you do not know what Agenda 21 is, basically it's ""YOU DIE"". Do you love perpetual war? then you want the Parris Accord and you want Hitlery Clinton and more Berry Obama. Honestly, i'm amazed that terrorist didn't run for president of Paris, he literally could have. If you love Communism, go to North Korea, go to Venezuela, go to Turkey, Go to Paris!! 

Remember, the globalists plan is to make you so stupid that you only know about what's in your seeable area, if you knew these other countries existed and are failing and that Trees don't exist they can win and stop mankind from reaching the stars. We could be colonizing SPACE!!! But this is what you dumbasses want more. You will be known by your fruits.",0.0,0.0,,Sr2J_1J9w3A,

The agreement was non-binding so why stick to it when you can't guarantee that anyone else will? Firstly, because this is our planet we're talking about and even if some countries don't do their bit some reduction in CO2 production is better than none. It's certainly better than having some 70 year old think he'll be dead soon so it doesn't matter how much CO2 is produced. Secondly, look at what other countries are doing. Many countries are meeting their targets and some are even exceeding them. You don't have to just blindly trust that people will keep up their end of the deal, you can see them doing it already. Thirdly, only a greedy sack of shit would put short term economic growth before people's homes, lives and the long term food supply. Is that really how you want the rest of the world to look at you?

Look, I’m not a scientist (yet) but it is NATURAL to agree with the same voice of evolution, electricity, and medicine that is calling out a dire situation of climate change. There are three phases to a scientific truth: 1) deny deny deny. 2) claim that it conflicts with religion. 3) say that you knew it all along. Our society is in different phases and that’s okay. As long as the minority of deniers doesn’t hold power over the “pool of worries” our government is willing to handle at one time. The video above mentions your argument about the sun, and I tracked their sources to confirm the chart showed was correct. Antarctic ice is growing, if I were you I’d use that as an argument, except that it supports mine as well. Fresh water freezes first. To handle this problem, politically, have the deniers place their money in companies that would benefit off of no climate change, and have scientists pull money to invest in clean energy. In 50 years, one is guaranteed to have a net worth of 10% of its origin. That is one way to resolve the dispute. Other than that, as a voter, there’s not much else we have power over.

You have a metric tons by country graph displayed when you say that, but it doesn't really correlate to benefit (in whatever capacity you mean) and the US's benefit isn't just due to carbon dioxide emissions. The timing of the US emergence as a country should be considered when addressing the notion that coal power and emissions led to US success. This is because the country emerged just in time for coal power to catch on and infrastructure utilizing that power was constructed for the continued expansion across what became the continental US. This expansion continued with Arizona and New Mexico being the last contiguous states admitted to the union in the early 1900's; whereas European and Asian peoples had thousands of years before coal power was a thing and had significant infrastructure in place from earlier eras. For that reason, I don't know if it is fair to equate US success to carbon emissions.

Atmospheric CO2 was at 7000ppm as opposed to today's 400ppm during the Cambrian period yet the average temperature of the earth was about on par with what it is today. As early as the Jurassic period atmospheric CO2 levels were nearly 3000ppm again, as opposed to today's 400ppm. There is no comparison to draw between CO2 levels and earth's average temperature over the billions of years earth has existed. Second, let's talk about the law of thermodynamics. Just as anything else, the earth has and will continue to lose heat as the planet cools from it's formation. The same thing will happen to the sun after it expends all of it's fuel. The earth is still cooling from it's creation. Look at the super deep boar hole in Russia, one of the reasons they discontinued drilling is because measured temperatures reached more than 300° Fahrenheit. Lastly let's get into the obvious, humans have been around for far less than 1% of the total time of Earth's existence. Would you be able to accurately tell the content of a photo by only seeing less than 1% of it? Many of the statistics for basing this idea on are from a supposed recent spike in the global temperature from temperatures we have been measuring for far less than a thousand years (for argument sake I won't get into how long exactly we've been measuring temperature) now. It's also been widely accepted that during medieval times the average temperature in terms of recent time was substantially greater than the average temperature now yet we didn't have any of the modern mass CO2 releasing items  we have now. As easy as it is to have someone else just give you information and accept it as fact it's more reliable to do your own research and base your information on that. I'm not knocking you for being misinformed and feel free to verify everything I wrote, unlike the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration I don't try to change and distort information to fit an agenda.",0.0,0.0,,Sr2J_1J9w3A,

The ""average"" was not the same during the Jurassic or the Cambrian--temperatures and sea levels were much higher then.

Yes, earth was livable--the danger from global warming isn't that it will kill everything, but that it will flood coastal regions.

Yes, we know temperatures have changed in the past, due to things other than human activity.  Scientists figured out the mechanisms behind those changes, proved those mechanisms couldn't be causing the current warming, and proved CO2 could.

Of course the earth is emitting heat which has a major effect on the overall climate. Just as anything else you would heat up and then remove it from its source of heat that object will continue to radiate heat until it's used up. It's basic common sense. You, the creator of this video, Veritasium, CNN, etc. are the ones regurgitating the same information as eachother, which is based on false data. As stated before, during medieval years the average temperature was greater than it is now so by using this hoaxes flawed thinking the earth is actually cooling. With >3000ppm CO2 in the atmosphere the average still remained the same. Earth was obviously livable based on fossil evidence. Many things have been under water during different times in the past with no help from us. Glaciers have covered vast portions of the Midwest during many times in the past. They advanced, Earth followed its normal pattern of temperature heating up and melting the glaciers. Then followed the same pattern and cooled back down in which case the glaciers advances again with no human involvement. It's a giant pattern of heating and cooling yet for some reason we're only looking at less than 1% of what we know about Earth's climate. It's a money making scam.

As for your argument about the limitations on our data, your own earlier comments refute you; we know a lot about past climate conditions from geology and paleontology.  It is actually not widely accepted that medieval temperatures were significantly warmer than they are today, with scientists actively debating whether the ""medieval warm period"" was actually just a European warm spell that was overcounted in the analysis.

Reports from fishermen, seal hunters and explorers all point to a radical change in climate conditions and hitherto unheard-of temperatures in the Arctic zone.
Exploration expeditions report that scarcely any ice has been met as far north as 81 degrees 29 minutes.
Soundings to a depth of 3,100 meters showed the Gulf Stream still very warm.
Great masses of ice have been replaced by moraines of earth and stones, the report continued, while at many points well known glaciers have entirely disappeared.
Very few seals and no white fish are found in the eastern Arctic, while vast shoals of herring and smelt which have never before ventured so far north, are being encountered in the old seal fishing grounds.
Within a few years it is predicted that due to the ice melt the sea will rise and make most coastal cities uninhabitable.

The Earth's atmosphere is going through a natural climate change. This is what is actually changing. Also the problem can be fixed very simply. Stop the countries like Africa and South America from deforesting the jungles and forests as an abundance of trees will absorb the carbon dioxide because that is what they do.

Individuals can make this decision, but there is little benefit individuals see, at least right now, for the most part, especially if they think they can have meat and other animal products infrequently instead of never or would go to grocery stores instead of KFC for their chicken. 

And of course, companies have a lot of incentive to do bad things, even though we know animals, especially those with spines (but even for those who don't, we have good evidence that they do respond to pain in negative ways like we do, and I don't eat them either), feel pain and suffer much. The civil war comment reminds me of how it's like boycotting cotton made from slaves and not buying any yourself, and freeing any you own. There are still those who will not recognize the freedom of other sentient beings to exist for themselves and not for others. We actively try to stop journalists from documenting conditions in farms (a few farms like some meant for historical purposes can be OK, but most farms involved with companies in the world today do an awful job at treating their animals. 

Even the farmers themselves often can't disclose the information or take measures themselves to try and make a better life, many companies require indoor only (free range of course doesn't mean roaming outdoors, it's just being in a big indoor pitch with thousands of other birds next to you with no space to oneself) with no sunlight. This is a big problem that needs collective action to solve in my opinion. 

And of course, if these animals really were taken care of well, only given antibiotics when they have a disease and not when they are healthy, and were free range, and not killed just for meat, the price of meat would be much higher.

Mainly because it makes a huge overestimation of what each individual country can do for lowering emisions, how devoted they are to this idea and also because it is a non-binding agreement, which means no control over the processes set by the individual coutries of achieving the set goals.
2) If implemented, it would be costly, esspecially for America - loss of jobs, the rising of taxes for funding the support of developing countries and the rising of costs of fuels.
3) The Paris Agreement will create a disfunctional bureaucracy, which will lead to poor plan implementation and money syphoning.

China is continuing a trend that they've been on since the 2005 as far as reducing emissions per unit of economic output. 

But China will still grow through that time period, even though they will stop investing in coal jobs in 2030. How? Because China has a plan that will take them from 900 total gigawatts of output to 1,100 by 2020. 

There is no plan that immediately pauses anyone's growth except for America's.

1369,Ugi37po9pqAdLXgCoAEC,Ugi37po9pqAdLXgCoAEC,2017-06-04T04:38:53Z,David Yan,"Joesph Johnson I would just like to ask for some sources to your claims. I want them as direct as they can get, too. I'm not saying that you're necessarily wrong; I'd just like to analyze your sources. For example, I found this for 4: 
http://www.jpands.org/vol16no1/goklany.pdf

If you could provide some more sources, that would be great.

Also, allow me to analyze #4:

Based on the essay, I think that you should at least rephrase the statement to ""200,000 people were estimated to be at HIGHER immediate risk of dying from hunger due to rising global food prices linked to biofuel policies."" You see, the largest producers of biofuel are the U.S., Brazil, and the EU, so it wouldn't be right to say that people are starving because their crops are being taken away (because the crops used to make biofuel are probably mass-produced on industrial farms and the U.S. and EU probably already get plenty of food). Rather, you SHOULD argue that diverting crops to biofuel production raises the global price of those crops, making them less affordable to poverty-stricken peoples based on the essay.

The study then goes on to explain how biofuel policies increase poverty (while providing estimates from other studies on the headcount of people who would be in absolute poverty from additional policies), and then how people die from poverty, comparing the two.

Let's also look at the crops used to create these biofuels: Mainly corn, soybeans, and sugarcane (Source: http://biofuel.org.uk/major-producers-by-region.html). Sugarcane is definitely not a very important food crop, so let's say that it's not a problem. The website doesn't provide very much on the usage of soybeans, so let's ignore that for now too. CORN seems to be the reason why people are dying because it's being used for biofuel. I was a bit skeptical, though; corn being used for ethanol production can't have that much of an effect, right? WRONG. It turns out that the U.S. now imports corn more than they used to instead of exporting corn, and that's why ""countries like Guatemala have seen increases in hunger as the price of corn has grown due to demand for ethanol.""

This means that people ARE starving because of biofuel production. At the very least, this means that biofuel is not the best answer to a greener globe. As a leftist myself, this is quite shocking, but this does not mean that you are automatically 100% correct. It seems as though you misinterpreted this essay or, at least, whatever site you obtained the information from misinterpreted the essay as it was not about taking away yields, but rather, an increase in global corn cost. Please update your original comment. (Also include the source)

TLDR: Surprisingly, Joseph Johnson is correct on #4 that biofuel production has led to unnecessary deaths, but incorrect in his interpretation that the estimated count of 200,000 deaths was caused by peoples yields being used for biofuel. Rather, it turns out that those deaths are more of due to the US (and other countries) using its corn for biofuels rather than exporting it, leading to the increase in global corn costs, disallowing some extremely poverty-stricken peoples to afford food. This means that biofuel production isn't all great. However, this has no bearing on the validity of the other points provided, so if Joseph Johnson could provide more sources, and if there could be better discussion in this comment section, that would be awesome. (Also, the essay statistic is probably off by a bit as the essay is 6 years old; it might even be outdated as a whole, but I have not looked for newer sources, so I cannot say for sure)

This is a massive tactical blunder, leaving unnecessarily open an avenue for counterplay and spiraling off into various pointless, fruitless, wasteful quibbles over technicalities that we can't know to a sufficient degree of certainty given current data.

Why not instead discuss the fact that the big three fossil fuels, namely coal, oil, and natural gas, are finite, with an end for oil reasonably in sight and natural gas not all that far behind, and yet they comprise approximately 80% of current energy output for the planet? Nuclear fission sits at a bit over 7%, hydroelectric around 6%, and all other renewables taken together roughly equaling hydroelectric's output. There may be counterplay to the climate argument, but how does one argue against the stupidity of committing to a course that sees 80% of our total energy output dependent upon a collective resource that could easily be capped by remaining reserves at half its current value by the turn of the next century? 

We face a challenge to develop a renewable power source capable of supplanting and eventually completely replacing those finite fossil fuels before the fossil fuels themselves run out, and of what we have now, wind is an expensive and irrelevant toy, geothermal can't be scaled up at all, biomass shows little promise to even approach hydroelectric power's capability while we still have to feed a growing population, photovoltaic solar is effective at mobilizing private capital but presents prohibitive resource requirements when considering industrial-scale power, and mirror-tower solar is interesting, but would require vast amounts of materials and dedication of land in ideal locations. Fission would be helpful, of course, but irrational fear stands in the way, and it is itself finite, though with a longer usable window.

The way I see it, we're down to making fusion power work despite 60 years and billions of dollars failing to even reach break-even yet, and vast solar mirror-and-water-tower arrays, or something more exotic, and we have probably three to five generations in which to do it.

This is an effort that will make Apollo and World War II combined look like child's play, and every day we drag our feet is another day the oil window comes closer to closing forever. The only prudent way forward is to vastly expand nuclear fission power, shut down natural gas and liquid hydrocarbon and coal power plants, conserve those precious finite resources, and devote a massive strategic effort to mobilizing a large fraction of the top intellectuals in the population to teach, and eventually use, high-energy physics, high-tech engineering, and seek a meaningful, long-term solution.

Otherwise, the next 200 years may be very unpleasant, indeed.",0.0,0.0,,Sr2J_1J9w3A,

BUT, as the accord does not truly enforce a standard for each member except for US and China, it comes down to taking more money and high up taxes, which is fine for certain reason, but here in the US we have something called the National debt. Its getting close to 20 trillion. Meaning that we owe at least 5 times on what the federal reserve holds. Taking action on climate change will truly affect the economy as more taxes go towards just the environment and not paying our debts. I understand that we need to fix our planet from our own doom, but if we don't have some sort of value for our currency, then how can we even going to pay all those assets. I rather having a lower tax rate for 5 years, save that money for specific bonds that can be optional to contribute to the environment and it can actually delay the pollution rate drastically, instead of doing it now and having less owned money than borrowed. Despite all that, I am a TRump supporter, but I truly disagree on his take of climate change, but the economical circumstances won't let the citizens with enough revenue to live only by welfare, maybe seducing as to a more socialist system, rather than a capitalist system.",0.0,0.0,,Sr2J_1J9w3A,

Climate change has been happening since the dawn of time, this is a proven fact. The Earth warms up, the Earth cools down,  been doing it forever.  So with this proven fact in mind what % of climate change is man responsible for?  If the 98% of scientists agree on it why is there no answer?  Not to mention I'd love to see the world wide list of scientists so we can ask the 2% WTF?  But no such list exists, 98% is just a number someone pulled from their ass.  Without an accurate count of scientists you can not give an accurate %.  But anyone who dares to ask these questions is called a climate change denyer and laughed at, great scientific response mock someone for daring to ask questions to which no answer exists!  And if no correct answer exists why the hysteria?   Now before the haters attack me no I did not vote for Trump, but then I couldn't vote for Hillary either as I felt both were horrible choices!    

So #1 can anyone provide this accurate list of the world's scientists?  If not you must stop with this 98% nonsense all its doing is deligitimizing any climate change argument you may put forth.  And #2  what % of the current climate change is attributed to what man kind is doing?  Again if no real % number can accurately be given more harm then good is being done because then people like President Trump have an out.  You must have facts and actual measurable data to proove them wrong, talking points will not do it along.

We also believe that the best we can do is lower emissions and let time heal it, rather than the EPA being able to fix the problem of SUVs and cow farts entirely. And saying that fossil fuels have negative effects and that means we must not use them is like saying some vaccinations have negative effects, therefore we shouldn't get vaccinated. Vaccines have certain benefits that you can't get without them so we choose to get them in spite of negative consequences. Fossil fuels are the same, they are more reliable and can be used whenever, unlike wind or solar energy which can be thwarted by a drought with no wind or long durations of time without sunlight.

America is on it's deathbed and was very close to being a country like Venezuela with the owners losing their businesses over the people, riots, and etc. I feel that in order to save the world, we need to save our country. From local all the way to state wide. I do not know how much money or jobs coming back to America because of the detachment of the Paris agreement, but I am pretty sure that once our country  gets it's shit together, then we will be able to help the world. I know it sounds selfish, but in reality that's what people are doing right now as we speak. We are a individualists country. We are not China, who are more collectivist. We progress through our own hard work, and then we donate or do community service at the end. We do not work as a group and then all of get profession points for that. You can tell through college or in the workforce.

Focus on yourself first, then focus on others. How will you help others if you are broke or have less power too. I know teaming up makes sense, but that's like living in a house full of people, your the bread winner paying majority of the rent, and still getting shit on. If that's the case then I want out. That is why trump asked for a renegotiation. They said no.

As an aside, because I don't think I've ever before taken the time to comment on one of your videos, and because I like to think that there may be a slim possibility that you, yourself, may actually read this at some point (heh), please allow me to briefly express my admiration for the excellent web and media presence that you and your brother have built for yourselves and, of course, the wonderful American Dream of a business that supports it. More than any of that, though, I'd like you to know how much I appreciate and value the actual content that you used to get where you are and the strength of the information and messages which you currently use your position(s) to disseminate. From SciShow to Crash Course to your VlogBrothers posts and everything in between, you consistently offer exceptionally well thought out and executed videos that are absolutely PACKED with information and ideas which are both personally and culturally useful (as such, I frequently recommend that EVERYONE I know watch both SciShow and Crash Course not only for their own personal enrichment, but also because the more people within our society who are educated on topics such as those that you cover, the better off I feel our society will be).

I am such a fan of your work and how you interact with the considerable following that you have built, in fact, that I feel compelled to pay you the highest compliment that I can think of; the work that you and your brother, John, do, as I see it, largely performs a similar function (though in a different target area) to that of the late, great Fred Rogers - and is generally delivered with the same deep senses of compassion, gratitude, and humility that made Mr. Rogers into the incredibly important cultural figure that he came to be to millions of Americans.

And while something is better than nothing, the costs simply make the Paris Accord cumbersome and frankly, useless.

1. It limits the use of cheap energy and takes away jobs, particularly related to the coal industry, because in the 21st century that's a thing some folks still think is just the greatest.

2. Some people don't like it because it involves more foreign aid and those people basically want us to stop giving away money to other countries.  There's some legitimate fiscal concern in there, but alot of it smacks of nationalism, racism, and/or greed.

3. China and India are getting off too easy in the Accord.  They're big polluters not being required to reduce their pollution.  I'm going to plead inadequate information on their obligations, economies, etc. to have an opinion on this one.

4. Trust.  As you admit in the video this is intended as a altruistic multilateral agreement.  There is a vague bigger picture reward for each country meeting your goal, but any country that doesn't make a serious attempt to meet their obligations suffers no real punishment.  This in my mind is a serious issue.  We can't trust people not to abuse service animal privileges and freedom of speech.  How are we supposed to trust other countries on such a nebulous idea?  China is probably again the prime concern here, although at this point until Putin is dead I wouldn't trust Russia as far as I could throw them.

Withdrawing from the agreement does not stop the U.S. from pursuing green policies, if you want to promote and puruse that goal... then pressure your congressmen to do so as well, or vote out those that don't and vote in those that do... do it democratically.

The purpose of our tax dollars is to spend it supporting and protecting U.S. Citizens... the U.S. is not responsible for the economic condition of other nations. Many people are hypocrites... saying we are not the world police, so we should not be intervening, invading, occupying other nations with our military... but turn around and say that we should be the world welfare provider.

For those of you who do actually believe that we should be financially responsible for the economies of other nations... I say that The Paris Accord was a thinly veiled slush fund... massive amounts of money (our tax dollars) going to the accord, but without any clear and definite spending guidelines... we are all supposed to just trust the money is used for all the right purposes. And how does it make sense that our financial burden is much greater than other nations that pollute similar amounts per capita? On top of the higher financial penalties... we have more severe restrictions than those other nations as well. 

Lastly, and most importantly... the Paris Accord will not have any meaningful impact on the temperature increase they claim to fight. This is explained in the PragerU video ""The Paris Climate Agreement Won't Change the Climate"" and is all based on the UN's own climate prediction model. Essentially... this Agreement would cost the U.S. over One Trillion dollars to achieve practically nothing.

The video explains that, all told, we will spend at least:
$100,000,000,000,000
In order to reduce the temperature, by the end of the century, by a grand total of 0.3 degrees Fahrenheit.

There were no controls to make sure countries were following the guidelines. The only thing they agreed too was a follow up in 2020 where they all sit around a table and discuss progress.

China had a 13 year exemption for the deal. Obama never brought the agreement to the Senate for a proper adoption, because he knew he wouldn't have the support. Trump had already dismantled Obama's executive orders with his own executive orders, which already showed that he had no intention of keeping the emission targets.

The Paris agreement is a purely political, toothless, ""we all recognize climate change kumbaya"" moment for the world, but it wasn't nearly enough.

If this vacuous move by Trump inspires people to actually force their governments to take real action, it will do more for the climate than the toothless vacuous Paris Agreement ever did.

World leaders and Democrats are enraged that President Donald Trump pulled the US out of the Paris Climate Accord. Trump says, ""It was a terrible deal that crushed hardworking Americans and handed over our country's future to global power brokers. Now those very same special interests-the fake news media, Hollywood lobbyists, and the entire corrupt establishment--is attacking us from all fronts."" Climate change is a globalist money laundering scheme to redistribute wealth using scare tactics of unproven and fraudulent ""science."" Trump is putting an end to it and the fallout is immense. In 2008 the very scientists working on climate change denounced it. But the lie was repeated. Here is the truth.
 
Scientists at the University of East Anglia's Climate Research Unit (CRU), the official source of global warming/climate change data, fabricated the data. It is a lie perpetuated by politicians. The UK Telegraph, once an advocate of global warming, had a turn about in 2008. Environmentalist reporter James Delingpole blew the whistle on scientists after he obtained 1079 emails and 72 documents from the CRU. He wrote in 2009 that scientists were practicing ""Conspiracy, collusion in exaggerating warming data, possibly illegal destruction of embarrassing information, organized resistance to disclosure, manipulation of data, private admissions of flaws in their public claims and much more.""
 
Also in December of 2008 some 650 scientists refuted the concept of global warming. Nobel Prize winner for physics Ivar Giaever said, ""I am a skeptic. . . Global warming has become a new religion."" One of the UN's own IPCC scientists from Japan, Dr. Kiminori Itoh, said in the report that global warming fears are ""the worst scientific scandal in the history...When people come to know what the truth is, they will feel deceived by science and scientists.""  Environmental scientist Delgado Domingos of Portugal says, ""The present alarm on climate change is an instrument of social control, a pretext for major businesses and political battle."" These are the earthly facts behind the climate change fraud, but there is also Biblical truth.
 
Genesis 1:28 defines man's role in the environment, ""And God blessed them, and God said unto them, be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion . . . over every living thing that moves upon the earth.""  And after the great flood of Noah's time, God promised in Genesis 8:22, ""While the earth remains, seed time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease."" Jesus said in Matthew 24:4, ""Take heed that no man deceive you."" We should not be deceived by those using fear of the earth's destruction to create a new religion and a new social order. We should use these earthly facts and the Biblical truth to educate others about this political scam.",1.0,1.0,,Sr2J_1J9w3A,

The agreement states that the US must donate billions of dollars (Obama committed 3 billion) to help smaller countries lower carbon emissions, but China and India have no such requirements.

Why is it that the US has the sole responsibility in fixing the climate change issue? I agree with the decision to remove the US from this deal because I do not believe this is a fair deal. Not because I do not believe climate change is an issue.

I did a case study on climate change in Bangladesh for school. I didn't know about the investments in coal you mentioned, but I did find out the following, which you may find interesting:

1. Bangladesh is a low-lying country in a river delta, so it's vulnerable to flooding.

2. Over 50% people in Bangladesh work in agriculture, usually around rivers.

3. Stronger and more frequent storms (a consequence of climate change) increases the frequency and intensity of floods, leading to loss of land (including farmland and residences).

4. Storms + rising sea levels --> sea water intrudes more into the freshwater rivers --> drinking supplies polluted, rivers turn brackish

5. Therefore, even routine flooding of land by rivers leaves behind salt deposits, ruining crops

6. Farming families who have lost their livelihoods are forced into urban areas like the capital city, Dhaka, to work in the textile industry …

7. Where they can only afford to live in slums. Child labour also increases as adult breadwinners cannot support the family by themselves. Meanwhile, overcrowding gives rise to increased health risks and a strain on resources.

8. Dhaka is struggling with the number of refugees. Around 2000 more people come in everyday.

9. Climate refugees in Bangladesh may soon be moving into neighbouring countries

10. If the situation continues, ~50 million refugees from Bangladesh may flood the South Asian region (in comparison, there have been about 6 million Syrian refugees, and look at the trouble that caused). This may lead to geopolitical chaos and rising tensions between countries, including nuclear-armed countries like India and Pakistan.

Basically, Bangladesh is definitely one of the countries most at risk to climate change. At the same time, as you said, it desperately needs to address the amount of poverty in its country.

It's cases like these that really show how much richer countries need to contribute to prevent climate change. Or else everyone will suffer.",12.0,1.0,,Sr2J_1J9w3A,

pretty good list! Fortunately a lot of those things are actually really beneficial for your health and personal finance, which will ultimately be the biggest driver in changing consumeristic behavior, at least in first world countries. Lots of behavioral economists are studying this and are trying to find new ideas to incentivise people to be more mindful about consumption habits.

There are movements for Environmental reparations in the countries and places where fossil fuels have had much impact. In the United States, the oil industry owes the state of Louisiana at least $40 Billion in lost marshlands from oil and gas development in the 1960s and 1970s, and there are similar cases around the world.   http://www.nola.com/opinions/index.ssf/2017/06/oil_gas_coastal_restoration.html",0.0,1.0,,Sr2J_1J9w3A,

The difference is, the United States doesn't  conquer anymore and assists other countries, Though, it's through economic actions and examples.

History is history and Brits, Pics, Scots, Gauls, Norse, Teutonic, Slav, Chin, Mongol, and a whole lot more  have not floor to stand on when speaking about genocide or slavery or any of that, and if they had modern weapons in their time of ascension, they would be exactly the same as ISIS. The thing about America is that the people run the government rather than the other way, and most nations are still top down dictatorial nations, even the Western European who aspire to have the government control via socialism.

That all being said, if this was a handshake, then the USA wasn't needed. If America wasn't leading here, then the USA isn't needed. If this was about the climate, then the USA is already ahead of the other countries and doesn't need the agreement.

Now, you say this is non-binding, but that means you don't know American law. According to the US Constitution, treaties, even non-binding ones, carry the same weight as an amendment to the Constitution. According to the Treaty on Treaties, any agreement, even a non-formal on that hasn't been voted on by the US Senate, can be considered a treaty and is the President agrees to the terms within the accord or treaty, it is the same as it passing a vote. In other words, it might not be binding to the rest of the world, but by law it is binding to the USA.

As for whether it works or not, with it as is, by 2030, with India and China not held to is and China increasing at it's current rate, it will decrease the temperature by less than a half of a degree in 100 years. After that, all bets are off. Meanwhile, if stops America from exploring better alternatives via natural gas and coal to oil. It stops increases in fracking and it stops the increased mining of coal to sell to China to replace as much of their worse coal, which they mine or buy from places like North Korea (that's a political bargaining chip).

Meanwhile, it costs in business and in actual money billions, if not trillions of dollars. All of which can be used in the private sector to develop better green technology, to work on solving most of the world's more pressing issues like malnutrition and starvation and disease, and it doesn't take into account that technology in the next ten years could be so different the agreement will be so far out of date, it will be worse.

Now, let's also remember, the United States doesn't actually have the money to give. We are spending so much that we are broke. We print money and borrow it. You remember Zimbabwe or Wiemar Germany? Yes, let's spend more money that we don't have on a solution that doesn't work to fix a problem that is near the bottom of the pile and the most difficult to agree on let alone solve.

The thing it, if you are so upset about the United States waging war and being an economic empire, you shouldn't want this anchor around your collective necks. If the United States goes down and you are tied to her, you are going down with her. You think Greece was bad for the EU? This of this as that, but with it more like the EU taking down Greece.

To sum up:
- This is, by US law a treaty and, therefore, binding, even if not binding in your country.
- If the US isn't a leader, you don't need us, if the accord doesn't matter, you don't need us.
- The US is ahead of the world in this anyway.
- The us government is broke, so there is no money to spend here.
- This agreement doesn't work and does more harm than good.",3.0,1.0,,Sr2J_1J9w3A,

The reason that they are still supported by the PTC and ITC tax credits are simply so that they can grow as an industry at around double the rate they would otherwise.  Nevertheless, even without said credits,  the industry is set to quite easily overtake cold, and, soon enough, compete with natural gas-- especially NG with carbon capture and Storage. However, as most solar and wind plants would appear to be situated in republican districts (due to business friendly policies) conservative constituents would arguably have the most to lose if they were no longer supported.

Well, one, for political reasons: if we become allies with the poorer countries in the Philippines or at least get a foothold through helping them with this, we can gain ground on China and stop them from taking over the South China Sea. 
Two: we have the money to, and as one of the premiere polluters in the world who set the example of saying: hey fossil fuels are okay, we need to set the precedent that they're not and give poorer countries the ability to keep up with us. 
Also: we are a hegemonic power throughout the entire world. The way you keep hegemonic power is by helping smaller countries achieve greatness. We did it with Japan. They are now an ally and a major economic power. Same with Brazil. Russia did it with China. Britain with Australia. If we had more allies in the Philippines, we would control major shipping routes through Asia. If we don't do it, we turn people against us, especially island nations like the Philippines who are DIRECTLY being affected by climate change.

' Pretty much everything that is weak, disappointing, and inadequate about that deal is the result of U.S. lobbying since 2009.

The fact that the agreement only commits governments to keeping warming below an increase of 2 degrees, rather than a much safer firm target of 1.5 degrees, was lobbied for and won by the United States.

The fact that the agreement left it to individual nations to determine how much they were willing to do to reach that temperature target, allowing them to come to Paris with commitments that collectively put us on a disastrous course towards more than 3 degrees of warming, was lobbied for and won by the United States.

The fact that the agreement treats even these inadequate commitments as non-binding, which means governments apparently do not have anything to fear if they ignore their commitments, is something else that was lobbied for and won by the United States.

The fact that the agreement specifically prohibits poor countries from seeking damages for the costs of climate disasters was lobbied for and won by the United States.

The fact that it is an “agreement” or an “accord” and not a treaty — the very thing that makes it possible for Trump to stage his action-movie slow-mo walk away, world in flames behind him — was lobbied for and won by the United States.

The issue here is that money motives are mixing with environmental policy motives. The fact that China and India agreed to this policy should already be a red flag for that. The issue here goes far beyond the US simply having to cut back on emissions and switch to green energy and shift its economy. It's likely that hundreds of thousands of Americans will lose their jobs as huge employers go down the crapper. But this will likely be balanced out as the economy changes as these workers go into different jobs and these businessmen take their money into different enterprises. That's regarding how the US will be affected on the national level.

The much more profound issue here is on the international level. In this video, you're not taking into consideration the global market.

Why did the US withdraw from the Paris Accord for an indefinite period of time? Why did China (who almost always rejects calls for international policy regarding the environment) gladly accept the Paris Accord? I'll give you a clue: it's probably not because China suddenly cares about the environment. It's probably because the Paris Accord disproportionately cripples the US. Personally, I'm fine with cutting back on economy for the sake of long-term environment goals. However, that would only be okay if the distribution is proportionate.

If the US said yes to the Paris Accord, by 2025, the US would have to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 26% below what it was in 2005. First off, that's a huge amount that's estimated to cut down on hundreds of thousands of US jobs and pop a big hole in the US economy. But putting that aside since its hypothetically possible that the US would be able to do a rapid and dramatic shift in its economy, there's an even bigger issue. China and India don't have to abide by such a rule despite the fact that China and India are huge CO2 polluters and our rising economic rivals. Instead, the rule China has agreed to is ""China will lower its emissions per unit of GDP within the range of 60 percent to 65 percent below the 2005 level by 2030."" There are some key points to note here:

1 The US has to abide by the rule by 2025 as opposed to China's 2030 which gives China 5 years to swoop up more of the market than they already have. This is of course despite China already having the world's highest GDP.

2 The US has to drop its emissions by a fixed amount, but China doesn't. Yes, on the surface, it looks like China has to drop by a bigger percentage, but its based on the size of their GDP. It could essentially be stated as efficiency in terms of pollution per unit of GDP. So if China continues to grow its economy (which it looks like it's on track to do), it can pollute more than ever. This is the key point to note. The US reduction is based on pollution amounts whereas China's reduction is based on pollution amounts relative to its GDP. The distinction is huge. 

3 Additionally, this is relative to China's 2005 amount. Unlike the rule for the US in which it would be easier for the US to use a more current year, China would have an easier time using a further back year since they were even less efficient back in 2005. Keep in mind that China's already made quite a bit of efficiency progress compared to 2005 so they're already a good chunk of the way there. This is because China in the past used incredibly inefficient technology and as they get more updated technology from the West, they make progress towards this goal. However, the technology the US uses is actually top of the line. The US technology in industry sectors has for decades been one of the most efficient in the world. So for China to cut back on emissions per 2005 GDP, it simply has to grow and get its technology updated; this is essentially asking them to catch up to the US' technology but with a far bigger economy. Yet for the US to meet the requirement, we can't simply implement more updated technology because we have the most updated technology; we'd have to develop new technology (which we already do but R&D will never be as fast as simply copying or receiving existing tech) or abandon those industries.

India has a similar condition with essentially the same caveats: ""India has pledged to reduce its emissions per unit of GDP to within the range of 33 percent to 35 percent below the 2005 level in 2030.""

As if this wasn't enough, there is also a part of the Paris Accord in which developed nations pledge at least 100 billion dollars to developing nations. Firstly, China and India are still classified as developing nations, so a good portion of this money could easily go to them. The wording for which countries get how much is vague at the moment so that's only a possibility.

Secondly, the 100 billion dollars is a floor amount, meaning that the actual number could be much higher once 2020 rolls around (2020 is when this whole thing is supposed to start taking effect). 

Thirdly, the calculation of who pays what amount isn't determined. We can see from NATO that Europe has no problem with significantly underpaying while simultaneously relying on the US to pay the bulk of the expenditures. The Paris Accord has been in the works for years so they had plenty of time to finalize the numbers and specifications; I'd bet my bottom dollar that they were kept intentionally vague so the US could pay the brunt of this money.

So yeah, the Paris Accord in its current form would have been a horrible decision for the US. That being said, I think global warming and other environmental issues are very serious and need to be rapidly addressed. My issue with the Paris Accord is not that global warming doesn't exist. My issue with the Paris Accord lies within its policies and the potential negative, disproportionate effects of these policies. I think it's incredibly naive to believe that China of happily signed onto this 
agreement because China really cares about the environment. China knows that taking a blow from this agreement is still a win if the US position in the world economy gets crippled.

I would also like to add that I am for the US going into the Paris Agreement under more fair conditions. I also specifically said ""fair"" as opposed to ""harsh"" because my concern is about the relative blows countries have to take as opposed to how severe these blows are.",1.0,0.0,,Sr2J_1J9w3A,

Regarding polar bears: ""In May 2010 the SWG prepared a report to the JC (SWG 2010) outlining the current 
available information on population status. The SWG concluded that the estimates of abundance 
and vital rates for BB and KB were out of date. Further, population viability analysis (PVA) 
using these data and current harvest levels resulted in 100% of simulations projecting that both 
subpopulations would decline after 10 years (PBSG 2010). The SWG informed the JC that 
simulations are typically run no more than 10-15 years beyond the date when data were last 
collected, meaning the PVAs were outdated and therefore unreliable.""

""I'm pretty sure that the increase in made made CO2 is causing the Earth to get greener, after all CO2 is what plants eat.""
Data shows that the size of their stomata decrease rather than compensating by growing more.

""But Carbon dioxide in the air can dissolve in rain water to form carbonic acid, H2CO3. Carbonic acid is a weak acid.  Extra CO2 increases the likelihood of acid rain which acidifies the water masses as well.  However, considering the Earth naturally produces 3000 GigaTons of CO2 every year and people only generate 6GT per year ...""
The 3000 gigatons of CO₂ are reabsorbed by plants and other photosynthetic organisms, forming a dynamic equilibrium. The extra CO₂ cannot be reabsorbed, causing ocean acidification.

So that only proves the point that carbon dioxide causes warming.

The reason for the accelerated melting is that the higher temperatures are caused by more air in the Arctic. (The ideal gas law: PV=nRT) But then they added: ""But even if the added air is warming the Arctic, who’s to say that the shifting circulation isn’t itself due to climate change?""
Furthermore, it was only a short-term phenomenon. (""But when Ding averaged the climate models together, the air circulation changes cancelled each other out—like a balanced equation. They only data that remained in the models was responding to external forcings, like greenhouse gas emissions."")
The last paragraph even stated ""Ding is quick to point out that this doesn’t mean that climate change isn’t real.""

""This is not productive.  I would like to get to the truth but when people like the Green brothers, whose videos, as you are probably aware, are shown in K-12 schools nation wide, make biased videos the truth becomes more and more unreachable.""
How is this video biased? Point the biases out and explain them.

'The ""consensus"" is what the general population accepts.'
False. The consensus is a consensus of the conclusions of peer-reviewed scientific papers, and thus legitimate research.

""And what the population accepts is what the government creates tax and spending laws around.""
No comment.

""So if anthropomorphic (man made) climate change is real, then yes, lets do something about it.  But if it's not, I don't my government going another $20 trillion dollars into debt fighting a boogie man that doesn't exist.""
That is true. However, anthropogenic climate change has been shown to be true.

""Until we start making predictions that actually come true 90% of the time then I do not want lawmakers to tax me or to regulate businesses to stop emitting CO2 when CO2 might not be causing any problems and might actually be helping feed the world.""

""I hope you're aware of the Russian Academy of Sciences view on Anthropomorphic Climate Change.  Basically they say it's a load of hogwash, using their theories of the Sun's cosmic rays effecting our climate they accurately predicted the rise in global AND the warming hiatus AND they are predicting global cooling for the next 50 to 200 years.""
So you're saying that they predicted a hiatus when none has occurred? Okay. The hiatus resulted from cherry-picking data starting from a year with abnormally high temperature (El Niño or La Niña, one of those) and drawing a flat line to when the warming caught up with that year. It was never a hiatus.

""Now go ahead, tell me that your sources are better than my sources and that somehow you are capable of determining whether the RAS is more or less correct that the NOAA or NASA.""
I am not familiar with the RAS, and I will not say whose sources are better, as they are likely the same. The hiatus only results from cherry-picking.

""There is NO SCIENTIFIC CONSENSUS OF Anthropomorphic Climate Change.""
Sorry, I can't hear you over the insane amount of papers predicting global warming since the 19th century.

""There was, however, scientific consensus for thousands of years that the Earth was the center of the universe and that the sun orbited the Earth.""
Ptolemy? Science was not practiced back then. It was, at most, a religious consensus. Regardless, science has corrected that model. This is entirely different as anthropogenic global warming was predicted since the 19th century by Svante Arrhenius, and subsequent temperature measurements have only confirmed this prediction.

""Which is why the claim to authority of the consensus is a logical fallacy.""

I believe what people mean when they say ""stop climate change"" is to stop the current rapid increase in global temperatures, not climate change in general.

""It's a natural cycle. The increase in CO2 causes a greater amount of vegetation to grow, thus trapping more heat in the Earth's atmosphere. Eventually, the amount of vegetation begins to consume more CO2 than animal life and volcanic sources produce, and the vegetation begins to thin""
Sadly, that is not the case. If it were, the carbon dioxide concentration would not rise as much as it did. If we take that hypothesis further, we would come to the conclusion that the carbon dioxide concentration would not deviate much as an increase in it would be opposed by a corresponding increase in plant populations. However, the geological record contradicts this, with carbon dioxide concentrations much higher during the Cretaceous. There is also the fact that plant stomata shrink with increased carbon dioxide concentrations, so they would not take up more carbon dioxide either.",0.0,1.0,,Sr2J_1J9w3A,

We dont know what the effect of our goal will be, We don't know how to achieve our gaol AND we dont know how much it will cost to achieve the goal we know nothing about..... 

BUT while trying to balance the budget in the U.S, we should plan to spend hundreds of billions of dollars developing undeveloped countries who are only going to increase their carbon imprint with the plan to later lower them in 13 years from but we should pay now? How has that helped any one? The very notion of developing undeveloped countries you are only increasing globing warm. The U.S should pay because we benefited from an industrial revolution and should pay the world back? Again how has any of this lowered emissions?

How has leaving this make emissions worse? The math doesn't add up. This agreement seems to redistribute wealth between advanced nations to undeveloped nations to develop them. How about the wealthy nations spend that money on their own infrastructure to further reduce the emissions they are creating.

Basic arithmetic tells me if you turn a fishing village into a ""clean"" paper mill you have only made things worse. I don;t care how clean it is. If you industrialize previously un-industrialized areas, emissions do not go down. They go up.

If you a leave an agreement that does develop undeveloped areas, emissions go down. Just by not funding their development. 

This reminds me of ethanol. Takes 2 gallons of gas to make 1 gallon of ethanol that only goes 3/4's as far as gas did in an attempt to lower emissions.

Given this news, I think it's important that people make the corporations of America aware that the customers want lower emissions. If a large enough group of people get together and say that they will only buy from companies that honors the Paris climate agreement in the absence of government regulation, then the companies will naturally shift to greener sources of energy. Even if only half of the US population were to be on board with this, the monetary collateral companies would face would be enough to force them to go green.

1. I do not disagree that the US is likely to be negatively impacted because of the timeline set forth. (Fact) These efforts should have been implemented sooner, perhaps in the 60s when companies started realizing the impact of greenhouse gases. (Fact and Opinion)

2. While the national debt and poverty are a big problem, their resolution can stem from national politics by balancing out the national budget or making the federal reserve a public entity rather than a private one. (Opinion) And economic growth can be achieved without increase in emissions. (Fact)

3. Given the benefits the US garnered from centuries of CO2 emissions, it should accept the responsibility towards other world citizen and to the future. (Opinion) And shouldn't condemn people in countries like the Maldives, who emit little to none in CO2, but are at an overwhelming risk of becoming climate change refugees due to rising sea levels. (Fact)

4. China doesn't get a free pass. At the COP21, they decided to make the biggest cuts. (Fact Can be found on the COP21 website) They just argued that developing countries shouldn't be held to the same burden of proof as developed countries (fact). 

5. The accords are no where near perfect but the cost of human lives should come before economics.

But the prospects of C.C. already are upon us and I believe with or without the green movement things such alternative fuel sources were inevitable because of the.....progressive progress of technology.

Climatologists are subject to the same sorts of editorial rigor that any scientific discipline has. Do people throw out the whole thing or just ""believe"" the parts that hey agree with.

Surely people don't honestly believe that an entire field of science, and all the interdisciplinary research that is has been done is simply wrong?

No, it's not that simple. Many detractors will state in their arguments something to the effect of ""the earth's climate always changes.""
That statement is very telling about the argument because it shows that they fundamentally agree with the science, up to the point when it conflicts with what they believe. I have seen no one cite a reason for why the cutoff is there.

Others will say something like ""there is no evidence"" or ""it's all unproven"" and that is partly, I believe, the fault of our education system, but it also shows a willful ignorance or an unwillingness to follow through on curiosity.

as an Indian, let me give you some facts.
First off, we never demanded foreign aid. We have been working on technology for more renewable forms of energy. All we said is that we would require adequate technology and funds for certain large scale products, and we said that to encourage business INVESTMENTS​. Not AID. Because our current government is working on breaking down tax and other restrictions to allow more FDI.
Secondly, an average Indian uses less than one tenth of the electricity that an average American does (as statistics say). So really, which country is producing more energy?
I'm not accusing the normal American citizen here, don't get me wrong. But it's funny how Trump sides with India for his anti-Pakistan plans, then turns the gun on us with lies and slander as a justification for his climate change hoax theory.
And I figured you should know the truth. We aren't allowed to build thousands of coal plants as Trump said. We're definitely not demanding billions and billions of foreign aid like he said. We are a country of 1.2 billion people who are doing all they can for this initiative, despite cultural polarization, poverty and corruption and a million other problems, and we will do our best in this regard, no matter what Trump says.

1) Reduce the amount of meat and dairy you consume. The less the better. Vegetarianism may not be possible for you or your family, but cutting back (on dairy and beef especially) will lower your footprint substantially.
2) Turn off lights when you aren't using them; only heat and cool your houses as necessary. Conditioning air takes up a huge amount of energy. I live in Florida, so I know summers especially can be rough--but avoid making your house winteresque during the summer and vice versa.
3) Cut back on your driving alone (if possible). I ride my bike but that may not be tenable for everyone. Carpool to work. Take public transportation. Invest in a hybrid or electric car when it's time to make your next automobile purchase.
4) Contact your government officials (especially state and local) about incentivizing green technology for businesses and individuals. Many states and cities are taking it upon themselves to reduce their climate impact. Your local officials may also be sympathetic but they won't act unless there's the political will to. Show them that there is. 
These steps also have positive externalities on the health of you and your community. Even if you disagree with the scientific consensus on climate change, you will find yourself reaping benefits from doing these steps anyways.

Plant based diets are extremely nutrient rich, because its primarily vegetables! The National Health Organization and the American Dietetic Association both agree with me, stating that vegan diets are nutritionally adequate and healthy for all stages of life-
 even infancy. 

Additionally more labor goes into meat production than ever goes into plant production, because cows and pigs and chickens need to eat something, so we feed them food that is taking up farm land that could be used to help reduce world hunger :) With nearly a billion malnourished people on earth we shouldn't allow over half of all crops grown to go to feed livestock. Eating meat and animal products is not only cruel to animals, but also to the humans who could be saved by more ethical land use.

You are absolutely right- there is no perfect way to live your life, but going vegan does absolutely decrease the amount of world suck. Crop agriculture for example- Most crops grown are actually fed to live stock rather than humans, which means that it takes significantly more resources (water, land and the harmful things you mentioned etc) to produce a pound of meat than it does to simply harvest crops. It is all about harm reduction. There is also the humanitarian issue of slaughter house workers and crop farmers who are often low income immigrants who, in the case of slaughter houses, often develop PTSD from the trauma of being forced to kill animals so harshly and quickly. It is truly the stuff of nightmares. All animals go to the same type of slaughter houses, even locally raised animals (Unless the farmer kills their animals themselves. However I do not believe there is a humane way of killing an animal who is too young and shows clearly that they do not want to die.) 

As for the source, I am going to link you to a fantastic master post that you can read through if you are interested. It includes the article that I am referencing in ""The Environment"" section.

Climate change is real. There is no denying it. 
However, we humans have not been able to monitor global temperatures for much more than 100 years. We aren't actually sure if this climate change is a natural result of the earth orbiting the sun or if we are the cause (I'm going to bet on the former). 
Regardless, the USA has been donating to world causes since WWII (over 70 years at this point) with little to no return on the investment. Furthermore, since this is an unenforceable accord, who knows what the countries are actually doing with the money that we donate to them? Trump, a businessman, realizes that our economy can only take so much more of this kind of spending, so he backs out. 
Also, notice how the private sector has decided to pay the donation that we otherwise would have made. Because we backed out of this agreement, that's 15 million dollars of taxpayer money that is going to be reallocated to (insert government benefit program here). I would say that's a win.

Also it functions from -20 to +60 degrees, so it is a reliable energy-recourse for cars and such in any temperature setting.
So that problem seems to have been solved. With that electric cars will make a huge leap forward soon. (they will have 3 times the range and only need to charge up as long as you would need to pump petrol in it.)

One of the best ways to do this is to stop buying solar panels and the relatively clean LNG produced in the United States, and instead mine and refine the fuels themselves. This would hurt the US jobs dependent on LNG and renewables and hurt the environment. Think of it as a bribe to keep US jobs and simultaneously protect the environment.",2.0,1.0,,Sr2J_1J9w3A,

The Paris Accord set a goal for the country to reduce the use of fossil fuels, this means that if you have a company that research and develop green energy technology you could get funded. This means your company grows and needs more workers, that means more jobs.
It also means that you're developing a technology that the future WILL be using more and more, which means that you're developing the future.
2. You're ""paying"" to increase your own future. The reason a ""deal"" like the Paris Accord is needed is, like said in the video, is that because fossil fuels are cheaper to use, right now, so to make global economy work everyone has to agree to work together. If the USA breaks out of this deal then what's stopping the other global superpowers to do the same? The USA now has an advantage that they can burn fuel as they want, but it could backfire- heavily. Countries can decide that products made in the USA will have a higher import tax because they moved away from the Paris Accord, thus making American products a lot more expensive and less desirable. It's also definitely going to slow down the future development in green technology in the USA while the rest of the world continues the development.
3. It's not just about reducing the carbon emissions, it's about investing in future technologies. Technologies that are expensive to research and so far doesn't bring a lot of income.
Think of it like the moon mission or NASA work in general, sucks up a lot of money and initially doesn't bring much back. Then research in NASA comes out with the MRI scanner, saving millions of lives world wide and bringing inn massive money. This could be the same thing that Green Technology results in eventually.
4. Giving money to less developed countries is an attempt to kickstart their green technology or environmental friendly systems. India (as an example) has seen massive growth in living standards the past decades but they use a lot of cheap, fossil, energy. Helping them to develop more is a good thing for everyone. People need to stop thinking that they're one country, we're one PLANET that should invest in this goal.

And yes, technically the Treaty can't just be dropped at the whim of the US President. At the very least, it takes years to pull out. But why would Trump, who has shown no interest in norms and laws up until this point, care about what the Treaty says? If he DID just drop out tomorrow, without following proper procedures, to whom does he answer? No one, at this point. The checks and balanced of our government continue to fail.

Frankly, if Trump randomly invaded Mexico tomorrow who would stop him? Congress sure as hell wouldn't, and the Courts could try but that's way out of their purview. The Democratic Party would start talking about how this new war with Mexico is good news for their election prospects in 2018. The Republicans would avoid or attack reporters who asked them about it and then laud Trump's decision as the greatest in history. Trump supporters would continue to claim that they are somehow the victims in American society, despite controlling all branches and all levels of the Government. After all, who cares about how much power you really have if the Liberal media is still mean to you? 

 If the Europeans, and indeed the rest of the world, are serious about stopping Climate Change, they would enact economic sanctions against the United States, a Trade Embargo if necessary. 

Europeans should consider examining the US's compliance with the NATO Action Plan, which reads requires member states ""to have stable democratic systems, pursue the peaceful settlement of territorial and ethnic disputes, have good relations with their neighbours, show commitment to the rule of law and human rights, establish democratic and civilian control of their armed forces, and have a market economy.""

Trump is unlikely to be re-elected (or even run again) for the next term, and then the US will almost certainly work with the rest of the world to decrease pollution again. California will still do its part to reduce pollution and others might follow suit.

It's a feel good idea with little substance and not much in the way of actual results. The agreement is only until 2030 and China doesn't have to do anything until after 2030. It also assumes that the vast majority of the reduction of CO2 emissions will happen after 2030. If that doesn't happen we are looking at spending $100 trillion to reduce global temps by .05 degrees C by 2100. According the the Wall Street Journal our county is already on track to reduce CO2 emissions on the production side. So we don't need to get into any treaty or agreement anyway.

In this setting (called stranger in Figure 3), a punisher could not reap any benefit from the future cooperation of the punished free rider because the free rider was never in the punisher’s group in future periods. Therefore, there cannot be any selfish benefit from punishing a free rider in the stranger setting.

Av J, I definitely agree that this is a bad thing, and no matter what we change it to it will eventually get washed out perhaps even intentionally, but here is my counterpoint.  Before the conversation about climate change really kicked off, saving the environment/environmentalism was already a thing, mainly focused against pollution and industrialization.  This made it easy for some groups of people to label any talk about the environment as from ""those tree-hugging hippies"", a connotation which has at least partially carried over to the climate change issue.  I feel like this is part of the reason why some people are able to discredit any attempts to fix climate change as an overreaction or as anti-industrial/manufacturing.

I don't think that habitability has those connotations yet, it hasn't been politicized, and it's not as vague as ""the environment"", rather it literally means how suitable our planet is to live on, so that I argue would make it more resistant - but I agree not impervious - to being politicized.",6.0,1.0,,Sr2J_1J9w3A,

Your article gives a brief overview of how this can be problematic, and I agree. Frankly, we are not technologically prepared to switch to 100% renewable energy yet. What you neglect, however, is that nothing in the Paris agreement says we have to. 

The Paris agreement is about making efforts to reduce carbon emissions by increasing renewable energy usage. No one said we had to go all the way right this instant. Getting 100% brings a host of complex problems that we aren't prepared to face, but that doesn't mean that wind or solar are ""failures"" or ""don't work."" We don't need them to work for 100%, we need them to work for more than they do now. 

The US currently gets less than 7% of its electricity from wind and solar [source: https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&t=3 ]. We would not run into serious problems with energy forecasting if we were just trying to increase this to 20% or 30%.

While global warming may be a certain percent natural most of it is caused due to human activity.""In its Fifth Assessment Report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of 1,300 independent scientific experts from countries all over the world under the auspices of the United Nations, concluded there's a more than 95 percent probability that human activities over the past 50 years have warmed our planet.""
https://climate.nasa.gov/causes/
Another reason why scientists know that climate change is not natural is because the temperatures of the sun are at low temperature. If climate change were natural then we would be experiencing an all time low in temperatures.

Your claim that it is non-lethal is simply just not true. There are MAJOR consequences to temperatures rising only 4-7 degrees. While it may seem like a small difference, it is the literal difference between life and death for most organisms.We have already assured extinction for many animals that have existed for many years.An example of this would be corals bleaching due to rising temperatures in the oceans.You might think that just because animals are dying it may not affect us, but this can increase the amount of pests and invasive species that thrive in warmer climates. Cleaning up disasters that happen from this can cost billions of dollars.

Another argument to be made is that growing crops would be harder.For the past 10 thousand years global temperatures have remained at a relatively steady rate with only about a 1 degree difference in each direction.Right now the current shift in temperatures is about 2 degrees in each direction.If this continues it could be much harder to grow food in the future.

Aside from the loss of jobs, the cost of the climate accord is an estimated 1-2 trillion dollars per year (according to the

Finally, even if all nations agreed to meet their emission goals (which is unlikely), by the year 2100, the climate will be 0.2 degrees cooler than it was before. This is according to the UN's own climate prediction model.

In essence this accord doesn't even work based on their own predictions. I do not deny climate change and I acknowledge that man made emissions contribute to global warming.

If the polar ice caps are melting then why is antarctic sea ice reaching a new record maximum? Why is only northern polar ice caps melting?
- Regional specifics are hard to predict particularly for regions with relatively low density of data (such as the poles). Wind patterns like the jet stream can change and ""get stuck"" due to climate change resulting in some regions getting longer periods of cold weather than before while other regions get longer periods of heat. But just because science can't explain everything doesn't mean it can't explain anything. The uncertainty on the science of climate change is much smaller than the uncertainty on economic forecasts.

We know the world was much warmer before mankind (because of large amounts of hydrocarbons) than it is projected to be. How did other animals thrive (and they did thrive) and what can we learn from them?
- animals back then didn't rely on agriculture to feed themselves, didn't live in massive cities on the coasts, and had thousands of years to adapt to changing temperatures and still a large number of them went extinct due to climate changes. So do you feel lucky?

There are fossils of alligators and palm trees north of the arctic circle. If the world was able to cool down from that then isn't the climatologist ""Point of no Return"" inaccurate?
- Yeah most of them are from when the land currently north of the arctic circle was much farther south. ""Point of no Return"" doesn't mean forever on geologic timescales (i.e. millions of years) as something like a comet strike or a shift in Earth orbit could easily reverse it, it means not within the lifetime of our current civilization (it's only a few hundred years since we were wearing armor and riding around on horseback) or possibly within the lifetime of our species. 

If climatology was an exact science then what is the effect of 1 ton of CO2 on global temperatures? 2 tons?
Climate models can make those predictions though the level of uncertainty is probably larger than the effect size for such a small quantity of CO2 on a global scale. However, humans have release many orders of magnitude more than that. 

Why can't humans adapt to the conditions of a warmer world? 
- They definitely could but there is a good chance it could result in the collapse of western civilization and massive population declines. I for one don't want to live in a post-apocalyptic hellscape if it could be avoided by paying 10% more for electricity than I currently do.

What percent of climate change is caused by humans? 
- approximately 80%",0.0,1.0,,Sr2J_1J9w3A,

I do have some opinions based upon what I have been spoon fed on the issue. It seems that America was being looked to as the leader to set the example for others to follow on ways to at least slow down the greenhouse effect. Other developing nations and third world nations need help if they even hope to change for the better and follow the American example. It all comes down to economic output which is driven by energy of one form or another. The issue is that America was being disproportionately singled out in helping others do their part and suffer the pain of doing so while at the same time shutting down its own emissions in the process. In other words, we were being asked to do too much; so much that it would place our robust economic output in jeopardy while others gained advantage. This is a problem that needs to be resolved with technology not prohibitions and added taxation.",1.0,1.0,,Sr2J_1J9w3A,

I don't disagree that natural climate change exists. And no one will drop dead at the exact second the temperature increases a fraction of a degree too much. But people are dying from lung sicknesses due to pollution. Some countries in the Pacific are less than 2 meters above sea level, and will disappear antirely if the oceans rise. Their inhabitants would lose their homeland. That's no small matter. 
You pointed out that at some point the north pole was warm and reptiles were living there, and the earth was warmer even that what the climate scientists predict for our near future and some other species were flourishing then. But those species were not humans. Whatever happens with the climate in the next hundred or thousand years, whether humans evolve to adapt to the changes or not, the earth will remain. The earth itself is not in danger of disappearing. We are. The earth as we know it, and on which humans can live, might be disappearing. Not in a cataclismic event, but gradually. The Paris Agreement and all those conventions and charters and such, are trying to protect the future of humans on earth. And we'll not reverse natural climate change, but we should at least do something about the part of climate change that we're responsible for.
Also, speaking from France here, yes our electricity is nuclear, it's cheap, and we're mostly independant. It's clean, if you consider CO2. I wouldn't be worried either if I lived near a nuclear plant. Except it creates radioactive wastes, and the disposal of those wastes was never well thought of. It's a bit like fracking, the source of energy is clean when you use it, not when you get or make it. So now the idea is to build reinforced caves somewhere and bury the wastes there. Of course, the neighbours are not thrilled. Also, some environmentalists in France have put the nuclear civil industry on the enemy list, and there's a never-ending debate : should we stop the old plants that were not conceived to work as long as they already have, or should we keep using them ? Are they safe ? If we stop them, how do we replace them ? 
So it's not entirely popular either. There's no perfect solution, I'm afraid. But certainly it's better than sending back minors digging coal.",4.0,1.0,,Sr2J_1J9w3A,

1) True. Makes sense. China's population is 4 times the US.
2) Source? After googling I found an article from something called The Daily Caller that said that China said their CO2 output would peak in 2030 and the article made it seem like China wouldn't even be changing anything they're doing to reach that goal. That does sound kinda crappy but then again they're 1.4 billion people and as you said, they're going through an industrial revolution. I also found a Washington Post Article called ""As U.S. backs away from climate pledges, India and China step up"" (afraid to link because I don't know if that will put this comment in spam) that said China is investing more money, a further $360 Billion by 2020, than any other country.
3) Again, they're the largest country in the world and 4 times larger than the US. Everything I'm finding seems to say they're taking steps to reduce this.
4) Source? And what does this projection assume? No change in energy policy?
5) Source? Everything I see shows they are constantly participating.
6) Source? All I've found is a instituteforenergyresearch dot org article saying they're building 1 new one every 7 to 10 days but that's from 2 years ago. I'm finding lots of very recent articles saying they've axed plans for 100 coal plants.
7) Indeed. All the more reason this transition to clean energy will be difficult for them.
8) Well if that's the case it's probably because they're the most populated countries by far. Seriously, the US is in 3rd place and it's way smaller. also, see 4.
9) Not sure what you're saying here. What limit? And if it was passed what does that mean?
10) Again, what are you saying here? People aren't reducing their energy usage?
11) Hard one to prove either way. Over the past few decades there's certainly been a LOT more awareness. And a lightbulb revolution.
12) Celebrities is quite a broad term. There's famous and unfamous assholes everywhere. There's also good people everywhere.

Actually, there's many many water charities. I see Matt Damon talking about one all the time. In fact, I went with that Charity, water dot org, to India to see what they're doing there.

Certainly examples of nonsense in all areas of politics and society. Not sure how this counters The Paris Accord. And I'm not sure vowing to reduce emissions is the first thing they teach you in business school to help you make money.

4. By the year 2030, China will be producing around 45% of the Co2 worldwide.
5. China has declared it is unlikely to enter into any deal even in 2030.
6. China is building four new coal plants per week.
7. China and India are going through an Industrial Revolution.
8. China and India will produce over 60% of the world Co2 by 2030.
9. The Co2 limit was passed over six months ago.
10. No country on the planet is reducing the requirement for energy.

Investing in slowing down climate change can prevent these foreseeable consequences as well as the ones we cannot predict. As to the Paris Agreement, I believe that it was devastatingly terrible that the US retracted from it. Even taking climate change out of it, the Paris Agreement was a beautiful thing as the leaders of the entire planet came together, something that we have never seen before in our history, and agreed on something. I found it truly touching and it made me believe in a better future in which we could all work and live together. Trump states that the other nations were happy because they wanted to see the US economy weakened, which is just so far from what so many people across the globe felt.

1) 'Calculated predictions' mentioned here was completely false and is not based on the UN climate model. The Paris Agreement targets to limit global average temperature increase to less than 1.5C from pre industrial levels.

2) Investment on renewable energy sources,  energy efficiency improvements in building, transportation, and industrial sectors, can actually boost the economy and create more jobs. Most countries, including China and EU are well on their way to meet their promised greenhouse gas reduction targets. Only US and Russia is lagging behind. 

3) Research on more effective renewable energy sources are already underway. BUT we don't have time to wait until they become available. Therefore we have to take the maximum use of current available technologies.

The climate cycles of our water planet are continental glaciers with lower sea levels brought on by Global tsunami's every 13 k years when the Precession of the north star aligns the equator with the solar orbital plane at the ecliptic's.

Global warming is happening because as the axis of the earth continues to tilt towards the sun. More DIRECT sunlight reaches the higher latitudes poles. Warming the southern hemisphere heat sink oceans and thawing the northern hemisphere frozen co2 continents. Which is why temperature rises first and co2 follows. Cause and effect.

Earth is a 4.5 billion year old closed loop that self regulates co2 with LIFE.
Dinosaurs didn't live of off the little bit of co2 unthawed released right now.

Lomborg is not a climate scientist or economist and has published little or no peer-reviewed research on environmental or climate policy.

Better: ""The Current Climate Policies meant to Contribute to Paris Climate Agreement Won't Change the Climate""


The Paris Agreement is not a policy plan to actually lessen climate change. It is a promise by each signing country to contribute to a global effort to keep warming ""well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels"" by ""nationally determined contributions"" (that is, they make their own goals).


It has no legal force and signing countries could just make their own goals really unambitious, and that has been true for the major climate change contributors (China, America). Countries can (and should, if they are to keep to their agreement) make ambitious policies which would change the climate for the better.",0.0,0.0,,47bNzLj5E_Q,

In my personal opinion, the main factor is an urbanization process. Cities characterized by a low albedo factor act as huge accumulators of sun's heat in a daytime, releasing that heat at nighttime. In comparison, a non-urbanized earth's surfaces act differently. High albedo surfaces (ice and clouds)  deflect sun's radiation back into space without heat absorption.

Before global warming became popular I remember a push for a worldwide tax on the rich, and that money would be given to the poor countries. Then after the Berlin Wall fell, a very similar proposal was introduced, ""to prevent global warming"". Somehow just giving money to the poor countries is supposed to fix rising CO² levels. 

Every proposal and agreement since was somehow related to this idea. 

A carbon tax is the same thing. Rich countries pay poor countries because they produce more CO². How does this reduce CO²? The increase in cost will really only result in the costs being passed on to the consumer, hurting the poor the most. Any and all reductions would come at the cost to the economy. And now the Economist who came up with the idea is receiving a Nobel prize in economics. He is being rewarded for creating a scam that either he is fully aware of, or he's just an idiot. Either way he really does not deserve this reward that has become nothing but a political tool.

The Paris Accord is the exact same thing as all these other agreements and ideas pushed by the UN. Make up some number as a goal, don't worry if you hit the goal because nobody really cares, nor is there any enforcement whatsoever. But regardless rich countries give money to the poor countries. Same old Socialism hidden in guise of Climate Change. 

I am convinced that if the US offered to pay poor countries to produce more CO² the UN would jump on that agreement in an instant.

It is the first time in history that countries are willing to globally work towards slowing global warming. However the concern for economical depressions seem more frightening to people than climate change (and the possibility of having the world becoming uninhabitable for humans) does.

However imo that is the whole point of the Agreement, starting to work towards green energy (for both industries and humans). An treaty like the Paris Agreement might seem economically horrifying and unrealistic. But to avoid having an economical coma within the next century, we need to gradually adapt before the prices for energy shoot way up. A great example of this is the artificial increase in the price of tradable emission permits in the EU limiting tradable emission permits - something the EU is striving towards with effective long term policies. 

However, the way I view it, is that generally a lot of American are against the agreement because they are afraid they are gonna 'lose' money. This is something that will definitely be the case if their companies do not start adapting right now, because they will get behind on new environmental friendly technologies. These technologies are technologies that will be subsidized and on the contrary polluting (conservative) technologies will be the ones that are gonna raise in price. It's kind of like Kodak, as they were completely missing digitalization in the photography world and went bankrupt afterward.

Aside all the wit, it is rather remarkable that a country that is as 'economically wealthy' as the United States of America, is willing to spend half of their budget on military expenses does not care for the environment. After all that might be simply because robbing unstable countries of their raw materials is an easy way to get money, if you invest half your budget on it already. In the end you might ask yourself what the value of money is, if you are willing to sell the environment (thus your offspring and the entire world) just to last the economy another couple decades until the next financial crisis beats the shit out of it.

Legally, the US can't back out of the Paris Agreement at this current time. The US is able to formally announce its withdrawal in 2019 and then we have to wait a year until the withdrawal is official.

The Paris Agreement just states that every country should do something about global warming. There were no binding terms that a country should do this or do that. You can be in the agreement and do absolutely nothing about global warming. 

The Paris Agreement is important because environmental protection has always been on the political back burner and no one really wanted to touch on it. With this, most of the world has finally come to terms with agreeing to pick up their shit from human activities. 

A lot of people think that environmental protection is a waste of tax dollars for reasons like it won't help or you can use it for something better. Honestly, I think that the Earth is on the point of no return. I don't ever see us finding a way to fix the ozone layer or to fix global warming. Most carbon emissions are from the burning of fuels which covers a variety of different areas (burning of fuel to make electricity, for automobiles, industrial processes, the list goes on).

So are the entirety of all Global Warming alarmist projections. The fact is that if the US stopped producing energy from sources like Coal, tomorrow, it would not be a significant enough change to matter. As human populations grow and meat consumption increases (the emissions from humans and livestock), the CO2 in the atmosphere would STILL climb. Further, unless you can stop wars, which no one, least of all the US, seems to be able to do, we will see huge emissions from those conflicts. Nevermind that surges in volcanic activity, such as what was seen in 1998, can and will have far greater effect on the various ""greenhouse gas"" levels and global temperatures than anything we can do. We have no way of predicting or controlling volcanoes, nor can we dictate to China that they stop producing CO2, and we certainly can't go about killing off the population just to lower CO2 emissions.

Paris climate agreement may not be technically a law but everything that it represents will cost the United States taxpayer money and will be a major change in how our money is soent and when it comes to my money I should have a say so and how it is spent. 
it is innovation that drives technology and lower CO² emissions not a form of Socialism that is imposed on a society.  At this current time we all contribute to global warming and there is no way to stop the from happening. here is 7.5 billion+ and we are still a growing population. We all want to eat and most of us want to have a somewhat comfortable life style that energy consumption brings. Unless someone figures out how to make a fusion reactor in our lifetime the whole world depends on fossil fuels in one form or another.  Also if you look at the USA as a whole our energy consumption is about the he same as the he rest of the world and and that wasn't with a bunk agreement but because of innovation and technology copying.  Things like LED light bulbs reduce our CO² and they were made in the USA and then the lightbulb was made in Japan and together the innovative idea is reducing our energy needs. if we are lowering our energy consumption as consumers it should cost us less money not more that is what makes the Paris a climate agreement wrong because it renders technology that we have now irrelevant even though it's still has life in it such as a coal-fired power plant that may still have 20 or 30 years of use left in it as an example.

List of scientific organizations without a Political Agenda 
1. American Association for the Advancement of Science - 
""The scientific evidence is clear: global climate change caused by human activities is occurring now, and it is a growing threat to society."" 
2. U.S. Global Change Research Program
""The global warming of the past 50 years is due primarily to human-induced increases in heat-trapping gases. Human 'fingerprints' also have been identified in many other aspects of the climate system, including changes in ocean heat content, precipitation, atmospheric moisture, and Arctic sea ice."" (2009, 13 U.S. government departments and agencies). 
3. American Chemical Society - 
""Comprehensive scientific assessments of our current and potential future climates clearly indicate that climate change is real, largely attributable to emissions from human activities, and potentially a very serious problem."" 
4. American Geophysical Union
""Human‐induced climate change requires urgent action. Humanity is the major influence on the global climate change observed over the past 50 years. Rapid societal responses can significantly lessen negative outcomes. 
5. American Medical Association -
""Our AMA ... supports the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s fourth assessment report and concurs with the scientific consensus that the Earth is undergoing adverse global climate change and that anthropogenic contributions are significant.
6. American Meteorological Society -
""It is clear from extensive scientific evidence that the dominant cause of the rapid change in climate of the past half century is human-induced increases in the amount of atmospheric greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide (CO2), chlorofluorocarbons, methane, and nitrous oxide.""
7. American Physical Society -
""The evidence is incontrovertible: Global warming is occurring. If no mitigating actions are taken, significant disruptions in the Earth’s physical and ecological systems, social systems, security and human health are likely to occur. We must reduce emissions of greenhouse gases beginning now."" 
8. The Geological Society of America
""The Geological Society of America (GSA) concurs with assessments by the National Academies of Science (2005), the National Research Council (2006), and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2007) that global climate has warmed and that human activities (mainly greenhouse‐gas emissions) account for most of the warming since the middle 1900s."" 
9. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
“Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia. The atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, and sea level has risen.

“Human influence on the climate system is clear, and recent anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases are the highest in history. Recent climate changes have had widespread impacts on human and natural systems.

Or how this video's pseudoscience and far right leaning opinions posed as intellectual thought, without providing logical arguments or credibility. Where are all the Facts?

Please go watch Milo or Ben because your the minority, Yes you are the overwhelming minority so you come to the internet to try your hardest to find exile with Steven crowder or Alex jones...Give it time and you Reactionaries will all die. The entire world has caught on to climate change
The planet's average surface temperature has risen about 2.0 degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide and other human-made emissions into the atmosphere.5 Most of the warming occurred in the past 35 years, with 16 of the 17 warmest years on record occurring since 2001. Not only was 2016 the warmest year on record, but eight of the 12 months that make up the year — from January through September, with the exception of June — were the warmest on record for those respective months. Glaciers are retreating almost everywhere around the world — including in the Alps, Himalayas, Andes, Rockies, Alaska and Africa. Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the acidity of surface ocean waters has increased by about 30 percent.11,12 This increase is the result of humans emitting more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and hence more being absorbed into the oceans. The amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by the upper layer of the oceans is increasing by about 2 billion tons per year",11.0,1.0,,47bNzLj5E_Q,

In a peer-reviewed research paper published in June of this year, researchers revealed that the global warming trend causing so much fear is NOT AN ACCURATE REPRESENTATION OF THE DATA. In fact, they discovered the major organizations (NASA, NOAA, and Hadley CRU) have been colluding and falsifying data instead of publishing their true measurements. In other words, whenever their temperature measurements did not support the global warming theory, they threw their measurements out the window and invented new data that conveniently justified the theory.

This new discovery needs to dominate the conversation about climate change!

Currently we are returning to that already thankfully, with tree growth 70% faster in Europe, the sahara desert is being predicted to become green again, America has more trees now then it did 100 years ago, and the world is now 20-25% greener according to satelite imagery.
CO2 emissions are good for the environment.
Besides, if people really wanted to combat CO2 emissions, all we would need is 1.3 trillion more trees to absorb the annual 40 billion tonnes of CO2.

Everything you use in your life is carbon-based,  the food you eat is made with petrochemical fertilizers, the clothes you wear are either grown from Petro chemical fertilizers or made from petrochemicals, the concrete that you are probably standing on at this current moment releases tons of CO2 into the atmosphere both in the manufacturing of it and it's set up it is the largest producer of co² and you can't change its chemical reaction, it s the corner stone in modern society, for that matter, the lumber in your house was made from tools that run on petrochemicals. the steel in the nails was refined using petrochemicals in the form of coal  to melt the iron ore. the rare earth minerals in your tablet, your computer and your smartphone where made using petrochemicals and strip mining destroyed large carbon sequestering natural environments. The only real way to reduce carbon dioxide emissions is a reduction in our population (I don't see that happening) and going back to the hunter-gatherer days  at this current time in technology there is literally no answer to get rid of us using carbon.  Contrary to popular belief there is no such thing as a carbon neutral product because one way or another a fossil fuel was involved in either the growing of it the harvesting of it the shipping of it or the buying of it.  
Innovation is the key to a future with less carbon we in the United States have tripled in our population since roughly World War II yet are carbon emissions haven't grown and that is because of  technology, not the federal government intervening in a form of socialism and imposing huge taxes on a population that had no say in it.

The subsides for buying an electric car will encourage companies to make more electric cars which would otherwise be too expensive to sell. Incremental steps, we can't expect a new technology to suddenly emerge which is radically better than what we have and then everybody will happily switch. Improvements have to be incremental, and subsidies that make them commercially viable are really helpful in the early days of a technology. Also, a sudden shift from fossil fuel energy systems to clean energy is not possible and has to be gradual too, the systems necessary to accommodate billions of people can't be set up overnight. We can't wait for that revolutionary new technology to come up and not do anything until then. 

Just another doubt, according to the graphs you showed, have you assumed that the carbon emissions levels for US will not reduce any further after 2030? And that the rest of the world's emission will also be following the exact same rate as it was before, except starting from a lower point in 2030? Is that realistic?

Futhermore, the sources that DiarreahU posted refer to a college-level study which suggest that the Paris Trade Agreement would not actually reduce emissions is based on a totally different context.

They are referring to the windmills and other green-tech that countries are obliged to make in order to reduce C02 emissions, but the real reason why everyone's scared is something that DiarreahU AGAIN forgot to mention. It's because we're all afraid Trump is going to fart out nuclear plants like there's no tomorrow and his promises to increase coal production will add so much C02 emissions to the atmosphere that it will likely create a large increase in global warming damages during his term.

That we're completely ignoring the potential, connection between carbon dioxide, the Earth's atmosphere, the greenhouse effect, global temperatures, ocean acidification, and sea-level rise. From a long-term point of view, we'd still need to plan for our energy future. Fossil fuels, which make up by far the majority of world-wide power today, are an abundant but fundamentally limited resource. Renewable sources like wind, solar, and hydroelectric power have different limitations: they're inconsistent. There is a long-term solution, though, that overcomes all of these problems: nuclear fusion. 
It might seem that the fossil fuel problem is obvious: we cannot simply generate more coal, oil, or natural gas when our present supplies run out. We've been burning pretty much every drop we can get our hands on for going on three centuries now, and this problem is going to get worse. Even though we have hundreds of years more before we're all out, the amount isn't limitless. There are legitimate, non-warming-related environmental concerns, too. On the other hand, renewable energy sources are inconsistent, even at their best. Try powering your grid during dry, overcast (or overnight), and drought-riddled times, and you're doomed to failure. The sheer magnitude of the battery storage capabilities required to power even a single city during insufficient energy-generation conditions is daunting. Simultaneously, the pollution effects associated with creating solar panels, manufacturing wind or hydroelectric turbines, and (especially) with creating the materials needed to store large amounts of energy are tremendous as well. Even what's touted as ""green energy"" isn't devoid of drawbacks. So far, fission has taken place in either a runaway or controlled environment, rushing past the breakeven point (where the energy output is greater than the input) with ease, while fusion has never reached the breakeven point in a controlled setting. But four main possibilities have emerged.
First, Inertial Confinement Fusion. We take a pellet of hydrogen — the fuel for this fusion reaction — and compress it using many lasers that surround the pellet. The compression causes the hydrogen nuclei to fuse into heavier elements like helium, and releases a burst of energy
Second, Magnetic Confinement Fusion. Instead of using mechanical compression, why not let the electromagnetic force do the confining work? Magnetic fields confine a superheated plasma of fusible material, and nuclear fusion reactions occur inside a Tokamak-style reactor.
Next, Magnetized Target Fusion. In MTF, a superheated plasma is created and confined magnetically, but pistons surrounding it compress the fuel inside, creating a burst of nuclear fusion in the interior.
Finally, Subcritical Fusion. Instead of trying to trigger fusion with heat or inertia, subcritical fusion uses a subcritical fission reaction -- with zero chance of a meltdown -- to power a fusion reaction.
The first two have been researched for decades now, and are the closest to the coveted breakeven point. But the latter two are new, with the last one gaining many new investors and start-ups this decade.
Even if I reject climate religion, the problem of powering the world, and doing so in a sustainable, pollution-free way, is one of the most daunting long-term ones facing humanity. Nuclear fusion as a power source has never been given the necessary funding to develop it to fruition, but it's the one physically possible solution to our energy needs with no obvious downsides. If we can get the idea that ""nuclear"" means ""potential for disaster"" out of our heads, people from all across the political spectrum just might be able to come together and solve our energy and environmental needs in one single blow. If you think the government should be investing in science with national and global payoffs, you can't do better than the ROI that would come from successful fusion research. The physics works out beautifully; we now just need the investment and the engineering breakthroughs. 
If you read the whole post I appreciate it and I'd like to have a real debate about this without being called a sociopathic murderer because i think its important for things to actually be efficient i.e. PROFITABLE. Believe me if these green renewable energies were truly efficient then guys like Zuckerberg, Soros, Bill Gates and many Hollywood players would be investing in them.

First of all, where are the sources? That's really sketchy. Also $1 trillion per year!?!? I can't find that anywhere. Even Donald Trump said 3 trillion total and that's probably on the high end. As to the drop in temperature, if we are able to lower the temperature by 0.3 degrees every 14 years, that is pretty good. That means if in 2030 the countries decided to continue at the same rate we would postpone the effects of global warming by 24 years and lower the temperature by about 1 degree Celsius from where we would be without it which is pretty amazing, even using their likely low figures. Also, we do need to invest in green energy and the Paris Climate Accord creates a market for it so it will keep improving meaning that we can start doing much more to prevent the terrible effects of climate change.

What a stupid sentence of course it does not, that our emission do change climate is by far bad enough, so a political debate should not increase more the anthropogenic climate change.
1. The Paris Climate Agreement is there to save us from extinction and not to change the climate
2. The Paris Climate Agreement is there to stop the climate to change and to stop emission which do change the climate and not to change the climate of course !!! And yes it is that simple everyone with primary school education can grasp that fact. A bit later in the movie you do even talk about the reductions in detail by your self, you can not be that stupid ?  
3. The reduction in Temp is clear will only take a long time, because we did emit already for the next coming 20 years and more and depends on the emissions that can be reduced, what never happen till now, we got a world wide emission rise till today.
4. LOL what it does cost, climate impact are much more expensive even today and not to loose everything is all the money worth we got.
5. Only less reduction, is much better then the rapid global temp rise we have today, what will speak clearly for a world wide economical collapse in a few decades and a world wide mass-extinction.
6. LOL Fracking is not a green energy you idiot !!!! And it will not reduce by the rising needs of energy the emissions of course, what the hell is wrong with you ? School drop out, where is that lack of education coming from  ?",0.0,0.0,,47bNzLj5E_Q,

The prime reason you model is to see if you understand the underlying physics controlling a complex system. People think that we know basic physics and so this should be straightforward. This is not true for complex systems. Complex systems have a vast number of inputs and interactions making them chaotic and hard to analyze. Nova had an excellent show many years ago about climate change and its effects. My take on this show was that we are lacking high resolution data regardless  on how complex our models are. But again the purpose of these models is to see if the simplifications we have made are realistic.

1) I have seen that popular video when people literally burn water running from a tap. Later it was proved to be a liberal fake (made by Mr. Steven Lipsky  under advice of Ms. Alisa Rich), as they connected a gas tank to the pipe. 
2) fracking by itself doesnt cause pollution of upper ground layers of surface, it also doesnt pollute water. Even conventional oil/gas well can cause  that if the borehole's walls are not good. Leakage of gas/chemicals may happen then. But it doesn't matter if we have fracking or not!
3) fracking has been used for 60 years already and nobody cared until horizontal drilling was introduced. Its not something absolutely new, nothing to be afraid.
4) there was no case when oil/gas company was officially found guilty in poisoning of water because of fracking.

Quiggin observed that Lomborg had argued in his controversial book The Skeptical Environmentalist that resources allocated to mitigating global warming would be better spent on improving water quality and sanitation, and was therefore seen as having prejudged the issues.

Under the heading ""Wrong Question"", Sachs further argued that: ""The panel that drew up the Copenhagen Consensus was asked to allocate an additional US$50 billion in spending by wealthy countries, distributed over five years, to address the world’s biggest problems. This was a poor basis for decision-making and for informing the public. By choosing such a low sum — a tiny fraction of global income — the project inherently favoured specific low-cost schemes over bolder, larger projects. It is therefore no surprise that the huge and complex challenge of long-term climate change was ranked last, and that scaling up health services in poor countries was ranked lower than interventions against specific diseases, despite warnings in the background papers that such interventions require broader improvements in health services.""",0.0,0.0,,47bNzLj5E_Q,

Even if electric cars uses 100% energy from co2 sources (which is not the case), they reduce the amount of co2 in the air anyway because they are way more efficient (85% efficiency + regenerative breaking Vs 25% efficiency of oil cars), also.. thermal fossil plants are way more efficient than car engines, they achieve around 50% of efficiency, meanwhile, again.. your car only achieves 25%.
You said that range did not increase with batteries?  Before: 50km, now 400km at affordable cost.
Tesla S is the best car of all the world in its range cost, no matter if you dont care about polluting, no other car provide the same pros than tesla at that price.  The same will happen for tesla 3, it will become in the best car at 35000$.
Then you have fuel cell vehicles, that they will solve the range and charge issue that batteries can not solve.
Solar and wind reduce their cost by a 70% to 85% in 7 years, fuel cell cars the same, batteries cars the same, they continue dropping in cost.

Are you assuming age? Intelligence and age are two factors that should not be put together. I could be ten and still be more intelligent than the majority of people.

To top it off, you assume I don't have qualifications? I may not have a PhD but my qualifications are high enough to school your ass.

""They"" the media and leftist crooked politicians, opened their eyes for the first time in 1969 about a topic that scientists have known about since John Tyndall, in 1859, discovered that CO2 and many other gases blocked infrared radiation. He (John Tyndall) first mentioned that the potential change in atmospheric makeup could bring about climate change. The first publication with the calculations for climate change were published in 1896 by Svante Arrhenius. The evidence to support their claims have been stacking up exponentially since. So no, my standings are not from ""media bias"" or ""propaganda"" that has been ""polluting"" the world since 1970. People (smart people) are buying into it because they can see the evidence on climate change continuing to stack up.

""Climategate"" has no standing, The climatic research unit is one of many climate research facilities which all say the same thing, global warming is happening. Plus scientists from everywhere else have backed up claims that the email leaking at CRU holds no grounds on the actual evidence for global warming. It is pretty damn easy to see, what with the rising sea levels, the decline in glaciers, and decrease in arctic sea ice.

Did you know politicians used misdirection in the early 1900's to lead people to believe climate change had no standing? aaaand did you know everything in that last sentence has backed evidence? Often skeptics use the same standings today as they did back then and yet the evidence is present against their arguments. The problem is that, in science there is an unspoken rule that nothing can be more then 99.99% accurate and skeptics like to take advantage of that. (now lets watch you try to take advantage of that, go on, prove me right).

I have talked to Geologists who hold PhD's as well as Dr's in Chemistry Physics and even Human nutrition. They are all aware of the fluctuations of the earths temperatures as am I. They know global warming is happening and they agree with me. Or more correctly, it is I who agree with them. Global warming is happening whether you want to believe it or not.

The first is that trees (and all plants) are made of carbon and while that carbon is stored in the plants it is not in the atmosphere.  Living trees are a large carbon sink while they are alive. Clearing forests results in more carbon in the atmosphere simply because it isn't being taken out of the atmosphere and turned into wood. Humans have altered the closed loop by clearing forests.

The second is that trees (and other plants) do die and rot but not all of them end up rotting. Some of them can stay in place as wood for hundreds of years. Some of them turn into coal, some into oil and some into gas depending on where they died and what processes they end up going through. Eventually the coal, oil and gas reaches a volcano and re-enters the atmosphere, but once again, humans have massively sped up this process, altering the closed loop so that much more of the carbon is currently in the atmopshere as CO2.

There's also another big CO2 sink other than plants: chemical weathering.  CO2 dissolves in rivers forming carbonic acid. The carbonic acid eats away at limestone, forming calcium carbonate and the calcium carbonate ends up in deposits of chalk and the shells of sea creatures. Thankfully humans don't seem to have altered this one.",1.0,1.0,,47bNzLj5E_Q,

The Paris agreement is a giant step towards battling global warming. It was the first time that the entire world was united in tackling climate change (Syria and Nicaragua were the only countries that didn't sign it, the former because of its horrific civil war and the latter as it argued it didn't go far enough for rich countries). 

But here's the thing,the agreement had no way to enforce countries in any way and each country would set its own goals. And while you could argue that more needs to be done towards climate change, the Paris agreement is at least a step forward in that direction. And the costs do not outway the benefits as that figure of $1-2 trillion yearly is the total cost for all 195 countries, the US has only to provide $3 billion dollars and has already given $1 billion. Even when you compare it to other countries the value of the money given compared to GDP the US comes just 32nd. 

Oh and I'm not sure where you got 0.023*F reduction from (is that just for the US?) because the aim of the paris agreement is get the global temperature increase to at least below 2*C (35.6*F) and to aim for 1.5*C (34.7*F). While the temperature between 1800 to now has risen by 2*C so I think that's a pretty good starting point. 

So the fact that the US may be pulling out of the climate change following yet another atrocious decision made by that utter arsehole Donald Drumpf could have serious repercussions. So if you truly believe that the Paris agreement doesn't go far enough in tackling climate change as you have argued in this video then come up with another way the entire world could tackle climate change or at the very least, raise awareness of this very important issue.",0.0,0.0,,47bNzLj5E_Q,

I personally believe that humans aren't a big factor in climate change and that other factors are the cause. For example: Variations in the amount of energy received from the sun as well as variations in the earth's orbit around the sun. Studies show that 60-70% of the suns energy gets through to the earth with the rest being reflected into space after hitting earth's upper atmosphere, but variations in the sun's characteristics from time to time can cause changes in earth's global energy balance (changes climate). Changes in the tilt of the earth's axis, eccentricity, and shifting of the equinoxes (i.e. precession) have major roles in determining variations in the amount of the sun's energy reaching the earth (changes climate). Another example could be the oceans on earth. Oceans store heat efficiently, transporting it thousands of miles, redistributing heat in time and space. The oceans and marine life also consume huge amounts of carbon dioxide. These ocean based processes exert tremendous influence on global climate. Another example, continental drift. Scientists believe this constant drifting impacts the climate because it changes the physical features of the landmass, their position and the position of water bodies. It also changes the flow of the ocean currents and winds, which affects the climate. I can go on, but my point is how do we know that the earths climate change is being heavily affected by humans if people go around calling people questioning their logic as climate ""deniers"" to shut down the conversation?",0.0,0.0,,47bNzLj5E_Q,

3 February 2015 - The Top UN Climate Change Official is optimistic that a new international treaty will be adopted at Paris Climate Change conference at the end of the year. However the official, Christiana Figueres, the Executive Secretary of UNFCCC, warns that the fight against climate change is a process and that the necessary transformation of the world economy will not be decided at one conference or in one agreement.

'THIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST DIFFICULT TASK WE HAVE EVER GIVEN OURSELVES, WHICH IS TO INTENTIONALLY TRANSFORM THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT MODEL, FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HUMAN HISTORY' (emphasis added), Ms Figueres stated at a press conference in Brussels.

Open quote.
Why did Ottmar Edenhofer, the UN IPCC official, say, ""We redistribute de facto the world's wealth by climate policy,” when discussing climate change?

Here’s the context of Edenhofer’s comments (emphasis mine) :
(EDENHOFER): Basically it's a big mistake to discuss climate policy separately from the major themes of globalization. The climate summit in Cancun at the end of the month is not a climate conference, but one of the largest economic conferences since the Second World War. Why? Because WE HAVE 11,000 GIGATONS OF CARBON IN THE COAL RESERVES IN THE SOIL UNDER OUR FEET - AND WE MUST EMIT ONLY 400 GIGATONS IN THE ATMOSPHERE IF WE WANT TO KEEP THE 2-DEGREE TARGET. 11 000 TO 400 - THERE IS NO GETTING AROUND THE FACT THAT MOST OF THE FOSSIL RESERVES MUST REMAIN IN THE SOIL.

(NZZ AM SONNTAG): DE FACTO, THIS MEANS AN EXPROPRIATION OF THE COUNTRIES WITH NATURAL RESOURCES. This leads to a very different development from that which has been triggered by development policy.

(EDENHOFER): First of all, DEVELOPED COUNTRIES HAVE BASICALLY EXPROPRIATED THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE WORLD COMMUNITY. BUT ONE MUST SAY CLEARLY THAT WE REDISTRIBUTE DE FACTO THE WORLD'S WEALTH BY CLIMATE POLICY. Obviously, the owners of coal and oil will not be enthusiastic about this. One has to free oneself from the illusion that international climate policy is environmental policy. This has almost nothing to do with environmental policy anymore, with problems such as deforestation or the ozone hole.

http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexepstein/2015/01/06/97-of-climate-scientists-agree-is-100-wrong/print/


If you’ve ever expressed the least bit of skepticism about environmentalist calls for making the vast majority of fossil fuel use illegal, you’ve probably heard the smug response: “97% of climate scientists agree with climate change” — which always carries the implication: Who are you to challenge them? The answer is: you are a thinking, independent individual–and you don’t go by polls, let alone second-hand accounts of polls; you go by facts, logic and explanation. Here are two questions to ask anyone who pulls the 97% trick. 1. What exactly do the climate scientists agree on? Usually, the person will have a very vague answer like “climate change is real.” Which raises the question: What is that supposed to mean? That climate changes? That we have some impact? That we have a large impact? That we have a catastrophically large impact? That we have such a catastrophic impact that we shouldn’t use fossil fuels? What you’ll find is that people don’t want to define what 97% agree on–because there is nothing remotely in the literature saying 97% agree we should ban most fossil fuel use. 

It’s likely that 97% of people making the 97% claim have absolutely no idea where that number comes from. If you look at the literature, the specific meaning of the 97% claim is: 97 percent of climate scientists agree that there is a global warming trend and that human beings are the main cause–that is, that we are over 50% responsible. The warming is a whopping 0.8 degrees over the past 150 years, a warming that has tapered off to essentially nothing in the last decade and a half.

Even if 97% of climate scientists agreed with this, and even if they were right, it in no way, shape, or form would imply that we should restrict fossil fuels–which are crucial to the livelihood of billions. 

Because the actual 97% claim doesn’t even remotely justify their policies, catastrophists like President Obama and John Kerry take what we could generously call creative liberties in repeating this claim.

On his Twitter account, President Obama tweets: “Ninety-seven percent of scientists agree: #climate change is real, man-made and dangerous.” Not only does Obama sloppily equate “scientists” with “climate scientists,” but more importantly he added “dangerous” to the 97% claim, which is not there in the literature.

This is called the fallacy of equivocation: using the same term (“97 percent”) in two different ways to manipulate people.

John Kerry pulled the same stunt when trying to tell the underdeveloped world that it should use fewer fossil fuels:

“ And let there be no doubt in anybody’s mind that the science is absolutely certain. . . 97 percent of climate scientists have confirmed that climate change is happening and that human activity is responsible. . . . . they agree that, if we continue to go down the same path that we are going down today, the world as we know it will change—and it will change dramatically for the worse.

In Kerry’s mind, 97% of climate scientists said whatever Kerry wants them to have said.

Bottom line: What the 97% of climate scientists allegedly agree on is very mild and in no way justifies restricting the energy that billions need. But it gets even worse.

Because it turns out that 97% didn’t even say that. Which brings us to the next question:

How do we know the 97% agree?

To elaborate, how was that proven?

Almost no one who refers to the 97% has any idea, but the basic way it works is that a researcher reviews a lot of scholarly papers and classifies them by how many agree with a certain position.

Unfortunately, in the case of 97% of climate scientists agreeing that human beings are the main cause of warming, the researchers have engaged in egregious misconduct.

One of the main papers behind the 97 percent claim is authored by John Cook, who runs the popular website SkepticalScience.com, a virtual encyclopedia of arguments trying to defend predictions of catastrophic climate change from all challenges.

Here is Cook’s summary of his paper: “Cook et al. (2013) found that over 97 percent [of papers he surveyed] endorsed the view that the Earth is warming up and human emissions of greenhouse gases are the main cause.”

This is a fairly clear statement—97 percent of the papers surveyed endorsed the view that manmade greenhouse gases were the main cause— main in common usage meaning more than 50 percent.

But even a quick scan of the paper reveals that this is not the case. Cook is able to demonstrate only that a relative handful endorse “the view that the Earth is warming up and human emissions of greenhouse gases are the main cause.” Cook calls this “explicit endorsement with quantification” (quantification meaning 50 percent or more). The problem is, only a small percentage of the papers fall into this category; Cook does not say what percentage, but when the study was publicly challenged by economist David Friedman, one observer calculated that only 1.6 percent explicitly stated that man-made greenhouse gases caused at least 50 percent of global warming.

Where did most of the 97 percent come from, then? Cook had created a category called “explicit endorsement without quantification”—that is, papers in which the author, by Cook’s admission, did not say whether 1 percent or 50 percent or 100 percent of the warming was caused by man. He had also created a category called “implicit endorsement,” for papers that imply (but don’t say) that there is some man made global warming and don’t quantify it. In other words, he created two categories that he labeled as endorsing a view that they most certainly didn’t.

The 97 percent claim is a deliberate misrepresentation designed to intimidate the public—and numerous scientists whose papers were classified by Cook protested:

“Cook survey included 10 of my 122 eligible papers. 5/10 were rated incorrectly. 4/5 were rated as endorse rather than neutral.”
—Dr. Richard Tol

“That is not an accurate representation of my paper . . .” —Dr. Craig Idso “Nope . . . it is not an accurate representation.”
—Dr. Nir Shaviv

“That is not an accurate representation of my paper . . .”
—Dr. Craig Idso

“Cook et al. (2013) is based on a strawman argument . . .”
—Dr. Nicola Scafetta

Think about how many times you hear that 97 percent or some similar figure thrown around. It’s based on crude manipulation propagated by people whose ideological agenda it serves. It is a license to intimidate.",1.0,1.0,,47bNzLj5E_Q,

Examining the Scientific Consensus on Climate Change

Survey was sent to 10,257 Earth scientists asking two questions:
1. When compared with pre-1800s levels, do you think that mean global temperatures have generally risen, fallen, or remained relatively constant?
2. Do you think human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures?  (Significant defined as 50% or more)

3146 individuals completed the survey, 30.7%

79 individuals specialized in climate science, or 0.77%.

76 answered risen to the first question and yes to the second, or 0.74%.

In other words, out of 10,257 scientist who would have knowledge of climate science because it affects all the other earth sciences to some degree, 7,111 did not think the two question survey was worth taking and only 76 believe humans are causing the change.

Climate Consensus and ‘Misinformation’: A Rejoinder to Agnotology, Scientific Consensus, and the Teaching and Learning of Climate Change
Abstract:
""Agnotology is the study of how ignorance arises via circulation of misinformation calculated to mislead. Legates et al. (Sci Educ 22:2007–2017, 2013) had questioned the applicability of agnotology to politically-charged debates. In their reply, Bedford and Cook (Sci Educ 22:2019–2030, 2013), seeking to apply agnotology to climate science, asserted that fossil-fuel interests had promoted doubt about a climate consensus. Their definition of climate ‘misinformation’ was contingent upon the post-modernist assumptions that scientific truth is discernible by measuring a consensus among experts, and that a near unanimous consensus exists. However, inspection of a claim by Cook et al. (Environ Res Lett 8:024024, 2013) of 97.1% consensus, heavily relied upon by Bedford and Cook, shows just 0.3% endorsement of the standard definition of consensus: that most warming since 1950 is anthropogenic. Agnotology, then, is a two-edged sword since either side in a debate may claim that general ignorance arises from misinformation allegedly circulated by the other. Significant questions about anthropogenic influences on climate remain. Therefore, Legates et al. appropriately asserted that partisan presentations of controversies stifle debate and have no place in education.""",0.0,1.0,,47bNzLj5E_Q,

Approximately 1,100 years ago during the 9th century the climate entered what is called the Medieval Warming period. During this warming period the global climate warmed enough that a large part of Greenland was actually green and was colonized by the Viking people who grew crops and tended herds of grazing animals (Hancock and Brian 613-617).  Agriculture in Europe thrived as the growing season grew longer and crops could be grown further north (Hancock and Brian 666).  Humanity's standard of living steadily improved for centuries as the food supply continued to increase with the warming climate.  Global warming continued until sometime in the 13th or 14th century when the Medieval Warming period transformed into the Medieval Cooling Period (also know as the dark ages).  When the climate started cooling, agriculture production started to fall and there was not enough food to feed the people or their herd animals.  The Vikings were forced to abandon their Greenland colony and turn to raiding to survive (Wallace 16-24).  In Europe, people starved and diseases were rampant.  A plague was responsible for the death of nearly 25% of the know population of the earth (Hancock and Brian 613-617).

ABSTRACT:
The processes controlling the carbon flux and carbon storage of the atmosphere, ocean and terrestrial biosphere are temperature sensitive and are likely to provide a positive feedback leading to amplified anthropogenic warming. Owing to this feedback, at timescales ranging from interannual to the 20-100-kyr cycles of Earth's orbital variations, WARMING OF THE CLIMATE SYSTEM CAUSES A NET RELEASE OF CO2 INTO THE ATMOSPHERE; THIS IN TURN AMPLIFIES WARMING. BUT THE MAGNITUDE OF THE CLIMATE SENSITIVITY OF THE GLOBAL CARBON CYCLE (TERMED y), AND THUS OF ITS POSITIVE FEEDBACK STRENGTH, IS UNDER DEBATE, GIVING RISE TO LARGE UNCERTAINTIES IN GLOBAL WARMING PROJECTIONS (emphasis added).

Here we quantify the median y as 7.7 p.p.m.v. CO2 per degree Celsius warming, with a likely range of 1.7-21.4 p.p.m.v. CO2 per degree Celsius. Sensitivity experiments exclude significant influence of pre-industrial land-use change on these estimates. Our results, based on the coupling of a probabilistic approach with an ensemble of proxy-based temperature reconstructions and pre-industrial CO2 data from three ice cores, provide robust constraints for y on the policy-relevant multi-decadal to centennial timescales. By using an ensemble of greater than 200,000 members, quantification of y is not only improved, but also likelihoods can be assigned, thereby providing a benchmark for future model simulations. Although uncertainties do not at present allow exclusion of y calculated from any of ten coupled carbon-climate models, we find that y is about twice as likely to fall in the lowermost than in the uppermost quartile of their range. OUR RESULTS ARE INCOMPATIBLY LOWER (P GREATER THAN 0.05) THAN RECENT PRE-INDUSTRIAL EMPIRICAL ESTIMATES OF 40 P.P.M.V. CO2 PER DEGREE CELSIUS, AND CORRESPONDINGLY SUGGEST 80% LESS POTENTIAL AMPLIFICATION OF ONGOING GLOBAL WARMING (emphasis added).

Open quote.
Around 15,000 years ago, the Earth started warming abruptly after ~ 100,000 years of an ""ice age""; this is known as a glacial termination. The large ice sheets, which covered significant parts of North America and Europe, began melting as a result. A climatic optimum known as the ""Bölling-Allerød"" was reached shortly thereafter, around 14,700 before present. However, starting at about 12,800 BP, the Earth returned very quickly into near glacial conditions (i.e. cold, dry and windy), and stayed there for about 1,200 years: this is known as the Younger Dryas (YD), since it is the most recent interval where a plant characteristic of cold climates, Dryas Octopetala, was found in Scandinavia.

The most spectacular aspect of the YD is that it ended extremely abruptly (around 11,600 years ago), and although the date cannot be known exactly, it is estimated from the annually-banded Greenland ice-core that the ANNUAL-MEAN TEMPERATURE INCREASED BY AS MUCH AS 10°C IN 10 YEARS (emphasis added).

I wonder how humans dumping CO2 caused such a rapid climate change 11,600 years ago. Maybe humans are so powerful they found a way to send our CO2 back through time into the past. That might explain the sudden current slowdown in warming the globe has been seen the past 15 plus years.

http://ossfoundation.us/projects/environment/global-warming/natural-cycle#section-7

Yes, historical evidence shows that the earth’s climate has made both major and minor warming/cooling fluctuations and in a fairly predictable pattern for the last 450,000 years.  The debate here is not whether the climate is changing or not, but whether humans are responsible for the change and what can be done about it.

 If you look at the charts, you will see that major/minor climate change has happen for hundreds of thousands of years before humanity was in any position to have an effect on the climate, but does that mean that humanity is having no effect on the current climate change?  The truth is that all living things have an effect on the environment around them, to say otherwise would be foolish, but when you look at the big picture it is obvious that humanities effect on the climate amounts to a pimple on the buttocks of the world and there is nothing that we can do that will stop it.  The best we can do now is to start to adapt, so we do not end up like humanity did during the last little ice age when a quarter of the population in Europe died of the plague.

 The most important question about this debate is why humans are being blamed for it?  The answer to that question can be found in the human caused global warming proponents answer to the problem, giving government the power to dictate how we live our lives.

New Ice Age coming?

An eminent climatologist has broken with long-held theories of past ice ages and, on the basis of new evidence, now believes that the world may be in for some uncomfortable climate in the relative near future.  Dr. Ceseare Emiliami, a professor at the University of Miami's Rosensteil School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, fears a new ice age could come in 2000 or 3000 years, or even earlier if man's contribution to climate changes – through pollution, deforestation, and other means – should alter the present balance.

Chilling Possibilities

By contrast, the weather in the first part of this century has been the warmest and best for world agriculture in over a millennium, and, partly as a result, the world's population has more than doubled. Since 1940, however, the temperature of the Northern Hemisphere has been steadily falling: Having risen about 1.1 degrees C.  between 1885 and 1940, according to one estimation, the temperature has already fallen back some 0.6  degrees, and shows no signs of reversal. Specific areas, of course, may experience changes markedly different from the average. During the warming period, temperatures in parts of Norway rose five times more than the hemisphere average, and since the cooling trend began again, Iceland's temperature has dropped nearly 2.0 degrees, threatening continued existence of some crops.",0.0,1.0,,47bNzLj5E_Q,

They also accuse those who dispute that humans are THE cause of global cooling/warming/climate change are denying that the climate is changing and are science deniers.

Some people approach the argument by denying that the climate is cooling/warming/changing because of human activity.  Others approach the argument by showing that the climate has and always will be in a state of change no matter what humans do.

Like the tobacco industry back in its day, they don't try to convince you that the basic science is wrong or fake, but they tell you, ""oh, but, there is evidence of high temps with low carbon"", ""There are many factors"" etc etc. Just like it used to be: ""oh, but one study found no correlation between cancer and smoking"", ""oh, but think at all the other cancer-related factors"".

They pull you away from what the scientific community at large is saying by flooding you with facts that don't have much to do with the existence or not of global warming, but are spread in such a way to suggest that scientists don't actually know what's going on; it's designed to confuse you. As a practical example, the absence of a strong relationship between CO2 and temperature in certain geological periods does not mean that CO2 doesn't raise temperatures, it just means that _in addition_ to CO2, the temperature has also risen due to other factors in the past that at certain times were more powerful than CO2. In no way that disproves the effect of CO2.

Or for a more real-life example. I'm cooking fried chicken for you every evening, sometimes I put garlic on it, sometimes I don't. When I add garlic, the chicken tastes awful, when I don't, it's good. You tell me to stop adding garlic, but then one day I cook the chicken for like 1 minute, without garlic, and it's raw inside and of course it tastes awful as a result. I serve it to you, you tell me it sucks, and I say ""see, garlic has nothing to do with how good the chicken tastes, because the chicken tasted bad this time even though there was no garlic!"". Is that a reasonable statement to make?

To demonstrate corporate trickery, let me ask the question: what scientific institution, research body, scientist union, or scientific panel etc stated that ""the amount of carbon we will put into the atmosphere will not detrimentally affect the human species""?

It's more or less the same tactic that was used by the tobacco industry when they were trying to hide the evidence that smoking causes cancer from the public eye. The overall aim is never to openly say that it's all fake, because that would be too blatant and it would make it obvious that there's a covert interest.

Instead, they (where they = tobacco corp yesterday; big oil crop today) use a strategy of chaos, basically they try to make it look like all the scientists are in disagreement and no one actually knows whether climate change is real or has any real impact. That's why you hear less actual arguments against the existence of climate change and a lot more generic arguments like ""but global cooling"", ""but but one scientist once misspelled 'climate'"", ""but this one climate model"".

You'll never republican politicians or big corp outright claim that CO2 doesn't convert IR radiation into heat, because that would be a blatant and ridiculous denial of basic chemistry (even though it would be the only way to falsify the science behind climate change since it's based on that). But you'll hear them making lots of other arguments designed to throw doubt on science in general. For example, ""but most scientists don't explicitly say that at least 50% of climate change is caused by humans"" doesn't refute climate change in any way, but it makes it sound like scientists are clueless.

That IS the difference. In other words: a good environment gives you more chances of dying peacefully because the degradation is equalized and slow (which gives your consciousness the time to adapt to those tiny changes). On the other hand, you feel like one day, Darth Vador suddenly enters your life. Think of your last days on earth.

""That is democratic politics today. A large reason why Clinton lost is due to her basically being the physical embodiment of identity politics. Democrats have a huge push for the idea of 'you're black so you're oppressed so vote for us because we'll fix it. If not you're making a mistake'. This is a toxic mentality.""

I have to agree with you, Clinton was a flawed candidate and giving more privileges to minority groups than the majority is a flawed mentality. Then again, one could argue that this election was full of bad apples and that many voted under the philosophy of the lesser of two evils.

""This is interesting because one, you would inherently support the Trump travel ban and the wall due to your argument against this topic, which are the things most democrats HATE about trump.""

I have no idea where you derived that idea from, as I am strongly against both. For the wall, most illegal immigration from Mexico comes from the aviation industry, so building a wall is an extremely inefficient usage of resources. As for the travel ban, the vast, vast majority of terrorist attacks on US soil (with the exception of 9/11) are caused by people born and raised in the United States. The amount of attacks that it would prevent are minuscule. 

""Secondly, again, most will agree that there is a problem with poverty, but the solutions is where it gets dicy, and of course there are many people that are lazy, not to say there are many that aren't.""

While I agree that the solution to ending poverty is far from agreed on, I once again have to disagree with your claim that many are lazy. While it is true that a small percentage of the homeless enjoys their life as it is, rarely, if ever, are they lazy. Bad with handling finances? Probably. But more often than not it's either a result of being poorly raised or a lack of available jobs that leads to and keeps people in poverty, often both.

""Going back to number 2, a large part of democratic politics today is attempting to empower and protect the minority (LGBTQ,  African Americans, Muslims, etc) from the majority. What the founders wanted was that one person (I.e. King) shouldn't have excessive power, and the government as a whole shouldn't have excessive power. Ever since FDR, a democrat, the presidency has ever grown in power, which prompts greater power of the other branches to balance. Republicans are strictly against this: the increasing power of the government outside of its basic responsibility to keep its citizens physically safe and keep the peace within the country. This is seen in economic policy especially with the idea of free market and less regulations on businesses so businesses can compete, grow, and be created without strong government favoritism and with stronger consumer favoritism.""

I know that this sounds weird coming from a liberal democrat, but I have to agree with you on these points. The only thing that I am slightly against is the subject of economy regulation, and that is because I believe that you need some regulation to keep the economy stable and ensure the safety of the workers, consumers, and environment.

I feel that it should be stated that in many aspects I'm much more down the middle than the stereotypical liberal, but that's the problem with a two party system, stereotypical Democrats and Republicans are not average Democrats and Republicans. Regardless on how extreme or mild of a democrat or republican you are, you are still categorized as a member of that party.

You can't make concrete without CO² nor can you sustain 7.5 billion people with out petroleum based chemical fertilizers.  The Paris climate agreement is wrong.

Hell just in energy parasites (as an example) that we all have around our house in the form of thise little tiny LED lights and useless clocks on all modern electronic devices, the USA could shut down 2 coal power plants just by out pawing them from being installed for stupid reasons (like why is there a tiny red light on wen my TV is off, I am aware it is off because there is no picture).  Or how about the power strips that flash a light saying they are working...
My point is there is realistic ways to lower energy consumption and it shouldn't cost the American money to do so, if anything it should save money because you are using less energy...

Your argument about private enterprise is a strawman.

The govt. has funded plnety of innovate, beneficial projects in the past.  Ultimately, it really doesn't matter who funds, develops, or implements clean energy projects, just so long as it GETS DONE.

""countless studies"" and ""even if you have to make it up"": Essentially all studies whose conclusions are brought about by modeling, which primarily use synthetic data because there isn't enough actual data to construct models, are fraudulent, especially as this synthetic data is often manipulated to provide evidence for the hypothesis and not the other way around. The IPCC is the primary perpetrator of such data manipulation, and they provide modeling data for numerous other researchers, hence the statement ""countless studies.""

""which is meant to appeal to liberal-arts-degree imbeciles"": This is not an ad hominem, as I am not stating that because liberal-arts-degree imbeciles believe it, it must be false. I am simply saying that false claims like the ""97% of scientists"" one are meant to appeal to individuals who wish to associate with something that makes them appear more intellectual. Thus, if you can politicize and polarize the topic and make it appear that one side is ""in the know"" and the other side are baboons, then people who have something to prove are likely to jump on board. I could say the same thing about atheism; it tends to be a topic associated with rationality and intellectualism, and so it is prominent with a certain kind of youth who needs a little more to distinguish themselves than just their purple hair.

""Independently-minded people and people who know propaganda when they see it"": The fact that I need to mention that there is a case to be made for non-anthropogenic climate change, or that a good number of climate scientists do not agree that humans are having a profound impact on the climate, goes to show how far-reaching this propaganda is. As I mentioned before, when did anthropogenic climate change become a scientific fact? It never did, but you wouldn't know it by the way the issue has been politicized.

""Funny how... perpetuates their bias"": As I mentioned, the ""97% of scientists"" figure is an outright lie, in both cases of the use of the ""97%"" figure -- the survey one and the scientific papers one. And so the fact that this figure is still used today goes to show that the Left wants to perpetuate their own bias, regardless of veracity. I also wanted to point out how a good portion of the Left considers themselves ""freethinkers,"" which makes this whole thing a bit ironic, no?
Source: https://wattsupwiththat.com/2014/07/11/the-climate-consensus-is-not-97-its-100/

""Naturally increasing temperatures"": I don't have to provide a citation for this, though there are dozens mentioning that man's impact on the climate is minimal. It is the Left who wants to impose drastic measures by claiming that something is substantially out of the norm. Let them provide the citations then - and real ones at that.

Middle paragraph is pretty much a conspiracy: I believe that you must not have seen my second post, in which I state, ""And when you factor in the fact that, with this global initiative, governments stand to gain power in the form of a further excuse for regulatory expansion and increased tax revenue, pardon me if I'm a bit skeptical and think there's a conflict of interest for governments to fund studies of this sort."" We are talking about hundreds of billions of dollars here in the US alone.

The graph at the end he showed:

1) does not account for fugitive methane (that's the actual term for methane lost to environment due to leaks), which in itself is a powerful GHG.
2) The graph doesn't account for the EROEI of coal as compared to shale oil. In reality, coal is twice as efficient as shale oil when it comes to the final energy output. (Although I do have to reserve my stand on this as shale oil is a relatively new technology compared to coal extraction. Perhaps with time, shale oil can be more efficient. Still, it won't be more efficient than coal by a whole lot.)
3) The environmental damage is far more extreme when it comes to shale oil. For coal production, you just excavate that stuff. Shale oil requires liquid processing and often release the sulphide compounds (usually found in oil resevoir) into the soil. Not to mention other pollutants that is in the fracking liquid.

I'm not advocating the use of coal over shale oil. What I'm saying is that the view presented by him is erroneous and designed to lead people into thinking that shale oil is the better of the two when that is clearly not true. Both fuel source are equally bad when it comes to the environment. Solar power and wind farms are bad to the environment too, incinerating birds and whatnot,  just not the 'cause irreversible snowballing effect of global warming' kind of bad.

I think you should take note of the phrasing used in your third source ""reduce global temperature rise about 0.17°C in 2100."" and then the Pairs agreement's aim of ""a long-term goal of keeping the increase in global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels"" (my first source). That is the exact same thing. Reducing it to a certain limit and making sure that it doesn't exceed a limit, (I didn't spot it before, partly because the video was using Fahrenheit and mainly because the video's graph on temperature increase only appears very briefly - 2:23).I won't argue whether or not the Paris agreement will succeed in achieving this goal.

The green climate fund is used as a way for developed countries to give to developing countries. ""The Fund aims to mobilize funding at scale to invest in low-emission and climate-resilient development on our home planet."" http://www.greenclimate.fund/about-gcf/global-context#mission 

The nationally determined contributions are the cost of achieving the temperature reduction goals per country, i.e investing more into renewable technologies. I didn't forget it, as it was not order from the Paris agreement - as each country sets its own methods for achieving its own goals - and this adds to the GDP of countries by providing jobs and importing less fossil fuels. 

As for the cost of implementation - the national determined contributions -  which your source stated as $2.5 trillion for the US (which for some reason thinks manufacturing will be directly and adversely effected). Except this doesn't include the benefits of such implementation. Such as increasing jobs in construction, research and engineering or the added investment into renewable technologies by the government or the lowered imports on fossil fuels. Every economy will need to switch to renewable energy sources to both save the planet and as an alternative to finite fossil fuels. 

""They're using the UN's models."" Are they? The video uses a few graphs the first being the US emissions with and without the clean power plan - that's the obvious reason why I chose to find the real emissions' predictions for the US - and should at least show some sort of gradual decrease in emissions all along the timeline as the US economy switches over to renewable energy sources. The temperature increase graph straight afterwards suggests that with the agreement the temperature rise at the end of the century would be a little under 8*F (4.4*C) but again this does not show the actual aim of 3.6*F (2*C) by the end of the century. The third graph tries to predict the global emissions but for some reason has the second line (with the Paris agreement) flatline as soon as its implemented then continue on the same trend despite more investment into renewables worldwide. The last graph that i want to bring up is the Climate action tracker which is just flatly wrong. The Paris agreement pledges are to limit the temperature increase to 2*C and to aim to reach 1.5*C as I have already given sources and is unarguable what their aims are.

If PragerU had any real sources they could use then they would reference them properly.

I know that the agreement was aiming to reduce temperatures, that's kind of the point. We'll just agree to reduce temperatures & it'll happen because we will it so. This in itself should convince any sane person just how asinine this is. So lets put aside the pseudoscience behind AGW alarmism & take them at their word. Looking at the EPA climate model & ignoring how they exaggerate the effectiveness of international emissions reductions - by their own numbers if they hit all their targets by 2030 & maintain it until 2100 the total reduction would be 0.17 degrees C (0.3 degrees F).

The US contribution to that reduction (again, using their own numbers) would be about 0.015 degrees.

If these Democrats had their way, some 40,000 factories would close and more Americans would be on public assistance; yet they would feel better that they tried to use government power to stop the use of fossil fuels that heat our homes and fuel our cars, and put Americans in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Ohio out on the streets.

The value of the Paris Agreement is two fold: 1) make sure that the world bucks the emissions trend and decouple growth from emissions as soon as possible with short term solutions, thus buying time to make the bigger advancements with technology that is currently being developed; 2) Setting the direction that the entire world is moving towards, thus creating the stable political objective that is needed to unleash the major investments.

The Paris agreement is a framework that sets the goal (limit warming to 1.5*C if possible, 2*C at most), and has a review system that enables new pledges to be increased if possible and needed. The reality is that it is a compromise that brought on board (almost) all of the nations of the world in this process, while leaving national sovereignty intact.

Lomborg also misrepresents the 'cost' issue, since most of that will be investments. They replace investments in fossil fuels, so one has to look at the additional investments that are needed. Luckily, we are already seeing renewable energy reaching price levels that outcompete fossil fuels, e.g. vs. natural gas in the Middle East, vs. Coal in India, Offshore windpower in the NOrth Sea, wind & solar in large parts of the USA. And prices of solar, wind, storage etc will continue to decline with economies of scale and technological advancements.

He also fails to mention the cost of doing nothing, which is the damage that is being created by both local emissions effects (a.o. sooth air pollution) and climate change effects. The International Energy Agency estimates this to be in the order of US$ 5 trillion per year, to be 'paid' in sufference by future generations.

There is however one main thing which i always miss in Climate discussions (and the disturbing effect that for Scientists Climate change == Funding).

The difficulty of actions against climate change lie in the interpretation of model:

Numerical model simulations rely on a large number of empirical statements and assumptions which are prone to produce an error. Models CAN NOT predict reality to the n-th decimal point.

Numerical models do however capture the effect of the (main) processes involved and confirm that emission reduction is an urgent necessity.

When politicians define goals it has to be defined in solid numbers and not as the ""grey zone"" of which the actually state of knowledge consists. Scientists do the discussions, politicians make decisions (at least if you have good ones).

The truth is, and will always be a range and not a yes/no statement. So let us please stop nitpicking over tiny details and keep a workable situation.

I'm also glad that he mentioned the solution is green energy research and development. It's clear that it is too late for Trump's coal jobs to come back. Natural gas is far cheaper than coal, most coal jobs have moved to the western parts of the United States instead of Pennsylvania because their machinery is able to do the work of several men i.e. automation taking jobs, and the solar energy industry posted huge growth last year over the fossil fuel industry. However I'm shocked to hear that he thinks that natural gas, and the fracking used to obtain it, is under the umbrella of green energy R&D. It is clearly not. The point of green energy is zero carbon emissions, not ""lower CO2 gas,"" which isn't saying much considering how CO2 heavy coal is. How could you even pretend that's part of green energy innovation? Finally, yes private investors will be those who bring us to fully renewable green energy in the United States now that Trump is gutting the EPA science research division and government subsidies for green energy research. Private investment into solar and wind and electric cars pushed for by Elon Musk and Bill Gates is already too large for the subsidy cuts to matter anymore.

Just in case anyone here seriously thinks that:
No. There is an insane difference between dumping water used in a reactor and dumping nuclear waste. There is an insane difference between rivers and the sea. 
""Radioactive waste"" is a really broad term. HLW (which is what is really dangerous to environment and humans) is and has NEVER been dumped. There are accounts of ILW and LLW being dumped by Italian mafia, but those could never be proven. I could go into detail here, but I would really encourage you to do some research yourself.
The reason why Japanese workers dumped radioactive water into the sea is simple: It is diluted to an insane degree. And I mean insane to a point where it is barely measurable and ABSOLUTELY safe for humans. While there might possibly be slight disturbances to local fauna and flora, nature is generally really good at dealing with radioactivity (see Chernobyl). A guy once challenged me ""well if it's so safe, why don't you only use and consume water from the sea around Fukushima, without the salt of course"", and you might be surprised to learn that if I did that, I would have nothing to fear whatsoever. I would completely counteract the expected increase and even decrease my radiation dosage by moving to Japan. But even if I stayed here (we have a comparably high amount of background radiation where I live) I would be perfectly safe. If you are scared of radioactivity at those dosages: Never ever board a plane.",5.0,1.0,,47bNzLj5E_Q,

The production of solar panels is extremely harmful to the environment and they have to be replaced surprisingly often. Not to mention that we have no clue how to actually use solar energy: Energy consuption is lower if the sun shines.
Wind turbines are a better option, but they're also very inefficient and we also have no idea how to use the produced energy.
On the other hand nuclear energy is extremely efficient. I really like the ""(Produced energy - Effort) / Risk (inc. Environmental)"" formula, because it shows how nuclear is far superior to solar. 
I'm not saying that nuclear energy is perfect. But most of nuclear tech is from the 1980s or older. If we utilize modern technology with safer, more efficient reactors that produce a lot less waste and can even produce energy with our current nuclear waste, we can actually make a change. But we can't because people have no clue how nuclear energy works and just think that ""nukular is evil"".

To adress the most common points: Fukushima was a desaster that happened because outdated tech was hit by a literal tsunami. Yet, the aftermath has been pretty tame. 
Chernobyl was caused by engineers playing around with new tech, it was a human error coupled with now completely outdated safety precautions.
Hiroshima and Nagasaki have nothing to do with nuclear energy. You can not compare Nukes to Nuclear energy, that would be like comparing a car engine to a giant petrol bomb.",10.0,1.0,,47bNzLj5E_Q,

That is what caused the past warmings. And CO2 was involved because as soon as the temperature rose from the sun the earth's atmosphere could hold more CO2 which increased temperatures exponentially.
This is not the case now. The average global temperature has only risen after the industrial age. Before humans started to release CO2 in the air the earth was pretty balanced with the oceans and land absorbing the CO2 they released. Although we humans release tiny amounts of CO2 over the years they added up because there wasn't anything to absorb it.

Like I mentioned in my previous comment, I don't rely on guesses. And since many reports of the EPA have turned out to be speculations that were blown out of proportion, I've lost trust in the EPA. Besides, putting (blind) faith in government institutions is synonymous with primitively absolving oneself from critical thinking, due to unfounded fear of being branded a miscreant/heretic. I also mentioned that lithium (mining) is much more dangerous than fracking. And since shale gas is a form of energy that is much cheaper than solar and wind, it would be much more affordable for (economically) poor people. So, if people like you continue attempting to suppress fracking, you will continue to keep poor people in poverty and squalor. That says more about you than me.

Your childish cringing about fracking and climate change reminds me of Spencer's law. In plain English, Spencer's law means that when a social problem is genuinely widespread and severe, it will attract little notice or discussion. It will only become the object of attention, concern, and controversy precisely, when it is in decline and its severity is diminishing. So the less of a problem there is, the more that is written about it!

Anyway, the fluid used for Hydraulic Fracturing consist of the following:
- 99.51 per cent water and sand
- the remaining 0.49 per cent consist of laughable 13 chemicals that are used in every average household and every garage.

These 13 harmless chemicals are citric acid (lemon juice), hydrogen chloride (can be found in swimming pools), glutaraldehyde (disinfectants and antiseptics), guar gum (an ingredient found in ice cream), dimethylformamide (plastic), isopropyl (an alcohol found in deodorant), boric acid (washing soap contains that ingredient), ammonium persulphate (an ingredient that is used to dye one's hair), potassium chloride (intravenous drips/infusions), sodium carbonate (an ingredient found in dishwasher detergent, food additive), ethylene glycol (defroster), ammonium bisulphite (an ingredient found in cosmetics) and finally petroleum distillate (another ingredient that is found in cosmetics).

So, as you can see, fracking is not as dangerous as many gullible and hypocritical people claim.

In short: Paris is not too helpful and your solution adds  even less. It goes from bad to worse. 

the solution? Taxing. People should look up the effect on emissions in Australia (and what happened when the rightwing gouvernment stopped it in 2014 when they took over).
People should look up British Columbia, that Canadian province which taxed whereas the other did not. Its emissions fell but thanks to the others Canada's totall emission rose significantly.

So tax it. Make those who pollute our atmosphere with these gasses pay for the costs to clean it. And also make them pay for the indirec tcosts like sealevelrise and the money it costs to protect, say, Miami (look up how much taxpayers need to pay for that).
Seems fair enough. So yes: it may be expensive, but guess what: if you emit..you pay.

 • a long-term goal of keeping the increase in global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels;
 • to aim to limit the increase to 1.5°C, since this would significantly reduce risks and the impacts of climate change;

It does no say anything about limiting CO2 emission.
But practically every country has assumed this to be a reduction in CO2 emission.  If this is a fact, why doesn't the Paris Agreement just come out and say ""reduce CO2 emission by  (this much)"".  

Instead, it issues a non-statement like ""keeping the increase in global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels"".

Because nobody knows what ""pre-industrial"" temperature level is, everybody jumps into the CO2-emission-caused temperature rise myth.

What evidence do they have that CO2 emission is the cause of global warming?



They quote just these two ""devices"":

1.  The co-relation between CO2 rise and   temperature rise, which they mis-interpreted.  The temperature rise has caused the CO2 Increase, not the other way around

I'm a geologist working in western Canada, and I took many courses throughout my Bachelors on atmospheric modelling, climate analysis, and how humans contribute to the atmosphere. Seeing people equate weather to climate, make references to ""global cooling"", or espouse denial in other areas of the subject shows their general ignorance.

Even Trump and the majority of the GOP have quietly shifted from ""100% it does not exist"" to ""okay maybe it does exist but we shouldn't do anything about it"". I give them ten years tops before they shift to "" Okay we should start doing something about it"". Conservatives deny climate change for several reasons; first, it represents a market externality - that is, the market caused tangible harm in an area they had no forseen. This requires regulation to fix, which of course the conservatives hate. Second, the general hostility to science from SOME of the right contributes to a mistrust in scientists, and therefore an unwillingness to discuss and study their ideas (those damn evolutionists!)

Good news for you conservatives though, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT SOLUTION! Already solar energy is projected to become cheaper than coal extremely soon, and India and China are building solar power plants at an enormous rate. Just as oil supplanted coal as the dominant energy force of the 20th century, renewables will do the same to fossil fuels in the 21st century. Market forces are indeed the solution.

This is why I never describe myself as left or right wing, but look at the evidence before arriving at a conclusion. Conservatives plug their fingers in their ears and close their eyes and pretend climate change doesn't exist - liberals see it as an opportunity to advance their political agenda.

Oh and you want to point out that they're ""making it safer every year""??
I should hope so because Fracking has been an environmental nightmare for the places where it is already being used.   There are people in fracking areas where the water supply is so contaminated that they can actually light their tapwater on FIRE as it comes out of the tap.  And you want to call it Safe?
Every hour, natural gas facilities in North Texas' Barnett Shale region emit thousands of tons of methane—a greenhouse gas at least 20 times more potent than carbon dioxide—and a slate of noxious pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and benzene. 

All Current and Planned Fracking should be halted immediately.   Natural Gas may be lower emission, but it is still a fossil fuel.    Natural Gas already reached peak production years ago.   Fracking is simply a last ditch effort to get at the Natural Gas ""by any means necessary"".

Thorium Nuclear power generation is the ""Large Scale"" answer we need.

His quoted solution is that private investment will magically cure the problem- which it won't. Private investment will only incur if the investors can hope to see a profit. The fact is most technologies are economically uncompetitive when compared against to fossil fuels. The success of PV cells today was only achieved because governments gave financial subsidies to private investment over the course of many decades and only now are we beginning to see PV cells as an economical solution. What the Paris Climate agreement does is guarantee subsidies for a whole range of technologies which still need a lot of time to mature. This is critical because no private investor would ever see a profit from them. In order to truly decarbonise the economy it will need a myriad of technologies working together. So of course the actual savings will be low at first because most technologies are still really immature. Cutting government investment now will certainly kill of any hope we have to solve global warming.,0.0,0.0,,47bNzLj5E_Q,

Lol, cuts agreed must only be short term by definition.  the parallel climb of the two graphs as shown is completely inappropriate. It assumes that if we meet the cuts, we won't meet again on the topic ever again. This is patently false, and nobody should expect governments to make firm agreements on 100 year targets, given there's too many unknowns.

Luckily we are probably nearing the point where new investment in renewables will have a higher NPV then most fossil fuel sources. The purpose of govt intervention is to influence capitalistic behaviour in a way that favours the long term. Fracking and recent developments in fossil fuel innovation have their own by products and other issues, and it might be that the middle step to nuclear or a clean fossil fuel like natural gas is no longer needed.

The reason global agreements are necessary is because it is a global problem. It's rationally unjust for specific companies to target greener targets, only for other countries (particularly developing countries like China and India) where the economic boom is coupled with some of the worst pollution increases.

Most notably that climate change is not only being driven by greenhouse gases. I'll explain a little climatology to you. The predictions of a reduction in temperature by 1.6 degrees are not ""based on assumptions"" but rather basic physics. In climate science, there's something called positive and negative feedback. Some examples of this include the ice caps; ice is one of the most reflective natural surfaces on the planet. The hotter the climate gets, the more the ice will melt (as we're seeing) and the less ice there will be to reflect sun energy back to space. This will mean that more water is exposed, which is one of the darkest natural surfaces on Earth, the more water that is exposed, the more sunlight it will absorb. The more sunlight the water absorbs will further heat the water which will melt more ice, expose more water, and so on. However this also works in reverse, i.e. negative feedback. The more we reduce carbon emissions, the more we will promote negative feedback such as the ice caps, and there are dozens more examples that all start with us reducing CO2 emissions.",1.0,0.0,,47bNzLj5E_Q,

The point is that even if a phenomenon is natural it doesn't mean it wouldn't be a problem

""You also haven't explained how an increase in CO2 would be catastrophic. ""

Well, our food supply is based around the climate we have now, more severe and common droughts or floods depending on the areas on it's own can be catastrophic, even if you try to move farm land to other places where it may not be as bad it'll continue to happen if nothing is done, some might insist that we should just try to grow food in canada if it defrosts, it doesn't change the fact that it gets much less direct sunlight which on it's own makes it difficult to grow food even if it were warmer, remember plants aren't magic. Sea level rise is bad for port towns for both trade and the fact that most populations tend to be around water, not to mention ports for trade as they stand aren't really suited for very much sea level rise so you'll likely have to replace or rebuild those entirely. Cities that are susceptible to sea level rise will either have to spend exponentially more on flood control or be abandoned since doing nothing would simply accelerate the process over time. You'll abandon the infrastructure and the trade associated with it to rebuild elsewhere, you'll also have to put those displaced people somewhere.

It will probably take over a hundred years before it becomes ""catastrophic"", in either case it will be very expensive and costs would only accelerate as you have to address more and more collective damage, and well even if we stopped on a dime later it takes a long time for temperatures to reach equilibrium. Just from what we've already released we know  with reasonable certainty it'll be bad, the only question is how bad will we let it get in the long term. Keep in mind I'm only generally listing the direct human effects, having ecologies collapse where we still depend on much of it for food sources is also a pretty bad thing in it's self.

""You do realize that we have tropical plants under ice in northern Canada precisely because the world was substantially warmer at one point than it is now.""

There was a time where there was 2 miles of ice at the equator and a time when sea levels were 200 meters higher, if your argument is ""because it happened in the past it would be fine now"" I'll respectfully disagree.

""You're simply not powerful enough to stop them and too proud to realize how impotent you or any other person is to do so.""

We have direct measurements of this long term trend. As we burned fossil fuels we took old sequestered carbon that took the earth millenia to sequester, burned it for energy which increases the CO2 in the atmosphere.

While it's true plants inhale more CO2 and produce O2 as a result, it's not enough to offset what we do yearly. Most of our emissions are sequestered in the oceans, some into plants. The small amount of excess each year simply builds up in the atmosphere since plants aren't magic and still require other resources to grow.

2) Well yeah we are, you're asserting any climate change cannot be caused by man because climate change of any kind has happened before man. Replace climate change with fire and you get the same absurd argument.

3) This doesn't disprove my statement, you don't have to be a direct witness to determine there was a fire.

""if we are responsible for an increase in CO2, more plants will grow and change it back to O2.""

Again while technically true it's not enough to offset the emissions we give off. Again we're burning carbon deposits that took the earth millennia to sequester, insisting that plants will magically keep it in balance is well interesting, to say the least.

Not to mention this ignores other factors at play like positive feedbacks, like ice reflects more light than dark blue oceans, methane emissions from bacteria buried in perma frost becoming more active as they warm, methane hydrates which destabalize and make more methane emissions as they warm, etc etc.

Also the fact that historical reconstructions indicate that plants can't keep up with even natural CO2 increases which were much slower in nature would tend to betray your assertion that you think it will fix it on it's own. CO2 levels only dropped as cooling came about from other forcing which allowed the oceans to sequester more CO2.

""If we are not responsible for atmospheric changes, then it's not a problem anyway because it's natural.""

If, and it doesn't necessarily mean that something would not be a problem just because it's natural either. If an asteroid were headed for earth you probably wouldn't assert that because it's natural there is no problem.

If there is an increase in CO2, there would be an increase in O2, since plants ""inhale our exhales"".  However, earth is atmospherically a closed system, so the CO2 and O2 are in a constant state of flux... like waves on a beach ebb and flow; they never climb mountains 2000 miles inland.  (Job 38:11)  You don't seem to science much.  

2. No, we're not talking about ""similar phenomenon"".  We're talking about the same phenomenon.  Stop trying to wiggle out of your previous assertion by graying it up.  You're comparing apples to elephants and hoping no one will notice.

3. Forensic evidence can indicate there is a burn of some sort, but you do realize you can have combustion of various kinds.  You assume that there was a fire on what evidence?  Natural fires lose evidence quite quickly; nature reclaims the residue.  Any fire (not talking about molten rock / lava) that we can see forensic evidence of would have to be extremely recent, like within a life time recent.  Even lava goes solid again in hours.  We can see ancient evidence of massive flooding, but not of fires.

So once again, if we are responsible for an increase in CO2, more plants will grow and change it back to O2.  Crisis averted.  If we are not responsible for atmospheric changes, then it's not a problem anyway because it's natural.  Once again.  What's your point?",0.0,1.0,,47bNzLj5E_Q,

2) However, your assertion is any given type of phenomenon cannot be caused by man only because similar phenomenon happened before man. I'm stating that using the same logic, therefore no fires can be caused by man so therefore arson is not a problem using your logic.

Reuctio ad absurdum

3) Why would you need a witness to determine a fire was caused? One can determine a fire was set off without witnessing the fire being set. In the same way one can determine a crime was committed without any witnesses to verify it, I can also determine if someone was there with fingerprint or dna evidence

As methane rises into the air, it reacts with the hydroxyl radical to create water vapor and carbon dioxide. The lifespan of methane in the atmosphere was estimated at 9.6 years as of 2001; however, increasing emissions of methane over time reduce the concentration of the hydroxyl radical in the atmosphere.

They already produce more solar panels than the US does per year.  Innovation only happens through government subsidy, market pressure is never enough especially when you have equal forces pushing back against said market force.

The problem was that it was not bigger which is why we have had such sluggish growth until two years ago when things finally got traction.  As for projections, what projections?  All projections have been for 2035 to 2050 and beyond aside from sea levels rising (check out the California coast line, its receding) and systemic failure of glaciers in the Arctic.  These two things are patently proven, the rest won't be observable until at least 2050.  That stuff in the 70's about cooling has been discredited for 25 years at least.  As for Al Gore, sometimes you have to exaggerate to get people to listen; hell Trump does it all of the time.

Aside from that, the Green energy boom going on right now is going to create the largest industry we have ever seen and it will destroy oil, coal, fracking.  It already has done in coal in the US, nothing will bring it back.  The other will be gone by 2025.  The only question is do you want to lose those jobs forever, or, like Clinton was saying, change them into the Green Energy jobs of the future.  Right now China is going to get nearly all of the economic benefits of being the green energy superpower of tomorrow because we have short sighted individuals in this country that refuse to think that far ahead.  The amount of money they will make from it will make 100 billion look like a penny in comparison.

lol you should open a history book instead of quoting right wing apologists who are afraid of guilt by association.
Socialized medicine in Germany is from the 1880s and was 50 years old when Hitler took over.
Hitler was voted into power with the support if the conservative and Christian parties with only the communists and social democrats opposing him.
Hitler imprisoned and killed socialists and communists.
The doctors who killed ppl were nazi's not socialists.
And before you come with the ""but their name"" argument, hitler himself said that ""true (national) socialism"" has nothing to do with Marxist socialism and wasn't anti private ownership. It is a right wing and not a left wing ideology. Which is also obvious in Germany of today where ""rechts"" (right wing) is a synonym for nazi.

Not to say that what he states is wrong, it is clearly supported by apt research and correctly interpreted data, but you really need to read up on more sources to see the full picture. Climate change remains a largely scientific problem, and governments still remain as the bearers of the biggest resources to conduct research and development on green energy, carbon capture, and transportation reform. These innovations will not prevail without subsidies, as the private sector is just not big enough to tackle everything head-on. Mr Lomborg may tell you the costs and financial challenges facing us down the road, but this does not mean that we should be doing less. In fact, he is right to point out that the Paris agreement does not achieve much, we should do much more than that to slow down global warming.

I have not heard about this supposed saturation point, it sounds interesting, but I'm skeptical. The main concern is the ""runaway greenhouse effect"" where the temperature increases exponentially (higher temperatures lead to more release of CO2 which leads to higher temperatures). An example of the runaway greenhouse effect is Venus, which despite being further away from the Sun than Mercury, still maintains a higher temperature. Life certainly did flourish under higher CO2 concentrations. The living organism currently alive are not those living beings though. Life can adapt and will most likely survive either way, but the rapid changes in climate will lead to extinctions. Life can only evolve so fast. That plants produce higher crop yields is something that is disputed. Higher CO2 concentrations is predicted to cause hotter and drier climate. Those negative effects, in conjunction with nitrogen being a limiting factor negate the benefits in most cases. 2015 data from NOAA and several papers dispute this ""pause"" heavily.

Sustainables are typically governed by manufacturing economics (manufacturing solar panels, batteries, etc), while fossil fuels are governed by natural resource/mining economics. 

This means that renewables and fossil fuels have very different learning curves. Manufactured products get cheaper per unit the more you make (and this is particularly the case for the semiconductors industry to which solar panels belong) , while natural resources get more and more expensive per unit the more of them you make, since the easiest deposits to reach are mined first so that the remaining ones get progressively more difficult to mine. As such, the price curves will inevitably cross and renewables will be cheaper in the long run.

A key component of climate treaties such as the UNFCCC is the subsidizing of renewable power sources as a replacement for fossil fuels. These subsidies have the effect of pushing the industries farther down their learning curves so that their prices fall long-term, and this should be included as an economic benefit when the final cost of a treaty is considered. 

We have already passed the point where solar power is significantly cheaper during the day than fossil fuels in most of the world. Solar power is becoming a net economic gain to power-hungry industries such as Aluminum production where the cost of the end product is dominated by the electricity cost and which don't need to be run around the clock. As the cost of power storage solutions also drops, we can expect to see the same gains on a larger scale for baseline power.

And this is the key component. Subsidizing new technologies is not a net economic loss, because in the long run you gain a new set of technologies which give you non-negligible economic benefits.",0.0,0.0,,47bNzLj5E_Q,

We don't know the extent of man-made climate change or even if it will be bad.  Man-made global warming could solve world hunger by making previously non-arable land more hospitable for farming, for all we know.  Plants love CO2 and life on Earth is far more abundant and thrives better in hot, humid climates than in cooler climates.  But that idea is just as unproven and sounds just as ridiculous as the notion that climate change will turn into a massive hurricane that will drown us all in the next few years.  It is far more likely that the Earth is an extremely complex arrangement of ecosystems that is entirely capable of regulating itself and adapting to dramatic changes.

My best guess is that there will be negative and positive consequences, and they will happen a lot more slowly than these alarmists are ""predicting.""  Some areas will get weather patterns that aren't great, others will get better more temperate weather.  Some species may die, others will be born.  We don't need to waste trillions of dollars and plunge the first world back into the cart-and-horse era to survive some impending apocalypse.

And no, ""97% of scientists"" don't agree on... whatever you think they agree on.  Even if they did, that isn't how science works.  Science is based on skepticism and criticism, not consensus.  Consensus didn't prove the Earth was flat and it didn't prove the Sun revolved around us.  Skepticism did.  Whenever you hear the word ""consensus"" alarm bells should be going off.  

There is more to this story.  I think history shows that panicking over some man-made apocalypse doesn't get us anywhere, and the apocalypse isn't coming nearly as fast as ""consensus"" agreed it was.

Meanwhile, other theories which explain why we have seen a global pause in temperature rise go ignored by the MSM and political powers that stand to gain from drastic measures to reduce temperatures.   Scientists that are studying solar cycles are putting forth some very convincing predictions that match up well with the history of our planet - predictions that say we are currently entering a cooling period pushed by forces much more significant than anything humans are doing.

I personally am much more convinced we are headed for significant drops in global temperatures in the near future, but I am not a climate scientist and therefore I can only listen to the various arguments and theories and make the best conclusion as I can.    My point is, to do this we all need to keep an open mind and vet our sources as best we can.  To follow political leaders blindly is foolish considering how often they lie and manipulate.

I think that there are multiple reasons as to why climate change has become so infected with opinions that are normally seen in completely different societal subjects, and I think that its the fault of both sides, if you can call it two sides. 

There should ofcourse be debate, and there should also be criticism. But dont treat it like one of the more ideological och political subjects in todays infected debates, because its not.

I'll take a look at a few things here. First: The critique of the Paris agreement, Second: The supposed solutions found in private investments, Third: Fracking and gas.
Sources will be listed in the bottom.

*The Paris Agreement:* Sure, you can direct critique at the Paris climate agreement. It's nowhere _near_ radical enough (the 2° mark is long gone according to the UN scientists, folks. 4° is the much more likely global increase at this point.), but honestly, if it was anymore radical it wouldn't be signed by anyone and it'd be just like the Copenhagen agreement which no one wanted to sign and thus, no result came out of the week long negotiations during (and prior) to the conference.
And now, regarding the way the critique was handed out... Was the critique done in an inflammatory manner? Yes. 
Did they ignore the fact that the deal is considered a ""historical turning point"" because they actually got nations to sign it? Yes. 
And did they build a climate activist strawman who thinks the deal is the greatest thing that ever happened in the world? Yes, yes they did.

*Solutions in Private Investment?:* Indeed, philanthropic billionaires like Bill Gates and Richard Branson have both invested billions in climate related research and development. I am glad fracking wasn't directly (even though it was heavy suggested) mentioned here as a ""green"", climate positive investment as I will elaborate on later. 
Bill Gates have invested in billions (Branson just talked about billions and didn't invest very much) in companies like Terra Power (a company researching nuclear power) and especially the fancy sounding company ""Intellectual Ventures"". Ventures Have been heavily accused of engaging in what's popularly called ""patent trolling"". Rest assured though. Intellectual Ventures have come up with a sci-fi sounding innovation called ""StratoShield"".
 Fancy science terms aside, the general idea is to put huge balloons up in the stratosphere to hose out sulphurdioxide to brighten the skies of Earth. The problem with this ""solution"" is that it will result in some irregular weather patterns (as major volcano eruptions have shown), meaning one part of the world will probably have to deal with more extreme weather and rain patterns whilst the rest only will have to deal with brighter clouds. I fear I don't have enough space to argue further here, but do look at the link on geoengineering.

*Fracking:* Indeed, fracking has enabled the production and extraction of huge amounts of natural gas. This has made fossil fuels much, much cheaper than they were before, resulting in less investments in green energy (when it comes down to it, most companies pick the cheaper option - especially if the cheapest is marketed as ""green"").
The problem with fracking is that it pollutes like one in hell. There's a huge amount of toxic chemicals involved in the fracking process, which have to condense in huge condensing tubs. Fracking is also a high risk factor when it comes to preserving clean water resources. The documentary about the subject called ""Gaslands"" is highly recommended.
Regarding the reduction in CO2 emissions: I'm sorry to say, but gas only played a minor role in that. If you look at their graph at 5:13 you can see the emissions have been dropping for a while. Why? Because a lot of industry have been outsourced to Asia or other countries outside of the US, reducing the need for energy. The emissions of China, however, have only continued to increase. The significant drop around 2008 is also because of the financial crisis, most likely.
Now, another problem with fracking gas is that it isn't all green. There's a huge amount of gas lost into the atmosphere through the fracking process. The industry reported emissions are way lower than those observed by scientists. Not surprisingly when you wan't to make money in the process. CH4 (aka Methane) has been found to trap ""86 times as much heat has CO2 over a 20 year period"". This significantly reduces it's environmental friendliness. And this is just Ch4 fracking. I could go on for hours on the bitumen fracking going on in Alberta.

Prager, we all want to watch good content. Do better next time and drop the pseudo facts and strawmen. Please.

First point: If it is proven scientifically that humans are the primary cause of climate change i still am highly skeptical of the doomsday part and would say that we still need to use fossil fuels but perhaps we could restrict emissions more with local policy.
Second Point: it is proven that the apocalypse is incoming from climate change but not clear humans are primary cause. Then we need to get to high ground.
Finally: i guess what you believe that humans are fossil fueling our way to the end of civilization. We go to war with China and India and Russia to stop their pollution.

You address a couple separate points here. Im confused as to when i referred you to another post i just read all my posts o this thread and i cannot find it just chalk it up to confusion idk i post all over the internet though... all of these technologies you mentioned if they produce electricity more competitively than fossil fuels without any intervention by government at all then I'm all for them! Otherwise we should burn all fossil fuels while advancing fusion technology. A big core of my argument is that solar wind and bio energy are so far off from providing all of the massive energy required to maintain all the post industrial economies on Earth that they are a waste of time and effort and i shouldnt be forced to invest in it with my tax payer money. 
However in my own limited research just now canadian wind energy is HEAVILY SUBSIDIZED and more expensive than fossil fuel based energy. This isnt better than fossil fuel and therefore isnt real ""progress"" its a political power grab imo. 
Now the end of your post seems like your saying science is mostly a consensus driven methodology. It is not. I dont care how many scientists provided predictions 15 years ago which have not come close to true. When i was in school when your hypothesis is challenged you question it not the data.

I replied to your post that said ""If it's not the cheapest I don't want anything to do with it"". You asked me to read the whole post, but there wasn't anything else there. If I missed anything please let me know where to find it. Or did you refer to this post you wrote now?

Now, as for your points:

I agree that nuclear energy is a way to reduce carbon emissions in the immediate future. As would be fusion, but that appears to be quite a bit off. I'm not opposed to finding a holistic solution that includes any and all available options. But the point is that we need to act now. Like, right now. 

Waiting a decade or two for fusion reactors to become viable might be too late, and sadly, fission reactors usually require on the magnitude of one decade from first plans to first power as well due to the amount of planning, safety and security required. That doesn't mean we shouldn't build any, it just means we need to look at faster ways to reduce carbon emissions as well.

I live in a country that has built a renewable energy infrastructure over the last decade, and what has transpired here is this: As you said, renewables alone can not provide a 24/7 production, not without backup and storage. As for backup and load leveling, the most cost-effective and (incidentally) also most climate-friendly fossil fuel technology is gas turbines for electricity. For even better efficiency, their waste heat can be used to power A/Cs via local steam and/or hot water distribution networks. We also found here that wind energy is profitable. It did take a while to get there, admittedly, but it is now.

As for storage, there are a number of technologies that can be used. You mentioned hydrogen which can be produced from water and electricity easily, but is kinda iffy to handle (I can expand on that if you like, but it would be a separate post, kinda longish subject). However, we actually can produce new oil and gas. Methane (a.k.a. natural gas) can be produced using the Sabatier process, which in turn can be used to produce liquid hydrocarbons via the Fischer-Tropsch process. So the technology to store electricity is well developed and there, and is actually in use in Europe.

I understand your argument with profitability and investment, but I don't understand why you think that investing in technology that isn't quite ready yet and may take decades, like new nuclear fission and fusion technologies combined with continuing to burn coal in the meantime is better than investing in what is already there. I don't know why Billionaires and Hollywood aren't investing there. Maybe it's not sexy and flashy, or maybe they are investing but aren't making a fuss about it because development there has long entered the consolidation phase where the ROI isn't being able to say ""I'm an innovator"", but instead actual money. Even your own government (specifically the Energy Information Administration, eia. gov)says that wind energy is the cheapest way to produce energy in 2017, and I assume their data does not include subsidies.

Okay lastly I'd like to address the elephant in the room. What if climate change is real, and what if science is right and we either act now or we're pretty much committing suicide? Considering that the vast majority of science does say exactly that, is it really so completely unlikely that that may actually be accurate and true? Lets assume for a moment it is, proven beyond the shadow of a doubt. Would you then be willing to spend more on your energy in order to keep ourselves alive? 

I'm looking forward to your thoughts on my comments. Cheers.",1.0,1.0,,47bNzLj5E_Q,

That we're completely ignoring the potential, connection between carbon dioxide, the Earth's atmosphere, the greenhouse effect, global temperatures, ocean acidification, and sea-level rise. From a long-term point of view, we'd still need to plan for our energy future. Fossil fuels, which make up by far the majority of world-wide power today, are an abundant but fundamentally limited resource. Renewable sources like wind, solar, and hydroelectric power have different limitations: they're inconsistent. There is a long-term solution, though, that overcomes all of these problems: nuclear fusion. 
It might seem that the fossil fuel problem is obvious: we cannot simply generate more coal, oil, or natural gas when our present supplies run out. We've been burning pretty much every drop we can get our hands on for going on three centuries now, and this problem is going to get worse. Even though we have hundreds of years more before we're all out, the amount isn't limitless. There are legitimate, non-warming-related environmental concerns, too. On the other hand, renewable energy sources are inconsistent, even at their best. Try powering your grid during dry, overcast (or overnight), and drought-riddled times, and you're doomed to failure. The sheer magnitude of the battery storage capabilities required to power even a single city during insufficient energy-generation conditions is daunting. Simultaneously, the pollution effects associated with creating solar panels, manufacturing wind or hydroelectric turbines, and (especially) with creating the materials needed to store large amounts of energy are tremendous as well. Even what's touted as ""green energy"" isn't devoid of drawbacks. So far, fission has taken place in either a runaway or controlled environment, rushing past the breakeven point (where the energy output is greater than the input) with ease, while fusion has never reached the breakeven point in a controlled setting. But four main possibilities have emerged.
First, Inertial Confinement Fusion. We take a pellet of hydrogen — the fuel for this fusion reaction — and compress it using many lasers that surround the pellet. The compression causes the hydrogen nuclei to fuse into heavier elements like helium, and releases a burst of energy
Second, Magnetic Confinement Fusion. Instead of using mechanical compression, why not let the electromagnetic force do the confining work? Magnetic fields confine a superheated plasma of fusible material, and nuclear fusion reactions occur inside a Tokamak-style reactor.
Next, Magnetized Target Fusion. In MTF, a superheated plasma is created and confined magnetically, but pistons surrounding it compress the fuel inside, creating a burst of nuclear fusion in the interior.
Finally, Subcritical Fusion. Instead of trying to trigger fusion with heat or inertia, subcritical fusion uses a subcritical fission reaction -- with zero chance of a meltdown -- to power a fusion reaction.
The first two have been researched for decades now, and are the closest to the coveted breakeven point. But the latter two are new, with the last one gaining many new investors and start-ups this decade.
Even if I reject climate religion, the problem of powering the world, and doing so in a sustainable, pollution-free way, is one of the most daunting long-term ones facing humanity. Nuclear fusion as a power source has never been given the necessary funding to develop it to fruition, but it's the one physically possible solution to our energy needs with no obvious downsides. If we can get the idea that ""nuclear"" means ""potential for disaster"" out of our heads, people from all across the political spectrum just might be able to come together and solve our energy and environmental needs in one single blow. If you think the government should be investing in science with national and global payoffs, you can't do better than the ROI that would come from successful fusion research. The physics works out beautifully; we now just need the investment and the engineering breakthroughs. 
If you read the whole post I appreciate it and I'd like to have a real debate about this without being called a sociopathic murderer because i think its important for things to actually be efficient i.e. PROFITABLE. Believe me if these green renewable energies were truly efficient then guys like Zuckerberg, Soros, Bill Gates and many Hollywood players would be investing in them. Not to mention us evil capitalists. But even with a lot of government ""juicing"" these technologies, when in competition with fossil fuels, are still failing.",2.0,1.0,,47bNzLj5E_Q,

a) Green energy IS cheaper. That's because much of the cost of fossil fuel is either deferred or hidden. It's the cost incurred by people having to move away from a fracking area because the water from their has suddenly become combustible. It's the cost if rising insurance premiums due to more frequent and more intense natural disaster events. It's the cost of having to move entire nations because rising sea water levels flooded their islands. 

However, even without theses hidden costs, wind energy has been cheaper than any other source of electricity (in $ per MWh), except for natural gas, for several years, and this year (2017) it has actually become cheaper than any other source of electricity, period. Solar isn't fully there yet, but it's cheaper than coal already and prices are falling steadily.

The amount of the solar rebate subsidy varies by program, but some are generous enough to cover up to 30% of your solar power system cost.
The federal government allows you to deduct 30% of your solar power system costs off your federal taxes through an investment tax credit (ITC). If you do not expect to owe taxes this year, you can roll over your federal solar tax credit to the following year.
These incentives dramatically lower the cost of a solar panel system or energy efficiency project. These solar tax credits and rebates often make solar power less expensive than power from the utility company.
However, these programs are designed to reward early adopters of solar power and energy efficiency, so the energy rebate amount per home continues to drop as the allotted funds are consumed. Some locations have additional incentives to make solar even more affordable.",0.0,1.0,,47bNzLj5E_Q,

The hydrogen gas was then burned to generate energy, a process that reconstituted the water molecules. According to Meyer, the device required less energy to perform electrolysis than the minimum energy requirement predicted or measured by conventional science. The mechanism of action was alleged to involve ""Brown's gas"", a mixture of oxyhydrogen with a ratio of 2:1, the same composition as liquid water; which would then be mixed with ambient air (nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, methane, chloroflourocarbons, free radicals/electrons, radiation, among others). If the device worked as specified, it would violate both the first and second laws of thermodynamics, allowing operation as a perpetual motion machine. In 1996 Meyer was sued by two investors to whom he had sold dealerships, offering the right to do business in Water Fuel Cell technology. His car was due to be examined by the expert witness Michael Laughton, Professor of Electrical Engineering at Queen Mary, University of London and Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering. However, Meyer made what Professor Laughton considered a ""lame excuse"" on the days of examination and did not allow the test to proceed. According to Meyer, the technology was patent pending and under investigation by the patent office, the Department of Energy and the military. His ""water fuel cell"" was later examined by three expert witnesses in court who found that there ""was nothing revolutionary about the cell at all and that it was simply using conventional electrolysis."" The court found Meyer had committed ""gross and egregious fraud"" and ordered him to repay the two investors their $25,000. Meyer's patents have expired. His inventions are now in the public domain, available for all to use without restriction or royalty payment. Despite this, no engine or vehicle manufacturer has incorporated Meyer's work.

_Not everyone believes women should be equal under the law,_

You know, I recently watched a Steven Pinker lecture on YT where he said we shouldn't write in that paranoid academic lingo, because we can assume that the reader is intelligent enough that when we say ""everyone"" we will not be nailed down to literally mean every last person on earth, and I agree with him, but I certainly got a feeling where writing like that comes from!


_even in the US._

I don't live in the US, but yes I'm certain also in the US. Not just literally everybody in the US, just all the people you reasonably have to expect to meet more than once in your life or be relevant socially.

Is *anybody* excluded from *everybody* _that matters_? If you are not argueing for that, you argue for semantics.

Who is that somebody who opposes equal protection we need to concern ourselves with?

We don't get anywhere here when we are pedantic in logical formalization and you don't want me to start with that anyway!

_That constitutional amendment was never passed._
If that causes any problems I'm sure they can be fixed. Do you mention this for some specific reason?


_Specifically, the privacy rights of women are still under contention through reproductive rights._

lol

That ""specifically"" reads like an outright insult here. But I take it as a joke for now, because I don't sense any hostile intentions.

You could however phrase a complex and controversial proposition as an argument, that would help in the fruitful exchange of ideas.


_Globally, women face even more inequality,_

Again, the context was clear and you understood it, if you are honest. I was not speaking of women in Saudi Arabia and nobody would misunderstand me in that way. It does not really need clarifying. I'm not part of the political process of Saudi Arabia, and we are not going to invade them anytime soon, and if we ever do, probably not for feminist reasons.

_and feminists frequently actively engage these issues._

In secret meetings? For me, it just begs the question, if feminists allow themselves the luxary of making a political movement into an 'academic' discipline, why does that discipline never produce anything of value *that ever reaches the public*?

I don't study physics but I sure love my computer. I studied philosophy but people who did not can still enjoy democracy and the rule of law. I study mathematics now but the people who don't still can enjoy... civilzation. (You're welcome, folks).

I wouldn't deny that there are feminist who are concerned about that. Indeed there are a lot. But they never really seem to do anything that informs the public how to help. Maybe some quietely and humbely do hands on good work and help the woman directly were they life.

That would be great and could legitmately called ""feminism"". It's not what the term means in common usage, though.

_If we all agree on those points, then we are all Feminists._

Then also the term makes no sense. Doesen't matter how you argue for the proposition that that description is obsolete. I'm not an anti-slaverist, because slavery is illegal in my country and there is no need to fight it apart from stopping human trafficing. That's just called being ""pro law&order"".

Words need to distinguish to some degree to be helpful.


_If you disagree with specific movements within feminism, you're still a feminist in the same way conservatives can disagree with movements within conservatism but still both be conservatives. It all comes down to how specific you are when describing your ideas._


You are correct in that observation, but I simply hold the position that any cause worth fighting for today does not warrent labeling oneself a ""feminist"". (Except the aforementioned act of selflessly migrating to Saudi Arabia to help women there).

Not all people are conservatives. It's a helpful word because it distinguishes yourself from, for example revolutionary or libertine. What exactly does one archieve to label oneself a feminist, apart from attaching onself to the ones that made a horrible public image in recent years?


_It seems to me you are saying you consider yourself a feminist, but you don't know how to specify what kind you are._

No, I don't consider myself a feminst, not only because I find it trivial but also because my endorsement of equal protection is not birthed by any special concern for women, but out of a concern for principle. I do not want woman to be equal because reasons, I want to life in a society with the rule of law and equal protection. That is only possible if you do not deny rights everybody else has on the basis of race, gender, religion,.... whatever.*

I am entirely selfish and do not fight politically for the wellbeing of strangers. (At least not that much) I just see their wellbeing as a condition for mine and that of the people close to me.

_You probably agree with many feminists entirely and some feminists partly._

Yes, that is entirely possible! But that does not make ""feminist"" as a description helpful in communication, or makes me close to certain other ideas.


_Due to this common ground, it's counterproductive to dismiss the whole movement as cancerous._

You are entitled to that opinion, but I disagree. If feminists want to be taken serious _as feminists_, and maintain it as some sort of identity, they have to communicate differently when they enter the public sphere. And they also seem to need to organize themselves first. If you want to rally people for that, then you have to state clearly what your cause is.

_Instead of being entirely reactionary,_

Reactionary in what sense?

_you can (and probably occasionally do) contribute constructively to feminist dialouge._

There is no forum for that. _Of course_ that's no problem, because there is a forum for that. But that is hard to find and apparently the mangement there is weak in the PR department, because they don't hype many people to find them.

_Ask feminists you disagree with why they believe what they do and explain your beliefs and why they disagree with theirs._

What else would you do? But as I mentioned, everytime I meet somebody self-identifying as ""feminist"" that person also endorses psychoanalysis, which makes rational discourse impossible, or better said, one-sided very quickly.


_When you're dismissive it just makes you seem uninformed._
Not really. I'm kind of a nationalist. But that then again, I'm kind of not, because for different but similar reasons than with feminism, that description is kind of unhelpful.

I think a nation state is the largest community of humans that can functionally organize. Most nationalist don't try to make that case, don't argue for it very well, or rather try to make the case for very bad other things why we should live in nation states.

Are people that opposed nationalism uninformed? Kind of, but it's not *their* fault. It's my fault and the fault of nationalist in general that nationalism has a bad name and is seen as knee-jerk and simplistic. Hitler put more effort into adovocating to public than I ever did. Really not fair to blame the public for that. It's my fault not to have presented a strong alternative to Hitler.

Also, if you think Hitler was a dick (again, very commonly hold believe, and it's not the public's fault to come to that conclusion), you can't seriously be against people being sceptical and not blindly join movements.",1.0,1.0,,47bNzLj5E_Q,

The Science is actually pretty clear and solid. There is almost no refute to what I am telling you. World Watch, FAO, EPA, USDA, UN, Greenpeace, etc all of them acknowledge this is true. No one tries to contradict that livestock is a major if not the major cause. The thing is it is not the popular route to go with. It doesn't get as much exposure for that same reason. People won't even believe climate change in your country (I'm guessing you are from the US), now imagine telling them to stop eating meat because of something they don't believe in.

First you can mazke tank armor and shit, you can make ammo, but most importantly, you can renew it. If you put the nuclear waste in a giant bath for 50years, you can use it again. And secondly, there wouldn't be any need to change all the fosil fuel factories, because a nuclear power plant makes a shit ton of power. To put things into a perspective, amma give you a example. (theese are real numbers)

The smalest nuclear powerplant in the us generates 508 MW, adn the largest in the US generates  3,973 MW

whilst a avrage coal powerplant generates 646 MW (theese are from my calculations, but should be about right)

However, the coeal powerplant is less eficient interms of costs. A nuclear powerplant costs 2,10 cents per MWH. (MWH=how much energy something produces in 1 hour) Whilst a coal powerplant costs 3,23 cents.

I agree with everything there although I have no problem with them giving voice to skeptic viewpoints like that oil video (pretty sure I watched it and it didn't seem to make any large claims).

My main issue is with the amount of public money being demanded and it has been from the start of all this 20 years ago.

For example when you look at the penetration of electric vehicles over the next few decades it is going to boom to the point where there are hardly any gasoline cars, in my estimation.  And that has been clear for a long time because of the way electric motors and batteries were becoming cheap and energy dense (especially in remote control industry).

Yet the IPCC basically ignores that and doesn't work it into their calculations.  Nor do they try to forecast the cost of solar or the density of batteries.  Instead they dishonestly try to make the problem appear as bad as possible by ignoring any positive aspects.  And it's not just the IPCC but virtually all of the left who ignore this.

Technology can solve the issue with virtually no government intervention, except to make it easy to create new green manufacturing businesses free of unnecessary regulation.  That's obviously my opinion but it deserves much more analysis from the left rather than trying to sweep it under the carpet.",0.0,1.0,,47bNzLj5E_Q,

I think one reason why private investors put these 7 billion into green energy research in the first place, was that they knew the government would subsidize them, once they're produced. Without that, they'd have less incentive to innovate.

So I think we should both subsidize green energy, and also directly subsidize green energy innovation, especially nuclear fusion. Nuclear *fission* already did way more for cutting emissions than non-nuclear green energy, and once our rockets are like 99.9% safe (which is once private space travel is used to put people into space regularly, which seems to be happening relatively soon, based on what SpaceX is doing), we can simply dump our nuclear waste into space. And of course nuclear *fission* wouldn't create any waste at all, so that'd be even better.

People arguing your side just plug their ears and deny that man-made climate change even _exists_, despite the overwhelming amount of evidence and reporting of consistent findings by scientists worldwide. We _know_ that human CO2 emission is directly having an effect on the climate and contributing to increased temperatures, here it is broken down:
More energy is remaining in Earth's atmosphere (global temperatures are higher, this is simple fact).
CO2 is a greenhouse gas that traps energy in the atmosphere.
CO2 has increased 50% in the last 150 years, the result of burning fossil fuels.
*The energy being trapped in the atmosphere corresponds exactly to the wavelengths of energy captured by CO2.* – this is the smoking gun that directly ties the trends to human activity

If there is one underlying common threat in conservative politics since Reagan it is the demonization and proud dismantling of government, taxation, and regulation.  It is the most consistent political position of conservatives for the past 40 years.

""US gov healthcare is working like shit,""

The US is literally the only developed nation on earth that does not offer public healthcare to everyone.  The fact that healthcare sucks in the US is proof for what I'm saying, that markets can't allocate properly for them.  But boy is it lucrative. What you have is a bunch of thugs who pay off politicians to ensure there is no public option so people are up a creek spending endless amounts on deductibles and coinsurance while funding marketing and profits that wouldn't be there under a public system.  Health insurance's largest cost is determined by risk being spread out over a greater number.  The largest risk pool is everyone (hence public insurance).  The benefits a market can offer here doesn't really mean much other than administrative efficiency.  

""Also, Private sector can provide anything gov sector provides.""

Learn some basics first before you regurgitate stupid claims that come from pro-industry talking points.

""Do u want me to list regulations and since taxation exists it not anarcho-capitalism for everyone else. ""

The current trend is heading in this direction massively.  The rich pay little to not taxes but since they still have most of the capital.  This means that when the govt needs revenues it creates treasuries that the rich wind up buying ultimately anyway.  This means the ultra-rich get paid interest on monies they provide for government while taxes are for suckers like you and I.  In the U.S. we have ""tough love"".  ""Love"" for the rich and ""tough"" for everyone else.

""Ur lying seeing how you don't even know the definition of things like socialism.""

I am not lying.  I have two degrees in economics, a BA and an MA.  What did I say that made you believe I don't know what socialism means?  The government is socialist institution. It facilitates the means and production of goods and services through public ownership.  Every capitalist economy on earth, throughout history has socialism within it.  Socialism is not mutually exclusive from capitalism.  You need a private sector and a public sector. Getting the right balance is important.  However, we have been experiencing a 40 year propaganda campaign against government through the republican party culminating in Trump.",0.0,1.0,,47bNzLj5E_Q,

Being a retired auto mechanic I drive 2 18 year old vehicles that are still in very good condition. Yet there are those who would chide me for not driving a more  modern and more environmentally friendly fuel efficient vehicle because I can afford it.

""That could only have merit if natural emission and the absorption rate of all natural sinks rates were static, when they have fluctuated wildly and are never in balance. ""

This is like arguing that we can't know if people can cause fires because there have been fires long before humans. We know the cause of the most recent rise in CO2 because we know the flux, we have direct measurements of the atmosphere and fossil fuel based CO2 has their own unique signatures. We also know that for many years before modernization that CO2 levels were static or decreasing. keep in mind that we only produced 3% of the total flux relatively recently and the world population has grown quite a bit in recent history, not even close to what it was 2100 years ago.

""when the debate is actually how much of an impact does man have on it.""

This would be a statistical claim though, heck even the Exxon scientists indicated we wouldn't have expected temperatures to rise outside of what could be dismissed as natural noise till 1995. The most anyone could hope to claim is primary causes. This is is why looking at how it's warming is relevant and why the instrumental record is pretty much the only way to test recent warming. That is unless you think all forms of warming have the exact same fingerprints regardless of source. Well to be fair they could also tell you the additional energy you'd expect in the system just from the increase in CO2, but that's a bit different than just temperature increase because that energy goes into several things.",0.0,1.0,,47bNzLj5E_Q,

I'm guessing that the corpses you're talking about is referring to animals?  Start at the top?  Okay.  It's not slavery that's encouraged in the Bible - and certainly not slavING.  Are there quotes that - out of context - seem like slavery is encouraged?  Sure.  Probably cherry pick the emancipation proclamation and find something similar.  I went through a site that someone posted about how the Jews are slavers, and how it's in the Bible...  Not slaves, indentured servants.  Wives, not slaves (wives have value, are treated relatively equally, etc.), even someone from another country who got killed for slavery and they thought it was Israel.  Try to read the surrounding text to get the whole picture before basing a whole argument on it.
It can definitely be healthy to eat animal flesh, just as it can be detrimental.  Same goes for veganism.  It's not the cult you need to follow.  There are consequences to not following God.  

'and there is no institution of atheism claiming moral authority.' - And yet, most atheists claim a moral superiority solely because they do no believe in any god, let alone God.

'But you can't deny the mayority of people using religion to stay ignorant and even if you are using critical thinking, you can't proceed to claim that the bible has any validity in today's day and age.' - Have you noticed how often people respond to 'you can't deny...' with a strong denial?  I don't know that that's what you're trying to set up, but it seems like you are.  I would guess that the majority of people aren't using religion to stay ignorant as a goal.  Why you would think that, I don't know.  Using critical thinking - 'the objective analysis and evaluation of an issue in order to form a judgment' - I'd say that the Bible (and Christianity as a whole) has a lot of validity in any time period you'd like to mention.  Atheistic leaders have killed more people than all religions combined.  Morality might just be important.

'but claiming to have any answers about metaphysics is ridiculous and is deterring so many people from seeking answers and they just accept things the way they are.' - I'm not sure you meant this the way it sounds.  If I claim any answers about metaphysics, they'd have to be brought up separately (even though it's sort of a narrow field, it covers a lot of territory).  The part I wonder about is how religious people accept things as they are.  Not saying we don't, but you're saying that atheists don't?  Cars don't exist?  The earth not only isn't round, but it isn't even in existence?  Maybe you want to state that a little more clearly?

'So many childeren never learn the wonders of biology, chemistry and even mathematics, because it is explained with: 'God did it'.' - Tell me, Hemel:  What color is the sky in your world?  2 + 2 = 4 because God did it?  I'm not saying that God didn't set up the world in which that's true, but not thinking at all?  'Sure there are some accomplished religious scientist in these fields, but i think there would be more and better scientist if we get rid of religion.' - Have you looked at the history of science?  How many scientists were God fearing folk?  In practically all areas of thought?  You think we'd be better scientists if we lost all of morality and decency and just got on with pure science!?  Are you trying to lead me to say stupid things like you're doing?  I am not anti science:  I think it's a wonderful way to explain some of the ways God's world w*rks.  It is not my religion.

'The morals from the bible are so minimal and in my opinion they add nothing.' - Can you point to a moral you agree with that isn't in the Bible?  Can you point to a moral that you don't agree with that is in the Bible?

' A five year old could come up with this code of ethics and even if we needed religion to reach this, that doesn't mean we should keep using it.' - And yet these values are not universal, and are mocked in most areas with no religion.  Even today.

'It's easy to create a little bit of doubt in science but it can't compete with the overwhelming amount of evidence.' - What's the scientific method?  Idea, model, test, assess?  Something like that?  If there's doubt as to whether the model w*rks, why would you keep using the model?  Even if parts of the model w*rk, the model as a while needs to be looked at so you don't continue to promote falsehood.  Certainly, you wouldn't want to continue to build on flawed models:  That would lead to ruin, right?

' Maybe it started of as a simple way to get rid of waste build up and later evolved to adding a catalyst to the two waste products, which is required for every chemical reaction, and it just happen to explode.' - We'll start with 'how many miracles does it take for your theory to w*rk', and move on to 'how many of these beetles died (and therefore didn't pass on the genes) before the safe mechanism for accurately delivering a binary explosive came about by accident?

'Religion has held society together forever.'- You are right the basic morals, like no stealing, no lying, no killing, made society possible. A five year old could come up with this code of ethics and even if we needed religion to reach this, that doesn't mean we should keep using it.

You seem like a nice guy and wish you luck with going vegetarian, you can buy plenty of fake meats in the supermarket. But like many animal product, there are tasty and disgusting ones. You really should look into the horrors of the egg and diary industry, e.g. cows need to be pregnant to produce milk and their babies are taken away from them as soon as possible, the males go into the veal industrie (yes, people eat baby cow) and some females aswell or they go through the same process as their mother, where they are being worked to death to produce as much milk as possible (for contrast, it's like human females having their period every single day, because cows have been bred to produce that much more milk than they naturally would) and then they get their throat slit when they are 7 years old, because they don't produce enough milk anymore.

The information's there for people - likely misinformation on both sides - and they can draw their own conclusions.'- I don't epect you to take my word for it, that's why i don't go into too much detail and i always epect people to do their own research. The statements that i have made are statements made by the World Health Organisation from the United Nations the leading authority on health in the world. The problem with science is you can never ever proof something a 100% (no, really, you cant even proof the theory of gravity 100%). That is why you have to look at the quality and quantity of the evidence, so there is one right conclussion and the rest is wrong.
It helps not to base your conclussion on easy to understand summerized information (like Prageru), but looking up the actual scientific peer reviewed studies (can't deny that most information is biased, but with common sense and attention, it's easy to see through it).

How many people do you know who have diabetes, heart decease or cancer, if you don't you will, it's the leading cause of death in the western world and they are dietary deceases. Now you can still get sick and die on a vegan diet even if you do it right, just like how someone can get lungcancer but never smoke a cigarette in their life, genetics always play a part. Veganism isn't just about ethics, it's also about your own health.  

Now, changing your diet from death and destruction to a plantbased one is easier said than done. I always recommend cutting out meat first and worry about animal by-products later. It's not uncommen to spend 5 years working on it, especially if you have a full-time job. That is why most people fail, they change out of emotions instead of reason. And again, there are 7 billion people on the planet assuming 1% is vegan is a fair estimate, that's 70 million vegans. Plenty of examples on how to do it and how not to do it, even here on youtube we have a couple of vegan bodybuilder showing you what to eat, you just have to look for it and avoid pseudoscience, like raw vegans and fruitarians.",0.0,1.0,,47bNzLj5E_Q,

'And there is no proof we can't get everything we need from plants? Millions of people have already done it.' - Millions?  I know of people who have tried it and failed, and I know of people who have done it successfully, but not millions.  

'A vegan diet can provide for every life stage (from pregnant women to world class athletes) The ONLY thing you need to suppplement is b12, it's a bacteria and you can just take a little pill everyday to get it.

'You will need to learn what to eat to stay healthy, unlike your religion, you will need to put in some work to be a decent human being.' - Yep.  My religion doesn't need w*rk to be decent, or to help people be decent human beings.  You got it in one.",0.0,1.0,,47bNzLj5E_Q,

Because, of course the God who sees into your heart and soul will absolutely not know that you're just mouthing the words to get forgiveness.  That's not remotely how any of it w*rks.  You need to be convinced that you are doing wrong, you need to repent (which is a bit deeper than just saying you're sorry and asking for forgiveness), and then you can move on.

' Polluting the planet, torturing and murdering animals for greed to the point where people on the other side of the planet are starving to death is unforgiveable.' - China is Christian now?  I hadn't heard that.  Really?!  These are things you associate with Christianity?  Look at, golly, EVERY CIVILIZED COUNTRY and you'll find this happening.  Christianity is not the factor that causes this.  At worst, it's not interested in stopping it.  

'This is what Prageru is preaching in the name of your religion. The world is on fire and religious conservatives want to pretend we are doing enough.' - No.  I would like to see a solution that isn't merely taking money from the rich.  It's not even a solution to the problem.  If giving up half of what everyone owned would solve the problem, I wouldn't have an issue with it (or, at least, not much of one).  Everything they've said solves nothing, and is merely a power grab and an attempt at virtue signalling.  I am not in favor of green energy because it will save the planet, the monkeys, the dolphins, or anything of the sort.  I would simply like to step outside and not worry about the air I'm breathing.  I support measures that move towards this, and call out measures that not only do nothing towards that, but remove any money I might have had to donate to charities.  
It would be very nice if they could come up with a solution that didn't kill third worlders, too.

'We can get everything we need from plants and if your smart you can make it just as delicious as your diet of death and destruction.' - So we just kill all the animals we have set aside for food and let them rot?  That's your solution?  I would like to see how people can get everything they need from plants and plants alone; 'cause last I heard, they were missing a bit from their diet.  I am in no way saying that the carnivore industry needs to be anywhere near as big as it is, but until I see some proof, I'm going with meat.
