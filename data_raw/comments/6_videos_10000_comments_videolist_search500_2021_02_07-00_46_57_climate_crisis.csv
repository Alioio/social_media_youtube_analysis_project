A good example is the 97% of all scientists agree or the “extinction” of the polar bear. I am well aware of global warming and we do have influence on it. (Co2). But stating that the science is settled is never ever correct. It is a fact that there are a lot of scientists who don’t agree on the current theory of us being the main reason for global warming. If you want to win an argument with a global warming denier. Try and find the scientific articles that deny our influence on it. The best way to win a war is to look thru your opponents eyes. You will find that not everything they say is wrong. And they will use that to confirm their story. Trust me, if you really research global warming. Maybe you will understand them a bit.

Remove the atmosphere/GHGs and the earth becomes much like the moon, a barren rock with a 0.1 albedo, 20% more kJ/h, hot^3 on the lit side, cold^3 on the dark. Nikolov, Kramm (U of AK) and UCLA Diviner mission all tacitly agree. 

2) the GHG up/down welling, “trapping”/”back” radiating/delaying/intercepting, 100 % efficient, perpetual warming loop requires ""extra"" energy which according to RGHE theory it gets from 

3) the terrestrial surface radiating that ""extra"" energy as a near ideal .95 emissivity black body which

Second it is self reported so there are a host of problems that might creep in. On to my own read. Their three groups skeptics, cautiously worried, and highly concerned are not defined in the obvious way by an answer to a particular set of questions. Instead the groups are defied by how there beliefs changed over the course of the study, but no reason for change (other then seasons) is suggested. This opens a number of possibilities for the groupings: perhaps people who click through randomly, for example are classed together.  The structure of the test is ver poorly motivated as a change in belief over time this question they seem to be answering doesn’t obviously require repeated studies. This tells me they were probably looking at a different question when the study started. This is typical of PhD projects ( I think this is the lead authors dissertion) where the research doesn’t show anything else that is interesting.

Can we act in our own best interests, or has fear has generated such a strong ‘us vs them’ tribal response in ourselves that rational cooperation is unlikely? How much has our innate survival instinct been co-opted by fear and its allies, denial and anger.

Anger and hatred makes one feel stronger and is but a temporary antidote to feeling fearful and weak. It’s what ‘moves in and takes over’ when denial isn’t enough by itself to assuage one’s fears. But the reality of the danger keeps ‘rearing its ugly head’ and the ever increasing levels of angst and the resultant anger ‘boils over’ into overt displays.

Example: Global warming calls for the curtailing of fossil fuel consumption & the Covid pandemic requires the implementation of public health protocols to combat the Covid virus.  Both of these issues are resisted by rigid thinkers. Denial of the source of these dangers in order to ‘combat fear’ actually winds up increasing the dangers. This further increases fear levels, which then ramps up denial, which results in even more danger. The vicious cycle continues until a ‘shit storm’ finally manifests. And when two or more such storms merge and become one, a ‘perfect storm’ ensues, such as the Summer 2020 riots which resulted from the combined angst concerning global warming, the Covid pandemic and a host of social issues (e.g.. policing problems). And this is just one spiral in a building global storm.

Example of denial:
“...a registered emergency room nurse from South Dakota, told folks online about patients who test positive and still deny that COVID is what's making them so ill...”

Let’s see,.....Step 1 ask questions-So what is the difference between science and pseudoscience?  Which of the two would you consider the current study of man made global warming?  Please spend some time looking this answer up before moving on.  I won’t answer it for you but I  can lead you in the right direction.  I recommend a YouTube search for Nobel Laureate Ivar Giaever.  He gives a 31 minute lecture on the subject and I think it was worth it to watch every minute of it.  
Step 2 tell a story- There once was a boy who cried “wolf.”  We will call him Al.  He told the villagers that the wolf was going to gore his sheep.  He said it would happen in less than one decade.  When it didn’t happen then he said it would happen in the next decade and then the next.  Then some of the smarter villagers stopped believing him.  But it was too late.  They had already bought all of Al’s wolf traps, wolf repellant, wolf poison, and ammunition.  Al retired in a life of luxury and moved to beachfront property in California in a giant mansion using ungodly amounts of electricity.  (Maybe he will be underwater soon, ya right 🙄.)  Someone should have told the villagers that there were no wolves on their island only 90 miles south of Key West.  Moral of the story - Don’t trust Al or you will become a broke peasant stuck in a Socialist / Communist country.  The End 🙂.  I like story telling.  
Step 3 Be Equipped.  I went to the Skeptical Science web page and learned all of the ridiculous rebuttals to my arguments and now I have rebuttals to your rebuttals.  For example, I say polar bears are doing just fine.  Then you run to the bathroom and look up your webpage.  It says to counter with “polar bears are at risk of extinction”.  Then I say,  if overall population has increased possibly from 1000 in 1970 to 25,000 today how are carbon emissions hurting them?  Then you counter with “sub populations are decreasing even if the total number is increasing.”  And then I say, that is a ridiculous argument.  Are we now going to count the equivalent of Hispanic polar bears which are increasing while Asian polar bears are decreasing”. And then we either laugh or cry hysterically.  🤣
However, after visiting the site, I can say the studies are PSEUDOSCIENCE run by PSEUDOSCIENTISTS.  Return to step one if you are confused right now.  
Step 4- Big ideological issue -follow the money!  Carbon credits, carbon tax, government mandated price on carbon, carbon trading. Hopefully Trump will complete our exit from the Paris agreement.  By the way, we breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide.  Plants and trees love it.  Most of them are starved for it.  If they could think, they would crave SUV emissions of carbon dioxide.  It is like oxygen to them.  So.....not so scary.  And the most scary molecule that makes up over 90% of greenhouse gases is......wait for it.........H2O.  Otherwise known as water 🤯😱.  I just delayed our future demise by trapping some of it in my body by drinking it.  But I apologize for taking a breath after each sip of water, thereby expelling CO2.  If you truly want to stop CO2 from being released into the environment, stop breathing.  That was only a joke please continue to breathe.  Try not to think about what you are exhaling.  
Step 5 show vulnerability-  I’m really scared that my children and future grand children and great grandchildren will have to pay a heavy tax on all things carbon so that a World government / Bank can gain more power and control of our lives💵💴💶💷💰.  One of the skeptical science articles showed the slow down of warming over the last 20 years where the global  temperature change was either negative, or a possible increase of 0.056 degrees C per decade.  That is despite a continual increase in carbon emissions.  SERIOUSLY?!!!!!  Not worth losing my freedom over.  🇺🇸

The Earth's Greenhouse effect of 34C is entirely a product of assuming the energy balance applies at the surface. The immediate question is why do we assume sea level is the correct surface? Why not include the sea bed, the average altitude of dry land, the tropopause or the clouds? All of these could arguably be a ""surface"".

Yet if we look at every world in the solar system that has an atmosphere we don't find a balance at 1 bar of pressure (Earth sea level pressure) anywhere. It is always higher up than that. The closest match is the top of the main cloud systems. Perhaps that represents the effective reach of atmospheric circulation for this problem.

The actual temperature balance for Earth is at about 5km up which is roughly consistent with the above. What this means is that the actual Greenhouse effect is much smaller than 34C. My hunch is that its in the bottom third of that range, 10C to 0C. That's right, it might be that it is actually zero and this whole business is based on applying the equations at the wrong altitude.

The temperature at any other altitude is then due to the lapse rate which is simply the normal temperature gradient you get going up or down through the atmosphere.

I have noticed that CO2 tends to emit radiation higher up the atmosphere but that does not mean heat lower down is ""trapped"". Also we don't know what the actual relationship between CO2 and temperature is, it is very difficult to claim that either one causes the other.

What about the graphs that show runaway rising temperatures? If you look at the sources they nearly always quote Marcott and Hadcrut. These are different, one is low frequency so it does not include decades long warming, the other is high frequency so it does. The main reason the graphs look different is that they represent different methods of dealing with the data.

Other graphs of past temperatures exist and they show a range of results. Alley and Mann for example show previous warm periods that look very like ours.

Overall it looks is if there are good reasons to doubt the doomsday messages and also to doubt large parts of the science, or to be more accurate the assumptions behind it and the way it is presented to us.",UCxLZlSa0T3t351xiLmeKixw,0.0,UgwcioUHsX6QuU8zGIx4AaABAg,9M29ns1rUSE,2019-11-13T17:00:03Z,climate crisis

This is why China will own the climate change agenda, and this is why China will reap the billions that are to be made from the climate change fight. You see, it doesn’t matter in one sense which side of the debate is right. Science or hunches. These initiatives will be implemented and they will go ahead without the US as a leader and this is excellent news for China who currently manufacture electric buses for the world, and are the largest photovoltaic manufacturer globally as well as being the largest vehicle battery manufacturer. This is just the beginning. For a capitalist country it’s surprising that the US is failing so badly in recognizing that this is one of the biggest market initiatives in history and the US will not be a recipient of the billions that will be made because the climate deniers seem to have the upper hand and are lead by a climate change denier.",UCb5iYG7eeSaR7QAGBW-oT5g,0.0,Ugzul3S22gm3X0o5Fp14AaABAg,9M29ns1rUSE,2019-11-13T17:00:03Z,climate crisis

Climates change of their own accord and is completely natural. It is hard to believe authorities when they sensationalize everything (which is done perpetually) concerning climate change. I remember around 2001 scientists saying that all of the beaches in Los Angeles were going to be underwater by 2016. This did not happen. Additionally we have passed several ""global warming points of no return"" claimed by environmental scientists. Once we pass these ""points of no return"" it seems everyone just forgets about it and creates a new one. There are people getting tremendously wealthy off of the green industrial complex and yet were not seeing any real solution for mitigating climate change after throwing trillions of dollars towards climate research scientists over decades. 

Many are resentful of the hypocrisy brought on from the green movement. Solar panel farms have displaced tons of animals. It's ok to burn biomass (trees) but not to log forests. Wind farms cost more money than they can produce electrically. For some reason, no one is willing to talk about nuclear energy as a viable option. Even Andrew Yang claimed that nuclear is the best green solution.

Lastly, science is greatly abused in the post modern era. In the minds of postmodern man, the very term ""science"" has a religious weight that is a very effective rhetorical device to get people to agree with you. Do not forget that science is directly derived and a part of philosophy and is expressly the scientific method being applied to a query. Beware of anyone who say ""the science says"" or ""science claims""; science can make no statements or speak for itself. Only people can make claims. People are commonly corrupt, ignorant, or lazy concerning science in the post modern period and it would be prudent for an individual to be skeptical of anyone using science as a rhetorical device.

1. In 1998 UN officials said that entire nations will be wiped out by the year 2000. = did not happen. 

2. In 1967 a book titled ""famine. America's decision: who will survive"" 
Supported by ""scientists."" Said that there would be global mass starvation by 1975. = did not happen. 

3. In 1982 Mostafa Tolba!, (the executive director of UN environment program) 
Said that there would be global catastrophe by the year 2000 similar to a ""nuclear holocaust."" 
= did not happen. 

4. 1970, Sen. Gaylord Nelson, often considered the “father of Earth Day”  believed that in 25 years, 75 and 80 percent of all the species of living animals will be extinct.”
= did not happen. 

5. In 2006, while promoting his movie “An Inconvenient Truth”, Al Gore (again supported by ""scientists"") said that humanity had only 10 years left. 
= did not happen. 

6. The U.N. officials also claimed: ""the most conservative scientific estimate is that the Earth’s temperature will rise 1 to 7 degrees in the next 30 years.”
But looking back from 2019, the temperature rose about half of a degree Celsius since 1989, according to NASA.  

7. ""Scientists"" Prof Peter Wadhams, of Cambridge University, and Prof Wieslaw Maslowski, of the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California; said that entire polar ice caps would melt by 2016. = did not happen.

What a condescending video. You think because someone is sceptical of falsified science is an idiot - I'm afraid I disagree.
 the only scientists that can conduct research are paid by the IPCC. If they find evidence that disputes climate change, then they are no longer financially supported by the IPCC, and no longer have enough backing to conduct research that refutes the agenda for climate change.

No. Genuinely, you should learn what Socialism actually is. Saying every socialist is evil for believing in Socialism, which led to the formation of totalitarian regimes around the world, is like saying every Christian is evil because christianity led to the Crusades which killed a bunch of people in Constantinople or saying all Muslims are bad because of ISIS and theocratic regimes. 
Not only do you come out guns blazing in true american fashion calling Socialism evil without even ever caring enough to know what it is, but you call socialists brainwashed and indoctrinated when the overwhelming majority of people in the are openly capitalists, meaning that it's basically impossible to be brainwashed by Communism when communist media is basically non-existent, whereas the US and Europe have been blasted with anti-Communist propaganda for the last century.
Since you probably aren't going to actually read up on Socialism, here's the basics in a nutshell: since Capitalism is flawed, we need to take it down and rebuild a society where people collaborate instead of trying to exploit each other. ""Capitalism is perfect!!!1!"", I hear you smashing into your keyboard. No it isn't, and here is the criticism Marx used, more or less. Rich people own the means of production (ie factories and materials), and since people can't get money without working and can't work without the means of production, rich people are free to exploit the poor with no consequences. Rich people still need to sell stuff they underpaid their workers to make, but since workers are underpaid they can barely afford food, so they can't buy anything. This means that factories have to stop producing, everyone is fired, there's a massive economic crisis.
Now that we have the flaws of capitalism out of the way, realize that without at least a little bit of government regulation (minimum wage, maximum work hours, tax curves) Capitalism would fall apart. We can sit here and argue how much we need to intervene in the economy, but Capitalism can't survive without constant adjustment.
""B-but, no, Communism is evil Russian and Chinese spies and soldiers finding innocents who aren't brainwashed yet and killing them in work camps! None of this misdirection! Communism has nothing to do with economy!"" Nope. Wrong again. All the atrocities committed by communist authoritarian regimes? Guess what, they happened because they were AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES by ruthless dictators, not because of Communism. What did Nazi Germany and the USSR have in common? Work camps and authoritarian regimes. Communism has nothing to do with it.
""But, no, Communists and Nazis are evil, that's why they would force people into concentration camps, that's why they made authoritarian regimes!"" Well, sort of. I will admit that Marxist doctrine does include a violent revolt by the proletariat against the status quo, so you might see that as a sign of evil. America was founded by a Revolution too though, and I don't see you condemning the US in any way, shape or form. The real issue is that coups and revolts are much easier when led by strong, charismatic leaders. Whoops now we have a dictatorship. But that has nothing to do with actual socialist beliefs, it just means that coups lead to dictatorships and dictatorships lead to suppression of minorities and opposition. Exactly what is happening in Russia right now, except that wait, Russia hasn't been communist for the last 30 years.",UClPu9Qdx3KbVmY1WDJ65V6g,1.0,UgwzZesGwteQC3eLKth4AaABAg,9M29ns1rUSE,2019-11-13T17:00:03Z,climate crisis

Not sure how in depth you learned about the Nazis and the Holocaust but Otto and Gregor Strasser grew the Nazi party by tying Hitler’s racist nationalism to socialist rhetoric that appealed to the suffering middle class. They gave them power when they were desperate for it. I never said I wanted all socialistic ideals but social security, Medicare, Medicare-for-all are all socialistic systems and many people like them. If we got rid of social security the poverty rate would almost quintuple to 44.4%. The minimum wage, maximum hour, and child labor laws are socialist programs because the government intervenes and steps in to require employers to follow those. Those standards might not be met  in an unregulated and truly free market. I don’t want all socialism I just want some programs that can improve people’s lives.

Would you talk to a nazi without mentioning deathcamps.  What if someone said, ''we have never seen a true nazi government,' like you said about socialism?   How would you feel about someone who said their version of naziism is better and more free than Hitler's version?  Only thing wrong with that analogy is that people who agree with you killed way more people than Hitler did.  Way way way more.   You don't get a pass for being a socialist any more  than a white power person gets a pass for believing the same things as slave owners.   You believe evil things and I'm going to call you on it.

Global warming is created by socialists as an attack on capitalism. Socialism is ON TOPIC like a mothafu...  It's icky and people who believe in it should be ashamed of themselves.  If you're a socialist, which I totally, correctly pegged you for (thank you thank you, tip the waitress) you should be ashamed of yourself.   You lose all cred because you believe awful awful awful things.   It is impossible to be a good person and be a socialist just like it's impossible to be a good person and be a white supremesist.   That's on topic in the global warming debate.  And if you don't like  my opinion about your soul then that's unfortunately you're problem, not mine.  There's no such thing as libertarian death camps and it helps me sleep at night.  Global Warming  is about awful American hating collectivists verses normal people.  But you're winning so be happy.

""This is the first time in the history of mankind that we are setting ourselves the task of intentionally, within a defined period of time, to change the economic development model that has been reigning for at least 150 years, since the Industrial Revolution,"" she said. Referring to a new international treaty environmentalists hope will at change conference later this year, she added: ""This is probably the most difficult task we have ever given ourselves, which is to intentionally transform the economic development model for the first time in human history.""



and



            IPCC official, Ottmar Edenhofer, speaking in November 2010: “But one must say clearly that we redistribute, de facto, the world's wealth by climate policy. … one has to free oneself from the illusion that international climate policy is environmental policy. Instead, climate change policy is about how we redistribute, de facto, the world’s wealth…” ""This has almost nothing to do with environmental policy, anymore.” 

From Der Spiegel



But unfortunately — as Michael Caine would say — “not many people know that”.  And so the climate circus rolls on.... 🌍🔥🤡🤪

You don't know how to make climate change sound more convincing? First start with facts and not emotions, don't alter data to suit your argument, alter your argument to suit the facts.
Don't be all in someones face shouting rhetoric, actually argue your case and be open to debate, even better with someone who knows their stuff and opposes your view, I mean that is in the best interest of the scientific method.

""No matter if the science of global warming is all phony...climate change provides the greatest opportunity to bring about justice and equality in the world."" - Christine Stewart, former Canadian Minister of the Environment 

The IPCC claims that they can predict the climate a hundred years into the future using computer models.
This is a scientifically proven impossible task.
Edward Lorenz meteorologist discovered chaos theory 1960's proved you can never predict complex systems accurately using a computer model.
The reasons why are well established science.
1. You can never know initial conditions accurately enough.
2. You can never know future influences.

Could I ask how you feel about us being 'deindustrialised' in the coming years with this climate fear, which is in fact a climate hoax.  There has always been climate change. The Greta phenomenon and XR, is a ruse to turn our lives into a dystopian world of austerity whereby we won't be able to afford to heat our homes. Roger Hallam, leader of XR wants to revert us back to the Stone Age!  It's all well and good doing away with fossil fuel but how will your everyday person be able to afford green energy. For example:  the European EV network which charges the public to recharge their batteries for their electric cars is increasing its charges  by 500%. You actually won't be able to afford to drive your electric car or move around.  No more holidays, no more travelling, no more using your gadgets, no more social media (take heed, you young ones!), no more clothing, I'm not sure how anything will be made, how we will we be fed, how will food be transported if all fossil fuels are disbanded?   Also, the key component in rechargeable batteries is lithium which is highly toxic to extract  from the ground as well as catastrophic to the environment.   It's called 'White Gold' and someone is making a lot of money - exactly the same people that are pushing the climate change agenda  There are billionaires out there that actually want to destroy our civilisation though you can be rest assured they will be living a very luxurious life at the expense of our impoverished one.   CO2 is not the enemy here, it is the stuff of life and part of photosynthesis.  There are many reasons that the climate changes and it always has done ever since the planet came into being.   I'm all for a cleaner planet, less plastic, lesss waste, better recycling facilities (as at present much of our waste is being either incinerated or sent off to a 3rd world country - why is that happening in this day and age and with our advanced technology?),  less polluted environments as well as cleaner air, to name just a few.  The mantra that we are in a Climate emergency is lies to scare everyone and most terribly scaring children - this is a form of child abuse.   

What do any of you know about the detrimental health effects of 5G which is being rolled out worldwide with devastating consequences. Many trees are having to be chopped down in order for 5G EMR to connect from one cell tower to the next (all within a 100m radius).  This does not bode well for our health for the future and will affect children primarily as they are smaller https://www.electricsense.com/5g-radiation-dangers/

I haven’t seen a single source or actual fact from you this entire time. So what about this. Debunk me with SCIENCE and good reliable sources and I’ll listen. I’m open minded and I love intellectual debates. So since you want it in my words and refuse to look my the links I shared. Climate change is any significant long-term change in the expected patterns of average weather of a region (or the whole Earth) over a significant period of time. Basically the difference in Earths global and/or regional climate over time. Climate change is about the abnormal variations to the climate, and the effects of these variations on other parts of the Earth. Again this can be measured. Natural causes (also measurable) alone cannot explain all of these changes. Meaning human activities are contributing to climate change, primarily by releasing billions of tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other heat-trapping gases (aka greenhouse gases). Greenhouse gases are accumulating in Earth's atmosphere and again as a result of human activities, causing surface air temperatures and subsurface ocean temperatures to rise. Again this can be measured. The current warming trend (from greenhouse gas emissions) is of particular significance because most of it is the result of human activity since the mid-20th century and proceeding at a rate that is unprecedented over decades to millennia. Satellites and other technologies have been used by scientists  to collect data and information regarding current and past climate. Evidence can also be found in tree rings, ocean sediments, coral reefs, and layers of sedimentary rocks. This evidence reveals that current warming is occurring roughly ten times faster than the average rate of ice-age-recovery warming. And according to data we should be in the ice-age-recovery warming but we’re not because humans. This will in result cause many problems on a global scale.

There are several “legitimate” resources out there.   Dane Winginton  Geoengineering Watch...or ask a fellow vet perhaps? 

... and because I’m a nice person and your a vet.. who has probably been heavily vaccinated.... go look up the documentary VAXXED.   But keep digging.... “Vaccine ingredients and Vaccine Secrets” The Health Wyze Report. 

Go research Dr. Otto Warburg... Joanne Budwig?  Did you know that there has been a cure for cancer since 1931? Dig deep ... did you know that Big Pharma funds the medical schools?  

Did you know that the FDA, which is a Government Agency gets 95% of its income from big Pharma? 

Do you know who owns and controls the Media? How many media companies are there? 

Do you know the danger of fluoride? 

Do you know that Bill Gates is wanted in India?  Do you know why?   

Do you know the danger of Electromagnetic waves?  Cell phones Towers?  Tablets? Cell phones?  Did you know there are protest all over about cell phone towers proximity neighborhoods, schools and playgrounds...but we don’t hear about it on the news.   

Did you know that people are complaining all over the world about the dangerous wind turbines?   How people and livestock are getting sick, dying, and there is an increase in reported birth defects caused by low frequency sound waves?   Allll over the world... why are we not hearing about it?

""Humans only contribute 15ppm on average."" - sources of the claim please. CO2 is the forcing, thawing of ground and ice sheets is just a positive feedback. What's driving the warming is the increase in CO2. Temperatures currently increase 20 times faster than ever before.

""what they reject is alarmism and assinine predictions"" - we can talk about effects later. What does your ""pales in comparison to the actual number of scientists"" say about global warming and its causes? Please provide a source. I'm not interested in your verbal diarrhea.

""yet another baseless claim, which you follow with a link to NASA (whom have contradicted some of their own scientists' work)"" - what is baseless about the list of organizations supporting AGW? Are you saying those are made up organizations? Do they not support AGW? So far the only thing that is baseless, is your claim of my list being baseless. Talk, talk. 

""and these scientists constantly arguing with eachother"" - these scientists are not arguing with each other about AGW. There were many reviews done on that, all came up with a 90-100% of them agreeing on AGW.

""I merely own and operate a logging business"" - so another uneducated bozo claiming he is smarter than all the thousands of climate experts put together.

""So you're trying to tell me scientists have this miraculous ability to trace where each carbon atom came from?"" - they get a very accurate estimate, because we can easily tell how much we emit CO2 from burning fossil fuels, and then measure concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere, land, and oceans.

I am an individualist, I hate the government, and I think supporting corporations is important because 90% of corporarions are small businesses and people working tirelessly to build up their own part of the world is incredible and needs to be supported.

All of that said, I believe in climate change and think something needs to be done about it. However, when folks left of center try to have this conversation - they often assume the only solution is through the government. This is dangerous and shuts down dialogue. Scientific consensus on the issue of climate change =/= consensus on policy prescription. I find a lot of the time that people left of center will call folks client change deniers when they do not believe a carbon tax will work, but do believe climate change is a problem that needs to be addressed now. This is harmful to the discussion from your side of the isle. When discussing ideological ""poisoning of the well"" - the left has a huge blind spot in the tactics that they use to do the same types of things they disdain in the right.

Personally, I think that technological innovation will bring us out of this. If enough businesses have the funds and resources for R&D, then they will have an economic incentive to develop something that tackles this issue. I think that slapping a carbon tax on the industry might delay the effects of climate change, but ultimately prohibit it from being resolved in a timely manner - which is what we all want, right? If we extend the duration of a solution, it might not come about in time. It's like placing a bandaid on a slit throat. We need to figure out a way to stitch the artery now - not waste time with the bandaid. Taking money out of the pockets of people who can actually develop that technology right now is a net negative, imo.

I think the left has a tendency to focus in on the bad apples in the group. The Bill and Melinda Gates foundation wouldn't exist with the policies y'all push. I also find that the policies don't accomplish the things you hope that they do. People on the left have this disdain for large corporations, but then place their hope in the largest, most corrupt monopolistic enterprise that has ever existed - the government. It makes no sense to me.

To clarify this point - people become cynical when you present a crisis and imply you know the solution's correct policy prescription when presenting scientific facts.

Does anyone in here know how accurate the climate models currently are ?


In the book ""A short story about nearly everything"" there was a short section on global warming, which said that it had been attempted to compare the climate models of that time with temperatures going back tensofthousands of years that they somehow measured from the ice... Anyway the conclusion was that the models were quite a long way from the historical data extracted from the ice and it was even indicated that we at that time were more or less fumbling in the dark.

It doesn't. It just tells us that the climbing temperatures will very likely be followed by a subsequent downturn at some point in the coming centuries or millennia.

Looking at its EM absorption and emission spectrums makes it pretty clear that increasing CO2 in an atmosphere under a sun should lead to a temperature increase.

That in turn should yield an increase in water in the air, which is even more of a green house gas. 

The water and CO2 increase *should* , in turn, yield more trees and other plant life which help lower the temperatures.

However we're clearing out the forests faster than they can recover so the number of trees is artificially being forced down as the heating contributors are going up.

Net result is a very fast temperature increase over a century that upsets the stability of established animal biomes, potentially leading to a starvation ripple through the food chain.

That's what we want to avoid and the most logical way is to slow down the temperature change which can be done by simply cutting our reliance on fossil fuels by hurting the profitability of it.

That's a word alt-leftists love to label people who don't happen to automatically believe in the climate- change -is- man- made cult.  To the people that love to push the climate change agenda onto others, what exactly do you folks want to see happen?  You are seen repeatedly demanding action on climate change, yet I don't recall you folks ever offering any solutions.  To achieve the so called 'zero emissions' by 2050 would call for a large escalation of government intrusion into peoples lives that will border on totalitarianism.  Leftists are mostly totalitarian anyway because they suppress free speech.  Tax would also be forced upon people.  As if the cost of living wasn't already high enough.    
I once went to a talk on climate change.  The guest speakers offered 'solutions' for ordinary people.  Their best advice?  1) Buy an electric car. 2) When on holiday overseas, use container ships as transport.  That's the best advice they gave.  Two problems with that.  Electric cars are still expensive.  Two, buy the time the container ship docked into the port destination, my holiday would already be over.  I was the only one who stood up and offered a suggestion, that was to eat a plant diet (Vegan if you prefer).  The esteemed guest speaker replied that 'we would have to be careful not to put our farmers out of work.'  The enchanted audience erupted in loud applause.  I kid you not.  Profits before planet and animal welfare.  By the way, if you push the climate change agenda onto others and you consume animal products such as meat and dairy, then you are among the biggest hypocrites on the planet.  
I feel so bad for Australia.  But their leftist media is pushing the climate change agenda whenever it has the opportunity because of the bush fires.  But, ABC news was caught deleting their Facebook posts encouraging climate change activists to campaign against controlled burning.  If controlled burning was allowed to happen, the bush fires wouldn't have been able to wreck as much devastation.  Nearly half a billion animals are believed to have died in agony in these bush fires.  Half a billion!  Also at least 20 people have died in these fires.  You alt-leftists, you climate change activists, must bear some of the blame for this tragedy.  
So don't put labels on me, when you folks have caused more carnage to the planet than I ever possibly could.  I don't even know why you idiots target normal people by blocking traffic and trains, when 70 percent of total man made emissions is caused by giant multinational corporations.  As for science?  I've read that ice core samples in Antarctica have revealed that thousands of years ago, the global temperature was two degrees higher than it currently is today. Climate change is natural and it has always been happening.  To blame it solely on mankind is short sighted and deceitful.  
Thanks to Greta's cringe worthy speech, I think the climate change movement has destroyed any credibility that it has managed to garner so far.  But in the end, leftism will always destroy itself.

If it's warmer, we'll have more plant growth.  It might help parts of the world in dealing with malnutrition.  If the U.S military took a fraction of it's obscene budget, it could easily end human starvation.  The ice core samples have revealed that in the past, the temperatures has been higher than it is today.  I have yet to hear the media mention the fluctuation of the suns activity.  The sun contains 99% of the mass in our solar system, so when it changes, we all change.  The agenda doesn't factor in the bias from temperature sensors that provide data for the weather either.  It is well known that urban areas trap more heat than temperatures in the countryside because man made structures form a heat sump.  So evenings in cities and towns are still radiating heat from the roads and buildings that is absorbed during the daytime.  Those temperature sensors are recording this.  Unfortunately, we will never really know the truth, as the climate change agenda makes a lot of money for a lot of businesses and they therefore have a motive to go on perpetuating this belief.  
I can't take climate protesters seriously.  I know for a fact that once they have waved their banners and signs at protest marches, many of them will stop by fast food restaurants for a beef burger, each patting themselves on the back for the feel good work they've done.  Unfortunately, with each bite they take, they are supporting livestock farming and deforestation.  As if contributing to the half a billion animals being burnt alive in the Australian bushfires wasn't enough.  Opps!
The climate change cult has also taken over the schools.  Children are coming home terrified that the world is going to end.  When I see the climate change agenda being pushed, I think of brain washing.  Strange, isn't it, how Al Gore's predictions haven't come true.  Strange, isn't it, that if the sea levels were rising, why does insurance companies and government still allow large construction projects of multi million dollar buildings to take place right beside the shore line?

People fight against the science of climate change (which I fully accept) for many reasons: disbelief, fear, the fact that political partisans use the scientific reality to push their favourite policies etc etc etc. 


The first step to convincing climate skeptics is to treat them as logical people that have a different weighing of the metrics to ourselves and calmly try to explain why they might want to re-think. Moralising, screeching and denigrating these people isn't the way forward in my opinion.


As scientists, we also need to keep the discussion on the science and stop suggesting that the science is automatically policy prescriptive. It is not and that is not science. The IPCC are very clear on this point and in their reports.

A few months ago a large group of youtubers started a charity campaign to plant trees called #TeamTrees, citing climate change as a justification for doing so.


But you're right, we _should_ plant more trees. Furthermore, your observation is extremely useful, because it shows one of the many ways in which the solutions for climate change are presented that are extremely political.
Your suggestion to plant more trees is something we as individuals can do, by planting a tree in our backyards or local parks, and something we can get major companies to do, as it can be used for marketing purposes (such as in here in Norway).

But you ask why we aren't worried about other problems? Well, it's because those problems are in fact lesser problems.
Trash is ruining the ocean, but increased CO2 is increasing acidity, which eats up coral reefs much faster than plastic wrap kills fish.
Biodiversity is important, and yet the reservations we have made are eroding away as we have less and less farmable land, which we then take from reservations.
In both your examples, and many more, climate change is a greater threat than most other human activities. The thing we as a species are doing which has the biggest impact on the environment appears to be burning fossil fuels, as evidenced by the unusually sharp upturn in average global temperatures. If this is just weather, then it is weather so extreme that we have never experienced it in the entire history of our species.

THESE ARE THE FACTS... 
The world population is increasing. We need more food! How to grow more food? (1) A warmer climate. (2) More food for the plants i.e CO2 in the air. Luckily we have seen improvements already.  We have slowly gotten out of the Little Ice Age during the last 1-200 years with the planet warming up again, and with higher levels of CO2 we have seen a greening of the planet the last decades, which has resulted in a huge increase in global food production. 

The data: https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/carbon-dioxide-fertilization-greening-earth? 

The data shows that global warming is having a dramatic positive effect on crop yields. As an example, the average corn yields (measured in tons per hectare) in the USA since 1940, have INCREASED MORE THAN FIVE-FOLD! We see more or less the same trends in Europe and the rest of the world for most of the major food crops. Access to cheap fossil fuel has allowed us to grow food ever more efficient, and against all odds, we are now able to feed the growing world population. Famine is now half of what it was 30 years ago. Only populations without access to fossil fuel are starving today! 

The data: https://ourworldindata.org/yields-and-land-use-in-agriculture

There is a lot more food and wealth per capita now than it used to be, thanks to cheap fossil fuel. And because of this and unprecedented access to cheap fossil fuel during the last 100 years, we are now better off, when it comes to the economy, health, education, technology, social equality, war/peace, etc than any time in our known history. We are in a time with more resources and human well-being than ever before. 

AND IT'S GETTING BETTER EVERY YEAR! :) 

A hundred years ago you were more educated than most if you could read, and wealthier than most if you owned shoes. And you had to work 12+ hours every day just to put food on the table. We should be thankful for living in this time and not in the ages before us. The generations living today are more privileged than any generation before us, thanks to cheap fossil fuel.

The truth of the above has absolutely no bearing on whether or not fossil fuel induced climate change is bad. Consider if I gave you a magic wand, which can serve your every need. Fifty years down the line, you get cancer from the wand. Even though the wand did a lot of good things, that doesn't mean everything it ever does is good. Same for fossil fuels.


The things fossil fuels provide for us *can be replaced.* We can get energy from other sources. For instance, solar energy now is cheaper and more efficient than fossil fuels 200 years ago. Furthermore, I have yet to meet a single person that thinks we should go back to the stone age, for any reason, including climate change.

My good sir, that which is asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence. You have not proven anything, and I spent some words explaining exactly why it's false. To repeat myself:
_Clouds can, according to the studies done by NASA, linger longer when subsonic airplanes fly through them. This is not geoengineering._

As it stands, the NASA source describes testing of cloud formation after airplanes pass through the sky. It does not describe testing on aerosol injection, but they do describe testing done when aerosols have been naturally injected, i.e. volcanoes. As such, the source you site does not describe geoengineering, and I challenge you to quote or direct me to where in the source your provided they say that they have attempted any form of geoengineering.
What NASA have done is studied how clouds form. That is all your source demonstrates.

How does that test work? Where is my appeal to authority? I suggest that your reasoning is invalid. There is no authority I am appealing to, the closest I come is by describing what the NASA source says. A source you provided to support your beliefs. How am I applying an appeal to authority? And where do I do it?
Yes, Google has recently come out stating that they will work harder to limit the influence of unfounded conspiracy theories such as cold fusion, flat earthers and 9/11-truthers. The fact that your beliefs are in very bad company does not suggest that they are true. Nor does the fact that your beliefs are being censored mean that they are true. It could be, shockingly, that everything you believe is being hidden from you is not true. In such a case, your beliefs would also be suppressed, as other such beliefs are.

Most importantly, the .gov source does not support your claims. At all. You claimed I would have to deny that .gov sites talk about geoengineering, and yet *you did not provide a .gov site which talks about geoengineering.* The closest link I can come up with is that you are suggesting that doing experiments on how water vapour forms is the same as geoengineering. This is patently untrue, but perhaps I have misunderstood what you meant.


Now, the video... I strongly suspect this was an April fools joke. Since neither the youtube video nor the news broadcaster within it contain any actual sources, I think this is a reasonable conclusion.
You see, electrolysis is not a newly patented method of extracting energy from water. What it does is separate the hydrogen from the oxygen, which can then be burned as fuel. The problem is that electrolysis requires at least as much energy as burning the resulting hydrogen gives, thanks to those pesky laws of thermodynamics.
But by far the biggest hint that this was a joke of deception is that they describe this new fuel as HHO. I.e. Hydrogen, hydrogen, oxygen. Aka H2O, aka water. The thing that is being said (by your source!) is that he turns water into water by electrolysis, which somehow gives free energy, rather than costing energy.


It is not reasonable to expect me to believe in infinite free energy just because you say so. Which brings us neatly to the next topic: your claims.
You have done nothing to suggest cold fusion is valid. Yes, the research into cold fusion is older than I am. So is the research into the Aether in space, and into the orbits of planets in a geocentric system. Just because something is old doesn't mean it's true.
You do suggest that cloud seeding could be a thing, albeit as a misnomer. Clouds can, according to the studies done by NASA, linger longer when subsonic airplanes fly through them. This is not geoengineering.

1) Don't say ""the science is settled"", science is about constantly challenging assumptions and re-testing hypotheses when new information becomes available. We have been studying the human body for 100's of years and are still unsure whether saturated fat is good or bad for you, the climate involves infinitely more complex systems and integration of different scientific disciplines yet you think this particular area has been ""settled""?? We're still arguing about the number of planets in our solar system, the number of elements on the periodic table... The politicians and news people are the ones who say the science is settled, the Bill Nyes of this world, not the scientists themselves.
2) Don't say ""99% of scientists agree!"" - those studies have been proven massively inaccurate with scientists actually voicing that their studies had been misrepresented. The authors often mis-allocated studies which merely talked about the consequences of climate change IF it happened as studies which PROVED climate change was real - yet studies of this caliber pass peer review? 
3) Speaking of sea-levels, don't say X million people will be living under sea-level, especially without knowing that X million people already live below sea-level... and definitely don't say ""but the sea-levels will rise by X meters"" because that's wrong - nearly the entire mass of an the earth's ice is below sea-level already so it wont have any effect, and any amount that is above sea-level will be almost exactly equal to the decrease in volume which occurs when ice turns to water.

""No snow"" isn;t a prediction of global warming. Many places will see more snow. For example, Lake Erie isn't freezing over as much in winter anymore, but we still get below freezing temps, and open water evaporates more water into the clouds than a sheet of ice does, so that will often generate worse snowstorms. 2 degrees F warming doesn't cancel winter .


As for ice melt, that's one area where the actual outcomes have been markedly WORSE than the predictions.

You keep looking in the news, and I will keep looking in the news. Here are my predictions, and you can write me back if I'm wrong and tell me how wrong I was:


If we keep burning fossil fuels, the Earth will keep warming and the warming will continue to reflect the accurate climate models that are built upon the link between massive CO2 and methane emissions and global warming:


https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-how-well-have-climate-models-projected-global-warming


Global ice will keep melting at record/ rates, as will permafrost. The loss of annual meltwater in Asia will start causing massive agricultural, social, and political problems. 


Sea level rise will continue to be very gradual, albeit slowly accelerating. The Maldives is losing its beaches and Boston is getting more nuisance flooding, but I think the bigger stories regarding routine flooding will slowly ramp up in intensity. 


Meanwhile, more intense droughts, wildfires, storms, and floods are already here, and will continue causing many billions to hundreds of billions of dollars in damage. 


In thirty years, we'll think the one million Syrian refugees looks like a walk in the park as we struggle to deal with tens of millions of climate refugees. 


Warming plus more CO2 will cause some of the most devastating effects in the oceans, not just killing off species, but slowing ocean currents (already happening) and thus disrupting weather patterns. 


Between pollution, plastics, and warming, we will see the continued unraveling of the web of life, from plankton and insects up through the food chain (birds, amphibians, mammals), and we will start getting really scared in a few decades as farmers start having a harder time growing crops they used to grow easily (the pest infestations spread by warming plus the need of crops for more water with higher CO2 levels plus worse droughts are a triple-header threat here). 


Once-rare diseases will spread in frequency and geographic range. 
 
But if I'M right, and you see these things happening, I hope and pray you'll pitch in to solve them. The clock really is ticking.

""The only problem is the actual sensitivity is somewhere between tiny and non-existent."" Actually, you've lost the debate: The models are quite accurate, they've figured out the sensitivity, and ALL net warming over the last 150 years was caused by us. We should have been cooling recently. Just watch the short video or scroll through the charts of the climate models vs observed GLOBAL temps:


https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-how-well-have-climate-models-projected-global-warming


Even Hansen's 1981 model was quite accurate. And as for it all being caused by us, to dip your toes into the evidence, try all three levels of content in the link below, but especially see Figures 4b, c, and d in the “Advanced” level:

Finally, it’s the SPEED of temperature and CO2 changes which is so lethal to the web of life—TEN TIMES faster than when coming out of an ice age. Most life can’t adapt to the rapid and cascading changes that brings, and our civilization is totally unprepared for the tsunami of rapid and harmful changes coming our way in the next century (but already beginning now). 

If we stay on the path we are on, that leads towards mass die-offs and extinctions of most human and planetary life. I’m almost 60, have two young adult kids, generally care about people and nature, and wish we didn’t do this, but we did. 

Happily, there are hundreds of strategies for healing and restoring a healthy balance, but we will need to switch to lifestyles and an economic model that actually obey the limits and laws of nature. That includes a RAPID transition away from burning fossil fuels and simpler lifestyles in wealthy nations (especially for the rich folks whose lifestyles cause by far the most damage).

""I've read it all before."" With all due respect, no you haven't, and you know you haven't.


""There are massive holes in ""the science"". No there aren't: In terms of climate science, the evidence that strong is like investigating a murder scene and knowing the suspect had motive, opportunity, all other potential suspects have a clear alibi and have been systematically ruled out, you know the means of death, the suspect’s fingerprints are on the murder weapon and you have a videotape of him committing the crime. 


And the fact that the models have been so accurate in predicting warming based on the amount of CO2 added demonstrates that the scientists have this figured out:


The predictions from climate scientists from the 1980s and beyond, including those from the IPCC have  quite accurate, while the predictions of climate deniers like Lindzen were way off the mark. For example, 

* In 1982, Exxon scientists accurately predicted global warming
https://skepticalscience.com/1982-exxon-accurate-prediction.html

* Various climate models have been quite accurate, especially when you factor in that they couldn't have predicted the 2008 global recession that slowed the world's economy and caused a dip in CO2 emissions.

""First it was global cooling, then warming, then climate change, then the oceans ate my warming. The science is nothing other than a drama."" Many people believe that because they have been exposed to the media not the science. There never was a time when most scientists said we were headed for global cooling. A few scientists hypothesized about that and the media made a big deal and sold lots of magazines hyping that idea, but the VAST MAJORITY of scientific articles on the subject in the 1970s said we were heading for global warming due to our burning of fossil fuels. 


https://skepticalscience.com/What-1970s-science-said-about-global-cooling.html


If you know the history of the issue, there is one legitimate and one propaganda reason for switching the terminology from ""global warming"" to ""climate change."" Scientists wanted to convey that the warming had broader effects for climate, so they favored the switch, and being pretty clueless about the science of persuasion, didn't realize that the phrase ""climate change"" would work against people taking the issue more seriously than they were. Meanwhile, GOP framing expert Frank Luntz  (the guy behind ""death panels, job-killing regulations, etc."") proposed the GOP switch to using climate change because it sounded more generic and harmless ""Hey, the climate is always changing."" He has later admitted he believes AGW is real and a serious issue and he regrets being part of this, but framing it that way allows people to miss what is really happening. For those reasons, I prefer ""man-made global warming and climate disruption.""


I know what you mean about the oceans eating your warming, but the oceans are part of the Earth, we know they will absorb most of the excess heat and much of the excess CO2 we produce, but despite a very short plateau around 2005-2010 (other factors that affect temps can offset annual warming from CO2 for a couple of years), the overall global warming trend looks like a mountain slope--and even faster warming since 2010 offset the ""pause"" in warming from 2005-2010 (the things that created that ""pause"" were just temporary fluctuations anyways).   


Once they got the climate sensitivity worked out in the early 1980s, the climate models have been quite accurate in predicting how much warming will occur based on how much CO2 we add.

""Even if the globe had warmed at all it would be a good thing."" 
I live in a colder climate and love summer, so it's easy for my mind to think that warmer weather would be better.. because I would enjoy it personally. I took a walk yesterday on a 57 degree day in Northeast Ohio on December 9th. Very pleasant for ME at that moment. And I think the odds are good you consume other sources of information that tell you a warmer planet would be a good thing and that ""CO2 is plant food.""


Unfortunately, the reality is far more complicated than that. All life on Earth has been adapted to cooler global temps for thousands of years and much lower CO2 levels for the last 800,000 years, and life does best when the conditions it evolved it stay in place, or if they do change, they change VERY slowly. 


Life IS adaptable, but it can only adapt so fast, and we are warming the planet 10-20 times faster than when coming out of an ice age, and we have increased the acidity of the oceans by 30% in the blink of an eye in terms of geological time. 


So what has happened five times before on Earth when there were very rapid changes in temperatures, CO2 levels, or other living conditions? Mass extinctions of life. The last time the planet warmed this rapidly (and oceans absorbed lots more CO2),  over 90% of life in the oceans went extinct, as did over 70% of life on land, including everything over 90 pounds. 


Rapid warming (and increased CO2) set in motion hundreds of ripple effects that upset the delicate equilibrium of life, leading to mass die-offs of species. Air that is 1 degree C warming can hold 7% more moisture, so the atmosphere sucks up moisture from some places (like the American west) more than before and dumps it elsewhere, creating worsening droughts, wildfires, storms (more CAT 5 hurricanes), and floods (several ""once in every 500-year floods"" just in the last 5 years""). With drier soil, the trees in the Rockies got stressed and less able to fight disease and insects, and warmer temps allowed the spread of two species of bark beetles that feed on trees. So all of a sudden, you have more than 800 million ""standing dead"" trees in Colorado alone:


https://www.denverpost.com/2017/02/15/dead-trees-colorado-forests/


Sure, more CO2 creates more greening in some places, but guess what the ""CO2 is plant food"" folks like Matt Ridley didn't tell you?  Crops grow thicker leaves, so they require more water, at even at 1 degree of warming, staple crops have lost 5-8% of several key nutrients. And guess what happens when people eat less nutrient-dense foods? More obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and more and more of our personal and national budgets get drained to fix sick bodies instead of just for living. 


As temps have warmed, the corn belt has moved over 100 miles northward in the US and the boundary between the warm dry west and cool moist east has moved 140 miles eastward. As these boundaries shift, areas that have been the bread basket of the US and the world will become less and less able to provide the crops they used to provide. Scientists estimate that 60% of the world's wheat crop will be in trouble by 2100, and because the changes we have set in motion are non-linear changes (our rate of greenhouse gas emissions has been doubling every 25 years), that's probably a conservative estimate). 


https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/09/26/new-research-warns-severe-climate-related-droughts-could-threaten-60-global-wheat


Meanwhile, the warming and acidification of the oceans has slowed ocean currents, has already reduced slightly the amount of oxygen in the water, and has caused mass die-offs of coral reefs, the rainforests of the oceans: 


https://www.cbsnews.com/news/great-barrier-reef-australia-downgrades-outlook-coral-very-poor-ocean-warming-today-2019-08-30/


https://weather.com/science/environment/news/2019-07-31-guam-coral-reefs-bleaching


As the reefs go, many fish species that depend on the reefs will reduce in numbers or even go extinct, and on the path we are on, virtually all coral reefs are expected to be dead by 2100. A recent study showed that in the last 2 decades, New England lost 16% of its fishing jobs due to global warming and climate disruption:


https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/12/191209161317.htm


That trend will continue if we keep destroying the marine ecosystems, and on the other end of the spectrum, ski season is getting shorter and shorter, reducing income and jobs. Around here, ski season should have started two weeks ago, but there's no weather in sight cold enough for them to make snow and keep it on the slopes. All the while, we'll be paying more and more out of pocket to fix the damage from worsening droughts, floods, and wildfires. 


I'm guessing you're used to climate debates where one side says it's all a leftist tax scam and CO2 is plant food (but those folks don't know the research) and the other side says the science is clear and the deniers are anti-science idiots (but most of those folks don't know the research either, so their faith in the scientists sounds more like a religion). That's not a very productive discussion. I'm a university researcher who for more than a decade has been researching and writing a book about why the health of society and the planet are unraveling, and what we need to do to heal them. I've read thousands of sources, discussed and debated with thousands of people (helpful for finding out what you don't know), and I'm sorry to report that the threats from global warming and climate disruption are real, man-made, lethal, and urgent. But they are not urgent in the sense of a lion running at you or a hurricane that will make landfall tomorrow, so the human brain struggles to grasp them. Life on Earth WON'T end in 2030 if we don't cut greenhouse gas emissions 50% by then, but  the real problem is that our actions today (me driving and heating my house with fossil fuels) is setting in motion chain reactions that unfolds over decades, centuries, and even millennia. And if we don't stop global warming soon (and reverse it), we will pass certain tipping points where we get runaway warming and ice melt and climate disruption. If that happens, we may be powerless to stop the changes until the Earth gets 5-8 degrees C warmer (9-14 degrees F). If that happens, much of the Earth will become unlivable, uninhabitable, and long before we get there, we'll be looking at hundreds of millions of climate refugees that will overwhelm nations' ability to cope (that big Syrian refugee crisis was only 1 million people). 


So, that's just a tiny fraction of the big-picture devastation that we are heading for if we keep burning fossil fuels and warming the planet (while also polluting it and destroying wilderness habitat): Gradual and sometimes sudden collapse of the ecosystems that human life depends on, resulting in the degradation then collapse of civilizations, and hundreds of millions to billions of human deaths. We recklessly overspent our Earth budget, and forgot that our lives depend on the health of  the Earth's ecosystems. We upset the apple cart, so now we are literally in a race for the long-term survival of human civilization.

“Even the rather primitive climate computer models of the 1970s, 80s and 90s were impressively accurate, lending extra credibility to the much more advanced climate models of today. That's the conclusion of a paper released Wednesday in Geophysical Research Letters, a peer-reviewed science journal.”
“Using this criteria, the models performed even better – 14 of the 17 model projections were consistent with observed real-world surface temperatures.” (That is, when you plugged in the amount of greenhouse gases that WERE actually produced, not what they guessed would be produced)

The reason we are in this mess is because of the innovation, greed and individualistic worldview of the modern world. We say we can just fix it with more innovation and tech but that's what got us here in the first place, this is the classic fighting fire with fire. With new tech and innovation brings further uncertainty of the negative impacts that every new technology may bring. No tech is simply bad or good all tech is good and bad. We exploit land and its resources, man isnt above nature, we act as if we can tame mother nature. Who cares about others and the future just worry about making money for your own company or yourself. Completely unregulated free markets (they practically dont exist) which is central to capitalism. Every political system is on the spectrum of pure capitalism and pure communism at which both extremes will ultimately lead to self destruction. And I think this is what people must realize. There is a balance of socialism and capitalism that we must find in order to incentivising enough production to support the needs of everyone while having a reasonable amount of redistribution of wealth and regulations. Capitalism produces too much that ultimately incentivising self gain and explotation at the cost to everyone else including future generations. Simply put capitalism with no regulations and taxes is unsustainable. Communism produces too little which historically and currently starve many people to death. We are currently too hyper consumerist and we waste too much. The only way we solve our issue is completely shifting our worldview. We cant see ourselves as above nature in some hierarchy cuz in reality we arent. We say we are destroying the world but that's mainly because we are destroying what makes earth inhabitable for us. Earth will eventually rebalance itself out in the long run as many of the deniers have pointed out there are cyclical warming and cold periods.

This is about the long-term survival and thriving of human civilization. The research is very clear on that. Man-made global warming and climate disruption is already eating into your freedoms and mine by ramping up costs for dealing with epic droughts, wildfires, storms, and floods, and by killing jobs.

I fact google has switched to only clean energy already, yet people are acting like the fire is getting worse. If they scare people this much and act like the effects are he getting worse and worse, even though so many people have done so much against it, don’t you question if climate change is really that bad?

Switching to Stone Age isn’t an option, Fossil fuel is used by too many people. Protesting doesn’t seem to help either.

Speaking as a researcher who is working on a book that is partly about global warming, we know that the climate emergency is real, lethal, urgent, and WE caused it. How do we know human activity is the main cause of almost all recent global warming? If the theory of man-made global warming is true, science should be able to verify that several things happen: 

1) Burning fossil fuels should increase the levels of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide) in the atmosphere and oceans. 
2) If the additional CO2 in the atmosphere was mostly due to human activity, the relative proportion of carbon 12/carbon 13 isotopes in the atmosphere should gradually shift towards the ratio produced by burning fossil fuels (2% more Carbon 12). 
3) After human activity has markedly increased levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases, the lower atmosphere and the oceans should get warmer than before. 
4) After human activity has markedly increased levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases, the upper atmosphere should get cooler. 
5) After human activity has markedly increased levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases, there should be an increase in the lower atmosphere of the specific wavelengths of thermal energy that specific greenhouses gases (CO2, methane, nitrous oxide) absorb and re-radiate. 
6) After human activity has markedly increased levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases, there should be a decrease in the upper atmosphere of the specific wavelengths of thermal energy that specific greenhouses gases (CO2, methane, nitrous oxide) absorb and re-radiate. 
7) Models of the relationship between levels of greenhouse gases and average global temperatures should predict global warming with reasonable accuracy. 
8) Research that takes into consideration the effects of multiple natural factors (sun’s activity, earth’s orbit, etc.) and anthropogenic (man-made) factors on global temperatures should find that the addition of greenhouse gases due to burning fossil fuels contributed to a substantial degree to the amount of warming that has been observed. 

ALL EIGHT of those predictions of climate science (plus others) have been confirmed by research. For #7, while some early models overestimated the impact of more CO2, after they made that adjustment to the models, numerous models have been quite accurate, including models from the early 1980s. Thus, the fingerprints of global warming caused by us burning fossil fuels are all over the thermal content and the CO2 volume and the CO2 composition of the lower and upper atmosphere. Therefore, we have incredibly solid proof that recent warming was caused by us burning fossil fuels.

Finally, it’s the SPEED of temperature and CO2 changes which is so lethal to the web of life—TEN TIMES faster than when coming out of an ice age. Most life can’t adapt to the rapid and cascading changes that brings, and our civilization is totally unprepared for the tsunami of rapid and harmful changes coming our way in the next century (but already beginning now). 

If we stay on the path we are on, that leads towards mass die-offs and extinctions of most human and planetary life. I’m almost 60, have two young adult kids, generally care about people and nature, and wish we didn’t do this, but we did. 

Happily, there are hundreds of strategies for healing and restoring a healthy balance, but we will need to switch to lifestyles and an economic model that actually obey the limits and laws of nature. That includes a RAPID transition away from burning fossil fuels and simpler lifestyles in wealthy nations (especially for the rich folks whose lifestyles cause by far the most damage).

Particularly, if we had a longer temperature record and measured on todays standards, as well as a longer co2 record to confirm the correlation with more certainty.  But when the official temp record began, it only covered 20% of the globe and mostly in the northern hemi. In modern times 80% of the globe is covered and they are working on further improvement. So, for much of the accepted record that shows warming, much of the globe wasn't even covered. You don't have to be an expert scientist to have reasonable doubts about the temperature record. And it would be nice if they had started measuring co2 a long time before the official temp record, so we could see a clear and long official measured co2 behaviour pre-industrialisation and the human factor at play at the point of industrialisation. But unfortunately, because of alarmism, people aren't willing to wait for real data that won't be avaliable for decades, or even centuries to come.  With a branch of science (climate science) that can't even do a controlled experiment to back up its primary claim i.e. that anthropogenic co2 causes the warming,  they shouldn't be making the claims of certainty and alarmism they do without the hard data at hand. That doesn't mean we shouldn't  do things to reduce pollution,  do scientific research and innovation for alternative energy sources,, and protect natural sinks, clean up the ocean etc, but it does mean we should not be rushing the west into urgent social and economic structural change and that we should be recognising a developing nations right to use its natural resources in a way to develop on similar terms to us.

Actually, the $200 million a year propaganda campaign has been focused on making people doubt man0made global warming. Speaking as a researcher who is working on a book that is partly about global warming, we know that the climate emergency is real, lethal, urgent, and WE caused it. How do we know human activity is the main cause of almost all recent global warming? If the theory of man-made global warming is true, science should be able to verify that several things happen: 

1) Burning fossil fuels should increase the levels of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide) in the atmosphere and oceans. 
2) If the additional CO2 in the atmosphere was mostly due to human activity, the relative proportion of carbon 12/carbon 13 isotopes in the atmosphere should gradually shift towards the ratio produced by burning fossil fuels (2% more Carbon 12). 
3) After human activity has markedly increased levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases, the lower atmosphere and the oceans should get warmer than before. 
4) After human activity has markedly increased levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases, the upper atmosphere should get cooler. 
5) After human activity has markedly increased levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases, there should be an increase in the lower atmosphere of the specific wavelengths of thermal energy that specific greenhouses gases (CO2, methane, nitrous oxide) absorb and re-radiate. 
6) After human activity has markedly increased levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases, there should be a decrease in the upper atmosphere of the specific wavelengths of thermal energy that specific greenhouses gases (CO2, methane, nitrous oxide) absorb and re-radiate. 
7) Models of the relationship between levels of greenhouse gases and average global temperatures should predict global warming with reasonable accuracy. 
8) Research that takes into consideration the effects of multiple natural factors (sun’s activity, earth’s orbit, etc.) and anthropogenic (man-made) factors on global temperatures should find that the addition of greenhouse gases due to burning fossil fuels contributed to a substantial degree to the amount of warming that has been observed. 

ALL EIGHT of those predictions of climate science (plus others) have been confirmed by research. For #7, while some early models overestimated the impact of more CO2, after they made that adjustment to the models, numerous models have been quite accurate, including models from the early 1980s. Thus, the fingerprints of global warming caused by us burning fossil fuels are all over the thermal content and the CO2 volume and the CO2 composition of the lower and upper atmosphere. Therefore, we have incredibly solid proof that recent warming was caused by us burning fossil fuels.

Finally, it’s the SPEED of temperature and CO2 changes which is so lethal to the web of life—TEN TIMES faster than when coming out of an ice age. Most life can’t adapt to the rapid and cascading changes that brings, and our civilization is totally unprepared for the tsunami of rapid and harmful changes coming our way in the next century (but already beginning now). 

If we stay on the path we are on, that leads towards mass die-offs and extinctions of most human and planetary life. I’m almost 60, have two young adult kids, generally care about people and nature, and wish we didn’t do this, but we did. 

Happily, there are hundreds of strategies for healing and restoring a healthy balance, but we will need to switch to lifestyles and an economic model that actually obey the limits and laws of nature. That includes a RAPID transition away from burning fossil fuels and simpler lifestyles in wealthy nations (especially for the rich folks whose lifestyles cause by far the most damage).

822,Ugys6GC6LYP3eNMHV7d4AaABAg,0.0,1.0,2019-12-09T02:46:39Z,Karl Wheatley,"""There is zero science behind this ridiculous story of man made climate change."" With all due respect, it sounds like you don't know anything about climate science. There are thousands of research studies that have gone into the overwhelming majority of climate scientists concluding that human activity is the cause of recent global warming.  Speaking as a researcher who is working on a book that is partly about global warming, we know that the climate emergency is real, lethal, urgent, and WE caused it. How do we know human activity is the main cause of almost all recent global warming? IF the theory of man-made global warming is true, science should be able to verify that several things happen: 

1) Burning fossil fuels should increase the levels of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide) in the atmosphere and oceans. 
2) If the additional CO2 in the atmosphere was mostly due to human activity, the relative proportion of carbon 12/carbon 13 isotopes in the atmosphere should gradually shift towards the ratio produced by burning fossil fuels (2% more Carbon 12). 
3) After human activity has markedly increased levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases, the lower atmosphere and the oceans should get warmer than before. 
4) After human activity has markedly increased levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases, the upper atmosphere should get cooler. 
5) After human activity has markedly increased levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases, there should be an increase in the lower atmosphere of the specific wavelengths of thermal energy that specific greenhouses gases (CO2, methane, nitrous oxide) absorb and re-radiate. 
6) After human activity has markedly increased levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases, there should be a decrease in the upper atmosphere of the specific wavelengths of thermal energy that specific greenhouses gases (CO2, methane, nitrous oxide) absorb and re-radiate. 
7) Models of the relationship between levels of greenhouse gases and average global temperatures should predict global warming with reasonable accuracy. 
8) Research that takes into consideration the effects of multiple natural factors (sun’s activity, earth’s orbit, etc.) and anthropogenic (man-made) factors on global temperatures should find that the addition of greenhouse gases due to burning fossil fuels contributed to a substantial degree to the amount of warming that has been observed. 

ALL EIGHT of those predictions of climate science (plus others) have been confirmed by research. For #7, while some early models overestimated the impact of more CO2, after they made that adjustment to the models, numerous models have been quite accurate, including models from the early 1980s. Thus, the fingerprints of global warming caused by us burning fossil fuels are all over the thermal content and the CO2 volume and the CO2 composition of the lower and upper atmosphere. Therefore, we have incredibly solid proof that recent warming was caused by us burning fossil fuels.


To dip your toes into the evidence, try all three levels of content in the link below, but especially see Figures 4b, c, and d in the “Advanced” level:

Finally, it’s the SPEED of temperature and CO2 changes which is so lethal to the web of life—TEN TIMES faster than when coming out of an ice age. Most life can’t adapt to the rapid and cascading changes that brings, and our civilization is totally unprepared for the tsunami of rapid and harmful changes coming our way in the next century (but already beginning now). 

If we stay on the path we are on, that leads towards mass die-offs and extinctions of most human and planetary life. I’m almost 60, have two young adult kids, generally care about people and nature, and wish we didn’t do this, but we did. 

Happily, there are hundreds of strategies for healing and restoring a healthy balance, but we will need to switch to lifestyles and an economic model that actually obey the limits and laws of nature. That includes a RAPID transition away from burning fossil fuels and simpler lifestyles in wealthy nations (especially for the rich folks whose lifestyles cause by far the most damage).

The premise of the eco-doom rests on us ignorant, petty bourgeoisie that keeps indulging in an ""ecological ""Krystallnacht"" (to borrow some of Al Gore's blather) in our mindless consumerism, constituting an ""unprecedented danger"" to our precious and fragile Earth, necessitating the ascendancy of ""heroic"" politicians to office in order to preach the gospel of over-population (wonder what kind of things they'll do when it comes to actually disposing of people - but then again, Nazis and Commies have quite a repertoire of possible methods of rectifying the ""problem"", even if ""Planned Parenthood"" isn't enough) to us and then, ""rescue"" us through increased government regulation and taxes. Nevermind scientific progress - never mind the scientific method. Political/scientific consensus has it - enough ""ayes"" and, thus, eco-doom is certain. The newest generation doesn't remember the prior types of similar bullcrap pushed first by Gunther Schwab (a Nazi poet who believed that the ""suburban"" life will destroy the ""wilderness and countryside"" and, of course, being the true Nazi scum he is, lived to 86 years old and founded the ""World Union for Protection of Life"" (just not human life, apparently - we have an ""overpopulation"" problem, you see), then by Paul Ehrlich (""Population Bomb"" - which failed to explode, with Julian Simon making a wager with Ehrlich. And, guess what - Ehrlich lost) and, then, by Al Gore (ah, ""An Inconvenient Truth"" - more like a convenient lie, since neither Gore nor other oligarchs stopped jetting around the world in fuel guzzlers. That's the thing when it comes to Marxists of all kinds - poverty and equality in poverty are for other people to be). As for ""science""... There ain't no such thing as a ""greenhouse gas"" because Earth isn't a glass dome - heat still comes and goes through space. The most significant factor in weather is cloud cover, anyway. So...

He showed a lot of data, and my parents aren’t climate change deniers per say, but they also don’t feel strongly that we need to do anything to protect the earth so they didn’t set me straight. The lecturer also taught about a 6000 year old earth and stuff like that. I firmly believed everything he said until I got to college. By then, I was starting to doubt some of what he said and was ready to hear about what other people’s opinions of these things was. Luckily, I had a few professors who set me straight, and I got to do some projects for different classes that forced me to do research.

I can rebut every single solution they present in the topic of any issue (""what the myth says""  vs ""what science says"")

The oil industry fairy tail is your base of all this? You do not realize that this indeed is a conspiracy theory. The only true core in this is that the oil industries analyses CO2 to find oilfields, therefore they accelerated the understanding of CO2, which led to the Kieling curve.  The oil industries does not give a damn, they will know how to sell oil especialy when there is an artifical shortage, they know that fuel is necessary for many decades to come. Cheap gas just lead to a huge reduction in cole and oil usage in the USA, this is how reality changes, not with a bond villian B movie corprate dystopia. The magnitude of effort to fool the whole world and pull the global strings, THAT is real flatearther niveau.

So what questions WOULD YOU ask? To skip this part makes everything else irelevant.

Why don`t you ask some questions to yourself? It is not fair to assume that the others are crazy and from there on treating them with psychological tricks. There is a huge arrogance masked behind your actual happy and sympathic apearance.

-Why are even the decades of 1900 - 1940 compareable to 1980 -  20019 ,  before the main emissions?
-Why are there countless debates on ""saturation"" aka opacity?
-Talking about psychology: Ever heard of the Milgram experiment and the eugenics?
-The argument that ""it is their life"" also and even more so fits for scientists that would have to realize that their conclusions were wrong their whole career and life.

The global climate is changing, but the actual question of whether or not man's industrial and fossil fuel burning activities have contributed towards 'causing' the global climate to undergo the changes we are now experiencing is not an easy question to answer, but I think the evidence does point towards them doing so.

We have been burning fossil fuels intensely since the dawn of the industrial revolution almost 300 years ago, and over that period of time, we have increased our CO2 production exponentially year on year, especially as other countries began their own industrial revolution. We have not stopped increasing our CO2 production with each passing year. All that CO2 is not from natural occurrences, but from man's manufactured occurrences. All of it is 'extra' to natural phases of CO2 production, so of course, it cannot be denied that we have contributed (300 years worth) to the current levels of CO2.

With having so much CO2 around, the earth's natural carbon sinks are quite saturated and are unable to take in CO2 at levels that make much of a difference, so more CO2 is in the atmosphere than what is normally present. This warms the air, and along with the sun's constant solar radiation, the energy in the atmosphere increases which leads to more intense weather systems propagating stronger storms and greater precipitation, especially in areas where the climate tends to be more 'moderate'. What we are experiencing and witnessing today are changes to local weather systems that normally worked pretty clock-work like, that were stable and moderate within a fine-tuning. It is the fine-tuning that is breaking down, and is the first symptom of climate change.

I predict that as the atmosphere warms further, leading to greater land ice melting and finding its way into the sea, not only will there be loss of coastal regions as the seas rise, but we should be able to detect the sea rises at geographical places where the seas are channelled (bottle-necked) between landmasses, rises in sea levels will be focused at these points around the world first. Sea level rises will lead to greater amounts of precipitation over land masses, where more frequent flooding will be experienced each year.

You can argue all you want about causes of climate change, but the fact is...it is happening, and it will only become more intense. If the industrial revolution had never occurred, there would not be 300 years worth of 'extra' CO2 in the natural carbon sinks and atmosphere.

If there is one statement that really pisses me off is the 'we have to save the planet' bullshit. We are not saving the planet, we are looking to save the environments of our current habitats from being overwhelmed by events rapid in their occurrence. We can deal with slow catastrophic events, and also catastrophic events that occur in small local regions, but fast, wider-ranging events can knock us for six, and put great stressors upon our social and technological infrastructures. Just bear in mind that our greatest fragility is being dependent on electricity always available at the press of a switch, and that means that every single one of us who have commented on this thread could not handle the loss of electricity for up to just six months, let alone it disappearing forever.",UCM06euh375pxrBfgQmECeEw,0.0,UgzKNyo-qAvTkONTuVh4AaABAg,9M29ns1rUSE,2019-11-13T17:00:03Z,climate crisis

One thing that strikes me in this debate is that the warmists  constantly say that if an expert on the subject doesn't agree with them they must be getting money from BIG OIL or something similar. as if to say the if you have a financial interest in saying what you say you must be excluded from the debate
However the whole Climate Change machine is being funded by us long suffering tax payers to the tune of in excess of a Trillion Dollars globally per year. If these climate prophets get up one day and said that ,look our predictions over the last 30 years were way off the mark and the real world data is now telling us that that problem is in effect only very minor, the funding would be pulled and they would be all out of their jobs by midday.

From 1945 to now CO2 has risen from just over 300 PPM to 410 PPM approx and there has been NO acceleration in the warming trend since 1945 if anything the warming trend has slowed a little.

“lmfao i'm not going to touch base on anything besides your claims of the USA, although it's quite comical to see you have no valid credentials”

This is an Appeal to Authority Fallacy. A statement is valid on it's own merits, not the merits of those who state it; this is logic 101. 

“Now, the united states overall has taken the most drastic steps in order to reduce emissions”

False. The USA is close to dead last when it comes to renewable energy; only being powered by about 10% of it, and having the highest CO2 emissions per capita in the world, compared to other developed countries which are powered by between 40% to 100%. 

“which is varifiable”

It's not variable because based according to a REN21 report on renewable energy in every country in the world, the USA is powered by about 10% renewable energy, compared to... let's check the data. Canada... 70%, Norway... 96%, Brazil 80%, and the list is quite endless. 

“Pay attention when i say overall. Your examples are poor, and of lower industrial capability and capita”

This sentence is incoherent; however, I will say that the USA is the world leader in CO2 emissions per capita. 

“What ""pruge of environmental protections""?

Seriously? According to an analysis by  NADJA POPOVICH earlier this year, the Trump administration has removed 10 Air Pollution and Emissions regulations, 9 drilling and extraction regulations, 12 infrastructure and planning regulation, 9 animal protection regulations, 4 toxic substances and safety regulations, and 5 water pollution regulations. It's also important to know that there are currently 32 more regulation purges that are still pending; hopefully they get cancelled somehow. 

“They've gotten stronger if anything”

Not sure how you can make something stronger by getting rid of it. 

“Now, ""renewable"" energy is quite an interesting subject, and can be pretty comical given who you're discussing with. You for one don't seem to understand the massive environmental impact each form has”

I've done immense research on renewable energy; go ahead and provide an argument against it. 

“Nice quotation (""i believe in climate change, but climate science is bullshit""), but we all know quotations only work on a word for word basis, and that is not what i said, nor inferred”

It's what you suggested by denying the climatological citations in my comment. 

“If you didn't have such a nack for misinterpreting simplistix language, this would have been more productive”


It's not my fault your comments are so philosophically incoherent that it's hardly possible to even understand what you're claiming. Every time I mention some basic science, you disagree with, then claim you're all about science. 

“A HUGE part of climatology has been simulation based. All we know of climate, are events that have passed as late as roday and yesterday”

So you believe in climate change but that underlying scientific method which produced is not very reliable; gotcha. Anyways... you're conflating climate change with global warming. We know that rapid global warming will lead to rapid climate change, even if we cannot predict exactly how drastic the changes will be. Let's ignore climate change for a second and just focus on the fact that global warming will render most of the middle-east uninhabitable, sea levels will rise due to the thermal expansion of ocean, the coral reefs will be purged which will destabilize the ocean's ecosystem, the melting of the permafrost destroying infrastructure and creating yet another positive feedback loop, and of course... climate change, which is the worst effect of global warming.

“You also fail to identify main ""subsets"" such as helioseismology, meteorolgy, atmosoheric chemistry and science, etc.. geology alone does not determine what influences earth's climate”

This statement is incoherent. Climatology is a subset of geology; geology alone does determine what influences the Earth's climate, because Geology is the study of the Earth, which includes the climatology of the climate, the oceanography of the ocean, the volcanology of volcanoes, and so on. 

“Never denied real science, nor have a inferred such. Your personal opinions do not count as fact”

The scientific literature is not my opinion. Also... the term “real science” seems like a weasel phrase, what is real science if not the studies which exists within the Master Journals of Science? Which by the way... includes the Journal of Climatology.",UCa7UP_E_q8WLs-lVyFGPyMQ,1.0,Ugz2nknef1AZ0sQ_yFB4AaABAg,9M29ns1rUSE,2019-11-13T17:00:03Z,climate crisis

""All you do is parrot the same talking points""

I parrot the scientific literature, which is one demonstrable body of knowledge that only gets more accurate over time. 

""And offer no detailed explanation or actual scientific factor""

You have provided no scientific argument in your comment, just baseless assertions, so brought up that fact tha your assertions don't match the scientific literature.

""When i say global warming and climate change have been used interchangeably for decades, it's rather true, as most do so...""

This is an argumentum ad populum fallacy. 62% of the USA believe the Earth is 6,000 years old; that doesn't refute the vast body of scientific literature which states that it is 4.6 billion years old, for the same reason ""most"" people are wrong when using global warming and climate change interchangeably. The argument... ""It's okay because most people do it"" is flawed logic. 

""especially when the word anthropogenic is used""

This is even more false. Global warming is anthropogenic, climate change is caused by global warming. 

""and technicalities don't exactly help your case when that's the base of your argument""

It does help my case because you're providing a definition of global warming that doesn't conform with how the scientific literature describes it. 

""What are your credentials in order to judge percentage of inaccuracy?""

Appeal to Authority Fallacy. 

"" Which is usually around 70%""

Depends what it is you're talking about. 

""Funny how other fields of study that correlate are able to determine these vast variables with 90% or better accuracy""

Other fields are not Climatology. 

“""Climate science"" is more or less a false narrative”

Climatology, oceanography, volcanology... these are all the same scientific method being applied to different aspects of reality, and are all subsets of geology. Denying one is effectively denying them all. 

“seeing as how it relies heavily on predictions”

The entire point of the scientific method is to make predictions; that's how inductive logic and empiricism works. 

“that have been known to fail”

Depends what you mean by “fail”, all of our predictions were too conservative, we predicted temperatures would rise by 1.4 degrees, but the real number turned out to be 1.7 degrees. 

“It only effectively works off of the events we have gone through”

We predicted that temperatures would rapidly increase, we were correct, but we were off by 0.3 degrees.

“Another major point is how experimentation really only takes place in urban areas, where heat is most certainly greater, and smog thicker”

False. We measure the Earth temperatures in ocean where temperatures are not impacted by such variables. 90% of the Earth's heat is contained in the ocean. 

“Now, if you'd pay attention, i'm not dismissing the reliable side of atmospheric and earth studies...”

Yes you actually are. You just denied the whole scientific method by claiming climatology (aka geology) is unreliable.

“i'm just throwing alarmism out the window, and MSM fear mongering along with it”

The terms “alarmist” and “fear mongering” are just buzzwords with no scientific value. 

“That's rather comical you mention politics, because that's exactly what the UN and IPCC are based on”

Both the IPCC and the UN are the same thing... the UN, and the UN is not a peer reviewed scientific journal. 

“I for one highly doubt you've read any real scientific journals”

What is “journals”? We're talking about the Journal of Climatology; you know... one of the Master Journals of Science?

“You pointing fingers directly at americans (who lead in emission reduction globally)”

False. China and France lead emissions reduction around the world; in fact, the USA produces double the CO2 per capita compared to these countries. I country like Norway is powered by 100% renewable energy is a better example for emission reduction than the USA which has the highest CO2 per capita rate in the world, the USA is powered by about 15% renewable energy last time I checked, and that number might start decreasing with their president's purge of environmental protections over the last few years. 

“Anyone with a few functioning brain cells knows you can't deny climate change”

Sorry but “I believe in climate change, but climate science is bullshit” is an oxymoron. 

“The ""scientific method"" however is extremely questionable in concern to ""climate science"", as certain methodology cannot technically be considered science.... a derivative of such, maybe”

Climatology, Volcanology, and Oceanography... all subsets of geology. You cannot deny science when it gives the answers you want, but accept it otherwise.",UCa7UP_E_q8WLs-lVyFGPyMQ,1.0,Ugz2nknef1AZ0sQ_yFB4AaABAg,9M29ns1rUSE,2019-11-13T17:00:03Z,climate crisis

""global warming and climate change have been used interchangeably decades""


False. Global warming was discovered in 1896 by a Swedish scientists who conducted an experiment designed to measure the impacts of trains at the time, it later discovered in 1930s that global warming is causing climate change. 


""Overall it doesn't take away from ""hotspots"" caused by human activity. Technically not a global phenomenon""


Sorry... ""technically the warming of the globe is not global warming"" is an oxymoron. Let's recap... global warming is the warming of the glove, climate change is the changing of the climate. Very simple. 


""Existing datasets are modified when results vary far too much with major inaccuracies as told by methodology sections""


This is a incoherent word salad with no quantified criteria of accuracy. The term ""inaccuracies"" has no value until you define what accurate is. Is 98% inaccurate? 92% Inaccurate? Define your criteria, and provide a link to a peer reviewed scientific study in the Journal of Climatology that doesn't meet said criteria. 


""when real scientific research is conducted""


There are 20,000 peer reviewed scientific studies confirming climate change. 


""the issue isn't anywhere near as bad as alarmists claim""


The term ""alarmist"" has no value; the peer reviewed scientific literature states that the Earth is warming at 1.7 degrees per 100 years; whether that's ""not as bad"" as your anecdotes is irrelevant, science doesn't care about your emotions. 


""and existing datasets aren't modified in order to create a desired, agenda based outcome""


You just said they were, now you're back tracking. 


""Abstractions have their time and place""


Yeah... when data is being sampled. 


""The desired outcome is that of a fear mongering nature""


There's no such thing as ""fear mongering nature""


""The overall goal and solution of the UN is global taxation""


The solution to the problem is off-context from the problem itself. 


""So now it's 20,000, huh? Funny how the numbers ALWAYS vary with every response""


I only mentioned the vast body of scientific literature on climate change once in my earlier comments; therefore your claim is malformed logic. I say ""20,000"" because the vast body of knowledge on climate change is constantly growing, it could be 21,493 studies, it could be 23,483 studies, so I just say 20,000 to make it easier. 


""It's rather evident you've never read an actual scientific journal with attention to methodology""


My understanding of these topics comes from scientific literature. I've yet to read a peer reviewed scientific study that agrees with the bullshit American political hacks say. Most of the claims I hear are not just a denial of climate change, it's a denial of the scientific method entirely.",UCa7UP_E_q8WLs-lVyFGPyMQ,1.0,Ugz2nknef1AZ0sQ_yFB4AaABAg,9M29ns1rUSE,2019-11-13T17:00:03Z,climate crisis

""Except y'know, anthropogenic climate change""


You're conflating global warming with climate change; it's global warming that is anthropogenic, climate change are the effects of global warming. 


""climate change models are computer based""


Predicting the climate requires trillions of calculations, therefore computer based models are the most accurate. Global warming however is not based on computer models, global warming is very easy to measure. Even if we cannot predict the exact degree of climate change, we know that a rapid rise in global temperature will have a significant effect on the climate regardless. What you're saying is analogous to... ""Our computer models cannot predict the exact location the meteor will hit, therefore the meteor doesn't exist""


""with admitted modified data""


What is ""admitted modified data""? You do realize that modifying data is a good thing right? We us abstractions to make data more accurate. 


"" to produce desired outcomes""


The desired outcome of modifying data is to acquire accurate data.

You seem to reference skepticalscience a lot. I urge you to check out this site: 
http://debunkingskepticalscience.com/

About me:
I used to be skeptical to the degree of influence man had on the climate. But after reading a LOT of the climate research of IPCC I actually started believing in it. However, after extensive research into WHY so many scientists still don`t believe in their research, I have found a lot of fundamental flaws with the research of the IPCC, even false statenents and a political agenda (which does not belong in science). And no... Most scientists who don`t believe in the ""climate consensus"" (which really doesn`t mean much scientifically) are NOT paid by big oil etc. I found that it is actually the IPCC who does the propaganda part. Do your own research, like I did. Check out BOTH SIDES. And trust in real science.

I know you guys made a video about vegetarians but I think you should make a separate one about vegans. It is my understanding that animal agriculture is the number one cause of climate change and world hunger according to the U.N.  Large amounts of methane from animal feces, deforestation, huge amounts of water usage, feces contaminating water, ineffective use of food, and toxic chemicals used to make leather all involve animal agriculture. If everyone went vegan we wouldn't need to feed 20billion+ animals and we would be able to feed the 800million starving humans. Also, Animal products are extremely unhealthy, the FDA classifies processed meats as a carcinogen in the same class as cigarettes and consuming animal products as been directly linked to shorter life expectancy, obesity, high cholesterol, heart disease, strokes, and many more health issues not seeing in vegans. Also, large amounts of antibiotics are given to animals which causes bacterial resistance which could be very horrible for humans.  Finally and most importantly Animals are treated horrifically on farms and this is very sad because farm animals are some of the smartest creatures on earth. Pigs have the same cognitive ability as  3-year-old humans and are capable of opening gates and playing video games. These animals feel pain and emotion just as we do and they fear death and know when they are about to die. Farm animals often have there tails and testicles cut off without any  anesthetic at all and when they are killed they are shot with a stun gun that dents there brain to keep it ""ethical"" but a lot of times this step is skipped or doesn't work and they are fully aware while their throats are being slit and their skin is being peeled off of them or even when they are dipped in scalding hot water. Production of milk involves constantly artificially impregnating cows taking their babies away then chaining the calf to a pole then killing it for veal and the dairy cow must repeat this process it's whole life which is very short because eventually it is killed for meat. Also, egg production involves throwing 500,000 male baby chicks in a grinder every single day and keeping hens in cages and in crowded conditions where they often break bones and die of diseases. Animals used for dissection such as frogs and cats are taken out of there environments and homes and thrown in toxic chemicals alive until they die a painful death, and this is trash science and outdated because we now have more affordable software simulations that get the job done just as good if not better.

The Antarctic is accumulating ice, the Arctic is reiterating its condition of 100 years ago, the polar bears are reported fine as is the great barrier reef (by researchers who've devoted decades to their studies). The 'greenhouse' effect hasn't even been experimentally validated persistently delivering inconsistent results indicative only of its inability to alter any temperature trend.
Then, from Paul Oliver on Facebook, November 18...

1926 Black Sunday 60 dead 1,000 buildings destroyed

1939 Black Friday 71 dead 5,000 buildings destroyed

1967 Black Tuesday 62 dead 1,300 buildings destroyed

1983 Ash Wednesday 75 dead 3,000 buildings destroyed

2009 Black Saturday 180 dead 3,500 buildings destroyed

Interesting that none of our previous fires have been due to the Climate Emergency.

I do have a sneaking suspicion though, that if it wasn't for the misinformed environmentalists and the Greens who:

• Lobby to have thousands of hectares locked up,

• Campaign against back burning,

• Prevent land owners from managing the vegetation on their land,

• Push to have further barriers in the way of burn offs and fire break clearings,

• Voted in council/government authorities that do not know how to manage the bush, other than lock it up and let it grow to massive fuel loads. 

Want to blame someone, look no further than your local Greens politician.

It's funny when people talk about ""the overwhelming scientific consensus"", and yet they don't know a damn thing about the science. 1) The earth has been continually warming since the end of the Little Ice Age in 1850. This predates the invention of the internal combustion engine. 2) Atmospheric CO2 does not heat the atmosphere in a linear fashion, but rather logarithmically. If doubling CO2 causes 2 degrees higher temperatures, then you'd have to quadruple CO2 to get 2 more degrees higher temperatures. Ice core samples show that atmospheric CO2 has been as high as 8000ppm, and yet everything was fine. 3) Global temperatures and atmospheric CO2 is not highly correlated. In earth's past temperatures have gone down as CO2 went up and vice versa. The evidence shows that CO2 actually follows global temperatures, so it would be more correct to say that higher global temperatures causes higher CO2, rather than the other way around. 4) It was warmer during the Middle Ages than it is now. Historically, the earth has been much warmer, and we're in one of the coldest periods of the Holocene (the last 11,000 years of earth's history).",UCbPjUfYtRMp2zceekFumqdw,0.0,UgzftTNH8krRLER0Jqp4AaABAg,9M29ns1rUSE,2019-11-13T17:00:03Z,climate crisis

2) Not really. During the Ice Age, sea levels were so low that the eastern coast of the USA extended some 5 miles further out into sea. An entire island the size of Germany was swallowed up in the North Sea. And yet, humanity and life itself seemed to be just fine. With modern technology, keeping the sea at bay is achievable. Just ask the Danes. This is no reason to wish for a colder climate, when a colder climate makes the earth less habitable for life. 

3) Yes, other factors can influence the climate. How do you know they're not at work right now? Does anyone really know what caused the Ice Age? Or what caused it to end? Leading scientists who work in the field have a few theories, but nothing close to a consensus. In the past, global temperatures have increased while CO2 dropped and vice versa. You can't tell me CO2 is causing global temperatures to rise when we have evidence that global temperatures have risen in the paste while CO2 went down. 

4) The earth being warmer would be a great benefit to all life on the planet. Anyone who's observed the changing seasons can tell you that. The warmer the planet, the fewer things die, and all life is better able to survive the harshness of winter.",UCbPjUfYtRMp2zceekFumqdw,1.0,UgzftTNH8krRLER0Jqp4AaABAg,9M29ns1rUSE,2019-11-13T17:00:03Z,climate crisis

2. Was it really fine though? Sea levels were substantially higher. If climate was to change to that state, the vast majority of humans would be displaced in the process. It would be a catastrophe.

3. There are other factors that can influence climate. However, they are not at work right now. The effect CO2 has on the energy balance of the planet can be measured. The causality is directly observable.
Historically, CO2 increase both lagged and lead temperature increase. Two things can cause each other respectively, you know.

Then that fear grows when market solutions are brought to the table because the average person cannot afford or maybe just doesn't want to pay more taxes. People who already hold the government in contempt and distrust will hate raising taxes even if those taxes are well spent to avoid austerity. Fear of what removing fossil fuels will do to the economy is often generated by the right wing corporate media. It's also bad for economies dependant on fossil fuel resource and developing countries who require fossil fuels to develop. Land use is responsible for as much pollution as coal and developing countries are working to maximize their land use just like developed countries have done, however this means wiping out all tropical forests.

At five years old, you liked getting up early to watch captain planet. You liked your Pocahontas shirt. You felt safe and spiritual listening to the wise Grandmother Willow and the Colors of the Wind song. You felt guilty for liking these things because your parents disapproved of environmentalism. Your mom read an article against global warming while watching your swim lessons. You began homeschooling at age 10. Your last year of public school science was fourth grade. You were a very ill child who found it difficult to learn. You don't remember doing science in fifth grade. At the end of sixth grade you read an Abeka science book on your own. Abeka is a very conservative Christian homeschool curriculum company. You tried to go to public school part time in seventh grade but it didn't work out. You had one semester of science, which taught about electrical circuits, not climate. You used a Creationist book for eighth grade science. The whole book argued against evolution. You didn't do science after that. You learned that science wasn't interesting, and being interested in it would probably create unnecessary conflict with your parents that you didn't have the energy for and besides, you'd always been the obedient oldest child. If you didn't have your parents on your side with your health problems, you were going to be our of luck. You went to community college. You walked into an English class where the teacher announced ""Welcome to Environmental English."" You were scared. You were probably going to be attacked or made to feel stupid by some angry liberals. Your teacher turns out to be one of the best you've ever had before or since. He calmly teaches you how to read arguments about which power production technologies to use where. He wants you to learn to think. Maybe liberals aren't so bad after all. You still put off biology as long as possible. You transfer from there to a conservative religious university which thankfully still teaches evolution even though many in the religion don't believe in it. You walk into Intro Biology for non-science majors. You were among many students who didn't know that evolution was real. The teacher sucks, but the one lecture where he held up models of skills demonstrating ape to human evolution was neat. It makes you want to learn more later. Years pass. You de-convert from your religion. You start to wonder about science. What about it might be true and interesting, or the opposite. You hear people who probably grew up knowing things you didn't getting frustrated with people like you. You feel put in the middle of a fight between the people you came from and the people you're starting to tentatively like. If you were me, what would you do? How would you like to be spoken to, at various stages of my life?

Climate change is a fiction story.

Take for instance the fake story about big oil being the first to fund scientist studying co2. That goes back over a hundred years before big oil. We were still riding horses when the first co2 studies were done.

The problem is that co2 has never tracked temperature. The closest thing you can point to is a 25 year period that co2 and temperature both went up.

Greta is a program little emotional disabled girl being exploited to deliver a message in a manner that is manipulated. IF you disagree with her people accuse you of being a child abuser.

pseudo-science? You mean like Peer review articles in SCIENCE SPECIFIC journals. Those are journals, as an example where a marine biologist publishes in a marine biology journals and his article is reviewed by marine biologist. For instance studies on ocean dead zones where over use of fertilizer and sewage being dumped into rivers cause algae blooms which then die and bacteria feed off the dead algae and eat up all the oxygen killing the shell fish. Scientist have known about these dead zones since 1920's.
YET supposedly reputable marine biologist write articles that they publish in the OPINION sections of magazines like NATURE, and thus do not need to be peer reviewed. They use CORRELATION  as a means to prove that co2 cause the death of the shellfish.

But that is considered true science by alarmist.

Skeptical science is anything but skeptical. Its run by a political science professor.

""Those that are more individualistic (i.e. think for themselves) … are less inclined to accept the consensus."" OF course those that are program to follow like sheep will follow the loudest leader.

I've been on both sides of the fence. The biggest deception I see here is green people believing they are impervious to a narrative because they are so science minded. (Each mention of kids, the mythology of a nurturing mother earth, are both exploitations of powerful ""storytelling"".)

I'm not religious, I observe science, I'm an engineer by training. I'm not a ""climate change denier"" and would resent the label, but guess what, that still doesn't mean I agree with most climate activism. It's a mistake to think everyone who disagrees with climate politics ""denies science"", that would be not knowing your opposition.

I'm glad that you mentioned ideology though, because a person's philosophy is the absolute source of their politics which needs to be talked about more here. All the arguing about facts and scientific studies would be irrelevant if the real thing that's going in is two people don't have the same priorities and values. In this arena especially, I find so much is wasted effort because the discussion of values is skipped and it goes straight to ""science denial"" instead of value judgement. For example, I'm pro human benefit rather than pro planet conservation, that is the storytelling I listen to. If you want to make more progress and influence people who think like I do, you'd have to promote those objectives. Please look up anything by Alex Epstein, he's the best thinker on this I know, and then you'll be closer to understanding why people like me think the way we do.",UCtDsA_Bf4JRqGVd4YvNQeZw,0.0,Ugz7weKzEqiJai1PZzB4AaABAg,9M29ns1rUSE,2019-11-13T17:00:03Z,climate crisis

1251,Ugz7weKzEqiJai1PZzB4AaABAg,0.0,5.0,2020-01-20T11:21:52Z,QuiteBad,"OK so firstly, science really isn't something you can be open minded on. It's hard data. You're either correct or wrong. The earth is round and saying that flat earthers are wrong isn't being close minded. Secondly, comparing environmental activision to myths is just inaccurate. The myth of Atlantis is not backed up by any facts while climate change is backed up by hard facts. Thirdly climate change should not be political just as how the earth being flat or round shouldn't be. The scientific community brought us hard fact and politics does not influence the validity of it. Denying climate change is to deny the overwhelming science behind it.
Lastly, you claim that human benefit outweighs environmental benefit but then that would mean that you'd fully support environmental conservation efforts no? Humanity benefits from having a good relationship with the ecosystem. Many species go extinct due to human interference and because of said human interference, the future generations lost out on the ability to see said animals. Climate change too harms humans as crop failures in countries like India are going to be more often due to a more erratic weather pattern. Making climate change a political issue is counter intuitive, ignoring the science behind it is ignorant and to switch climate change from a discussion about facts to a discussion about opinions is plain stupid. We do not have much time left, and it will be the younger generation and future generations that will fill the pinch, so don't say that we're overreacting.

I know you guys made a video about vegetarians but I think you should make a separate one about vegans. It is my understanding that animal agriculture is the number one cause of climate change and world hunger according to the U.N.  Large amounts of methane from animal feces, deforestation, huge amounts of water usage, feces contaminating water, ineffective use of food, and toxic chemicals used to make leather all involve animal agriculture. If everyone went vegan we wouldn't need to feed 20billion+ animals and we would be able to feed the 800million starving humans. Also, Animal products are extremely unhealthy, the FDA classifies processed meats as a carcinogen in the same class as cigarettes and consuming animal products as been directly linked to shorter life expectancy, obesity, high cholesterol, heart disease, strokes, and many more health issues not seeing in vegans. Also, large amounts of antibiotics are given to animals which causes bacterial resistance which could be very horrible for humans.  Finally and most importantly Animals are treated horrifically on farms and this is very sad because farm animals are some of the smartest creatures on earth. Pigs have the same cognitive ability as  3-year-old humans and are capable of opening gates and playing video games. These animals feel pain and emotion just as we do and they fear death and know when they are about to die. Farm animals often have there tails and testicles cut off without any  anesthetic at all and when they are killed they are shot with a stun gun that dents there brain to keep it ""ethical"" but a lot of times this step is skipped or doesn't work and they are fully aware while their throats are being slit and their skin is being peeled off of them or even when they are dipped in scalding hot water. Production of milk involves constantly artificially impregnating cows taking their babies away then chaining the calf to a pole then killing it for veal and the dairy cow must repeat this process it's whole life which is very short because eventually it is killed for meat. Also, egg production involves throwing 500,000 male baby chicks in a grinder every single day and keeping hens in cages and in crowded conditions where they often break bones and die of diseases. Animals used for dissection such as frogs and cats are taken out of there environments and homes and thrown in toxic chemicals alive until they die a painful death, and this is trash science and outdated because we now have more affordable software simulations that get the job done just as good if not better. Also, much money is wasted on funding trash science where they torture animals for no reason other than they get funding for it so it is an easy way to make money (not talking about all animal experiments just most of them). There is so much more cruelty that goes on but I can't talk about all of it. Of course, I don't want you to take my word for it but instead, do your own research and please make a video about it. Thank you for taking the time to read this and I hope you go vegan and take the time to make a video about this.",UCbyaQpv7s3keaxO-8QH0Xgg,0.0,Ugz46b4tFvasIkYQdEp4AaABAg,9M29ns1rUSE,2019-11-13T17:00:03Z,climate crisis

It was the boom of new technology at the time. New ideas created new technology, which enabled the industrial revolution. So the first step is accepting of the premise that ideas and technology made America great, not coal and oil.

The worse climate change predictions can't compare to the horrors of the 7 year tribulation especially the last 3 1/2 years when all hell breaks loose.

However I do find that you can make some success by planting seeds that beat climate change denial at its own game (success judged by change in opinion in follow up conversations). 

For instance when I hear that it is too expensive to subsidize green tech and infrastructure I point out that we already heavily subsidize oil production here in Canada and that oil is one of the most capital intensive, labour non intensive industries out there and that it needs to be that way for the companies to keep up the way they have been (for those of you who work in the Alberta oil sands, how much money goes into just the purchase of the heavy mining equipment that was built in other countries vs your annual salary). I contrast this with the amount of Human Resources go into creating a windmill or a solar panel where the labour costs are a significantly higher proportion of the final cost of the product. Labour cost equals jobs and jobs equal families with a wage to live off of. 

Or for people who don’t trust the government. I point out that most researchers work for private companies or universities and that the vast majority of green tech development is being done by private entities. The government just thinks it’s a good idea to support them, much like they have done for oil, gas, and coal. 

And the most important thing that I find you can do is to listen to the other person because they probably have concerns, fears, and misconceptions just like us. It is very easy to become preachy and then nobody listens at all.

After all the all encompassing, self perpetuating cycle of warming begetting co2 begetting warming creates a runaway warming loop which clearly has not happened.

According to the 2014 Cook et al study which you media shills and dim-witted conformists are so fond of misquoting, 97% of 33% of the 12000 climate experts included in this meta-study believed humans are causing the slight increase in average global temperature observed since the mid 19th century and the sea-level rise which has been consistent for hundreds of years.

This means that the 66% of the 12000 climate experts not included because they took no position on a human cause of current and potential future weather, plus 3% of those who have taken a position total about 67% of climate experts who do not think humans are causing climate change or are remaining neutral on the subject. 

That's a pretty clear consensus: they don't know. So why is the media still shrieking about doomsday, and the world ending in 12 years? 

Oh ya, it's that $70 trillion of public money which world governments are planning to spend on some undefined solution to this unproven problem in the next decade instead of feeding all those starving children as the Red Cross suggests.

And I have asthma. A few weeks ago, my 11 yo brother called me asking if I took my pollution mask with me. When I said I didn't, he actually yelled at me, that I need to take care of my health, that maybe we can meet up so he can give me his.
I am 23 yo. I am the one that has to take care of it. When I was 11,  my biggest concern was far from worrying about a family member that might suffocate while walking around the city...
When I want to speak of climate change, I just point out that we are half into november and that it is 11 degrees Celsius  outside. We used to have snow at that time, now we didn't have a proper snow day for two years. What gets on my nerves is when people go saying ""oh yeah but I don't like the cold, so it's actually cool"".

Filters can help you with low level of air pollution. When the smog, smoke , ashes degrades the quality of life of every organism then it is detrimental. To be true we can't have filters set on as we move around in our city and transportation. Don't you think this stuff is unhealthy in general conscience for our planet? How are this animals and plants gonna live in such polluted environment? If it disrupts the food chain it is slowly gonna kill humans too. 
I have bronchitis which is a milder version of Asthama and i can safely say that even smelling some type of perfumes or incense can trigger it. It is easily triggered by monoxide, nitrogen oxide compounds released in even automobiles. 
I would like to end my case my saying a clean air, water and soil is the basic human needs for growth of a healthy humankind as well as of other organisms. Through and through we have found in various researches that humankind's ignorant behaviour is causing destruction of living nature. See earth doesn't concern itself with all this stuff. It is us who gonna die in mass extinction. The day humans die in a mass extinction earth will be back to its course. Maybe millions of years later once again a new species will grow and rule earth.

THESE ARE THE FACTS... 
The world population is increasing. We need more food! How to grow more food? (1) A warmer climate. (2) More food for the plants i.e CO2 in the air. Luckily we have seen improvements already.  We have slowly gotten out of the Little Ice Age during the last 1-200 years with the planet warming up again, and with higher levels of CO2 we have seen a greening of the planet the last decades, which has resulted in a huge increase in global food production. 

The data: https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/carbon-dioxide-fertilization-greening-earth? 

The data shows that global warming is having a dramatic positive effect on crop yields. As an example, the average corn yields (measured in tons per hectare) in the USA since 1940, have INCREASED MORE THAN FIVE-FOLD! We see more or less the same trends in Europe and rest of the world for most of the major food crops. Access to cheap fossil fuel has allowed us to grow food ever more efficient, and against all odds, we are now able to feed the growing world population. Famine is now half of what it was 30 years ago. Only populations without access to fossil fuel are starving today! 

The data: https://ourworldindata.org/yields-and-land-use-in-agriculture

There is a lot more food and wealth per capita now than it used to be, thanks to cheap fossil fuel. And because of this and unprecedented access to cheap fossil fuel during the last 100 years, we are now better off, when it comes to economy, health, education, technology, social equality, war/peace, etc than any time in our known history. We are in a time with more resources and human well-being than ever before. 

AND IT'S GETTING BETTER EVERY YEAR! :) 

A hundred years ago you were more educated than most if you could read, and wealthier than most if you owned shoes. And you had to work 12+ hours every day just to put food on the table. We should be thankful for living in this time and not in the ages before us. The generations living today are more privileged than any generation before us, thanks to cheap fossil fuel.

2. What specific solution can we do now to stop climate changed that won't destroy our economy?
3. How will the government use our taxes to stop climate change and how much exactly will it cost?

How you make up  constant cooling since 2500 years i do not know, there were several warmer periods then today like the roman warming and to repeat: The last cooling phase was exceptionaly strong. I already explained to you how it has come to this enormous polarisation on the climate issue. Are you american? Your president is one of those heretics, so is India, China and Russia, 97% is a joke that no one is talking aout anymore, this flawed study was easily debunked. You are not up to date, you talk like somone from the past, 10 years ago.
The reasons how it is possible that the consensus side can not accept their own missing explationary power is A: Because it is hard to admit it after 30 years of believing and useless modelling. And B because their uncertanty itself allows them to escape into scenarios and guessing games. The uncertainty is GIVEN  since there is an uncertainty of 1,5° till 4,5° from the beginning on, while we silently narrowed ourselfs towards 1,5°C by now. From there on it is a tiny step to no expressivness whatsoever, since we come to a point where 1,5° is not far from a natural trend. Meaning that all the IPCC and your precious consensus does, is just documenting a natural trend. So please stop hiding behind your consensus and start with arguments on your own, or have the humbleness to say that you do not know anything yourself.
Since this is not rocket science but highly interdisciplinary research ,you can learn a lot by yourself.

3. It does not need a conspiracy and it is not 97%. What it needs is a reproduction crisis, a super institution (IPCC) with a mandate, a blind love for complex models that will never be accurate enough (climate uncertanty relation) and usefull idiots like you. The fact that we are guessing with a forcing originally of 1,5°C till 4,5°C is in itself proof that there is uncertainty. If you take a closer look, the UN is anything but a majority, every bigger country has its own research, the russians, chinese, USA and India are obviously not buying it. The russians seems to get it right btw, their model meets the observations and what they do is they neglect CO2. This pseudo consensus might be your sharpest argument, in the end it is blunt.

Notice how Global warming has been dropped Climate change?
Define Climate emergency towards action.
Ocean cleanup, Recycle programs and alternative energy sources can all be pushed right now, for sure and who could disagree.
As a denier i believe our climate is changing.
Because of my concern i have spent many years researching this topic.
 The 97% consensus is a manipulated lie towards an end and that end finds itself rooted in politics.
Very credible scientists and even Nasa agree that our Sun has entered into a cyclical phase known known as the Grand Solar minimum. This 250-300 year cycle has repeated itself over time and here we are.
Valentina Zharkova, a mathematician and Astrophysicist used Nasa data to develip a predictive algorithm that has been 97% accurate over the last 10 years in predicting changing conditions on our sun, its dimming.
Although stable enough, our Sun cyclically changes in dynamic output.
The Sun is a dynamo, like a motor that creates power, invthe suns case, heat and light.
Circulating fields of plasma within the sun will periodically result in less output and hence weaken the light we receive.
When discussing CO2 the media seldom ever discuss whichbis not questioned to perpetuate the CO2 idea.
The dirty thirties with the dust bowls, the dark ages featuring frigid climate, the ice ages did not feature man's effect.
Zharkova six years ago predicted a major lessening of sunspots, which are a symptom of what i speak.
Only one other model agree, while alarmists predicted our earth would continue to heat.
You will see what the truth is and its not caused by CO2.
Within days parts of the midwest may receive temperatures 30 degrees below normal setting over 150-200 low record temperatures.
Nature is moving us into a cooling period, where temperature progressively get colder and winters longer.
This year only 52% of corn crops have been harvested and this cold snap may devestate what is still unharvested.
This is why definition and truth is required. Where our actions are directed may be critical toward protecting food crops affected by these extremes.
Alarmists are quick to accuse big oil of coverup, but consider this.
Climate change has been called a 100 trillion dollar issue, held and directed by who?
The money and power through legislation to control industry and governments around the world would be huge.

However, this fails to acknowledge the cost of placing more expensive buildings, technologies and other products in the path of hurricanes as a relevant consideration of damage.

As for the ideological divide, its a myth that urban intellectuals are stuck on.  Left vs. right is irrelevant its ecocentric vs technocentric that matters.

Im not gonna go that in depth, but Ill give a couple points- please go fact check me! Im mainly using the Greenland Ice cores data.

Over the past 10,000 years the earth has been cooling. There are oscilltions of warmth followed by cold, but overall these oscillations of temperature have been getting colder and colder. It got to the point where in the 1850’s there was more glaciers than theres been since the LAST ICE AGE. Our frame of reference is completely screwy. We arent comparing the temperature to what has been the avg over the past 10,000 yrs. We’re comparing it to the coldest its been in the last 10000 years.

I already mentioned the oscillations of temperature, it is completely normal for the temperature to rise and fall 2 or 3 degrees celsius every couple of hundreds of years and were saying humans are the cause of the increase of 1 degree celsius.

If we’re saying that it is the CO2 were pumping into the air thats causing it, that simply isn’t the case. Were on a completey normal change in temperature. Additionally, if you look at  CO2 levels over the past 150,000 years, you’ll see that they have been relatively constant until the Industrial Revolution. How would you explain every single period of warming and cooling before then? How would you explain the cause of the last ice age and how we came out of it, if CO2 is the reason? Now im not saying this isn’t bad for the environment, I’m also not saying that we aren’t treating our planet like absolute shit. I’m just saying that we aren’t contributing the warming of the planet to the extent (if at all) as we think we are.",UCr1e-2Si0o9W_k0NloaXjkA,0.0,UgzViamQ6SeYATrITfF4AaABAg,9M29ns1rUSE,2019-11-13T17:00:03Z,climate crisis

I'd like to offer a different perspective why you're not converting climate change deniers
1 - they are mostly boomers or 30yo boomers, if it was possible to discuss with them even on more relaxed issues, ""ok boomer"" wouldn't be a standard anticlimactic (the irony...) communication ending. Just leave them alone, you can't change them, you can't teach an old boomer new ideas.
2 - For the rest of them, humans are tribal animals. You're not part of their tribe or not trying to smooth with them on common grounds. After some time of trying to genuinely be supportive and understanding on real issues with them (es. economical issues), accepting your ideas about climate and stuff will be a possibility, like trying to understand the point of view of a friend. Instead, you're being a condescending know-it-all. The ""upper lip disgust"" and the ""finger-pointing crusades"" destroy human relations with anyone, anywhere, anytime since the dawn of civilization. Also, you're not projecting a calm and assertive leadership (like captains Picard/Sisko/Janeway/Kirk) but CEOism, at best: google ""differences ceo toddler"", from a satirical book by Sarah Cooper, the comedian. I understand it's hard to learn to be a good leader and listen to people, that's why we have so few of them.
3- Greta is seen like the little girl version of Gilderoy Lockhart in Harry Potter, if he had Dolores-Umbridge-like parents. You're saying now, ""No, she isn't!"". But:
  - tell anyone ""don't use airplanes, just travel with your friends' yachts around the world!"". If they think there's no problem with it, well ok you're in a yacht club. To normal people it's like ""eat cake instead of bread!"". Not cool bro.
  - un-organic (ironic!) virtue signalling media presence and fanboys everywhere.
  - real scientists weren't listened to that much and invited around like her before, especially on yacht rides, as big spokerpeople, as leaders of social movements and the like.
Therefore, unironically citing Greta to some people, it's like seriously quoting Trump's tweets to you: instant thought: ""gosh such people in this party, le'ts call an Uber, I need an emergency beam-out"". Personally, they're both very unappealing. Sure Greta is more on the scientific side, but that's for the virtue-signalling, not for the science itself.",UC-40RUavPifvDi9SW7JSLqA,0.0,UgypDjWnwpIW8qQzJlZ4AaABAg,9M29ns1rUSE,2019-11-13T17:00:03Z,climate crisis

Which is also what I think needs to happen. We need to be able to trust scientists again without fearing corruption, agendas or political affinity. Scientists should be a neutral source of facts. The opinion of any leader or follower should not matter against truth. So, we need to punish people in power that are lying to the public. Seriously punish them and slowly undo the damage that has been done. That's just for me though, some people don't care and just like being part of a group. You'll never convince them.

I disagree partly with the human activity portion. While I agree that we do play a role changes in our environment, the distance our planet is from the sun is the most contributing factor to the temperature of the Earth.  We do not orbit the sun in a perfect circle by any axis, in fact no two cycles are the same. These changes as skeptical science points out indeed take long periods of time, though there are times when temperatures on Earth dropped or rose significantly and abruptly.  The last Ice Age lasted for 2.58 million years, and then in a span of 11,700 years thawed out to where we are today.  Putting that into perspective, when we as humans think that we cause significant climate change to this planet that has been enduring consistently and constantly changing climate patterns.  Of course we are more focused on how climate change effects humans and the environment and not the Earth as a whole.  The fact of the matter is that even if we kill all the cows, stop all the factories, eliminate all CO2 emission, we probably wouldn't put a dent in the current climate patterns.  Significant change to the planet's climate even if every single one of us adopted a green lifestyle would probably not happen before some other natural disaster.

Disclosure: I am 52 years old and in complete disagreement with nearly all of the popular radical governmental proposed policies.  For example When The Green New Deal was initially published many of us labeled climate-deniers declared it a joke and its details were taken down soon afterward.  I also denounce most of the fear-pron science fueling it.  However I do hope that everyone in this world would first do their part in reducing the negative planetary effects of our ever-increasing footprint.  I bring reusable bags to the supermarket, minimize driving time by planning efficient routes and errands , and in many cases use hand tools and eco-friendly products.
The radical approach will not work and I urge you and everyone else touting higher moral and intellectual standards to alter your approach and keep focused on the goal at hand.
For example witnessing pro climate change politicians, celebrities and figureheads taking countless private jets and boating trips screams Orwellian and doesn’t help the narrative at all.  Always better to lead by example.

▪""-> climate change is a hoax"" 
 
Never said climate change is a hoax at all. The climate always changes. Always has changed, always will change.
It's the claim of 'man made global warming' that is the hoax. There is zero evidence of man causing global warming (or that warming is even a 'bad' thing in the first place). In fact there is zero evidence of any warming at all, especially in light of the fact that the globe is actually COOLING, not warming. Looks like you have been sucked in big time with all the 'global warming' propaganda there. Poor bugger.

There have been many times in the past when Co2 levels were way higher than now, yet temperatures were cooler than now, showing that Co2 is completely unrelated to global temperatures.

Don't forget, Google is owned by those power hungry globalists who are pushing the 'climate emergency' scam for their own ends.

That's why I gave those links, so people can see both sides of the story, not just one side, which is what propaganda is - just pushing one side of the story while closing down any debate, i.e., climate scamers calling their story ""settled science"", which it most certainly isn't, as shown by decades of climate predictions/prophesies that never happened. Not even close.
Whenever someone keeps making predictions that never happen, then they are obviously full of shit. All the scientific-sounding story telling in the world is not going to get around that. All these jokers are doing is bending some observations to fit their narrative, and then trying to convince us that they have 'empirical evidence'.

2. That is not how socialism has to be implemented. And it is not about money either. Socialism isn't concerned with money. It's ideology is about how work and means of production should be distributed and organized. Again. I would object to this belief because of the human nature. Not because it is evil. It is not. It could be a very smooth transition from capitalism to socialism. 
I think both capitalism and socialism are nonsense. Both are extremes which doesn't work. 
I prefer a social market economy. 

4. I can understand that. But activism has to mobilize and not necessarily to convince. Except perhaps in the US the majority of people are informed enough that this is a urgent problem. The problem was a loud political voice. In reality many people in power and even the majority of the voters will not be faced with the major consequences and this is the reason they don't act. And before Greta I have not recognized a political movement in my country. She mobelized the part of society which is directly faced with the consequences.
In my opinion this is activism. But I agree that she will not convince people. But again. Except perhaps in the US this is not the issue.

5.-6. But nuclear energy is limited nevertheless. It is even not capable of producing 50% of the energy needs in the next 50 years. The major part of the energy we use world wide will be produced by other forms of energy.

Using nuclear energy is not necessary but easier to make the transition. Because the transition can be smoother. 

I would say it depends on where you live and where you build a nuclear power plant. 
I don't want them in my country. We are densely populated. No matter where the reactor is, it will be a catastrophy if something goes wrong. Because of easy targets for terrorists alone the value at risk is to high for me.

In the US however you have plenty of space. The value at risk is drastically lower. If you build nuclear power plants in the right places this would be a reasonable and low risk way towards a CO2-neutral future. And if not so many countries (as it seems right now) are using nuclear power as the major solution it could last much longer. It might even give the US an industrial advantage.",UCxY_EHgyeTc4fIpE2qVM2jQ,1.0,Ugy4gLk0dZMEcE5u9jF4AaABAg,9M29ns1rUSE,2019-11-13T17:00:03Z,climate crisis

Ah yes. Someone willing to have a civil discussion, I appreciate you.

In response.
1. We agree for the most part.
2. Indeed socialism is against human nature. But it is evil, because to implement socialism is to forcefully take money away from the individuals who earned the money in a system that is in truth, very far from taxation. Socialism is theft.
4. Greta is not a good activist because she presents too much violatile emotions, many of which are accusatory in nature. To get individuals on your side you need to present your argument, find common ground, or at the very least respect the other party. She rarely does any of these things, making her very off putting.
5-6. Uranium and Iridium nuclear powerplants produce the greatest energy outout per working area (land). Than windfarms and solar farms. Not to mention that nuclear energy is a stable energy not reliant on changing weather conditions. (A bad storm season could render solar farm output far below what is needed to maintain energy consumption). Lastly,  solar panels use rare metals that need to be mined, and processed much in the same way that nuclear does. The only difference is that nuclear is more stable and efficient. Large scale wind farms would kill many birds, alter migratory patterns, and take up a substantial amount of land that should be used for farming.

It's a mixture of facts and opinion. 

1. True. The world is not ending in 12 years (or anything near in the future). It is drastically changing to our disadvantage in the next 80 years and the biggest changes can only be avoided by acting in the next 10-20 years. 
2. Not evil. Quite the contrary. But against human nature (humans are overwhelmingly selfish by nature) and therefore not working. 
3. daah. Tautology
4. Opinion. She said over and over again that we should look at the science and do what scientists suggest. And cited scientific facts. Quite perfect message in my opinion.
5. Only a transitional solution according to science.
6. Nuclear energy is not a long-term solution right now. We would need a massive technology jump to nuclear fussion for example to get it there. Other renewable energy is easily available and covers multiple times the energy needed. In every location on earth.

I always return with the fact that we live in the sunniest and windiest province in the country. We have the space and location to be at the forefront of wind and solar energy in the country. Choosing not to sell oil wholesale outside of our province is better for our economy. It also would put us on the leading edge of the energy shift, which is when companies have the greatest potential to make money. I don't know if making the executives of the oil and gas corporations the bad guys helps or not. I know people are angry about it, or at least frustrated, but it usually translates to 'if they got to make money from this industry for the last century, why shouldn't I get to?' No one likes to hear that the company they work for doesn't benefit the workers as much as the executives, but perhaps the potential of working your way up the company makes them less likely to condemn it? I really struggle with trying to understand blue collar, on the ground workers being on the same side as the highly paid upper echelons of the companies they work for.


I find being an environmentalist very difficult out here. There are so many people who are actively hostile towards even simple things like reusable water bottles and canvas shopping bags. As if trying to create less waste is a bad thing in and of itself. I know there are people here who do care and who do see the both the environmental and financial benefits of greening our economy as well as our lifestyles, but it does feel a bit like shouting into our abundant prairie wind and having the sound go nowhere.",UCsewwPEEtnR7O1YEsUvCY-A,0.0,UgypqmJQQxHycFVB7ZF4AaABAg,9M29ns1rUSE,2019-11-13T17:00:03Z,climate crisis

The expression was first used by sociologist John Lofland in his 1966 study of a group of members of the Unification Church of the United States, Doomsday Cult: A Study of Conversion, Proselytization, and Maintenance of Faith. A classic study of a group with cataclysmic predictions had previously been performed by Leon Festinger and other researchers, and was published in his book When Prophecy Fails: A Social and Psychological Study of a Modern Group That Predicted the Destruction of the World.

Referring to his study, Festinger and later other researchers have attempted to explain the commitment of members to their associated doomsday cult, *even after the prophecies of their leader have turned out to be false* . Festinger explained this phenomenon as part of a coping *mechanism called dissonance reduction* , a form of rationalization. Members often dedicate themselves with *renewed vigor* to the group's cause after a failed prophecy, and rationalize with explanations such as a belief that their actions forestalled the disaster, or a belief in the leader when *the date for disaster is postponed* .

Psychology is very complex so it is hard to say a specific strategy in changing minds on this.  One thing I think is helpful is mass public education on the topic.  The more Ads, YouTube videos, Teachers, Journalists, educating the public the better.

Thank you for making these videos on Climate Change.

It's not a forever alternative but it's clean, green, cheaper, more efficient, and has higher yields. The fear of nuclear ""chernobyl"" explosions should be put to rest. The science in cooling nuclear rods with things that block *more* radiation as opposed to less when it gets heated is basically the solution to positive feedback loops that cause meltdown making it impossible to reach meltdown. Finally, the nuclear waste produced by these plants can be easily contained but does exist. This is why it can't be a permanent solutions but we as a planet can contain this waste for a few decades without issue; no water pollution, air pollutants, carbon release, or nuclear runoff. This waste will be irradiated for thousands of years but as an interim solution, is the only reliable choice really. Then after solar panels that last longer than a couple years that can be built, repaired, and replaced at sensible cost, that will be a better, perhaps permanent, solution.


As an aside, I wouldn't recommend windmills. If we were to somehow wind farm for the world's energy, taking that energy from the atmosphere, that has unforeseeable effects the same way Carbon emissions does. This is a real thing btw. Wind energy isn't some infinite source. It's taking our planet's climate, reducing it's kinetic energy, and using that.

However, the part about using classic pro-business buzzwords like choice, innovation, security, etc. does sound like something they might actually get behind, but I still wouldn't see them supporting government action on the issue such as subsidizing new energy sources, or regulating fossil fuel companies, as that would be, in their eyes, unfair (without regard to what governmental favor has already been shown towards fossil fuels), so it feels like it'd be a win in the ideological battle of just getting them to acknowledge that a solar start up in the neighborhood might be good (they're actually already there, as they often talk about wanting to go off the grid, which is a type of freedom solar and wind might permit), but not much as far as making them any more amenable to the action that need be taken against climate change is concerned.",UCwnegY35QuVOQGmw3u-6lyQ,0.0,UgyvV5xILojsMNZ9OQh4AaABAg,9M29ns1rUSE,2019-11-13T17:00:03Z,climate crisis

If corporations held this mindset, if they lobbied day and night for lower taxes on the poor, offering to bare the burden of our social programs without prompting, we'd be living in a much different society.

The Climate Change Movement has the characteristics of all major historical  movements  including that of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (the NAZI Party and Hitler) and the Bolsheviks in Russia (Communism and Lenin)
There is an enemy, and for this cause the enemy is humankind and oil and natural gas
The cause is presented as the one and only truth, which is not understood, but rather for which there is certainty in the minds of the movement and  includes deliberate misrepresentation of the facts
To strengthen the movement coercion and bullying are now both abundantly applied by those holding powerful government positions
The movement has a fanatical core, with millions of followers (who often have a personal benefit related to this movement) all having blind obedience to the cause with hatred and intolerance towards others and the current state; which must be destroyed and not simply reformed
The cause, starting out as noble, has now evolved with the goal of Socialism and Communism (e.g., Fidel Castro). In less than 25 years, the Climate Change Movement has taken control of many governments, the media, politicians, individual citizens, some of the scientific community, and many UN agencies.",UCxPiIo1pI9Ew89jOmG5mJSg,1.0,UgyhFk-Ujg5FY_RW3xB4AaABAg,9M29ns1rUSE,2019-11-13T17:00:03Z,climate crisis

What’s wrong with that logic?*  Just as America is suffering from record cold temperatures and early snow, actress Jane Fonda wants to put fossil fuel executives on trial as war criminals for causing “global warming.”  Jane ignores the fact that without fossil fuels we would quickly starve because we need oil and natural gas to produce, process, transport, and store food.  No fossil fuels means no food.  Windmills and solar panels are worthless junk for large scale energy production, and food production is highly energy intensive. 

Carbon dioxide creates and fuels all life on Earth, and adding more CO2 to our atmosphere makes plants grow faster, larger, and more resistant to drought.  Despite what the politician financed IPCC tells us, there has never been any legitimate evidence that CO2 causes warming.  Computer programs fed erroneous assumptions is not proof of anything.  

Politician driven climate hysteria has become so irrational that zealots wish to ban meat and dairy products because cattle produce methane gas, which makes up just .00017% of our atmosphere.  No sane scientist believes trace gases have any significant effect on climate.  Replacing fossil fuels for energy production with fusion power would be beneficial, but we do not know when that will be possible.

The reason for this is that she’s not really interested in science and she doesn’t really want to inform herself excessively, reading all these studies, dedicate a lot of time to it. (-> Teenager) She admits that she neither has the information to prove or disprove climate change, but it seems made up. I want to talk to her about this, and like show her the data and so on, but I‘m scared it’ll seem condescending and boring and panicky and thus driving her even further away.

I am not sure about more readable or accessible sources.  Anyone can download these files.  I cannot make it simpler. The temperature data is from NASA, and the CO2 information from the USA's EPA.  It does take time to understand what is what, but I am confident I have done this correctly as I contrasted the NASA information with that from the UK Meteorological Office (Hadley Centre, or just Hadley).


The time are not arbitrary.  They are an outcome of looking for the trends in the entire data set first.  At first, I think I split it into 5-6 time periods.  Then after closer assessment landed where you see here.   Notwithstanding your comment about accessing data, anyone can make graphs of these time periods and they ought to come out with the same answer. This might address more than one of your points.  


My view on this is that I am correct.  I, as a scientist with the word Science in all of my university degrees, am qualified to assess data.  I am qualified to seek data first in the environment of interest and to understand its meaning.  No honest scientist would write a theory and then look for data to support it. If any other scientist were to assess this data, I will be shocked if they were to say I am completely wrong. I will agree with you that it's not directly obvious unless the graphs are included.   I believe there is value in each person making such graphs and thinking for themselves.


When you say ""other sources"", I am not sure what you mean.  My source for the data is as listed.  The observations are mine.  If someone has different observations, I am open to listen and learn.  I will not entertain comments about the data, the data is not mine as I already noted.

Hey, I appreciate that it looks like you put in some effort, but I didn't find this very helpful. 

Could you use sources that are a bit more readable? You shouldn't expect people to do the analysis of data without explanation, how would a human actually use this?

And why did you use completely arbitrary stretches of years? From 25 to 2 to whatever? That doesn't seem very honest, especially when you then mention a lack of a linear relationship between CO2 and temperatures. Even taking a linear relationship for granted, you wouldn't be able to see that with arbitrary amounts of time while also showing percentage changes rather than linear changes.

Even if you're completely right, this is no way to show that's the case. If you want to convince people with data honestly, you have to present your data honestly. If you don't know how to analyze and show data you should probably leave that to scientists who's job that literally is.

There is significant corroborating evidence exists to support the observed changes in temperature.  A couple of examples from North America:


Mt. Baker glaciers (which I first visited in 1975) reached their maximum extent of the past century in 1915 which is consistent with the cooling period from 1878 to 1911.  They then retreated during the subsequent warming period. The following cooling period saw strong advancement of the glaciers.  Warming following 1976 resulted in retreat.  The extent of the glaciers now is about the same as in 1950. 

In the other direction, the increases during 1911 to 1938 was caused by anomalous tropical sea surface temperatures which extended warm waters into the far north Atlantic and cooler waters into the eastern Pacific oceans. 30 of the 50 US States and 9 of the 10 Canadian Provinces set record high temperatures during the 1911 to 1938 period which to this point in time have never been exceeded. See Schubert et al (2004) NASA.

The planet earth is a complex and fluid entity. Earth is often, and by most only, thought of as a “solid” planet.  The earth hurtles through space elliptically orbiting its sun, and rotating and wobbling on a tilted axis.  The earth is impacted by the gravities of the sun and the other planets.  The other planets have different periods, and shape of orbit around the sun.  The earth has been evolving for more than 4 billion years. The earth is not in a closed system.  The earth’s energy comes from the sun.  The sun is the most important aspect to climate.

During these 4+ billion years, climate trends have changed numerous times centered around 1) the earth’s position relative to the sun, 2) changes to the activity of the sun, and 3) the earth’s magnetosphere.

As regarding the earth’s relative position, and the orbit, tilt, and wobbliness of the earth (there is a scientific word for “wobbliness” but I can’t recall) there are specific intervals that drive climate being of 100,000 years, 41,000 years and 23,000 years. First mathematically proved by Milanković in the early 1920s, and reconfirmed mathematically most recently by the Spectral Mapping Project in 1989. This was geologically confirmed in the rock record in 2010 (“Links between eccentricity forcing and the 100,000-year glacial cycle”, Nature Geoscience, L.M. Lisiecki, 2010.)

Milanković took previous theories and observations to the next level.  Telescopes have been around for a few hundred years.  A few insightful early astronomers (especially James Croll of Scotland) and geologists during the 1800s had suggested that changes in the earth’s climate were a result of astronomical forces and this is what caused the ice ages on earth (or as some like to call them, the glacial, and inter-glacial periods). Their contemporaries (sounds familiar already!) outright rejected these notions.  Charles Darwin did accept their work however. Milanković’s first work on this effort described how the earth’s temperature is based on the sun [A Contribution to the Theory of Mathematical Climate; 1912].

Fast forward through more than 25 years of fascinating mathematics, including creating vectors of each planet and their relationship to each other which resulted in “New Results of the Astronomic Theory of Climate Changes”; 1938.  That was a headache bit of math before computers.  Now NASA/JPL can give you that up to the minute! There have been numerous others who have taken this work and reduced the uncertainty of the calculations.  Even Ms. Lisiecki’s geology work referenced above relied on earlier concepts but expanded the investigation and analysis of the Spectral Mapping project (mentioned above).

Actually, I am a BELIEVER. I believe CO2 has nothing to do with anything. They are the skeptics!  I get your point however.  

This entire issue reminds me of Ernest Shackleton’s words when he returned from the Antarctica “has the world gone mad?”

The issue is of science, but also of society.  The social issues have now overtaken the science.  I started my own look into this after questions of the family of “what did I think”?  When I started looking into this my first thought was “has the world gone mad”? 
All of my university degrees has the word “Science” on the diploma.  I do not work in the energy or transportation industries; although I consider them the “canary in the coal mine”.  I did spend a total of 9 years working for a company that worked (on partnership) on technology development with NASA/JPL.  I was front and center on that work.  The best part?  I learned an awful lot about what I now call “honest science”, and particularly how to assess data and as best I can remove bias’. To be clear, I was never a JPL employee.  While JPL is tied to NASA, the JPL employees do not work for the federal government.  I do not know if this is similar to CSIRO or not.

The solar radiation pass through the greenhouse and traps thermal energy inside emitted by the plants inside 
Solar radiation falls on earth (ie plants grown in the greenhouse) and gasses(like the glass in green houses) does not allow the heat to escape 

The gasses are called greenhouse since they absorb infrared light as the molecules change their symmetry when light falls upon them (Infrared active molecules)

Now they both block heat from escaping in different ways, as the greenhouse blocks convection,  the thickening atmosphere keeps the planet warm by preventing wavelengths of infrared radiation from escaping, but the metaphor is similar in principle and commonly used for familiarity with wider audiences.",UCfrlG4_bVxqWp2F1UlpvqqQ,1.0,UgzaPoCKc4j_UmyTXYx4AaABAg,9M29ns1rUSE,2019-11-13T17:00:03Z,climate crisis

This form of climate change is separate from the natural occurrences that contribute to changing temperatures such as the Milankovitch cycles and  S.A.M.
Overall in the long term it will contribute to higher temperatures and we have seen this in places like Scotland that has seen record breaking temperatures.

The Climate Change Movement has the characteristics of all major historical  movements  including that of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (the NAZI Party and Hitler) and the Bolsheviks in Russia (Communism and Lenin)
There is an enemy, and for this cause the enemy is humankind and oil and natural gas
The cause is presented as the one and only truth, which is not understood, but rather for which there is certainty in the minds of the movement and  includes deliberate misrepresentation of the facts
To strengthen the movement coercion and bullying are now both abundantly applied by those holding powerful government positions
The movement has a fanatical core, with millions of followers (who often have a personal benefit related to this movement) all having blind obedience to the cause with hatred and intolerance towards others and the current state; which must be destroyed and not simply reformed
The cause, starting out as noble, has now evolved with the goal of Socialism and Communism (e.g., Fidel Castro). In less than 25 years, the Climate Change Movement has taken control of many governments, the media, politicians, individual citizens, some of the scientific community, and many UN agencies.


Now, if the Climate Change Movement really believed what they say about carbon dioxide, then you need to explain how an increasing atmospheric CO2 content can 1) decrease atmospheric temperature, 2) maintain a constant atmospheric temperature, and 3) increase atmospheric temperature.

1. What are your credentials? What makes you qualified to interpret insanely complicated data? People devote their whole lives after a 4 year undergrad to work on this but hey you got a gender studies degree? NBD.
2. Are you aware of milankovich cycles, methane hydrates, and the O18/16 cycle? If so, how does that factor into your understanding if all you look at is recorded human climate data since the 1800s?
3. Are we in a glaciation or a warming? Are you SURE?
4. To what degree does a molecule of CO2 contribute to climate change?


Show them data! Like:
1. O18 data (check wikipedia)
2. Glaciation data
3. Literally anything taken before recorded data (i.e., ice cores, fossil isotopes)
4. A site that ALSO has peer reviewed articles that isn't funded by climate change zealots (skepticalscience) like Nature, ScienceDirect, etc
5. British Columbia's supreme court case showing Michael Mann's infamous hockey stick graph which we all reference as inherently and deeply flawed and misleading.


APW is real. But at this point the lunacy is out of control. The science is not settled--far from it. But for the first time in history people who are completely unqualified are declaring the science settled. Scientists themselves don't even do this. We have a long way to go to understand how much we are affecting the climate. We ARE affecting it--but we don't know to what degree--which is something ya might want to know if you want to, say , tax people, or significantly reduce the quality of life of people in the western world to meet emissions targets that the two largest emitters on earth do not care one shred about.

Most of the warming is seen in regions near the arctic like in Russia and Canada, the urban areas aren't really affected too much except more natural disasters. Carbon dioxide does not solely affect climate, but it's definitely the main culprit of climate change right now. Volcanoes only release around 3% of the CO2 humans release each year, and it was already in the carbon cycle. Natural processes in general definitely does produce more carbon than humans, but this didn't change the environment because natural processes also absorb as much carbon as it released. We tipped this equilibrium by cutting down forests for farmland, and mining fossil fuels to use in machines and power plants. The evidence is clear as the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere continues to increase.

A one degree change throughout the ENTIRE WORLD when there are no major world events is a big deal, because it hints that humans are doing something that is warming the Earth. While there are events that have lowered world temperatures by 3-5 degrees, usually by a big volcanic eruption, yes, humans have survived them, but the disasters still caused mass famine and starvation. The 1 degree increase in global temperature is *very* unlikely to be caused by natural events, but rather that we are disrupting the carbon cycle by producing way too much carbon dioxide and simultaneously destroying areas that can re-absorb it. (in fact, the ocean ecosystems are extremely stressed by human activity, whether intentional or not. Garbage and pollution may be a localized problem at first, but the ocean currents take them all over the world.) If you're talking about history, of course there is no ""limit"" for carbon absorption, as in how much carbon the Earth could potentially absorb. However, the amount that we are releasing is definitely way over the limit as in ""how much carbon the planet could absorb from the mess we're making"" and since parts/million CO2 are continuing to rise on a global scale, this is evidence that we are past that limit.",UCsbtLQ_zl_eBbQ4IsL6yagQ,1.0,UgwEnfpajDO_0O7Bqrl4AaABAg,9M29ns1rUSE,2019-11-13T17:00:03Z,climate crisis

Saying ""human activity release of CO2 pales in comparison to natural release"" is only being ignorant. For one, not only are we pumping carbon into our atmospheres like crazy, we are also removing a large amount of natural carbon absorbers, which will certainly tip the balance, and while I am aware that local events and global temperature increase are different things, the thing is that the planet, on average, has shown a warming of about 1 degree celcius since 1950.

Health issues with CO2 comes from places with extremely high local production of CO2 (for example, in cities with unfiltered coal/oil plants) which many of the effects are also from other byproducts like Sulfur Dioxide and the like which produce strong acids when it reacts with water, causing acid rain. Similarly, the ozone layer has nothing to do with ozone in city smog, and on the topic of ozone, we had the governments do just about everything, banning CFCs and things with chemicals that do loads of harm to the ozone layer.

Name a scientific paper (peer-reviewed and not proven wrong yet) with clear evidence against the scientific fact that *global* climate change is caused by humans and or is not happening.

To name something which in your logic contradicts climate change is not enough as your logic is clearly flawed.

By the way you are trying to defend a narrative of climate deniers which no one in their right mind is trying to defend today (namely that climate change is not happening - this is just idiotic. Look at the globally averaged temperature records of any source; you have to be blind and brain dead to defend that temperatures are not globally raising).
The new narrative is that it is changing but not because of humans. There is equally good evidence that it is overwhelmingly caused by humans. But it is not so easy that you just look at one graph. Stupid but not so extremely stupid like the first narrative.

You don't believe in the total overthrow of capitalism but do believe in targeted use of socialism when useful. On the spectrum of socialism, social democrats are really liberal. In fact, many socialists openly voice disdain for social democrats. In the Third International,  Lenin and others in Marxist-Leninist vein basically condemned social democrats, using the term ""social fascist"". Again, the reason why they get so much hate is because they're not interested in the complete overthrow of capitalism. They don't get love from anarchists either. Ultimately, social democracy is not that radical (which could be good or bad depending on your perception).
In fact social democrats are the mainstream left in most of Western Europe.
Part of the reason why US liberals get seen as ""SJW shit"" is because the ""left"" in mainstream US politics is a bad joke dominated by neoliberals. Bernie or Warren would be a tepid social democrat in Europe or Latin America. Neolibs like to exploit identity politics (which do have some valid concerns) to distract from class consciousness, imo.
I think properly identifying your political tendency, and properly placing yourself relative to others on the political spectrum is important so you have a clear idea of what you actually want out of politics. You don't need to put yourself in a box, but realize that what you call yourself will affect other's perceptions and potentially distance you from those you agree with (or keep you from distancing yourself from those you disagree with!).
This is also why the term ""centrist"" provokes some doubt from me, I certainly don't like the term, because that can mean very different things depending on where you are and what the political climate is like.",UCturRGLgabxzzF_5cIlLmcg,1.0,UgyVhKxhaxvjqiKD-ld4AaABAg,9M29ns1rUSE,2019-11-13T17:00:03Z,climate crisis

(this is not my opinion, I am just playing devil's advocate)
Here is the argument: developing the technologies to become more environmentally friendly is expensive. That cost must be passed onto the customer. This makes a company selling that product not competitive with other companies selling the same product who do not invest in those technologies. 


Example: USA steel company smelts steel. They invest 1 billion dollars into a solar plant to power their smelters. this raises the cost of their steel from $1 per pound to $1.50 per pound. China steel company doesn't invest in green energy and just uses coal power plants to power their smelters. China steel company sells their steel for $1 per pound just like USA steel company did. When a customer comes and says ""I need 1000 pounds of steel"" they see that to buy from USA steel would be $1500.00 and to buy from China steel would be $1000.00 for the same product. The customer buys from China steel to save $500 and soon USA steel is out of business.",UCfIwbRlatk3Dd6Uld-s6XNg,1.0,UgxxvAw4FVqtLkAMt7B4AaABAg,9M29ns1rUSE,2019-11-13T17:00:03Z,climate crisis

No one went around the world interviewing every scientist to get their opinion. The consensus myth is the result of two very flawed studies. One was soliciting replies from a mailing list of around 3,000 people (most of whom were not climate scientists). 
In the other, the IPCC looked at an arbitrary sample of research papers to see who disagreed with their narrative. Those who disagreed were put in the disagree pile, those who agreed were put in the agree pile. And those who were silent on the IPCC's narrative (which made up more than 90% of studies) were arbitrarily added to the agree pile. This is an obvious and outrageous case of academic fraud.

According to the Vostok Ice Core Records, CO2 level changes have followed Earth's overall temperature changes at an 800 year lag for the last 800,000 years. That means that our current CO2 levels are the result of Earth's overall temperature 800 years ago, which coincides with the Medieval Warm Period (950-1250 CE). World leaders have convinced their dependents that this works in the reverse order, relatively quickly, and that we are to blame, so that they can tax us out of a false shared guilt in order to be able to afford to ""fight"" climate change, an unstoppable natural cycle. What we may need are commercial solutions that will aid in the survival of the human race throughout the coming centuries. The following is the source information for this comment:

Historical Carbon Dioxide Record from the Vostok Ice Core

Period of Record
417,160 - 2,342 years BP

Methods
In January 1998, the collaborative ice-drilling project between Russia, the United States, and France at the Russian Vostok station in East Antarctica yielded the deepest ice core ever recovered, reaching a depth of 3,623 m (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Ice cores are unique with their entrapped air inclusions enabling direct records of past changes in atmospheric trace-gas composition. Preliminary data indicate the Vostok ice-core record extends through four climate cycles, with ice slightly older than 400 kyr (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Because air bubbles do not close at the surface of the ice sheet but only near the firn-ice transition (that is, at ~90 m below the surface at Vostok), the air extracted from the ice is younger than the surrounding ice (Barnola et al. 1991). Using semiempirical models of densification applied to past Vostok climate conditions, Barnola et al. (1991) reported that the age difference between air and ice may be ~6000 years during the coldest periods instead of ~4000 years, as previously assumed. Ice samples were cut with a bandsaw in a cold room (at about -15°C) as close as possible to the center of the core in order to avoid surface contamination (Barnola et al. 1983). Gas extraction and measurements were performed with the ""Grenoble analytical setup,"" which involved crushing the ice sample (~40 g) under vacuum in a stainless-steel container without melting it, expanding the gas released during the crushing in a pre-evacuated sampling loop, and analyzing the CO2 concentrations by gas chromatography (Barnola et al. 1983). The analytical system, except for the stainless-steel container in which the ice was crushed, was calibrated for each ice sample measurement with a standard mixture of CO2 in nitrogen and oxygen. For further details on the experimental procedures and the dating of the successive ice layers at Vostok, see Barnola et al. (1987, 1991), Lorius et al. (1985), and Petit et al. (1999).

Trends
There is a close correlation between Antarctic temperature and atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (Barnola et al. 1987). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows that the main trends of CO2 are similar for each glacial cycle. Major transitions from the lowest to the highest values are associated with glacial-interglacial transitions. During these transitions, the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 rises from 180 to 280-300 ppmv (Petit et al. 1999). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows the present-day levels of CO2 are unprecedented during the past 420 kyr. Pre-industrial Holocene levels (~280 ppmv) are found during all interglacials, with the highest values (~300 ppmv) found approximately 323 kyr BP. When the Vostok ice core data were compared with other ice core data (Delmas et al. 1980; Neftel et al. 1982) for the past 30,000 - 40,000 years, good agreement was found between the records: all show low CO2 values [~200 parts per million by volume (ppmv)] during the Last Glacial Maximum and increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations associated with the glacial-Holocene transition. According to Barnola et al. (1991) and Petit et al. (1999) these measurements indicate that, at the beginning of the deglaciations, the CO2 increase either was in phase or lagged by less than ~1000 years with respect to the Antarctic temperature, whereas it clearly lagged behind the temperature at the onset of the glaciations.

In fact, don't reveal who you voted for or any thoughts that could be perceived as liberal. Also, show your vulnerability to the extreme. Think of the worse fears you have for life becoming extinct, don't be afraid to let it all out. A couple weeks ago I had a dream and the final image of this dream, and the only thing I remember was a lava-covered Earth. I don't know if that's how it would happen. But the fear from imagining that, of all life not continuing is what needs to be expressed as an emotional appeal. Thirdly give them your logical trump cards- better safe than sorry and what's the worse that could happen? These are thinking techniques we learn in elementary school and they should be very hard to logically riggle out of. We're currently becoming a hivemind of ideas and denial is nothing more than a thought virus in our planet-sized brain. It can't be illegal, so our only recourse is to use our thoughts and arguments and sap denial of its power. But what about good ideas? 
Well if you have like my thoughts this far you may be interested in a half-baked idea I have. It's basically just a social media/ investing website/ app idea. Circles in the middle will represent the points of no return according to climate science. Circles outside of this will represent the years left until the PONR. Vector arrows pointing in will represent investment and ideologies that are carbon positive or otherwise not environmentally friendly. Carbon neutral investments/ ideas will be represented as lines blocking the carbon positive arrows, or as I like to call them; doom arrows. You can probably guess what the arrows pointing out will represent, let's call them Earth Guards. We do need a good story, right? There is so much information when it comes to climate change and the world has been overflooded with information as it is. I think a simple data representation tool like this could funnel our money and social media compulsion to help us achieve something great, something to be proud of with all of our power and technology.

So if we implement a bunch of restrictions to our own economic power in the name of saving the planet but China or Russia (name any world power you want really) doesn't, then its basically the same as choosing to jog in a sprinting marathon. Which then leads to a spiral of becoming a weaker and weaker country and getting taken over by the countries who give even less of a shit about the environment than climate change deniers seem to.


I'd love it if everyone was willing to play nice together and agree to worldwide standards, but unless we have global cooperation on a very specific set of guidelines, we are very likely to become weaker and weaker economically while other countries grow stronger.   This is where the ideologies collide in my opinion. Half of our country cares only about saving the planet, and the other half only cares about preserving the power of our country. But for the world to become a better place overall, we need to work together on both of these things.

Why did they change it from global warming to climate change? Because they are covered no matter which way the climate goes, does that make sense if the science is settled and the climate is warming due to CO2?  Don't even get me started on scaring the kids into a frenzy so they worry all the time about extinction. That is a terrible thing to do to children and is actually abusive and selfish. I should also mention that a lot of those climate discussions with the kids demanded redistribution of wealth which is socialism/communism and has nothing to do with fighting climate change. And before they predict the weather for 100 years from know and we spend trillions can they start getting the forecast for 3 days from now at least close. Can you find the predictions from 15 years ago or ten years ago or 5 years ago no me neither that's because they were wrong every time the co2 effect is never what they thought so they have to hide the data.

Many forests are being cut down and purposefully set on fire to make room for livestock. According to BBC ""A major report on land use and climate change says the West's high consumption of meat and dairy produce is fueling global warming. They said that more people could be fed using less land if individuals cut down on eating meat.The document, prepared by 107 scientists for the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), says that if land is used more effectively, it can store more of the carbon emitted by humans.""


You mentioned that generations are going look back and wonder why we did nothing to prevent climate change from happening and I think the same will be when future generations ask ""why were we torturing, raping, enslaving, and murdering animals to survive?"" 


BTW, the nation's largest dairy distributor Dean's just filed bankruptcy yesterday. We are starting to make a change.  


One of the biggest arguments I get from people about going vegan is ""But I love cheese and bacon too much, I couldn't give it up."" It's not about being perfect, but making a difference. If there are only a few animal products from stopping you, keep those for awhile and ditch the rest. Slowly start eliminating them from your diet.


Some great documentaries that touch on this subject and made me go vegan are
Earthlings
Dominion (Free on Youtube)
Game Changers (Netflix)

He keeps referring to his position as a narrative (n: a spoken or written account of connected events; a story). Let's not create stories about climate change. Let's not attack the billionaires that buried the stories to save their pockets. Let's not try to pin the belief or denial on a group of individuals. Let's look at the data and the science behind it and determine through the scientific method who's to blame and what the facts are.


I do not deny that the climate is changing. I cannot deny that the world is getting warmer, the facts show it. I do, however, believe the cause is not squarely on the shoulders of mankind. I do not deny that we are terrible to our planet, but I also do not believe that our factories and CO2 emissions can have the effect that the climate change people say it is having. When a burp from a volcano belches out more CO2 in a single event than mankind and factories belch out over multiple years, I don't believe we're solely to blame. I like facts. 


For instance, out of all the greenhouse gasses in our atmosphere, only 3.62% is CO2. And out of that 3.62% of greenhouse gasses that are CO2, only 3.4% of that is caused by humans. (source: http://burtrutan.com/downloads/EngrCritiqueCAGW-v4o3.pdf)


Remember that correlation does not imply causation. The industrial revolution may coincide with our measurements of the climate change, but that could be because it was due to the technology that we got better at recording data. The world is getting hotter, by temperature readings across the planet. However, MANY of those temperature systems are built in cities and at airports; places paved and notorious for heat. With the bias for recording temperatures in developed areas, it skews our data. Especially when NASA reported in 2014 that the Antarctic sea ice reached a new record maximum. (source: https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/antarctic-sea-ice-reaches-new-record-maximum). 



How could the ice sheet reach a new record maximum if the planet is getting warmer due to human involvement in the middle of our climate catastrophe? because our readings are skewed by being taken where streets are paved and jet exhaust heats up the tarmac? I'll say it again: Correlation does not imply causation. I do not deny that the climate is changing, I do deny that we are the cause.


Finally, if humans are to blame for climate change, how come other planets are going through climate change as well? Mars is getting hotter, is our impact on earth affecting the weather on mars? (source: https://www.space.com/33001-mars-ice-age-ending-now.html).

In fact it is so complex, people (including climate scientists) cannot figure out what the hell is going on. To make a statement like ""extra co2 will lead to runaway greenhouse effect"" or ""the sunspot activity is showing a new ice age is coming"", based on the knowledge we have, is just guessing it with a lot of confidence.

I check the satalite global temperature charts every 2/3 weeks. The temperature has been declining for the last 2 years from the last heat spike in 2016. Most ""deniers"" think this will continue for another 3 to 6 years, then we will get a matching heat spike to the 2016 spike or maybe a bit lower. 

In this summer(2019), this declining was looking like it stopped and it was going up again. This continued for 3 months in sequence till a heat simular to 2015 (0,2 degree under 2016) was reached. At this time, I was actually worried I might be wrong and that ""the pause"" was actually true. But it turned out to be a mini-spike, and the temperature went down again to the level it was previously on. "" So, I'm still a denier. ""

This shows the tolerances we are working with, it is nitpicking with numbers. Decimal numbers of parts-per-million and temperature averages within a degree (all well within error margins).

The flat earthers have come up with an excuse for everything science has been doing for the last 400 years, with Copernicus, Galileo and Kepler(even Aristarchus of Samos and Pythagoras). They also maneuver around Newton and Einstein, and trying to explain it to them, how science really works is freaking exhaustive! And at the end, they turn out and refuse you, and go on in a continuous rampage spreading misinformation. In my country, astronomers and physicists took flat earthers to labs, observatories and other facilities, all on TV and they flat-refused (pun not intended), every experiment result with their own explanations, one explanation more baffling and absurd than the other. It seems they misuse Schopenhauer's 'The Art of Being Right' to always come up on top, they don't have any respect for Occam nor Popper, and they won't understand how 3D works, they see all as 2D, and are not even interested in learning the properties of the time-space continuum(which would require extra-thought, as it is actually ""4D""). When I started frantic searches for the origens of all of this, I found out it actually come from first world countries, and those guys here, are simply translating the dogmas into portuguese. Now you see... People educated and living in first world countries are coming up with those things, and spreading to in development economies or undeveloped ones. I and my parents worked hard to have me in university long ago, and since then, I haven't stopped with science, coz it is so freaking cool, and have always tried to get others in as well, but, if flat earthers are a reality in 2019, and an ever growing threat, something that in 2002, before getting my bachelor was unheard of(even within the confines of the internet), it seems we are in trouble my friends.... We have failed somewhere at sometime or some point, and I am exhausted of trying to fix it. I try to explain real science and people laugh at me... I just won't do it anymore! I will just sit down, sipping caipirinhas and margaritas and watch everything go mayhem. Lucky me, who was born infertile, I have no kids of my own to worry about their futures.

The interesting thing is, all I used for my researches and to better prepare myself for my students, was freely available scientific data and papers, and they all made perfect sense to me. Of course, one thing or another I had to refer to other articles or ask some friend, sometimes a senior colleague, to be able to make the full picture. I reproduced in lab a lot of stuff, I loved to do it with the attention of other people, like dissembling an old IGS and show how giros and accelerometers  work, plugging them to scopes and show how they sense motion and direction, and so on. Eventually the quality of the students started to drop dramatically and I was not fitting into the fold of being a public employee very well, got feed up, so I left for the private sector. If your mind is not trained in dealing with science, my friend, I don't blame you! 98% of my friends are not trained like that. There's no shame in that! But that fact, should be taken into consideration while you go on internet and make comments like you just did. It is not forbidden! It should never be! Free speech forever!!

Second, stop associating ""social justice"" with climate change. Even if they are related, people have already created a lot of antibodies against ""SJWs"" and anything related.

I also find it ironic most people like this are also usually against nuclear energy even though it's BY FAR the cleanest energy source and the only realistic way we can shake off our dependency on fossil fuels like France or Germany (with the assistance of great renewables of course like hydro or wind).  Also you can't propose people throw aside their views and follow ""scientific consensus"" when you refuse to throw aside your views and follow ""economic consensus"" on most of your economic views.  FYI among economists (who have worked closely with climate scientists) it's highly agreed upon that a Carbon Tax would go a long way to addressing the issue without destroying our economy or too badly hurting the poor in other countries; who frankly have much bigger problems to worry about right now like not dying from disease or malnutrition.  And speaking of it's insane to me you don't dedicate the same amount of time to resource depletion as you do to Global Warming when it's a FAR more important environmental issue.  And for the record, the great majority of Americans agree that Global Warming is real and has been accelerated by humans; the debate is over what / how much we should do to fight it.  So please stop talking down to those more pragmatic people like they don't understand.  Stop with the alarmism or nitpicked sources; just persuade them with solid simple objective data showing that spending money now to fight climate change is far more cost effective then spending it later trying to clean it up.

Kind of distracted from the message, which is that innate personality traits affect people's reaction to scientific facts. As a result, their experience is that simply telling the facts (as you ask) doesn't get people to accept and act on them.
Human minds are complex, and you can't neatly separate science from society and politics I'm afraid, especially when science predicts that society is acting on a self-destructive course but society believes will lose something by acting on the science.
It's like in the play by Henrik Ibsen, An Enemy of the People, we studied at school. Our teacher not only believed the protagonist was an idiot, but she sided with the town, even though they were scientifically and morally wrong!

Example, the rise of sea level will render parts of e.g. Florida, like the Keys, uninhabitable since the land will be under water. This will force people to move away from their homes which therefor goes against their right to live wherever they like.

2345,UgyWeYvSp_gVAEHdoLZ4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2019-11-24T03:54:13Z,Luís Miguel,"@Jerome Walton The topic started with the idea of banning meat because it was so bad for the environment. Your first premise was that we don't need to ban meat because scientists are researching better ways to feed the animals. I said that until they actually find that way then we should stop eating it as it doesn't make sense to continue promoting the dirty form of feed. You didn't actually present a counter-argument that follows that initial topic. Instead you moved the goal post and now said that you still wouldn't stop eating meat, even though you agree that better feed isn't in use yet and that the current one is bad, suggesting your position for continuing eating meat was never related to better feeding options. 

Anyway, so now the new argument is that meat is cheap, sustainable and healthy in moderation.

Cheap: I would say again, it's only cheap because of all the incentives and externalities which makes it only artificially cheap. Also all whole food (not processed) plant based protein is even cheaper than meat, so if cheap is an important criteria for you you should go with plant based protein sources. 

Sustainable: the United Nations IPCC, FAO and Oxford disagrees with you. Can you show some equally compelling or higher evidences that suggest the contrary? 

Healthy: in moderation anything can be discarded as not harmful. Depends on what degree of moderation. Anyway, plant foods are healthier as not only they are not associated with an increase of our biggest killers like heart disease, diabetes and some forms of cancer but they are even associated with a decrease or reversal of such problems. So if you are concerned about health you should be following a whole foods plant based diet as well. 

How does your understanding of what your body needs stops you from adopting plants as your primary source of protein? The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics which is the largest nutrition association in the world with more than 100.000 professionals has released a peer reviewed statement backed by 117 studies saying that a well planned vegan diet is not only ideal for all stages of life, including children, pregnancy, athletes, old age, etc, but it's even advantageous in regards to our biggest killer diseases. I hope you aren't presenting anecdotal evidences to counter hundreds of scientific studies... If you do have high order scientific studies to support you position please let me know. Also if you can see meats like impossible meat becoming your primary source just keep in mind that those are made from plants, so saying you won't adopt plant based protein sources because you understand how your body works but at the same time saying you could adopt impossible meat as your primary protein source is contradictory. 

Regarding the family of 5 in the food desert, is that the situation you are in? If it's not, then, again, you can't appeal to it in order justify not changing yourself. If it is, even in food deserts you can find canned beans, rice, potatoes and frozen vegetables cheaply. If you were in an area where nobody supplied those due to not being economically viable then that would also be the case for fast food and in that case you wouldn't really have anything to eat leaving no other choice than to move to another place.",UC6a3qRJKAK9HjGz045qqZ3w,1.0,UgyWeYvSp_gVAEHdoLZ4AaABAg,9M29ns1rUSE,2019-11-13T17:00:03Z,climate crisis

Because I don't hear about it much and lately the EPA has been using some weird numbers... Yes, I admit that in a video like this he wouldn't have been able to make an exhaustive list and touch on every single contributor. I just find it odd that if we consider that there are two major sources, both very bad environmentally speaking, with some reports even mentioning aprox 50/50 in terms of contribution, but then, one of the issues (energy) is very hard to solve, will involve immense changes in infrastructure, personal buying power and which will take a lot of time to achieve, and then the other (animal agriculture) would solve a massive ethical conundrum, would contribute to the improvement of the general health of the population and that basically everybody can start doing it this very evening, it seems to me that it would have so much of a larger impact to focus on the second one that it should be the main one every video should be talking about. I think we should attack every angle of this problem, but with only ~10 years to make a significant difference we should focus on the easiest and most impactful thing each one of us could do, and sadly I don't see myself having the money to buy an electric car any time soon, only to have to charge it using energy still generated in a dirty way.

If i had a way to check the accuracy of data and it showed that its actually the case i would change my opinion. I fundamentally believe in the right i have to change my opinion, if not there’s not much any critical thinking skills i have is doing for me or will do for in the future. However that would be the case if i was a climate expert, since i am not i have to rely on experts and aggregation of data by other parties to give me a degree of certainty in my opinions. The problem is that given the uncertainty of my own lack of not being an expert and the % chance of experts themselves being wrong for one reason or the other i could question their motives but then i would be left to be a cynic who just is against any and all ideas. I have to stop somewhere and given that my compass in things that i dont know is guided by other authorities i have to accept their view for now.  So to recapitulate the answer to the first question, since i have no way of arriving at that scenario you point out (not being an expert) i have to run the risk and believe in the statistical unlikelihood that the majority of scientific papers and knowledge aggregators are not intellectually dishonest. This comes with the constant risk of me being constantly duped by this large group.

For the second question, yes and it regards mostly the popularization of important philosophical and scientific ideas, such as nihilism, evolution, socialism ect. This is more a readjustment based on primary txt (but nevertheless a considerable shift in perspective). 

Third question. Yes, people will lie for financial gain, but that again goes both ways and using it as compass simply leaves us having no certainty any which way on any topic unless we dedicate our life to becoming an expert in it. Given that its a minus applied to both sides of any equation it still leaves preponderance of opinion as a guiding factor for me, and atm its with climate change.",UCQ_w9sjPTCyLEa1NxQ-bIpg,1.0,UgzkhCJw_V1Tp2nzQVh4AaABAg,9M29ns1rUSE,2019-11-13T17:00:03Z,climate crisis

Because swedes pay crazy amounts of taxes if you look at the raw numbers. But at the same time we get so many things for free.... free education, child care, dental, free common educational grants (for living expenses), healthcare, unemployment funding, retirement etc. When running down the numbers we realized that common 2nd class citizens actually had better lives in Sweden, and although their ""pocket money"" was less after wage than average 2nd class American. Swedes could actually spend them more casually without worrying about insurance costs, saving for ours kids education, retirement plans etc. (or just the worry about loosing our jobs... I will receive 80% of my pay for at least 9 months, after that it's down to roughly 50%, which is still enough for decent living), we also get 6 weeks paid vacation + extra paid because it's nice during vacation.

But politics would never tackle consumption due to how our economical system work. Even in a socialist country like Sweden (where I am from) the green party cannot tackle that question. The state gets a cashback of 25% of what every Swede consume (in the form of taxes).... making the national economy safe, stable and with a working well fare system... I mean, we could live differently, live in communities, share items over several households. Does every house need their own power tools? washing machine? lawnmower? home cinema etc? or could we share those items over several households and in common spaces? You could access the exact same luxury you are used to,  while greatly reduce our need of consumption, and therefore our footprint, and at the same time add a sense of belonging to the community we live in.

It's difficult to know what's clear just as when communicating with a habitual liar, some BS still gets through. You have me searching for truth as far as ""clear data"". Good job.

Incentive is easy to assume but motive, or success of such motive,  often can't be proved smoking gun style. Preponderance of evidence must be used. Follow the money can go either way whether we're talking about big oil or government taxing it's citizens. NOAA can be bought off as easily as Exxon can BS the public for $$. NASA is already a government agency. 

As far as your question about other nations.... That's a damn good question that put me into research mode. It's seems too conspiratorial for my taste that nations other than the U.S. and those involved in the Paris climate agreement would also partake in said conspiracy to alter past temperature records. It's been a long time since I was presented with such a challenge and I may have to relent on this particular point. Kudos. 

Your next two questions regard reliability and bias. Temperature stations are notoriously placed in locations that can be affected by unnatural factors ie. Heat island cities and at airports online of hot exhaust from jet engines. When satellite data are the only measures that we use, I'll have infinitely more hope in data accuracy though we still have to plow through the whole politics ordeal. Which is why I have some questions here for you.

If accurate satellite data were to prove that the Earth hasn't been warming, how difficult would you it be for you to accept the new findings? Can you simply say ""what a bunch of idiots. But at least we know better now?"" Maybe you would hold your convictions because satellite data could still be wrong due to new technology glitches, or because of popular opinion? Maybe you would then be considered a conspiracy theorist. Have you ever ""red pilled"" or become ""woke"" because you now realize you've been lied to your entire life about important shit.?

I actually think taxing can help mitigation! Tax the big carbon polluters and force them to start looking towards cleaner energy sources once coal becomes too costly. 

I learnt recently that OPEC - the oil cartel - didn't raise prices to sky high to max their profits in the past because they didn't want to push people to look for alternatives to oil. 

So I feel like price signals can be a very powerful tool to change behaviours, especially when you're forcing the dirty polluters to pay for the cost of damaging the environment (search negative externalities tax).

I think to reach the right, the left needs to focus on supporting research into alternative energies, mentioning that from a Biblical context God called His people to be caretakers of the Earth, and then not putting forth crazy pants ideas like the green new deal. You tell a right leaning person you want to do away with air travel, planes, and stuff like that, they aren't going to listen. Instead, talk about how you want to support alternative methods of travel, like beefing up our train travel opportunities by creating a better infrastructure and cheaper travel alternatives. If I could travel by train to Florida from West Virginia (where I live), I would rather do that, but it costs nearly the same. Talk to us about supporting meat alternatives and making those things like The Impossible Burger to be comparatively delicious and maybe even cheaper than beef... That would get my attention!!! Basically, I believe that through enhancement in technology, we will solve many of our energy and environmental issues. If we were able to achieve cold fusion, I think much of the arguments would be moot. We could have a good conversation about how to really cut back on fossil fuels because the energy would still be there. I have many conservative friends who believe the left just wants to send us back to the dark ages, and you talk about being afraid, that scares conservatives. Along with that, when you make humans out to be a virus or always the bad guy of the environment, it turns us off.

From a certain economic point of view, climate change is not best solved by government intervention. It's not (necessarily) that they genuinely disbelieve in science, but that they distrust the effects of large government action. The primary focus is the inefficiency of bureaucracies.
So, one has to imagine a scenario where an individualistic, market-driven solution to climate change is presented. A general problem with this is that alternative energy sources are usually less efficient. This is where I introduce the topic of nuclear energy.

In a way, my strongest argument when faced with someone of a more right-leaning political orientation is the my belief that public perception of nuclear energy harms economic growth, which is of course common ground with individualistic, market-oriented thinkers. If you don't agree with me on the question of nuclear power, there are similar issues, such as hydro-electric dams. These dams suffer the same public perception issues, and thus government regulation issues, as nuclear power, and serve as an effective tool to combat climate change.

That's NASA's Gavin Schmidt's words, by the way, not mine. One of the few things I agree with him on.


The problem with calling it a scientific theory is that you're implying it's been left unfalsified through experiment; in reality it's not even a hypothesis as that would mean scientists are attempting to test it, and... well, it's not really possible to test such a thing in OUR atmosphere and the other planets we've seen are more or less stabilized at this point. So all we really have to work with are computer models, and they are frankly quite laughable. I'm not surprised, given that like I said, it's not possible to test it using our atmosphere. Too many confounding variables, like urban heat islands, natural cycles, jet streams, oceans, plant life, cloud cover, other gases, evaporation, precipitation...

I like to say there's this little dude in your head that has no self confidence and is incredibly skeptical. If you so much as try to tell him a fact he immediately clings harder to his already held beliefs. Why? This dude has no confidence and will do anything to not appear dumb or uninformed.


That's why I love videos like this or what Greta and other protesters are doing. They're confronting the issue without actually confronting people on a 1-to-1 basis. You see, when the little self conscious skeptic watches these videos or sees protesters he's free to change his mind or question his beliefs without being embarrassed. 


So I definitely say, don't engage & don't debate. Especially because many climate change deniers are arguing in bad faith. They have no intention of changing their mind. You can give them fact, after fact, after fact. They'll just cherry pick a certain quote or you'll end up going around in circles. 


Use emotion and make it personal. Tell stories like this one. 


The biggest reason I say don't engage though is that it takes a freaking long amount of time. That little dude in your head, he's also a jumpy little dude. There's a good reason why you're not curled up in a ball right now thinking about the fact that as you read this, someone probably died horribly. Our brains don't like being overwhelmed with terror and fear. We're very good at shutting it out. If you go gloom and doom on these guys they will run. If you overload them with info, they'll run.

 You always hear ""we only have X number of years until it's too late!"" citing studies after studies. Then the timeline comes, nothing happens and new studies come out saying ""No it's really this Date! were serious this time!"".  This has happened so many times it discredits the science in most of my peer's eyes.

Secondly, while most scientists agree that we are affecting climate change, they don't universally agree on what the actual effect of this would be. Why spend trillions upon trillions of dolors when the consequence might be mute. Sure this guy here says this will happen, but this guy here says that will happen.

Thirdly, the solution is economics. Big oil will fight if you try to kill it. But if you offer an alternative that is also profitable and is a viable solution then it will work. 

NUCLEAR POWER It is literally the solution to everything but the media feer mongers it to death. There is enough uranium on earth to power the entire human population for the next ten million years with 0 carbon emissions. But no one wants it. Modern reactors do not explode like Chernobyl. and the waist can now be turned into glass, meaning easier to store and 0% possibility of ground contamination.

Solar is horrible, it has a 1 to 1 ratio of product to waste in manufacturing and relies entirely on batteries which are about the worse thing for our environment to make.

Wind Is also horrible due to its reliance on batteries and its mass slaughter of birds.

Hydro is great except its not available everywhere and it destroys ecosystems.

The solution is simple and available today but no one wants it. nuclear power. People don't want it, so there is no money to be made in providing it.

In terms of Climate Change science, even scientists are vulnerable to this. If someone comes up to you with information that essentially invalidates all your life's work and every degree you've handed out as a professor, you tend to reject it out right even if that information is solid and grounded in facts. The biggest problem with consensus science is that it  makes it possible for vast number of scientists to fall victim to the same underlying flaws of that consensus, while simultaneously giving the hypothesis as a whole a sense of truth without actually being true. 'All these scientists say it's true, so it must be.' right? This isn't logistical thinking at all. History proves that it only takes one person to get something right, and it is often the majority who find themselves on the side of denial. This is why Galileo had such a hard time convincing everyone the world was round and not flat despite him having all the evidence he needed in his notes and in the view of his telescope. They had a consensus that they refused to let go of until the evidence was just to overwhelming. 
This time we find ourselves in that same situation, only now it's about how climate changes. That facts are that we do need to regulate emissions and clean the environment. The facts are also that consensus scientists have fallen victim to a fatal flaw in their work that effectively makes every paper, book, study, and model void and invalid because they all share the same foundation. There is more on this here if you want to better understand our climate and the situation we really face as a species:

Heat radiates from the sun, which warms the earth. both CO2 and the Earth's surface reflect that radiation back into space, absorbing a little bit whenever it reflects, which we feel as heat. If you imagine the sun's radiation as 100 rays of light at 100% power, and every time they reflect they lose one tenth their power (really simplifying it here), if we had no CO2 in the atmosphere it'd reflect all off the surface once and we'd absorb 10% of the radiation of all 100 rays and as heat and the other 90% of all 100 rays would bounce back into space. If the earth was half covered in CO2, 50 rays would bounce back into space immediately and the other 50 would bounce back off the surface. The heating comes because of the 50 that hit the earth, only 25 will bounce back into space, the other 25 will hit the CO2 again, bouncing back to earth, then 12.5 into space and 12.5 on the CO2, etc., and by the end both the surface and the CO2 have absorbed much of the ray's energy because they keep bouncing back and forth trapped within our atmosphere. It's like that old brick breaker game, if you trap the ball between layers of bricks, you destroy a lot more, except instead of bricks it's CO2 and the Surface and instead of the ball it's radiation.

If you maybe said something wrong, it's that if half the Earth was covered by CO2, then it would likely still reflect the same amount of light in the first step, it would just hold on to the heat better.

With regard to the 75% figure this was regarding their ideal electrical generation. Meaning that wind farms buil offshore in the UK in the 90's are still in operation now and still generating decent amounts of power. Comments on that?

Solar loses ver little of its generation per year. It can lose between 0.2 percent to 1% of its initial power per year dependant on where its installed.

I looked at a bunch of studies and that study was the most Conservative there was. Like I said. The lifespan is effected by a range of variables such as weather, size of wind farms, size of turbine, lightning strikes, maintenance programmes.  Most of the UK's wind turbines installed in the 90's are still in operation with 75% efficency of the day 1 installation power. They are expected to still be in operation for at least another 5 years. I won't reference my source. Oh wait (in my own power, 2019). Therefore you were not wrong stating they can have a shelf life of 15 years however that is the most Conservative lifespan that I have read about. Their lifespan can be from 15-30 years. With regard to solar modern day solar have a shelf life of at least 20-25 years (under my own power, 2019). You state that uni students can do an assignment without continual harvard referencing throughout their assignments. I need to get in contact with my old uni tutors!

It's harder to deny that your Grandpa had a farm on the river and now every other year it is filled with water to the point you have to ask for money from the federal government.  Pointing out that a higher levee isn't actually helping because the river just goes higher the next year is a pretty obvious thing. That said I grew up 10 miles from the Mississippi river it's a lot easier to convince people affected than the guy in an office building in  NYC!,UCpdjMYrVAwqQ-t1WEu3R4pA,0.0,Ugx1bmXBcAViUzPU7Ct4AaABAg,9M29ns1rUSE,2019-11-13T17:00:03Z,climate crisis

My major climate denier has spent 30+ years working on finding and tapping oil fields safely. I will never convince him that climate is real because his job is part of him right now and it would hurt his self image to think that what he did had a bad impact on the world.

-The Planet will always be fine, many mass extinction events are linked to volcanic eruptions or other events that completely messed with the atmosphere/oceans. Life recovers as always, just not in the form that existed (well for the most part, some species do survive). So ""Save the planet"" is meaningless in my eyes as these events will happen over and over again regardless of our actions, perhaps we can divert an asteroid, but we can't do anything about the killing potential of our planet's active core. The catchphrase should be ""Save our asses"", now THAT compels me.
-About that relevant catchphrase, I also think humanity naturaly progresses towards self-preservation and more ecological ways of living. Advanced societies do it the most, so 1st world countries are to blame the least, while developing countries do the most damage. We'll still go through a period of a couple hundred years where China and India will cause the vast majority of polution and after them African and other growing Asian countries will jump on the mass polution train as they transition into advanced societies where priorities shift from survival and growth at all costs into being able (economically free enough) to be mindful of the environment.

They even have articles (pseudo-scientific articles) to ""prove"" their point. The only way to convince those people, imo, is to demonstrate them, one data point at a time, how their source of information twists the facts or hides important informations. Those peope are like you and me: they don't like being lied to.
It's generally a long work, not fun to do, and sometimes you have to work hard on yourself not to loose your temper when they start calling you names or acting smug.

Also, we definitively need to learn how to have an epistemic interview. Have a look at the work of Anthony Magnabosco. Listen, ask questions, let them take their time to think. Most of times, your goal shouldn't be to convince people, but just to shatter a bit their beliefs, bring them a bit of doubt and the tools to start rethinking their point of view. And then, let them do the rest of the work themselves. And try to be nice. Don't start this if you won't be to able stay nice, calm and patient.

Oh, and never start that kind of conversation in public. One to one ""debate"" is better, because nobody will feel judged by others, you won't feel the need to show the ""audience"" that you're right.

 We can't directly approach the issue without causing people to dig deeper into their trenches.  But time and information will weather them slowly into a better understanding of the truth.

You have to understand where they're coming from. The whole climate topic for whatever reason has been intertwined with the political debate.
 Scepticism stops being the credo of science once it to comes to climate change. Now obviously scepticism doesnt mean blindly rejecting scientific consensus but I'd argue blindly believing it is just as unscientific.

Their way of thinking will soon be obsolete. What matters is to have a majority that does understand the implications of climate change and are ready to make it the main part of their voting decisions and make efforts to change the society for the better!
As, Kropotkine said in the Spirit of Revolt:
""The need for a new way of life becomes apparent. The traditional code of morals, which governs most people in their daily life, no longer seems sufficient. What formerly seemed 'just' is now felt to be a crying injustice. Yesterday's morality is recognised today as revolting immorality...""
And that's the point. The morals of Climate Deniers is based, as you pointed out, on individualism, profit above all, uncontrolled free market and thus, uncontrolled exploitation of resources, continuous growth... Yes, it's the capitalistic values, and those values are failing us, we realise more and more how unsustainable they are! We need a new set of values and morality. Values of collaboration, resilience, care, regeneration... I do not want to pretend that fighting climate change can be done with this old set of values and morality! In the buzzwords you showed to convince republicans there are ""Energy Freedom, Competition, National Security..."". Those aren't good values. They are opposite to a world of collaboration between countries and individuals, and using them won't fix climate change, it won't solve the deeper causes of it, and at best, will just postpone some its consequences...
We have a great chance today of entering a new era for humanity, and more and more people are convinced of that. People are ready to relinquish their ego, to fight for a real political life, where politic is at the hand of citizens and isn't just statecraft as it is now, the privileges of some is viewed as immoral more and more, people want a true Climate, Ecological and Social Justice to finally happen. That is to add to the universal declaration of human's rights something like ""Everybody, everywhere and everywhen, have the same right to access the natural wealth""!

There was no regulation requiring them to be more efficient. They did it to appeal to environmentally conscious consumers, while not actually putting in any effort to make them efficient. All of that is way off base from the point I was making with that example, which is that ""fuel efficiency"" does not equal ""saving money"" which does not equal ""polluting less."" Please try to keep your points more directly relevant to the argument.


""history has shown that corporations are fine with their brand being associated with trash, and that consumers love staying in places that are full of trash."" That's a pretty big misinterpretation of what I said. What I said was that companies have repeatedly polluted people's communities, and the environments they live in. That is a fact. Your point once again seems to be that companies are dissuaded from polluting because it would make them look bad or consumers wouldn't like what they're being subjected to. Companies have been pumping CO2 into the atmosphere for decades and neither of these things have stopped them in the slightest. I don't care if you think that it ""should"" stop them in a ""free market."" It hasn't and it never will.


I did look at individuals. That's what's meant by ""per capita."" The US is 17th out of 195 countries. 3 below Australia.


In my curiosity reading about your claim about converting to the metric system, I learned that despite the initial cost, the long term benefits and savings are actually enormous and would eventually outweigh the cost. Isn't that a funny little parallel? Your comparison and the problems you mention imply an ""all or nothing"" switch, like companies would not slowly, progressively adopt more renewables, at different rates.


You're concerned about the costs of converting to renewables being higher with a carbon tax. I'm no expert but if the cost is really that significant you could probably just offset it with subsidies. Or, just not apply the tax to carbon used for that work.


Expecting a unicorn like Tesla to come and revolutionize every industry is not going to save the world. It also neglects areas where consumers don't have any choice. I don't choose my energy company. It also neglects that the vast majority of consumers simply do not care and will not choose a product just because it pollutes less.


""there is no inherent advantage for a business to produce a waste product."" Yes. There is. It's cheaper. It's cheaper to pollute. It's cheaper to not care what happens to the people. It's cheaper to not care what happens to the environment. It will always be cheaper until it eventually destroys them in the long run.

Asperger syndrome makes interacting with people a chore. did you know that america has repeatedly tried to go to the metric system? funny enough, it would cost an exorbitant amount of money just to change a few ones and zeros, and paint over a few signs. imagine trying to switch to an entirely different energy source. especially if all the materials for that energy source require, for example, steel to power. if companies were trying to make the switch without the carbon tax that would be difficult, but when the price of the new fuel gets higher due to the same taxes, not to mention scarcity, you will probably cause a lot of bankruptcy. alternatively, if you have new businesses (cough tesla cough) that market themselves explicitly off of the fact that they use renewable energies, then people who care about that fact will probably choose to buy from those businesses more. there is no inherent advantage for a business to produce a waste product, and nobody likes to see the waste product either. this should be a pretty simple concept, in free markets you get more say as a consumer. if you don't like something you don't need to buy it, you can go somewhere else. if you can't find what you want, just make a business and see if others like what you have.",UC5xeTJrQZ7MAHEwqWicwakA,1.0,UgybBHOqy5vJZojaeM94AaABAg,9M29ns1rUSE,2019-11-13T17:00:03Z,climate crisis

Your point seems to be that companies are already incentivized to pollute less, because improving fuel efficiency would save them money. And that is just not universally true at all. For example, the Volkswagen scandal. Why would Volkswagen lie about how fuel efficient their cars were if it would have apparently been more profitable to just make them that fuel efficient in the first place? Your other point is that companies are also incentivized not to pollute because people don't want to live in polluted neighborhoods. Reality has shown repeatedly that companies do not care and will do it anyway. At least until they have a lawsuit on their hands. I'm not sure how to interpret your point about the government or how they apparently created the problem.


Heritage is a conservative think tank that is heavily biased to the right. Even assuming I trust their numbers, which I don't, the top 10 countries listed there have 0 correlation with the top 10 cleanest countries. In fact, many of those top 10 can be found high up in the emissions per capita rankings (Australia is number 14).


Ah I think I was confused. You meant the prices companies charge are influenced by market prices, materials, taxes, etc. so they don't ""choose"" them. I thought you meant they literally couldn't choose them and were regulated by a third party in some way.


In your list of ways that companies could cut costs or compensate under a carbon tax you neglected to mention the explicit purpose of the tax: moving to more renewable resources. The more energy a company produces with renewables instead of fossil fuels, the more money they save under a carbon tax. Or, and this ties back into the efficiency thing, they could invest in finding ways to burn less fuel for the same energy output. Now, could/would companies also cut corners or costs in ways that don't emit less carbon like you say? I'm absolutely sure they would. But, just like you pointed out, doing these makes them less competitive. Therefore, the best way to stay competitive under a carbon tax, is simply to emit less carbon, through renewables or otherwise.

I'd like to address your first 2 non-concerns with some facts: https://skepticalscience.com/antarctica-gaining-ice.htm https://skepticalscience.com/polar-bears-global-warming.htm

I'd also like to address your statement that advancements in technology will fix the climate crisis on their own. And what I'm going to say might shock you: I partially agree. I agree that we have brilliant scientists all over the world working on a solution to the problems at hand. However, governments need to take action to, firstly, support these new technologies and their development (financially and otherwise), and secondly, to promote and in some cases subsidize them to get off the ground and to consumers. And right now we're in the tricky situation that oil companies fund a huge portion of political campaigns. This is what causes corruption. This is why, as you say, politicians don't care about climate change. And this is where I disagree. I believe that many individuals care about climate change on a personal level, but aren't willing to do the work that is needed to combat it. And what is needed is government reform. It needs to be taken out of the hands of the individual. This is too important to allow people the choice of ignoring it.

Finally, to address the concerns of what other countries are doing: lead by example. I am certainly no expert on international environmental regulations, nor do I wish to be, and I have no reason to believe that India, China and the like are following any sort of protocol on environmental reform, but what I do know is that, for better or for worse, the rest of the planet looks to the USA as an example (said as a bitter Canadian who's media coverage is basically 99% American). It's time to be good parents to our planet and step up and make meaningful change. It's going to suck. Nearly everyone will be inconvenienced at least and (temporarily) lose their jobs and need re-training at worst, but something needs to be done. Like you said, advancements in technologies will fix the issues.

Heat radiates from the sun, which warms the earth. both CO2 and the Earth's surface reflect that radiation back into space, absorbing a little bit whenever it reflects, which we feel as heat. If you imagine the sun's radiation as 100 rays of light at 100% power, and every time they reflect they lose one tenth their power (really simplifying it here), if we had no CO2 in the atmosphere it'd reflect all off the surface once and we'd absorb 10% of the radiation of all 100 rays and as heat and the other 90% of all 100 rays would bounce back into space. If the earth was half covered in CO2, 50 rays would bounce back into space immediately and the other 50 would bounce back off the surface. The heating comes because of the 50 that hit the earth, only 25 will bounce back into space, the other 25 will hit the CO2 again, bouncing back to earth, then 12.5 into space and 12.5 on the CO2, etc., and by the end both the surface and the CO2 have absorbed much of the ray's energy because they keep bouncing back and forth trapped within our atmosphere. It's like that old brick breaker game, if you trap the ball between layers of bricks, you destroy a lot more, except instead of bricks it's CO2 and the Surface and instead of the ball it's radiation.
2. You're right, insects do produce more than all cars combined, however, the amount of carbon which is reabsorbed into the carbon cycle has been regulated by eons of natural processes, and the amount output by all insects, animals, etc. has been matched by the earth reabsorbing it; humans have output more than the earth can reabsorb, i.e. if all animals output 750 gigatons of CO2, and the earth absorbed 750 gigatons, it maintains balance, but imagine humans then output an additional 25 gigatons, not there's more than the earth can handle, and there's the crisis.
3. It has, but even if it hadn't such a short time period wouldn't paint the bigger picture, which is we've had an uptick of global temperature increases since the industrial revolution.
4. Because it's easier that way to explain to laymen and policy makers one single temperature than hundreds of individual climates. The medium temperature is a shorthand.
5. Because the overwhelming scientific consensus supports the existence of human-influenced climate change, so why would we continue to support work which is demonstrably wrong?
6. The earth naturally goes through cycles of heating and cooling. we are currently on a uptrend towards heating, as predicted from ancient records, but we're at higher temperatures than expected.
7. We'd die... what is this question no one's saying to get rid of CO2???
8. Refer to no.1, as well, the sun is a giant ball of electrically-charged hot gas, and since they move around in a plasma, they go through a natural 11year cycle of switching the northern and southern magnetic poles (like that video of the astronaut spinning a t-handle in zero gravity, it flips back and forth). During these flips, solar activity increases. When it's not flipping, it's comparatively less active.
9. They don't, though. Volcanic eruptions in a year can produce up to 300million tonnes of CO2, but fossil fuel emissions produce somewhere around 20BILLION tonnes of CO2. Volcanoes *can* have a greater effect, though this is because of the aerosols released into the air which trap radiation (see no.1)

The whole basis of science is making a hypothesis, testing it, and determining whether or not it is correct. Ofc some things are going to be wrong and then corrected. There's this thing called the Scientific Method, you should check it out.

And in no way do climate change believers think we're all going to die (unless we don't do anything about it). Literally science is all about being wrong, and then correcting itself. Science has only one reality. By coming up with a theory, but then that theory being proven wrong, we are coming closer to knowing what that reality is. Did they not teach you this in school? 

So basically you just don't understand what science is. Surely you were wrong at one point in your life, and then corrected yourself into believing the right thing?

Climate change is real. But man-made climate change is causing global warming which will lead to an early ice age which is now causing the polar ice caps to melt at a rate never seen before (which is irreparable once they are gone), Luckily global warming is also causing them to refreeze at a rate never seen before. 

If it was ""settled science"" it wouldn't resemble the ramblings of a schizophrenic. Pick a narrative and stick with it, instead of ""finding out the predictions where wrong and then creating a new model and pretending the previous failure never happened."" 

It reminds me of all those doomsday cults who thought their messiah was coming and sold their houses.

But see, CO2's ability to capture infrared radiation and keep it inside the atmosphere is part of why we don't freeze to death every night (since the sun isn't facing that side of the earth), along with other greenhouse gases. But because humans are pumping out more and more CO2 (https://climate.nasa.gov/climate_resources/24/graphic-the-relentless-rise-of-carbon-dioxide/), the effect is becoming greater and greater, and because the temperature is rising, it's causing ice caps to melt (which is bad because ice, being white, reflects infrared radiation), and more water is evaporating (also bad because water vapor, like CO2, is a greenhouse gas). It's a huge chain reaction is why it's so scary. Do we have only 10 years before we all die? No, thats fearmongering. But is the threat still there? Yes.

Just look up the money flow through fossil industry into ""climate denier foundations"". No one with their right mind can see this much money flowing and think that the other side is the one influenced by money.

And a few years ago the deniers claimed that temperatures and sea levels are not rising. All a hoax in their mind. Now the message they are trying to convey is, that the science is not definite or that it is natural and not caused by humans. *This shift in messaging is not strange to you at all?*

*To me money tells you not what's right. Science is.* 
You can see from the flow of money that someone is maybe influenced. But this doesn't make him wrong. *But if you want to play the money game. Play it right.* There is no logic and no evidence behind what you are saying. Money is overwhelming spend on the climate-denier-side.

We found a 25% increase over 200 or so years. Then we check the correlation between the CO2 and common weather phenomena, namely temperature, which lines up pretty well.


Next, correlation =/= causation, yes. That's why we delve deeper and see if this is causation or not. At this point, the goal is to attribute or disprove the effect of CO2 on temperature. We can do controlled studies on ocean acidification with carbonic acid levels. The higher the temperature FROM CO2, the higher carbonic acid levels in the ocean, which is what we find. This ocean acidification is also demonstrated by the loss of coral reefs around the world.

Cosmic rays cause more cloud cover and more storms. Solar winds react with quartz in the mantle waking the volcanos. Large Earthquakes are connected  to solar activity. But regarding mans contribution, the earth has its own greenhouse gas ""detergent"" it has adapted and is self sustaining. It halves the life span of methane and other gases. But we still need to change our ways, not disagreeing with that. 
Also the airports around the world had to adjust their details for every landing strip/runway due to the tile of the earth slightly moving. This has caused the amplitude of the jet/polar streams to increase. So you get more polar weather to the equator and more equatorial weather to the poles. You also get standing waves so sometimes a storm will hover over one area instead of continuing in its course. This brings all the flooding. 

So basically there's a ton of shit they don't take into account. It all gets blamed on ppl.

There are many many many examples of life gone extinct due to (well in your world I guess mistakes from god?) experimentation of life. If a mutation is beneficial to a lifeform it will thrive, sometimes its neither and if it's detrimental (enough) it'll go extinct. So yes it seems like there is intelligent design behind it but most likely it's simply trial and error. Since the errors are extinct and in most cases no longer even visible as fossils they handily can be ignored by your intelligent design fiction cuz look at the tremendous odds that were in place to let us get to where we are! can't be luck right?

Unless of course that heat doesnt go to space because CO2 along with other greenhouse gasses prevents that by reflecting it back to earth, thus heating it up.

No about your reply, and to copy you, you are so wrong. Not all life needs oxygen, there's plenty life that instead of oxygen metabolizes for instance hydrogen or methane.

So let's re-examine that, End of conversation right there brother, shall we? *examines* --> nope, not over yet. I really would lke to understand why you refuse to read what is being said.. Firstly: Nobody has disagreed that it's been way higher at other times. So why do you keep reusing that argument and against what?  Secondly: Why is it so hard to accept there's a correlation between rapid climate change (whatever the cause, meteorite, CO2, whatever) and events that are not so good for the majority of life. i.e. a mass extinction event.
I do see a certain correlation between: 'Projected Profit for The Economy' and 'Ignoring Climate Change' short term it appears that the better you are at ignoring or undermining climate change the easier it is to make a profit cuz who needs those pesky enviro protections and s*** regulations. 
Long term alas there seems to be a consensus in 95% of the scientific world that it WILL have a severe impact and left to it's own devices corporate ignorance or negligence will cost them dearly if the do not work to change our direction.

After so many years, Sr Sasagawa of Akita, (approved vision of Our Lady of Akita) has received a NEW MESSAGE from her guardian angel on October 6, 2019: WARNS— “We MUST PUT ON ASHES”…reference to Jonas 3: 1-10 We must PUT ON ‘ASHES’ and say a Rosary of repentance/penance every day. I’ve added the new message plus an explanation to this page of Our Lady of Akita here, scroll down to see the new message:!!! UPDATE – October 6, 2019 – NEW MESSAGE recently given to Sr. Sasagawa by her Angel. – a private message was given to her, then she was told to tell everyone “Put on ashes and pray for a repentant rosary every day. (i.e say a Rosary for repentance/penance) You (Sr. Agnes) must become like a child and make sacrifices every day.” (Source: EWTN CATHOLIC RADIO)Re- ‘ashes’: the site that has reported this in Japan has noted that the first Mass reading that occurred two days later on October 8, 2019, was from the book of Jonas 3: 1-10 where the prophet was sent to warn the city of Nineveh that it was about to be destroyed by God because of the grave sins of its populace. The King and people repented, however, and putting on sackcloth and sitting in ashes, they and all their animals fasted and did penance. They appeased the wrath of God and He withheld the destruction of the city. Since we are getting a warning about ‘ashes’ from the Angel after so many years of silence at Akita, it is obvious this is a warning the chastisements are getting very close. Of note, this message came on October 6, the day the ‘Pachamama’ demonic idol was worshiped in St. Peter’s Basilica. We are getting another warning to step up our penances and repent if we wish to appease the wrath of God and withhold the foretold destruction for a little while longer.Akita: The THIRD APPARITION – THE CHASTISEMENTS TO COMEOctober 13, 1973Our Lady: “My dear daughter, listen well to what I have to say to you. You will inform your superior.”After a short silence: “As I told you if men do not repent and better themselves, the Father will inflict a terrible punishment on all humanity. It will be a punishment greater than the deluge, such as one will never have seen before. Fire will fall from the sky and will wipe out a great part of humanity, the good as well as the bad, sparing neither priests nor faithful. The survivors will find themselves so desolate that they will envy the dead. The only arms which will remain for you will be the Rosary and the Sign left by My Son.https://mysticpost.com/2019/11/news-after-so-many-years-sr-sasagawa-of-akita-approved-vision-of-our-lady-of-akita-has-received-a-new-message-from-her-gaurdian-angel-on-october-6-2019-warns-we-must-put-on-ashes-refe/(NOTE: This is in accordance with other mystics that say the Three Days of Darkness will actually be catastrophic fire falling from the sky.) > http://wqphradio.org/2019/10/27/a-new-message-from-sister-agnes-of-our-lady-of-akita/",UCEOQr_sxNRZsdUAF_wHX7kQ,1.0,UgyCNzQgnmt0nAidJ2t4AaABAg,9M29ns1rUSE,2019-11-13T17:00:03Z,climate crisis

Yeah commenting this a hundred times on different comments won't make it true lmao. You're right that CO2 increase would lead to higher agricultural yield and plant growth IN CONTROLLED CONDITIONS. IE. controlled scientific studies. But when factors like decreased water availability from higher CO2 induced temperatures (even by a few percentage points, still significant for ecosystems) and increased water retention rates leading to lower transpiration rates, the theoretical increase in growth is more than negated. Scientists in the Amazon have noted lower amounts of rainfall by about 5% because of decreased transpiration, which they attributed to slightly lower water supply, in which looking at isolated air samples, found that CO2 increased the temperature by a few percents.

There was a paper published in Feb 2018 in The Journal of Geology about extraordinary biomass burning around 10,800 BCE. It is fascinating.

Adjusted quote: ""Around 10,800 BCE, likely within the span of 21 years between 10,818 BCE and 10,797 BCE, ∼9% of Earth's terrestrial biomass, on ∼10 million km2 (area as big as the US), burned. The concentrations of soot, used to estimate the global amount of biomass burned, suggest that wildfires around 10,800 BCE consumed considerably more biomass than during the K-Pg extinction event.""

If interested the links are https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/695703?journalCode=jg for part 1 and https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/695704 for part 2. 

It would be interesting to calculate how much CO2 must have been released when ∼9% of world terrestrial biomass on ∼10 million km2 burned. The wildfires on 70,000 km² in Australia this year are estimated to release about 900 million tons of CO2, which equals to double the country's total yearly fossil fuel emissions.""

Perhaps CO2 released by burning of ∼9% of Earth's terrestrial biomass, on ∼10 million km2 might have contributed to melting of Cordilleran and Laurentide ice sheets? At present CO2 melts ice in Arctic, Greenlad, Antarctica so we can assume it should have been melting ice also around 10,800 BCE as well. 

There is a puzzling energy paradox. Melting of ice sheets happened during very cold period, so it should not have happened.

What mechanisms or combination of might have caused rapid melting of several kilometres thick ice sheets?

One simple physics principle is that the weight of several millions cubic kilometres of ice pushes the continent down. Heavy ice depresses the surface, at times pushing it below sea level, making the ice sheets to get in contact with warmer ocean, causing the ice sheets to retreat and stabilizing the system. Destabilize the system enough with a powerful external factor and things start moving quickly. 

Recent scientific papers start to provide more and more evidence that an external fast acting factor was in effect around 10,800 BCE. 

The paper published in March 2020 in Nature provides evidence of cosmic impact at Syria, coeval with impacts that deposited high-temperature meltglass, melted microspherules, and/or platinum at >50 sites on four continents around 10,800 BCE. Link to the article https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-60867-w

Impact on several kilometres thick ice sheet in Canada would not have left a permanent crater imprinted in the ground but more likely a depression filled with water which today would be in the form of a lake. 

There are several candidates for comet fragments impacts on ice sheet in Canada around 10,800 BCE. One of them possibly in Great Lakes area, perhaps the Saginaw Bay, Michigan // Lake Nippon // Manicouagan Reservoir // Gulf of Saint Lawrence // 

It is suggested it started in direction from Western coast to Eastern coast. 

It would be interesting to check the known impact craters in the world for a possible ""string impacts. Just a few candidates - Rochechouart crater in France, Saint Martin crater in Manitoba, Obolon crater in Ukraine, Red Wing crater in North Dakota. If there is any researcher or enthusiast out there able to get some funding go for it.:-)

If you have not seen a string impact video please check the well-known Shoemaker–Levy 9 string impacts on Jupiter in July 1994 on BBC Studios YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgOTcIfU75Y

As mentioned in the March 2020 paper in Nature (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-60867-w) there might have been multiple airbursts/impacts across at least four continents. These are proposed to have resulted from a one of a series of short-period, active comets known to break up frequently and to shed dozens to thousands of fragments that are 10 to 1000 m in diameter, each capable of producing catastrophic airburst/impacts. The largest cometary debris clusters are proposed to be capable of causing thousands of airbursts within a span of minutes across one entire hemisphere of Earth. An encounter with such a million-km-wide debris cluster would be thousands of times more probable than a collision with a 100-km-wide comet or a 10-km asteroid.",UCtyV7Beit_SWdT2KNr1vfyA,0.0,UgzDOCD785zQczLp2kZ4AaABAg,FjSyPxDy8lM,2020-02-20T04:02:21Z,climate crisis

Did you know that a claim for damages has been filed with the city of Los Angeles and the LA County Board of Supervisors after city funded Neighborhood Councils denied write-in candidate(s) equal opportunity to speak at candidate forums?  Did you know that the Los Angeles city clerk election division refuses equal opportunity to write-in candidates to have their video statements posted to the city clerk website? Did you know that the LA County Registrar mailed out over 5 million sample ballots and vote by mail ballots where voters are mislead and told that a list of qualified write-in candidates is not available until Feb. 22 when in reality the list was posted by the LA County Registrar around December 31, 2019? Just a series of efforts by the elite to illegally sway the course of the election. You won't see this in major mainstream newspapers but it is still voter fraud. If someone wanted to early vote for a write-in candidate, they would think that they could not do so until the Feb. 22, the way the system works in favor of the elite. The truth is that as a voter, you can vote TODAY  (as of Feb 3) for qualified write-in candidates and you can do so by mail or drop box;  or at the County Registrar office. So of course neither the LA County Registrar nor secretary of State Padilla has issued a press release on this issue. Neither have they responded to my emails about this. You won't see that in the newspapers. https://youtu.be/OTVXBgpYeHY  It is supposed to be called election transparency but it is not.  DEAN LOGAN SHOULD BE REPLACED. G.

Just a few days earlier on April 26, the Chernobyl nuclear power plant located in Ukraine exploded, releasing nuclear radiation 400 times that of the Hiroshima atomic bomb dropped during World War II. It was one of the most severe catastrophes in human history. Tens of thousands of people were infected with radioactive substances for a long time, and the land was equally contaminated. Chernobyl became a deserted city overnight.

Instead of saving lives, the first thing Soviet officials did was to conceal information. The earliest news about the disaster all came from foreign media outlets. Still, the Soviet Union refused to admit that there was nuclear radiation for fear of unrest among the people. No protective masks were distributed, and books about radiation were removed from libraries. All phone calls to Chernobyl were cut off.

Local officials moved their families out of Ukraine and quickly evacuated their children while keeping the general public in the dark without any protective measures.

The parade in Ukraine went ahead under orders from above. People were told to remove the radiation-contaminated lawn with shovels, without any protective equipment, and were not told why they should do so.

Doctors were not allowed to write “acute radiation syndrome” on medical reports. And water and air were declared safe in that area.",UCnK-Cmuy_BO8VheZHhXPS4w,0.0,Ugzvpt9-OFHRq9w5RBh4AaABAg,FjSyPxDy8lM,2020-02-20T04:02:21Z,climate crisis

The newspaper article also strongly condemned the human rights crisis.

The interim judgment by the Independent Tribunal Into Forced Organ Harvesting from Prisoners Of Conscience in China (the China Tribunal) was delivered in London on December 10, 2018.


Italian media outlet Libero published an article about the London tribunal.

The article stated, “After listening to 30 witnesses for three days, from 8 to 10 December, the Chair of the tribunal, Sir Geoffrey Nice, QC, …... concluded: The Tribunal’s members are all certain – unanimously, and sure beyond reasonable doubt – that in China forced organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience has been practiced for a substantial period of time involving a very substantial number of victims.""

The final judgment, which is due in spring 2019, promises details and figures. Though it carries no legal authority, it will serve as an evidence-based record that can place pressure on international organizations and raise public awareness.

Libero told its readers, “The Independent Tribunal is an independent public assembly inspired by the International Coalition to End Transplant Abuse in China (ETAC), the world's leading body to deal with the issue. Its constitution was announced in the British Parliament on the initiative of Jim Shannon, a Northern Irish member of the Democratic Unionist Party, president of the Interparliamentary Group for Religious Freedom.”",UCetGqso5aGfnvSkeFHiy7CQ,0.0,UgzCFZwvy81AFVNVQWB4AaABAg,FjSyPxDy8lM,2020-02-20T04:02:21Z,climate crisis

https://youtu.be/aThU9K8zJpY

We now have the capacity and organization to radically change how our planet works. Using earthworks, we can recharge aquifers, maximize CO2 trees sequester, maximize soil microbiology,  restore habitats, reduce flooding, reduce erosion, reduce toxic effluent pollution, and even make your home garden grow bigger tomatoes.

Here we discuss the importance on water staying IN soils and not running across the top of soils. Slowing, spreading and sinking water. Not only does this recharge aquifers, it prevents pollution runoff, it maximizes soil life and photosynthesis, which means your garden grows better! plus, water stored in soils doesn't evaporate away. Less watering, needed, less work.

These are tips we can all use, to make our lives easier.",UCfz0O9f_Ysivwz1CzEn4Wdw,0.0,Ugz7SmCBLF-kV_KMQKV4AaABAg,FjSyPxDy8lM,2020-02-20T04:02:21Z,climate crisis

The breaks in between segments were completely unnecessary.
(NBC capitalizing off commercial money instead of providing a continuous debate)

The time management and moderating was completely unprofessional.
(Everyone talking at the same time and over each other. Lack of direction.)

Moderators deliberately interrupting Bernie, Warren, and Klobuchar
(Cutting them off in the middle of answer. Sometimes just a few seconds after they were asked.)

There was no consistency or clean transition in between topics
(The questions being asked by the moderators switched up without buildup)

There was an obvious agenda to demonize Bloomberg
(Evident by the irrelevant questions given to him about his past, money, and health) 

The crowd in attendance was rude was clearly in favor of Biden
(Applauding everything Biden said regardless of its value and booing others)

Increases in CO2 have lead to a greener planet, not a warmer planet (though, warming is better for life than cooling). Therefore, carbon dioxide is not only ""Green"" but releasing sequestered carbon has provided much needed resource to the biological energy cycle of this planet and will someday be viewed by the majority of scientists as the single most positive effect  humans have had on this planet.

According to scientificamerican.com:
""Science has been linked to the politics of society since the first person thought it was a good idea to do research, and then convinced their neighbors to give them money to do it.""
And:
""Scientific research doesn't take place in a vacuum, it can only happen with society's blessing. In this way science is a political institution de facto, governed by society and beholden to it's political will.""
In addition: 
""There's also the matter of society's control over how science is conducted. Scientists, the normal humans that they are, are just as susceptible to being swept up by the cultural currents of their society as anyone else.""
Furthermore: 
""When we cast our vote in an election, part of what we are doing is determining what will be prioritized in scientific research. Our elected officials control our money, and therefore control our scientific pursuits.""
Lastly:
""Society decides what kind of knowledge scientists are permitted to obtain and disseminate. The Vatican famously imprisoned Galileo and forced him to recant his scientific assertions that the earth revolves around the sun to avoid being burned at the stake. Under Stalin, the Soviet government supported the science of Lysenko, a pseudoscientist who rejected basic principles in biology, because his theories supported the principles of Marxism. This gave rise to 'Lysenkoism,' a term used to reference the manipulation  of the scientific process to achieve ideological goals. This term seems more and more relevant today.""",UCZmnT8vc-ynIreZNCiZFfVQ,1.0,UgwcKYaRdP_G13c-X854AaABAg,FjSyPxDy8lM,2020-02-20T04:02:21Z,climate crisis

Unions had to make sacrifices in wage increases and other benefits like child care because healthcare was used as a negotiating tactic. Medicare For All is comprehensive and equal too or better than most union plans. Instead of having to renegotiate their healthcare every time and sacrificing wage increases and other benefits, unions can finally focus on securing wage increases for members. Under Medicare For All, union members have more comprehensive healthcare, that is guaranteed and can't be stripped and used against them when they go on strike. This happened to UAW members when GM took away their healthcare, leaving many members' families helpless. Even under union plans, there are still premiums (which is essentially a private tax), etc. Under Medicare For All, that's all eliminated. Unless you've been living under a rock Medicare For All saves money. ""The analysis, conducted by researchers at Yale University, the University of Florida and the University of Maryland, found that transitioning the U.S. to a single-payer health care system would actually save an estimated $450 billion each year, with the average American family seeing about $2,400 in annual savings. The research, which was published Saturday in the medical journal The Lancet, also found that Medicare for all would prevent about 68,000 unnecessary deaths per year."" - Newsweek  This isn't the only study that shows this.

Medicare For All is a single-payer program. You can choose what hospital you want and what doctor. You actually have more choice, because you don't have to worry about your Doctor being out of network. Medicare For All pays for whatever treatment your Doctor recommends like usual.

Quotes
In April 1997, Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen stated in a United States Department of Defense news briefing that: (Source: Department of Defense News Briefing: Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen)

“Others are engaging even in an eco-type of terrorism whereby they can alter the climate, set off earthquakes, volcanoes remotely through the use of electromagnetic waves.”

 

“The Importance of Understanding Clouds” (National Aeronautics and Space Administration). The document explains that clouds regulate the planets average temperature and help to spread the suns energy evenly over the earths surface. The article also quotes:

“Even small changes in the abundance or location of clouds could change the climate more than the anticipated changes caused by greenhouse gases, human-produced aerosols, or other factors associated with global change.“

Even at 410 ppm and anthropogenic CO2  is seven percent. is a little over 28 
PPM.93% is natural out gassing .Water Vapor is the Most important green house Gas.
The greenhouse effect   of CO2 is very small. Atomic absorption spectroscopy analysis
shows CO2 IS only capable of absorbing 7% of the  infrared electro magnetic spectrum  in the 15 micrometer frequency range CO2 has a very weak green house effect
Water vapor has about 850% stronger than CO2 
Water vapor is the sole Gas responsible for the green house effect .And CO2 is  is irrelevant
out gassing . 
In the industrial revolution 1940 1980  When CO2 was pumped into the atmosphere by the metric tons    Temperature went down .In the last 18 years no warming to be concerned

NOBODY on that stage is going to eliminate the subsidization of oil and gas. 
NOBODY on that stage is going to issue an Executive Order to stop drilling or mining on public lands.


The fact that there are some listening to this that will bark and clap like an obedient little seal when they hear these lovely ear-tickling proposals is so damn disappointing. These candidates, as crazy as they sound, know better (yes, even crazy 'ol Bernie). They know that they cannot just upend our entire economy in order to placate a few small activist groups. They understand that the vastly enormous economic system we've got, imperfect as it may be, cannot simply be changed at the whim of politicians driven by their own special interest groups.


I like that we've been closing down coal power plants. I like that our dependency on those is waning. What I don't like is this stupid climate alarmism demanding that I need to stop using or doing any given thing _today_ or else within a half dozen or so years, something bad will happen. 
Also- somebody please explain to me why it was a bad thing that we exited the Paris climate accord? Why was it so bad that we exited this non-binding resolution that did _not_ hold anybody (except ironically the US) accountable for their actions related to the climate? This was feel-good virtue-signaling to let others know that ""we care"" but otherwise will not make any real changes. News flash- we don't need a stupid accord to signal to the world that we think we need to make a change for the better- lets actually *make* that change and suggest the rest of the world follow suit if our numbers support our actions.",UCa-kTusYgBaRn9pEqG4p4eA,0.0,UgzKb6-aq06Xc0zNrXJ4AaABAg,FjSyPxDy8lM,2020-02-20T04:02:21Z,climate crisis

Hey Joe how is rail working out in California. They are now so far over budget I don’t think it will ever get completed. I think high-speed rail would be a good thing for this country but it can never be built under the corruption that takes place in these government projects. Just look at the SLS. 

Mike Bloomberg’s is more about supporting other countries than our own. All the Paris agreement did was make other countries rich while tying our hands. Sadly it does nothing for pollution since the biggest polluters are off the hook, India and China for example.

Warren just doesn’t make sense, What’s funny is the private sector has done more to help the environment then government scientists. if you can’t get the raw materials to build your green programs how is that going to work. There goes Warren pulling out the race card. it has nothing to do with the color of your skin but it’s about your pocketbook. Look at Flint Michigan for example heavy pollution and mostly white. You have to remember that much of the waste disposal was done in early years before it was regulated. Yes there are those who illegally dumped but don’t use the race card you’re pandering.

Bernie is misinformed, natural gas is cleaner and better for our environment that’s even some of your green programs. When turbines destroy wildlife, solar farms destroy land. 

Amy these environmental agreements do not stop the gross polluter’s like China and India. All it does is cost our country money and tie our hands. We do United States is probably the cleanest super power on the market.
Anybody remember carbon credits, what a joke that was. it turned into a money making scam. And did very little for pollution.
Warren Yes there is corruption it’s called the Democrats and Rinos. How much did congress get done since they took power. Sure they put out a lot of bills but nothing BiPartisan.

These are all filled good speeches but intern they have done nothing. Joe remember you were at the level of vice president and had power to get things done. What happened your first time around.

But I can't find an actual Scientist of repute who backs their claims.

I've worked with over a hundred fellow physicist (3 PhDs) Chemists, and yes, Climate Scientists.
The subject has come up with nearly every one of them, and the closest to support any of them ever offered was to say there is NO evidence to support it, but none to dispute it either, it would take decades of data-collectin to form a viable basis for the science and we were Denied the chance to obtain that.
Professors who did not support the theory without evidence, Lost tenure, grants to those who did not offer unqualified, universal support, Lost Grants.

It became clear in the immediate that if you worked in a university setting or had grants from any governing body, you had no choice but to procllaim it a certainty.
But those same scientists, in person-to-person discussion, held the opposing viewpoint.

Science... is not supposed to be subjective, let alone subject oto political whins.
Flat Eart reminds us how well that works - ith some of thegreatest minds in their fields forced to agree or diee... and many of those who arer referenced as supporting the flat-earth claims, produced written records showing that th4ey, in fact, did no such thing.

We will soon see the same with Heating Trend/Pending Ice Age/AGW/Climate Change.
And take note.
Climate change isn't even a theory.
It lacks any method of disproov.

If it gets hotter, it proves climate change.
If it gets Cooler, it proves climate change.
And if it fails to change, it proves climate change.

They, for the most part, clearly don’t have very strong grasps on environmental science. We cannot just outlaw fossil fuels and expect society to not fall apart. We must first replace fossil fuels in energy production with reliable green energy such as nuclear power. Look at France, 75% of their electricity is nuclear while solar and wind are only about 2-3%. Forget the PCA, we should fix ourselves before even thinking about telling other countries what to do. We tend to jump ahead with things like electric cars but what good are they if the electricity is from fossil fuel power plants? When it comes to mining, we cannot just stop as we need those resources. Warren talked about “sustainable” mining as if that’s a thing (we mine for things that don’t replenish themselves so it is impossible to be sustainable). Instead, we need to make technological advancements like sodium (a very abundant element) ion batteries so we don’t need to mine for nearly as much lithium (a rare and toxic metal). Maybe focus on phasing out coal and oil before natural gas, which can act as a temporary main source of energy until we can reach mostly green. It seems to me most of these people are exaggerating the current state of global warming and using it as an excuse to implement their socialist policies. If the government was less of a regulation monster, private nuclear power plants could become more abundant. If a candidate truly cared about environmental issues, they’d talk about specific solutions, not regurgitated crap about solar and wind power (two very inefficient and destructive energy sources on a big scale). A big problem we face is the disappearing of the Ogallala Auqifer from us taking more water from it than is being replaced but they aren’t talking about that. Biden said cities are experiencing the worst, maybe thats because they are all run by Democrats? Warren kept referring to “colored communities”, isn’t that a little racist instead of calling them “poor”? Don’t believe these clowns, do your own research on environmental science as many people are ignorant on it. Can you (the reader) explain the actual science behind climate change? Define albedo, global warming potential, ozone (good and bad), CFCs, etc. Please watch some informational videos and documentaries so you can teach climate change deniers the real science rather than calling them idiots. For example, telling someone “the poor ice caps are melting and sea levels are rising” doesn’t prove global warming is human caused. That’s is an affect not proof. That proves nothing because without evidence by the scientific reasoning, you could argue that aliens are shining a laser at the poles. Remember that environmentalism isn’t political, it’s about life, all life. Republicans don’t hate nature, in fact more spend more time in it than Democrats I’m sure, they just don’t like big government and socialism.",UC20obsQLtnzWw1fSSdHfy-A,0.0,UgxnMcDi1RY2mm-VAKl4AaABAg,FjSyPxDy8lM,2020-02-20T04:02:21Z,climate crisis

Where did the ideas of America’s leaders today come from? From our educational institutions..In the 1960s and ’70s, America had many problems with rioting and violence on college campuses. Educators would ask who was in charge, and in almost every case, there was nobody in charge except the people who were rioting. Soon, the New Left began to get into those institutions and gain control. It was in the education system that the left got its foothold into the nation: first in colleges, then high schools and even elementary schools. The New Left was a powerful political movement that sw​ept through the nation in the 1960s and 1970s. Agitators and educators worked to bring about changes in homosexual rights, abortion, gender roles, drugs and other issues. The movement was closely tied to the “hippie” movement, and it achieved many of its lawless goals. The New Left was almost identical to the Communist Party! The champions of the movement had stunning success in working their way into key positions in today’s Democratic Party! Look at the radical left today.

He had technology almost 100 years ago that would benefit not only the U.S but the whole world. His brilliance and intellect was above and beyond anyone. He worked with Thomas Edison for a short while , which did not work out..Edison became so jealous of him , He rejected mostly everything he proposed. Tesla had designed plans for free clean energy that was hidden in the earth's atmosphere. He also had an endless amount of proven technology and devices  that would make todays technology look antiquated. Do you know what the U.S gov't , the electric and oil companies did to him ? They stopped funding his projects and scrapped everything he created. When He died broke  , the Gov't took all his plans , designs and hundreds of files, never to be seen again. Now the politicians  talk about Climate change , the carbon foot print and clean energy ?? Are you kidding me ??   Tesla saw this coming problem and that's why He wanted to do something about it.  the Gov't will NEVER do anything about it  , I don't care what they say. .There is way too much money involved  ( Trillions ) over time and lobbyist funding politicians. Some things never change , right ?  The only time you see Tesla's name today is on back of a car, not just any car.

There is not anuff space here to go in detail; but on average (All solar cell panels must be replaced ever 1-3 years and at the cost of 30g's or 1000g,s a pop.) Nope not real good ideal and this is on the low end price wise. Like I said I work in the industry. I think steam driven turbines with solar array like Abudabi dose is a good ideal. The solar industry is still in its infancy stage right now. It has to do alot of work to get better. There is another way to heat our houses and keep them cool. In Germany there are clean burning fire places that has low emissions of smoke in the air but Americas are tree huggers so thats out. I can go on and on. We need smart young people investing themselves in science education. For every dollar spent on usless activism could be invest into research grants for low income to have education dedicated to those seeking out earth scinces. This world is driven by money thats that. Everyone wants to be the next actor, Football player, Rockstar, Rapper fame fame. People lie to their selves. No one wants to go hungery who has hungered ask a poor homeless person sometime. He will say hell no I hate being without. Only fools are jealous of the ritch because they say they destroy the world but they want their money to fix a society problem. Population growth impacts the whole world by far than anything. More fule more food more trash more deforestation look at Brazil you can't lay solar panels in a juggle. You have to have line of site. I have lobbied politicians to make pro solar growth bills in California. Even that has not helped. It a way of being honest wiyh our self. San Francisco, Vagas, LA, New York, ect. ect. Uses electricity to lite up every billboard, street, and building 24-7 ever ask youself how much energy drives these lights 365 days of the year? No one ever turns them off and more are added every day. If that is not power wasted well all America should slam a big giant needle of Fentanyl in our arms and sleep the ignorant sleep of truth less. We are not real. Like I said Pie in the sky. Its okay to dream that how we made it to the moon. Unless you beliefss are the earth is flat, autism is caused by inoculation, we faked the moon landing. No matter what I say matters then. But I do think its a great plan but the whole country has to be onboard. Not every state took up the mandated healthcare act. Thanks I hope I made some sense and don't spund out of my mind or I opposed your ideals because of politics. I don't trust any politician to make my world better. We the people have yo want it. That starts with true hard factual education that uses the scientific prosses. Not hopped up we die in 12yrs because I said so.

Just to clarify the chemical reaction of the green house effect is proven and not debatable it's a chemical reaction. Obviously I recognize that that is caused by Increased CO2 emissions. With that said in the past 115 years the global temperatures have only risen 0.85 degrees these are numbers directly from the UN climate report. They acknowledge that temperature change has been happening on a global scale since the ice age and that this is on record and heavily recognized. They blatantly miss inform the public by not sitting this. By their own projections if we followed everyone of their measures like going to net zero emissions, we would still see a temperature rise of 2.7 degrees by 2100 if we continued on current projections the earth would warm 3.2 degrees 0.5 degrees caused by human impact to climate change that's it. Now let me ask you this, is there any difference between the weather 115 years ago and the weather today. Not in the slightest this is all recorded data.

It sets up a picture so that Bloomberg and Sanders are ""extremes"" so therefore Buttigieg is not extreme.

CO2 and H2O are clean and natural and the building blocks of life.   CO2 is not a pollutant.  And molten salt Thorium reactors are safe , clean and scaleable.   China is going all out to get it before us.  We developed the technology in the 50s and left it for all the worng reasons.    Stay out of Paris which focuses on CO2 which is bad scinece and totaly wrong.  Continue to lead the world in reducing pollution and keeping our air and water clean....and plant tons of trees.

Bernie is still with us, but he likes to talk at length of impossible dreams and unrealistic schemes. Bernie, can you keep it down a tad, others are trying to watch the TV program, Wheel of Fortune is on, don't you know? And, finally, here we have our good old friend Joe. He is our most needy patient, because he thinks he's fine when, in fact, he's anything but. We have to remind him to take his medications regularly and refresh his memory every so often. You see, he talks a lot about all the important things he has done, but he doesn't really realize all that happened decades ago. He is sweet, but a bit cuckoo up there, you know what I mean?

in 2000 over 10% off landmass are inhabited and around 37% are used.

yes, the planet, nature, humans have been here for a long time. but industrialisation and konsumerism are a phenomenon of modern times (at least in this scale).

if 4-6-12-25 or 150 years, doesn't matter. a growing humanity with growing unhinged consumption on a limited space... not much to think about, it's quite simple.

not to mention, that ecosystems once gone can not be simply constructed again...
WE are the the 6th mass extinction. see anthropocene.

Where the policy gets those things right (which the green new deal makes major pains to do) most potentially impacted workers end up in better positions or at least are not worse off, and those who are have that impact limitied. Meanwhile net gain of millions of good jobs are created leaving millions of working class people much better off. To me that seems very clearly good for the working class, its one thing to say you still don't think its worth it but to lable peole who who strongly disagree with you as therefore beeing hipocrities is wildly off the mark.",UCy0al8xWtusFMjz1H29qN7g,1.0,UgztCA3il6do3w4vCwR4AaABAg,FjSyPxDy8lM,2020-02-20T04:02:21Z,climate crisis

She says you have to stop all mining and off shore drilling but for the industries that are for her? Who makes this determination? Her reply is illogical. Actually, M. Bloomberg is the only one on the stage that has built a successful business. Americans, socialism is also illogical at this time. Yes, a small amount of controlled socialism is essentially what Canada and the Scandinavia does already and it is hard to rein in.  The reform of the medical system is way above the understanding of anyone on the stage. Medical Care in America can never be like Canada or Norway or whatever country that has a tiny population and is highly taxed. Americans, do not envy Canadian socialized medicine. I have many, many examples of seniors being on wait lists and giving up and going to the States to the best doctors. Bernie keeps making a reference to Canada wrongly. Canada has the population of one state that is California and Canada has an incompetent leader that is mismanaging the country. Canadians have serious issues with a two tiered system already. Bernie is talking without knowing. Do not listen to the obtuse bubble head Jim Carrey that has not lived or relied on anything but his Hollywood fortune and capitalism for decades. Jim Carrey has NO IDEA about working Canadians and the serious issues in Canada today. He won a proverbial lotto ticket with some skill as a stand up comic however Carrey realized expeditiously with the help of the greater Rodney Dangerfield and others that the movies would make him rich. The Hollywood system is raw capitalism. Carrey is a raw capitalist and took the money from it gladly to finance a lifestyle he could only dream about in Ontario. Carrey is lost and irrelevant today. What tomfoolery!  My point is also Carrey is a complete hypocrite. He did witness his father that could not keep a job under the government of the father of the trudeau boy in office now; PE Trudeau (failed socialist) largely shocked the Canadian economy from (1968-83)  that has always been  under transition for millions. PE Trudeau was a socialist lawyer and politician. PE Trudeau was also a trust fund kid.  His son was a failed drama teacher and a trust fund kid that stumbled into federal politics. This is how horrible the choices are in Canada. In fact,  Carrey is from my hometown and I knew his family from afar. My older sibling worked with his dad on a few odd jobs.  I left Canada for the same reasons Jim Carrey did; I did not want to end up like his parents. Canada has a seasonal economy for millions. Canada does not provide very good jobs. Period. Canada celebrates those that talk and write in pretty ways for the Crown and HMQ. This is fact. Americans won a revolution in 1776 to be cut from the British Crown. America is a FREE Republic that has made some errors but largely successful for all now.  Americans have to reform the medical system slowly over generations. A shock to the economy right now could end all improvements in the economy.  Do not try to put in some quick revolution or some Obamacare or Sanders nonsense. Obama was a great talker. Very little aptitude on the action department. Sanders is simply a very confused, contradictory man.  It is a slow process to make the medical system better in the States and keep providing charity hospitals for the desperately poor as you slowly put in reforms to make the system better for all. Do not follow any other country. America needs only an American medical system designed for them only.",UCd_5_wOvOc9V9hqjBF-rGLg,0.0,UgywW6d7jA7erP_Hru14AaABAg,FjSyPxDy8lM,2020-02-20T04:02:21Z,climate crisis

A modified theory of gravity allows periodic extra tidal energy to transport heat from the equator to the poles. This brings increased  precipitation which falls as snow. This accumulates into advancing glaciers. Glaciers are always melting but if the extra snowfall decreases then the glaciers retreat and the world enters an interglacial.

The snowfall of Antarctica has increased by 10% in the last 200 years which indicates the planet is slowly entering the 100,000-year cycle.

Difficult situation. I do hope that your situation improves. The past few months where I live it has been much colder than normal and extreme precipitation. It rains, snows, or hails constantly. We had a rather dry and hot summer this year but what tends to happen is that it gets balanced out with below average cold and excess moisture in the region during the fall and winter months. This is what seems to be happening. Weather has cycles. Some of it has to do with solar activity. There are lots of influences. But it concerns me when the so called climate science contradicts themself and it still gets passed off as science. Carbon taxes, and just the way governments exploit the topic is alarming. Climate Change appears to be mostly a political movement to tax and control economies and freedom of people globally. Yes carbon dioxide levels are slowly rising but this is not a concern nor is it a toxin. Plant life thrives on increases of CO2. Crops in my area continue to do better every year.

The earth is about four billion years old and has always gone through stages of cooling down and heating up. CO2 is the gas of life. We breath it out, plants and treas breath it in then release oxygen, without one and another trees etc would not exit and neither would we. The oceans cover most of the planet and release CO2 as well. The more the better, it does not warm the planet as much as we are being told. They called it global warming originally but had to change it to climate change when they realised the average temperatures were slightly going down. They lie to us and try and brain wash us through the media etc etc for reasons to suit them. Their aim is for global control and profit from introducing green tax on systems etc saying they will cool the planet, but it will be going in their pockets and other things, not cooling the planet. Problem, action solution. Create the man made climate change lie, when man has almost nothing to do with it, wait for the reaction, protests etc, which is exactly what they want, then hey presto, offer the solution. New tax regimes. If they didn’t create the lie, and just try and implement the new tax regimes, a lot of those climate protesters today would be out protesting against the new tax regimes. Fact. The scientists that agree with them are government funded through universities etc so their hands are tied and they can’t speak freely and have to go along with the governments. The scientists who are independent whose hands are not tied will tell you the same as me but in much more details. They try to shut them up in various ways and even ban them from publishing their own facts in some cases. People need to look the proper facts up and realise what’s going on. The main cause for global cooling or warming is down to decreased or increased solar activity on the surface of the sun. The solar rays from increased sun spot activity break through the earths atmosphere and warm the oceans slightly. Also the moon is affected which effects the tides, and it effects the jet steam moving it slightly  up or down, which’s effects the weather one way or another above it it and below it. I will say this though. I am all for the local environment issues. Car exhaust fumes etc which effect people with bronchitis etc and skin problems. The waste plastic in our oceans needs to be addressed too and other issues. Check out piers corbyn for climate facts. He is an independent scientist as well as many others. CO2 does not create warming, it follows it. Also when the temperature goes down it then follows that too, but there is an 8 hundred year lag before it starts to follow it due to the slower temperature changes in the oceans. Most of the planet is ocean and the warmer they are the more CO2 they emit. The charts originally showed that lag too with the spikes in temperature and CO2 being 8 hundred years apart but they falsified the charts and put both the spikes together to make it look like CO2 was to blame to suit their own agenda as explained above. If they were so worried about man made CO2 then why do they not do something about termites which create ten times more CO2 than we do ?. Out of the whole atmosphere only about 0.04 percent of it is CO2 and only about 4 percent of that 0.04 percent is man made. Also think about this one. Why are developers investing in building all around the world on coast lines if they think in about 20 years time they will be flooded? Also why are the banks investing money to those developers to help them build, and providing long term mortgages to people to buy those properties etc on the coast lines? The answer to that is they know damn well that man made climate change is a hoax. I will mention again, check out piers corbyn and others, independent scientists, not government funded, hands not tied and can speak freely without the risk of loosing their livelihood. Again think about this. Out of the whole of the earths atmosphere, only about 0.04 percent of it is CO2. From that, only 4 percent of that 0.04 percent is CO2 that is man made.

As a scientist, I gave myself the time and the method to understand this area and I discovered many erroneous and even falsified information.
It is time that the Head of countries including US, Europe and France agrees to question the political correctness that is leading us into the wall.
It is time for serious newspapers to address the issue, there is no scientific consensus, and many serious publications question the ideology of CO2-induced global warming.
The IPCC is a political body whose objective is to transfer considerable sums (several hundred billion Euros/U$D from Western democratic countries to developing countries under the pretext of a climate change linked to the production of CO2, it is time to revisit this topic in a scientific way, many experts question the conclusion about the role of CO2 and climate change.
I suggest creating an independent scientific council to check the information and conclusions.
Professor François Gervais' recent book ""Climate Emergency is a lure"" clearly poses the problem and I suggest opening the debate scientifically by avoiding ideology and preconceived ideas.
More important many publications indicate that a certain number of data would have been falsified see:
Mr. Tony Heller explained why NASA and NOA data are manipulated to make us to believe that there is a global warming!!
In health Care world fraud is heavily punished with de-baring, could that be implemented for scientist committing fraud regarding climate?

Yes, alarmists love showing pictures of land surface ice breaking off into the ocean... as if that is some new phenomenon. The simple fact is it's all part of a much larger, and much more complicated system, and to some degree or another, it is being renewed continually. But they claim this ""ancient"" ice is ""gone forever, never to return""... and yet the polar ice caps are still there.  And they always fail to mention the vast majority of sea ice is under the water's surface, out of view, thus making the sea ice look significantly less than it actually is. I generally ignore any and all close up shots, seeing as they can easily be taken out of context... the same way they love to bog us down with minute details, and charts, and figures... usually all taken out of their much broader context, in order to confuse the unsuspecting viewer. It's all quite pathetic, in my humble opinion.

I watched a video yesterday that first mentioned ice studies at the polar regions (plural), but then it focused only on the arctic ice cap shrinking, and conveniently failed to show the antarctic ice sheet, which was actually growing at the same time... very deceptive.

What people don't realize is, whenever collecting data there are flaws. This is boiled down to simplistic levels, pretending to be perfect.

That is an increase from 0.028 % of the atmosphere (280 ppm) over approx. 270 years, (1750 - 2020), so an actual increase of 130 ppm, or an extra 0.013% of the atmosphere. 

0.041 % ÷ 0.028 % = a 46 % increase in co2 levels. ( not to be confused with 46 % of the atmosphere ). Add to that, the widely accepted, well known fact that increasing co2 gives diminishing returns. So, for example, a doubling of co2, ( or a 100 % increase in co2 levels ), will only result in approx. 1*C temp rise. So, even at 560 ppm, (2× 280 ppm), or 0.056 % of the atmosphere, temps would rise only 1*C. We have seen an approx. 1.4*C increase, over that 270 years, indicating there are (many) other factors at play....

You don't like to pay taxes? Me neither. Companies don't either.
So suddenly we are in the same boat of finding solutions to avoid them.
And that's the whole point of a carbon tax. Along the way, as it still has some effect, it may help finance some renewable projects.

That means that our current CO2 levels are the result of Earth's overall temperature 800 years ago.  World leaders have convinced their dependents that this works in the reverse order, relatively quickly, and that we are to blame, so that they can tax us out of a false shared guilt in order to be able to afford to ""fight"" climate change, an unstoppable natural cycle.

Historical Carbon Dioxide Record from the Vostok Ice Core

Period of Record
417,160 - 2,342 years BP

Methods
In January 1998, the collaborative ice-drilling project between Russia, the United States, and France at the Russian Vostok station in East Antarctica yielded the deepest ice core ever recovered, reaching a depth of 3,623 m (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Ice cores are unique with their entrapped air inclusions enabling direct records of past changes in atmospheric trace-gas composition. Preliminary data indicate the Vostok ice-core record extends through four climate cycles, with ice slightly older than 400 kyr (Petit et al. 1997, 1999). Because air bubbles do not close at the surface of the ice sheet but only near the firn-ice transition (that is, at ~90 m below the surface at Vostok), the air extracted from the ice is younger than the surrounding ice (Barnola et al. 1991). Using semiempirical models of densification applied to past Vostok climate conditions, Barnola et al. (1991) reported that the age difference between air and ice may be ~6000 years during the coldest periods instead of ~4000 years, as previously assumed. Ice samples were cut with a bandsaw in a cold room (at about -15°C) as close as possible to the center of the core in order to avoid surface contamination (Barnola et al. 1983). Gas extraction and measurements were performed with the ""Grenoble analytical setup,"" which involved crushing the ice sample (~40 g) under vacuum in a stainless-steel container without melting it, expanding the gas released during the crushing in a pre-evacuated sampling loop, and analyzing the CO2 concentrations by gas chromatography (Barnola et al. 1983). The analytical system, except for the stainless-steel container in which the ice was crushed, was calibrated for each ice sample measurement with a standard mixture of CO2 in nitrogen and oxygen. For further details on the experimental procedures and the dating of the successive ice layers at Vostok, see Barnola et al. (1987, 1991), Lorius et al. (1985), and Petit et al. (1999).

Trends
There is a close correlation between Antarctic temperature and atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (Barnola et al. 1987). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows that the main trends of CO2 are similar for each glacial cycle. Major transitions from the lowest to the highest values are associated with glacial-interglacial transitions. During these transitions, the atmospheric concentrations of CO2 rises from 180 to 280-300 ppmv (Petit et al. 1999). The extension of the Vostok CO2 record shows the present-day levels of CO2 are unprecedented during the past 420 kyr. Pre-industrial Holocene levels (~280 ppmv) are found during all interglacials, with the highest values (~300 ppmv) found approximately 323 kyr BP. When the Vostok ice core data were compared with other ice core data (Delmas et al. 1980; Neftel et al. 1982) for the past 30,000 - 40,000 years, good agreement was found between the records: all show low CO2 values [~200 parts per million by volume (ppmv)] during the Last Glacial Maximum and increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations associated with the glacial-Holocene transition. According to Barnola et al. (1991) and Petit et al. (1999) these measurements indicate that, at the beginning of the deglaciations, the CO2 increase either was in phase or lagged by less than ~1000 years with respect to the Antarctic temperature, whereas it clearly lagged behind the temperature at the onset of the glaciations.

But do you see the difference? The temperature stopped to follow the Sun since about 1970.

The sea level of 300 mm is not devastating, but it is alarming. 
It is A) due to ice melting on Greenland and Antarctica and B) thermal expansion, warm water rises.
The problem is - it is accelerating. Not by looking at the chart, but by looking what is actually causing it.
And more importantly, due to studies of the data from the past the sea level rises by roughly 2,3 m for each 1°C temperature change. This is why dr. Hansen is talking about ""up to 5 meter in the near future (=next century)""

The climate change started with 280 ppm CO2. He was asked about 560 ppm.
Today we are at about 410.
If you would actually read the report (or the testimony) in 1988/89, he predicted 3 probable scenarios, depending on how much CO2 humans would produce, adding that the middle one was the most probable.

Another point - according to the climate knowledge of that time of that time (1988), doubling the CO2 would rise the average temperature by 4,2°C. Today with 30 years more data, the consensus is that the most probable value is 3°C-
*He wasn't lying or exaggerating, he was using the best knowledge of that time. And he was asked about the worst possible scenario.*

Those people just have narrow mindsets and can't even understand the bigger picture of what is happening around the world. They feel threatened that the abolishment of fossil fuels would have a negative effect on their lives, when there are solutions to go around it, one of which is stated in the video, and the other examples can be seen from the Canadian carbon tax ($50 per tonne of co2, allowing money to be redistributed and channelled into projects that serve the public better), the  EU ETS (which ensures companies dont emit more co2 than their allocated quota, the fines imposed on non-compliant companies prevents other companies from emitting gases (besides co2, which is although stimulates breathing in humans, at high levels, can cause tachypnea (excessive breathing)) like nitrous oxide and perfluorocarbons which affects public health), etc.  Climate deniers prefer to focus on the very tiny errata or flaws in climate change advocates and amplify them to defame them or to prove their point, ignoring the facts and prefer to immerse themselves in the beautiful little world full of factories and industries dumping co2 into the atmosphere and breathing in the freshness of the gaseous cocktail of co2, ch4, CFCs, etc. Apparently now, even your opinion on climate change is a definition of your political stance, and that is what happens when your president's party sells plastic straws for the sole reason of countering their rival liberals which were selling paper straws out of consideration for the climate. If you are a die-hard climate denier, then pls dont run for president, or any powerful role like minister or senator, letting imbeciles to run society is the equivalent of self-destruction. We are on track to dramatic reduction in carbon levels or on track to signing the death certificate of all future generations. Good luck, world! Hopefully, we would still exist in the near future!

EDIT: I would like to add on that denying climate change is happening or denying humans as the root cause of it is not healthy skepticism and  but blatant ignorance of the facts. Yes, we should practise healthy skepticism when we see huge corpuses of data showing such frightening correlation between human activity and environmental degradation and climate change, we should ignore those data that is highly improbable, on both ends of the spectrum, then count how many of those datasets that make sense show support or oppose the correlation and that humans have a pivotal role in climate change. Climate deniers say data is cherrypicked, and that scientists profit from those media uproar on climate change, sadly, this claim, is once again nothing but irrational, as shown from https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2017-10-25/climate-change-sceptics-converted/9053406 which showed how some scientists who were once skeptics of climate change finally understood climate change is an existential issue, but still maintained a healthy level of skepticism on climate change

EDIT: ""90% of all articles that deny climate change comes from right-wing politics.""  and ""Those promoting denial commonly use rhetorical tactics to give the appearance of a scientific controversy where there is none""

But those changes were researched, changes were not very big and except for local changes, they were generally driven by the Sun.

B) One hot (or cold year) 1878 does't say anything, that's cherry-picking. 50 or even more precisely measured data is a trend 
C) Yes, Vikings settled Greenland, but I bet they didn't grow lettuce and other vegetables like they do now (I've seen in a video) and 
D) we have a detailed temperature record about the last 150 years or so. The Earth is warming up, rapidly. The temperature record is global, undeniable and precise, even confirmed by satelite measurements.

Looking further back? How about looking 140 year back, is this OK?
Until 1960 nothing much happened, the climate pretty much followed the amount of sunlight the Earth was getting from the Sun, give or take.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_activity_and_climate
But since then the temperatures are going ballistic.
Why? Well, the CO2 level in the previous centuries was fairly constant at about 280 ppm. In 1960 it was just closing in on 320 ppm. An increase, but not that dramatic yet.
Look at the recent levels. We are beyond 410.

It is over 30% more than it has been for the past 10-15 million years and rising. We release 12000 tons of co2 every 10 seconds. We release over 8-9 gigatons per year, rising.Yes, excess amounts of co2 in the atmosphere are harmful, because they drive the temperature up, a process that is well understood, documenmted and proven.
What is also known is that, in the entire history of the earth, global temperature and co2 levels have always been related. When it was really hot on earth, co2 levels were really high and vice versa.
What is also known is that in the past 600000 years, there were several cold and hot periods, where temperatures shifted several degrees (parallel to co2 levels).
One such cycle from hot to cold lasted approximately 100000 years each time.

Now, we raised temperature by one degree in just 30-40 years. Scientists say our earth is warming 10-20 times faster than at any other point in time of earths history.

So what about the rest of the plant? (Summary of water cycle) Transpiration through the stomata of the leaves of plants cools it down a lot due to water's insanely high latent heat of vaporisation, which transfers loads of heat from plants to the atmosphere. The water vapor then reaches saturation point high up in the troposphere causing condensation which results in the formation of clouds and the vast amounts of energy lost to the surroundings during this stage causes negligible changes in temperature due to the sparseness of air near the tropopause. The radiation, however is released into space as water droplets have very very low transmissivity, so very low amounts of EM waves permeate through. Due to the fact that plants generally have very very high amounts of water (90-95% from https://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/earth/geophysics/h2o5.htm ), and since it has extremely high specific heat capacity of 4180J/Kkg, it requires a huge amount of heat to heat it up. Water has high absorptance, yet the vast majority of radiation only results in negligible temperature increases and microwave radiation, despite being one of the best frequency to heat water, requires a huge amount of energy flux density, of up to 0.1 - 0.2 W/cm^2 for significant heat gain over a reasonable amount of time.

If you think my argument does not make sense, then consider the effect of global warming everywhere across the world besides the equator (Desertification, Higher frequency and intensity of storms, etc.). What you stated in your comment is not how scientists arrived at the consensus on global warming. No, you don't just put a thermometer at one location and observe its fluctuations over decades. Evidence from the gases trapped in ancient glaciers and ice showed that the usual carbon dioxide levels used to be only slightly above half of what it is now, 200 - 250 ppm, also you monitor the temperatures from a large variety of locations across the world, to obtain the general rising trend of temperatures.

I am frustrated with many of the reports that the climate scientists base their findings on.  A lot of the data in their own reports, especially when you look at their on citations of data presented, are skewed by either cherry picking, narrowing sample periods, or failing to highlight margins of error.  An easy example of this are ground temps measured over time in areas that were rural and are now urban.  This is a skew of data, as the variables surround the thermal measuring instrument have changed and should be removed from the overall average.  A thermometer on grass is cooler than one on pavement on the same data, within the same mile.  When you start to dig deep into the data, you realize it his heavily flawed and is a very poor (if not false) statistical model.  This is why there is now this uprising.

Norway is taking a significant cut of the petrol industries profits while also demanding the use of the most expensive equipment and security mesures. We have made it ""to expensive"" yet we stil produce. this in a country that is relying above 95% on hydroelectric energy.


No expence is to high when it comes to fosile fuels as it currently stands, if you tax it any higher millions will suffer where the demand for it is the differance between life or death.


Take notice of one thing that is rather alarming, Wind power has a larger carbon footprint than most fosile fuels, why you might ask?
A wind turbines lifespan is limited, it's production over it's lifespan is also dependant on there actually beeing enough yet not to mutch wind.
When calculating in all the fosile energy consumed to produce, transport and assemble a wind turbine, it will lose to all types of power plants that has invested in tech to trap the emmisions.




But either way, If we compare the fearmongering to actual action. the whole climat crisis goes down the drain.
If it was rly sutch a thing as impending doom, we would have seen hughe investments into actual green energy (LFR - Thorium reactor technology).


And to provoke some thought, the scare mongerers are screaming their heads off at a CO2 percentage of less than 0.05% 500ppm
The highest recorded amount in prehestoric history is around 0.4% or 4000ppm
Now if you consider the fact that just about every molecule of O2 was produced trough photosyntesis.
That is no less than 21% of our current atmosphere, or 210'000ppm

Our orbit around the sun is not circular but varies from circular to elliptical, so our distance from the sun is not the same when we are in an elliptical orbit. 

Maunder minimum (Lack of sunspots) is considered to have caused the Little Ice Age which lasted from the 1300’s to around 1850.  This points to the sun not being constant in the amount of energy produced by the sun.  How much of the warming of the planet after 1850 was due to sunspot activity and how much was due to increasing CO2 and water vapor? 

Water vapor is a green house gas and makes up around 4% of the atmosphere.  CO2 is referred to as a trace element in the atmosphere because it makes up just 4/10’s of one percent of the atmosphere. You conclude the only reason for the planet warming is due to CO2 and methane.  

A few years back (2016) scientist had predicted the suns next 11-year solar cycle would start a cooling period. A Russian mathematician, Valentina Zharkova, studying the suns magnetic fields, has also predicted little sunspot activity for the next two solar cycles.  The year this new solar cycle was expected to begin was around 2018-2019. The winter of 2018-2019 has had early snowfall around the world and colder than normal temperatures from the previous few years.",UC7rmJn_v40UjeQYsnICCU4A,1.0,UgwVYFl6FysGVp5owpx4AaABAg,fWInyaMWBY8,2012-03-07T17:10:33Z,climate crisis

""It's this kind of logic that have people believing a rise in CO2 level is the only reason our planet would warm"" - In the presence of a constant sun, a circular Earth orbit, and a constant angle of tilt, *CO2 (and methane) ARE the only reason the planet warms.*
Without the Milankovitch Cycle the natural Earth would cool slowly as mountain erosion and the photosynthesis of Life sequester the atmospheric CO2 until the Earth freezes to the Equator.  This freezing stops those processes, and it takes millions of years for naturally-emitted volcanic CO2 to top up the atmosphere until it becomes hot enough to melt the Snowball Earth.
The Earth has a Milankovitch Cycle which cyclically varies its insolation by the Sun, and interferes with its Snowball Cycle, producing greater and lesser ice ages as a consequence.
The Sun is stable and constant, for the purposes of this discussion.  Its output has very small cyclic variations to an almost-level slope of a very slowly rising output which will climax 4,500,000,000 years from now.
Even so, scientific papers have been produced since the sixties which show that the next Ice Age would have appeared at around 17,000 years in the future, not accounting for the atmospheric carbon dumped into the atmosphere by Man since the start of the Industrial Revolution.
Venus is warmer than it would otherwise be because of its massive CO2 atmosphere and also its massive sulphuric acid clouds.
If you would like to confirm this you need only read Hansen's publications where you can confirm his calculations.  These have been peer-reviewed, confirmed, so his claims have complete scientific backing.  They are true.

1) History has proven that co2 does NOT cause warming. At the very most it will add .5°C per doubling of co2 WITH all the forcing factors.

2) Co2 was at historic low During the last glaciation. Had it decreased a tiny bit more, it would have caused the death of all life on this planet. It has been decreasing for millions of years as more and more of the carbon is stuck below ground and beneath the sea. Everything we add to the atmospheric co2 increases the lifespan of live on earth.

3) Increasing co2 increases the amount of plant food that the plants can create and thus the amount of animals, including humans that the planet can feed.

""The electricity has to be produced by carbon free energy sources like ... solar, wind "" Despite what many people believe, solar and wind are NOT carbon free. Once they are created, they still have to have another source of power as backup since they are so unsteady. Nuclear has major problems with extremely dangerous risks. hydro and geo power plants are extremely site locational. The vast majority of the earth can not be feed by them.

A better way would be a gravity power, but for some reason no one is interested in using it. If it was really about getting cheap safe electricity why is no one looking at this?

""We need electric cars"" In time the technology will replace I.C.E. engines, but forcing it will only harm the economy and ecology. Producing the batteries produces a lot of toxic materials and recycling them is both dangerous and very toxic as well.

In other words, its about money for people like him and Al Gore. If there is no alarms, no one would have voted for a carbon tax, and none of them would be making millions of dollars.

Then you have people like Michael Mann. Before his study with the fake hockey stick graph, he was an associate professor with limited chances of getting his tenure. As such he was limited to about 60k per year income. Now he gets $100k per speech, with several speeches a year. This is on top of owning stock in the same carbon tax credit exchange.

Everyone of the leaders that is pushing the alarmism, makes big money from it.

Then you have the IPCC. Their ""report to policy makers"" mentioned eradicating poverty 3 times before they mentioned co2, and by the end of the report they mention it 2 times as often. ANYONE that is trained on writing reports like that, know you always mention the most important facts first, and more often.

Every climate treaty has 3 things in common. 1) The US and other industrial nations pay huge amounts of money to the UN. 2) The UN decides who gets what money and of course they have a lot of people working for them and that means they have need for a large portion of that money. 3) When they give money, there is no need for it to be used in any thing that reduces co2.

A study done by Copenhagen Consensus Center shows that even if we spend 100 trillion dollars, it will have almost no effect.

The global frequency of major hurricanes has fallen rather than risen, F3+ tornadoes in the US have fallen in frequency. Wildfire burn area in the US has significantly fallen. What we consider extreme weather in modern times is not extreme. In pre-industrial times heatwaves dried up major rivers in Europe and killed millions. In the early 1900's Arctic explorers in Northern Europe were chased south by wildfires in the Arctic, which the media recently talked about as something new and caused by man-made climate.

10 to 25 C, we are OK without protection. -60 to + 60, we are done. Earth warming can do that, no problem at 600 ppm CO2. 350 ppm C02 is where we have to be to survive long term.

The environment is nothing but a chemical balance. It can wipe us out like it wiped the dinosaurs and be totally unaware it has done anything special.it is passive and reactive. It goes where it balances. If it is beyond our survival range as humans, it does not know it and it does not care. Life on the planet goes on, without us. 230 million years ago, the earth crust broke, CO2 escaped, the earth warmed 4 degrees C, it started raining, it rained for 2 million years, the famous CPE, Carnian Pluvial Event.  the dinosaurs were 5% of life at the start, 95% at the end. Did the Environment know or care? no. It wiped them 170 million years later, did it know or care? no. Do we think it cares if we survive or not? NO. Our fate is in our hands. We have the technology, let's do it. We have nothing to lose. We recapture the CO2 and use it. It was a threat, now it is a resource.

I knew you were young...but a ‘tween’??  Yeah....NO!  Your brain is only partially formed, LITERALLY.
Your comments about ‘life experience’ are especially telling.  

An adult knows that, although unique to each, honest Experience is the ONLY TRUE teacher.

1. Regarding CC, (or any controversial topic) ....SERIOUSLY, go to a library/librarian who can guide you to original data which can be compared to any misleading information currently being presented to you.  Only YOU can do the work.

2. Question everything!

Be Especially wary of people who use children to further their agenda.  
You are NOT TO ALLOW adults, or anyone, to play on your emotions.

3. When you are old enough, the quickest path to adulthood can be found by doing something like join the military, or even work with a charitable organization, away from home.

4. School is important, but it is often lacking in real world knowledge.  
Most of your instructors are lifelong ‘students’ just repeating stuff, mostly biased.  
The Majority of them can’t cut it outside of their incestuous BUBBLE....(filled with PC ‘Research’ Papers)!

They love stating the % concentration of CO2 as a strawman and then argue how can a small number be so bad? But it's a meaningless ratio where you divide a non precipitous GHG by the sum of O2, Nitrogen, and a little bit of Argon, none of which are GHG's. You may just as well divide by the number of stars in the sky or grains of sand at the beach. It's pointless, but they love the number. Comparing CO2 concentration to H20 is also a red herring because H20 is precipitous, it reaches a saturation point and then falls as rain. CO2 is only removed by organic processes, dissolving in sea water (leading to acidification of the surface skin), and chemically through the weathering of rocks. An average ICE car that gets 20 miles per gallon of gas produces about 1 lb of CO2 per year, drive it 12,000 miles per year and you just put 6 tons of CO2 into the atmosphere, some of which will remain for hundreds of thousands of years (the chart has a very long flat tail, after the biosphere sinks and ocean sinks stabilize the remainder is consumed from weathering rocks, which takes a looooong time). H20 is an important GHG, but the relationship between CO2 and H20 is best described as CO2 as being the volume control, the more CO2 the warmer the air gets & the more moisture it can hold so the warmer it gets.

But in the past, the climate would usually change at a rate that was slow enough for species to adapt and survive. It’s one of the factors that caused evolution. But if the climate changes too quickly, it could lead to major disasters. One example that’s far more extreme than even what we’ve been dealing with so far probably happened 66 million years ago, according to an article by National Geographic. A lot of people accept the possibility that the dinosaurs were killed by one of the many rocks floating in space, but most fictional depictions I’ve seen show the impact, as if that’s what killed all the dinosaurs and somehow left the smaller animals untouched. In reality, if it really was a meteor impact, it was probably all of the ash and debris filling the sky and blocking out the sun that killed the big planets, starving the big herbivores, and indirectly starving the big carnivores. That ended once the ash settled, so the small creatures feasting on the corpses of giants survived and evolved into the animals we know today. All of that happened over the course of tens of millions of years, so to say that the Earth was hotter hundreds of millions of years ago doesn’t say much.

https://www.gislounge.com/urban-heat-island-analysis/
As cities expand the Weather stations gets effected by the error known as Urban heat (well known to early scientists in the late 1800s). 
The Early scientists who were studying the weather, knew about these urban thermal islands and made sure that the early basic weather stations were upwind (with prevailing winds) in the rural areas from the cities. They also took note of wind direction at time of readings. Now if you map the locations of weather stations (and their relocations and other structures including hills etc with wind) and map the encroachment of Urban life around it over time. For example a bird nest attached to a weather station can effect the humidity and Temperature readings giving an offset in error. When occupied the heat rises and when teh reader go to the box the bird flies away. The heat is still been given off while the reader is reading. Also the humidity can be effected as it is evaporating from the bird nest, especially when it is been built. Also the Reader can effect very fine measurement reading by their very presence. Breading down or near the sensor can effect fine tune humidity readers. The heat from the body can cause the temperature reading to rise slightly. Care must be taken by the reader to be down wind of the instruments when taking reading, as a human being is a thermal island and a humidity island.

When you map the development/Economic status over time, you will noticed the rapid development in the 1960's onwards that corresponds with the rising heat. The 1980s drop in heat production with the economic depression. Same with the cooling with the latest great economic recession caused by government bail outs by taxing the people and cuts in spending stopping people from generating heat. Also Look at population growth in line with Thermal heat expenditure and the reduction of family size as people moved into a nuclear family homes and then the next stage, the separation of families (divorce) with Thermal expenditure.  If poor people had more money they burnt more fuel giving off heat. Poor people were often suffered from fuel poverty during economic recession/depressions, hence the lowering of temperature. Now map both together. Middle classes also reduce their heat footprint, which effect the weather stations.",UCqdtcZWOn2gN3v_JlX7bjbA,0.0,Ugzkcw0QXE0vjgsZ2Wl4AaABAg,fWInyaMWBY8,2012-03-07T17:10:33Z,climate crisis

In the excerpt we read for class today, Jefferson called for an American economy built on agriculture and to “let the work-shops” remain in Europe”. He recognized the need for some domestic industry but believed the vast land of America could be utilized by farming. Alexander Hamilton’s views contradicted Jefferson’s and his views on manufacturing and industry prevailed; consequently, America has progressed into a state of manufacturing rather than an agrarian state. This trend has become increasingly evident over time. Today, less than 2% of Americans farm. “Even though everyone still eats, taking part in the practice of growing food has less direct influence on people’s lives than at any point in our history (Hagenstein et al 3). Thus, we see the prevailing view of Alexander Hamilton as having profound impacts on the American economy and the global environment.

Thomas Jefferson adamantly advocated for the founding of this country to be based on agrarian ideals. Agrarianism supports working on land in ways that can last due to its focus on the interconnectedness of life (Freyfogle xix). Agrarians are sustainable and understand that humans need the Earth, land, and animals for our very subsistence. In the agrarian mindset, the health of humans is dependent in the long run on the well being of the larger land community (Freyfogle xix). Clearly, agrarian views dissent greatly from the views of the majority of modern people, especially those living in urban or suburban settings in the United States. Agrarians “believe that those who buy products are implicated morally in their production, just as those who discard waste items are morally involved in their final end… Producers and sellers, too, are morally responsible for their work, and in ways the market cannot absolve or cleanse when their products are sold”. Of course, one cannot live in a place without altering it, however, agrarians are about harmonizing their relationship and effect on nature, not exploiting it. From these readings, I came to be constantly asking myself the same question, “If Thomas Jefferson’s agrarian ideology prevailed, would we still be in the current state of environmental degradation we are currently in?",UC03hToU5v2hGFevHWrrBESw,0.0,Ugz1hCUtO8WaFkaFE_l4AaABAg,fWInyaMWBY8,2012-03-07T17:10:33Z,climate crisis

Average Global Temperature was 5'c higher. +14'c in the Arctic, +7'c in the Antarctic. All the ice melted in the Arctic and the whole of Western Antarctica melted along with some of Eastern Antarctica. Sea levels were 25m higher. Our crops will fail because the large land areas dry out with GAT at 16'c. Many species are stressed at 16'c. Corals will not survive, phytoplankton will crash. They are the base of the food chain and produce 50% of the Oxygen on earth. At 16'c trees and other plants will start to die off. They produce the other 50% of our Oxygen. Measurements already detect lower Oxygen levels both in the Ocean and our Atmosphere. At 18'c most of our natural habitat fails to cope or adapt and a mass die off is inevitable. We cannot live without our habitat. That's where we get all our food and water. At 18'c shallow sea shelves full of Methane Hydrate dissolve, this causes further warming to 22-23'c.

The population of the world keeps growing and we are becoming more and more able to feed a larger percentage of those people. More people are rising out of poverty everyday. Climate change doesn’t seem to be a problem and until all those scientists can demonstrate that they understand the climate, which I don’t believe the do, and can predict anything that climate hysterics are claiming, people who aren’t scientists won’t have a reason to listen.

Increasing Carbon Dioxide into the atmosphere will, with absolute certainty increase the temperature of the Earth, you can read about it here http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/EnergyBalance/page7.php

Humans are adding an unprecedented amount of Carbon Dioxide into the atmosphere. We know the source of Carbon Dioxide by the isotope ratios. Carbon-13 is a stable isotope of Carbon. Plants do not absorb much Carbon-13 because it takes more energy for them to use. This means that plants have less Carbon-13 than the atmosphere. If we see the percentage of Carbon-13 in the atmosphere falling we know for certain that the source is plant material. Oil and coal are ancient plants we know for certain that burning coal and oil is the source of atmospheric Carbon Dioxide. You can read about it here https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/outreach/isotopes/stable.html

It periodically releases this pent up energy over time then returns to a more normal state. This causes both short term and long term changes in the amount of energy given off by the sun. To monitor solar radiation we put a satellite into orbit between Earth and the Sun called SOHO  You can look up information about SOHO here https://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov
Because we monitor solar output constantly we know for certain that modern warming is not caused by the sun. While solar output has been declining recently, the temperature has continued to rise. However the sun is responsible for some warming trends in the past.

The Earth is pulled in its orbit by the other planets. They tug on it over time and slightly change its orbit. The Earth's orbit around the sun is not a perfect circle but an ellipse. This change in Earth's orbit causes energy from the sun to hit the planet in different ways over time. This change in how the Earth orbits the sun causes long term changes in Earth's climate. This is called the Millankovitch Cycle. You can read about MIlankovitch Cycles here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles
When the sun heats up the oceans the oceans release carbon dioxide. This carbon dioxide causes a feedback loop where the temperature rises even higher than the Milankovitch Cycle would have alone. Most changes in the climate prior to humans were caused by either changes in solar radiation and the Milankovitch Cycle. Milankovitch Cycles are over long time periods of 22,000 to 400,000 years. We know for certain that the Milankovitch Cycle is not responsible for modern warming. It does not make abrupt changes in climate we have seen in the last 100 years. However Milankovitch Cyles are primarily responsible for changes in the climate in the past.

In addition the ocean is currently absorbing Carbon Dioxide despite the fact that it's warming. You can read about the ocean absorbing Carbon Dioxide here http://pmel.noaa.gov/co2/story/Ocean+Acidification
This has never happened in the entire Quaternary. The ocean has never, in the last 2.5 million years warmed and absorbed Carbon Dioxide at the same time. This is unnatural.",UCVLtQdIIMIt0uhf_CHE5ehQ,1.0,UgjNbY1KfSRGEngCoAEC,fWInyaMWBY8,2012-03-07T17:10:33Z,climate crisis

Samuel Myers, a senior research scientist at Harvard’s School of Public Health, has published groundbreaking studies on how rising CO2 levels lower the nutritional quality of foods that we eat, like rice, wheat, and maize, which lose significant amounts of zinc, iron, and protein when grown under higher concentrations of CO2. Plant composition depends on a balance between air, soil, and water. As CO2, the source of carbon for plant growth, proliferates quickly in the atmosphere, soil nutrients — such as nitrogen, iron, and magnesium — remain the same.

Your correct, it cannot. But don't underestimate how much less energy is needed if each house has solar panels, even in a country that spans the arctic circle like I live in you get a lot of electricity, in particular during the time when you got your AC running.

My point is just, don't dissuade from solar panels, talk about how to improve the effect of them. Btw, we have nuclear power here too, combined with lots of river power, wind and solar. Not a coal or petrol power plant to be seen. Our government is trying to get more and more incentives out so the population can, and wants, to install solar cells on roofs.

Diversifying the electricity profile is important to avoid sudden power outages.

""Their[sic] aren't enough mountains and valleys that we can spare""
Converting water into hydrogen to store electricity is a sane approach on some scales, houses and cars for instance. Proven safer than petrol (at least by the companies that are pioneering the cars and gas containers).

As a side benefit, releasing extra oxygen into the atmosphere would (at a drop of water in the ocean level) slightly reduce the green house effect by diluting the CO2 concentration.",UCU0c9b4uYk3GlKM085M3lIA,1.0,UgjmuFXuRLLe1XgCoAEC,fWInyaMWBY8,2012-03-07T17:10:33Z,climate crisis

Fossil fuels are only cheap because of the $500 billion/year subsidy the world pays outside of the price of the fuels from the pollution, national security, health effects, accidents, ocean acidification and climate change they cause.  

Putting a fee on the fuels simply accounts for those negative costs to society, and makes fossil fuels compete on a more equal footing with other energy options.  Returning all the money collected (minus administration costs of a few percent a year) protects our purchasing power, and the economy.  

The Citizens' Climate Lobby proposal is to do this with a steadily increasing fee rather than all at once, so the market can do what you say and provide the solutions over time.

We still need to sequester the extra already in the atmosphere. But by far there is plenty of room in our highly degraded agricultural soils to hold every bit of the extra CO2 in the atmosphere and restore the balance.

It wasn't that long ago that people thought flight and space travel were impossible but the science and technology advanced and we got to where we are now. The point isn't necessarily what you're trying to make it out to be. Yes science along with many things can have discrepancies but that doesn't negate the overwhelming majority truth of the facts. The point is the poorest/least well off of us in the world will be the first to feel and suffer the worst impacts... so whether or not your grandkids are smart or ignorant their skills of shooting, fishing, or whatever survival intelligence you believe will hold up against extreme natural disasters or drastic changes to the environment (which you clearly seem to enjoy) in the future are irrelevant and fall under a false sense of security because it will be hard to fish in a sea that is so warm the acidity level has killed the fish and it breeds the all too familiar flesh eating bacteria that has already become more and more of an issue/danger in many American fishing areas and killed quite a few fisherman already. Not to mention declining vegetation will throw off the natural balance of animals so that will ultimately become an issue for hunting if that is your fall back...so not quite sure how their survival intelligence helps there. Not only that but natural disasters of flooding and drought; pollution; dangerous bacteria; diseases; etc. these are all things that impact people equally whether they are intelligent or not. So if we know we can do things that are better for us all (even if you don't believe in climate change) in a less polluting/cleaner and more eco friendly way why not take that route instead of refusing to progress? If we had thought that way we wouldn't have airplanes, vaccines/medicines, automobiles, computers, boats, and even guns or the advanced and better quality of weapons that we all have the luxury of enjoying in our country. We all are responsible for our actions in life and the impact we have left behind will be our legacy. So while maybe you don't care or want to care and thus choose avoidance or denial so as to maintain your bubble of your world view is your choice and right but choosing to ignore a growing reality is like denying the air you breathe exists because you can't see it and refuse to acknowledge its very existence.

Completely irrelevant, that's what.  Maybe you should learn what drives ice age cycles.  Milankovitch forces act on time scales of tens of thousands of years.  By those forces alone, we'd be cooling right now, as we were for 5,000 years until the climate did a screeching 180 starting in about 1900 due to fossil fuel emissions.  Now of course we're warming faster than ever in human history.

It accumulates in the atmosphere. This same ignorant decision, as the Kyoto Protocol.
Lima. Environmental Summit. December 2014: ""However, for the first time in the history of climate negotiations there was approved by all 195 parties to the negotiation process a document that commitments to reduce emissions are willing to take not only developed but also developing countries."" Details: http://kommersant.ru/doc/2634202.
Leaders of 195 countries took the initiative and decided to reduce emissions by 5% per year, and begin their decline in 2015??  I stand for the ""wisdom"" of the political, environmental agencies and research groups 195 states:
2015. Greenhouse gases 2014 have not gone away - they have remained in the atmosphere.
So, in 2015, left in the atmosphere: 100% gas 2014 2015 + 95%.
In 2016, in the atmosphere is 100% of greenhouse gas emissions in 2014, + 95% for 2015 and 2016.
In 2017 in the atmosphere would be 100% 2014 + 95% 2015, 2016 and 2017. And so on.
Natural disasters will grow annually by 95% and reduced by 5%. And this ""reduction"" will last approximately 1000-1200 years.
Hence, in the bunkers, which have recently been building the elite, will be hard to survive even 3-5 years - a thousand years, it is impossible to live in bunkers.
I also inform you that endless conversations officials do not understand the principles of ecological processes will not remove warming. 
Warming can be eliminated only by qualified environmental-engineers.

Ещё раз сообщаю чиновникам ООН, США, Франции, Германии, Австралии: Убрать углекислый газ из атмосферы за счёт сокращения выбросов с земли невозможно. Он накапливается в атмосфере. Это такое же безграмотное решение, как Киотский протокол. 
Лима. Экологический саммит. Декабрь 2014: «Тем не менее впервые в истории климатических переговоров появился утвержденный всеми 195 сторонами переговорного процесса документ, в котором обязательства по снижению выбросов готовы взять на себя не только развитые, но и развивающиеся страны». Подробнее: http://kommersant.ru/doc/2634202.
Руководство 195 стран проявило инициативу и приняло решение сократить выбросы по 5% в год, и начать их сокращение в 2015 году??? Расшифровываю эту «мудрость» политических, экологических структур и научных коллективов 195 государств: 
2015 год. Парниковые газы 2014 года никуда не делись – они остались в атмосфере.  
Значит, в 2015 году в атмосфере осталось: 100% газов 2014 + 95% 2015. 
В 2016 году в атмосфере будет: 100% парниковых газов 2014, + по 95% 2015 и 2016. 
В 2017 в атмосфере окажется: 100% 2014, + 95% 2015, 2016 и 2017. И так далее.
Природные катаклизмы будут расти ежегодно на 95%, а уменьшаться на 5%. И такое «снижение» продлится примерно 1000-1200 лет. 
Отсюда, в бункерах, которые в последнее время строит вся элита, будет тяжело прожить даже 3-5 лет – тысячу лет в бункерах прожить невозможно. 
Я также сообщаю, что бесконечные разговоры чиновников, не понимающих принципы действия экологических процессов, потепления не устранят. Потепление могут устранить только квалифицированные инженеры-экологи.

Eliminating warming through the use of natural techniques:
Due to the production of fresh water. -
Watered in dry and junk territory. -
Gross weight gain green: grass, shrubs and trees. -
And most importantly, due to the recovery and growth of ocean plankton.
Technologies used:
First. Production of fresh water in volumes of tens of cubic kilometers per year. I use water production in large rivers. Working person. Work is moderately expensive, up to 60% of the total cost of the program. As an example I give the production of fresh water in the Nile River, and benefits from the event.
Second. Watering in dry and wastelands. No problem. Water is supplied to the arid areas of the rivers, streams, or sleeves, or in the newly built channels. Working person. Work is moderately expensive, up to 20% of the cost of the program.
Third. Gross planting and growth of green matter: grass, shrubs and trees. Working person. Work is moderately expensive, up to 20%.
Job natural technologies.
Grass covers the soil. Locked soil reduces emissions of warm or hot air, and reduces its heating. And de facto become permanent now cooling the atmosphere. Example. Bare and in the summer the soil is heated from 40 to 60-70 degrees in the desert. The ground, covered with grass - about 20 degrees. Averaged emissions of hot air into the atmosphere is reduced to 2-3 times, or 200-300%. Nature Works. Free.
The destruction of carbon dioxide. Statistics:
""One hectare of forest adult consumes annually up to 6.5 tons of carbon dioxide and emits 5 tons of oxygen."" 1,000 hectares will be removed from the atmosphere by 6500 tons of carbon dioxide, a million - 6.5 six million, and so on, and so every year. Ready technology for the destruction of atmospheric carbon dioxide and eliminate warming. Powered by nature. Free.
More. ""One hectare of green plants absorb 60 tons of dust and cleaned of contaminants 18 million cubic meters of air."" This is 70% finished treatment plants! All connections will remove the light of nature, man will remove heavy. Powered by nature. Free.
More. ""It produces about 2 tons of volatile production - essential oils, resins, aromatics, balsam and other little studied therapeutic essential connections."" It is natural for the Human Health Factory, especially the reproductive parts of the community - women and children "". Powered by nature. Free.
The above-mentioned technologies cooled creeks, sleeves and rivers. Nature Works. Free.
Chilled and bleached rivers carry their water in the seas and oceans. Nature Works. Free.
The waters of the oceans gradually cooled, resulting in a gain of ocean plankton. Nature Works. Free.
Hence, the conditions under which the ocean removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere are made and it will be displayed from the atmosphere and will eventually withdrawn. And as a confirmation of what has been said to give two quotations: ""Ocean during heating increases the emissions of carbon dioxide, and when cooled - removes it from the atmosphere."" And another quote: ""The ocean plankton withdraws from the air three times, four times more carbon dioxide than all the world's forests."" Nature Works. Free.

Устранение потепления за счёт использования природных технологий: 
За счёт производства пресной воды. – 
Обводнения засушливых и бросовых территорий. – 
Валового прироста зелёной массы: травы, кустарников и деревьев. – 
И главное, за счёт восстановления и прироста океанского планктона. 
Используемые технологии:
Первое. Производство пресной воды в объёмах десятков куб км в год. Я использую производство воды в крупных реках. Работает Человек. Работа умеренно затратная, до 60% общей стоимости программы. Как пример даю производство пресной воды в реке Нил, и выгоды от этого мероприятия.
Второе. Обводнение засушливых и бросовых земель. Никаких проблем. Вода подаётся на засушливые территории по рекам, рукавам или ручьям, или во вновь построенным каналам. Работает Человек. Работа умеренно затратная, до 20% стоимости программы. 
Третье. Валовая высадка и прирост зелёной массы: травы, кустарников и деревьев. Работает Человек. Работа умеренно затратная, до 20%. 
Работа природных технологий. 
Трава закрывает почву. Закрытая почва уменьшает выбросы в атмосферу тёплого или горячего воздуха, и уменьшает её нагрев. И де-факто становится постоянно действующим предприятием по охлаждению атмосферы. Пример. Оголённая почва летом нагревается от 40 до 60-70 градусов в пустынях. Почва, закрытая травой – порядка 20 градусов. Усреднённые выбросы в атмосферу горячего воздуха в атмосферу снижаются до 2-3 раз, или на 200-300%. Работает Природа. Бесплатно.
По уничтожению углекислого газа. Статистика:
«Один гектар взрослого леса уничтожает ежегодно до 6,5 тонн углекислого газа и выделяет 5 тонн кислорода». 1000 га уберут из атмосферы 6,5 тысяч тонн углекислоты, миллион – 6,5 шесть миллионов, и так далее, и так каждый год. Готовая технология по уничтожению из атмосферы углекислого газа и устранения потепления. Работает природа. Бесплатно.
Ещё. «Один гектар зеленых насаждений поглощает 60 тонн пыли и очищает от вредных примесей 18 миллионов кубометров воздуха». Это на 70% готовые очистные сооружения! Все лёгкие соединения уберёт Природа, человеку останется убрать тяжёлые. Работает природа. Бесплатно.
Ещё. «Производит порядка 2 тонн фитонцидов – эфирных масел, смол, ароматических веществ, бальзама и прочих мало исследованных лечебных эфирных соединений». Это природная Фабрика Здоровья для Человека, и особенно воспроизводящей части сообщества – Женщин и Детей». Работает природа. Бесплатно.
Названные выше технологии охлаждают ручьи, рукава и реки. Работает Природа. Бесплатно. 
Охлаждённые и осветлённые реки несут свои воды в моря и океаны. Работает Природа. Бесплатно. 
Воды Мирового океана постепенно охлаждаются, что приводит к приросту океанского планктона. Работает Природа. Бесплатно.
Отсюда, условия, при которых океан изымает углекислоту из атмосферы выполнены, и она из атмосферы будет выводиться и будет в конечном счёте выведена. И как подтверждение сказанного даю две цитаты: «Океан при нагревании увеличивает выбросы в атмосферу углекислого газа, а при охлаждении – изымает его из атмосферы». И ещё цитата: «Океанский планктон изымает из атмосферы втрое-вчетверо больше углекислоты, чем все леса планеты». Работает Природа. Бесплатно.

Getting it out of the atmosphere is pretty damn' difficult, but there's another step. With heat, drive the carbon dioxide out of chalk or limestone calcium carbonate and into your mechanism to combine it chemically with underground rocks.

About your remark on the only way to deal with the CO2 increase by reforestation, I don't think that's enough. I'm reading through the Assessment Reports from the IPCC about our state and where we are and where we're going and I'm not finished reading them but as far back as 1990 it was estimated that forests only account for reducing something like 30% of the extra CO2 we've added to the atmosphere.

The resulting increase of CO2 can only be dealt with by vast amounts of regeneration of forests and other phototrophs.
But further increase can be slowed and stopped by replacing carbon combustion with nuclear fission.
In the whole world, since the invention of civilian reactors, there have been three nuclear meltdowns, of which exactly one caused a non-speculative number of deaths.
The USA has experimentally demonstrated two technologies that have idiot-proof immunity to breakdown. Russia has an 800 MWe reactor using fast neutrons, continuously breeding fissile fuel from common uranium 238, and even so inferior to the design that the Clinton administration abandoned.

Yes, all of science is a big plot against you personally, and every single scientist in the world is in on it (except for the few who make arguments you like).

That's the first lesson. Then we spend 5 years learning how to fabricate data (you'd think it would be faster, but it's really difficult apparently).

So lets put you back to bed.

Mars and Venus have the same concentrations of Co2.

Both planets have atmospheric CO2 concentrations around 95%. Earth’s atmosphere has only 0.04% CO2. The density of CO2 in both planet’s atmospheres is much higher than Earth’s atmosphere.
 
Temperatures on Venus average a balmy 467°C, but temperatures on Mars average a nippy −63 °C. Why the big difference?
 

According to the “runaway CO2 greenhouse” theory, both planets should be really hot. Mars is twice as far away from the Sun, so its top of atmosphere receives only 25% of the solar radiation as Venus. But clouds on Venus reflect 75% of the sunlight – so the SW radiation flux at the surface is similar on the two planets.
 
So why is Venus hot and Mars cold? Simple – it is the atmospheric pressure.
 
The pressure on Venus is nearly one thousand times higher than on Mars. As the atmosphere convects, descending gases warm and ascending gases cool. The amount of warming is determined primarily by the increase in pressure.
 
Ever used a bicycle pump? Why does it get hot?
 
Answer : Because you are doing work to the gas when you compress it. Similarly, solar radiation transfers energy to the atmosphere, causing convection and heating of sinking air. If there was no Sun, the atmosphere would be very cold and would in fact freeze.
 
The runaway greenhouse theory makes little sense. If it were true, the Earth would experience it from water vapour, not CO2. H2O is a much stronger greenhouse gas than CO2, is much more abundant than CO2 and gets released from the oceans very easily and often – particularly as the planet heats up.",UC56pIBoI2RCtWTCiAEF61ww,1.0,Ugh5pNe-RtmFyngCoAEC,fWInyaMWBY8,2012-03-07T17:10:33Z,climate crisis

It's because Venus' atmosphere is primarily made from carbon dioxide (the greenhouse gas we are emitting.)

IPCC: Despite hiatus, climate change here to stay
Global warming will be irreversible for centuries, latest report warns.

''A slowdown in the rise of global average temperatures in recent years suggests that global warming is proceeding more intermittently, and less predictably, than it does in some climate models. But the 'hiatus' since the record hot year of 1998 — probably due to increased heat uptake by the oceans — is no sign that global warming has stopped, as some would like to hope''

Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) say 2012 was the ninth warmest year since 1880, continuing a long-term trend of rising global temperatures. The ten warmest years in the 132-year record have all occurred since 1998. The average global temperature has increased 0.8°C (1.4°F) since 1880, and most of that change has occurred in the past four decades.

Well, what is ""really happening"" is that CO2 levels are increasing and  they show an anthropogenic signature, not a model. Temps are increasing while the primary climate driver, solar forcing, is in a low state of energy; again this is not a model, these are metrics.

 Europe got clobbered: Over the past two weeks, temperatures in Eastern Europe have nose-dived to -30 degrees Celsius (-22 degrees Fahrenheit). Blizzards and the bone-chilling cold have resulted in the deaths of over 550 people so far, with rooftop-high snow drifts trapping tens of thousands of villagers in their homes and cutting off access to entire towns. It has even snowed as far south as North Africa.

I live in Toronto Ontario Canada, normally we have pretty mild winters, with very little snow, lasting usually from about November until mid-March. But over the past few years I winters have become so much colder and longer, if the globe is indeed warming up, how does that relate to North America being so much colder and below normal for so many years? I have friends and many major American cities, and they all say this is happening in their cities as well, so where is the connection between global warming and freezing cold weather? It seems like a bit of an oxymoron to me, granted I am not a scientist, and to be honest I know very little about the inner workings of global warming, can somebody who has factual evidence please fill me in on why it’s so cold here? Last summer, actually last spring was one unlike any other way of seeing before. The Great Lakes flooded everywhere, including here in Toronto. I lived in the city for all of my 49 years and I’ve never seen anything like it, the Toronto Islands, which are a small group of islands in the Toronto harbour area, which is a public park, was close for most of the summer because the islands were under several feet of water, destroying almost everything on the island, causing hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenue and damage. It just doesn’t make any sense to me how all this connects to global warming.I have a friend that lives in Yellowknife, which is in the far Canadian North, she told me that it’s been absolutely freezing, and for the last 10 years the winters have been colder than I have ever experienced before, if that is so, then how is it that global warming exists? If what the sciences say about global warming or true, cities like yellow knife, should be having much warmer winters with much less snow and much more melting ice, yet the opposite is happening. Is there any possibility that global warming is a cyclical event that is common place to the planet earth. We humans have only been on this world for A few minutes when compared to the actual age of our planet, and even with our most advanced scientific resources, how can we truly tell what the past cycles freeze and thaw have been like? I know there are some studies to suggest that we tried several ice ages, so with that in mind, unless there was a civilization before us that we don’t know about, is it possible that all these events or nature doing what it does best, changing constantly with or without mankind interference? Like I said, I’m definitely not denying anything, I’m just extremely puzzled because what the scientist or telling us and what is really happening are so far apart it makes it very difficult to believe what they’re saying is true. Does anybody have any evidence, make that concrete evidence, that we are truly responsible for global warming,Or is mother nature responsible for this drastic change in our weather? I just like to know the truth, I’m not denying more confirming anything until I know more. I’ve learned throughout my mini years on this earth to never trust anybody or anything without having hard factual evidence to back it up, because everybody has their own agenda.",UCdZ1MP4cmd3Es9psNqelOUQ,0.0,UgzR55C-5QHOEQQBY2l4AaABAg,eB7xJ23E1t0,2018-01-04T01:30:20Z,climate crisis

Ozone production occurs when the suns rays make contact with Oxygen. The reason there isn't much ozone over the arctic is because 6 months a year is total darkness, and when there is sunlight, there is not much oxygen due to the lack of plants. Then they said Co2 was rising up and causing a canopy that trapped the heat and prevented it from escaping into space. They failed to mention that Co2 is heavier than air and cannot float up, but sinks down to ground level, but science doesn't mean anything to these idiots. When we started having record cold winters, the global warmers started looking stupid, so they changed their theory to climate change. It was no longer global warming, but climate change with extreme heat and extreme cold. Wait a minute, they're saying that a canopy of Co2 is trapping the earth's heat from escaping and this causes extreme cold? So the Co2 canopy takes a vacation in the winter and allows the heat to escape, causing extreme cold, but it returns in the summer? Co2 is not pollution, it's plant food and God made it heavier than air, so that it hovers near the ground to feed the plants. Co2 has a specific gravity of 1.5 while air has a specific gravity of 1.0. It is a scientific impossibility for Co2 to rise up and form a canopy. We have warmings in the US for people going into caves and underground storm drains for the risk of suffocation from elevated Co2 levels that displace the air. Look at dry ice, which is frozen Co2, and watch how it hovers near the ground when it warms and turns into a gas. Type in the you tube search ""Co2 is heavier than air demonstration"" and you'll see an elementary school science demonstration that shows it's impossible for Co2 to rise up.",UCDqymwlghfFHA8scMSE_8dQ,0.0,Ugy-_ZYcfKSW2Gt61fF4AaABAg,eB7xJ23E1t0,2018-01-04T01:30:20Z,climate crisis

Harvey wasn't ""holding"" more water.  That's not how hurricanes work.  The water they rain down is fed from the ocean.  The storm stalled over land, and continued to suck up moisture from the gulf instead of coming all the way on land and fading out.  The ensuing rain was concentrated on a relatively small part of Texas around Houston.  Combine that with piss-poor, out of date drainage system in the Houston area and you have a bad combination.  Houston floods on a regular basis, that's nothing new, it's one of the most flood prone cities in the U.S..

Global warming just means more extreme weather. Meaning when it gets cold it get really fucking cold and when it gets hot you have the dangers of forest fires due to a lack of Jungles. 
The earth gets dry due to a lack of Mushrooms and Moss on top of the soil. This will help the earth to keep moisture which prevents forest fires. Furthermore forests produce rain clouds by evaporating water so plants can grow further Land Inwards.  The plants prevent the wind from forming tornadoes etc.

So basically the problem is environmental polution and removing the forests and native animals from their habitat.

It doesn't automatically mean that it's wrong by any means, but it's not proofed or a fact like many people think.

272,Ugz9rCVbXrNNdImp2dd4AaABAg,0.0,0.0,2018-02-04T09:37:18Z,PfropfNo1,"You can't compare gravity to climate.
- 1: gravity was and is been examined in numerous experiments for hundreds of years. The results in experiments are reproducible, so we even have exact Formulars to calculate the force of gravity, even if we never tried that experiment. There is only one climate, you can not do experiments, redo them and see if you get the same results.  Models that tried to predict the future climate have failed, there is no Formular to calculate climate. It's much much less understood than gravity.

- 2: there is no alternative explanation for gravity (I don't count ""God"" as a viable or theory), while there is for climate change and co2-temperature correlation in the past: if water heats up, it will release the gas. Maybe you noticed that warm beer or warm soda has much less gas. So if earth heats up, oceans would release co2 and co2 in atmosphere increases. So the correlation from the past, which is like the main Argument, ist not for sure.

3: a reasonable amount of scientists doesn't agree to humans being the cause. 88% do agree, while those who agree publish much more papers, which is why studies that just count the amount of papers get wrong numbers of 97%. Some people compare climate change more to religion than science, because people who not believe in it will be excluded from society. So people who don't agree don't publish papers, to not lose reputation and the question is, if the 88% is correct even. That's a psychological phenomenon. In switzerland almost twice of people voted against mosque in a plebiscite, than they admitted when asked for a study. (Trumps election  is another example, people often just say, what they think others expect from them)

4: actually there are even doubts about gravity or phenomena that can't be explained with it. For example the universe accelerates to expand, while by our  understanding of gravity the expansion should slow down, stop and inverse at some point of time. It's like you throw a ball to  the sky, but instead of falling down it keeps getting faster flying upwards.

Solar radiation has been in slow decline since the 1970s, and we've seen the rapid warming since that time.
Volcanic aerosols cannot account for it. 

Allmof these studies support the consensus: Anderegg 2010, Doran 2009, Oreskes 2004, Cook 2013, Verheggen 2014, Stenhouse 2014, Carlton 2015
We can also see the consensus in the fact that every single established academy of science, including the American Institute of Physics, that takes a position on man-made climate change, accepts that it's real and that it carries major risks to society.

*American Physical Society*
""The evidence is incontrovertible: Global warming is occurring. If no mitigating actions are taken, significant disruptions in the Earth’s physical and ecological systems, social systems, security and human health are likely to occur. We must reduce emissions of greenhouse gases beginning now."" (November 2007)

*American Association for the Advancement of Science: AAAS*
""The scientific evidence is clear: global climate change caused by human activities is occurring now, and it is a growing threat to society."" (December 2006)

*American Chemical Society*
""There is now general agreement among scientific experts that the recent warming trend is real (and particularly strong within the past 20 years), that most of the observed warming is likely due to increased atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, and that climate change could have serious adverse effects by the end of this century."" (July 2004)

*U.S. National Academy of Sciences*
""The scientific understanding of climate change is now sufficiently clear to justify taking steps to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere."" (2005)

*International academies: Joint science academies’ statement*
""Climate change is real. There will always be uncertainty in understanding a system as complex as the world’s climate. However there is now strong evidence that significant global warming is occurring."" (2005, 11 national academies of science)

*International academies*
""Despite increasing consensus on the science underpinning predictions of global climate change, doubts have been expressed recently about the need to mitigate the risks posed by global climate change. We do not consider such doubts justified."" (2001, 16 national academies of science)

His job security did not depend on his findings.   
so when you say ""the more data I find for X the more money the government pay me to do more research into it"" makes no sense for 2 reasons.  
1) Less can be More - in my dads case, the less of X (Tuna) could result in more funding.  
2) I don't get it - If there were less tuna and the government saw this as a problem and splashed out new round of funding, my dad would get none of it.  it would go to another scientist who will conduct experiments to find a solution.  
3) I still get paid - My dad was paid to just count the number of fish.  If the numbers are high or low, it didn't matter, he still got paid.  
4) Accuracy is Everything - the one thing that could get him fired, is if his numbers were not accurate.  His PhD was in pure mathematics.    He went to extraordinary lengths to make sure his numbers were right.  He would fly in statisticians to make sure the numbers were right before he published his results.
5) Scientist can criticise the government and keep their jobs. - My dad in the 80s disagreed with the Australian governments fishing policy and industry practices at the time.   After that, he worked for the government for another 30 years and was given awards by the fishing industry because his work was accurate.

CO2 in the ice core record is effectively a proxy of ocean temperature, which is why it lags by hundreds of years.  Because of this you can't infer anything about CO2's impact on temperature from the CO2 levels in the ice core data.  You could even assume negative forcing from CO2 and so long as natural variation made temperatures fluctuate in the same way...CO2 would follow suit.

And BTW, this is why temperatures aren't showing anything remotely close to the response necessary to justify a statement like you made.

I do not proclaim to know the mechanics behind climate change. (and I do read scientific papers on it) There is indeed still debate on what causes climate change, to what extent the climate is changing, what the consequences are (just rising temperature and sea level is a outdated view on climate change) and what is causing the change. But that doesnt change the fact that climate change is real. The reason I can say this is because the climate is changing in such a way that it heavily affects foodcrops on global scale. (I am no expert in climate studies, but I am a expert in agriculture)

The ''myth'' that scientists agree is one of the most contested claims of the whole debate. Now, a lot of scientist that make up the ''its less than 97%'' claims do not have climate change as their field of expertise. It is easy to scew the % by including or excluding scientists from different fields. Someone can be great at physics, and know jack shit about the rather subtle enviromental changes as a result of climate change.

""Argueing against climate change""
That's the most common trick to discredit skeptics, change their argument a little bit to make them look stupid. No one is arguing against climate change, some people are arguing if human caused the change or not and/or if it's really that terrible. A common myth is that climate never has changed so fast, which is wrong [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abrupt_climate_change]. Another common myth is that 97% of scientists agree. The people who claim that just count scientific papers and check if they agree or not. For 2 reasons that's not accurate and scientist who agree just publish more. 1st the media created the myth that it's a fact and everyone who argues against it must be an idiot. Publishing a paper that Doesn't agree will kill your reputation. 2nd there is conveying money if you sign  up a study related to global warming. Still most scientists agree but the true number is around 60-88%. So 12-40% deny a significant human influence (depending on source and how ""deny"" is defined) which is a decent controversable topic, unlike media represents it.

Also keep in mind science is not democracy. The majority was wrong in the past several times, which of course doesn't proof that the minority is right. But it shows it's possible that the minority is right. But most random guys that watched 2 documentaries suddenly are experts and know everything about climate...",UCwspAmiNJfnTClW218tpsgg,1.0,UgxrIsGB2hHYu4bz_y54AaABAg,eB7xJ23E1t0,2018-01-04T01:30:20Z,climate crisis

GMO trees would be great for sequestering carbon as ~60 of CO2 sequestered by trees goes into the roots/soil. While yes they would eventually decay, this would not be for decades or even a century possibly. And yes there’s other technologies that could potentially sequester more carbon indefinitely, but I believe that the key is using a multitude of these ideas/innovations. There’s ultimately no silver bullet besides cooperating as a whole with other people. My suggestion, invest in threes technologies, conserve and maintain forests and ecosystems as much as possible, work on investing in green power generation/heat generation as well as supplemental technologies, and lots more, but that’s just my quick suggestion",UCbyTJ2nuUjZnguVUbMxMWXg,0.0,UgzWyLs1Ff97I6ysngt4AaABAg,odOjMzgb5T8,2021-01-31T17:59:49Z,climate crisis

Wildlife conservationists are starting to think about using GMOs to protect endangered species. what if there was a flu that was going to kill off the koalas, would you not give them medicine? or is that playing God too much. not doing anything isn't conservation it's the bystander effect, it's having the ability to pull the switch and choosing not to. this isn't Jurassic park where we are bringing back a species that no longer has a niche, this is us stopping trees from dying in their early years. this isn't playing god this is us trying to fix our mistakes and taking ownership",UCcae-JzEEuRy5QXu5jbd7Ng,1.0,UgwItq0mT-DgUS_S1KN4AaABAg,odOjMzgb5T8,2021-01-31T17:59:49Z,climate crisis
