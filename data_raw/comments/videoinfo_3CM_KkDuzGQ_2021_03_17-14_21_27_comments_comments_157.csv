It's so hard to find both objective and easy to understand sources that explain the science behind global warming as well as this video, which I think is a really great shame, media like this is simply made to be shared, and in this age the good that it could do would just be magnified on social media, I mean, think of how much awareness this one video has the potential to raise on the issue! Sorry if my suggestions were a little long winded, it's just that content like yours on this issue seems extremely rare (and I have to wonder why ...) and I just find it frustrating that I find it difficult to find all the sources I would like to learn more about global warming summarized in one place, let alone in a format that's as easy to understand as this fantastic piece here.

But I have some caveats here: <br /><br />A minor one: methane from permafrost melt only lasts in the atmosphere for 12 years, so won&#39;t be much of a climate force over time.<br /><br />A major one: solar and wind aren&#39;t reliable replacements because we can&#39;t store the energy for use when it&#39;s dark and cloudy or calm, respectively. Storage technologies are an enormous bugbear and while I&#39;m fond of some of the solution ideas, especially flywheel banks and EnergyNest&#39;s thermal storage, these things are far from ready to deploy en masse. Battery storage isn&#39;t catching up fast at anywhere near the rate we need. I suggest you look harder at this.<br /><br />And a huge solution element you miss is the decentralisation of population through 3D printing and augmented reality. We can already 3D print houses, clothes, tools and food. With augmented reality, we will no longer need to centralise housing to run our organizations or fuel mass transport from hub to hub. And with 3D printed food - from vats of stem cells - we will no longer need to use most of our land for agriculture. So we&#39;ll rapidly spread out into villages across the former farmlands and present day cities will become museums over the next two generations.<br /><br />Provided climate change disruptions don&#39;t wreck us all first.",UCBZuAZiW7L78ZZpda6FNBug,0,Uggd5Wpccyv-eHgCoAEC,3CM_KkDuzGQ,2017-04-08 19:53:48

Pumped hydro storage doesn't presently scale very well above the needs of a small town. There's a nice treatment of it at http://physics.ucsd.edu/do-the-math/2011/11/pump-up-the-storage/ . Nevertheless, http://www.gravitypower.net/ looks like a good way to deal with that. Another solution that looks promising is http://www.energy-nest.com/home/ . Both these technologies are in their infancy, but there are commercial pilots for both and in principal I can see no obstacles to scaling. 3D printed food from stem cells is further from commercial reality. http://www.nbcnews.com/mach/innovation/lab-grown-meat-may-save-lot-more-farm-animals-lives-n743091 is a recent summary of progress. I think it's fair to regard full commercial scale for it as a decade away. The same probably goes for full scale commercial 3D-printed buildings. Full augmented reality is closer. 5G wireless networks already pack sufficient bandwidth for it - tens of gigbits per second - and the first practical AR goggles - MS Hololens - are already on the market. Within 5 years AR will be commonplace in a sunglasses form factor and in a decade mobile phones will look as quaint to the kids as wall-tethered phones do today. So ... all these technologies will be commercial within a decade, and together will have social implications just as profound as the Internet's impact over the past decade. They won't put the climate genie back in its bottle, but they're globally applicable so will rapidly cut carbon-polluting activities to pre-industrial levels. That leaves us with a ""simpler"" problem to solve. Not how do we stop putting carbon in the air - that's coming so long as we can just stay civilised. The ""simpler"" problem is, how do we deal with the irreversible positive feedback loops we've put into motion? When the last of the arctic sea ice melts - possibly as soon as this year - we're going to see climate processes kick in that haven't operated for at least 125,000 years. No one has the foggiest idea what will happen then. The one thing we know for certain is it will happen faster than any of our models. Greenland, for example, is melting 900% faster than any of the models due to dark-coloured algal blooms forming on the surface of its ice. They were only discovered last year, and none of the models account for them. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKfP63NH4DM 125,000 years ago, there was a sudden and enormous influx of fresh water into the oceans around Bermuda. We know this because of patterns of growth in fossilised shellfish. And he fresh water conditions lasted for several centuries. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016PA003014/abstract If Greenland's ice isn't stable under the conditions that are about to occur, we may experience a sudden rise in ocean levels of about 7 meters. That would inundate almost all large cities around the planet all at once. And, if that happened, staying civilised might not be a simple thing to do at all.",UCBZuAZiW7L78ZZpda6FNBug,1,Uggd5Wpccyv-eHgCoAEC,3CM_KkDuzGQ,2017-04-08 19:53:48

But things are moving fast, a lot of really exciting innovation happening with energy storage, both long term and short term. Solar/Wind doesn't completely replace fossil fuels yet, but it can certainly reduce it. But in the long term, burning fossil fuels for energy is simply not an option. 3D printed food sounds very exciting, haven't looked into that in detail. I really doubt we could convince everyone one to be came vegetarian (struggle with that myself), so I really hope someone comes up with a way to grow/print a viable meat-analog.",UCW0cG4zyFG8oKAlOom4KonQ,1,Uggd5Wpccyv-eHgCoAEC,3CM_KkDuzGQ,2017-04-08 19:53:48
