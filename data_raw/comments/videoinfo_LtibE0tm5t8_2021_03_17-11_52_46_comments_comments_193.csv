People often say the ""climate always changes"" , they are right but that is over periods of thousands or tens of thousands of years, which gives animals plenty of time to adapt. As of right now the rate of climate change is many times that of the warm or cooling of the ice ages. If you are interested in the natural world i'd advise that you look up Yellowstones youtube channel, they are current;y experiencing quite a few problems concerning climate change and they explain everything in an easy way for people like me who aren't scientists. As you say polar bears don't just eat seals but it accounts for 75% of their diet (depending on the season). I wouldn't be so sure that they will develop the ability to chase down caribou (not that bears can do that anyway) or other large mammals living above the arctic circle.

Yes you are right right, habitat loss is the number 1 cause for loss in biodiversity, which is also the case for polar bears. However this is caused primarily by climate change as there are CONCLUSIVE photos of the sea ice in the arctic get smaller each decade which is the main factor in their minor declines and it will be the reason they will be on the list of endangered species in the future. I was not saying that climate change was the leading factor behind the rhinos decline, it was not a point to be taken literally. I was pointing out that you simply can't state that climate change is not having an effect on wildlife without any data to back it up. Coincidentally there is plenty of data which shows how climate change is having an already significant impact on wildlife. Here in the UK the organisation responsible for recording and analysing bird populations is the BTO, (yes I am a keen nature enthusiast and birdwatcher), and the data they have show that birds migrate to Britain earlier than ever before (this year was the earliest year many African migrants have arrived in the UK in many decades).

Only one website said that there were estimate of 21000 to 30000 polar bears left. They are not thriving as they have enduring minor declines (key word minor). Future predictions say that they could decline by 30-55% by 2050. How do you know exactly how climate change is impacting other animals without any data whatsoever?

That&#39;s what warmth does. Some polar bears are starting to find food onshore. When they have sea ice, seals are fatter and more plentiful.<br /><br />During the far warmer Eemian interglacial -- the warm phase just before the Holocene, in the current Ice Age -- polar bears may not have had any sea ice to speak of. The Eemian was thought to have been as much as +5C warmer than today&#39;s &quot;scorching&quot; temperatures. And that temperature went on for hundreds of years. A few thousand years were spent at least as warm as today and much of it far warmer. There is evidence off the coast of one lone island north of Europe that it experienced cold climate like today, but that was isolated. Greenland saw massive melting throughout the Eemian. Polar bears survived just fine.<br /><br />We live in an Ice Age. Life does very poorly in the cold. Just look at the population gradient from poles to equator. Just look at the conditions during the last glacial period of the current Ice Age. Civilization could not start for 90,000 years during that brutal cold. Then, 12,000 years ago, global warming made civilization possible. Population levels began to explode.<br /><br />Do you really want to return to glacial conditions to accommodate the polar bear?

One of the most common myths about polar bears is that their population numbers are overall increasing. Pre-1970’s we had very little scientifically reliable polar bear population estimates, little more than educated guesses. We can begin to quantify population number increases during the 1970’s due to the implementation of hunting regulations. As expected this helped increase the polar bear numbers within these populations. Now we can monitor populations more reliably due to advances in technology, we can see static or downward trends in almost every subpopulation within the arctic. As explained by Dr Gavin Schmidt in the film, we are very aware that our climate changes naturally over hundreds of millions of years. The important fact (that more than 97% of climate scientists agree with) is that we are causing and experiencing rapid unusual changes to our climate system. The pace of this change is greater than any ecosystem can evolutionarily adapt to (including humans). Polar bears cant simply adapt to living on a land based diet. For more detail on this topic please see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eH7Ra6nT-A. The very simple fact is that Polar Bears in the wild rely on sea ice to survive. Also, certainly don't be mislead by thinking the Arctic is void of life. Quite the contrary; it is actually a very complex ecosystem teeming with life! From polar bears, walrus and whales down to the incredibly important plankton, fish and birds. By saying we need to ‘stop climate change’ we are not referring to longer-term natural cycles, but the proven changes and damage we are causing right now. By greatly reducing our rampant greenhouse gas emissions we can help stop or even reverse these negative effects on our planet today.",UCRehThdoYRRahD_gGhv5Ubg,1,UgiHszCaVTq_ungCoAEC,LtibE0tm5t8,2016-02-26 15:00:22
