Let's take the company ""Monolith Materials"" from Nebraska for example. They produce clean CO2-free hydrogen from natural gas with renewable electricity. They do it with a technology from Norway called ""Kværner process"" whose waste product is not CO2 but pure & solid carbon which can be disposed. It also happens to be the most energy efficient and therefore cheapest known method to produce hydrogen, it needs 87% less energy than electrolysis of water and even less energy than the current state-of-the-art method ""Steam Reforming"" which is used today to produce 95% of all hydrogen in the industry. I spoke with the engineers, they told me that the Kværner process also works with oil! Technologies like these will make it possible to establish a clean hydrogen infrastructure much faster so that more Americans can use electric cars with long range and which take only minutes to refuel. Hydrogen can also power trains, ships and passenger jets, it is used to make ammonia for fertilizers and currently replaces carbon in the production of steel in Europe. All the leaked and wasted methane could be used to produce tons of clean hydrogen instead.",UCWS2BboCEeyX3AA58zN6G0w,1,UgzrZToQQLLEt5Oo-3l4AaABAg,4_4uy_mggrs,2021-01-27 20:23:51

Hmm that's fishy, I'd ask myself what other stories have they spinned and what information am I not being told. Do a little digging, learn opposing bits of fact and information, trace the narratives back to their origins and you'll find CNN & MSNBC hasn't been exactly honest lately. Then the question becomes what other narratives that I believe that could be wrong? Well just research those narratives yourself and fact check and verify whether or not they hold water. You probably won't do such but it's what I did when I thought the media was to be trusted, but unfortunately I was wrong... the power to shape narratives is incredibly dangerous in the wrong hands...",UC-wD14YuNTD04KcuD-1IwAQ,1,UgxAcsqZXMKHIYA42Zl4AaABAg,4_4uy_mggrs,2021-01-27 20:23:51

Even the king of Israel knew it and had all the first born 2 and under executed. It was Isaiah that told them way in advance of His coming. The thing is, everyone and I mean everyone was expecting a conqueror, a king! Not some homeless guy from Nazareth. But, He was the one who fulfilled everything Isaiah said. When Jesus died, Lucifer fell from power. We can argue about the existence of Jesus until the cows come home but to deny the existence of Lucifer is different because even the Satanist believe in Jesus. Bible says even the demons believe and tremble. But Lucifer was kinda tricked into it. Lucifer being the extreme narcissist that he is is not going to listen to anyone or anything but that which satisfies his ravenous lust for power. When Christ died, it turned the world upside down. Judas went and hung him self and Nero light Rome on fire and played his fiddle while he watched it burn. Hundreds of thousands of people all became believers and thousands more got in line to be slaughtered because of their faith in Christ. Bible didn’t exist. Only the Old Testament that was kept locked in synagogues. But the people knew that He was the one. To disagree with a man who never hurt anyone because you disagree with a book is fairly peculiar to say the least. Kinda like throwing the baby out with the bath water don’t you think? By the way, who named you Thomas? You do know where that name comes from right? A Jewish fisherman perhaps? One that doubted. Refused to believe unless he could place his hand inside Jesus’s body through the wound in his side. Thomas puts his hand inside the wound and says “My Lord and my God.” Right soon after this happened it wasn’t long and we as a people were thrusted into the dark ages and the religious elite murdered millions of people who refused to deny Jesus as lord. Kinda odd don’t you think Thomas? The most powerful Christian organization in the world murdering Christians for their faith. Then also murdered Christians just for having a Bible. Murdered Christians just because they had read a Bible. Murdered people just because they thought you might have been exposed to a Bible. They murdered people just because they could. Foxes book of martyrs talks all about it. Bible does a little bit. Once again, if the Bible didn’t have any power then it wouldn’t matter. Wouldn’t matter who has one or who reads it. It’s like if I say oh Buddha! HA HA yeah that’s funny or praise you Ghandi! Yeah yeah that’s a good one. But if I say thank you Jesus! Cricket’s...... Silence and scorn. Go to work and start saying every so often “thank you Jesus” and see what happens. Promotion? I know, hot date. Better yet, how about a big party in your favor. How about the door instead. Labeled a kook and rejected by all your peers and relentlessly mocked. Put on a Ghandi T-shirt and see if you get the same results.

Since he is everywhere at once. That should have been easy. But, yes the bible can be read in so many different ways. So far about 30,000 of them. A pile of different bibles as well.

I think what you struggle with is the hypocrisy and rightfully so. It stinks to high heaven. The stench is so bad that someday there will be an abrupt adjustment. Let me explain: The concept of not being a Christian unless you’re a registered Republican is absurd. The exact opposite is true. Let’s talk about Jesus for just a moment. He never hurt anyone. Gave of himself until it killed Him. True? Thomas there was a man named Jesus and He did badly insult religious leaders and started a movement. He was homeless and slept on the ground. Today’s church is the exact opposite, for the most part. Jesus kept turning people away and to go home. A pastor wants people to come and stay. Jesus told people to give their money to the poor. Pastors say give it to me and if there’s anything left it will go to the poor. Jesus said do not swear an oath but all politicians do. Thomas, if a Christian is someone who does what Jesus says, if you do the opposite then you are something entirely different aren’t you? It gets worse, they place their hand on a Bible and do the exact thing Jesus said to not do. Then comes the evangelical Christian and votes for them. They just became a participant in that sin. I believe it is absolutely impossible for a politician to be a Christian. Those who vote and claim salvation are in error. But there was a man named Jesus and He said Whosoever will call on my name will be saved. Unfortunately that’s as far as it goes with most people. I’m going to let you in an a little secret. I’m going to explain something to you that is a paradox. It’s the easiest thing you will ever do but at the same time it’s the hardest. You ask how is that possible? It’s a paradox and it’s both and what I’m telling you is true. If I said it was easy and only easy, you being of the character that you are Thomas you would not believe me. Likewise if I say it’s so hard that you can never achieve it you would also not believe. But this is the secret. Salvation and every sense of this word is as simple as saying “thank you.” A man who never hurt anyone once said “the Lord inhabitants the praises of His people.” Stay with me ok! Thomas, this means that if you give God praise, He will automatically come to you. He will inhabit you and dwell within you. It’s that simple. Thank you. BUT. I promise you there will come a day when it will take everything within you to mutter two little words, thus the test. Most if not all Christians fail and their supposed to. But do they get back on their feet and acknowledge their faults or do they pick up a Bible and act righteous and beat people with it. It’s usually the latter isn’t it Thomas. Man is corrupt and he will always destroy all that he touches including god. When you eat chicken do you eat the feathers? How about the entrails? Legs? Of course not right. Churches are full of dead men’s bones and there’s a whole slew of folks just waiting for a baby Christian to show up with a brand new Bible just itchin to open his mouth and cram it full of bones. The closer we get to the end the worse it gets but be of good cheer because Jesus said I will never leave you nor forsake you. But He also said if you abide in me I will abide in you. Never ever stop saying “thank you” and you will win",UCPxp5FfvIAjMYdYflP8xXmA,1,Ugz94JhzU9qOxx8Dw2d4AaABAg,4_4uy_mggrs,2021-01-27 20:23:51

However, everywhere else in Greenland gets an average of 10 inches of snow per year (still more than the 4 - 8 inches that fall in the Arctic). Core sampling would be unreliable in that one specific region of Greenland, but scientists primarily operate in the northern Greenland and other cold deserts like Antarctica. Cubic zirconia diamonds are fake diamonds: they contain zero carbon.

The Kværner process is more energy efficient and therefore cheaper in the long run than the current state-of-the-art method ""steam reforming"" which is used to produce 95% of all hydrogen in the industry. Together with the alternative method methane-pyrolysis it is possible to produce clean hydrogen from fossil fuels without CO2. This can power cars, trains, ships & airplanes, can be used to produce ammonia for fertilizers and for CO2 free production of steel. I wrote to the scientists who developed both methods and they say that these technologies also work with crude oil.

My point is everyone has a different opinion/strategy on how to keep people healthy, educated, and living comfortably. Now, when it comes to global warming, it is mostly natural (the precession of the Earth changing; water vapor being the most abundant greenhouse gas; and the Sun’s activity), but it is also found to be partly anthropogenic. Carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide trap heat and can also cause water vapor to become more concentrated in our upper atmosphere, creating more of a heating effect. As for nuclear power, I agree, that could help. We could add onto that more hydroelectric power dams and allow for universal net metering, to encourage more people to generate their own power (as it would cost less)—that generation tending to be cleaner (solar panels, mini wind turbines, and geothermal power).",UC6l95jRZfr_18gCAD4YOQSg,1,UgzE1CefpySAW86FFUx4AaABAg,4_4uy_mggrs,2021-01-27 20:23:51

The Kværner process is more energy efficient and therefore cheaper in the long run than the current state-of-the-art method ""steam reforming"" which is used to produce 95% of all hydrogen in the industry. Together with the alternative method methane-pyrolysis it is possible to produce clean hydrogen from fossil fuels without CO2. This can power cars, trains, ships & airplanes, can be used to produce ammonia for fertilizers and for CO2 free production of steel.

Our european oil & gas companies feel the pressure from politics since more than 2 decades and guess what they did? They send their chemists to work and they found a solution. Two years ago they developed a method to produce clean hydrogen from natural gas and oil without CO2 emissions. It's a process called methane pyrolysis or hydrocarbon pyrolysis. It consumes 87% less energy to produce the same amount of hydrogen than electrolysis of water. BASF for example built a fully operational demonstrator plant in Germany and they will enter the market in just a couple of years. Hydrogen is not only a good fuel for electric cars and future jet aircraft, it can also replace carbon in the production of steel and in fact it does already so in pilot plants in Germany and Sweden. You as american citizens should read more science news and get interested in technology and engineering. I read all these comments here and wonder why you are still stuck in the 1990s with your knowledge about the possibilities. In addition to that you should also not forget about his: Oil is the base material for most chemistry which does not involve burning it. Plastic, synthehtic materials, even tooth-paste require it. Even if you replace oil entirely in energy generation & fuel production you are still left with way more than 50% of your business as an oil-company!",UCWS2BboCEeyX3AA58zN6G0w,1,Ugwm-xTXwBxulOdml4B4AaABAg,4_4uy_mggrs,2021-01-27 20:23:51

This can power cars, trains, ships & airplanes, can be used to produce ammonia for fertilizers and for CO2 free production of steel.

But I found your idea interesting and did some research: First off, we're talking about deuterium + tritium fusion here, which is the current state of technology and what ITER will be doing. Deuterium / Deuterium and Deuterium / Helium-3 work differently and produce less or no neutrons. 1. The neutrons carry most of the fusion's energy (14,1 MeV) as kinetic energy and (as far as we know) can't be confined, so they collide with the walls of the reactor, which heats it up (which is then used to heat water and run a turbine). As far as I understand, free neutrons are usually caught by some atom quickly, so neutrons are rarely free long enough to go through their beta-decay or it will be quite tricky to do that. 2. If we found some way to prevent the above and harness free neutrons until they decay, there are two parts that could in theory give more energy: a) The electron, as you said, should be rather simple to catch - free electricity (I guess?!). b) The anti-(electron)-neutrino would probably be more difficult to get to annihilate as neutrinos don't interact much with anything, as you know. But what you describe is something like the *Cowan–Reines neutrino experiment* (see Wikipedia): So *if* it annihilates, this happens: Antineutrino + proton --> neutron (again) + positron (""anti-electron""). The latter annihilates with an electron and produces two gamma rays (= photons) with an energy sum of about 1 MeV, while the neutron will usually be caught by some core (again, if not somehow contained). So, 1 MeV is rather measly in comparison to the 14 MeV from the neutron's kinetic energy, which we can mostly harvest. Also note that you would have to put an electron into the annihilation first, so I don't know if the net energy outcome would even in theory be positive. Hope I got this about right, just learned parts of it myself. Maybe we still get lucky and some real nuclear physisicst chimes in to enlighten us ;-).",UCBkHzwOEcOt4srB3cQeN0CQ,1,Ugzsu4mgLri4kg4H6hN4AaABAg,4_4uy_mggrs,2021-01-27 20:23:51

The more people handle it, the more likely that stuff WILL go wrong due to that glorious ""human error"" variable.

By what I understand, free Neutrons decay (in under 15 mins) into a proton, electron, and an antineutrino (antimatter). Charged particles can be confined with magnetic fields. If, theoretically if... that antimatter is made to annihilate with that same proton... wouldn't that be more energy released? The free electron (if captured) could be channeled into electricity directly. There might be some gamma ray bursts out of that, but... again, blue sky thinking.... we can confine that.

Though fusion reactors also will not be completely risk-free (as is basically no sort of energy-production - even photovoltaic fires are really dangerous and hard to put out), they are *way* less dangerous than fission reactors, which they are going to replace and produce only a small fraction of the amount of waste, that even has a much, much shorter radioactive half-life.

The reaction can be stopped as easily as turning off the hydrogen feed valves and bringing the plasma temperature down. The latter is done by turning off the fuel hydrogen. If the plasma cools, it does not collide, it does not fuse. The free Neutrons can be captured more readily than stopping the basic nuclear decay of fissile materials. And not every fusion reaction even produces neutrons. The holy grail is Helium-3 fusion, which will produce none.

It’s a very competitive world out there and companies have to minimise costs to compete against a global market . So if governments increase the cost of energy by installing costly renewable power plants and storage batteries and impose costly environment regulations for these companies to manufacture their goods, then these companies will simply offshore their business to other countries that have lower energy costs , lower labour cost and less regulations. Now if the whole world reduced their emission together then everyone would be on an equal footing and we might be able to force the change over to renewables . However, China and india are the biggest carbon emitters in the world and they don’t have to start reducing their emissions until 2030. So that’s why governments have such resistance to investing in 100% renewables , because it could destroy their economy and give significant competitive advantage to countries like China and India .",UCZU1vf-oDeB-vnTJshdZnhA,1,UgyCL6rSO4U9CrNl3zR4AaABAg,4_4uy_mggrs,2021-01-27 20:23:51

Cars have become way less polluting over the years, primarily through the work of government rather than the free market which has little to no incentive to make cars pollute less. These are called externalities, effects of economic activity which are external to the market which determines their price. One of the primary causes of government intervention into a market is to eliminate these externalities whether it be alcohol licensing, gambling regulations, reducing harmful toxins in cigarettes, protecting national parks from deforestation and mining etc etc. The same applies to slowly and carefully shifting to renewables. In fact, shifting in a controlled manner will likely be better than if the market does it as it’s more likely to be done far more quickly and abruptly by the free market, as you said, which would be a much bigger shock to the people and communities who work in fossil fuel industries if they all lose their jobs pretty much overnight if renewables suddenly become cheaper and more efficient.",UClUZR9LUxZX1MnubXGxxkgg,1,UgyCL6rSO4U9CrNl3zR4AaABAg,4_4uy_mggrs,2021-01-27 20:23:51

This will eventually happen but I believe we should allow the market to determine the timing of when this happens rather than try to force the change.

Also, unemployment did not rise under Obama, the economy grew, unemployment fell from 8% to under 5% and incomes grew faster than inflation nationally. But yes I understand that rural America fears democratic policy as it doesn’t adequately address how to mitigate the negative impacts on the small communities and towns that may be left behind. However other countries have shown it can be done without leaving an economy in tatters with sky high unemployment. It’s possible to scale back fossil fuel production and replace it with renewable energy which is more cost effective, more sustainable longer term and pays better wages. But it’s all about what to do with the people currently working in those industries who fear what will happen to their livelihoods. It’s a debate that needs to be had, and I hope progress can continue to be made, as it always has been. Just remember that 60 years ago, there were way more jobs in manual work than there are now, but over time the economy shifted to more white collar work than blue collar, as all rich western countries have over the 20th century.",UClUZR9LUxZX1MnubXGxxkgg,1,UgyCL6rSO4U9CrNl3zR4AaABAg,4_4uy_mggrs,2021-01-27 20:23:51

The vast majority of Scotland's energy supply comes from wind so high winds provide an overabundance of offshore energy supply generated amply by the turbines. We do also have other options like nuclear power and hydroelectric energy production to draw from. As you know ... Scotland isn't the sunniest of places at the best of times and so we've maximised other sources to suit in our energy mix. There have been some localised power outages due to faults in the transmission networks, but that's hardly anything to do with green energy. If anything it's just another reason to accelerate the transition to renewables by investing in battery storage and the localising of power distribution grids. Ironically ... in the greener world of tomorrow no household would lose electric supply in a storm. Each home would be autonomous and separate from the grid. Self sufficient with a full battery of storage in the house. Local sub stations would hold redundancy in larger power bank battery storage units that could continue to supply energy during almost any 'epic disaster'. There is an epic disaster happening. The climate crisis. It's happening right in front of your face. A short mini ice age is but a precursor to the true glacial freeze of a more permanent ice age vacation. We've been here before. It's just not something you'd expect to see so dramatically in an inter glacial period. As the gulf stream moved south before the last ice age, Canada, North America, Europe, Russia and Siberia ... were engulfed by an advancing glacial ice sheet. I like a bit of snow for a few days or weeks at a time ... but not for millennia. One day the gulf stream might not snap back.",UCTu8SWolI1vFRWG4jvesewQ,1,UgwSyRSN1d_dXiCmIk54AaABAg,4_4uy_mggrs,2021-01-27 20:23:51

The Kværner process is more energy efficient and therefore cheaper in the long run than the current state-of-the-art method ""steam reforming"" which is used to produce 95% of all hydrogen in the industry. Together with the alternative method methane-pyrolysis it is possible to produce clean hydrogen from fossil fuels without CO2. This can power cars, trains, ships & airplanes, can be used to produce ammonia for fertilizers and for CO2 free production of steel. I wrote to the scientists who developed both methods and they say that these technologies also work with crude oil.

From Newsweek: When the State Department released their report on the Keystone XL pipeline last month, news media focused on the report's conclusion that the pipeline would not significantly worsen carbon pollution. The finding was broadly declared a win for advocates of the project, who are now imploring the White House to approve it. But buried in the 11-chapter report was a less sunny detail: the Keystone XL would create only 35 permanent jobs after the one or two years of construction jobs dry up. ""Once the proposed Project enters service, operations would require an estimated 50 total employees: 35 permanent employees and 15 temporary contractors,"" the State Department wrote. Republican supporters of the pipeline have long said the project would be a major job creator. In 2012, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce took out a full page ad in the New York Times warning President Obama not to say ""no"" to ""20,000 jobs,"" a number taken from the pipeline company's estimates. NEWSWEEK SUBSCRIPTION OFFERS > When Sen. Johnny Isakson (Ga.-R) said in a speech in 2012 that the pipeline would ""employ 20,000 people,"" the fact-checking site PolitiFact rated his statement as ""false."" PolitiFact noted that even if one were to accept the pipeline company's job number, each ""job"" is counted as one ""job year."" That means that if the construction project lasted two years, one employee working for two years would be counted as having two ""jobs,"" leaving the number of employees at somewhere closer to 10,000. The latest State Department report, which also defines a ""job"" as a position filled for one year, estimates that the project would create 16,100 jobs directly related to Keystone XL. Another approximately 26,000 year-long jobs would created indirectly (restaurant and store workers, for example, needed to accommodate the temporarily increased population along the pipeline). That brings the State Department's total to 42,100 year-long jobs. RELATED STORIES Keystone Pipeline Would Save 6 Lives a Year, Report Says Keystone Pipeline Will Not Affect Canada Oil Sands Growth: U.S. Report Included in that number, the report estimates that about 10,400 seasonal workers would be recruited for construction of the pipeline for jobs lasting four to eight months. If those short stints are calculated into an average annual jobs, that works out to 3,900 jobs over one year of construction, or 1,950 jobs each year for two years, the State Department wrote. After one to two years, the vast majority would leave, and 35 people would be permanently employed, according to the report. Last year, Obama dismissed the claim that the pipeline could reduce unemployment in the U.S., calling the potential impact of Keystone XL a ""blip"" in terms of job creation. NEWSWEEK SUBSCRIPTION OFFERS > ""Republicans have said that this would be a big jobs generator,"" Mr. Obama said in an interview with the New York Times. ""There is no evidence that that's true. The most realistic estimates are this might create maybe 2,000 jobs during the construction of the pipeline, which might take a year or two, and then after that we're talking about somewhere between 50 and 100 jobs in an economy of 150 million working people."" A 2011 study conducted by Cornell University's ILR Global Labor Institute, which works with trade unions on environmental and other challenges, concluded that the Keystone XL pipeline could actually destroy more jobs than it created. The study takes into account job loss that would be caused if Midwesterners end up paying 10 to 20 cents more per gallon of gas due to the pipeline diverting oil from Midwest refineries to the Gulf region. ""Furthermore, pipeline spills, pollution and increased greenhouse gas emissions incur significant human health and economic costs, thus eliminating jobs,"" Sean Sweeney, director of the Cornell ILR Global Labor Institute, said in a statement. For now, the White House says Obama will wait at least 90 days from the release of the State Department report before deciding whether to approve the pipeline.",UCZbipdgtkjqnGs_SpQc_WvA,1,UgwSyRSN1d_dXiCmIk54AaABAg,4_4uy_mggrs,2021-01-27 20:23:51

Two years ago they developed a method to produce clean hydrogen from natural gas and oil without CO2 emissions. It's a process called methane pyrolysis or hydrocarbon pyrolysis. It consumes 87% less energy to produce the same amount of hydrogen than electrolysis of water. BASF for example built a fully operational pilot plant in Germany and they will enter the market in just a couple of years.

So far they are located in mountains but in order to build them in flat terrain they are now exploring the possibility to use abandoned coal mines as underground lakes. Someone has to tell the coal miners from West-Virginia that there is plenty of work for them 😉 They can either dig deep mines which serve as hydro-electric batteries or overground ring wall storages.

Mexico is further south and they gonna suffer even more than you do, guess where they gonna escape to? Now about fossil fuels. There is just one geologist who claims that oil and gas are of non-fossil origin. It is just one fringe scientist and his theory is without merit. Just one out of millions probably, the many geologists who actually work for Shell, Exxon and BP have very different evidence for the origin of oil & gas. But it is not my intention to bash you. You may have an other opinion on aesthetics of wind-turbines and still you can support Joe Biden in his ambitious plan.

The economics of it are now heavily in favour of investment and getting ahead of the game. We already sell green energy to other countries and the scope for growth in that market is exponential. I believe it was also somewhere in Australia that they started using the Tesla Powerpack batteries. That facility saved around $40 million in its first year alone and has also helped to stabilize and balance the region’s unreliable grid. Such utility grade battery storage and distribution solutions are also now becoming economically unbeatable.

You already get a decent subsidy for buying electric, as do we here. It may well increase. That coupled with the falling price of EV ownership over the next couple of years will go a long way to accelerating change. Believe it or not ... our government is now supplying EV's to local government and civil service, councils and the like. By 2030 you won't be able to buy an ICE vehicle here. It won't be allowed. Tesla are not only releasing the semi this year but are designing an entry level vehicle for around $19,000. It may be in production this year. With government subsidies and attractive ownership incentives that could come down a lot further. Let's not forget it will also be the first model to make up a fully autonomous robo taxi fleet which again ... will change the whole concept of car ownership entirely. An owner will make money from their EV ... driving down costs further. The energy density in modern batteries is already sufficient to begin looking at electric boats as a realistic option over the next few years. There are already million mile batteries with 6 - 700 miles range and that's increasing all the time. Helicopters ... then maybe one day planes. Though air travel in itself could be tolerable for now if all other criteria are met. Oil as a fuel not only is dead but necessarily has to be made dead and buried. I think you'll be surprised at how quickly things will change over this decade. The likes of B.P have already announced their reduced production timeline up to 2035 and the immediate start of their own transition to a net zero, green energy company by 2050. 2050. That's what Biden said. Net zero emissions by 2050. 2035 is the date set out in the Paris accord. You aren't doing enough. You are still not honouring your global obligations. You still don't seem to grasp the severity of our current existential human predicament. This is a climate 'crisis'. We should be acting like it. You seem to think we have a choice in any of this? We do not. We are screwed. It is now about survival, and trust me ... in the coming years that won't be granted to all no matter what we do now. The earth is changing. We are on it. It's time to stop sticking our heads in the sand and deal with it as best as we can. Wake up friend. We can't stop it now. It's too late. This is about mitigation. You guys need to make this your next Apollo program ... but on a much grander scale.

The Republican Party is against it because their elected officials are in the pocket of the fossil fuel industry. But guess what, Exxon & the Koch brothers don't have to worry about their profits and oil workers don't have to worry about their jobs! European oil & gas companies mastered a process called ""Methane Pyrolysis"" and it will enter the market in 2 to 5 years. If hydrocarbons (natural gas & oil) are exposed to great heat in absence of oxygen they decompose to solid carbon and hydrogen gas, there are no CO2 emissions. This process requires 87% less energy to produce the same amount of clean hydrogen than the conventional clean method which is electrolysis of water. Therefore hydrogen becomes affordable both as a fuel for electric cars, future hydrogen jet aircraft and last but not least as a reducing agent for iron-ore. Yes hydrogen can replace carbon in the production of iron. Green steel from the rust belt would be competitive over here against the dirty crap from China because Europe introduces carbon taxes. This is Methane Pyrolysis in the Netherlands: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsCP89FunF8 This is steel production with hydrogen in Germany: https://www.thyssenkrupp.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/pressdetailpage/green-hydrogen-for-steel-production--rwe-and-thyssenkrupp-plan-partnership-82841 I have a much longer list of cool technologies which are green and which help to keep or even create new jobs and which make it possible that you guys can continue to live your american way of life.

The Kværner process is more energy efficient and therefore cheaper in the long run than the current state-of-the-art method ""steam reforming"" which is used to produce 95% of all hydrogen in the industry. Together with the alternative method methane-pyrolysis it is possible to produce clean hydrogen from fossil fuels without CO2. This can power cars, trains, ships & airplanes, can be used to produce ammonia for fertilizers and for CO2 free production of steel. I wrote to the scientists who developed both methods and they say that these technologies also work with crude oil.

The Kværner process is more energy efficient and therefore cheaper in the long run than the current state-of-the-art method ""steam reforming"" which is used to produce 95% of all hydrogen in the industry. Together with the alternative method methane-pyrolysis it is possible to produce clean hydrogen from fossil fuels without CO2. This can power cars, trains, ships & airplanes, can be used to produce ammonia for fertilizers and for CO2 free production of steel. I wrote to the scientists who developed both methods and they say that these technologies also work with crude oil.

I really don’t want to know the answer to that but if it’s not who’s gonna take that vehicle off your hands? if their are no more gas or diesel vehicles allowed or even gas stations to supply the fuel to fill up them up.. oh boy more jobs at risk hun???? Let’s just say they are allowed to continue to be driven. Where’s the gas gonna come from?!?!?! not to mention It will no longer hold a value. So evidently you don’t work in the gas or oilfield industry because if u did you wouldn’t be so quick to say YAY instead you would be wondering how your gonna pay for a vehicle with no dollar value left to it and the so expensive one that’s all electric not to mention the roof over your head. God forbid you are fixed income and can’t afford these cars god forbid you have some other kind of job that depends on you know the money flow thing that keeps the world turning because when the oil and gas goes so does the flow of money. Oh wait silly me the million jobs created verses the 2-5 million jobs lost hmmmm... guess that’s a no brained too right?!?!? and let’s discuss one more thing all the way through.... these jobs he’s talking about with higher pay well if all you ever did was oil and gas field or maybe just at a GAS station you really think you have a chance at a job at a factory??? better make sure you know someone or you better be at a young age cuz most men that do oilfield work have been doing this for the most part of their lives.. do you think employers will look at how loyal or dependable these men were on a rig that you know supplied gas for that vehicle your now complaining about having?? Or will they be looked as to old?!?!? I mean good old Biden is pretty much talking about the young people in this video and one more thing about that factory job that will probably not be in the state you reside in what then are you willing to uproot yourself and possibly family on a whim of a chance you get that job out of the people that already reside in the state they are going to put this factory in? Boy boy boy the nerve of some to call people stupid or accuse one of wanting our country to fail.. I would be willing to bet my last bottom dollar yall didn’t think about these things either when being so degrading cuz if u did sorry but not sorry you would have made sure to state these concerns and not be so quick to put others down or holler out yay let’s do this.... JUS SAYIN LOUD AND. CLEAR if your willing to hear?!?!?!?,UCYsW3SjenPRrsNZCOH9XUYA,1,UgwbXrT6GtYdHBIkax54AaABAg,4_4uy_mggrs,2021-01-27 20:23:51

So please enlightenment how are parents and grand parents supposed to afford these cars. Don’t say credit cuz that’s only one factor of it your income has to be able to support any purchase ever made before credit is granted not to mention the people who don’t have credit to buy one. While on the subject of CREDIT what’s gonna happen to yours if u have a vehicle that no longer holds value for a dealership or a creditor to take off your hands if you are currently paying on one now.. oh I’m sure Biden’s committee are probably stringing through the comments to offset everyone’s concerns with promises that won’t be kept. So being the genius of the supporters of these great ideas please share your thoughts on these issues. You see people with money that think they have no worries are usually the ones to support ideas that are not thought out completely or no backup plans to what happens to the elderly which could end up being a loved one of yours. And as for the million jobs it’s gonna supply again that doesn’t provide income for the elderly who are retired or disabled. Oil and gas have been around for centuries and it has what kept the flow of green flowing without that flow everyone’s job is at risk and now riggers who never worked in an automobile industry won’t get that so called pay rate he speaks of because they have no experience again nothing has been thought out to completion yet in one day an executive order has been signed to begin ceasing oil and gas. Wake up people and I would say before it’s to late but it’s already to late. I can’t wait to see comments from some of these supporters when they feel the bite coming from BIDEN whom I predict won’t stay in office and it won’t be by his choice. Mark these words it’s coming all he did was sign his exit papers when he took over just watch.,... because shit is gonna get real in a very bad way in the very near future! I’m looking forward to watching all the ones who are so quick to Down put TRUMP while he was in office to even the ones for simply stating their beliefs or their opinions.

Currently the best we have is a lithium battery. Lithium batteries have been around since the 80's. Lithium batteries have lots of toxic heavy metals in them. They require huge amounts of energy to mine and build. Generally automotive batteries are warranted around 10 years but that is somewhat dependent on how they are maintained. They are also extremely expensive. Electric cars the same way they dont last very long expensive repairs and they have to be done at a stealership. With that being said I do believe that there needs to be something better than gas or diesel but battery powered vehicles is not the way. Hydrogen would be a better alternative as most internal combustion engines can run on hydrogen with minor modifications. Hydrogen also has no negative emissions. We just need a better way to split hydrogen.,UC5R27cAXiELf55Iguca3Nyw,1,UgwbXrT6GtYdHBIkax54AaABAg,4_4uy_mggrs,2021-01-27 20:23:51

And the natural cycle does respond to warming and cooling trends. But we have poured gasoline on a fire that should be dying. We are due for a cooling trend.

We kill trees and burn or destroy the increasing carbon gases in the atmosphere which in turn reduces the CO2 taken out and in turn raise temps and reduces precipitation.

The Republican Party is against it because their elected officials are in the pocket of the fossil fuel industry. But guess what, Exxon & the Koch brothers don't have to worry about their profits and oil workers don't have to worry about their jobs! European oil & gas companies mastered a process called ""Methane Pyrolysis"" and it will enter the market in 2 to 5 years. If hydrocarbons (natural gas & oil) are exposed to great heat in absence of oxygen they decompose to solid carbon and hydrogen gas, there are no CO2 emissions. This process requires 87% less energy to produce the same amount of clean hydrogen than the conventional clean method which is electrolysis of water. Therefore hydrogen becomes affordable both as a fuel for electric cars, future hydrogen jet aircraft and last but not least as a reducing agent for iron-ore. Yes hydrogen can replace carbon in the production of iron. Green steel from the rust belt would be competitive over here against the dirty crap from China because Europe introduces carbon taxes. This is Methane Pyrolysis in the Netherlands: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsCP89FunF8 This is steel production with hydrogen in Germany: https://www.thyssenkrupp.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/pressdetailpage/green-hydrogen-for-steel-production--rwe-and-thyssenkrupp-plan-partnership-82841 I have a much longer list of cool technologies which are green and which help to keep or even create new jobs and which make it possible that you guys can continue to live your american way of life.

The Kværner process is more energy efficient and therefore cheaper in the long run than the current state-of-the-art method ""steam reforming"" which is used to produce 95% of all hydrogen in the industry. Together with the alternative method methane-pyrolysis it is possible to produce clean hydrogen from fossil fuels without CO2. This can power cars, trains, ships & airplanes, can be used to produce ammonia for fertilizers and for CO2 free production of steel. I wrote to the scientists who developed both methods and they say that these technologies also work with crude oil. America is independent from oil & gas imports and could use these resources to drastically reduce emissions.",UCWS2BboCEeyX3AA58zN6G0w,1,UgwgFS_9iWGUOy7kxYp4AaABAg,4_4uy_mggrs,2021-01-27 20:23:51

What about your mom dad grandparents who may be on a fixed income is joe Biden gonna buy each of them a car like this. How are fixed income people going to afford that does that even matter? Not to mention what happens to the cars they have that are paid off and run off of gas will it even be allowed to own one and at the least if they are allowed where are they going to get the gas for it. Can’t y’all see straight through the bullshit this man is feeding y’all. Slowly but surely everything that’s ever existed by choice will be taken away because if he’s all that about preserving this planet of life that has existed just fine for many centuries off of oil and gas u better get ready to make sure you can afford one of those all electric cars and u better make damn sure you have the credit to buy one.. hmm wonder if our so smart president considered all these matters before saying he’s gonna do this and that oh wait DID HE EVEN BOTHER TO ASK CONGRESS. If y’all only knew my prediction for what’s coming y’all all might want to break out your Bible and ask god to intervene now before it’s gets out of hand.

The Kværner process is more energy efficient and therefore cheaper in the long run than the current state-of-the-art method ""steam reforming"" which is used to produce 95% of all hydrogen in the industry. Together with the alternative method methane-pyrolysis it is possible to produce clean hydrogen from fossil fuels without CO2. This can power cars, trains, ships & airplanes, can be used to produce ammonia for fertilizers and for CO2 free production of steel. I wrote to the scientists who developed both methods and they say that these technologies also work with crude oil.

To secure oil fields that are currently in the hands of the Kurds. The bidens will raise oil prices by shutting the US oil industry done (he promised to shut it down) while making money from the increased oil price supplied by other countries. The Hunter biden laptop scandal shows how the bidens benefited from foreign oil companies. Does anyone ask what are these companies that pay millions of dollars to the bidens getting in return? The bidens are not energy experts yet they getting millions from energy companies and this spell of good fortune only came along after Biden was VP under Obamas watch and it look set to continue.

Ivanka has 18 trademarks in China and made tens of millions there. She even posted a video of her daughter singing in Chinese pandering to them. Kushner received $400 million through his deals with Anbang. Trump praised Xi for the re-ed camps saying “he did exactly the right thing to do” Have you noticed that Trump NEVER criticizes Xi by name? He’s too much of a coward to do anything other than vaguely and ambiguously criticize the country. His pathetic excuse for a Trade War ended up hurting the American workers and barely put any dent in China’s economy.

You do it by supporting the `Circus Freak in-Chief`, Donald Trump. You do it by partaking in identity politics, a facet of the white supremacist ideology. Trump supported white supremacy by expressing a belief in & support for the white supremacist `cOnSpIrAcY tHeOrIeS` that Barack Obama was not born in the United States of America, that he is a Muslim, etc. He gleefully accepted a leadership role in these white supremacist `cOnSpIrAcY tHeOrIeS` even though they had long-since been disproven years earlier. He supported white supremacy by retweeting white supremacist tweets containing white supremacist `cOnSpIrAcY tHeOrIeS`, such as `birther-gate`, etc. He supported white supremacy by supporting the (neo-)Confederate Flag, being against the removal of Confederate statues and by being against the renaming of military bases named after Confederate soldiers. He also catered to white supremacy with trying to carry through on his FAKE promises about a wall on the US-Mexico border, a white supremacist utopian horror `cOnSpIrAcY tHeOrY`.

Paris climate promises will reduce temperatures by just 0.05°C in 2100 A new peer-reviewed paper by Dr. Bjorn Lomborg published in the Global Policy journal measures the actual impact of all significant climate promises made ahead of the Paris climate summit. Governments have publicly outlined their post-2020 climate commitments in the build-up to the December’s meeting. These promises are known as “Intended Nationally Determined Contributions” (INDCs). Dr. Lomborg’s research reveals: The climate impact of all Paris INDC promises is minuscule: if we measure the impact of every nation fulfilling every promise by 2030, the total temperature reduction will be 0.048°C (0.086°F) by 2100. Even if we assume that these promises would be extended for another 70 years, there is still little impact: if every nation fulfills every promise by 2030, and continues to fulfill these promises faithfully until the end of the century, and there is no ‘CO₂ leakage’ to non-committed nations, the entirety of the Paris promises will reduce temperature rises by just 0.17°C (0.306°F) by 2100. US climate policies, in the most optimistic circumstances, fully achieved and adhered to throughout the century, will reduce global temperatures by 0.031°C (0.057°F) by 2100. EU climate policies, in the most optimistic circumstances, fully achieved and adhered to throughout the century, will reduce global temperatures by 0.053°C (0.096°F) by 2100. China climate policies, in the most optimistic circumstances, fully achieved and adhered to throughout the century, will reduce global temperatures by 0.048°C (0.086°F) by 2100. The rest of the world’s climate policies, in the most optimistic circumstances, fully achieved and adhered to throughout the century, will reduce global temperatures by 0.036°C (0.064°F) by 2100. Overview in Celsius and Fahrenheit by the year 2100 What does this mean for the Paris Summit? Dr. Lomborg said: “Paris is being sold as the summit where we can help ‘heal the planet’ and ‘save the world’. It is no such thing. If all nations keep all their promises, temperatures will be cut by just 0.05°C (0.09°F). Even if every government on the planet not only keeps every Paris promise, reduces all emissions by 2030, and shifts no emissions to other countries, but also keeps these emission reductions throughout the rest of the century, temperatures will be reduced by just 0.17°C (0.3°F) by the year 2100. And let’s be clear, that is very optimistic. Consider the Kyoto Protocol, signed in 1997, never ratified by the US, and eventually abandoned by Canada and Russia and Japan. After several renegotiations, the Kyoto Protocol had been weakened to the point that the hot air left from the collapse of the Soviet Union exceeded the entire promised reductions, leaving the treaty essentially toothless. The only reason Kyoto goals were almost achieved was the global 2008 recession. Moreover, emissions were shifted from one country to another. The EU, the most climate-engaged bloc, saw an increase in its emission imports from China alone equaling its entire domestic CO₂ reductions. In total, 40% of all emissions were likely shifted away from the areas that made promises. Negotiators in Paris are trying to tackle global warming in the same way that has failed for 30 years: by making promises that are individually expensive, will have little impact even in a hundred years and that many governments will try to shirk from. This didn’t work in Kyoto, it didn’t work in Copenhagen, it hasn’t worked in the 18 other climate conferences or countless more international gatherings. The suggestion that it will make a large difference in Paris is wishful thinking.” What should countries do instead? Dr. Lomborg said: “Instead of trying to make fossil fuels so expensive that no one wants them – which will never work – we should make green energy so cheap everybody will shift to it. The Copenhagen Consensus on Climate project gathered 27 of the world’s top climate economists and three Nobel Laureates, who found that the smartest, long-term climate policy is to invest in green R&D, to push down the price of green energy. Subsidizing inefficient renewables is expensive and doesn’t work. The IEA estimates that we get 0.4% of our energy from wind and solar PV right now, and even in optimistic scenarios the fraction will only rise to 2.2% by 2040. Over the next 25 years, we’ll spend about $2.5 trillion in subsidies and reduce global warming temperatures by less than 0.02°C. Copenhagen Consensus has consistently argued for a R&D-driven approach. Fortunately, more people are recognizing that this approach is cheaper and much more likely to succeed –including the Global Apollo Program which includes Sir David King, Lord Nicholas Stern, Lord Adair Turner and Lord John Browne. You describe a 0.05°C reduction, but the UN Climate Chief, Christina Figueres, said Paris could lead to a 2.7°C rise instead of 4°C or 5°C. Why? Christiana Figueres quote: “The INDCs have the capability of limiting the forecast temperature rise to around 2.7 degrees Celsius by 2100, by no means enough but a lot lower than the estimated four, five, or more degrees of warming projected by many prior to the INDCs.” Dr. Lomborg said: “That entirely misrepresents the world’s options. The 2.7°C comes from the International Energy Agency and essentially assumes that if governments do little in Paris and then right after 2030 embark on incredibly ambitious climate reductions, we could get to 2.7°C. That way of thinking is similar to telling the deeply indebted Greeks that just making the first repayment on their most pressing loans will put them on an easy pathway to becoming debt-free. It completely misses the point. Figueres’ own organization estimates the Paris promises will reduce emissions by 33Gt CO₂ in total. To limit rises to 2.7°C, about 3,000Gt CO₂ would need to be reduced – or about 100 times more than the Paris commitments (see figure below). That is not optimism; it is wishful thinking. http://www.lomborg.com/press-release-research-reveals-negligible-impact-of-paris-climate-promises",UCLwF3cdhi9p2NfuFvOb-kaQ,1,UgzvfCS6si_1aFiMVah4AaABAg,4_4uy_mggrs,2021-01-27 20:23:51

Our european oil & gas companies feel the pressure from politics since more than 2 decades and guess what they did? They send their chemists to work and they found a solution. Two years ago they developed a method to produce clean hydrogen from natural gas and oil without CO2 emissions. It's a process called methane pyrolysis or hydrocarbon pyrolysis. It consumes 87% less energy to produce the same amount of hydrogen than electrolysis of water. BASF for example built a fully operational demonstrator plant in Germany and they will enter the market in just a couple of years. Hydrogen is not only a good fuel for electric cars and future jet aircraft, it can also replace carbon in the production of steel and in fact it does already so in pilot plants in Germany and Sweden. You as american citizens should read more science news and get interested in technology and engineering. I read all these comments here and wonder why you are still stuck in the 1990s with your knowledge about the possibilities. In addition to that you should also not forget about his: Oil is the base material for most chemistry which does not involve burning it. Plastic, synthehtic materials, even tooth-paste require it.

The waste is solid carbon which can be buried in old mines as waste. If the energy comes from renewables then the hydrogen is CO2-free. The reason for the high efficiency is that water is already a low energy combustion product while natural gas isn't. In fact this concept is known since the 1960s, the fossil fuel companies were just to lazy to develop it into a working technology... until 2 years ago. One would assume that republican politicians who work for the fossil fuel lobby would have a lot of knowledge about petro-chemistry and could help with their contribution.",UCWS2BboCEeyX3AA58zN6G0w,1,UgwTwdF5mP7BdiGMx0R4AaABAg,4_4uy_mggrs,2021-01-27 20:23:51

Our european oil & gas companies feel the pressure from politics since more than 2 decades and guess what they did? They send their chemists to work and they found a solution. Two years ago they developed a method to produce clean hydrogen from natural gas and oil without CO2 emissions. It's a process called methane pyrolysis or hydrocarbon pyrolysis. It consumes 87% less energy to produce the same amount of hydrogen than electrolysis of water. BASF for example built a fully operational demonstrator plant in Germany and they will enter the market in just a couple of years. Hydrogen is not only a good fuel for electric cars and future jet aircraft, it can also replace carbon in the production of steel and in fact it does already so in pilot plants in Germany and Sweden. You as american citizens should read more science news and get interested in technology and engineering. I read all these comments here and wonder why you are still stuck in the 1990s with your knowledge about the possibilities. In addition to that you should also not forget about his: Oil is the base material for most chemistry which does not involve burning it. Plastic, synthehtic materials, even tooth-paste require it. Even if you replace oil entirely in energy generation & fuel production you are still left with way more than 50% of your business as an oil-company!",UCWS2BboCEeyX3AA58zN6G0w,1,UgwTwdF5mP7BdiGMx0R4AaABAg,4_4uy_mggrs,2021-01-27 20:23:51

Our european oil & gas companies feel the pressure from politics since more than 2 decades and guess what they did? They send their chemists to work and they found a solution. Two years ago they developed a method to produce clean hydrogen from natural gas and oil without CO2 emissions. It's a process called methane pyrolysis or hydrocarbon pyrolysis. It consumes 87% less energy to produce the same amount of hydrogen than electrolysis of water. BASF for example built a fully operational demonstrator plant in Germany and they will enter the market in just a couple of years. Hydrogen is not only a good fuel for electric cars and future jet aircraft, it can also replace carbon in the production of steel and in fact it does already so in pilot plants in Germany and Sweden. You as american citizens should read more science news and get interested in technology and engineering. I read all these comments here and wonder why you are still stuck in the 1990s with your knowledge about the possibilities. In addition to that you should also not forget about his: Oil is the base material for most chemistry which does not involve burning it. Plastic, synthehtic materials, even tooth-paste require it.

Scroll down to the second video. You guys who are all for fracking are either ignorant of the damage that fracking does to the water supply (among other things), or you know and just don't care. It doesn't take a computer engineer to do a Google search on the harm that fracking can do to the environment. Those of you who are anti-anything Joe Biden does will not listen, read , or watch anything that might cause you to change your mind, but this is a 60 second clip to give you an idea of what some communities where fracking goes on have to contend with. https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/l7sbh9/brian_williams_with_exclusive_video_from/?%24deep_link=true&correlation_id=14ddad22-6615-4939-acbc-86a5aac28cd1&ref=email_digest&ref_campaign=email_digest&ref_source=email&%243p=e_as&%24original_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2FPublicFreakout%2Fcomments%2Fl7sbh9%2Fbrian_williams_with_exclusive_video_from%2F%3F%24deep_link%3Dtrue%26correlation_id%3D14ddad22-6615-4939-acbc-86a5aac28cd1%26ref%3Demail_digest%26ref_campaign%3Demail_digest%26ref_source%3Demail&_branch_match_id=769677173889929335",UCa2VJblmze2oKiMob8K7-9Q,1,Ugx27pqY9Qo44J56jX54AaABAg,4_4uy_mggrs,2021-01-27 20:23:51

So he places a 60-day moratorium on the NEW leasing of drilling on federal land. Okay, cool. We still have the existing ones. Problem is, he ain’t gonna allows new ones. So what you want, but he won’t. So what does that mean? There are billions of cars in the US using oil and gas, we have to get that from somewhere. Now we are going to be energy dependent on foreign countries rather than utilizing what we have here locally and in Canada. What sense does that make? Now we have to use ships that use oil to transport said oil as well when we can create jobs HERE and streamline the production and safe delivery of LOCAL oil.

It&#39;s long but true. <br />My father was a race car driver in the 60s/70s. In his travels he got to know a guy named Ralph Moody who was an engine wizard that built NASCAR engines in the early Richard petty era. In the 70s there were multiple gas shortages which inspired him to build mainstreet engines focused on gas mileage. He did so. (I heard this story straight from the horse&#39;s mouth). He built a diesel car engine that got 90 miles per gallon &amp; a standard engine that got 68 in the 1970s. During an advertisement campaign where Moody drove his &quot;Moody Diesel&quot; from coast to coast in 1979 when smog was 1st becoming an issue he was repeatedly pulled over by cops (almost as if they were ordered to harass him) During this process his car was repeatedly inspected with smog detectors... They couldn&#39;t register a reading because the engine burned cleaner than anything that has ever hit the road... <br />Moody&#39;s engines would also come with a lifetime guarentee to never break btw. <br />After going public, offers to buy his patents started rolling in, &amp; so did threats in late night phone calls. Eventually Moody sold his patents for 90% less than original offers because the EPA ruled his engine unfit citing &quot;unknown long term environmental impact.&quot; In other words a clean burning engine that got 5x the MPG than average cars in the late 70s &amp; came with a lifetime guarentee was shut down... by the &quot;Environmental Protection Agency&quot; LOL!!! <br />Out of fear he would be killed for informing the public that engines 10x better than what we had could be available anytime Moody sold his patents &amp; signed a non compete clause agreeing to never build anything of the kind again. That technology has sat in a vault somewhere since 1980 while the government continues to use the &quot;climate crisis&quot; as one of it&#39;s biggest money makers for their corporate masters.",UCUyJo1-HpGw-lIz8dUHoWZw,0,UgzUrpFTzEiVJXvX30h4AaABAg,4_4uy_mggrs,2021-01-27 20:23:51

The Kværner process is more energy efficient and therefore cheaper in the long run than the current state-of-the-art method ""steam reforming"" which is used to produce 95% of all hydrogen in the industry. Together with the alternative method methane-pyrolysis it is possible to produce clean hydrogen from fossil fuels without CO2. This can power cars, trains, ships & airplanes, can be used to produce ammonia for fertilizers and for CO2 free production of steel.

Following the comment sections, the CNN youtube posts became oddly predictable. If it is any other news story, only the people who cared about the topic commented. BUT if it had the picture of a former or current president/candidate, it would be trolled by the same generic cocktail of all caps faceless profiles. ""THE SOCIALISTS WANT TO SELL ARABIC COMUNISM TO MEXICAN CHINA! FAKE NEWS OTHERWISE!"" 4 years of reading 30 of those comments every time Hillary's face was in a thumbnail. Even if the video is about Hillary or another democrat fucking up and getting caught, the trolls would treat it as CNN endorsing a completely different crime/rumor. Always 1000 dislikes (give or take) but never 900 or 1200. Like that first 1000 were always gonna be there even if CNN posts a ""Obama commits tax fraud. He is under investigation"", the 1000 dislikes will be there and scream ""CNN IS STALIN AND HITLER HAVING BUTT SEX ON A PILE OF STOLEN FREEDOMS! RADICAL LEFTIE SNOWFLAKES"". 4 years............... of this. So, I can safely say, YOU, complaining about ""Lefties in the comments"" after all of that. After all the trolls. After god knows how many wacky nuts pretending to be conservatives or centrists while doing all caps leet speak about Qanon, pizza gate and flat earth. You, are not a critic. You are not observant.

They will push the oil prices up to the benefit of the oligarchs. Look at this timeline and tell me if you dont see a pattern Early 2014 Hunter Biden associate Devon Archer joins Burisma board. Archer was the top fundraiser for secretary of state John Kerry 16 April 2014 Devon Archer visits VP Joe Biden in the white house 18 April Hunter Biden with no experience in the oil industry whatsoever joins the board of Burisma. Burisma then paid $90 000 to ML strategies lobbying firm headed by David Leiter (john Kerry's former chief of staff) then Kerry visited Ukraine with promises of aid for the oil industry. 21 April VP Joe Biden promises billions US tax dollar aid to Ukraine oil industry to help ramp up production. ML strategies paid $60 000 to dem senators Gene Shaheen and Ed Markey. These two senators in June 2014 wrote to Obama requesting that more aid be given to Ukraine's energy industry to increase their oil and gas production. Ed Markey was the senate sponsor of the Green New Deal as championed by Biden to shut down US gas production but increase Ukraine production. By the end of Obama's term in 2018 the USA had given $3billion of aid and loan guarantees to Ukraine to ramp up production. Do you really believe that the dems are worried about carbon emissions Joe Biden bragged about how he got the prosecutor in Ukraine firedby blackmailing the Ukrainians by threatening to withhold $1 000 000 000 in aid unless the president of Ukraine fires the prosecutor. The prosecutor was investigating a certain oligarch at a Ukrainian oil company called Burisma for corruption. Hunter Biden was a director of Burisma at the time making $90 000 per month.

Cause if you do there's no point in people wasting time with you. BOTH water vapour and CO2 absorb infrared radiation. But there are two key differences. One, water vapour sits low in the atmosphere, whereas CO2 goes up as high as 50km. This higher altitude makes CO2 much more prominent in absorbing infrared radiation. Secondly, and much more importantly, water vapor does not control the Earth’s temperature, but is instead controlled by the temperature. The amount of water molecules on the planet don't change. Water is either a vapour in the atmosphere or a liquid on the ground, this state changes based on the temperature.

Yes, CO2 is not a dominant gas in the atmosphere, but even slight increases have a detrimental impact on Earth's ecology. Climate changes over hundreds of thousands of years, even millions of years, but the issue today is that climate is changing at a rapid speed because of human activities. We see the consequences every year, record heat waves, record storms, record sea-level rise, record fires, record ocean acidification, record extinction, record drought, etc. The change is so rapid that nature and humans are unable to adapt. Imagine the refugee and water crisis of the future. We could barely handle 100 thousand Syrian refugees imagine hundreds of millions as a result of climate degradation. Transitioning our energy sector requires thinking locally, using renewable technology on a small scale, microgrids, installing solar panels on every house so they become self-sufficient. No one is saying eliminate oil, we understand that oil is essential for petroleum products like plastic. What we are saying is to change the way we power our cities, and change the way we transport our goods and people. Transforming our sources of electricity, and eliminating the combustion engine is how we will solve this crisis. And no, renewable sources are actually incredibly powerful and very effective, especially when done on a smaller, more manageable scale. Again, you're also missing the point that this is an opportunity to create millions of jobs. Nuclear? No thanks.

I guess if I smoke and mirrored green energy for a living I would probably be it’s biggest advocate also. Regardless of the fact that even though things like solar energy from solar panels are getting closer, the energy, fossil fuel, and pollution used to produce, transport, and install the required equipment outstrip the lifetime energy produced. That is also why I personally know of several green energy methane power plants all over the US offline. Looks great on paper.

They are thinking about hydrogen production by renewable electricity and transportation through pipelines that were used for natural gas. In the Netherlands the natural gas pipelines and installations are tested and test used for transportation of hydrogen and it looks like it's a big succes. Hydrogen can also be used for heating houses. Cars, trucks, trains and even planes and ships will be tanking with high pressure hydrogen, much like LNG. Fuel cell technology for generating electricity on board of the vehicles. By the way hydrogen is not a strange product in the oil industry.

There’s an interchange, periodically, of ice ages. When it’s cold it called a glacial period and when it’s warm it’s called interglacial. Add in the fact that according to science we’ve not discovered every spot of land on earth and we’ve only tackled 5% of the ocean, so how do we know exactly the toll our actions as humans have on the climate? According to science, the climate was and is and always will be destined to change. I do believe we should do better and use common sense and be considerate of our planet.

Biden ran on a ticket of closing down the US oil industry while he and his son have interests in foreign oil companies in Ukraine, China and Kazakhstan. They will push the oil prices up to the benefit of the oligarchs. Look at this timeline and tell me if you dont see a pattern Early 2014 Hunter Biden associate Devon Archer joins Burisma board. Archer was the top fundraiser for secretary of state John Kerry 16 April 2014 Devon Archer visits VP Joe Biden in the white house 18 April Hunter Biden with no experience in the oil industry whatsoever joins the board of Burisma. Burisma then paid $90 000 to ML strategies lobbying firm headed by David Leiter (john Kerry's former chief of staff) then Kerry visited Ukraine with promises of aid for the oil industry. 21 April VP Joe Biden promises billions US tax dollar aid to Ukraine oil industry to help ramp up production. ML strategies paid $60 000 to dem senators Gene Shaheen and Ed Markey. These two senators in June 2014 wrote to Obama requesting that more aid be given to Ukraine's energy industry to increase their oil and gas production. Ed Markey was the senate sponsor of the Green New Deal as championed by Biden to shut down US gas production but increase Ukraine production. By the end of Obama's term in 2018 the USA had given $3billion of aid and loan guarantees to Ukraine to ramp up production of oil and gas. Do you really believe that the dems are worried about carbon emissions Joe Biden bragged about how he got the prosecutor in Ukraine firedby blackmailing the Ukrainians by threatening to withhold $1 000 000 000 in aid unless the president of Ukraine fires the prosecutor. The prosecutor was investigating a certain oligarch at a Ukrainian oil company called Burisma for corruption. Hunter Biden was a director of Burisma at the time making $90 000 per month. Biden had no oil and gas experience. Then an email shows that Burisma thanked Hunter for this. This guy has no plan to build the country.

But, I think you have things a little confused. You see carbon isn't bad for the environment, in fact it's great for plants. Plants love carbon co2 it's why the jurrasic period was so lush because of all the volcanos emitting carbon into the air that the plants where feeding on. And it's quite ironic how the oil this carbon is derived from are the dead biological material from that same period in the past! We are throwing carbon into the atmosphere that originated from a time during the most plant growth BECAUSE OF CARBON! It's so amazing isn't it? We have all been sold a lie that carbon is bad. It's not! While unregulated dirty carbon is bad becaus it contains mercury and other heavy metals, the regulated CLEAN carbon the united states produces is not bad. It's good for plants. People are shocked to even fathom that such a vast lie could be told but they fail to understand there is much more control and money to be had by taxing carbon than producing it, by regulating carbon you regulate an entire countries economy, it's energy, it's blood... Climate change is a lie that perverts science to make a whole lot of people over seas more rich and powerful. Because if you can control the united states energy, you basically can control the united states... It's not a difficult concept to understand but it's apparent when it's greedy cut throat politicians moving this agenda forward. Big global banking apparatuses moving it along.

They will push the oil prices up to the benefit of the oligarchs. Look at this timeline and tell me if you dont see a pattern Early 2014 Hunter Biden associate Devon Archer joins Burisma board. Archer was the top fundraiser for secretary of state John Kerry 16 April 2014 Devon Archer visits VP Joe Biden in the white house 18 April Hunter Biden with no experience in the oil industry whatsoever joins the board of Burisma. Burisma then paid $90 000 to ML strategies lobbying firm headed by David Leiter (john Kerry's former chief of staff) then Kerry visited Ukraine with promises of aid for the oil industry. 21 April VP Joe Biden promises billions US tax dollar aid to Ukraine oil industry to help ramp up production. ML strategies paid $60 000 to dem senators Gene Shaheen and Ed Markey. These two senators in June 2014 wrote to Obama requesting that more aid be given to Ukraine's energy industry to increase their oil and gas production. Ed Markey was the senate sponsor of the Green New Deal as championed by Biden to shut down US gas production but increase Ukraine production. By the end of Obama's term in 2018 the USA had given $3billion of aid and loan guarantees to Ukraine to ramp up production. Do you really believe that the dems are worried about carbon emissions Joe Biden bragged about how he got the prosecutor in Ukraine firedby blackmailing the Ukrainians by threatening to withhold $1 000 000 000 in aid unless the president of Ukraine fires the prosecutor. The prosecutor was investigating a certain oligarch at a Ukrainian oil company called Burisma for corruption. Hunter Biden was a director of Burisma at the time making $90 000 per month.

The Kværner process is more energy efficient and therefore cheaper in the long run than the current state-of-the-art method ""steam reforming"" which is used to produce 95% of all hydrogen in the industry. Together with the alternative method methane-pyrolysis it is possible to produce clean hydrogen from fossil fuels without CO2. This can power cars, trains, ships & airplanes, can be used to produce ammonia for fertilizers and for CO2 free production of steel. I wrote to the scientists who developed both methods and they say that these technologies also work with crude oil.

Our european oil & gas companies feel the pressure from politics since more than 2 decades and guess what they did? They send their chemists to work and they found a solution. Two years ago they developed a method to produce clean hydrogen from natural gas and oil without CO2 emissions. It's a process called methane pyrolysis or hydrocarbon pyrolysis. It consumes 87% less energy to produce the same amount of hydrogen than electrolysis of water. BASF for example built a fully operational demonstrator plant in Germany and they will enter the market in just a couple of years. Hydrogen is not only a good fuel for electric cars and future jet aircraft, it can also replace carbon in the production of steel and in fact it does already so in pilot plants in Germany and Sweden. You as american citizens should read more science news and get interested in technology and engineering. I read all these comments here and wonder why you are still stuck in the 1990s with your knowledge about the possibilities. In addition to that you should also not forget about his: Oil is the base material for most chemistry which does not involve burning it. Plastic, synthehtic materials, even tooth-paste require it. Even if you replace oil entirely in energy generation & fuel production you are still left with way more than 50% of your business as an oil-company!",UCWS2BboCEeyX3AA58zN6G0w,1,Ugy_DO4W0w1W7L5IhNN4AaABAg,4_4uy_mggrs,2021-01-27 20:23:51

When I hear people proclaiming the “use of science”, I think it would be fair to ask them to use facts or at least “their facts along with the source of such “facts”. Everybody must have heard that “figures cannot lie, but liars can figure”. Let’s see. With reference to the link below (whose truthfulness I cannot verify, but let’s say it is making an effort not to skew the data), https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.usatoday.com/amp/39548763 It says the following: 1. China • CO2 emissions from fossil fuel (2017): 9,838.8 million metric tons • CO2 emissions from fossil fuel per person (2017): 7.1 metric tons • Change from CO2 emissions in 1992: 270.3% 2. USA • CO2 emissions from fossil fuel (2017): 5,269.5 million metric tons • CO2 emissions from fossil fuel per person (2017): 16.2 metric tons • Change from CO2 emissions in 1992: 1.8% From a couple of websites, whose truthfulness I am not questioning, we find: China’s pop. 1992: 1,165 billions China’s pop. 2017: 1,386 billions China % pop. incr. since 1992= 19% USA pop. 1992: 256.51 millions USA Pop. 2017: 324.99 millions USA % pop. incr. since 1992= 27% So China is the largest pollution producer (9,838.8 million metric tons) vs. USA (5,269.5 million metric tons), ALMOST 2X. However when you divide the total pollution produced, by the respective populations, then The US produces 16.2 metric tons per person, vs. China at 7.1 metric tons per person. Looking at the Pollution Production increase for each country, it is 270.3% China to 1.8% USA. A huge difference. Comparing the respective population changes during the same time period, it’s 27% USA vs. 19% China. So for that given time frame even though the USA Population vs. China’s grew by a higher percentage (27% to 19%) the pollution production per capita, by China grew by a 150X factor vs. that of the USA. Amazing! Is it not? Another thing the pollution production increase numbers tell me is that using the per capita calculation is not indicative of shit. The total pollution must be broken down into its largest producers. Blaming the average Joe and saddling him/her with causing all this “average” pollution, is totally bullshit and unfair to Joe. I would be comfortable saying that most pollution is probably generated by the manufacturing sector. So from the above analysis (mine), I think it would be fair to say that China ABSOLUTELY generates around TWICE the pollution the US generates. That is science (maybe?)😀",UCqG4KRm_zQT-6fBiFVQCn-w,1,Ugz55-RKVyLfHn2uQIN4AaABAg,4_4uy_mggrs,2021-01-27 20:23:51

In regards to investments, research, and practical application China is leading the way. You fail to realize that there is a difference in scaled operation. China is leading the way in regards to the end consumer and small town level of application. Its a damn shame that we Americans dropped the ball on that opportunity. The second concept that you have failed to understand is the net goal. Sure they are building coal plants, but that will be offset by green buildings, transportation, and appliances. Thankfully President Joe Biden has shown true leadership and has signed an executive order to remedy the previous administration's absolute failure and ignorance. Lastly you fail to understand that the goal is not to completely eliminate certain energy, but instead to reduce the dependency. There is a finite amount of fossil fuel and if we can reduce the use and burden incrementally by year we can get to the point to offset the negative of fossil fuels while creating renewable energy. This all takes wisdom, talent, and hard workers. Again President Joe Biden is making a smart move by focusing on JOB creating industries vs dying industries where the labor has been replaced by machines.

Rather than relying heavily on foreign oil. Fracking was already a thing before the push towards renewable energy. Natural gas has also heavily reduced our dependency on coal. Which isn't clean, but it's definitely cleaner than coal. You can't just replace an entire industry without having it's replacement in place, otherwise their will be devastating consequences. That's why Biden is trying to push heavily into renewables so that fracking can be reduced over time and eventually phased out completely. Just as we have done with coal over the last 50 years. It's not a detour because we are already doing it. It's a means to the end. Coal usage has already dropped, but renewable only makes up like 20% of our energy right now. The majority of it comes from oil, gas, and coal. 80 years ago, coal was the largest producer of energy. Today it makes up less than 15%. 20 years ago, it made up almost 25%. The transition period always takes a long time. Had the US started heavily investing in renewables, especially solar and wind, 20 years ago, instead of constantly propping up the fossil fuel energy sector, we would have been a lot further along. And China wouldn't be the leader in that regard. So it what world do you suddenly expect fracking to suddenly end? What will replace our energy needs? Common sense dictates that we need to have a replacement in order to shut down fracking. As more renewables come on line, as more appliances convert to electric instead of gas, as more cars become more efficient and transition into fully electric, etc. the need for oil and fracking will go down. If it were feasible to shut it down right now, Biden probably would try. But again, common sense dictates that would literally cripple us. What do you expect to fill the 30-40% gap in energy that would come from cutting off fracking right now? Every one that believe that climate change is real, and takes it seriously knows that we need to start doing something and get the ball rolling, and that we should have started a long time ago.",UCXqd3SddrcwF-lGa598doLQ,1,UgzgKGuDQpX7pth3K894AaABAg,4_4uy_mggrs,2021-01-27 20:23:51

I've heard this excuse before: ""Why should I question what I'm told when it takes SO much trouble to do so?"" Fine, don't question. Don't listen to CNN. Doesn't matter to me what you believe. But when you start preaching this opinion based hogwash as truth, that's when it gets to be a problem. Let me say this once again: Over the past four plus years I've watched EVERY single irritating, obnoxious, rambling, incoherent speech trump has ever made. I've sat through his rantings and name calling and cutesy bullying. I've also watched Fox and Oann and Newsmax (granted, I couldn't take much of this, especially Hannity and Jeanine Shapiro and Greg Gutfed, but I did try). I do like Chris Wallace, the last man with integrity at Fox). I've been able to see through them right away ... and not because I'm special but because they're obvious. Newsmax and Oann are just poor journalists, often making grammar errors and mispronouncing names. I've watched their ""reporters"" ask trump questions while he was still doing press briefings (which was laughable). These ""questions"" were veiled praise that a three year old could see through, but trump lapped it up. I watched Stephanie Myers of Oann, dressed to the nines, ask trump something that sounded like, ""Why is it that everyone is so jealous of how amazing you are?"" Gag! And these are the people you believe know what they're talking about. I would wager that you had very little interest in politics prior to Obama and that you became really engaged when your boy trump took office. Then, I would also wager, that it wasn't a matter of politics, but a matter of ""team spirit"" ... a personality contest. This is how cults form. Mostly when you aren't paying attention but digging in because of your team. And as you're not noticing what you're actually doing, you're taking the entire Republican party (that used to be respected and honorable) and turning it into some sort of mud wrestling team that you're cheering on regardless of what they're doing. And in the meantime, almost 550,000 people have died, we've become the laughing stock of the world, our foreign relations is in shambles, and the worst aspects of who we are as Americans are held up as some sort of badge of honor. You have no idea what's going on in the country or where we'd be now if trump did win another term.

In South Africa for eg there is no mail in voting at all. In Britain you have to request it and with reason and even then there are safe guards. The safe guards were removed by the dems and the US elections really looked more like something from Zimbabwe. I am not against all democrat leaders. Tulsi Gubbard and even Bernie Sanders would be better than biden and Harris. Sanders although sometimes misguided is a man of his word. Gubbard would have made a great president. I do not agree with everything they say but they are reasonable people. The odd thing is that in 2020 Trump got more votes than in 2016 and he got a highest percentage of the black vote for a Republican since the 1960s. Also for the first time more Muslims voted for a Republican than Jews did.

This is far from looking at the merits of the matter. The CIA and FBI do lie. They even admit it. Its the antifa types that have a hold on AOC +++ also known as the squad. NOt the other way round. They fickle. The youth are not all as dumb as you think and do not all fall hook line and sinker for the leftists and communists. When white people are TEN times more likely to be killed by a black person than vice versa and TWELVE times more likely to be robbed by a black person then trust me they not all antifa and burn loot and murder supporters. The vote was stolen and you know it. There is ample evidence of this, didnt you watch the news of how Republican election observers were kicked out and stopped from working. Did you not hear the eyewitness testimony of boxes of unfolded mail in ballots being brought in. A court ordered audit of Dominion voting machines used in Michigan concluded that the systems are designed to perpetuate election fraud, supporting President Donald Trump’s claims of irregularities. State officials have criticized the report. The court-ordered forensic audit, carried out by Allied Security Operations Group (ASOG), found that Dominion systems in Antrim County, Michigan recorded a shocking 68 percent error rate while tabulating votes. The report noted that the faulty software far exceeds the “allowable election error rate” of 0.0008 percent set by the Federal Election Commission.  Dont fall for the media. “The media’s the most powerful entity on Earth.

What pray tell gives you the idea that I would have supported the nazis. People keep saying that Trump is a white supremacists but his actions really do not lend credence to that. Read below and let me know if these are the actions of white supremacist. In 2018, President Trump signed the groundbreaking First Step Act, a criminal justice bill which enacted reforms that make our justice system fairer and help former inmates successfully return to society. The First Step Act’s reforms addressed inequities in sentencing laws that disproportionately harmed Black Americans and reformed mandatory minimums that created unfair outcomes. The First Step Act expanded judicial discretion in sentencing of non-violent crimes. Over 90% of those benefiting from the retroactive sentencing reductions in the First Step Act are Black Americans. The First Step Act provides rehabilitative programs to inmates, helping them successfully rejoin society and not return to crime. Trump increased funding for historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) by more than 14%. Trump signed legislation forgiving Hurricane Katrina debt that threatened HBCUs. New single-family home sales are up 31.6% in October 2019 compared to just one year ago. Made HBCUs a priority by creating the position of executive director of the White House Initiative on HBCUs. Trump received the Bipartisan Justice Award at a historically black college for his criminal justice reform accomplishments. In January 2020 The poverty rate fell to a 17-year low of 11.8% under the Trump administration as a result of a jobs-rich environment and Poverty rates for African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans have reached their lowest levels since the U.S. began collecting such data. The Trump Administration is promoting second chance hiring to give former inmates the opportunity to live crime-free lives and find meaningful employment. Trump’s DOJ and the Board Of Prisons launched a new “Ready to Work Initiative” to help connect employers directly with former prisoners. President Trump’s historic tax cut legislation included new Opportunity Zone Incentives to promote investment in low-income communities across the country. 8,764 communities across the country have been designated as Opportunity Zones. Trump signed three bills to benefit Native people. One gives compensation to the Spokane tribe for loss of their lands in the mid-1900s, one funds Native language programs, and the third gives federal recognition to the Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians in Montana. Trump signed a bill to require airports to provide spaces for breastfeeding moms. In the eight years prior to President Trump’s inauguration, prescription drug prices increased by an average of 3.6% per year. Under Trump, drug prices have seen year-over-year declines in nine of the last ten months Trump appointed five openly gay ambassadors. Trump ordered Ric Grenell, his openly gay ambassador to Germany, to lead a global initiative to decriminalize homosexuality across the globe. Through Trump’s Anti-Trafficking Coordination Team (ACTeam) initiative, Federal law enforcement more than doubled convictions of human traffickers and increased the number of defendants charged by 75% in ACTeam districts.",UC3Q9oc48UJYwXv3WLsLAimw,1,UgwHjvhCIFaBzYSFr0V4AaABAg,4_4uy_mggrs,2021-01-27 20:23:51

Even IF the stormy daniels thing was true and settlements are not always an admission of guilt. Companies often settle to get rid of bad (true or false) publicity How would that affect the average citizen compared to the corrupt theft of billions? Bear with me on this. Biden ran on a ticket of closing down the US oil industry (he said he would ban fracking and phase out oil) while he and his son have interests in foreign oil companies in Ukraine, China and Kazakhstan. They will push the oil prices up to the benefit of the oligarchs. Look at this timeline and tell me if you dont see a pattern Early 2014 Hunter Biden associate Devon Archer joins Burisma board. Archer was the top fundraiser for secretary of state John Kerry 16 April 2014 Devon Archer visits VP Joe Biden in the white house 18 April Hunter Biden with no experience in the oil industry whatsoever joins the board of Burisma. Burisma then paid $90 000 to ML strategies lobbying firm headed by David Leiter (john Kerry's former chief of staff) then Kerry visited Ukraine with promises of aid for the oil industry. 21 April VP Joe Biden promises billions US tax dollar aid to Ukraine oil industry to help ramp up production. ML strategies paid $60 000 to dem senators Gene Shaheen and Ed Markey. These two senators in June 2014 wrote to Obama requesting that more aid be given to Ukraine's energy industry to increase their oil and gas production. Ed Markey was the senate sponsor of the Green New Deal as championed by Biden to shut down US gas production but increase Ukraine production. By the end of Obama's term in 2018 the USA had given $3billion of aid and loan guarantees to Ukraine to ramp up production. Do you really believe that the bidems and his buddies are worried about carbon emissions Joe Biden bragged about how he got the prosecutor in Ukraine firedby blackmailing the Ukrainians by threatening to withhold $1 000 000 000 in aid unless the president of Ukraine fires the prosecutor. The prosecutor was investigating a certain oligarch at a Ukrainian oil company called Burisma for corruption. Hunter Biden was a director of Burisma at the time making $90 000 per month. Biden had no oil and gas experience. Then an email shows that Burisma thanked Hunter for this. My only worry is that the FBI have had this laptop for more than a year now and after a year the famed FBI said that they still investigating and that the emails are not a Russian hacking campaign. Either the emails are true and someone will have info on the bidens and the truth is being kept from us or they are false or the FBI do not know what to do (and I think they know how to investigate authenticity of emails)?

They will push the oil prices up to the benefit of the oligarchs. Look at this timeline and tell me if you dont see a pattern Early 2014 Hunter Biden associate Devon Archer joins Burisma board. Archer was the top fundraiser for secretary of state John Kerry 16 April 2014 Devon Archer visits VP Joe Biden in the white house 18 April Hunter Biden with no experience in the oil industry whatsoever joins the board of Burisma. Burisma then paid $90 000 to ML strategies lobbying firm headed by David Leiter (john Kerry's former chief of staff) then Kerry visited Ukraine with promises of aid for the oil industry. 21 April VP Joe Biden promises billions US tax dollar aid to Ukraine oil industry to help ramp up production. ML strategies paid $60 000 to dem senators Gene Shaheen and Ed Markey. These two senators in June 2014 wrote to Obama requesting that more aid be given to Ukraine's energy industry to increase their oil and gas production. Ed Markey was the senate sponsor of the Green New Deal as championed by Biden to shut down US gas production but increase Ukraine production. By the end of Obama's term in 2018 the USA had given $3billion of aid and loan guarantees to Ukraine to ramp up production. Do you really believe that the dems are worried about carbon emissionsJoe Biden bragged about how he got the prosecutor in Ukraine firedby blackmailing the Ukrainians by threatening to withhold $1 000 000 000 in aid unless the president of Ukraine fires the prosecutor. The prosecutor was investigating a certain oligarch at a Ukrainian oil company called Burisma for corruption. Hunter Biden was a director of Burisma at the time making $90 000 per month. Biden had no oil and gas experience. Then an email shows that Burisma thanked Hunter for this.",UC3Q9oc48UJYwXv3WLsLAimw,1,UgwyEpg_MxWkWSY33sJ4AaABAg,4_4uy_mggrs,2021-01-27 20:23:51

They will push the oil prices up to the benefit of the oligarchs. Look at this timeline and tell me if you dont see a pattern Early 2014 Hunter Biden associate Devon Archer joins Burisma board. Archer was the top fundraiser for secretary of state John Kerry 16 April 2014 Devon Archer visits VP Joe Biden in the white house 18 April Hunter Biden with no experience in the oil industry whatsoever joins the board of Burisma. Burisma then paid $90 000 to ML strategies lobbying firm headed by David Leiter (john Kerry's former chief of staff) then Kerry visited Ukraine with promises of aid for the oil industry. 21 April VP Joe Biden promises billions US tax dollar aid to Ukraine oil industry to help ramp up production. ML strategies paid $60 000 to dem senators Gene Shaheen and Ed Markey. These two senators in June 2014 wrote to Obama requesting that more aid be given to Ukraine's energy industry to increase their oil and gas production. Ed Markey was the senate sponsor of the Green New Deal as championed by Biden to shut down US gas production but increase Ukraine production. By the end of Obama's term in 2018 the USA had given $3billion of aid and loan guarantees to Ukraine to ramp up production. Do you really believe that the dems are worried about carbon emissions. Joe Biden bragged about how he got the prosecutor in Ukraine firedby blackmailing the Ukrainians by threatening to withhold $1 000 000 000 in aid unless the president of Ukraine fires the prosecutor. The prosecutor was investigating a certain oligarch at a Ukrainian oil company called Burisma for corruption. Hunter Biden was a director of Burisma at the time making $90 000 per month. Biden had no oil and gas experience. Then an email shows that Burisma thanked Hunter for this.",UC3Q9oc48UJYwXv3WLsLAimw,1,Ugxpf6JIPqLUXj05Jh94AaABAg,4_4uy_mggrs,2021-01-27 20:23:51

They were mothers and fathers, husbands and wives, sons and daughters, friends, neighbors, and colleagues who leave behind grieving loved ones and a nation on edge. For the past year, we could not turn to the federal government for a national plan to answer prayers with action — until today. In the following pages, you will find my Administration’s national strategy to beat the COVID-19 pandemic. It is a comprehensive plan that starts with restoring public trust and mounting an aggressive, safe, and effective vaccination campaign. It continues with the steps we know that stop the spread liked expanded masking, testing, and social distancing. It’s a plan where the federal government works with states, cities, Tribal communities, and private industry to increase supply and administer testing and the vaccines that will help reopen schools and businesses safely. Equity will also be central to our strategy so that the communities and people being disproportionately infected and killed by the pandemic receive the care they need and deserve. Our national strategy will be driven by scientists and public health experts who will regularly speak directly to you, free from political interference as they make decisions strictly on science and public health alone. Above all, Vice President Harris and I, and our entire Administration, will always be honest and transparent with you about both the good news and the bad. The honest truth is we are still in a dark winter of this pandemic. It will get worse before it gets better. Progress will take time to measure as people getting infected today don’t show up in case counts for weeks, and those who perish from the disease die weeks after exposure. Even as we make progress, we will face setbacks. But I know we can do it, and that a true national strategy will take all of us working together. It will take Congress providing the necessary funding. Families and neighbors will need to continue looking out for one another. We will need health care providers, businesses, civic, religious and civil rights organizations, and unions all rallying together in common purpose and with urgency, purpose, and resolve. We will need to reassert America’s leadership in the world in the fight against this and future public health threats. There are moments in history when more is asked of us as Americans. We are in that moment now and history will measure whether we were up to a task. Beating this pandemic will be one of the most difficult operational challenges we have ever faced as a nation. I believe we are ready, as fellow Americans and as the United States of America. May God bless the lost souls of this pandemic, and all of you on the frontlines who define the best of who we are as Americans. Sincerely, President Joe Biden"" Sounds very Presidential and honorable to me",UCkvEXFIm_1DmJ5J5PQjna3Q,1,UgznE3YUB8AMJpnRWJd4AaABAg,4_4uy_mggrs,2021-01-27 20:23:51

They were mothers and fathers, husbands and wives, sons and daughters, friends, neighbors, and colleagues who leave behind grieving loved ones and a nation on edge. For the past year, we could not turn to the federal government for a national plan to answer prayers with action — until today. In the following pages, you will find my Administration’s national strategy to beat the COVID-19 pandemic. It is a comprehensive plan that starts with restoring public trust and mounting an aggressive, safe, and effective vaccination campaign. It continues with the steps we know that stop the spread liked expanded masking, testing, and social distancing. It’s a plan where the federal government works with states, cities, Tribal communities, and private industry to increase supply and administer testing and the vaccines that will help reopen schools and businesses safely. Equity will also be central to our strategy so that the communities and people being disproportionately infected and killed by the pandemic receive the care they need and deserve. Our national strategy will be driven by scientists and public health experts who will regularly speak directly to you, free from political interference as they make decisions strictly on science and public health alone. Above all, Vice President Harris and I, and our entire Administration, will always be honest and transparent with you about both the good news and the bad. The honest truth is we are still in a dark winter of this pandemic. It will get worse before it gets better. Progress will take time to measure as people getting infected today don’t show up in case counts for weeks, and those who perish from the disease die weeks after exposure. Even as we make progress, we will face setbacks. But I know we can do it, and that a true national strategy will take all of us working together. It will take Congress providing the necessary funding. Families and neighbors will need to continue looking out for one another. We will need health care providers, businesses, civic, religious and civil rights organizations, and unions all rallying together in common purpose and with urgency, purpose, and resolve. We will need to reassert America’s leadership in the world in the fight against this and future public health threats. There are moments in history when more is asked of us as Americans. We are in that moment now and history will measure whether we were up to a task. Beating this pandemic will be one of the most difficult operational challenges we have ever faced as a nation. I believe we are ready, as fellow Americans and as the United States of America. May God bless the lost souls of this pandemic, and all of you on the frontlines who define the best of who we are as Americans. Sincerely and respectfully, President Joseph R. Biden"" This screams leadership, kindness, strength, good policy and good leadership, this is a trustworthy man, this man is a leader, a man born to be a servant of the his people, and that is what he is, God Bless our President Joe Biden, join me in my best wishes for this great President because I know you are a smart woman, and you know how to pick the right leader, well this is it, have a good night.",UCkvEXFIm_1DmJ5J5PQjna3Q,1,Ugxm2urvcceO7DWrKJh4AaABAg,4_4uy_mggrs,2021-01-27 20:23:51

BNSF is owned by Berkshire Hathaway whos chairman is Warren Buffet. In the two election cycles, Buffet gave extensively to democrat causes and candidates. Buffet also had numerous fund raisers for Obama. There are no evidence of keystone causing any environmental damage but evidence of Warren Buffet being deeply involved to stop this.

The amount of steel required for wind and solar to replace fossil fuels exceeds the world’s capability to produce it for decades. “the unavailability of sufficient steel prevents wind from replacing just coal, since that would take 10 billion tons of steel.

They are banning fracking in the united state's because it cost's to much. In USA you have to pay oil workers a lot of money and pay for all the Osha approved equipment. Instead they want to buy oil from the middle east because its cheap over their and the politicians can make millions laundering the money. That's why we had an entire war in the middle east for oil. Trump started using the oil we had here so that made the war in the middle east useless. So he called the troops home because he didn't even like the war to begin with. I know you are leftist and brainwashed by CNN it's not your fault I don't blame you. But you need to look at the bigger picture of things. Why do you think the left hate's Trump so much. They are losing billions of dollars that they used to launder. Biden is just as corrupt as all the other politicians. I mean shit the guy has been a politician for 50 years. He know's all the scams.
