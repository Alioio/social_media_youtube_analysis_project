Well first let me tell you that the Earth is not actually spherical it is sort of a potato or an egg shape (not completely though) this is because all of the upper and lower parts of the Earth So it is not a complete sphere but if you see it from a distance at space it would look like a sphere Debunking Flat Earth Proof#1: LUNAR ECLIPSE Solar eclipses get all the attention, but if you are able to catch a glimpse of a lunar eclipse, you can see evidence that the Earth is, indeed, round. Here's how it works: Earth passes between the moon and sun, so that the sun projects Earth‚Äôs shadow onto the Moon in the night sky. You've probably seen a partial lunar eclipse without even noticing it; if the moon looks orange, that's a sign of a lunar eclipse. If you've ever seen a total lunar eclipse, you probably noticed that the shadow did not look like this.A round shadow crossed over a round object. This does not sound like a thing that would happen if we were on a plane with all of the celestial bodies simply hovering overhead‚Äîor, perhaps more assinine, if the sun were orbiting Earth and not vice versa. Proof#2: SUNSET Pick a nice spot from which you can watch a sunset (we'll call this point A). Ideally, you'd have a clear horizon in front of you, and behind you would be some sort of elevated point that you can quickly access (a hill, a building with at least two floors, or perhaps the aforementioned tree; we'll call this point B). Watch the sunset from point A, and once the sun is out of sight, hurry on over to point B. With the added elevation provided by point B, you should be able to see the sun above the horizon. If Earth were flat, the sun would not be visible at any elevation once it had set. Because Earth is round, the sun will come back into your line of sight. If you don't have a hill, you could even try lying on your stomach to watch the sunset and then standing up to get a higher line of sight. Proof#3 TIME ZONES According to a 2008 paper in Applied Optics by David K. Lynch, the curvature of the earth becomes somewhat visible at an elevation of 35,000 feet (with a >60¬∞ field of view) and more easily visible at an elevation of 50,000 feet. So if you're on the right commercial flight, you might be able to see the curvature of the earth with your own two eyes. In the event that you're not high enough, though, you can still experience the curvature of the earth another way. For example, if you were to fly all the way around the world, you'd find that it would be nighttime in part of the world and daytime in another part. In that way, the existence of time zones itself is proof that the Earth is round. Taken another way, you wouldn't even need to travel through different time zones. Time zones are wide enough that you will see the sun rising and/or setting later in the western part of a time zone than in the eastern part. According to the Farmers' Almanac, the sun will rise and set roughly four minutes later for every 70 miles you drive from east to west. If you wanted to combine this experiment with the previous one, you could note how much more of Earth you can see when you begin your ascent into the air than you can while you are sitting on the tarmac waiting to take off. Proof#4 SHADOWS Pick two locations that are some distance apart (at least a couple hundred miles from each other and on the same meridian). Grab two sticks or dowels (or other objects) of equal length, two tape measures, and a friend. Each of you will take one stick/dowel/object and one tape measure to your location, stick the object into the ground, and measure the shadow. (For accuracy, you should both take your measurements at the same time of day.) On a flat Earth, the shadow that is cast by each would be of the same length. However, if you and your friend compare notes, you'll find that one shadow was longer than the other. That's because, due to the curvature of Earth, the sun will hit one part of Earth at one angle and another part of Earth at a different angle even at the same time of day. This experiment has been around since about 240 B.C., when Greek mathematician Eratosthenes compared the shadows cast in both Syene‚Äînow Aswan, Egypt‚Äîand Alexandria on the summer solstice. Eratosthenes had learned of a well in Syene where once a year on the summer solstice, the sun would illuminate the entire bottom of the well and tall buildings and other objects would not cast a shadow. However, he noticed that shadows were being cast on the summer solstice in Alexandria, so he measured the angle of the shadow and found it to be an angle of about 7.2¬∞. --- I think that is enough but if you want more proof well be my guest.",UCu_vVqrOaTZTuuDslq21LOg,1,Ugxx405qBiPKP9Likf54AaABAg,VbiRNT_gWUQ,2015-02-18 16:20:04

Answer: It seems to me that it was a grammatical error. He said ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt go there, and that‚Äôs the way it happened.‚Äù That does sound quite damming on its own. However, in context it makes sense why he said that. Girl asks: Why has nobody been to the moon in such a long time? Buzz responds: ha, that‚Äôs not an 8 year olds question, that‚Äôs MY question. I want to know. But I think I know. Because we didn‚Äôt, go there and, and that‚Äôs the way it happened, And if it didn‚Äôt happen it would be nice to know why it didn‚Äôt happen so in the future if we want to keep doing something, we need to know why something stopped in the past that we wanted to keep going. Clearly this man isn‚Äôt very eloquent. When he said ‚Äúbecause we didn‚Äôt, go there and, that‚Äôs the way it happened‚Äù it very much sounded like he was trying to say ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt end up going back and it would be nice to know why.‚Äù Obviously because of the way he worded this answer it makes things quite ambiguous. I completely understand why you interpreted it they way you did. However I don‚Äôt think he meant it like that. However, this of course is completely a matter of opinion.

I have often wondered what the water look like Bureau that big ice wall that it's trying to contain. Ice will float and it also melts so the ice that is circling this big flat disk is also covering the equator area and I'm surprised that ice hasn't already melted and open the spicket for the rest of the water to seek its own level which water will do so that pretty much blows the total idea that the Flat Earth people have been pitching for the last 5 or 10 years.

There, just told you what it was. This is why you are able to lay in bed and go to sleep. In space where there is no gravity, you never feel that sensation of sleeping because there isn't a force that is pulling you down. This is why when balls bounce, it transfers the potential energy into sound and thermal energy. It can't do that if there isn't a force (gravity) pulling them toward the ground in order to transfer the potential energy. That is why when you climb things, the higher you go, the more GPE (Gravitational Potential Energy) you have. If you climb a mountain it gets harder to go higher up because or gravity and tour GPE increases. If you fall from a mountain, you lose all of that GPE and it turns into kinetic energy (KE) when you fall. Right before you reach the ground, the KE is zero then changes into the amount that you started with. That is why when you hit the ground from a high place, you die. I don't know if you ever had the chance to even pass the first year of high school, but even if you had the smallest crumb of a brain you wouldn't be so simple minded and believe in the flat earth and be anti gravity. There is so much gravity does to hold this world together and there are millions of peices of evidence pointing to so. You keep telling people to look up the flat earth information theirselves, yet you keep asking for photos. You should look that up yourself too. This isn't the 15th century anymore.

Halifax, Vancouver and smaller cities along the ocean coasts would be in trouble. Montreal and Quebec city partially flood, with the high ground of the island of Montreal being fine (basically Mont Royal) and the high ground region of Quebec City (the cliffs facing the river) becoming a large island in the middle of the river. The tributary river valley north of Quebec City (between it and the nearby mountains) floods as does a lot of Montreal island and the surrounding lowlands (the St. Lawrence River lowlands, particularly south of the river, would flood extensively and a few of the Monteregian Hills would become islands). The population of both the big cities in Quebec would likely migrate largely north into the mountains next door. The majority of Ottawa is just slightly above the maximum flooding mark for a full melt but the city would suddenly be on a somewhat wider saltwater estuary instead of a river. Cornwall barely goes under. Brockville would probably have brackish water. The Great Lakes a high enough to all remain freshwater so most of Ontario's population is unaffected. The Hudson's Bay lowlands in northern Ontario probably flood but that's mostly a loss of wilderness. Aside from the BC coastal lowlands and maybe Churchill in Northern Manitoba, the West wouldn't notice. The Arctic Archipelago would probably lose some land but those islands are pretty rugged too.

CO2 levels are rising very sharply since the industrial age started, which is a straightforward measured number. Sea levels drop when water is taken out of the sea. Water is taken out of the see when it falls on land without ever melting ... to run off back into the sea. Sea levels falling for 8000 years makes plenty of sense. It does not contradict the idea that 100 years ago CO2 levels started to spike, at the beginning of the industrial revolution. The question is only if doing things like burning less oil/wood/coal will do anything about the problem. Companies facing being regulated don't like it, and can only honestly argue that measures to regulate them will actually help solve the problem. So naturally, they hire people to not understand the problem. If a completely new energy source, like super-cheap nuclear energy, becomes highly profitable... then these same companies will hire people to actually understand this problem. People figure out how to profit today, so they can live to profit for tomorrow; and companies facing the threat of regulation behave in the same way. I have family in the Philippines that have very spotty access to internet/electricity. They can't reduce their consumption, because they want internet access and electricity so they can learn skills to make money just like we do. In the US, we don't want to reduce our consumption either, because we love our standard of living. The FUD about Global Warming is ridiculous. I think some of the proposed solutions to it are also ridiculous; but that doesn't mean it isn't happening. It just might mean that people are going to have to deal with some places they live going underwater, and it wasn't really avoidable due to human nature. CO2 levels may just be a thing that's proportional to the human population with little we can do about it; similar to oxygen levels being proportional to plant population.",UCutK_3ymoth4IozpXs2xhWA,1,UgiefV1WFaYQn3gCoAEC,VbiRNT_gWUQ,2015-02-18 16:20:04

The people hired to actually understand the problem may or may not discover/execute any solutions to the problem. (ie: new energy technology, frugality, lower birth rates, etc .... don't rule out a new energy technology being so compelling, that it's way more profitable to fix the problem than ignore it!). a perfect example of this will be when we try to buy Greenland, the question of WHY? will come up. the justification will be that... there is incredible natural wealth underneath the ice in Greenland, and the ice is going to melt, so we need to buy Greenland. you can use markets to tell who believes the things they say. nobody makes money bets against what they actually believe.",UCutK_3ymoth4IozpXs2xhWA,1,UgiefV1WFaYQn3gCoAEC,VbiRNT_gWUQ,2015-02-18 16:20:04

Even if he says that global warming is ""a hoax"", he wants to spend billions of dollars on taking advantage of much of Greenland melting to reveal its natural resources. Anybody that says that something is a hoax, but bets billions of dollars on it; is proving that they know it's not a hoax. I would say however that there may be nothing that can be done about it. It's a game of chicken where nobody wants to ""go first"" to reduce their standard of living; all in taking measures that won't be sufficient in the end. (That's the ONLY thing about the global warming ""controversy"" that is real... whether it really is feasible to do something about it. You are dealing with billions of people trying to survive day-to-day, who don't care about tomorrow until they make it through today.). Generally, ""accelerating"" means quadratic change (ie: falling object: -t - (1/2) * (t^2) * g). That means that for a long time, you will see unimpressive levels of melting, until in a few short years, it turns disastrous. Some people will act totally surprised. Everybody will have to adapt in the end. It may throw the food chain into chaos. The earth will certainly adapt. It's not clear how much destruction civilization will experience as it adapts as well.",UCutK_3ymoth4IozpXs2xhWA,1,UgiefV1WFaYQn3gCoAEC,VbiRNT_gWUQ,2015-02-18 16:20:04

Why I think that it¬¥s incorrect is because in Austria for exaple you have alps which are very high aswell (almost 4000m or 13k feet) which constitute 62% of the nation's total area. During winter they sometimes even have to call an army so that the villages and cities can stay in contact, or else they would stay cut off because of the amount of the snow. This happens every year and the snow obviously melts as the temperature rises during the spring. Yet there are no flods or other natural disasters caused by melting ice.

The lower elevation areas like the praries and some of southwestern ontario will be affected, and every province has some area that is low lying. BC is very high elevation and has the Canadian Shield on the coast. Northern Ontario is quite high, I believe.¬† But it isn't the rise in seawater that poses the real threat. It's the superstorms PLUS the higher sea level. And as the climate warms, you can get more tornados and extreme weather in places that are usually too cold for that. Which is why you are seeing more crazy storms and tornados in Ontario and parts of the Northern United States.¬† We don't just need to shore up the cost with levees (or some equivalent solution, including resettling) - we will need better advanced warning systems and buildings that are resistant to extreme weather events.¬† And not just terrestrial events. A very large CME could cause an irreversible blackout that destroys all electronics, unless we devise shielding for them. Not to mention, all the factories that MAKE those electronics would be wiped out. We don't have systematic redundancy. We need more than continuity of government in Cheyenne Mountain. If I were president, I'd be taking action on this immediately. We barely dodged a very large coronal mass ejection in 2012 and every year is playing russian roulette with the sun.¬† By 2040 we need to be in giant domes, or at least to become partially subterranean, to avoid climate and space-borne extreme weather events.¬† At some point, we are going to need to reverse the heating of the planet through geoengineering, since the hydrocarbons we are pumping out are terraforming the planet, and now that process has crossed a tipping point at which it becomes a positive feedback loop. On Venus, that loop heat the surface to something like 230 degrees Celcius (I can't recall the exact number, but skin-meltingly hot).¬† You can actually build systems to prevent these catastrophies pretty easily, with advances in space colonization and better computer modeling of the sun and climate. Because the systems are complex, they are difficult to predict, but our understanding of those systems is improving.¬† So let's say, we predict an 80% chance a solar flare is going to launch charged particles directly at the earth. What are some ways we can prepare? We could retrofit all our technology with some kind of metamaterial coating.¬† We could also deploy a gigantic ""space shield"" that reflects or redirects those charged particles, and can be deployed and repositioned quickly. Ideally, you could build such a device in the vacuum of space, and in a lot of ways that is the simpler solution, but is in itself an engineering challenge. But space manufacturing holds some advantages, like ability to cold weld objects together, the ability to harvest building materials from space itself, through asteroid mining.¬† Or let's say you made it of some kind of graphene reflector, so carbon, you can use a space elevator to supply the feedstock from reduced plant material on earth, and because the graphene is atomically thin, you can make very large surface area with very little material, but someone smarter than I would have to calculate something like that. Anyway, my point is that we are not good at measuring risk at all. There is all this talk of ISIS as being an immediate threat, but climate is a greater threat by far, and here's what's wrong with our thinking. There are what I consider three very important variables to consider when measuring risk. So you want to have these as accurately measured as possible before you make a decision on whether to act on the risk-level to avoid a consequence. One, what are the odds that a negative outcome will occur? Two, what is the spectrum of best to worst case scenarios, and what are their respective probabilities of occuring? Three, what is the *magnitude* of the consequence. So risk is not just evaluating the probability of an event, but quantifying where possible the damage of catastrophic outcomes. So for example, you are more likely to be killed by a fridge than by an asteroid.¬† But which is more important to prepare for, as a society? The outcome of fridge worst case scenario is death, and even deaths of thousands from this cause. But the worst case scenario of an asteroid (even though the chances are FAR LESS of it happening) are cataclysmic. The destruction of civilization and all humanity. Our governments NEED TO START MAKING THESE RISK CALCULATIONS IN A FORMAL WAY. These politicians have no idea what they are doing.. they are mostly trained lawyers (liars). That is their tradecraft, not logic, but the arrangement of words to manipulate favourable *perception.* In a country where the philosophy of Ayn Rand is Personal Happiness + Rational Self Interest = Ultimate Truth.¬† So as long as believing something makes you happy, you have just proven it's OBJECTIVELY TRUE by definition. In fact, Randian objectivism is a paradox of a self-proving ideology. It is fundamentally similar to theocracy.¬† In America, your own subjective experience is God.¬† Which is why the policies are so fucking retarded, because even the Democratics are total acolytes of American Exceptionalism (the consequence of Atlas Shrugged and Alan Greenspan). Which is how you can incinerate innocent women and children overseas, while also calling for ""human decency.""¬† This characteristic makes America technically a fundamentalist state, and I would go so far as to call it a neo-puritanical theocracy. Since Puritanism was proto American Exceptionalism, and you can find very good examples in primary documents like On Plymouth Plantation for the ""city on a hilltop"" philosophy. As such, subjectivism masquerading as universal objectivism has completely destroyed almost every important institution in the US, from the control of currency to fundamental human rights like privacy, free speech, freedom of mobility, habeus corpus, and this list goes on and on. All the corruption stems from a fractal of that one single lie, a truly amazing fact of modern society that few are aware of. Until America accepts that facts are simply facts, and are inarguable, and devises a system to DEFINITELY PROVE THE FACTS and establish a dialogue of common truth, it is doomed to inaction, paralyzed by the two party system designed to break up citizen power and yet consolidate state power (like Loius XIV). You need to replace every one of those moronic lawyers in congress with engineers and scientists who are actually driven by imagination and a passion for truth to solve the world's problems.",UCEOumg5m759wgPmT7KVL_ww,1,UggAipCtHWWp8XgCoAEC,VbiRNT_gWUQ,2015-02-18 16:20:04

If the world is warm enough for all of the ice to melt then that would also make the norther territories far more habitable too. Also it is the 21st century the lakes aren't an issue and are in fact a boon because of all the fresh water. Canada's land is largely rocky it isn't all coastline where it is a nightmare for foundations. So that is a HUGE boon too for building. Canada also has some of the largest deposits of uranium in the world and oil which can easily fuel large industrial metroplexes if they wanted with no shortage of fresh water. So energy, water, land, and moderate climate since it is farther north it would be much nicer if the earth got warmer and a hot hell just further south in the USA.

Scientists aren't in agreement on what caused worldwide sea levels to rise so fast, as much as 40 meters or more in some places in less than 24 hours. One thing there's no disagreement about is that such an event has happened in the past. It's also clear it's happened not once, but multiple times. Because an almost instantaneous global flood has happened numerous times in the history of our planet there's a high likelihood it will happen again one day imo. I will say that a worldwide flashflood like the ones that happened in the past won't happen as a result of climate change. The sea level rise we're witnessing globally as a result of human pollution has been, and will continue to be, a slow rise. Of course, the grand solar minimum cycle that our sun will enter into around 2030 could arrest sea level rise, and might even put it in reverse. Look up ""grand solar minimum"" and educate yourself about where Earth's climate could really be going in the near future.

Their politics is all about CONTROL, and coincidentally that's the ""cure"" for climate change, control.. spreading the wealth, control of industry, etc. In the 70's they screamed GLOBAL COOLING. In the 90's or was GLOBAL WARMING.. Now it's climate change, or climate disruption.. They didn't know then and they certainly still don't know enough. I'll start believing this nonsense when the elites, that are perpetuating it, actually start reducing their own ""carbon footprint"" that's 10's or 100's of times bigger than mine.

The president's are nothing more than a puppet, trump has mentioned the people that rule over him and things before. He doesn't do it so much anymore I think due to them letting him know if he said more they would likely JFK him. He has worked on stopping several aspects of the Kabal, people only see the game today but there is a 3D chess match going on and you have to look at all the moves, not just today, you have to see what has been done, like him raising his tarrifs actually caused China to finally come down on their tarrifs for the first time ever. I don't trust trump, he is a puppet but I have to say it sure seems he might have become more like Pinocchio where he is a puppet but only acts like the puppet so as to keep up the rise against without being assassinated. Think about how badly everyone rails on him for a few things he said, Billy straight up dewomanized a woman in the oval office by shoving his hotdog down her throat, and very few said anything bad about it, he even lied about it then later confessed and everyone was like eh just let him be him, trump makes some jokes and he becomes the worst thing since Hitler, though. Really? But yes we really really so have to keep a very close eye on the weather and what's going on. Florida is normally in the 70s this time of year and we are sitting in the 50s and 60s. The summers are hotter and the winter's are colder. Last time fluctuations in temps were seen like this the planet was going into an Ice Age, and tons of other shifts happened as well, like where the warmer zones were located and such. We have always been getting warmer since the last ice age, but as those temps rise, the ice melts lowering the temps of the waters which determine the temps we see, which is why the colds are getting colder. Sure the sun is beating when it's on is, it's when it's not heating at much that you should truly be looking at the temps and determining what they will be like. Also, IDK if you saw me mention it but check out the poles, the scientific research all say they are shifting and everyone takes that as swapping just like everyone takes this climate change to mean it's getting super hot,when if fact it's quite the opposite, the poles are shifting position slowly but surely. Check out the data collected so far from where they are to where they were and you will see that the north pole is getting closer to Russia and the south pole is getting closer to South America.",UCntEHWyKNXPhUP6Jh2PdkRQ,1,UgykSVr8HQF9lx6W4PZ4AaABAg,VbiRNT_gWUQ,2015-02-18 16:20:04

I also stand with adapting to the changes that come nature brings them. Idk if you have ever noticed but the poles are shifting. The north and south pole are not swapping they are all together shifting. Something that has been happening for a long time and contributed to the changes of the temperatures and the areas that are effected by what temps. Check out bird migrations and things and you will see that they have been slightly altering more and more, as well as data on the actual position of the poles lat and longitude coords over the past 70 years. Long before we were even born the poles have been SHIFTING not swapping as everyone seems to think will happen. North will become more east and east will become south. Not north becomes south and south becomes north. You should really look into that and then start checking the gradiant of the sunrise and sunset along the horizon. In Florida I see a huge difference from when I was younger to now in the position along the east west axis that it has been changing due to the shifting of the planets ""equator"" due to rotations being altered by the poles dragging themselves further and further",UCntEHWyKNXPhUP6Jh2PdkRQ,1,UgykSVr8HQF9lx6W4PZ4AaABAg,VbiRNT_gWUQ,2015-02-18 16:20:04

So Antarctica might be a nicer place to live if the poles shifted. I for one could use a giant inland sea in the Central Valley of California. It would likely help reduce the desert in Southern California as rains might form off that inland sea. I don't see any negatives to this.

During winter the ground becomes so water logged I can see the water running across the surface of the ground and down to the creek all be it only a few millimeters deep. In some areas the ground is squishy and squelchy because it can not hold any more water. The areas that were green down near the creak in summer are now little lakes because the area so sodden the water can not run away so it floods in the lowest point forming the little lakes. I only hope the earth remains stable enough not to become sink holes. So what I am saying is the soil can hold just so much (from rain or ice melt) before it just runs off to a point when it can not run off anymore at which point it collects - then depending on the topography of the land runs and collects to the point the water finds it level - in my case it is no problem in other cases it causes massive floods or torrents of moving water flowing from what ever height through the paths of least resistance till it reaches a point in which it levels out - be that still on land or the oceans. In the account that it levels off on land (farm land) it will only dissipate as quickly as the ground can absorb it (in which case the water is flowing threw micro capillary action deeper into the ground till it reaches the underground aquifers or the ocean or threw evaporation) I think the video dose not show enough, I think there would be a whole lot more flooding than it shows because of the areas that can not absorb any more water would become like those little lakes and flood and level out like that permanently or until the next Ice age puts all the water back in its place as ice once again.",UCPJkW-KcKu88gTTwkdxUiMg,1,UgiQZBc03aA933gCoAEC,VbiRNT_gWUQ,2015-02-18 16:20:04

Create isn't near the Pillars of Hercules and the Minoans weren't wiped out 10k years ago. The only places that fit that don't claim to be located in the Atlantic (something we know to be BS becuase there aren't any signs of submerged land in seafloor mapping) are the Spanish mudflats and northern Morocco. Everything else either isn't located in the right place or was wiped out at the wrong time or not at all. Personally I favor the mudflats as it's a more civilized (in terms of historical scale) region, Morocco is an arid place with few settled peoples prior to the Romans. That's not to say Atlantis will ever be found or even existed, the Minion theory just doesn't work as an historical answer to the question. It CAN (and is) argued that the Atlanteans are totally mythological and the Minions lent their culture to Plato's story but that's a different issue.",UCkvnCOWf_eCESkvCD7XDefw,1,UgiV39bhiFoqnXgCoAEC,VbiRNT_gWUQ,2015-02-18 16:20:04

At Knossos, their capital in Crete, the palace was so complicated, it resembled a labyrinth. They worshipped bulls and when the early Greeks sacked Knossos, one can imagine a Greek warrior fighting his way to the King's inner sanctum where he met s Minos himself, wearing a Bull mask. From there to the Minotaur is but a short step. Plato got the sinking story from the Egyptians via Herdotus ""The Father of Lies"" and embellished it somewhat. He probably would be amused that so many took him seriously, crediting the ""Atlanteans"" with the ability to fly in flying machines etc. If they read the whole thing they would have noted that the ""Atlanteans"" were at war with Athens and they weren't winning!",UC9y-JG3kMb32ZOZTfzLSO5A,1,UgiV39bhiFoqnXgCoAEC,VbiRNT_gWUQ,2015-02-18 16:20:04

Let's say I'm not going to convince you about global warming...but just look at any unbiased, scientifically produced evidence and no one will tell you the glaciers (or rather the pole caps) are growing. But here is areason to start using alternative energy than c02 producing energy... If every house had a solar panel for a roof, and wind farms to produce energy, all connected to a grid that can evenly produce energy and using batteries to store energy when the sun is down, that allows a country to be completely sustain their own energy without needing to drill for oil or mine for coal (which is as shitty of a job and a dangerous one at that) to get oil. Also using new energy not only allows a country to sustain itself with free energy (once it's invested into), it would be cheaper because it's literally natural and always present, unlike oil which countries like the middle east profit heavily from and others like my country, the US, UK, and others get involved in wars that are to beat ""terrorism"" when its really about installing a leader that will be friendly and allow us cheap access to oil which causes massive debt from wars, casualties, and keeps the military industrial complex stocked. Do we get involved in conflicts in Africa, of which there are just as many as in the middle east? no, because there simply isn't any return on investment. So it becomes a question of whether or not you want a country that doesn't depend on others for energy, but can sustain itself without having to worry about eventually running out of oil. Even Canada which has large deposits, still exports a bunch so it's not as if they have an unlimited supply, besides, like I said it is a fiscally conservative thing to do. You create renewable energy, you pay less for it in the end. Yes the initial investment may cost, but that also brings in jobs, so it's good for the economy then, and good for the economy once the system is in place because when the energy is coming from wind and the sun, there's no shortage of that, and thus you pay less for all energy all around, whether it's for an electric car (which are increasingly better than a combustion engine, considering you never have to worry about it fucking up because of the filth that runs through an engine), no oil changes, just charging your car off the same energy you'd have from a renewable energy infrastructure. Plus, utilities would cost nearly nothing, except maybe the cost of the companies or government to maintain the energy grid. I think people should worry and realize global warming is a threat, but for deniers and for people that believe in global warming, it's also a positive reason to frame the debate into an economic one. it's just the smart thing to do. If the world isn't warming, how does that hurt anyone? It saves lives and helps them by giving jobs to people, as well as not getting involved in wars that have nothing to do with us, nor depending on countries charging outlandish prices. s",UCj9Gluh47DBqkWDlOKQLUpQ,1,UgjQWvSp80NJOXgCoAEC,VbiRNT_gWUQ,2015-02-18 16:20:04

I really do not get how people who believe in science, can think the environment and climate, could, would, or should, remain stable and comfortable, for one self-absorbed species. The simple fact of 'global warming' is that any effect Man has had on the climate, has likely delayed the next glacial maximum, which is an exponentially greater threat to Humanity, than expanding temperate zones, increased rainfall and loss of a few hundred feet of seafront. When we talk about the effects of global temperature increase, we are talking about a comfort zone, not a Biblical catastrophy. The only people who will find it catastrophic, are the people who measure success, by luxury, comfort and routine laziness.

I have done very similar research and come to the same conclusion as yourself, but one thing I can't find is any records where the Poles are above freezing level long enough to melt completely. So as with all theories, they are great but the reality maybe somewhat different. Meaning the theoretical maximum of 250' sea level rise is ""Probably"" not achievable? The thing I like to consider is at the end of the day the sun will die and the earth, if it still exists will just turn into an ice ball wandering through space until it hits something or gets pulled in by another galaxy. We humans have a big problem as we only live for an extremely short period of time, and as such we are unable to look at the big picture, overall trends are very different to the tiny peaks and troughs along the way. If you take any 100 year period and look at house prices in the UK, you will see an upward trend of a good magnitude. But you can selectively pick shorter periods of say 10 years where you could see a drop in prices. The graph I find most interesting is the world population graph, it follows the temp graphs quite closely, funny that? I honestly can't understand how anyone cannot see that 7.5 billion people must use 7.5 times as much energy and resources as 1 billion? and the consumption of all resources to sustain this life must increase by the same, if not larger amount? Therefore the carbon dioxide levels don't match the population figures and they should rise equally? The big question is why not one of the organisations that seem to get over represented in the media never mention this? Most even advocate more and more immigrants to join our party? I think you will find it is all about the money, GROWTH etc, not saving the planet.

I said (all be it as a joke) that we should throw away solar panels & you come back at me saying I'm wrong & humidity is all I need to worry about & that somehow increasing the humidity in the middle of Australia is going to cause everything to dry up faster? Please Explain! Just so you know, ""water vapour"" when taken as a climate measurement is referred to as ""humidity"" humidity = % of water vapour in the air. It impacts how hot you feel, how quickly your washing dries etc but lets say you go into a sauna & pour a litre of water on the rocks & push the humidity up by 20%, the temperature gauge on your thermometer won't move, even though it will feel MUCH hotter. As for Carbon dioxide blocking out sunlight, how does it do that? You mean the way it provides extra particles between earth & space to get through? That's why it's referred to as a ""blanket effect"" when those particles of radiant heat are unable to travel through the mass of CO2 particles in the atmosphere to escape the earth. Note to anyone else reading, who has more accurate info than me from the 97% of legit scientists, please feel free to correct/add more technical info.

I actually don't know where you are going with this and if you were looking, I don't know, for me not to comment after the fact that this conversation had ended a month ago I can only advise you to look for dates of comments which are right next to the nickname. If you are putting the nickname of the person before the comment, assume that person will understand that the comment is addressed to him or her. If you are assuming that there is no purpose to comment on this well 1) don't do it yourself, 2) You do not decide for others and actually as I referred the advice of not arguying after a month that the conversation was ended grazes absurdity and 3) it does for me because writing publicly that a refugee crisis of hundreds of millions of people (and I did not comment on similar comments about Florida for example, because they were obvious jokes - even if yes they don't take in the fact that there is massive voter suppression there and no, the recently passed law is just a bandaid and didn't solve the problem at all- anyone can see that they are jokes. This one, however you look at it, is not and cannot be teasing, and the rest of his arguments speaks foritself to validate my point), leading to out of anything our species has ever experienced massive deaths of main characters of their lives like you, him and I are as ""poetic"" is not just offensive, it's obsene. This is I guess why another person intervened before me, and yes his poorly constructed arguments about social class, even if he didn't understand it, had to be corrected. Now, I don't believe that that person is as - sorry, but - dumb as some other commentators, but again this was not just idiotic, greasy and offensive, it was obsene. So yes I do consider that one has to react to that (especially when written publicly), because what we are discussing about is nothing of a fiction but again something concerning main characters of their lives, like he is.

But their emissions per person are still the highest in the world, and I don't think that the current administration will improve the situation.

In order to flood the earth including mountains like the bible says it'd take 4,500,000,000 km3, which is about 3.25 times the total amount of water in the oceans today! (meaning we have about 1,406,250,000 km3 on the surface of the earth today) We know the rate of evaporation. Now, scientists do predict that the worlds water supply will eventually dry up, but thats ONLY with the natural increase in solar luminosity that will cause the Earth's temperatures to rise over the next few hundred million years. This will result in the complete evaporation of the oceans.. but it will take at least 1 BILLION years for it to happen (and anyone who would experience this would die.. let alone if it happened in 150 days! You would boil alive.). And that's just with the water we have (only a third that the bible claims was needed to flood the earth). So even for our current water to evaporate in 150 days you'd take 1,406,250,000 km3 and divide it by 150 you still have 9,375,000 km3! And well, considering only 1,170 km3 of water evaporates a day (into the atmosphere btw.. a miniscule amount in comparison is lost to space) you divide 9,375,000 by 1,170 and get a remainder of 8,012 km3 of water unaccounted for. In other words, you'd be claiming that every single day there would be *6.8 TIMES* more water evaporation than the actual rate of evaporation that occurs on a daily basis.. and again.. thats just for the water we have today to vanish. So double that 6.8 (because we'd be going from at least 3 times the amount of water down to a third of that which we have now) and you got 13.6 times more evaporation than what actually occurs on the daily for it to go from the biblical proportions down to even roughly what we have today in 150 days. You would literally have to boil the ocean and even then it wouldn't account for it!",UCdMf86ymXpw0gSHYWfTYgSw,1,Ugzx588AyQzUtEadPX54AaABAg,VbiRNT_gWUQ,2015-02-18 16:20:04

It is obvious that most of Earth's water is in the oceans, so let's look at rain. Rain is atmospheric water condensing and falling. The atmosphere contains about 13,000 km3 of water. If ALL of this water were to rain out of the atmosphere at the same time, it amount to about 2.5 cm of rain planetwide. That's ONE INCH! Now the claim is that ALL mountains on Earth were covered. That must include Everest, which is approximately 8.86 km. high. The claim is, therefore, that Earth was covered with water to a depth of 8.86 km. This amounts to a water volume of roughly 4,500,000,000 km3, which is about 3.25 times the total amount of water in the oceans today! And - the atmosphere contains only 13,000 km3. That's tiny compared to the total. Where does all that extra water come from? And where does it go when the flood recedes? If you postulate that is now in the Earth, it would occupy a cube about 1,650 km. on a side. That's just over 1,000 miles per side, or 1/8 of Earth's radius! That would show up FAST in seismic studies, and no such reservoir has been seen. The story says that the water receded in 150 days. That's approximately 30,000,000 km3 per day! That's a LOT of water to dump. Here we have to work an assumption. Suppose there was a ""drain"" hole 10 km square (about 6.2 miles on a side). Again, simple calculations work. The product of hole area, water velocity and time will give the volume of water going through the hole. The volume per day we have, the postulated hole area is 100 km2, there are 86,400 seconds in a day. We will solve for the water velocity, which turns out to be about 3.5 km/sec! That's just over 2 miles per second, or 7,200 miles per hour! Not likely. The last part of the story to analyze is the return of the creatures to Earth. Think about this. What does Noah have to do? He has to return penguins to Antarctica, koalas, platypuses, wallabies and kangaroos to Australia, bison to North America, polar bears to the Arctic, reindeer to Lapland, tigers to India, pandas to China, and so on. And just how does he do this? His large boat is now grounded. There's one more consideration - rainfall rate. Assuming the impossible - that the atmosphere could actually rain like that - how fast would the rain have to fall to make 8.8 km is 40 days? That's easy. Forty days times 24 hours per day is 960 hours. Divide 8,800 meters (8.8 km) by 960 and you find a rainfall rate of about 9 meters per hour! That's 28.8 feet per hour! We think that 6 INCHES per hour is a really heavy rain. Rain at that rate would sink any boat you could name. The calculations are easy; you can try them yourself. The point is that these difficulties cannot be overcome in any reasonable way. The only way to deal with it is to claim that ""God did it,"" which is not scientific. The ""God did it"" claim is a non-hypothetical truth, which cannot be tested. At that point you leave science behind. So What Happened? So what did happen? Those ancient stories very likely refer to an actual flood event, but not a planetwide one. Many cultures have flood stories for the simple reason that many early civilizations lived near rivers, and those who live near rivers WILL get flooded. There are two prime suspects for the ancient flood. One is a local river flood in the Mesopotamian Valley about 2,900 BCE and the flooding of the Black Sea about 7,500 years ago. Look at a page from The Institute for Biblical and Scientific Studies. For the Black Sea possibility, read In Search of Noah's Flood. This is recent work and is VERY interesting.

Good parts of the city including the Old City are built on highlands since the city was intended to be defensible. You'd need a huge rise in sea levels to put most of it underwater. Some of its lower lying suburbs (much of the inner northern suburbs lie in a valley between the highlands the city is on and the mountains the outer suburbs are build in) along with the historic Old Port district might need to tread water. I'm not sure if it would end up becoming an island or a penninsula (depends on high high the land is to the west of the city). http://en-ca.topographic-map.com/places/Quebec-City-8146155/ I'd be more worried about Halifax and the other cities out in the Atlantic region along with BC's coastal cities like Vancouver. Montreal isn't much further above sea level at the lower points than Quebec City either so it's coastal bits would be at risk too. Ottawa and the Great Lakes areas are too high in altitude to be at much risk.,UCwyw2iHMa1D0mjMxbdow_pA,1,Ugz-Irff0i9g2jdqfYN4AaABAg,VbiRNT_gWUQ,2015-02-18 16:20:04

In between these cycles we find a frequency at which they cross and combine their heating or cooling effects. On one spectrum, there is No Ice on the planet at all. then the other spectrum we Plunge into an Ice age lasting around 30,000 years and we return to the normal 1.2 M year cycle.

My ancestors were diplomats and have lived across the world - from their home in Britain, Portugal and then eventually India - since Elizabeth I's rule. They lived in a time of great prosperity and were quite well-off until Gandhi's Revolution turned their lives upside-down and they had to leave for the UK for fear of being rounded up and executed. They left everything behind and ended up living in relative poverty. Yes, perhaps the British Empire caused similar displacement and poverty - but then again, so did the Moghuls who came before them. All nation states do or have done bad things. Get over it. India is indeed in a post-colonial stage. That means that colonialism is *in the past*. The clue is in the etymology: the prefix ""post"", deriving from the Latin word of the same name, meaning ""after"", and most likely ultimately coming from the Proto-Indo-European word *h‚ÇÅepi, meaning ""on"" or ""near"". So, you can just call it, as you put it, ""a past"" (a strange way to use the indefinite article, but I'll ignore that), because *it happened in the bloody past and you even fucking admitted to it by using the phrase ""post-colonial stage""*. And yes, you do indeed need to learn tolerance from a European (albeit a mixed-race European), because unlike you, I don't associate a multitude of ethnic and cultural groups spanning an entire continent with an ideology that has, for the most part, completely died out and only really existed in one out of the fifty-odd countries that make up the continent. Not to mention the fact that it was Britain (along with France, the USA and a few other friends) that fought against Germany in the Second World War. In answer to your question, ""how many people's career and life was ruined just because of showing the Nazi salute?"" (sic.), I regrettably am unable to tell you. I was, until today, unaware that ""showing"" a Nazi salute could ruin anyone's life. Before now, I had always assumed that raising one's right hand in a stiff upwards motion (which is actually not exclusive to the German Werhmacht and similar salutes have been, and still are, used by soldiers from military organisations across the world) was merely a hand gesture, and could in no way cause any physical harm to any sort of person, unless they happened to be standing in the way and got hit in the face by the saluter's outstretched hand. However, thanks to you, I have now been made aware that such a gesture can actually destroy a person's career and life, although, alas, you did not provide any sort of detail on exactly how a salute can take someone's occupation and life away. Perhaps it channels some sort of extrasensory power within the human mind? But then surely the Germans would have won the war with great ease, as all they would have had to do was simply outstretch their hands and give praise to their Leader, and then the Allied forces would have fallen down and surrendered, as the gesture's great power would have taken away both their lives and their careers? Perhaps you can elaborate. Now, after wasting ten minutes writing this comment, I suggest that you: A) Learn some tolerance for other countries and folk and make an effort to understand that while the past's events do indeed shape the present, they are outside of anybody's control and, as such, no-one should agonise over past events as they cannot be changed, and they should certainly never be forgotten. B) Improve your English, since the rhythm, grammar, structure, punctuation and overall presentation in your writing is rather difficult to derive any sort of clear meaning from, and it is often rather hard to understand what you're actually trying to say. I look forward to reading your poorly-written reply which will most likely disregard everything that I have taken time out of my day to think about and put into words. I am beginning to wonder if perhaps you are a troll.",UCRYNgAqg4QsbxjMHpSVUoqQ,1,Ugw-vYZZpesz_N1awkt4AaABAg,VbiRNT_gWUQ,2015-02-18 16:20:04

They go extinct and other species take their place and makes new species over thousands of years. Personally I want to preserve the species we have today. Even in the worst case scenario there will be other species that will dominate and shine but our biodiversity would drop dramatically and then increase again in the future with whatever species survive. I love biology but would hate to live in a world with lower biodiversity. We know temperature and acidification of oceans as consequence of more co2 easily affects ecosystems and animal behavior. Just look at the corals and massive bleachings lately. They are dying and will undoubtedly go extinct unless we cultivate them privately. That's why I fully support green energy and will continue to do so here in Denmark.

As demonstrated people can turn on the air conditioner or drink more water and they wouldn't notice much of an increase. The problem of temperature increase hits insects and birds the most. Regarding insects there is one particularly important insect that is responsible for our food production of as high as 70%. That is, the bee of course. There are documented cases of bees only being able to survive at most 50 centigrade and only for short periods of time ~1 hour, at which point they succumb to the conditions and die. These conditions can vary between humidity, natural wind breaks and sunlight but overall a hot bee is not a working bee. As temperature increases continue into the forseeable future food production will become problematic and no doubt food shortages will become common place and from there pick your flavour of rioting when food isn't delivered. Currently there is a disturbing trend where numerous bee hive extinction is occurring all over the world that is thought to be a compounded effect of invasive species, pesticides, temperature increase and climate change.",UCZGwssw7iktwDGKhJ2eppgg,1,Ugw7K1cHtyHenl7jN7Z4AaABAg,VbiRNT_gWUQ,2015-02-18 16:20:04

All IPCC models are based on correlation, not causation. So when speaking scientifically it isn't valid. Furthermore, even if they were right, and CO2 almost controls the entirety of the climate, they only predict a 2-4C rise in temperatures from the temperature levels seen during the LIA (hint hint, that is almost nothing). For some perspective, the Holocene climate optimum was as much as 4-6C warmer than today (on a global scale, however even warmer in the polar regions). That means those temperatures roughly 6000 years ago would still be 1-3C warmer than what even the IPCC expects. Postive feed backs are falcicious, even when CO2 levels were 17 times higher than today in the past we never had runaway warming. We also had no exponential warming during the Holocene climate optimum when massive amounts of permafrost would've melted (for some perspective it was so warm the Greenland ice sheet shrunk by roughly 170,000 sq kilometers, or the size of the state of Missouri). Also, no we have teenagers advocating for fighting it because they've basically been brainwashed into thinking if the worlds temperatures rise 1-2C the world will end, and they think humans are the primary driver (we have no evidence for that whatsoever).",UCpadRwVfACgE7PY2LLw6IVA,1,UgwHRFa_o9N9GrhMLvd4AaABAg,VbiRNT_gWUQ,2015-02-18 16:20:04

The interaction between cold oceans and warm oceans makes water in our world rotate and move. When this is disrupted, it will be catastrophic. You think oxygen only comes from trees? The MAJORITY of our oxygen is generated from our oceans, by phytoplanktons. When the ocean's temperatures and acidity is disrupted (due to excess CO2 as well), then phytoplanktons appear less.

Assuming the rate of melting in Antarctica was the same as in Greenland (it's a lot less), it would take... A good 337,000 years to melt completely. 2. IPCC predicts that temperatures will rise only another 0.5-1¬∞C and predicts only 0.5-2 meters of sea level rise, meaning over the course of the next 80 around 800 million people (population inflation accounted for) will have to migrate inland, that's around 17,500 people back day for the next 80 years. First of all, that is nothing, 150 people migrate to Tampa, Florida alone every day. Second of all, that would mean the global population density per square miles would be... wait for it... 167 people per square mile (roughly 4 acres of land per person. So that just blew your almarmism out of the water. But hey, let's go even further, by 2150 we are targeted to peak at 550-600 ppm (450-400 ppm lower than the peak of the Cretaceous period), 2-4¬∞C, and roughly a 5 meter rise in sea levels. However, the human population is targeted to drop to 2-5 billion people due to the demographic transition, meaning our global population density will have dropped to 35 people per square mile, or roughly 16 acres per person (a plot of land 900 feet wide and long). 3. You fail to realize CO2 isn't even remotely the main driver of our climate, that title goes to the Sun. For the past 60 years we've seen a slow down in solar activity, for the past 20 years we've seen little warming if any warming (likely because of this slow in solar activity). NASA predicts we could be on the brink of a Maunder minimum like period, where solar activity and sun spot counts could reach near zero. If this happens, you can basically bet on the entire world cooling by 1¬∞C (offsetting the next 100 years of warming). 3. You fail to realize that plant growth has surged because of increased CO2 and warming. Globally, plant growth has increased 30% since the 1980s, our output of crops per square unit of land has increased by 34%. As of right now deserts like the Saharah are actually greening, over all, the Earth has actually gotten greener. Which raises another point. 4. By 2150 CO2 concentration will likely be plummeting and so will global temperatures. At the rate we're heading, by 2150, when CO2 peaks at 550-600 ppm and temperatures peak at 2-4¬∞C, plant growth could be nearly 200% higher than it was in the 1980s (3x higher). Combine that with the increasing size of forest-supporting area and you can get some astonishing results. If we were to replant all our forest, we could possibly sea 1.9 trillion tons of CO2 get sucked out of the air within 10-40 years (off setting 40 years of pumping CO2 in the air today). Once again your almarmism is irrational. 5. Where we are at now, we can easily support 8.5-9 billion people with our food supply. By 2100, even more so, especially considering rising temperatures, CO2 levels, and are of arable land. So no, we are not in a state of over population, and we likely won't reach a state of over population.",UCpadRwVfACgE7PY2LLw6IVA,1,UgwHRFa_o9N9GrhMLvd4AaABAg,VbiRNT_gWUQ,2015-02-18 16:20:04

Denk aan het weer, het is onmogelijk om het weer van morgen 100% correct te voorspellen,¬†laat staan dat we in staat zijn de¬†effecten van¬†klimaatfactoren over decennia of zelfs eeuwen juist te voorspellen, er zijn gewoonweg teveel onzekere factoren, het enige dat we kunnen zeggen ""het is aan het veranderen"" op welke manier, dat weten we nu nog niet, en een verandering is niet op alle gebieden van de aarde dus hetzelfde. Dat de mens invloed heeft op die verandering, daar is men het wel over eens, maar over hoeveel, daar verschillen de meningen over. Er zijn namelijk ook hele grote externe invloeden¬† sommige weten we, maar mogelijk zijn er nog veel ontdekt, hieronder een paar voorbeelden : -we zijn te laat voor een ijstijd (maar dan praten we over eens per 100.000 jaar)¬†als die inzet, kunnen alle zorgen over klimaatverandering overboord. -er zijn periodes van meer en minder zonneactiviteit, over enkele eeuwen,¬†de laatste periode van weinig activiteit zorgde voor de kleine ijstijd van de 16e tm 19e eeuw , die zorgde voor veel honger, mislukte oogsten, het uitsterven van de afstammelingen van de vikings op groenland, etc, mensen kunnen slecht tegen een paar graden kouder. Waar het aan het einde van de romeinse tijd (1e tm¬†4e eeuw)¬†en de¬†vroege vikingtijd (9e tm 11e eeuw) we een opbloeing zien niet alleen in die beschavingen maar mondiaal, een paar graden warmer valt dus vaak samen met de bloeitijd van beschavingen, mensen kunnen een paar graden warmer WEL goed handelen. De opklimmende curve die begon aan het einde van de kleine ijstijd (rond 1850) valt dus samen met de ""klimaatverandering"" tis de vraag hoeveel ervan veroorzaakt word door het herstellen van de zon naar zijn normale activiteit, als de zon opeens weer besluit actiever/inactiever te worden kan dat zomaar +/- 2-5 graden schelen op aarde -stof in de atmosfeer, de tweede wereldoorlog had niet zomaar koude winters, al dat extra stof in de atmosfeer blokkeerde zonlicht, ook de natuur deed dit toen de krakatoa uitbarsten hadden we dat jaar geen zomer, en zelfs de bescheiden uitbarsting van de vulkaar op ijsland zorgde mondiaal voor een afkoeling van enkele tiende graden voor een aantal maanden. De afkoeling¬†door stof is zeer groot, dit is ook wat men ervaard bij een ""nucleare winter""""zou er een atoomoorlog komen. -methaangas, ook wel bekend als aardgas, dit is een veel groter broeikasgas dan co2, als een grote pocket van methaangas zou ontsnappen bvb door een aardbeving zou dat ineens grote gevolgen hebben -natuurlijk co2 (laat je niet gekmaken, de hoeveelheid co2 die de mens verspreid tenopzichte van wat de natuur doet is marginaal) bij vulkaanuitbarstingen komen idiote hoeveelheden co2 vrij, dit is ook waar het co2 dat voor de warme periode van het Perm zorgde vandaan kwam, een lange periode (zo'n 10.000-30.000 jaar) van hoge vulkanische activiteit (meer dan 10 uitbarstingen per jaar) -grote pockets natuurlijk co2 : zeewater slaat co2 op, water heeft die eigenschap, en veel word in pockets op de bodem van de oceaan opgesloten, echter als het te warm word komt dat allemaal in een keer vrij, en dat gaat om enorme hoeveelheden, hier en daar zie je dat effect al als opeens een meer of zee gaat ""koken"" -in de tundra ligt veel co2 opgeslagen in de vorm van turf, als dat ontdooit gaat het rotten en dat geeft VEEL meer co2 dan de olie en kolenindustrie,¬†(de tuinaardeindustrie draagt door het afgraven van deze tundra voor de productie ervan stevig bij aan de co2 uitstoot, denk daar eens aan als je met plantjes planten groen bezig denkt te zijn) -zeestromingen en windstromingen, er gaat warmte van de evenaar via zee en windstromingen naar de polen, terwijl circulaire stromingen de kou gevangen houd op de polen, deze kunnen verstoord worden door klimaatverandering, rivieren veranderen hun bedding ook wel eens en heel soms besluit water opeens aan een heel andere kant de berg af te stromen. dat werkt voor deze rivieren van water en wind niet heel anders. zonder deze stromingen zou het in nederland gezien de breedegraad waar wij op liggen een stuk kouder zijn en op de polen een stuk warmer, de zuidpool was nog relatief warm met beperkte begroeing op sommige gebieden tot wel 12.000 jaar geleden, het ontstaan van de ringstroming die de kou er gevangen houd, versnelde de ijsgroei, en maakt het daar zoveel kouder dus nee ik ben geen klimaatontkenner, maar ik acht de invloed van de mens op deze verandering in het licht van deze grote factoren marginaal. (het effect wat wij hebben op de biotoop daarintegen is vreselijk, en daar zouden we dan ook beter onze aandacht op richten, effecten die OOk veroorzaakt worden met¬†de voor de groene economie zo noodzakelijke aardmetalen, en natuurlijk hebben verkeerde methodes van olie, gas en kolenwinning zoals fracking ook enorme nadelige effecten op de biotoop) al die co2 praatjes nemen niet weg dat alle olie, kolen en gas ooit door iemand verbrand zullen worden, als niet door deze generatie en dit land, dan wel door een volgende in een ander land. Daarnaast, door zelf minder te gebruiken verlaagd de prijs van dergelijke brandstof wat het alleen maar weer aantrekkelijker maakt voor anderen waardoor het gebruik weer toeneemd. het maakt dus derhalve niet uit of je een ontkenner of erkenner bent van klimaatverandering, we kunnen beter ons geld investeren in de GEVOLGEN van klimaatvarandering, dan in de co2 hetze. Groene energie heeft ook zin, om economisch voorbereid te zijn op de toekomst, maar de verkeerde investeringen worden daarin gedaan, die co2 normen van brussel schaden dus ook de bestendigheid van onze economie. Totale ONZIN (meteen mee stoppen) : Biodiesel, landbouw kost meer energie dan het produceerd, die bijmengingen is dus totaal zinloos. Windenergie, er is enorm veel energie nodig om de materialen ervoor te maken,¬†en het delven van de grondstoffen ervoor leverd ook nog eens veel vervuiling, tel dan nog eens de energie om ze te plaatsen, en je ziet dat ze vaak niet eens de energie opleveren die ze kosten om neer te zetten over hun levensduur. Zonneenergie, door middel van zonnepanelen,¬†is een van de meest vervuilende energiemethodes die er is, doordat ervoor zeldzame grondstoffen nodig zijn die vooral in china op ENORM vervuilende wijze gewonnen worden. Elektrisch rijden/accu's : ook hiervoor geld, de accu's nodig om dit te faciliteren vragen grondstoffen die zeer schaars zijn, en alles behalve duurzaam gewonnen kunnen worden. Spaarlampen : hoewel energiezuinig, zijn het gewoon tl-buizen in een andere vorm en bevatten enorm giftige stoffen, zowel productie, gebruik, als verwerking ervan kost veel meer energie en veroorzaakt meer vervuiling dan dan de traditionele lamp. Nuclear : het produceren van brandstofstaven kost enorm veel energie, de winning van uranium uit erts nog veel meer, hierdoor leverd een nucleaire centrale een negatief energierendement op, en dan heb ik het nog niet eens over ontploffingsgevaar en Wat WEL zin heeft : *zonnespiegeltorens (traditionele stoomturbine aangedreven door geconcentreerd zonlicht via spiegels, goed te plaatsen op lokaties met veel zon en weinig neerslag, zoals in de sahara) *waterkrachtcentrales (al meer dan 100 jaar een van de meest betrouwbare energiemethodes, weinig energie nodig, veel rendement, nadeel is wel dat daarvoor een hoop mensen moeten verhuizen en natuurgebieden onder water komen te staan) *alternatieve windmolens (van het type wat als een spiraal omhoog gaat,¬†die in verhouding¬†veel minder materiaal nodig hebben om te plaatsen en niet naar de wind hoeven te draaien) *geothermale centrales (van het type zoals gebruikt in ijsland, er zijn nog wel andere afgelegen locaties die ervoor geschikt zouden zijn) *magnetisch onderlegde snelwegen (de techniek van draadloos opladen), zodat eletrische auto's kunnen rijden zonder behoefde aan grote accu's. *ligfietsen, in coconvorm, mits goed gebouwd kun je daarmee 50 tot 70km/h halen, ruim voldoende voor een groot deel van het persoonlijk transport, alleen is stoppen en weer vertrekken er lastiger mee als op traditionele fietspaden het geval is, dus aanleg van speciale fiets-snelwegen zou ervoor vereist zijn. *een waterstofeconomie kan ook helpen, er zijn redelijk botsingbestendige tanks voor, hoewel het geen energie opleverd, hoeft er integenstelling tot biodiesel niet ook nog eens landbouwgrond voor opgeofferd worden, terwijl het wel voldoet aan de vraag naar een energie-compacte en mobiele brandstof, daarnaast met magnetisch onderlegde snelwegen heb je maar een klein tankje ervan nodig, genoeg om naar/van de snelweg te rijden. *de luchtvaart zal ws als enige bio-kerosine of alcohol¬†blijven gebruiken, waterstof en vliegen is niet de veiligste combinatie, niet een ideale oplossing. En voor de toekomst : *kernfusiereactoren zijn mogelijk iets voor de toekomst,¬†iig iets om onderzoek naar te blijven doen, eigenlijk is het meer het gat overbruggen tot we de energie-rendabel kernfusie kunnen doen. *Thorium-Zout reactoren zin een dood spoor, maar zijn minder gevaarlijk en leveren een beter rendement op dan de traditionele kerncentrales, onderzoek hierin ligt dichterbij een energie-rendabele oplossing. mogelijk een optie om het gat tussen het einde van olie en het begin van kernfusie op grote schaal te overbruggen.",UCURjJbYLXNlTFDhy_RqYO0w,1,Ugiz0ocEVFhBUngCoAEC,VbiRNT_gWUQ,2015-02-18 16:20:04

Iin nederland zal zelfs dan de stijging marginaal zijn of waarschijnlijk zelfs een lichte daling inhouden (de bodem van groenland word omlaag gedrukt door al dat ijs en daarom nederland ook, als dat ijs weg is, ""veren"" we dus omhoog, wat die stijging compenseerd) Maar zelfs in dit doom-scenario blijft de zuidpool stijf bevroren.

6243,Ugiz0ocEVFhBUngCoAEC.8KT5NFYcgfD8NbGz6YRGV0,,5,2017-01-11 20:10:13,DutchStudent1982,"nah we would be fine. -first the nothpole would melt, it would have little to no effect on sea levels for us but¬†it would have large climatic effects for us due cold polar winds no longer trapped in the north, and different ocean currents, we would have much more extreme weather, we might get colder winters and hurricanes in summer, and other extreme weathertypes like mutch larger hail, moussoun type rainsstorms and generally even more wind (and we already have a lot of wind and rain here) (while I would embrace the ice, since we haven't had a good winter in almost 2 decades, the rest of that extreme weather does not sound to properly, but given our high technological and economic society, we will just adapt, some old buildings may suffer but we'll develop new architect styles and methods to combat it, like we always have) -second the greenland icecaps would melt, while that does add 2m to global sea levels, for us it would cause a little more than halve a meter sea level DROP, due the weight of that icecap pressing the land down, and it will bounce up once that ice is gone. Also less ice would probably mean a little warmer climate, netherlands would get summers like south of france, winters like scandanavia and a lot of golfball-sized hailstorms, the average windspeed would rise from 4 to 7, and storms of force 10 would increase from 3 times a year to¬†5 times a month, and winds of force 11 that we now have only once a decade we would have about once month 12 that we now call storm of the century we would have 1 or two a year off. Add to this a couple of tornado's, and moussoun like rains... our biggest problem would not be the sea.. it would be the rivers... all that extra rain through our river delta means we would have to dig the rivers a lot deeper and widers, adaptations we already are making (controlled giving land back to the riverdelta, planned flood area's so we can prevent more valueble area's from flooding, and ofcourse stronger river dykes. So it would probaly involve a second deltaworks but we would manage, many poor nations by now would have deathtolls in the millions however as they would have much higher sea level rises (some as much as 8m) and not the funds to combat the new situation. -third the atlantic sea ice would melt, adding about 4m of sea levels, but again it would not spread out evenly, sea's have mountain ridges and vallays too, earth is¬†not a perfect sphere and water does not distribute evenly. For us it would result in about 2-3M of sea level rise, combined with the reduction we already had from greenland, thats still a solid 2.5m sea level rise compared to now However we can still combat that, many of our nation is already 5m or more below sea level and some area's as much as 15m below sea level.. so adding 2.5m would not be a problem, we can raise the dykes. It would however have bad effects on nature and agricultre. While Zeeland, and Groningen and Friesland are mostly protected from the north sea with dykes, north and south holland mostly still rely on the dunes. These dunes would suffer During high tides and storms sometimes parts of the dunes get washed away.. and we maintain these natural defences to prevent them from eroding away over time. Special plants keep grip on the sands, and underwater dykes placed some 100m off the coast (called wave-breakers) block most of the energy from the sea, along with sandbanks (some artificcial) that perform this same task. A 2.5m sea level rise would in itself not be that bad for the dunes, but together with stronger storms (that would come with a world without ice and higher temperatures due more heat = more energy = more storms/severe weather) it would mean the deathblow to the dunes, we could build dykes there too and we would, but it would be the deathblow to our famous unspoiled dutch beaches, and a lot of nature would suffer due the dunes being a large nature preserve for many species, it would be a loss to culture, felt deeply as many can never again visit the beach the way they can now, and taking a walk through the dunes would be history.¬†most of our waddeneilanden¬†would be gone as well and waddenlopen (walking from behind the seadykes during low tide to our offshore wadden-island over the¬†sandbanks that fall dry during lowtide)¬†will no longer be possible. An economic loss would be felt too, as the higher sealevels would push salt water in the ground... even with dykes... it would mean that a lot of our agricultural land would become less fertile at at the very least to wet to use for the current crops, the flower-festifals of the zaanstreek, much of the agriculture there, it would chance or disapear. Our greenhouse agriculre works without soil more and more so it would survice, were it not the hailstorms and more severe weather making that ever more difficult too, but perhaps with bulletproof¬† or reinforced glass? So while we would survice this, it would reduce our economy by 15-20%, and making us ever more dependant on food imports, in a world were food would become ever more a problem. On the plus side we would have a ton of fresh water, in a world where that would become quite scarse.. we would be like the new oil barons... dealing in fresh water, that could compensate for our losses. We could win the markerwaard back from the sea to increase agricultural yields, but that would come at a severe effect to many unique annimal and plant species, and for this reason we did not do this even when it was planned in the flevowerken that created the provice flevoland. Desperate times, but seeing how the dunes would be gone and many annimal and plant spieces with it, it would be a hard debate, screw nature over even more, or risking the people to starve.. So overall we would pretty much survive, we would have to give up little land, but our economy, culture and ecology would take¬†a pretty bloody nose -fourth the big one the melting of the LANDBASED ice on the south pole. (this would require a LARGE rise in global temperatures to be feasable, as in¬†10 degrees or more, much more than for the other effects) But if it happend, yep we would be screwed... were we lucked out in 1-3, this one would hit us actually harder than global average sea level rises... +11-13m It would mean we would have to quadruplle the average dyke hight... and that means the base would need to be insanely wide.. it would be like the dutch economy trying to pull off the apollo project single handingly.. to large even for our budget. Than again most of our cultural city's and most of our population and most of our economy is located near the coast. But building that dyke would also make the land even more soggy and silty, wrech even more havoc on groundwater saltyness, make the river-flow even harder.. and be a disaster waiting to happen in the light of terrorist attacks or megastorms that now will be very common. -it can not be know what stance the dutch will take, will we ruin our national dept and economy and call deux est on the water and build that MEGADYKE in the 20 years orso we have to do it, building in an alarming rate keeping up with the gradual 11m rise over that period? -or do we pull back and give up halve our nation, cutting the number of provinces back to 8¬†and sacrifice 90% of our cultural herritage, and 70% of our economy while repopulating 80% of our population AND building a new seadyke and pick a new capitol.. we would become quite a tiny nation and even more densely populated. (keep in mind iaround 2060 ¬†over halve our population will be of foreign origine and might not have the same desire to save our herritage at all cost) -or will we do what dutch always do, go both ways, and sacrifice about a third of our nation but still build part of the megadyke but shorter to save at least part of our cultural herritage, along with some repopulation and breaking down and rebuilding brick by brick the most important historical buildings. We will survive though even THAT disaster.. but we would most likely suffer such an economic and cultural blow, we would be basicly be back to where we were after ww2, in ruins. than again.. in a world all suffering these effects and in need of rebuilding.. it helps to be the master of battling water in the world... perhaps we could earn back our wealth that way. we might become a second world country.. and reduced in size and lost a lot.. but we will hang on.",UCURjJbYLXNlTFDhy_RqYO0w,1,Ugiz0ocEVFhBUngCoAEC,VbiRNT_gWUQ,2015-02-18 16:20:04

Canada was a significant participator in last World Wars fighting against the Germans from Vimy Ridge towards the Liberation of Holland, but that's the past so why should you Americans care? Canada was involved in a crisis operation in Haiti in 2008, but why would America care about other nations helping others. Canadian health ministry was the first to develop a vaccine for the H1N1 outbreak. Canada co-founded and developed the IMAX screen in theaters, Canada's governor general (I think), shot the terrorist that had breached and entered parliament hill in 2014 that Trudeau will happily bring in more again later on. Canadian Armed Forces were the first to develop the CADPAT digital camouflage pattern which America indoctrinated into it's Armed Forces. Canada was the first to develop a super sonic jet fighter in the 60's known as the avro arrow, but later scrapped due to budgeting problems and slight suspicions the US told us to scrap em, oh the list goes on. So Canada has done significant things, it's just no one ever gave a shit. And Canada is a bilingual country, it can speak more than just one language whatever it likes due to it's French and British history. America has their own conflicting civil war history. Should Canada deserve some recognition, I say so. Tell you what, if Canada allows it's citizens to have their own weapons and less gun laws governing fire arms, volunteered in more wars that only create more lives lost and families devastated, and became a significant contributor on inventing and manufacturing weapons and nuclear arms capable of killing millions of civilian lives, would you say Canada is significant?",UCNaO6vHPBZ1MFnlzMLDgDbg,1,Ugwtov8ECbKQVnA3iy54AaABAg,VbiRNT_gWUQ,2015-02-18 16:20:04
