Water cloud is by far more critical for this process. CO2 plays direct role, and we know this direct contribution when doubling. However it is more critical how the whole system responds, mainly driven by HO2. As the new factor due to human activities is CO2 emissions, the rest as called as feedback. It is impossible to calculate this feedback theoretically, unless you enter empirical observation, which differs per area or temperature range in a chaotic way. We are not out of range in terms of absolute values. However we are out of range in terms of how quickly CO2 is added in atmosphere. Biosphere needs to adapt fast, and this is the problem. However this is not the only problem about human activities. Humans we need more and more resources from biosphere. This has a tremendous effect especially in oceans. Fossil fuels helped us increase our population minimizing resources from biosphere. Overall, fossil fuel, considering stable population, help humanity to live in parallel with wild.

I don&#39;t know if we will do enough to stay below 1.5°C but it&#39;s likely we will do enough to stay below 2°C and certainly enough to stay below 2.5°C. I know 2.5°C is absolutely horrible and I hope we do more to prevent that but I am absolutely certain we will do enough to prevent going above 2.5°C. More and more people are becoming aware of the climate crisis faster and faster, because the more people there are aware the faster the awareness will spread. Environmentalism is almost doubling every year and we only need to have 3.5% of the population doing civil disobedience protests to force governments to tackle the climate crisis effectively. If Extinction Rebellion continues to rise at the current rate (About 0.2% of the population are part of them), they will reach 3.5% in the next 5 years which is just about barely enough to stay below 1.5°C. The temperature I think we are most likely to stay below is 1.7°C or 1.8°C, which is not as good as 1.5°C but good enough that our planet will still be livable - it&#39;s still much better than 2.5°C",UCV4aBBMIKSuMHl_KY-rluiA,0,UgwvxClkUS_Yq7vsosR4AaABAg,ZfFvLJyPf3o,2020-05-19 14:30:02

Variety is nice - but according tonGates the world will end in 50 to 100 years if we do not reduce green house gases.<br /><br />2: Budget airlines for the last 30 years.Low paid working class people are flying 3 to 5 times a year - and the wealthy are flying 5 to 10 times a year. Business travellers 10 plus times a year for many non essential trips for an expenses paid jolly - for a meeting that could have been held online. <br /><br />3: Powerful 4 litre - 4 wheel drive cars are now the norm. If global warming was real then these cars would be banned full stop / ‘period’ as the Americans say. The green taxes applied do not even prevent a low paid worker having a big flash jeep.Small electric cars would have been subsidised so much we would all have had them. <br /><br />4: Instead the Governments around the world had solar panels subsidies and substantial cash back reward schemes for electricity generated. The rewards were good that the rich filled their farm land with thousands of solar panels and drained the so called green subsidy kitty dry within 2 years - so the schemes were scrapped before the average home owner could install 8 panels on his roof and use some green solar electricity. For 8 panels / 4 kWatts you would get £2000 cash back every year. So a rich person who had 1000 thousand panels installed on land was receiving £2 million for a 25 year scheme.<br /><br />It was free money for the rich. There should have been a limit on the amount of panels someone could install based on their electricity usage. They are not even using the green solar electrify being generated every day. It is a lie that it is fed back in to the national grid. What a scam!! <br /><br />So it is clear that Bill Gates and his UN gang do not believe that global warming is a serious threat within 50 years or they would have changed the above and done even more to influence our individual lifestyle, purchases and carbon emissions.",UC-eWU0HbsP-AujenQiRHRdw,0,UgyGMYv6iT0-G9jqBP94AaABAg,ZfFvLJyPf3o,2020-05-19 14:30:02

Permanent hurricanes will form around the tropics. Carbon from the long gone rainforests will accumulate on the ocean and atmosphere, together with unimaginable amounts of methane from melted permafrost and ocean clathrates. Close to the polar regions the lack of sunlight during winter will prevent plant life, as no known species are adapted to live in a warm climate with such long periods of low light. Most probably all boreal forests will be consumed by invasive insect species. The planet will rot and oceans will turn dark brown because of the billion tons of sargassum fed by the dust from the new deserts, as well as from the minerals washed out from the naked soils.<br />Beyond a tipping point temperatures would rise even further, in a positive feedback that could turn our planet 100% uninhabitable.

More water will reach the central parts of northern africa and australia! The size of the sahara desert will shrink due to an increase in vegetation at the cost areas.<br />2.

Of course, you could truck a few feet of Nebraska north (good luck with that).<br /><br /><br />Take a look at pictures of ice-free areas of Antarctica. Rock and rocks, with some gravel. Warm it up and how many farmers will clamor for the field? Lots, but only after hundreds or thousands of years as nature builds up some soil.<br /><br />Siberia? Maybe. Bogs and mosquitos and Putin&#39;s legacy, which surely won&#39;t be fun. But there will be excitement, what with the random explosions as permafrost melts and microbes make methane, building a pressure bubble underground until things go BOOM. Of course, unstable land that&#39;s shifting as its underlying permafrost melts over decades to centuries is a bugger to build on. Alaskan roads, buildings, pipelines, and even trees are destabilizing. Look up &quot;Drunken forest&quot;",UCh_glujen8ADGvFmSdnjR3w,0,UgxqOTplZjWfB-uoga14AaABAg,ZfFvLJyPf3o,2020-05-19 14:30:02

What this also means is that where rain is more likely to fall it will absolutely 'bucket down'! causing massive flooding, coastal erosion and landslides. And then there IS that problem of Hurricanes, globally the likely hood of them has already increased as has their severity @ only 1 degree at present, I suspect that if we get to 4 degree warming we might see them forming not only at the Equatorial line but possibly at the Tropics of Capricorn and Cancer as well.

Does oil and coal pollute you bet. It is way too expensive, we need a technology that gives us a Car that costs one dollar to go 500 miles, and is 5 minutes to charge back up. Problem One is that batteries will never do it. We need super capacitors. It can only happen with room temperature super conduction, Graphene doped with silver and boron. Then you need nuclear LFTRs to provide the 70% increase demand load on the grid. More than enough Thorium to last 5000 years until you perfect fusion, which the Ocean has a 1000000 year supply but look to the comets for more. Science people did you know that the CO2 levels were 10000 parts per million and the Earth was a big Ice Ball frozen at the Equator! What do you think the Limestone and marble is made out off? 4000 years ago how many grass eaters just in North America were putting out methane? Try 4.5billion, one herd of buffalo covered an entire state alone not to mention the deer, wild Rams etc. Number one polluter in the world is big agro. 50% of diesel goes into growing are food. Not to mention the energy that it takes to transport and refrigerate. We need 100 times more power clean and safe at 1/30 the cost. Yup we are almost there but the Elites of the world do not want that. 80% of the taxes paid all over the world are energy related. Governments make more money on oil than the oil companies do, and have no liabilities, that the oil companies do. Cheap clean energy is freedom. 23% of the cost of any product is energy, more or less. Solar and wind are energy transfers. Never get the power back that went into making them for solar unless used in space. I want that energy transfer on a boat, RV in the middle of no where, but will never generate the energy it cost to create(the glass,aluminum,silicon, silver, and then the wind Turbine with getting the rare Earths for the generator noise and bird kills) Energy is the real money! Science people not junk science, would love to have a debate with the fact that nuclear power has a million times more energy than a chemical bond. It is 24/7 cheap clean , not the water based reactors of today a LFTR look it up. Not enough rare Earths to create enough batteries to do 1/10th of what you are saying and would increase the cost of power by 200%. Nice for the governments to tax and make more money, no we need 100 times the power at 1/30th the cost. Solar can never be more than 50% efficient and again never make back the watts that go into making them, same with wind, also these systems have to be replaced every 25 years the pollution then trying to recycle them is catastrophic for the environment..",UChjKqDfktMPRd8UHfv-E3Ow,0,UgynRqaDl3EOKwsX9yt4AaABAg,ZfFvLJyPf3o,2020-05-19 14:30:02

Kurt Dobson,"For thinking people; ah, the great debate on climate change. <br /><br />One way to test whether this is an honest exchange of facts and ideas is to to seed these sites with facts and ideas that either support the narrative, or contest it. I have done this over the last week on at least forty of the major taking one side or the other. <br /><br />What I found is that usually within 48 hours, anything I say that doesn&#39;t support global warming as a crisis is removed, or edited down to only language that is supportive, while anything post that would support the argument stays. Makes one wonder where the money is coming from...<br /><br />From NASA:  Based on orbital variations, Milankovitch predicted that the ice age would peak every 100,000 and 41,000 years, with additional “blips” every 19,000 to 23,000 years. Three variables of the Earth&#39;s orbit—eccentricity, obliquity, and —affect global climate. But it&#39;s a lot more complicated than that. <br /><br />And, the last ice age was about 30,000 years ago. Interestingly humans didn&#39;t do so well because it&#39;s hard to migrate and one can show that there were less than 30,000 humans that survived through mitochondrial DNA analysis. Whales, insects and such do much better and have been doing so for 100&#39;s of millions of years.<br /><br />So, I totally believe in climate change... It&#39;s been going on for 100&#39;s of millions of years, since planet formation.  Long before humans arrived; and yep, the ice caps melt, ocean levels change and humanity gets huge disruptions, then everything freezes up and people must move south to survive.<br /><br /><br /><br />And, finally any huge heroic effort by humanity to change things one way or another would take another 100k years (one cycle) to measure the effect. <br /><br />I&#39;ll wait a few days and see which if any of my comments survive whoever has time and access to edit or eliminate my input.<br /><br />It&#39;s pretty easy to get the impression that the narrative is being used as a political tool to try and get vast groups of people behind yet another &#39;crisis&#39;, then steer them to support a politician who puts himself up as a though-leader on the subject. The game is to capture votes.",UChiv0vaRdmkIXijxkj47TKQ,0,UgwISvHI00yB9-NibLV4AaABAg,ZfFvLJyPf3o,2020-05-19 14:30:02

At the moment we are reaching a more normal tempreture since there were a ”small ice age” between like 1300s and mid 1800s. <br />The reason why we keep beating ”records” every year is that the readings started late 1800s... and if you want to share propaganda for something you will win in... it’s very easy to just leave the info about the time before that out... well it would probably not hurt the earth to be more ”green” but we are still far from any catastrophy if we look longer than just 100-150 years back in time. <br /><br />We need a lot more sience around this subject before saying ”official” things about it... <br />often it’s said that almost all scientists are united in this... well... yes most % of what the UN choose of ”serious” science says so... however they only choose a very few % of all science they got... who says what’s serious science and not... hmm... who has the intrest and what is the intrest.. oh well... now i see... treat all science equal until other science says the opposite and later that perhaps gets proven wrong so we get back. <br />Science is only the truth until someone desides it’s not,UCBAV1Gr4_zfe8Yj3EmdqgBw,0,Ugz6sRNqUXgSIBsEJRV4AaABAg,ZfFvLJyPf3o,2020-05-19 14:30:02

Where will these hundreds of millions live? I guess huge areas of the remaining forests would have to be chopped down in order to create the necessary space for mega cities?? And while most of the planet&#39;s surface are deserts, where - as we all know, nothing really grows - where will the Earth&#39;s oxygen be produced so that these allegedly still hundreds of millions of people in number are able to BREATHE? Or will breathing have become out of fashion? Truth rather is: in a world scenario like this the planet&#39;s population will have been wiped out almost completely, because of natural disasters such as fires and floods, wars over water, resources, land and food and global pandemics. One may assume that in the process of a rapidly increasing global temp, due to the release of mega-tons of methane from the nordic permafrosts, civilization will collapse entirely, mega famines will decimate the human race and wars and general chaos will make the remaining survivors wish they were also dead.

I haven&#39;t watched the rest yet but it sounds like he&#39;s on the verge of hysterically laughing as he talks about rivers drying up and everything turning into a desert.<br /><br />Edit: Also, we could&#39;ve used a key to explain what we were looking at on that map. What is the brownish gray areas compared to the yellow which is sand? I thought it may be mountainous areas considering it went over the Himalayas but it&#39;s also over areas that are covered in forests right now, and wouldn&#39;t some of those mountains start having forests grown on them or become more suitable for agriculture higher up where the reason stuff can&#39;t grow right now is because of the cold? Too many questions for you to have never explained what the different colors of that map mean. It&#39;s just yellow=bad and green=good? It&#39;s not that simple. Plus, if there really are so few agriculturally stable areas left, is that map showing &quot;habitability&quot; or the potential to grow crops in those areas? Because if the green just means they could grow crops there then with better methods of supply it&#39;s still completely possible for people to live in the yellow areas, if only the yellow areas closest to the green and areas on coastal lands or near rivers that could get easy access to trade. I&#39;m just too confused by your confident conclusions in this video of how people will have to migrate, entire populations getting up and leaving rather than the possibility that flooding would be prevented the same way Louisiana avoids flooding despite all of New Orleans being below sea level. If your title was how it &quot;Could Change&quot; rather than how it &quot;Will Change&quot; I would&#39;ve given you some more leeway here. But not only aren&#39;t you describing geography in too much of this as you discuss human responses and movements, you&#39;ve made broad claims about rivers drying up and forests being destroyed without backing that up with anything. Will a 4 degree difference cause all those trees to die, or is it the lack of water from drying rivers which causes them to dry? Either way, Brazil has one of the biggest stores of water resources in the world, like Canada and Russia which are still in the green on your map. Brazil would have to deal with much hotter temperatures but I&#39;m not sure what the reason the entire Amazon would be destroyed is in your explanation. Are you saying the forests will die, then at what average temperature will they? It&#39;s weird to me that you think this would happen. <br /><br />It seems more likely that trees and vegetation that are more heat resistant will wind up surviving and dropping more seeds that grow trees like them, while other trees that couldn&#39;t handle the Gradual rise in temperatures would not reproduce as much and would die out. As any mean rise in global temperatures would be Gradual, vegetation would have some time for natural selection as it always has in the past. Forests don&#39;t just die from temperature changes. Humans have cut them down for space for farming and in the Amazon that continues to be a problem, but if the Amazon is destroyed it&#39;s not going to be from temperature change like you suggested. I don&#39;t understand where the reasoning behind it comes from, and if Brazil manages to get a leader in charge who cares more about protecting the forests than expanding agricultural businesses and logging, I can see Brazil saving the rainforest. If, and only if it is saved from being cut down much more, then Brazil&#39;s expansive water reserves should keep it alive. Cool temperatures under tree canopies in the shade should keep younger trees alive more too, making the rise in temperatures even more gradual, potentially. There are a lot of factors that go in to how vegetation survives and thrives other than just the temperature it&#39;s in. After all, forests grow in all parts of the world. Though with different trees and vegetation, that vegetation has mainly sprouted in those areas naturally and has changed on its own without our involvement for millions of years. When the temperature goes up, yes some species of plants will die, but the whole world isn&#39;t going to become a desert because of a 4 degree increase in temperature. The much more likely result will be shifts in the kinds of vegetation that thrive in different areas. Maybe forests will be lower to the ground, not grow as tall, or they will have half as many leaves and be thinner to need less water- Whatever happens, at this moment there are hundreds of ways that the world could go. And this video doesn&#39;t make me think that the future you&#39;re describing is the actual future of the Earth&#39;s geography. Not when you say some things with certainty that we really don&#39;t know. Not when you describe human migrations as if modern technology, global trade, and the information age as a whole won&#39;t alter those kinds of migrations and the need for them at all. If you were going to say such confident stuff about the desertification of forests you shouldn&#39;t have mentioned anything about the necessity for humanity to move into &quot;habitable&quot; zones like people don&#39;t already live in deserts. I&#39;m only three and a half minutes into the video but it&#39;s a shame the way this one&#39;s turning out compared to many of the other geography videos on your channel. I get that the other videos are easier to make factual because it&#39;s current geography and how it has been utilized by humans in the past, but when talking about the future in an educational video there should be both explanations and mention of your own room for error as it is not possible to Know what really will happen. You are making inferences that you treat as certainties.

Trees for holding the structural integrity of the soil so you don't flood with mud, and since you can use the shade they provide to grow other crops which otherwise would not grow there due to too much sunlight or too high temperatures. Add to that tethered hot air baloons which to hold shades above the ground, especially useful for shading cities, and you have a recipe for success. And this is not even taking into account the usage of active-support space-towers to move a lot of the heat from the ground to outside the atmosphere, effectively getting a county-sized to planet-sized air conditioning unit (depending on the specifications). And if you export heat to space anyway, you could also move some of that heat into the arctic circle to permanently melt the ice while cooling other parts of the world, and use the active-support space-towers to import electricity and to hold mirrors to light the arctic circle, to effectively turn the whole land mass of the planet green.",UCr0EpmjzKO-Bi9GxzuPNwVQ,1,UgwWuevQTRWXTG2swHF4AaABAg,ZfFvLJyPf3o,2020-05-19 14:30:02

Perhaps the sudden rise will disrupt, but I think you need at least 4c temp rise to start such disbalance. And I do reckon the reality of us having to check on carbon emissions is sinking in. Besides the role of the Amazon and all rainforests in oxygen and carbon cycles is way over rated. The oceans' algae plankton are the dominant source of global oxygen. Oceans contain about 60 times the CO2 amount of the 1880 's atmosphere, or 16 times the total terrestrial biosphere, including soils. Most of that carbon is out of reach in lower layers of the oceans, yet those upper layers are dominant. Oceans also have taken up about 90% of the heat and +40% of carbon emissions so far.

I'll just give you one simple example: if the Amazon rain forest was desert, the earth's oxygen level would be cut in half, meaning mass extinctions. It's become beyond comprehension just how misinformed citizens are. The current rate of change on earth is 10kX faster than all past extinction events. What's that mean? I don't have those answer's, but its the equivalent of walking across a thousand Mile desert with no food or water, it's not if you will die, but when you'll die. I'm 100% confident, not many people understand the current peer reviewed science that clearly shows we have no chance of changing direction and our time is now measured in decades, not centuries. I'll close with one more mistake in this outrageous video, when the earth's average temp exceeds 3 to 4 deg C, the feedback loops will move us into the 10 to 12deg C neighborhood.

Same with northern Siberia and most of northern Canada. There is another problem......... understatement........ as you move to higher latitudes, the intensity of the sunlight diminishes over a given area and the seasons shift. Pollinators will have to adjust, and most won&#39;t make it. So, garden vegetables will have to be grown in greenhouses to exclude pests and people will have to hand pollinate, which produces less robust and healthy plants, fruits and seeds. No more &quot;amber waves of grain&quot;, either.<br />As the rivers dry up in the south, the nuclear plants and the numerous spent fuel cooling ponds will not have sufficient water, or power, to pump over the fuel bundles to keep them from going Fukushima. Thousands of tons of nuclear material will be released as gas, smoke, and chunks as the pools dry out and experience &quot;prompt nuclear events&quot;....... like unit 3 at Fukushima Daiichi. Then, there will be a LOT of warfare and some of it will eventually be nuclear. Pakistan vs. India. India vs China. US vs Russia. The EMPs will finish off the grid in most places. No power at the plug, no internet, no phones, no petroleum being pumped OR refined, no water at the taps, no fuel or radar for planes, no nat. gas pumped or processed, no diesel for trucks or trains....so no food brought to stores, no harvesting machinery operating, no controlling dams&#39; spillways, and the list goes on and on. Sea level rise will take out almost all seaports, so no moving food or material by sea, even IF fuel was available. <br />There is nothing to stop the GAST increase once it gets a good head of steam... it will blow right past 4C. increase and sail past 6C. and may not stop until 12 or 13C., if it stops at all.

Who's gonna pay? and then you still have to hope or install fans to blow it where you want it. In cities like Bagdad they do have houses you know but if it's 50C outside it warms up very fast, not everyone can afford aircon or has the money to run them. There's no easy solution, water is a problem so growing trees in parched infertile soils is not gonna happen. I would suggest they invest in desalination plants run on solar/wind energy also in AU. we have lots of coastline and a lot of vacant sun scorched land, vast solar panel farms would even help to lower the soil temp and if they were raised and watered by the desal plants might even be productive, but at scale it takes a LOT of money.

Honestly, Russia right now could use Fresnal Mirror Walls to be able to have a port with direct access to the oceans on their eastern coast. The downside is that it would still have to be outside of the arctic circle, to work the whole year, but the advantage is that with floating structures, they would get a channel/canal. Just reflect a bit part of the sunlight onto a thin strip thick enough for ships to pass through, and maybe even have some floating docks somewhere in the open seas, like the oil platforms, and you've got a more threatening Russia. And if you're at it, why not use similar fresnel mirror walls to green most of Russia in the process.

For example, partially shading the land to reduce temperatures and to reduce water evaporation, getting water vapors from the sea to inland in sunlight and then releasing them into the shaded areas to condense into mist and dew and maybe even rain, and making the shades reflective and focusing them onto power-generating towers (like they currently do with solar collector-concentrators, but with the reflective shading material), bioengineering and/or selectively breeding plants to do well in higher temperatures, using solar chimneys to cause local cooling and to condense the mist into liquid water with by running it through a large-enough radiator, and a whole lot more.

I am not a climate scientist but I have apparently taken more time to educate myself on the topic than you did to make this video. Climate change patterns are more complicated that just being based on lattitude as you seem to think in this video. The earth is not warming uniformly. For example right now the arctic is warming much faster than the rest of the planet. Also, climate is influenced in no small part by ocean currents which will be disrupted by climate change, and things like changes in ocean temperatures and salinity. Another things this video ignores is the devastating effect climate change will have on ecosystems even in the milder parts of the planet, ecosystems that we are a part of. Another way climate change may already be effecting us is that many scientists believe that disease epidemics like the current one will become more common as the earth warms.

Climate Change is has and will always be caused by the changes in the tilt of the earths axis north star and proximity to the SUN. The source of all energy in our solar system. Global warming is happening because as the Earth's axis continues to tilt towards the sun. More DIRECT sunlight reaches the higher latitudes poles. Warming the southern hemisphere heat sink oceans and thawing the northern hemisphere frozen co2 continents. Which is why temperature rises first and co2 follows. Cause and effect. The inconvenient truth about the MILANKOVITCH cycles causing ClimateChange is that every 13 k years when the Precession of the north star aligns the equator with the solar orbital plane the gravitational pull of the SUN pulls tsunami's around the planet East to west because the planet spins west to east. The climate cycles of our water planet are continental glaciers with lower sea levels brought on by Global tsunami's every 13 k years. The one off about the slow rise of sea levels as the continental glaciers thaw is the Zanclean flood of the Mediterranean. Earth is a closed loop that self regulates co2 with LIFE.

Why should we forget the past, when it is one of the best sources to learn from our mistakes and become a better world?<br /><br /><br />The Homo Sapien species has been around for 200, 000 (two hundred thousand years) years, but humans didn’t become civilised until 130,000 years ago. Over these years humans created extinctions, and disasters that affected the world and the creatures that lived in the Earth, but mostly, humans affected themselves. We cannot cover up every war, every destroyer of  civilisation, every disturbance in the entire history. Events such as global warming, animal extinction, global wars, destruction of trees, interruptions of peaceful and innocent races, famines and every other dark event were all created by humans, and some events, not included in the list, are even denied existence. Instead of trying to cover these errors, we should try and learn from them, and never repeat them.<br /><br /><br />Our past experiences are composed of 2 key things: success, and failure. Either way, we can learn from them and correct ourselves to become better people. For success, we think why it was successful, and how it was successful. If we succeed in winning an award, we would think back how we achieved this prize and the road we took to achieve it. For failure, we think why it was unsuccessful and we’ll try to prevent it from happening. If suddenly your economy collapsed, you would think what did you do incorrectly that led you to failure. The past is a way to learn, and whether the events were successful or unsuccessful, we can still pursue our journey to a better life.<br /><br /><br />Your experiences are precious, but what about others? Everyone has and will experience the world differently, and their experiences are just as valuable as your own experiences. Picture an elder, who walked the earth for a hundred years, who tells you their knowledge and view of the world. Imagine how much more knowledge you can share with your friends now! Or you can even use this knowledge and branch it off even further. But no matter what you do with this information, you would have learnt something you would have never known and become more aware of the world.<br /><br /><br />Learning from others is a great source of information, but what about our parents? Your parents may have put a few rules around the house or even warnings, such as “don’t watch TV too long!” Although it is annoying, there could be entire stories that created these rules. Your parents could have experienced failure in the past, and some of them can never be changed. Like any parent, they would want the next generation to avoid the mistakes they made, which if followed could become the golden child of perfection. <br /><br /><br />The past is full of secrets and wonders and the experiences they give are valuable and meaningful. Society’s quote of forgetting the past is incorrect and gives a wrong idea to the world and its happenings. Whether it&#39;s from history, your family’s, or yours, it will give you wisdom about the world and how we live.",UCd54QjuLUvwRHMpR5V4wX1g,0,UgzCSyEJZWe1ni-yDgV4AaABAg,ZfFvLJyPf3o,2020-05-19 14:30:02

Personally I doubt that 3/4ths of the Earth would become desert because, as the Earth warms up, the atmosphere can hold more suspended moisture.

As a result regional jungles and forrests would pop up in places not seen before like you mentioned in the video.

I mean, if I remember correctly, arabs import most of their food. So if something happened which made them unable to import that food (like war, for example, or economic sanctions, or a trade ban caused by a second more dangerous coronaplague wave, or even just natural disasters causing the exporting countries to not have enough food to export), then they would be screwed. Plus that turning the desert areas into farmland would severely increase the living conditions of the people there and the GDP of every nation in the world (thanks to trade). At the very least, it would allow the people who already own land and have infrastructure in areas which recently turned into desert, to claim back farmland from the desert and increase the land value of the land they own. And depending on how much they are willing to pay and the conditions in the area at that time, it would be significantly cheaper than moving somewhere else by selling their land before making it productive again.

Even renewable energy has its drawbacks- especially battery and solar power because both solar panels and many rechargable batteries require rare earth metals and other very hard-to-find materials. Rare earth metals in specific have to be extracted in tiny amounts from a massive quantity of rock via strip mining, which fucks up the land, and also creates toxic sludge as a byproduct of extracting the metals from the rock. You have to process MIND BOGGLING amounts of rock to get just a MINUSCULE amount of these metals, and on top of that, over 90% of the Earth's entire reserve of them is in China, and China has ENTIRE LAKES filled with said sludge. Nuclear power (Fission at least) is very bad because the power plants can belch up huge clouds of highly radioactive, toxic and carcinogenic gasses that spread across the entire planet, and radiation leaks from this can render large amounts of land uninhabitable for more than TWENTY THOUSAND YEARS. Not only that, but fission produces spent fuel that stays radioactive for hundreds of THOUSANDS of years, and you have to store it in such a secure way that we really CAN'T completely eliminate the risk of the waste being discovered or freed from its storage by a natural disaster.

Earth has been several times hotter, take Mesozoic era for example. During the Late Cretaceous it was around 27-37 degrees Celsius. That’s way hotter than today. But guess what, there were a lot of forest areas around the world. Heck even places that no longer have them today. So what’s more likely is rising sea levels, stronger storms, and of course melting of ice. So yeah the Amazon might be gone by then, in fact, there’s evidence to support that, since it’s getting drier. We can’t forget about diseases as well. Tropics diseases now can expand their range thx to this warming climate. So yes, soon we can see the Yellow Fever happening in places like Russia. Also the glaciers are important, because they contain some unknown virus. And not to mention wildfires, they will be more common. Just imagine the Australian fire, but at a much bigger scale.

Weather patterns will definitely change but the overall effect would be more tropical zones. If you dont believe me, take a look back in history. In the Mesozoic era, Global temps and CO2 levels were higher than today, the resulting climate included tropical rainforests across most of the equator and even at mid latitudes, where drier conditions did exist, they were savannas and not full deserts<br /><br />2) There will be no mass relocation/migrant crisis because of climate change<br />-The very definition of &quot;climate&quot; is the overall weather conditions over a long of time. In the odd chance climate change does make conditions worse, it will not all happen in 1 year, rather, it will be spread out over time (maybe 20, 50 or 1000 years). Humans do not adapt to change in one generation but they certainly do over many generations as seen with culture, language, population centers. Given it may take many generations to feel the effects, Humans will naturally move, relocate, whatever t suit their needs. It will be done naturally as individuals decide to buy a new home and companies relocate factories. Ask yourself this question: 100 years ago, did the population centers look the same as they are today? No, look at the most populated areas and you&#39;ll see how humans have slowly moved for whatever reason (economic, climate, productivity) There was no sudden movement every time there was a drought or flood so why should we expect the same later?<br /><br />3) Humans don&#39;t need perfect conditions to live (at least in the 21st century)<br />-10,000 years ago, if a river dried up, the people around it died. In 2020 however if a river dries up, the people do not simply die, rather they build pipelines, wells, etc to bring the water to them. Imperial valley in California is technically a desert yet it has one of the most fertile farmland in all of California, why is that? They have a canal that supplies all the water they need. Look at Phoenix, temps are sometimes 100F yet its population grows everyday. A/C has eliminated our dependence on good weather and humans will live wherever they can. A change in outside climate will not adversely affect the living conditions of the average home. To add onto this, relocation costs would be too much and cities will find a way to live with what they have. They may build desalination plants, install check valves, use renewables, etc, but they will certainly not move like our ancestors did in the past. We are smarter than that",UC7kiIVD-hfeg8ZJ5hnqcKYg,0,UgylbuGRgE3e7e8-jXl4AaABAg,ZfFvLJyPf3o,2020-05-19 14:30:02

If the shades were also reflective, that heat would radiate away into space, or it could be focused on a wall and used for solar power, and the excess heat pumped into radiator-towers to have air currents take the excess heat away.

Why would there be so much desert?<br />+ The fact that there is more heat energy in the air, would likely change the planetary wind system, which could bless many spots with favourable climate, just like the British Isles today. Again, why so many deserts?<br />+ The closer you get to the poles the less solar energy you get, which reduces traditional and greenhouse farming to only the few months around summer. Crop production would not be able to keep up with global demand without vertical farming and farming in the sunnier regions.<br />+ Siberia/Central Asia is far far away from the sea latitudewise. That kind of continental weather is usually very dry, hardly appropriate for farming.<br /><br />Way before our history Earth already had several phases of very hot world climates, hotter than just 4°C from now.

The earth also slowly regains its ability to become greener due to the rise in the much needed gas of life which co2 is. Nature organises itself to keep the system going, so while the atmospheric co2 levels needed to sustain all life on earth were continuously dropping throughout history threatening plant life worldwide nature created a new animal homo sapiens who was smart enough to excavate the captured co2 from millions of years of fotosynthese which was building up in the groundlayers in the form of oil , natural gas and coal. By using these fossil fuels as energy source they release the building blocks of life in the form of co2 molecules. 200 years ago the atmospheric co2 levels reached a dangerously low point when they were at 300 ppm, now we ar slowly repleting the depleted volumes and are now at around 400 ppm, far away still from the 10 times higher volumes that were present when the earth was on its greenest with the highest biodiversity ever seen but it's a start. Unfortunately enough some species of homo sapiens have found a way to scandalously enrich themselves by labeling co2 as a pollutant creating a new but very ecological destructive industrial branch namely ""green"" energy. In reality this green energy is just the opposite using up all earth's rare resources and destructing the environment by doing so in a rate never seen before.",UCawqY4mmpvpl8K48Cha1SoA,1,UgwjRb3Tu9FrsAZjOYN4AaABAg,ZfFvLJyPf3o,2020-05-19 14:30:02

I’m sure there’ll be more intense weather events and more intense droughts but the whole world becoming a desert? Probably not. Greenland, Scandinavia, Siberia, Canada, Alaska becoming arable? Definitely not. Siberia and the Canadian Shield are currently cold, dry wastelands. Just because the cold goes away doesn’t take away from the fact that they’d still be dry wastelands. This is the only RLL video I have ever disliked because of how far-fetched and inaccurate it is. I’m not an expert but there are so many flaws with the basis of this video. It doesn’t seem like much research was done either.

No Khanna did not make this map, and even if he did, he&#39;s not a climate scientist and not qualified to do so anyway. He says he got the map from a 2009 article in New Scientist. That article is blocked part way through by pay wall, but it looks like it was created by an environmental journalist. Without reading the article, I don&#39;t know the full context for the map, but the way this video presents it is very misleading. Anyone who studies climate knows it is extremely complex, and you can&#39;t just paint the whole map as desert. If the earth warmed by 4° C by 2100, we won&#39;t just turn into a desert instantly, there will be a sizeable lag and massive swings in climate over each region of Earth. It would be better presented as a reality far into the future, if we warm that much by 2100 and remain at the temperature or higher. On top of that, I have serious doubts that 2/3 of the world will become a desert, and it&#39;s extremely difficult to predict this. Instead of labeling places as a desert, instead low, medium, and high risk for unsuitable climate would be more appropriate. This video is infuriating that it presents something so serious without using a credible source and misleading folks.

Modern desertification is primarily caused by deforestation and overgrazing (plant cover retains water, which then evaporates from the plant rather than flowing away as runoff), and while these things aren&#39;t fully independent from climate change, they are not an inevitable consequence of 4C of temperature rise in many areas.",UCtIcl-JjJBK8cpW6VQ_PhcA,0,UgyAjnzzrKvfDOSp70t4AaABAg,ZfFvLJyPf3o,2020-05-19 14:30:02

It will take hundreds if not thousands of years for it to grow crops. As well Russia, Alaska and Canada are not much better.When the permafrost melts you get muskeg. Water logged land with nutrient poor soil. Decades will be needed to make the soil able to yield good crops. On top of that the 4°C rise does nothing to make the growing year as long as further south. You still have the same number of hours of daylight as now. On top of that, in the winter, so instead of -50C you get -46C. Big deal. It is still damn cold, It will not turn onto the abundant mid-west overnight. <br /><br />As well, there is no need to relocate people. Cities of millions of people operate fine in deserts as long as transportation stays available. Over a million people live in Las Vegas and a similar number in Phoenix. a 4C temperature rise is still within what people can live in comfortably. <br />With solar and wind energy water can be brought in and once you have water and energy you can do anything. It would be easier to but a cover over much of the cities and leave people where they are. Like Fremont street in Las Vegas. <br /><br />As well such spread of deserts will be a slow process.

These area are and would be uninhabitable for more than just &quot;It real cold&quot;. Siberia especially eastern Siberia has some of the lowest rainfall records in the world resulting in Siberia being less like the great plains or the Russian steppe, and more like the Canadian Shield is today, a dry, desolate wasteland that just so happens to be temperate, due mainly to the prevailing westerlies pushing all the Pacific moisture East towards Alaska and not over Siberia. On the other hand most of North America would fair much better than today. Why? Thank the ice age. When the glaciers came down they removed all the topsoil in that area leaving only bare rock, which is not good for developing civilization. It would take thousands of years of erosion by both plants and rainfall to pulverize the surface rock into usable soil. Greenland would suffer the same problem. Only the parts of Russia West of the Ural mountains and Scandinavia would truly fit this fertile land of a superpower idea.

The guy who wrote the book isn&#39;t a scientist/climatologist as far as I can tell (as others in the comments have already stated), so he really isn&#39;t a reliable source to begin with.<br />2. If the world warms up by 4 degrees, it won&#39;t &quot;just make everything a desert.&quot; Some areas will get less rainfall, but many other areas will get a lot more rainfall.<br />3. If the Earth warms by 4 degrees, climates will become more drastic and differentiated, not just all desert.<br />4. With a massive amount of cold water entering the oceans from melting ice caps, the ocean&#39;s currents will stop moving, which means many places, such as Canada and Northern Euopre, will actually get colder due to the lack of an ocean current bringing warm water and air south and taking cold water and air north.<br />5. This is definately the 100% worst case scenario, even if it could happen.<br /><br />If this video is based on the book, it isn&#39;t scientifically accurate, and even if it was, this would be a worst case scenario. This is based on the assumption that the Earth will warm 4 degrees, which is higher than the predicted average if we stay on track in terms of how fast we&#39;re transitioning to renewable energy. Some of the events in the video might happen to a small degree, but nothing near what is in the video. This is an interesting situation, but likely belongs in the realm of alternate history rather than &quot;this is definately going to happen.&quot;<br /><br />(By no means is this me saying this isn&#39;t an issue. This is an issue that we need to solve, and is probably the most important one long-term, but this video will scare people away from this topic and is probably doing more harm than good.

Read from a climatologist next time please!<br /><br />Not even sure where to begin with this map, so much is wrong. For starters, Antarctica has been ice for 40 million years. The earth has been 8 degrees C warmer than today, on average, at least 4 times in that period with no ice melt. Also, lets talk deserts. Heat has almost nothing to do with desert formation, it is ALL about the precipitation. During ice ages, when less heat is around, MORE and LARGER deserts exist on average. During hotter times the Earth gets very humid, creating rain forests and jungles not deserts. Still not ideal for human life but a far cry from a sandbox like this seems to assume. It makes a lot of sense, more water + more heat = more evaporation. There also seems to be a massive amount of ignorance of ocean currents involved in this map. Not to beat a dead horse but Spain, France, and morocco will all basically become a rainforest due to the insane amount of moisture hitting the region. Greenland will actually become green, so not sure why there is only a small strip of green on it. Finally, trade. What the hell?

I understand that people can believe that especially if they never feel the affects of it, but unfortunately there is countless scientific studies proving the prevalence of climate change and global warming. People like to argue that the 1-2 degrees Celsius increase in temperature from the 1800’s could be the cause of the technology giving people in the 21st century the ability to more accurately take temperature readings compared to the 1800’s, but then you can look at studies of the ozone layer diminishing at a significant rate from just the 1970’s where we’ve had the ability to spectrograph the atmosphere and take accurate readings of the O3 levels and see that they are reducing. You can even look towards the ocean levels which never really needed advanced equipment to gather data to see that they have risen at an exponential rate over the past 200 years. What do you think will happen these next 100 years if it continues on this exponential path? Entire cities, islands, even countries could be lost leaving people homeless and it’s your type of ignorance that leads to their lives being ruined. The only people that benefit off the belief that global warming isn’t real is billionaires that made their money through oil and fossil fuels and don’t want to waste the time to repurpose their stocks and finances into other long term business opportunities because they won’t be around much longer to deal with the repercussions.",UCn8U2OlXA5ycMH84rZjidlg,1,UgxCgDn4KIf16ocT6Xl4AaABAg,ZfFvLJyPf3o,2020-05-19 14:30:02

When the air gets to the equator it warms and go up in the atmosphere, at the same time the air in the poles become colder and goes down, this flow of air in the equator and in the poles is what makes the entire atmosphere flow. It works like a pump, pumping hot air to the higher and forcing it to go to the poles and cold air in low altitude to the equator. With the air water vapor is carried in clouds and that is why the equator is wetter, because both pumps find one another there and water, being heavier, becomes trapped, condenses and fall in the form of rain. It is a basic principle and it doesn't change, the Equator will always be the place on Earth with most precipitation, the only way to change it would be changing the angle of Earth's Rotation.",UCl-RzBn3AmsMUPw9NXLrkow,1,UgxpJCKDKUk6IjSGu6R4AaABAg,ZfFvLJyPf3o,2020-05-19 14:30:02

Desertification will only occur in some equatorial regions in the instance of complete deforestation, which in some places is actually somewhat likely, but only some. And others, even in the event of total(or nearly total) deforestation will see more of a savannah/grassland sort of biome take over. Deforestation absolutely causes decreased rainfall due to loss of evapotranspiration in those regions, but oftentimes that rainfall reduction is in other regions that count on those forested areas evaporation to feed their precipitation each year. Long story short, the climate is complicated, the factors are complicated, and the effects of direct man-made change to different regions are complicated. Different biomes could see transformation(or just plain expansion instead) in one of a few different types of biomes depending on all of the other factors that coincide with the increase in temperature. This is why we use climate models to map the different possible outcomes based off of different starting conditions.

Also note that significant anthropogenic deforestation efforts were already taking place over 4000y ago (along with the desertification/degradation of grasslands and the exploitation of many of the keystone creatures that stabilized these ecosystems), so while a comparison to 35 years ago may seem positive at first blush it misses an important portion of the trend. The larger picture is that we've stabilized at a far lower vegetative biomass than existed pre-civilization, that these temporary increases are only seen as plant populations drift poleward, and that this increase is nominal and shouldn't excuse more deforestation. Third, global reforesting efforts are woefully under-diverse, and are (generally) mono-crops developed by lumber industries to meet regulatory reforestation quotas and to feed future logging. These forests are pretty pitiful at fostering the ecological functions typical of endemic forests, far more susceptible to climatic and biological catastrophes, necessitate huge chemical and energy inputs for installation and maintenance and because of all this, they're (generally) not considered to confer any net economic, social or ecological benefit.",UC_mgGpZnzZ0n_8-q_Wyft-Q,1,UgxpJCKDKUk6IjSGu6R4AaABAg,ZfFvLJyPf3o,2020-05-19 14:30:02

It will mainly affect weather patterns to where what once was desert may very well become arable land because there&#39;s this thing called rainfall. And rainfall will ALWAYS happen somewhere. The reason we have deserts in some places isn&#39;t the inability for rain to fall there, it&#39;s because the way winds blow means these areas rarely get any moist air flowing over it and it&#39;s constantly locked into a high pressure zone.<br />If the jetstream shifts just ever so slightly, it&#39;s going to mean rain will fall on current deserts.<br /><br />2) Rising temperatures (in such small degrees) doesn&#39;t change the moisture level in the air for the worse. Dry climates exist exactly because most of the planet&#39;s water is locked into the oceans. With higher temperatures, more water will evaporate into the air. In other words, air will have a higher capacity to hold water the hotter it is and is the sole reason you get clouds. Warm and moist air rises into colder layers which condenses and falls back as raindrops.<br />A hotter climate means this happens more frequently across the globe. Again, what makes deserts deserts is the fact the winds that carry moist air around literally avoid the desert regions of the world.<br />Look at Norway, more specifically Bergen. They are pummeled year round by moist air from the atlantic ocean which is forced up against the mountains and so there&#39;s heavy precipitation on the western coast of Norway.<br /><br />3) The assumption that Greenland would still be mostly of arctic climate is laughable at best. In a scenario where average temperatures would rise by 4 degrees, all of Greenland would actually become green in short time. And so would most of the north pole.<br />Antarctica might still have some arctic climate though.<br /><br />4) &quot;Denmark would become a new superpower because they own greenland&quot;<br />That is even more laughable. They would lose their claim over Greenland in a heartbeat by other nations.<br />Simply focusing on Antarctica as a hotbed for conflict is quite weak. In a scenario where temperatures have risen by 4 degrees, such weak forces like the UN will cease to function completely.<br />Greenland will be invaded by whomever decides to start WW III first, which is inevitable in such a scenario.<br />5) If there&#39;s a demand, there&#39;s a supply. Ever heard of the movie Waterworld?<br />In short, people that have nowhere else to go will learn to live on the water. The Netherlands will build their cities Venice style. Floating on the water and their farms will be in large bags that also float on top of the water.<br /><br />6) You are of course also assuming mankind will even exists as it does today in 80 years from now. I am pretty sure we will have eradicated each other by then.",UCtekmeOTT4YFgR585seBQWg,0,UgwgDsgI7k1QbJNYjaV4AaABAg,ZfFvLJyPf3o,2020-05-19 14:30:02

Moreover, the higher levels of CO2 in the atmosphere will actually decrease the plants need for water (look it up).<br /><br />However, it is important to remember that the extra rain has the potential to fall in less pleasant patterns, with some regions drying up and others getting flooded.

Last year, there was a heat wave that devasted North-west Europe and broke a record for the hottest temperature ever recorded in the UK. Probably also in the Netherlands and Belgium judging by their proximity. As well as that, in January Antarctica broke a record for the hottest temperature ever recorded on the planet and in the same month Norway broke a record for the hottest temperature reached during winter. I have just started doing research into weather and climate but all I'm saying is that the results I've found throughout this past year have been significantly higher than usual. It's weird how no one's talking about this spike yet so many people all over Europe have pointed out to me that they have felt it themselves. I don't know if this is the new trend for global warming or not but if it is we're screwed because I've never experienced such heat by a milestone. Anyway, just be aware that North America has a very unstable climate. Europe is always temperate because of the gulf stream so you will feel the mild changes whereas in let's say Wisconsin, it can be 5°C one day, the day after there could be a snow storm at let's say -3°C on average and the day after that, it's a sunny day at -15°C. This is why I prefer to study weather patterns around Europe. I just really hope this spike in temperature is only temporary. Only time will tell. To determine the climate of an area you need if I've not mistaken 30 years of research so that's gonna take quite a bit of time",UCkSJCkytTxIUvKc_oYakb8w,1,UgzaK-hVxt_FjI_4NGl4AaABAg,ZfFvLJyPf3o,2020-05-19 14:30:02

I know a few Germans who have told me that Bavaria has gotten very little snow compared to last year. As well as that, Northern Germany only got snow on the 30th March, which is quite a weird date tbh considering it hadn't snowed before then at all. I grew up in London but I currently live in Italy because of family reasons. We have obviously had no snow here as Rome has quite a warm climate but I asked 3 friends from London if they had had any snow and they told me that they only got sleet towards the end of February. I know a Youtuber from Helsinki who said that the weather in Finland has been hotter than usual and they barely had snow. Some guy from Southern Norway also described this winter as hot and another one said it literally felt like autumn. A Youtuber from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania went to Upper Michigan to do an experiment by shooting snow and he said he couldn't do it this year in Pittsburgh because over there they had only had 8 inches of snow (this was January btw). He acted like it was nothing but I knew what was really going on. In my spare time, I also search up the weather in places around the world just for curiosity. Tbh, I wish I had plotted the statistics for different places throughout last winter. It would have been really interesting to check my results and compare them to the annual/monthly average. I should probably talk about how unbearable last Summer was but I won't because otherwise my comment would be way too long.",UCkSJCkytTxIUvKc_oYakb8w,1,UgzaK-hVxt_FjI_4NGl4AaABAg,ZfFvLJyPf3o,2020-05-19 14:30:02

As for the currently tropical regions, they&#39;ll receive more rainfall and more storms unless if the rainforests were chopped down. My overall point is that most of Earth won&#39;t become desert, but instead, the areas that have dry climates will become even dryer while the wet climates will be even more wet, either by rainfall or the ocean.

It is also factually accurate to say the period on record and before accurate record keeping the tree ring and Icecap records show a period of time we refer to the mid-evil warming period which more then likely led to the rise of the Vikings era, But thats neither here nor now I guess as thats almost ancient history. You can argue and be correct that CO2 is higher then in anytime in human history but to know how big of an impact the a miniscule amount of raise actually has as an effect on the climate is the argument that the skeptical people have especially when there is literally potentially hundreds of billions of tax payer money up for grabs. When you're talking about 100 parts per million of CO2 level raise it is a tiny amoint. Think about that for a moment in terms of money thats like having a million bucks and loosing a dollar or gaining a buck you're still pretty much at a million regardless of the direction. When we see things like inaccurate predictions such as sea level rise or time limits on how long we have left ( I remember Al Gore lieing to me back in 1987 how we would be under water and I definitely remember AOC telling me the end is in 12 yeara over a year ago.

Subsequently, there will be regions also closer to the equator with plenty of rain. Moreover, the higher levels of CO2 in the atmosphere will actually decrease the plants need for water (look it up). However, it is important to remember that the extra rain has the potential to fall in less pleasant patterns, with some regions drying up and others getting flooded.

Also I think much of what is said is just false. <br /><br />The Video makes it sound like after 3/4 of the world containing around 98% of its population becoming a desert is just something that will happen and is going to work out fine. The consequences that would have are barely mentioned. Just think about the wars that would be fought just for access to water and the billions of refugees dying at the borders of the last few remaining spots on earth left habitable. To think they would all just be able to relocate in Russia, Scandinavia or NZ is naive. Just think about how fast Europe shut its borders after just 2 million people trying to get in! <br /><br />What I think is falsely portrayed in the video is agriculture. I&#39;m not a specialist but I learned a lot about the effects of climate change and a huge part of that was the smashing of the dream of huge farms in Greenland or Siberia. Plants need more than just ok weather. To grow plants take nutritions and organic waste that is buried in the ground. That&#39;s actually what the soil is made up of. Anyway, the soil in Scandinavia, Siberia or Antarctica has been extremely frozen for thousands of years. The plants will simply not be able to grow there. The consequence? With most of the current farmlands being deserts and a huge displaced population we will have mass starving. <br /><br />Overall this video paints some kind of semi-optimistic picture that has given up upon trying to change that future.

When the water cycle becomes bigger global temperatures actually will approach average not just straight up increase by 4 degrees. So storms and and hurricanes will become absolutely massive in comparison to today but on the bright side rainfall will most likely increase on average. <br />It’s just that it’s going to fuck over most developing countries.<br />Also take any predictions too exact with a grain of sand. Because we really do not have the tools necessary to predict what the world will be like. The only thing we know is that the oceans are going to get fucked hard.

Reality of course would be much, much more violent and downright apocalyptic. It would be likely that Fascist regimes would spring up almost everywhere, either pledging to use their military force to keep starving people out or countries invading their neighbours to secure lush and habitable &#39;Lebensraum&#39; or living space for there populations to move to. Countries like the UK, Island, New Zealand and Australia would be in the best position to withstand the shocks to come. Mainly because they are island nations that are far easier to defend against than countries like Canada who is almost certainly going to be staring down another US invasion or Russia who has the prospect to keep out billions of starving Chinese refugees across thousands of kilometres of borders. Particularly with New Zealand and Australia is that they both reside in the southern hemisphere where only a tenth of the world&#39;s population lives and have thousands of kilometres of ocean between them and most of the world, they would be in the best position to survive into the end of the century.<br /><br />Another thing is that all that warmed tundra wouldn&#39;t be available immediately for agriculture. Arctic soils are acidic, poor in nutrients and are very thin. It might take thousands of years for a soil to form that could support crops. India and Pakistan would almost certainly go to regional nuclear war over the vanishing Himalayan river systems. But no matter how I say it, the world that is four degrees warmer wouldn&#39;t be able to support more than a small fraction of the human population that we have now.<br /><br />You read about Climate Change and few books and documentaries go to a four degree world or if they do, it is only lightly touched on to avoid turning off its viewers/readers.

The climate models that have been dreamed up are crap they predict nothing and match no observations. When you use them to try and predict past climates thousands of years ago they give crazy numbers that would end all life on earth. What if I told you we &quot;don&#39;t know&quot; magical little words. Most of what we do know relies on what we call &quot;settled science&quot; which is just a bunch of assumptions we have built are whole understanding of the world on layer after layer up guess work we don&#39;t even know what the sun is... Its most certainly not a nuclear camp fire in space no nuclear model even comes close to explaining everything we observe. Keep that in mind as we enter solar cycle 25 don&#39;t you just love how are sun is basically a clock.,UCG_QBMJmhej2gJOvzde3GeA,0,UgziF3ovL6QiDDL3_rt4AaABAg,ZfFvLJyPf3o,2020-05-19 14:30:02

The energy yield is much higher & the perks are greater. They generate no waste at all besides water vapor & helium (both useful things), the fuel they use is hydrogen (the most abundant thing in the universe & with vast stores of the deuterium & tritium isotopes on the moon), they cannot melt down under any circumstance, etc. etc. Fusion is the perfect energy source, which is why we've been working on it for so long. It will also not be our solution to climate change, but as a long term energy solution, it is the absolute ideal & superior to thorium in every way. In the mean time, it will be solar, wind, hydro power, geothermal, conventional fission, & other clean energy sources that will get us off of fossil fuels & bridge the gap to fusion power.",UCwmw9QrqK1EZx3DFMxDGYUA,1,Ugzibnv4vYKpVLlE31h4AaABAg,ZfFvLJyPf3o,2020-05-19 14:30:02

I haven&#39;t read the book it was taken from, but it seems that all the author did was take the existing climate zones and shift them a number of degrees of latitude towards the poles. This seems overly simplistic and differs from other models of climate change I have seen. Does this model account, for instance, the disruption to ocean currents caused by a decrease in ocean salinity due to ice melt, or for the increase in atmospheric water content in a warmer, wetter world. Additionally, I don&#39;t believe that sub-polar regions would suddenly become hospitable for agriculture even if they were warmer, because they would still receive relatively little sunlight year-round, so it would be a challenge to farm there.

Siberia&#39;s soil is thin, acidic and largely unsuitable for agriculture, the same goes for the Canadian and Scandinavian arctic. Efforts to farm Iceland resulted in most of the country&#39;s soil eroding away in the middle ages. Antarctica and Greenland have no soil at all under their ice-sheets. It takes at least 200 years for enough soil to form to support lage-scale agriculture. Any effort to farm these areas before topsoil can properly form would have the same result as Nikita Khruschev&#39;s virgin lands scheme.<br />There is also the fact that there is absolutley no way states could survive and be organised enough to carry out a programme of resetlement and colonisation in this scenario. Consider the political chaos that has ensued as a reuslt of a few million Syrians being displaced (the Syrian civil war was partly triggered by cliamte change BTW) now imagine what sort of chaos would reuslt from the entire population of China, most of India, all of Bangladesh nearly all of Latin America and most of the United Sates having to up sticks and move. We are looking at perhaps five or six billion people being relocated. Consider how our society has ground to a halt when faced by a pandemic that, compared to most plagues throughout history, is extremely minor.

Canada is lucky if it avoids suffering the fate it did in the ""Fallout"" games. I mean how can ANYONE say with a straight face that the UNITED NATIONS could intervene ANYWHERE in such a situation? They would be the FIRST institution to go. What is going to happen is that the current powers will fight the potential future powers. Canada will either be brutally annexed or merge with the US. Then they might take Greenland too, or Europe will cut a deal and backed by the French Nukes they will take Greenland China and Russia will get into a massive war. Because everyone will want what Russia has. There might be civil war in Europe around the resettlements of the muslims of the middle east. A religious war, leading to widescale genocidal extermination of whoever loses is quite probable. Out of pure convenience it is actually not impossible for white supremacy to become the dominant ideology, as it unites those having the good land against the desparate and taken to its brutal conclusion still ""only"" requires the nations to exterminate (because let´s face it expulsion equals death) parts of their populations that they could theoretically live without. YES, it can get THAT bad and it still gets worse. Russia might pursue a pan slavic state, taking in much of eastern Europe. That could actually go smoothly enough. Japan will invade Russia again and try to claim a piece. Possibly, Russia might straight up first strike nuke China or make some deal with Japan and south Korea to give them parts of eastern siberia instead. Or they might ally with China instead, that could be a viable option too, which would now lead to Japan dying off.

This current has shut down in the past, and is showing signs of doing so again. The culprit: melting ice. So if if keeps getting warmer, more ice melts, and europe will become 4 degress colder instead of warmer. Not the only thing the video gets wrong.

The reason there’s the Saharan desert in the first place is because East Asia blocked the rain from passing into the Middle East and Northern Africa. <br /><br />Which means that the desert will not expand to encompass the entire world. But it will move more north or more south depending on its hemisphere.

We have warmed the planet by 1.1°C so far yet we have seen terrible effects already from extreme storms, heat waves, and droughts. A 4° to 5°C rise would be terrible. Sea levels will rise by 2-4 meters, we will sea mass extinctions and more. The current Holoence Interglacial climate is what gage rise to civilization, coupled degrees warmer, humans can’t survive. A good way to look at the current warming is by looking at the PETM 56 million years ago, Earths temperature rose 5-8°C in 20,000 years. Tropical Rainforests covered the Arctic while extreme desserts covered the equator, life even than was hard for life recovery from the extinction that wiped out the dinosaurs. Than CO2 was being put in the air at 0.1 ppmv per year, now humans are pumping CO2 at 3 ppmv per year. Current CO2 levels are around 415 ppmv by 2100 that could be 1,000 ppmv similar to the PETM. <br />The debate wether humans are causing global warming is over. We know it’s real, we know humans are causing it and as a student studying the science in school now and sickens me that people deny science. The Anthropocene is here, it’s time to take care of it. Science is real, denial can’t happen. <br />I live in the New York Metro Area and we are seeing more extreme coastal flooding, extreme heat waves and more hurricanes.

Some deserts would expand, but most deserts would actually shrink since that higher rainfall and more active evaporation over larger oceans would result in a hot, humid earth and many areas would find relief from high temperatures through cloud cover.<br />Edit: This map also largely ignores changing ocean currents (bringing humid air to vast regions) and rain capture and rain shadow effects caused by mountains.",UChGLN5Wicw3hL-MUwxonHIg,0,UgzMZpcMxB0yDEHMQWN4AaABAg,ZfFvLJyPf3o,2020-05-19 14:30:02

Just turn to Him. <br /><br />Did you know that God loves you very much? You are His precious creation. He knows everyhing about you, the good and the bad. God desires you to come and talk to Him and for you to find rest and peace in Him. God created you to love and for you to love him. He wants you to spend eternity in Heaven with Him. That is why he sent His Son Jesus Christ to save you. Jesus paid your sin debt by willingly dying in our place. Now that is true love! Jesus is alive...He conquered death and he is coming back very soon. Please receive Jesus Christ as your Savior today...He is the one &amp; only Way to Heaven.<br /><br />WHAT TO DO:<br />Just go to Jesus Christ with a humble heart, repent and put your trust in Jesus as your Lord and Savior, committing your life to Jesus.<br /><br />AN EXAMPLE PRAYER:<br />Jesus Christ, I come to you a sinner, I repent of living my life away from you and ask for your forgiveness. I believe you are the Son of God, that you went to the cross, died in my place, paying my sin debt and that you were buried &amp; rose on the 3rd day to everlasting life. Jesus, right now, I choose to receive you as my Lord and my Savior, trusting in you alone for my salvation. I surrender my life to you and ask for your will to be done. I invite your Holy Spirit to come into my heart to make me more like you. Thank you for your forgiveness. Thank you for filling me with the Holy Spirit and for your gift of eternal life in Heaven. Amen!<br /><br />NOW WHAT:<br />Being a Christian is all about relationship. You grow in your relationship with God as you spend time with Him, in your Bible, in prayer, in time of worship and praise.

I can clearly see the rise of British empire once again while USA's power will be reduced to 3rd best just behind RUSSIA and it will be playing the same secondary role just like Australia , Canada or NZ performs for the USA against China or any other adversary but now on reverse order ! Now why UK will becomes the most powerful country in the world again ?! Good question you ask ! Remember all those country like Australia or NZ or Canada or Ireland including UK itself turns into a green habitable zones , turns out to be that the Queen of England , is still the Queen of all those three countries I mentioned above (not USA and Russia obviously !) and they are more culturally and systematically close to England than the USA itself ! Ex. Kilometers , Liters and patrol vs Miles , Gallons and Gasoline ! The old great game may play out itself again between the British empire vs Russia in which all those 4 Nordic countries will simply fall in line for the Queen/King due to Russia's intention to swallow them and USA will be gradually reduced to 2nd in command in global affairs due to fall in productivity ! On what side will Germany chose , will mean some more leg room and head space for any of the bloc it may choose to go ! UK as a historical and traditional country have all the necessary experience and skills required for successfully running an Empire on a truly global scale unlike others !",UCRRt9rDKoKOg4S0DED8fNlg,1,UgwTZaVMUEr27jTTFmx4AaABAg,ZfFvLJyPf3o,2020-05-19 14:30:02
