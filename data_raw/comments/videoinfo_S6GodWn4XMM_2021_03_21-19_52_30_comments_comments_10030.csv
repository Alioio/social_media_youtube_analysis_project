Laymen have no way of spotting the mistakes the deniers, ignorantly or more likely knowingly, make in the scientific process. It's the same for ContraPoints.

Those ""100 companies"" (not corporations) are ALL fossil fuel Producers/Miners, blaming them for the emissions is like blaming Ford for car accidents involving their cars! Not only that, here are a few other facts about those ""100 Companies"": • Only 1/5 (20%) of their fossil fuels are from investor owned companies. • One of those ""Companies"" (by far the biggest producer) is CHINA'S ENTIRE COAL MARKET! It is just listed as a ""Company"" because it's all State-owned. • One the ""Companies"" is Russia's Entire Coal market. • Most of those fossil fuels produced (59%) are from state owned companies • Every time you drive a car, use electricity, Etc. You are likely burning fuels (or using electricity that had to burn fuels to be produced) from one if those ""100 Companies"" therefore YOU are directly adding to the ""71% of Emissions"". The whole point of that Study was to try and trace to back which companies Fossil Fuels come from, so research could be conducted as to what these companies (and state producers) can do to move forward to eventually produce renewable energy, and so more pressure could be put on the biggest Fossil fuel producers (China is biggest), not the smallest. All this information is from the actual report (Carbon majors report: 2017) TL;DR: Those ""100 Companies"" are all fossil fuel producers and they don't ""produce"" ANY of that 71%, they simple extract the Coal, Oil and Gas; Which is then burned in YOUR car, in Power Stations to produce Electricity for you, in planes Etc",UCKuEENTaOW6HitKjZ8hllyg,1,UgwK0444fiMBOSuILoF4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

People who say that dolphins are shape-shifting werewolfs don't get past undergrad either. There is simply a belief system in place, and the existence of a belief system does not necessarily mean that which is being believed is true. And those who go against the belief system do not advance. 100% of scientists who publish those papers get funded to do so. Again, this is not a conspiracy, it's just the way the culture developed. (And that people on the left tend to want paradigm change much more than the right, and climate change one thing that will force paradigm change) There is a belief system in place, those who accord with the belief system advance, and when they do the studies they conclude that yes, that which they believe is true. Science is not an exact science, for lack of a better way to put it, there is room to maneuver, especially in complex systems, modelling, statistics. Logically, the existence of a belief system does not necessitate the truth of that which is believed. That this many people believe climate catastrophe to be true does not automatically make it true, nor does it bring one any closer to the truth.

It's almost as if we are purposely taking stores of solid, liquid and Carbon gas and sending them into the air across the globe as fast as we can and at increasing rates every year... which of course is something that we know we are doing. It's just the scale of things is difficult to wrap our heads around,... and the gas is transparent, the changes to weather do not effect us every day, the people and companies doing well are fighting every change to the status quo, and the problem is diffuse across all nations... This is why climate researchers are often depressed; it's like they are telling the community a massive brush fire is building up and heading our way, and the community says, 'lets not upset the status quo by addressing this now', or 'I don't smell smoke so I don't believe you'. And meanwhile even the progress being made by people at the front line is only enough to better understand the severity if the disasters headed our way... Wrapping up this rant, I am in the field of medical research, but I fully recognize that climate change is the challenge of our time, and our response will define this period of human civilization going forward. We will be the age that caused but averted disaster, or the age that caused disaster and regressed humanity back into another dark age of famine, migration, and wars for land and resources.

Wanting to score brownie points for being &quot;woke&quot; is always a shitty reason for anything, and the amount of your impact is miniscule, given the trade-offs there are with switching from cattle farming to growing vegetables. Also, vegetables have little nutritional value in terms of protein, fats and carbs, so you gotta eat beans, chickpeas and the like, along with nuts and seeds, which is just begging for a sexual joke, so make up one in your head, not gonna limit anyone&#39;s creativity. Switching to vegan, though, is highly questionable: there are vitamins and micronutrients that ONLY come from animal sources, so you&#39;re either not gonna receive them at all, which is suboptimal, or consume micronutrient complexes that harvest those nutrients from animal sources, so in short: you&#39;re either not getting shit you need, or just being a hypocrite and may as well just eat hotdogs, because they&#39;re approximately near micronutrient complexes in terms of percentages of animal-friendly and not-so-friendly stuff. Just saying, not to discourage anyone – go ham, just be aware of your options and tricky moments. In short: if you don&#39;t know 100% that some product is not made with results of some form of animal cruelty and the package won&#39;t let you know it 100%, just avoid that product in general, or be ready to get called out for dietary transgressions, because you might as well just shove actual meat down your gullet while nobody&#39;s watching.",UCPSzxwlPNA-0b72YRODzZBA,0,UgwwZzlB64EUTwa1wTF4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

You are right that it is hard to determine the exact temperature because of all the variables involved. But you can get very, very good estimates. Why? Well, because most of the variables only produce very, very, very small effects!

Even Natalie has made a video attacking autogynephilia, although she by no means represents the most extreme example of denialism with respect to this (the video doesn&#39;t really empirically contradict the theory, but she makes it seem like the theory is <b>completely</b> wrong just by pointing out a few shortcomings, and allows the more extreme AGP denialists to feel like their ideas are scientifically supported when they aren&#39;t).

Things like electric cars still pollute, since batteries use lithium who&#39;s mining process is gruesome to the environment and most energy sources to power up those batteries aren&#39;t green, either because it isn&#39;t lucrative enough, still not a good investment, and because it hasn&#39;t developed enough to be able to meet the increasing energy demands. Going vegan and other individual measures can help, but it&#39;s also important to consider that a lot of economically undeveloped countries don&#39;t have a market for these products because people can&#39;t afford it, poorer people and countries can&#39;t afford to care about the environment. This is also an international problem in a way, when trump says its a Chinese hoax to decrease American productivity he is not necessarily wrong. I mean the hoax part is bullshit of course, but it is true that in a global economy no country can stay behind or either quality of life decreases drastically or suddenly oh my the state owes billions to the UN monetary fund or the European Union. I see this as a structural problem of the highest magnitude, and essentially a result of capitalism although capitalism has become something of a shitty argument since its used so lightly. But truthly, I can&#39;t see a way out of this mess. I haven&#39;t just thrown my hands to the air yet, I hope to see humanity succeed, but it would require such a great structural change to our lives, general way of thinking about the world and also the economic or production system that is in place that it seems to me that only when we are balls deep into this mess will people finally scramble to find an answer, politicians and the common folk.

Let's pretend you were arguing against specifically environmental veganism. In 2018 the global meat consumption was roughly 346.14 million t, of that about 2.11 million t was wild game. This is roughly 0.6%. Even if we were to assume that this can be doubled, people would have to reduce their meat consumption by almost 99%. Furthermore the production of animal products like milk and eggs is virtually impossible without captive animals and entirely impossible at the current consumption levels (again, without captive animals). All in all, if the world were to follow your idea of consuming animal products without captive animals meat consumption would have to be reduced to less than 300g (if we look at current levels, about 550g if the production of wild game was doubled) per year and person. The consumption of things like dairy and eggs would almost certainly have to be reduced by an even greater degree.

You may, (or may not), wish to know that you are not entirely correct. Doctor Fauci, someone whom everyone but Trump, (and his fans) believe in, has also referred to COVID as the 'Global Pandemic"". An explanation of this, according to Doctor James Gideon, is: ""... global pandemic emphasizes the fact that it is likely to involve the entire world rather than one or two continents. The black plague was a pandemic but didn’t involve the entire world, just killed about half of Europe and probably similar in Asia. Because we are interconnected more than ever anything like this will indeed be a worldwide pandemic."" Or, if that isn't quite enough to soothe your savage mood, consider this point, by Eamon Lynch: ""A pandemic could by pass Australia and New Zealand or by pass The UK and Ireland but be otherwise world wide which with crossing international borders, causing illness, and impacting on large populations forms the pandemic definition. ""Globally pandemic therefore has the descriptive meaning of a pandemic that reaches every country in the world"".

The tower is reaching for the sky. And the children sing the praises of their god king because they believe if they stop the world will end.<br /><br />A shake makes the children startle and they stop singing. The tower crumbles. The king rises and kneels before the empty pedestal. He digs his fingers into the earth and beneath the pristine grass there is only dead sand. He scoops up the sand and begins to eat it and the more he eats the more he changes until standing before the pedestal is the naked beginning of man... looking at us with blank disappointment.,UC33S2tnuMxNRfcQPt-zq4uw,0,UgykUVrZb0v5JUEypSJ4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

Go vegan for peace and the planet<br />&quot;&quot;The study, published in the journal Science, created a huge dataset based on almost 40,000 farms in 119 countries and covering 40 food products that represent 90% of all that is eaten. It assessed the full impact of these foods, from farm to fork, on land use, climate change emissions, freshwater use and water pollution (eutrophication) and air pollution (acidification).<br /><br />“A vegan diet is probably the single biggest way to reduce your impact on planet Earth, not just greenhouse gases, but global acidification, eutrophication, land use and water use,” said Joseph Poore, at the University of Oxford, UK, who led the research. “It is far bigger than cutting down on your flights or buying an electric car,” he said, as these only cut greenhouse gas emissions.<br /><br />The new research shows that without meat and dairy consumption, global farmland use could be reduced by more than 75% – an area equivalent to the US, China, European Union and Australia combined – and still feed the world.

This year my home nation of New Zealand unanimously passed the Zero Carbon Act which aims for NZ to become carbon neutral by 2050.

And there is the Waddenzee, which is an area in the north that periodically totally floods. But if the climate change predictions are correct, pretty much all of our biggest city area (including Amsterdam, The Hague, Rotterdam and more) will turn into the lost city of Atlantis unless we seriously step up our water management game.

You really don&#39;t even need a deep understanding of economics to understand the behavior of corporations and their stance on climate change. Currently, the cost of energy to produce goods is artificially low due to government subsidies of the oil and coal industries. Add to this, the fast rising solar, wind, and hydro fuel industries. Though solar technology is developing exponentially and costs are decreasing, oil is still a subjectively cheaper alternative to produce goods and fuel everything else in our lives. Until the marginal cost of an additional unit of solar energy is equal to or less than the marginal cost of an additional unit of say, oil or coal, we will not see any action from corporations other than the green pandering we see through marketing campaigns. What can we as the consumers do in the face of production theory? Well use consumer theory of course! Vote with our dollars. Now more than ever we are capable of becoming informed consumers. With a quick google search one can easily look into the business practices of almost any company or industry; albeit, some are more difficult to access than others. No one wants you to stop living your American consumerist fantasy. Just, become more informed about who you are giving money to. If there is a significant enough reaction from consumers, it will cut into the bottom lines of these polluting companies, and they will make changes to their production methods. Or at least in theory, if they are rational, profit maximizing corporations, they will. The crux of it all is the assumption of rationality, which isn&#39;t as common as we unfortunately would like it to be.",UCFrc-weuDfeebLS6bK-XDYA,0,Ugz_qwgCt0Z80kmxlwV4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

The winters every year seem to be getting— well, not milder, they’re still really cold, but there’s less snow. In the spring, instead of having more snow but muddier, we’ve been getting patterns of rain that rapidly refreezes, which makes the ground really dry and shitty. This is not good for a province that relies heavily on the farming industry, and also <i>anyone who doesn’t want to drive through a dust storm made by some asshole who hates cover crops.</i> In the past two years, there’s been occurrences that are nicknamed “weatherbombs” by uncreative radio show hosts. Basically, there’s half a day of extremely rainy, windy weather, especially towards the end of the summer through fall. They happen infrequently (maybe a few per year, although they’re increasing in 2019) but <i>they also suck</i> because you can’t step outside without your shoes being soaked all the way through and <i>congratulations, you have to spend the rest of the day feeling like you’re walking around in shoes full of fucking soup.</i> And then we have Hurricane Dorian. Hurricanes don’t usually get this far north, so we were all pretty unprepared. Every house lost at least one tree, the power was out for weeks for some people, and this was all from a <i>Category 1 hurricane. Fuck you, Whorian.</i> The summers are warmer though, right? Yeah, which means <i>an ungodly amount of mosquitoes and black flies trying to consume my flesh at every waking moment which I don’t spend huddling under a blanket in fear of our new insectoid overlords.</i> Also, erosion! When you live on a giant chunk of sandstone that’s relatively expected but the idea that my house, all of the only reasonably sized town in the entire province, and a large population of adorable foxes will be underwater in maybe less than a century if fossil fuel companies continue to fuck shit up is <i>just a little alarming.</i> Anyway, that was my climate change rant, peace.",UC8MvXHefG3wn0ZynSsnNNSg,0,UgwAjf2JlkWCni6w57Z4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

Furthermore, this democracy [while ideal only in the plebian socius &amp; well, what would now be, frankly, small Greek cities- cf. The Republic] still is &quot;governed&quot; by an elected &quot;elite&quot; [they act it, don&#39;t they?], yet they are not &quot;elites&quot; [&quot;greats&quot;], they are just acting- also this government, thru banking interests, and oil interests [thru &quot;business&quot; interests, hence, banking interests] instigated much of coup by way of foist. Bush is a clear example of this. His legacy continues to this day. Now you might ask, &quot;why Democracy&quot;? Because democracy led to the inclination to elect the &quot;chosen few&quot; in the first place, all groomed alike, to take part in their long-games- socialists, too, have their part to play- look at &quot;democratic socialism&quot;- at every mention in history, it&#39;s twain with the worst affliction. War breaks out with communism&#39;s rise, against the conservatives of what was once a [classically] liberal Germany [enough so, that it split quite concisely along those lines, after the war], and with that, democratic socialism was the &quot;third party&quot; vying for control. But democratic socialism is not &quot;socialism&quot; in the ideal sense of Marx or Orwell. It isn&#39;t the insurrectionary [Blanquism] or &quot;social&quot; [in the sense of being thru &quot;the state apparatus&quot;] but was literally a utopia. A vision of man no more at odds with time and space. Alas, I digress. From the loss of the structure of these values [creating the superstructure of production and profit, and class divide], the worst abusers of government powers became empowered by way of guile, and this foist continues to betray the populace.<br /><br />By way of involution, nationalism, the world wars, econonisms, zionism, &quot;spreading democracy&quot;, warfare via allegiances of banking &amp; political elites, all lead to the incursion into the middle east, q.e.d.",UCjnH3B0xlpGRARCQblg21tw,0,UgzGggS3BMntOLAXYop4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

One of the reasons some people are childfree is due to environmental causes (less people=less consumerism=less pollution). On average, there&#39;s about 58.2 tons of CO2 produced per person per year in north America. I know that in the immediate, it&#39;s mostly corporations that need to reduce their CO2 emissions in order to slow down climate change before it&#39;s too late, but in the long haul, I believe we need to start &#39;&#39;downsizing&#39;&#39; and consuming less in general in order for those corporations to stop producing as much. We always hear about how people could stop using their cars and use public transport instead or how people need to start consuming more plants instead of meat, but I never hear anyone talk about how one of the most efficient ways for a person to help the environment on a more individual level is to simply have less children or no children at all (or at the very least, to consider adoption instead of a biological child.

Arguing for the existence of climate change is just a waste of time, everyone (well, pretty much) knows about it. Knowing about it does not change anything. In a way, climate change does not have much to do with anything scientific or economical. <b>The climate change issue IS NOT about the climate change facts.</b><br />The core problem is this: it&#39;s all a question of the present and the future, considered at the individual(ist) level. Most young people DO NOT CARE about their own future (I&#39;m certainly one of them), and we constantly make decisions, and adopt behaviors that GO AGAINST the very idea of &quot;OUR&quot; future, taken here again at an individual level. Do these millenials who spend so much time on video games think about their long-term career? Do all these fat people in the States who gorge on fast-food think about their own health? We all know that we are essentially wasting our time watching dumb series, shitty movies and useless YouTube videos, or bad-taste pictures &amp; comments on social media... but we still do it anyways. Because you know what? OH FUCK THE FUTURE! I&#39;m right now doing what I want to do because... reasons! even if it&#39;s bad FOR ME. <br />And then someone shows up and tell us that in 50-70 or a 100 years the PLANET is going to be fucked up. How is it that we&#39;re gonna care? I mean a huge chunk of young people would take it with a shrug if you told them that their OWN FUCKING LIFE would end in 15 years or so. So, such an abstraction as &quot;the planet&quot;, in a time where they don&#39;t exist anymore... Of course it does not change anything to their lives. It&#39;s as you went to Japan, and talked with the young people. They know that their society is going to have a huge problem because of the increasing average age of the population (Japan has the oldest age per person in the world, on average). Now does that mean that THEY, individually, are going to start having kids? No way. They acknowledge, they know very well the problem, but they won&#39;t do anything about it. <br />Heck, so many people actually WANT the Apocalypse (if it existed) to happen. The &quot;Apocalypse&quot;&#39;s very idea says more about our DESIRES rather than any fact or argument, it&#39;s the pulsion of Death that Freud talks about.<br />No one&#39;s gonna really care about some shit happening to the &quot;planet&quot; in 20+ or 50+ years. That&#39;s the truth of it. So if you wanna do something about it anyways, a new strategy has got to be implemented. The current one that just scientifically demonstrates that bad shit will happen is missing the point.",UC4uyXf0WbAaFIRcu0McDx0w,0,UgzGeKwil4SRKkLtndx4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

Whether it&#39;s a simple stare that expresses a simultaneous combination of judgement and disgust, or being audibly disgusted and diving into a lecture about meat that&#39;s filled with cherry picked, out of context facts, deception by omission, and outright lies.<br /><br />Just for example... I&#39;ve been lectured to by a Vegan for eating honey. The claim was that bee keepers pull the wings off of queen bees to keep the queens from leaving the hive. This is an outright lie. The worker bees themselves prevent the queen from leaving the hive. Bee keepers need to do nothing about it and in fact they do nothing about it.<br /><br />When I pointed that out in response, I was told about how the entire hive is killed to harvest the honey... Which again is false, but besides that, I get my honey from a local apiary that uses flow hives. Flow hives are so humane that no bee is ever even so much as bothered by the harvesting of honey. If the hive is ever killed in regards to a flow hive, it&#39;s killed by winter weather, which would happen regardless of the type of hive if it&#39;s kept outdoors.<br /><br />The only valid points ever raised to me by vegans are only an argument to be conscientious about who I get my animal products from, as the only valid points have to do with a way that only some farmers do things.<br /><br /><br />If a vegan has no problem with what I choose to eat, I have no problem with what they choose to not eat...

And the same can be said about cis and trans people. Most cis people know nothing about trans people. We can go on with chromosomes, fluid and construct for 100 years and no one will understand what we are really feeling. It wasn&#39;t until I started listening to others vulnerable honest truths. This morning I thought trans trenders were just political, attention and fashion statements. A couple you tube videos, articles and chat that didn&#39;t use a canned lecture changed my view that this group doesn&#39;t see themselves as cis, some don&#39;t know where they are on gender spectrum, some are in early transition. A few honest conversations changed my mind.<br /><br />And some cis people may see that they have adopted a life time of living a life of fulfilling society&#39;s expectations of being what they were told a man is and its a narrow path when they see a trans person. They may feel uncomfortable because someone who&#39;s identity is one they never encountered before and may not be sure and how to treat them.<br />And for a good amount of people sex and gender are the same thing.

But (trigger) theories are just theories. <br />This large dominate view point has thousands of years to back it up <br /><br />Yes there were third gender is some societies. But few are modern day, few have real life experience with them. That India has hijra is about as relatable Chinese footbinding. <br /><br />For a good chunk of this cis group is about reproduction.

Women feel like &quot;not a real woman&quot; when she reached menopause or having children is a challenge or impossible or others thought that.

Toss away capitalism and whatever takes its place will also ultimately fail to address climate change. Society needs to undergo a paradigm shift regarding the housing process (the biggest contributor to climate change and social inequality) in order to address climate change. Robust housing, built to be functional for 5 to 10 times the average human lifespan, with the cost spread out over centuries (to be affordable) is a solution that will work. But, don&#39;t look for governments or businesses to ever embrace this idea. The government likes to control the economy by adjusting interest rates (which by the way, are not a force of nature--completely made up and not needed: 30 year mortgage--screw this, go to 250 years, smaller payment) and corporations (like Goldman Sachs, etc.) make far too much money from the financing of homes. Remember the Great Recession? Caused by--the housing process. We make homes disposable these days--more turns in the business cycle means more profits for those that build homes. Protesting at state Building Code meetings would be more useful than in Washington DC. Who writes those codes, anyway? Insurance companies and contractors, mostly--environmentalists--not so much. Cool thing about addressing housing design for environmental reasons is that homelessness will also be addressed as a by-product. Those interested in solving climate change should also be interested in designing homes and designing financing organizations so such homes can be built. Totally doable. I wish I were as charismatic and pretty as Natalie so I could explain all this with delectable style so people would understand.

And its population control over livestock... its basic ecosystem upkeeping. I know its a &quot;human&quot; generated system as cows would obviously not mass produce in the speed they do, but currently due to human intervention there is just overpopulation...if you would let all the livestock go they would harm our generic ecosystem as it is. Its like when there was a japaneese city that competly eliminated a type of bird to be killed - then the bugs got overpopulated and ate all the farmers green stock :D so humans almsot starved to death... ecosystem is a bitch and once humans fuk it up its very hard to recover it without consequences. Altough I agree that if someone is a vegan I personally have nothing to do with it. But I fail to see actually what are the benefits of being a vegan besides being thin and being able to claim that I am &quot;vegan&quot;... to me it adds no value to the way of my living. I can live healthy with or without being vegan so its just something humans make up. But the truth to be told ecosystems are not to be fuked. W e really were designed to be predators for a reason... we - even though we fight a lot not to - should be fitting into this ecosystem... but being vegan is not the way. Being restrictive and not abusing the system is... but no one preaches that... cause that would actually rob money out of economics :3",UCcPjHP9gnGs0Wf81Yjb7wBg,0,UgwWBBfofxbXEVsycO14AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

All this veganism, if it is not done for religious reasons and completed with the rest of a religious moral code, is just virtue signaling. Why she just did not take out the pepperoni and be done with it? Why vegans have to lecture us that animals are alive (breaking news) and blames us of global warming? Like if people before the industrial did not eat meat (think about the indians in the US, their culture revolve around the buffalo because it was their food, but they did not destroy the enviroment just because they were meat eaters.) Do you have moral crisis when you buy ""organic vegan food"" harvested by animals known as humans in third world countries?

I do not think that global emissions and climate change are the major threat to the planet but the consequences of climate change are very serious and rarely spoken of. A third world war ending in a nuclear fight is far more likely to eradicate life on the planet than increase in temperature. You can adapt to pH and larger temperatures but you won't adapt to radiation. Why do I speak of a third world war? Certainly because with the increased tension between the US and China there will be a conflict between the two within the next few decades.

The ""spot the vegan"" well from what I've seen is indeed a knee jerk reaction but not out of guilt but a reaction to pompous or uninformed behavior on the part of the vegan. For example I've seen on the internet a vegan post stuff on the internet that tries to trick people. Vegans saying we different evolve to eat meat. There's this one vegan I've met who proudly shared she can get high without drugs whenever she wants thanks to veganism. (A couple guys were impressed and considered trying veganism for that reason) but I knew she was promoting an unhealthy lifestyle because you're body is not supposed to randomly get high. That has to mean something is wrong if you feel ""natural highs"". With vegans like this (I know, not all vegans) it's no surprise that people have a knee jerk reaction to it but I don't think it should be mistaken for guilt. Again, you might just be a special case.

Since nothing is 100% efficient, excess carbon emissions are produced when you get your electricity from a power company that is then transported (which also wastes energy) to you.

In my opinion, I believe that perhaps both sides of this issue or in similar situations. I think that people who believe in the future catastrophes from climate change might be taking it a little too extreme, but I also believe that people who think it doesn’t exist don’t take it seriously enough. It is funny the hypocritical nature of using science to invalidate transgender individuals but at the same time not use it to validate the reality of climate change. <br /><br />All of that being said, the reason that there is such an intense debate about this is because it is hard to know what is the truth. Conservatives aren’t stupid. Liberals aren’t stupid. We are just unfortunately tied up in misinformation and out right dishonesty, all of which are used to progress certain agendas. Climate change isn’t going to be solved by just voting Democrat. I honestly don’t think it’s going to be solved at all. <br /><br />Humans are too preoccupied with themselves and what they want and what the political environment is to really truly care. We are self-destructive. I believe that it will get to the point where humankind is at risk for extinction due to Climate change before anyone takes any kind of genuine action. Most actions right now by the people who can enact this type of change are politically motivated and don’t have genuine support. And all of that aside, this requires the cooperation of the entire World. That means China would have to stop what they’re doing with their industrial ambitions. That means India has to progress drastically faster than they currently are. Look at the Middle East, they regressed in 50 years faster than they progressed to where they were in the 70s. I of course am referencing areas like Iran and Iraq, and not the entirety of the Middle East.<br /><br />Look at where America is now. We spent a long time trying to research renewable resources only to come up with virtually nothing, and coming up with technology that is actually worse for the environment. I will of course do everything that I can to support the environment of the planet because I do respect the earth and nature. However, it is naïve to believe that we are going to be able to make these changes that we drastically need to make while still being practical with the reality of the current time in order to prevent the catastrophic results that may result from continuing to behave the way that we are in regard to the climate. It’s like expecting world hunger to be solved. It’s never going to be solved. There always be groups of people who benefit from the starvation of massive amounts of people and thus True change can never really occur. This is also because people have the wrong idea about how to solve these issues. We just simply do not have the capacity or tools to prevent what will be the inevitable.

I’m<br /> tired of these self-righteous environmentalists, these white, bourgeois<br /> liberals who think the only thing wrong with this country is that there<br /> aren’t enough bicycle paths. People trying to make the world safe for <br />Volvos. Besides, environmentalists don’t give a shit about the planet. <br />Not in the abstract they don’t. You know what they’re interested in? A <br />clean place to live. Their own habitat. They’re worried that some day in<br /> the future they might be personally inconvenienced. Narrow, <br />unenlightened self-interest doesn’t impress me.<br /><br /> The planet has been through a lot worse than us. Been through <br />earthquakes, volcanoes, plate tectonics, continental drift, solar <br />flares, sun spots, magnetic storms, the magnetic reversal of the poles …<br /> hundreds of thousands of years of bombardment by comets and asteroids <br />and meteors, worldwide floods, tidal waves, worldwide fires, erosion, <br />cosmic rays, recurring ice ages … And we think some plastic bags and <br />some aluminum cans are going to make a difference?

An evolutionary cul-de-sac. <br />The planet’ll shake us off like a bad case of fleas.<br /><br />The planet will be here for a long, long, LONG time after we’re gone,<br /> and it will heal itself, it will cleanse itself, ’cause that’s what it <br />does. It’s a self-correcting system. The air and the water will recover,<br /> the earth will be renewed. And if it’s true that plastic is not <br />degradable, well, the planet will simply incorporate plastic into a new <br />paradigm: the earth plus plastic. The earth doesn’t share our prejudice <br />toward plastic. Plastic came out of the earth. The earth probably sees <br />plastic as just another one of its children. Could be the only reason <br />the earth allowed us to be spawned from it in the first place. It wanted<br /> plastic for itself. Didn’t know how to make it. Needed us.

The news at the time picked up on the handful of articles and kept repeating them which created a conflict that was previously never there. Than the lobbying kicked in. GOP which had at one point been on the side of climate change now took the position of lobbyists. Its also important to note that this is strictly an American problem. As no other consevative government in any other capitalist country questions climate science. So while you may have a strong desire to heap the blame on capitalisim to suit your chosen theological narrative. The truth is that this is more to do with specific systemic failures in the United States. Failures that could be corrected. From a common sense perspective it would be easier to fix the failures with regulation. Voting in left leaning canidates in 2020, 2022, 2024, 2026.

How long have they KNOWN what greenhouse gases would do to this planet? Because the oil industry has been sinking MILLIONS of dollars into utilizing the media and misleading studies to push back on any and all cultural impulses to address pollution for at *least* as long as I have been alive (4 decades of 'crazy hippie treehugger' stereotypes anybody?). They have lobbied the government -- same one you're depending on -- for *just* as long on top of that, in order to make absolutely *sure* that nothing changes. They are literally the reason why so many people are mislead on climate change data in the *first* place. They've had their chance to show that they are acting in good faith. They have FAILED. (If anything, democrats and liberal officials just got finished voting to fund *more* natural gas infrastructure, rather than the green tech that we *need*. 😒) Foolishness is believing that anything will get done while the oil industries and corporations are still pulling governmental strings. Foolishness is believing that a system that prioritizes corporate greed over human need could ever help us. Meanwhile, all the talent necessary to solve climate change is in the hands and minds of the workers. Instrument makers and scientists, construction workers, computer programmers, and conservationists, ALL could study and solve these issues much faster and easier if the pressures and misdirections put upon them by capitalist interests were removed. You must understand, the power and intelligence and skill needed to solve our problems and meet our goals doesn't dwell in the halls of Congress. It resides in the minds and hands of the workers. Organizing our communities and supporting our brightest in their important work will take effort....just as the recent *wave* of strikes, marches, protests, union building, and other initiatives have taken effort.

I think you would have a better chance herding cats. 50% of this country does not agree with the left that climate change is real. And only a portion of the left is onboard with becoming a socialist state. Maybe the tides will change on that though but will they change fast enough to matter. 13 to 14 years is what we have to stop the cycle from getting worse.

We've been trying it forever, yet the reigns are always held by capitalist interests, and capitalism will *always* prioritize profits over everything else -- even when the whole planet is at stake. Climate change IS global, but it's not the globe that is resisting the solution. Look into all the places America has warred and interfered with since WWII, and you'll notice a great many are places that have societies that have been *trying* to reorganize in *just* the way needed to bring about socialist and communist systems. And most of those countries fail, not because it can't work, but because our corporate controllers cannot *afford* for any examples of working socialist systems to exist. So we and NATO and the IMF do our worst to collapse it before it can begin. Our military does so much of the dirty work of disrupting global efforts to change economic systems, they force a leadership change, while our media dresses what they do as 'bringing them freedom'. Hell, it's happening right now. The media is doing its damnedest to convince the public that war with Venezuela is inevitable, all while the sanctions we and the West have put on them has ensured that their efforts to enact socialist policies are failing. That's why reorganization *has* to start here. Because a change in economic systems worldwide can't occur if we're always sabotaging it, and the only way to stop the sabotage is to wrest control from the oligarchy which depends on capitalism to keep them in power. (( Not to mention that many of the corporations that Natalie mentions, as well as one of the largest polluting militaries in the world, are based here in America. )) So we really need to get a move on. Even if, in a lot of ways, we've all been indoctrinated to eschew direct action, *direct action* is what works the most efficiently, even for the simplest things: https://youtu.be/1BMl6phxWpU",UCbt7-fRSu7pqdwo2wO86WXw,1,UgxvWZ0xVtxt4a6Szgx4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

And it definitely doesnt help solve the global issues. Climate change is a global issue. And Im afraid there is only so much we can do at a local level. A federal law to reduce emissions by 202X and a cash injection into research and development with academic and commercial institutions to find ways of researching this goal. Is going to do a lot more than the handful of communities across the nation willing to coalesce into a communal institution. It would also hopefully inspire other countries to take the lead and put us in direct competition with China to develop new tech in this space.

The rich get their power from our labor and from our cooperation in their system. So, *get to know your neighborhood*. Figure out what individual people's wants and needs are, and what problems the community has in common. Then, organize yourselves around those things; pooling your time, resources, and skill sets with others in the community.

For instance, the 2018-2019 winter ended early and had much less snow than even last year. The problem is Alaska relies on the snow for water such as refilling Eklutna lake, which is where Anchorage gets its water. Climate change is happening, but in my honest opinion, its too late.

Case in point, the FDA prevents anyone from marketing homeopathic and altruistic medicine under the guise that it's ""unsafe"". Who does that protect really? Answer: The pharmaceutical companies.

While caution is warranted in protecting human health the Act and Regulations are unsuitability for the modern World. This lack of timeliness has been highlighted by the Regulator itself pointing out the law being irrelevant to the modern world. Furthermore competing policy perspectives across jurisdictions, government and stakeholders and multiple committees resulting a mere deluge of recommendations that are rarely put to action. The law fails the environment, the economy and ultimately the Australian people. <br /> <br />Environmental imperative <br />The Act and Regulations are failing to protect the environment specifically as a result of prohibition of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). <br /> <br />Australia faces an unprecedented environmental challenge in the effects of global warming and accompanying extreme weather events. We are experiencing unprecedented drought, bush fires, calape of entire ecosystems (Darling River System and Great Barrier Reef), unprecedented melting of Artic and Antartic ice sheets (warmest winter temperatures in 115000 years). The ultimate extend of this greenhouse effect occurs on Earth’s nearest planetary neighbor Venus. On Venus a runaway greenhouse effect makes all life impossible and surface temperatures melt metals. We can only assume that we are headed this way. <br /> <br />The only proven way to reduce global warming is to improve photosynthesis. A Global cooling event occurred around 49 million years ago through more photosynthesis. Australia should allow improved photosynthesis which can be achieved through GMOs. GMOs should be used to reverse global warming an economic incentive to achieve this can be in built through crop production. <br /> <br />Economic imperative <br />Australia’s economy has traditionally been said to ‘ride on the sheep&#39;s back’ referring to the economy dependence that Australia has on the wool industry. In the 1960s this was disrupted through synthetic fibers such as nython and Australia suffered an economically crippling supply glut and falling export prices that lasted over twenty years. However a problem like this is a mere ripple compared to the tsunami of synthetic biology. Bolt threads (US) has sold spider silk beanies and risen $230 million in capital, and now acquired ‘best made’ retail company (they are gearing up for something big). They can mass produce spider silk through fiber proteins using GMOs and fermentation extraction. This process has the potential to also threaten the steel (spider silk is 5 times strong per density) and leather industries. <br /> <br />Action required: Reform the Act and Regulations to approve applications for GMOs on Environmental and Economic imperatives above unless overwhelming evidence to the contre.",UCb4ca_wYkpPyaBoor9IY8lA,0,UgynmfmJF9foD_ThrfF4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

Which is why I specifically did not write government in my previous comment and I do not think it is as relevant to the discussion tbh The problems between government and corporate is that corporations are and will be larger than any governments on earth right now. Unless the government itself IS a corporation but even the I'd hardly say Parliament is a contender to the behemoth that is for example Nestlē. And that is also the reason why most corporations get away with power that even governments can't force them to change. And keeping a revolving door on the democratically chosen leader for not being good enough doesn't actually fix the problem. Neither does legislation as we currently have no real way to actually enact any punishment for violation. I still think it is good that legislation exists as it seems to be doing something as opposed to what we see happens when they can just do whatever no holds barred. If there is to be a mobilisation for an uprising. The target has to be clear. And threat assessment is necessary. I do not think all governments or politicians being as they are; Avoidant and playing the field, Seemingly inactive and sprouting dissent and dissatisfaction...as they've literally always done. I do not see that as the threat. And my entire comment was to point out that: The powers responsible for the most heinous climate violations do not answer to anyone but themselves.

And scientists have known about it for all this time. Its not new.<br />-People that claim that releasing carbon into the atmosphere over many many decades doesn&#39;t actually change the greenhouse effect are as ignorant as people that claim that fairies are real and the earth is flat. No hate. Just sayin. PHYSICS, like thermodynamics, can&#39;t be argued with. But the actual effects of those physics on our way of life? That actually can be argued till the day the outcome happens. <br />-Al Gore is trying to get the public to change its ways all while getting MASSIVELY wealthy from the very thing he&#39;s supposedly fighting against.<br />-Al Gore is a hypocrite when his houses and private jet travel FAR eclipse ANY carbon emissions from ANY individual from the &quot;lower classes.&quot; Why can&#39;t he fly commercial? Even business class? Cause....well....EW! right?...rich people are assholes....<br />-We have NO idea what the REAL effect climate change will have over the next decades. We can make models. But factors unknown will come about. For example, what if additional rain makes plant life thrive opening new carbon sinks that would make our current models incorrect? what if new aquatic species form because of the salinity and ph changes which also become a stronger carbon sink than todays models predict? WE DON&#39;T KNOW what will happen. <br /><br />Anyway Natalie, great video as always. I wish I could side with liberals. I like liberals. They hate religion and I believe they honestly just want people to have good lives. I just can&#39;t. Liberals are wrong about so much. So are conservatives. But conservatives are correct about economics and that effects EVERYone. Keep your gay marriage, abortion, etc, and stop trying to change the capitalist economic system to a socialist/communist thing. That&#39;s all I want. The carbon tax thing will not end up a free trade thing if liberals have their way (visavie the &quot;new green deal&quot;). Make it a free trade thing, like a market where carbon credits are traded openly and transparently, I&#39;m fine with it like they did in Australia. But if liberals had their way, the government would simply tell the EPA to go close any company that is a &quot;polluter.&quot; Keep the government out of business. They shouldn&#39;t be doing anything but making rules everyone can live with and enforcing those rules. But climate change, at least right now, is an excuse to fuck people up, take yet MORE of our income, and that is not a good thing.",UC6hQIbzFPm5RBfsjm2pCGgA,0,Ugw6e8mYnyM_M4pTSRp4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

A year and a half later came Al Gore&#39;s &quot;An Inconvenient Truth&quot; (2006). Both are fiction although Crichton makes no claim otherwise. He does, however, list some data that Gore would likely find inconvenient. Personally I think that mankind has little to do with the climate, and can do very little about it. More CO2 will contribute to more plant growth and if more trees were planted, more oxygen would result. No mention is made in IPCC regarding the role the Earth&#39;s orbit and axial tilt play in how much sunlight reaches the northern and southern hemispheres. It only notes that the amount of sunlight reaching Earth is constant. However due to the axial tilt, the light that reaches the northern (and southern) halves varies as the earth orbits the sun. And the orbital path varies in in the shape of the ellipse it describes, from more circular to lengthier. I find this argument more compelling than blaming CO2 as a greenhouse gas monster. Water vapor has the most significant greenhouse effect. Just FYI.<br />Aside from that I really enjoy your videos.

Because there is a mentality that exists for, I would guess, a LOT of Americans that if you are rich, you can avoid being affected. That if you are rich, you can avoid the consequences of your actions.<br /><br />And it&#39;s no wonder people have this mentality, we CONSTANTLY see rich people not held accountable for their actions or not being punished to near the same extent as less wealthy people who commit much smaller crimes. I honestly believe that changing this mentality by making sure that rich people are as accountable for their responsibility will go a long way to making people care more about long term consequences of short term actions.<br /><br />Personally, and this may seem ridiculous to a lot of you, I see this disregard of consequences is in the video game industry. Shareholders of video game companies are more than likely not interested in the industry, so the short term profit that leads to the destruction of the industry in the long term is of no importance to them because they do not participate in the industry, they only make money off of it.

Purw Capitalism is a garbage system based on crass, momentary self interest and appeals to the outdated ""tribal caveman"" mentality left over from our bronze age ancestors where having ""more,more,more"" meant impowerment and survival for fledgling civilzations and being lead by ""Chieftains"" helped keep the more vulnerable and simpleminded members of the tribe safely unified, so said Chiefs or Elders were lavished with more resources due to the burden of being soul decision makers and coordinators i.e. Fascism out of primal neccessity. Our culture now, figuritivity and literally, has far more educational and technological resources, reaching a greater span enlightenment, so the ""Chieftains"", who lived in relative splendor in comparison to the tribe, are clearly becoming out moded.

You can't just leave one polluted town. Because the surrounding towns water supply is also affected. Many places get ground water from one big shared source that is connected underground. Many places in the US are like this. Take where I live for example. Our groundwater is shared from the same connected source with three states. That water gets contaminated at one point, it's all contaminated. It wouldn't be restricted to just one town. When soil is polluted, it rains. The water carries contaminates into streams, creeks, and rivers and right out to the ocean. Pollution rarely just stays in one spot. Wind blows contaminated soil all over the place.

You can't. You also haven't given me anything but links to a website that does in fact state that ocean levels are rising due to climate change made much faster by man.

Show me your scientific data that says these heavy metals and chemical pesticides, herbicides, and fungicides and all the other numerous chemicals we put and breathe into our bodies every day is completely healthy and having high levels of toxins is harmless. They are called toxins by the medical community for a reason you know? Partly because they are toxic and do nothing for our bodies except harm. Yes, you fell back on some vitamins are toxic if you overdose. That's so weak. Lol. Weak. You can drink too much water. That doesn't mean you stop drinking water. Because water has a vital function in your body, just like that vitamin, just not in excess. Toxins are toxins because their only function in your body is to be toxic and cause harm.

The zooanthellae expelled by DYING corals is not really alive. It is damaged, degraded and partially digested before it is expelled. It can't do anything at that point. The zooanthellae has a symbiotic relationship with coral and during thermal stress is basically cooked. Normally coral constantly digests the older degraded zooanthellae. Under thermal stress? The zooanthellae dies within the coral and is expelled at a higher rate than it can replicate itself sometimes even before being digested because too much dead zooanthellae in a coral can kill a coral if it builds up. However the coral cannot live without the zooanthellae. So most corals do not survive the bleaching incident without severe babying. Which doesn't happen in the wild. Also, some corals don't even die of slow starvation due to losing their food source from expelling baked zooanthellae. Some corals are just temperature sensitive and died immediately instead of from bleaching. In 2016 30% of the coral in the great barrier reef was killed. The coral that survived was tougher than the coral immediately lost. In 2017 another 20% of the tougher survivors was lost. So last I checked the great barrier reef is half dead. In the past heatwaves like that happened on average around every 26 years. Since the 80s they've been hitting on average around every six years. The great barrier reef in particular was hit two years in a row. It takes ten years for a reef to recover from one bleaching incident. Because the ocean has heatwaves! Imagine that! Science! These heatwaves have increased by 54% and last for 17% longer and are coming more frequently. Closer together, not allowing reefs and corals to recouperate. Which is why they are now killing corals. Even in Florida, down in the keys, coral is being wiped out. There are scientists right now down there trying to toughen up corals in a lab. By taking lots of coral frags and subjecting them to the same more acidic pH and higher temps that come with heat waves and then the ones that survive are being put back out in the wild. Trying to increase natural selection for tougher corals to save the reef. The warmer waters have also increased disease in corals which they are trying to combat with medicated paste. Coral diversity has DROPPED. Some corals are able to adapt. Many are not. Some are already gone from the wild for good. So with the corals that do survive we are losing diversity in our reefs. Losing diversity is a bad thing. Hopefully we can manage to retain some of what remains. But doubtful. Also here is a link that noaa actually linked on their website where they talk about climate affecting sea levels, show their own measurements and the upward trend. They give this for extra information on the rising sea levels. https://science2017.globalchange.gov/chapter/12/ A three inch raise in ocean levels since 1993 really sucks for a town like Miami which was already at sea level before it went up.",UCyVI-csonnMRCgxNq1OI5bA,1,UgwKj1_N_ZVjr8Jr7xd4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

You've listened to green groups but know ZERO about the science. And that's really ironic because you ramble on with a wall of text showing nothing but blatant ignorance of the material. Here's a sample of what the tide gages record on sea level https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/sltrends_station.shtml?id=8518750 Feel free to click the little arrows on this map and select ""linear trend"" to see the data from each gage with a linear trend line on top of it for comparison https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/sltrends.html Go find some meaningful acceleration at any gage with a reasonably long record. Now coral. The corals ARE NOT dying off. Second of all ""bleaching"" is not coral dying. In most cases of a bleaching incident (which is them expelling their algae to find another species better suited to current temperatures) they find another species and continue on as they have for millions of years. The oceans ARE NOT OVERHEATING. If you'll do the math you will find that the suggested (but never confirmed) energy imbalance caused by GHG forcing and various other factors would take 500 years to raise the temperatures of the oceans by even 1C. For the purpose of this discussion they might just as well be bottomless pit of thermal storage. What DOES cause the algae to bleach sometimes temperature-wise is plain old weather. Yes, the oceans have weather too. Indeed they also have well documented long term warm/cool phases that take most of a human lifetime to cycle ONCE. You should look into them, MOST of what you consider ""climate change"" is just an impact of these long term cycles (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation...along with others and various gyres and atmospheric phenomenon) ALSO...corals are already LIMITED by the rate of sea level rise. They can't go higher because when they do they're exposed and the tips are broken off by violent wave action...which is part of the process by which coral atolls are formed. Coral atolls effectively ""float"", broken coral piled so it only just breaks the surface. Too high and it erodes away, too shallow and the waves pile it up again as the coral grows (seriously, do your research) Nothing you've said is of any substance. Its just hear-say. You've never looked into the relevant information. You've never bothered to truly fact check...you just look at those that give you bullet points that agree with your ideology.

Their support of opposition to this global warming nonsense is insignificant. It is not attitudes like mine, where I spend a decade pouring over the actual data and research of something supposedly important to society that is the problem. Its attitudes like yours where you go ""OMG, Miami is having to prepare!"" when you know no such thing. Here's the closest tide gage with a long term history. https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/sltrends_station.shtml?id=8724580 Shouldn't they have gotten off their posteriors a century ago? We could probably talk all day and you not manage to get anything right in a meaningful way. You know nothing of the material.

An adaptation fish species undergo to live in warmer waters is... The smaller survive. Which leads to smaller fish of the same species in warmer water than the same fish in cooler water. Because the bigger the fish the more oxygen needed and the warmer the water the less oxygen available. Which eventually means less fish viable as a food source for humans. Not that we should be eating fish anyway. They've been too polluted in the ocean and in fresh water for a long time. For example, near me a coal power plant is responsible for the mercury in a black water river system. Mercury is more easily absorbed by wildlife in the very low pH of blackwater and means the fish are more toxic. Clean burning coal. Biggest lie ever told. There is a warning on eating fish from water systems near coal plants. Because it's dangerous. We won't have to wait on the earth to heat to the point of baking species away if we just poison our food supply and water supply to the point we can't eat or drink anything. Guess what's messed up?

Plus the fact that idiots who don't care will continue to do what they do instead of even entertain alternatives because the oil industry paid your Gods, *cough*, I mean politicians to tell you what to think. I keep fish tanks as a hobby. Many corals have specific temperature, light and water quality needs. Our oceans are already heating to the point many corals are dying off. The water gets deeper they don't get enough light. The atmosphere gets warmer, they get bleached. Pollution increases, water quality kills them. There are fish and other creatures that live in specific ranges too and have a relationship to the corals that are dying. There are many symbiotic relationships in the ocean. One thing dies out and could cause a small chain effect. There are already effects on fish in the great lakes. Did you know the warmer the water the less dissolved oxygen for larger fish to be able to breathe? The lakes have been warming since the 80s. Some fish are now only spawning on the Canadian side because their reproduction requires a certain water temperature at a certain time of year and the southern parts of the lakes are too warm. The effects have not bothered us as of yet but they are certainly bothering other species on this planet already. There is plenty of actual scientific proof that any idiot could see with their own eyes. No degree necessary to observe nature. But things won't change. Because of attitudes like yours. ""IT'S NOT BOTHERING ME SO EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE."" Until it's not. To understand how small temperature changes can effect the world so greatly, I guess you would have to have an elementary grasp of life science. Like life cycles. That certain species take their cue to mate, migrate, and a multitude of other life functions based on the time of year and temperature and variations cause drops in the population. How if one food source in a food web disappears the entire web is effected. Sometimes animals can adapt. Sometimes they cannot. I suppose you assume every living thing will be able to evolve and not die out then? Because that doesn't happen. Evolution requires an advantageous genetic mutation to appear. Sometimes that happens. Sometime it doesn't. There are cities in this country having to prepare for issues. Like Miami. They will be facing losing part of their city. Just because it's not affecting you doesn't mean everything is fine and dandy. I never said it was going to happen now or tomorrow, simply that we have passed the point of no return to save our glaciers based on attitudes like yours that people have held for decades despite knowing the risks. Eventually, it will affect us. Delicate species will disappear and it will most certainly effect all species connected to them. Just saying, humans are connected to a lot of the species on this planet. Pollution is cumulative. If you take a petri dish and put a bacteria in it and give them all the food and water and oxygen they need. They will happily produce and produce and produce in their closed system. You keep feeding them. They keep multiplying and making waste. Then one day they die off. Why? They had everything they needed. They drowned in their own waste. That's what we're headed towards. The earth is a closed system like that petri dish. It's just much larger and it's going to take longer. As of right now we are using more resources in a year than the earth can produce and thus we are making more waste than the earth can naturally handle. We're overloading the system.

It does not need to be something bad."" Well, how do you define ""weird""? How can you think this sentence ends the debate? People are arguing that the weirdness you see in some things comes from social prejudices that you picked up from the society and social groups you grew up in. That's actually the point. If you look at it from a distance, your argument seems like the one of an 8-year old, no offense intended. ""I can see how you could think that it ""negatively influences society"". I've heard that before. IU do not share that opinion though. I actually find it disrespectful towards people. It assumes they are not able to take a joke as what it is."" Well the thing is, social sciences argue that there is a global trend (the sum of all arguments and jokes and whatnot does not have a perfect balance ""in the middle"") and that this trend is partly inherited from the views of the previous generations and reinforced by the sum of many such jokes and small sayings and opinions that shape our view of the world. So it's not so much South Park by itself than the trend it's been following, among many other things. If people hear jokes about how jews are only into money, all the time, they start laughing about it but end up buying into it. Because that's how we work, as a social group. That kind of behaviour has been studied for decades. It's starting to sound as a kind of blindness to keep on pushing the ""people have complete free will, they can't be influenced, and I refuse to accept that a social phenomenon can exist beyond the individual scale"". Of course, it doesn't mean people are robotic morons with 0 will either. We're stuck somewhere in the middle. But it's tiring to see people using those old tired arguments of ""heyyyyy we can tell when it's a joke y'know"" when humour has been used for so long to pass prejudices as something harmless.",UCRp8xtmh1ipeh9f2EazmVLw,1,UgzmAhm-jYnigItPTKl4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

I sometimes watch different points of view, but there&#39;s always a guy that has a counter argument. What I would like the most is to have a lot of debates about it between knowledgeable people, so I can see them better resolve the arguments. I&#39;ve tried looking for debates but they are scarce, and the few there are, usually the person who fully supports the climate change stance is less articulated, and frankly has worse arguments.<br /><br />Still, from what I&#39;ve gathered, it seems that there is such a thing as climate change, and at least a portion of it is caused by humanity. How much climate change? not sure. How much a portion is caused by humanity? not sure.<br /><br />And above all else, what the fuck do we do about it? When it comes to actual policies and measures, there are some reasonable arguments that what we have to do is A LOT, so much, that all treaties about it do essentially nothing even if followed. At least today, it seems we can&#39;t support anything close to a modern way of life without fosil fuels, that wouldn&#39;t cost a whole lot more with other energy sources.<br /><br />I&#39;m all for trying to solve problems, but suggesting stuff that doesn&#39;t do anything just because we want to feel good about ourselves doesn&#39;t seem a good plan to me. There&#39;s probably a lot of things we can do, that collectively contribute almost nothing. I want to know what are the things we can do that do make a difference, that can actually reduce or stop the problem in a significant amount.<br /><br />I heard an economist say that the best we can do for climate change is invest in research for alternative energy sources, so they can become viable mainstream.

There is a reason why many people are lactose intolerant. But again I will say, everyone needs to come to their own reason as to why they stop eating meat. If not, it will be a short, inconsistant diet. So decide to become vegan or vegetarian based on an informed and individualistic belief.

Entire forests explode into flame in those conditions. Climate change is real. How we respond will decide the future. An elitist response of austerity with green characteristics will further immiserate working people and incense them against climate action, as we see with the Yellow Vests in France. It will take a ton of economic growth and a ton of mining along zero carbon lines to eliminate fossil fuels. How we marshal our resources will open some options and close off others. What concerns me is the Naomi Kleins of the world inveighing against mining or against vertical integration and nationalisation of energy systems, instead pushing for a small is beautiful aesthetic with local production and consumption. But if everyone only does a small bit, we'll only achieve a small bit. And the romanticism of atomised communities to deal with a global problem requiring global coordination is conservatism with green aesthetics.

But doing so would make the thread make no sense to those that follow after. I still stand my my position however, that a better politics of environment needs to be constructed by the left. It cannot build on Lovins, Heidegger, Ehrlich, not even Rachel Carson or Martin Heidegger. The wellspring from which those thinkers drink is poison, and even more perniciously, some elements of the environmentalist left have taken up those ideas without critical analysis, spinning them with the language of socialist anticapitalism but situating the problem in individuals like any other neoliberal. I would even argue that Contrapoints falls into this trap with this video, situating climate inaction within the individual critique of certain powerful people being climate deniers. Whereas the situation is far more structural than individual. We get clothing, medicines, shelter, mobility, communication and even food from fossil fuels. Moving away from that will require a fundamental structural change and the adoption of a different energy source, while requiring planning on a scale that would substantially repudiate market relations. But not only that, we have 20 years to replace our food, industry and transport system built up over 200 years within 30 years. Which is why the individual critique of climate denial is so self destructive, and so rooted in reaction as opposed to looking forward and beyond powerful interests and working towards agricultural and industrial policy that renews and replaces the old infrastructure with stuff that does not kill 3 million people yearly from outdoor air pollution even if everything proceeds correctly. When Thatcher and Reagan instituted their revolution from above and disempowered the working class, they did so with a clear eyed view to overturn the system itself. It is well past time for the left to do the same.",UCUjmCjYul-xC-TplX2mkwJQ,1,Ugxe30iZspBX-M8YuuR4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

I laid out the historical origins of such anti-humanism and the dire consequences it had in perpetuating racism and mass murder, and later, mass sterilisation by Ehrlich and company. And I am not exaggerating about Heidegger being a Nazi. Just because he is widely read by students of philosophy who then go on to take up ""leftist values"" does not rehabilitate Heidegger nor the ideas he espouses. Such anti-humanism has no place on the left, which has been steeped in the values of liberation of humans from oppression since its split from ""traditional"" liberalism. The emergence of anti-humanism amongst environmentalists, given their elite and conservative origins, is not so surprising.

I accused you of shooting from the hip earlier, because you quipped by accusing me of being a ""denialist daddy"". And while I have been called worse, and I don't mind it per se, I do think it is a pretty bad misreading of what I was standing for in previous replies: for the purging of anti-humanism from the left. I was also for the re-engagement of the left in grappling with the question and the goals surrounding the use of state power to densify, develop, decarbonise and to look forward philosophically, instead of imagining a lost, glorious past looking backward to an Arcadian idyll of ""unspoilt nature"". I would like to think, that calling for a return of the ideas of plenty for all, and engaging with climate change with the viewpoint of struggling for a better future without lapsing into pessimism, would not be controversial. But maybe it is. If the rise of Buchanan's ideas that monopoly is to be embraced under neoliberal capitalism on the side of the conservatives, perhaps anti-human eco-austerity is the green left equivalent of neoliberal capitalist realism.",UCUjmCjYul-xC-TplX2mkwJQ,1,Ugxe30iZspBX-M8YuuR4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

To attribute climate change to human _existence_ as opposed to the use of _energy and land_ is to invite fundamentally reactionary, misanthropic politics that serve no benefit except to that of the ruling elite. If humans are the problem, then climate change does not matter: let climate change destroy civilisation and humans are wiped out. The earth will still exist, as would non-human life. From that accelerationist, misanthropic perspective, nothing we do matters. Climate action _matters_ because humans _matter._ We would like to preserve human civilisation and flourishing and right now, fossil fuel combustion and land clearing threatens that. So to call humans ""cancer"" or to declare ""overpopulation"" as a problem in the context of a climate crisis is a self-contradicting stance. Climate change does not matter if you don't care about humans, but if you do care about climate change, then the politics you hold _cannot_ be misanthropic. A better politics to be constructed around climate change _must_ be in the context of maximising human flourishing while solving it. All of Javier's appeals to ""biology"" and other posts pointing out that 1 degree is a ""fever"" do not lead to a solution - rather, they see humans as a _problem._ The solution to climate change is, thankfully, relatively straightforward in engineering terms. Fundamentally, the roadblocks lie within neoliberalism that sees financialisation and marketisation as a solution to everything. A new base of power is necessary that sees the state and state finance of huge infrastructure projects like widespread fast railways, densification of housing as well as a massive expansion of social housing, as well as re-nationalisation of power infrastructure and land development will be necessary.

But that was not the point that nihilists that Javier and others were making. We can make a zero emissions world, economy and still have excess energy to make all countries into well developed, industrialised countries. To do so will require a global effort transcending borders and generations. This effort is _not_ helped by New Age, Malthusian eco-fascism that sees humanity as a parasite and that only a return to a more idyllic, ""natural"" way of living is the solution. https://www.scribd.com/document/356604445/Organic-Farming-in-Nazi-Germany-Biodynamics We know that organic farming has a 30% yield penalty to conventional farming and so land use change emissions outweigh the biodiversity benefits. So we should work to make conventional farming better (ideally, move it under greenhouses to minimise land use and maximise yields). That takes a lot of energy, if nothing else than for the iron and glass. https://phys.org/news/2018-09-high-yield-farming-environment-previously-thoughtand.html We know that wind and solar effectively entrench natural gas power generators because their seasonal and daily variability calls for extremely fast ramp rates that exceed steam-cycle turbines. And that batteries are too high-emission, too short-lived, too materials intensive for use in all but boutique applications like electric cars. So we should be instigating a Messmer Plan style global nuclear power plant buildout to rapidly take coal power plants off the grid, using batteries for FCAS services and building wind and solar up to the capacity factors and no further. https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ente.201600622 http://environmentalprogress.org/big-news/2017/2/11/german-electricity-was-nearly-10-times-dirtier-than-frances-in-2016 https://reneweconomy.com.au/tesla-big-battery-earns-another-4m-from-fcas-in-fourth-quarter-65127/ https://www.vox.com/2015/6/24/8837293/economic-limitations-wind-solar The idea that we should return to living more ""naturally"" off of the land, with ""less intensive"" agricultural practices or reverting to hunter-gathering in some kind of neo-primitivist fantasy of the noble savage is fraught in more ways than one. For one it would mean a massive expansion of human exploitation of the land. Organic farming has a 30% yield penalty and this is _after_ the intensity benefits of mechanisation and nitrogen laundering. Pre-industrial farming practices would devastate the land to the point that land use emissions would tip us over into a post 3 degree scenario. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222572440_Preindustrial_agriculture_versus_organic_agriculture_The_land_cost_of_sustainability https://news.mongabay.com/2012/07/pre-industrial-deforestation-still-warming-atmosphere/ That we should source ""natural"" energy from the wind and the sun elides the fact that wind turbine and solar panel production is a _globalised_ supply chain. You have rare earth mining in Baotou, Mongolia. Silver ore, haematite and bauxite from Australia. Cement from China (where do you think the coal ash in concrete comes from?). Polysilicon in Germany and China. Power electronics from various suppliers in the EU. Oil, lubricants, waxes and plastics from refineries in the Middle East and BASF in Germany. And of course, cargo ships made in Korean shipyards with diesel engines from Finland's Wartsila to bring all those raw materials, refined commodities and finished products to the end user. How in the _world_ is that more natural, more sustainable, and any less alienated than the society you live in today? If anything, renewable energy is _more_ corporatised, _more_ commercial, _more_ competitive and so globalised that ""local"" power is laughable. A _nuclear power plant_ 30 kilometers away built with local unionised labour and staffed by university graduates from the state university would be more ""local"" and ""community based"" than any solar panel deriving its provenance from a dozen countries. If there is to be a return to some ""natural"" idyll, it does _not_ begin with renewable energy and a de-intensification of agriculture, that is for sure.

First, you need to go back to the drawing board and learn what existential nihilism and moral nihilism are. Existential nihilism is a philosophy that states that, because we are nothing more than the result of a series of physical and chemical processes in an unfeeling, unthinking universe, there is no ultimate purpose for our existence. We simply are. Purpose is just a concept that humans come up with to give our short existence on this planet some internal meaning. We know that we will someday die. We know that our entire species will someday die. We know that the universe will someday die. But we've given ourselves the purpose of living, spreading, and trying to enjoy the time that we have. That's existential nihilism in a nutshell. Existential nihilists still believe that humans have a purpose, they just understand that such purpose is not intrinsic to the universe or some ""grand plan."" Instead, purpose is something that is decided by our personal preference (one can decide that their purpose is to be a skilled baker, a helpful cop, a loving parent, etc). Moral nihilism follows this and says that there is also no inherent morality. Again, we just are. There is no cosmic force that has determined that it is bad to steal or harm others. It is up to individuals and societies to decide what they want to do, how they want to treat each other, what their societal goals will be, etc. People who accept the philosophy of moral nihilism are still moral people, they just don't delude themselves into thinking that there is an inherent morality. We start with a basic assumption, like ""I want to live in a healthy society where I can be safe and happy, and everyone else seems to want the same thing, so that should be our goal."" We realize that there are certain things that add to and take away from human well-being and happiness, and we make it our goal to be a net benefit to human happiness by analyzing the actions that can take us in a desired direction. It's generally pretty easy and you do it every day. There isn't a god telling you what is right or wrong. That's your own human brain working out that problem on its own.

Am I straw manning that argument? Human development has allowed us to live longer, live healthier, travel further, while using less land area to support doing so. The paleolithic human required tens of square kilometers of hunting and gathering ground to support a subsistence diet. Many died before the age of thirty from disease, predation and internecine warfare. Securing territory is securing food. The early agricultural human required a few square kilometers of farming land. Irrigation, fertilisation and crop rotation, animal husbandry and selective plant breeding would push productivity up to the point that a homestead could provide for itself over a few hectares. The early industrial human only required a few hectares. Thousands were freed of countryside toil and sought work in towns and cities as productivity grew to the point that you did not need large families with several sons and daughters to tend the homestead. Electrification introduced refrigeration in turn and massively reduced food waste and increased food safety. Cities grew accordingly as less land area was needed to feed larger populations living longer. The Borlaug revolution boosted agricultural yields to the point that now even developing countries like India and China would no longer be dependant upon food importation while again, reducing land area. Competition over land, and thus wars, reduced accordingly. At every stage, land use per human has reduced. Wars have reduced in frequency as now most countries besides ones still reliant on subsistence farming can now support themselves. This is not a ""cancer"", this is human flourishing. And it should be noted, that it is the late industrial humans that have been _able_ to become environmentally conscious in the first place. When you are not starving or threatened by war or rape you can begin to care about maintaining your surroundings. The hunter gatherer could not give a shit about the sanctity of their environment because _it was trying to kill them._ It is only after Borlaug shattered Ehrlich's dire pronouncements, that organisations like the Environmental Protection Authority and other government run conservation and pollution reduction programs could spring up and be successful. Before that, nations were trying to survive in the face of warfare and before that, nations were starving due to diseases like potato blight. What I am trying to say, therefore, is that the only reason Javier can have the thoughts he has, is due to the triumph of agricultural yields over Malthus. If he considers humans a cancer, which is a nihilistic view, he should start by defining _who_ is the cancer. But if he does that, he is a racist. If he means that the whole of the human race is cancer, he is left with killing himself, or killing as many others as he can to stave it off. Apoptosis. In either case, he becomes a psychopath.

It was the Nazis, cribbing off of American practices in the early 20th century that ""scientised"" racism and grew the eugenics movement, that coined the term ""untermensch"". Lesser humans, unfit to live. These unsavoury narratives were carried forward into the late 20th century by the likes of Paul Ehrlich who authored ""The Population Bomb"". Positing that population growth and growing human life expectancy would overtake agricultural productivity. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Population_Bomb Note the similarities in Ehrlich's thought progression to the Nazi programs of forced sterilisation, to forcing countries that would otherwise receive food aid to undertake programs of population control. Ehrlich himself led a pogrom of forced sterilisation to India where the untermensch in his view would be prevented from procreating so that the well-travelled, well-fed rich white dude that he was, could continue to enjoy the comforts of civilisation. If you consider yourself a progressive, and not some closet Malthusian, then you would be all for the maximisation of human flourishing. We know, from current statistical data, that as countries develop and increase in energy use, and urbanise and industrialise, that population growth peaks and then declines: https://ourworldindata.org/. India, Ehrlich's nemesis, has already experienced population growth stagnation. As has China. And Africa's many countries are soon to follow as they develop too. The idea that humans would grow, without thought, beyond control of the host, to the point of overwhelming the ecosystem is a fundamentally racist one. Ehrlich was proved wrong, by the way. Agricultural yields have been slowly increasing to the point at which now we _can_ feed everyone. The problem is not productivity but of distribution. Food distribution networks in poor countries are notoriously atrocious with non-existent roads, scattered population, and under-developed production infrastructure like subsistence farming that is vulnerable to being wiped out by a poor harvesting season or disease. So Ehrlich is wrong. The eugenics movement, which had as its raison d'etre the suppression of ""undesirable"" human growth, is wrong.

I say climatic structures, because it is very possible that we are seeing a fractured climate compare to the normal, with warmer arctic areas, and relatively unchanged tropics (which is what is currently happening) with very different weather, but rather similar climate (ie, big, stronger tropical storms, but generally similar tropical temperatures). For instance, Siberia, prior, and in some areas even during the last ice age, contained massive prairies, and sustained ecologies strong enough to feed herds of mastodons. Is that good? Bad? For who? How? Also we rarely take in account the role of the Sun in our climate. Many scientists are claiming that a future cool down of the Sun (temporarily) is coming, per its own &quot;weather&quot; cycles, which will significantly affect the amount of heat which reaches our planet in the first place.

2159,Ugz716hqpeniWE5RTMF4AaABAg,0.0,1,2019-01-04 15:06:33,The Jolly Sloth,"So we went from the &quot;Greenhouse effect&quot;, to &quot;Global Warming&quot;, to &quot;Climate Change&quot;, all in the space of 30 years. Every single climate science prediction has been incorrect on a grand scale. <br />I remember learning about the &quot;Greenhouse Effect&quot; at school, when I was 10 years old. My teacher told me that scientists has proven that by the year 2010 the earth would have warmed by 5 degrees. Utter nonsense, as it turned out. <br />I am not claiming that humans have no affect on the warming of the planet, I believe we do. I simply don&#39;t believe we are to blame for the whole lot. <br />If you look at the worst offenders, China, the USA, India, and Russia are disaster zones. The country I lie has very low carbon emissions, and I will not take on collective guilt for what a minority of countries are doing to the planet, when I have nothing to do with these countries. <br />Instead of putting a blanket carbon tax on everyone, we should consider that cattle produce a huge amount of Co2, and if we all went meat free it would have the most positive effect on the planet. <br />Also taxing gas guzzling 4x4&#39;s like Jeeps and Land Rovers should be a priority. People should be driving small, semi electric cars unless they can prove they need the vehicle for their business, or they have more than 3 children in their family under the age of 18. <br />For those who want to drive around in a huge 4x4 Land Rover or similar with only one person in the vehicle, new laws should be made taxing the hell out of them. People need to be more responsible in their choice of vehicle. <br />These two measures would make a massive difference to the planet. Knowing that 2/3rds of the non-ice covered land mass of the planet is used for animal agriculture (and food in general) is disgusting! <br />On the same amount of land it takes to &quot;grow&quot; 1 kilogram of beef you can grow 100 kilos of potatoes or tomatoes, and use FAR less water. We also would save energy and land growing all the grain that the animal agriculture industry needs to feed the cattle. <br />This land could then be used for growing non-meat products, and we would have about half of the land left over for green energy usage like wind turbines, solar panels and other (hopefully better) forms of green energy. I believe nuclear energy is a much better option than crude oil and coal. We should be spending money on developing Thorium nuclear reactors because the current &quot;green energy&quot; options are simply not good enough to sustain us as a species. <br />Carbon taxes just hurt the poor though, and are a terrible idea. Tax private jets. Tax 4x4 vanity vehicles, tax luxury products which use a lot of energy to make, and start finding alternatives to fossil fuel based plastics (like hemp plastics which bio-degrade). <br />Also, stop blaming the everyday person. Blame the governments in conjunction with multi-nationals who don&#39;t give a rats ass about the planet, as long as they can make some short term cash.",UCpBvyb2iHBLjdVXUKX8j0hw,0,Ugz716hqpeniWE5RTMF4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

It's quite easy to fall into the trap of eating just 2 or 3 meals over and over again because you can't be bothered to think up more during day to day chaos which obviously isn't at all healthy but also saps any enthusiasm for veganism REALLY quickly.

Drinking straws are an accessibility measure, necessary for people who have defects that prevent them from drinking directly from a glass or people like me with overly sensitive teeth. The amount of plastic waste produced by drinking straws in negligible. Meanwhile I can&#39;t even buy the simplest of products at the store without it containing massive amounts of plastic packaging in addition to all the plastic grocery bags. The burden of fixing these problems can&#39;t be on us because we are left with few to no options. We can attempt to be conscientious with our purchases and bring reusable bags to the store, but more often than not we simply have no option but to either get the products we need and increase plastic waste or go without. The burden must instead be placed on these companies producing these products to choose different materials without increasing the price point for us. And yet despite all of this, a pointless band-aid fix of banning straws just punishes the consumer and disabled people. The system is broken from top to bottom because in order to do the change in materials like I said, it would increase manufacturing cost. I say don&#39;t push that expense on the consumer, so the companies will take it out on employees. Meanwhile, the owners and CEOs won&#39;t see a single change in their salaries. It&#39;s all bad. Revolution at this point really is the only option. Revolution over straws, yes, I really did get to here from straws.

You might occasionally be in a situation that required you to use a plastic one (left the house with no bag, no clean ones in your car) but even just eliminating 80% of plastic straw use would be a good thing. You're likely going to run your dishwasher anyways and straws take basically no space. You can get a set of 8 reusables for the price of two packages of plastic straws and they'll easily outlast the plastic ones. People drive me nuts with batteries, too. Alkaline batteries are basically completely obsoleted by nickel metal hydride batteries which last longer per charge and can be charged maybe even 100 times. I did the math; the NiMH batteries cost more plus the charger. I, personally, will break even after 12ish years but I don't use very many batteries (I started about 5 years ago). The faster you go through batteries, the faster you will catch up to and surpass the savings on alkaline batteries... so you save money to use better batteries that last four times as long AND don't dump a bunch of batteries into a landfill. According to my energy company, I average just over half the electricity use of my neighbors. Now, I'm single and many of them are couples or families, so there is that. The number one energy culprit is A/C use, though, which isn't impacted by number of residents in a given apartment. You're either running it or not. I make sure to shut mine off every single time I leave for work. Yea, it is marginally uncomfortable to return from work on a hot day but the unit cools my apartment within an hour. A lot of these things are easy to do. I know I probably sound preachy and I am far from the perfect little tree hugger (I take long showers and eat plenty of meat) but if each person does a few small things it would help the climate (and save them money). I agree 100% on one-time throw away plastic packaging. In most cases, paper or cardboard would work just fine (or even biodegradable materials).",UCMoQL0LAFZqmGUD4DpxXcgQ,1,UgzGG8D2bct4OzsmwtF4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

Less people die in modern times, yet due to inflation, that dollar amount of damages will *always* be larger and larger. Why report it that way? Ratings, which equals ad revenue. It's insurance profits. A global economy has a massive environmental overhead. Reverting to a simple, minimalistic lifestyle immediately changes that. Anyways, the thinking that ""I'm dying because of how other people are behaving"" is a direct result of not living the life you'd like to. And that is totally understandable. Very few teach how to lead a fulfilling life. Look up *Jim Rohn*. His seminars used to cost a weeks pay. All of them are available free right here on Youtube. I promise you this, start living a life *you* design, and other peoples seemingly negative behavior will cease to be a problem. One of Rohn's greatest lines is *If you will change, everything will change for you*. Look at it this way. Has government solved world hunger? Murder? Drug addiction?

2371,Ugzm-fQazVZK5qo7Kkl4AaABAg,0.0,0,2018-12-27 15:40:55,Colin Campbell,"&quot;To name Gaia – that is to say, to associate an assemblage of material processes that demand neither to be protected nor to be loved, and which cannot be moved by the public manifestation of our remorse, with the intrusion of a form of transcendence into our history – ought not especially to shock most scientists. They themselves are in the habit of giving names to what they recognize has the power to make them think and imagine – and this is the very sense of the transcendence that I associate with Gaia. Those who have set up camp in the position of the guardians of reason and progress will certainly scream about irrationality. They will denounce a panicky regression that would make us forget the “heritage of the Enlightenment,” the grand narrative of human emancipation shaking off the yoke of transcendences. Their role has already been assigned. After having contributed to skepticism with regard to climate change, they will devote all their energy to reminding an always credulous public opinion that it must not be diverted, that it must believe in the destiny of Man and in his capacity to triumph in the face of every challenge. Concretely, this signifes the duty to believe in science, the brains of humanity, and in technology, in the service of progress. Provoking their yelling is something that neither amuses nor scares me.&quot;<br />-Isabelle Stengers",UCx0zBogSCcaKvHO6CyMPQUw,0,Ugzm-fQazVZK5qo7Kkl4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

The problem, just as much as the specific 100 companies, is capitalism&#39;s systemic antagonistic outlook on nature. If we want to solve this problem, we can&#39;t just craft a bipartisan bridge by using their own rhetoric, because that exact outlook is how we got here; we need to fundamentally change our cultural outlook on nature to one of mutualistic synergy instead of exploitation and domination. Yeah, sounds vague and abstract as fuck, but there are projects to do exactly that in (oh man, Appeal to Rojava should be documented as a leftist informal fallacy) Rojava (Make Rojava Green Again in particular), in order to repair the wartorn, terrorized landscape and preserve the other pillars of their revolutionary project including cultural preservation, gender liberation and radical democracy.

It is clearly a partisan bone to enrage Republicans while getting 80s hippies and Greens on his side. It is also worse than climate denial to actively destroy existing GHG free electricity plants. His lobbying in his home state of Vermont lead to the closure of Vermont Yankee, one of the best operating plants prior to its forced shutdown. Vermont now imports hydroelectric power from interstate (it was a net electric exporter before) and now burns natural gas for electricity. Emissions are up, tax revenues are down, and billpayers are stuck with the costs of commissioning new fossil generation and pipelines to match. What is worse?

Then shit REALLY hit the fan in Syria, and people started fleeing as the violence spread and ISIS started gaining territory. So despite having installed and supported un-elected dictators in the Middle East, intentionally de-stabilized the Middle East with a major unprovoked war, and then verbally supported a democratic revolution but failed to actually provide either support or protection for democratic protestors. But when those same protestors (and other regular people) lost their homes and loved ones to violence WHICH THE US CAUSED AND LATER CONDONED, the US closed its borders to them, even going so far as to elect an obviously incompetent and dangerous buffoon based on his promise that he would institute a ""total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States"", despite the fact that those very Muslims were only trying to enter the United States because their homeland had been destroyed by violence which the US initiated, condoned, and said it would protect them from but then failed to actually protect them from. tl;dr - Americans would rather shut their eyes and ears and hearts and pretend they can't see Muslims dying by the truckload BECAUSE OF AMERICAN POLICIES than attempt to mitigate or atone in even the most basic ways for the violence which they enthusiastically condoned when it was just happening on the news.",UCba9xn-9X_oWfyuswlsgu0Q,1,UgwjPruruSULXR2IQ2l4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

In fact, they persecuted socialists once they got into power (see Martin Niemoller's famous poem which starts with the words: ""First they came for the socialists..."").

It would be great if LA and other SoCal cities bc they are completely depleting the Colorado River and the other limited, clean water sources in the desert that is SW USA due to their insanely high populations. We can totally afford to waste all of that clean water on the ridiculous amount of golf courses and non native plant life that people import. Not an issue at all. It’s not like we are staring an impending water crisis in the face or anything. Nope. Besides there constantly being restrictions on the amount of water available to the general population, it often isn’t the safest to drink (whether that is due to infrastructure, increased fracking, or other contaminates , idk) No clue how dirty the ocean is on that side of the country, but if the desalination process could also filter out the micro plastics and pharmaceutical remnants that could seriously be a game changer.

I agree that people need to be more conscientious of what they&#39;re consuming, but removing all animal products really isn&#39;t the answer. Removing some could help the environment, but some are honestly beneficial and we would be worse off without them.<br /><br /> A lot of vegetable farming relies directly on animal farming to be efficient, or benefits from it greatly. Livestock consumes a lot of wastes that we dont use from farming, like corn shucks and stalks.Using manure is better than fertilizers in most cases, as manure releases nutrients gradually and has less destructive runoff than chemical fertilizers. Making clothes from cotton and wool is much better for the environment than various synthetic plastics that break down slightly every time they are washed and release particles into the water that will never break down.<br /><br /> Not to mention some animal products are able to be used without harm to the animals if it is done ethically. Animal consumption will never stop. And honestly, it shouldn&#39;t. Its much more effective and realistic to advocate for the consumption of more ethically and responsibly acquired animal products than it is to advocate for them being removed entirely. Like acquiring eggs and meat from local farmers or companies that are more responsible. Boycotting all animal products just gives more power to large industries and makes smaller and less destructive farmers struggle.",UCVVanSgyH-j7K0bXJSYt2pA,0,UgyOXdmCMkLzXgQ_3yd4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

Of course, that sector has its own name for it: reactance. The knee-jerk response which results from any perceived restriction on personal freedom, no matter how well-meaning or minuscule.<br />Turns out that if you&#39;re looking to make somebody quit smoking, one of the worst ways of doing so is to tell them, &quot;you should quit smoking.&quot; This is especially true if you are in some position of authority, even nebulous authority; this is why doctors regularly face this. After all, they are in the business of trying to improve people&#39;s health, but faced with what could be seen as a limitation on their freedom from an authority figure, the average smoker&#39;s response is hostility, even doubling down on their habits.<br />That&#39;s what I think is the great tragedy of climate change: a poor understanding of reactance has contributed to climate change denial. But the good news is that doctors have spent decades trying to figure out how to work around reactance, and they&#39;ve figured some things out.

It’s just that life will get a lot harder for humans. then I realized me pursuing my interests isn’t what’s causing the issue. To solve this problem it’s about getting people in charge who actually want to do something about this. It’s about making lifestyle changes. I can do these while pursuing my interests at the same time. I also realized it’s not that we don’t know what to do. We DO. It’s just that we have people in charge who won’t do it. I think the problem can be remedied. Will things get worse first? Probably. Could it require more extreme means? Yes. But I think it’s doable. The Paris agreement was proof of it. I have a friend who thinks it’s more on China than us and yet China is still in the agreement! So the rest of the world will exceed the U.S at something else, shocker.

I&#39;ve been hoping Natalie would tackle climate change at some point, and this video did not disappoint. As usual, production values (especially for youtube) are through the roof, and the subject is extensively well-researched. That being said, I do want to push back a little against Natalie&#39;s insinuation that adopting a vegan lifestyle is a necessary component of fighting climate change. While a vegan lifestyle certainly <i>can</i> help, it&#39;s also totally unnecessary. It seems Natalie has (at least somewhat) bought into the false dichotomy presented by most vegans: that you either go vegan <i>or</i> you&#39;re a careless meat eating polluter who is actively helping to destroy the earth. The thing is, there totally are sustainable alternative animal farming practices that not only produce little to no carbon emissions, but can actually reduce emissions in the long run. Do a google search for &quot;adaptive multi-paddock&quot; or &quot;AMP&quot; grazing. Vegans conveniently ignore the fact that it has been totally scientifically proven that we can continue to eat meat <i>and</i> reduce carbon emissions from animal farming to net zero. We don&#39;t have to stop eating meat at all, we just have to change our farming practices. But vegans pretend this isn&#39;t a thing because it goes against their <i>real</i> agenda of &quot;don&#39;t hurt the poor widdle animals&quot;. So they pretend their lifestyle is all about saving the environment when in reality it&#39;s all about the fact they have the mindset of children who think &quot;Charlotte&#39;s Web&quot; is a goddamn documentary or something and the idea of poor little Wilbur getting sent to the slaughterhouse makes them cry. Not to mention the false dichotomy also lets them feel morally superior to meat eaters. It&#39;s a win-win for their egos! If they <b>really</b> cared about the environment they would promote animal agriculture <i>reform</i> rather than abolition. It&#39;s a much easier stance to get people on board with, and much more practical in the long run. But as long as vegans continue to see animals as a bunch of lovable furry buddies instead of the walking biofuel for our stomachs that they really are, they&#39;ll continue to conveniently ignore the more practical and achievable alternatives",UCnGBYLgi2TVLHlFuHek4a3Q,0,UgxWTcDY9kQft23L4xh4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

Now mind you, I actually found your comment to be very informative in terms of how we should structure our diets. Honestly, I'll keep that in mind next time I think about ordering steak.

To find the healthiest diet all we need to look at is the eating traits of the early people, which remained stable for several hundred thousand years which is time to adapt to those selection pressures. Only in the last ten thousand years has our diet really changed to be what it is today. It is a myth to believe that early man relied on eating a meat based diet because we know that catching animals to eat was difficult and often risky. We know that early man spent most of there time foraging and ate a diet that was high in nuts, berries, fruits, root vegetables, eggs, fish, crustaceans and fungi. The meat that people were eating was not red meets from large animals but more likely from small easy to catch species such as birds and rabbits. This is why chicken is the ""healthiest meat"" as its the one we are most adapted to eat. Humans would have access to red meats but only occasionally and not in the frequency that we do today. Our bodies are adapted to eat red meats at a low frequency not every day. We also has little access to sugar and salt which is why we desire it so much, our bodies are not suited to eating it at every meal or even every day. This is why salt is the leading cause of stomach and intestinal cancer and our bodies process such in the way they do, leading to diabetes and weight gain. Coupled with our diets is exercise! We do very little in comparison to what we were designed to do. Most people don't even reach what our bodies are capable of per day in several weeks.

Here is Cook’s summary of his paper: “Cook et al. (2013) found that over 97 percent [of papers he surveyed] endorsed the view that the Earth is warming up and human emissions of greenhouse gases are the main cause.” This is a fairly clear statement—97 percent of the papers surveyed endorsed the view that man-made greenhouse gases were the main cause—main in common usage meaning more than 50 percent. But even a quick scan of the paper reveals that this is not the case. Cook is able to demonstrate only that a relative handful endorse “the view that the Earth is warming up and human emissions of greenhouse gases are the main cause.” Cook calls this “explicit endorsement with quantification” (quantification meaning 50 percent or more). The problem is, only a small percentage of the papers fall into this category; Cook does not say what percentage, but when the study was publicly challenged by economist David Friedman, one observer calculated that only 1.6 percent explicitly stated that man-made greenhouse gases caused at least 50 percent of global warming. Where did most of the 97 percent come from, then? Cook had created a category called “explicit endorsement without quantification”—that is, papers in which the author, by Cook’s admission, did not say whether 1 percent or 50 percent or 100 percent of the warming was caused by man. He had also created a category called “implicit endorsement,” for papers that imply (but don’t say) that there is some man-made global warming and don’t quantify it. In other words, he created two categories that he labeled as endorsing a view that they most certainly didn’t.",UCfqgT9Ux0rwjiwu2jyCt62Q,1,UgxSMalfvtBz0lgKb9J4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

However, at this point, I think I would like to see some credible sources for this string of statistics and your assertion that we have nothing to worry about. Because I flat out don't believe you.

Natalie has kindly provided an instructional video in these techniques in her ""Decoding the Alt-Right"" video; and incidentally, ""repackaging"" is one of those techniques, so it's interesting you bring it up. I'm not a climate scientist, so I don't really know what all your numbers mean. I doubt you're a climate scientist either; I think you're pulling this stuff out of your ass. What I *do* know is that 97% of the world's climate scientists see the statistics and they are alarmed. Since 97% of people in the world don't even agree that the Holocaust happened, I am inclined to believe them, not some rando on an internet comments section.

It's just that these companies don't give a shit, because it would cost them money to use them, and the fines they get for breaking regulations are a joke. Besides, even if we do succeed in developing an easy, cheap, and widely-available method of reclaiming atmospheric carbon, it's still not a good bet to keep burning all our hydrocarbons like we have been.

Fossil evidence suggests that most of the world in the Cretaceous Period was extremely hot and wet; that's way the dinosaurs are always shown in jungle environments in documentaries. There was also a period of extreme global cooling, which also caused mass extinctions, that scientists believe was caused by the opening of the Atlantic Ocean, which incorporated more carbon into sediments: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/05/150528083818.htm.

As these microscopic plants and animals lived, they absorbed energy from the sun, which was stored as carbon molecules in their bodies. When they died, they sank to the bottom of the sea. Over millions of years, layer after layer of sediment and other plants and bacteria were formed. Stage 2 - As they became buried ever deeper, heat and pressure began to rise. The amount of pressure and the degree of heat, along with the type of biomass, determined if the material became oil or natural gas. More heat produced lighter oil. Even higher heat or biomass made predominantly of plant material produced natural gas. Stage 3 - After oil and natural gas were formed, they tended to migrate through tiny pores in the surrounding rock. Some oil and natural gas migrated all the way to the surface and escaped. Other oil and natural gas deposits migrated until they were caught under impermeable layers of rock or clay where they were trapped. These trapped deposits are where we find oil and natural gas today. https://adventuresinenergy.org/What-are-Oil-and-Natural-Gas/How-Are-Oil-Natural-Gas-Formed.html",UCHcwtSw1AnOyV-WVcfZx5wA,1,UgxSMalfvtBz0lgKb9J4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

I feed my son all the meat he wants bc he's into serious school athletics, while also supporting my daughter's decision to go vegan when she was 14, even tho I was nervous about her health. I was relieved when she gave it up after a year. She was a little chubby and wanted to lose some weight, it would seem. She only eats white meat like me, now. She's also managed to keep the weight off. She's a beautiful girl :) I wouldn't let a younger child eat vegan, tho. I knew one who lost all her teeth at 6 years old bc of vitamin deficiencies, poor thing. I think she might be in foster care now.

The guy was a poe *smh* On eggfish's thread, I got into a bit of a scuffle with somebody who claims to have background in Cognitive Neuroscience, and yet quoted this NEAVS handout like it was the only source that existed (Yeah, I found their source bc the way they quoted it was so bobbleheadish.) My guess would be that they dropped out of the social sciences bc of the way research was conducted in their field, without going far enough in their program to understand what other social sci research entails. They seemed to be projecting a lot of guilt at me. I also found it annoying that this person was quoting an *American* study about biomed labs at Harvard. *I didn't go to Harvard.* And I chose my program after rejecting several others (Guelph's veterinary medicine program for one) *because the people in my field are making a difference.* I mentioned Clyde Snow and Dian Fossey in my very first post. Strigi didn't seem to know or care who they are. It's unfortunate that I couldn't make that person understand.

Internet vegans are for sure very different from the vegans I've met. That often goes for internet versions of movements. Oh I'm just remembering about a vegan girl I know, who told someone she doesn't eat honey (because he asked if she wanted honey in her tea) and this guy started to question her ideas and mock her a little bit. And she said something along the lines of ""alright, this is organic raw honey so it's not all bad, but it doesn't mean the bees are any less imprisoned"" and she left it at that. But I could feel the tension. It's annoying to constantly have people mock you for very personal decisions. That is exactly why I will never push my ideas on others. I sure love a friendly discussion but it has to stay friendly. It's good to share viewpoints I think. Just somehow when it comes to food it gets messy so quickly! I read about the things you do and good on you! You don't deserve to be bashed for only going halfway. Halfway is still something and I know for sure it's not easy for everyone to go vegan. And it's good that you're conscious about where your food comes from. And as a mom myself I know how hard it can be to make any kind of lifestyle change, while chasing after your kids. Good on you for doing what you can :) I personally don't think I can go vegan just yet, because I'm pregnant and I've already developed anaemia after I stopped eating meat. I've got to do it step by step, slowly figuring out what changes to make to my diet to include everything I need. It would also help to have some sort of income. I'm living with my dad now and he's supportive of my decision not to eat meat so that's easy enough, but I don't want them to have to buy fortified vegan milks for me.",UCAHO1CCAcVp0QIOB_gHL3_Q,1,UgwooUtkr35c-J56kwN4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

So I get why it seems that vegans/vegetarians are pushing their ideas but in reality it's really the other way around. It's difficult to see that I guess, if you just don't have that experience. I saw a video recently titled: things not to say to a vegan. And that video really sums up all of the annoying things you hear constantly. This goes for anything that goes against the social norm. Like not shaving your armpits as a woman. Or men who do shave their armpits. Or tattoos in certain places. Or a strange hairstyle.

I even know a raw vegan who very passionately believes he should only eat plant based foods from the area he is in when they are in season, and he eats it as is. He talks about his eating habits a lot but he never really pushes his ideas. He's just very passionate about them. I don't personally know anyone who is vegan because of health issues. I would personally go vegan not because I think humans shouldn't eat animal products. I think that's a completely natural thing for us. But I cannot support the way it is produced and the impact it has on the earth. I would never push that idea on others, that is just my own decision. I firmly believe in the statement: if you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem. That's not to say I think everyone should go vegan. There's many other ways to make a change.

Those who do it for health reasons (i.e. they've had food poisoning and can't eat meat anymore) are the kind you know. They just say they don't eat meat so nobody will make them sick trying to feed it to them. The environmentalists can go either way. Sometimes they'll talk about the hole in the ozone and what needs to be done to slow down that runaway train. But ultimately, most of them know that unless Big Business stops what they're doing to pollute the planet, the rest of us are just rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic, as it were.

And that's entirely understandable really. As a meat eater I felt so guilty whenever any of my friends offered me (very good) vegan food, or when I saw videos of animals being tortured on Facebook. I especially felt guilty after rescuing 6 newborn puppies from the trash. I loved them and felt sad for them because it was so real. They had no mom because of some shitty asshole and they will forever suffer for it. My mom took one of the dogs so I still see him from time to time, and he clearly has a lot of separation anxiety. Anyway I felt so guilty because other animals are going through similar traumatic things, arguably worse even because no one is rescuing them and they live miserable lives without love until they die. And me eating meat was essentially supporting a business I did not want to support But I felt guilty because I felt guilty. Not because vegan people were always telling me to go vegan. I know many, many vegan people and none of them push their ideology on other people. They tend to be passionate about their lifestyle but that is in no way pushy or condescending. I was a vegetarian for 4 years before (and again now) and honestly I got a lot more shit from meat eaters than I got from vegetarians/vegans while I was eating meat. Of course a vegan will say they are vegan. When you eat what is socially acceptable, you don't realize how many social get-togethers are centered around food. And a lot of it isn't vegan. So a vegan will say that they don't eat that food. That is not condescending, that is just informing others that you don't want to eat the food they are offering. Again, meat eaters are a lot worse when it comes to this. When I was a vegetarian before (I've only recently stopped eating meat again), whenever I would say ""oh I don't eat that, I'm a vegetarian"" someone would wave some meat in my face in an attempt to seduce me into eating meat. And another person would go in a long discussion with me about ""what if you were on an island and all you could eat was meat."" And yet another would aggressively argue that it's not natural not to eat meat.

Injection of sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere is an actually feasible solution that will counteract the affects of carbon dioxide as sulfur dioxide absorbs shorter wavelengths of radiation (which is primarily what&#39;s coming from the sun). We have already seen examples of this working from volcanic eruptions, mainly the Pinatubo eruption. Real Engineering recently did a video on this that does a fantastic breakdown of the idea.<br /><br />I don&#39;t want to assume you didn&#39;t know any of this, and I think you&#39;re just focusing more on the politics and sociology surrounding climate change.

If everyone would just eat meat a few times a week, greenhouse gas emissions would change massively! Unfortunately, with too many people being reluctant to eat less meat, some people have to go full vegan to balance it all out. But reducing your meat intake definitely helps.

That is the problem with going vegan and getting others to go vegan is ether it doesn't taste good, or it is hard to find and requires a lot more skill relative to the final resulting taste. So when you tell someone to become vegan you are in a way saying, ""go abandon all your family recipes and years of being taught cooking by your parents for this other thing that you don't know how to do and will have to re-learn what you already know but in a different way"". Sorry that message is hard to accept for most people. However a vegetarian friend of mine has done a lot so somewhat convert me. The way he did it is not preaching anything, unless you ask him then he will tell you all about it. What he did was bring in food and share it and share the recipe if asked. He would also invite others to lunch and make suggestions of really good dishes to try. Never did he bring up if the dish was vegan or not, just that it taste good and he wants to share it with me. Before I knew it I was eating like a vegetarian because everything was delicious. Now I am not vegetarian and never will be. I have no problem eating meat if that is what I feel like having.

I buy 5 or 6 cosmetic products about every 5 years. I check to make sure they're not tested on animals. 6) I'm dirt poor, so most of what I own was either gifted to me, donated or bought second hand. Even if I had money, I wouldn't spend much on new things. 7) I recycle 90% of the recyclable plastics, newspapers, and such that come through my household. I wash and reuse 10-20% of them, as well. Why buy empty plastic containers when you can buy them full of food for less than 25% more, and then wash them up when you're done? 8) I've picked up many stray animals off the street over the years and cared for them.

There's a vegan human neuroscientist in my city who buddied up with a promatologist who uses water deprivation and drug addiction on the animals he abuses. If all the people who do research outside captive animal testing stood up to it it would change. But everyone is too ""scientific"" to be ethical. All of science and medicine has a long history of human and other animal abuse, colonialism, etc. Paleontologist western men back in the day would round up endangered species to find the missing link, etc. Your field is not immune is what I'm saying. Someone's always arguing that discovery matters more than abuse. Im glad that people are fighting dissection in colleges still but that was a fight that started decades ago.

And that thing with inducing learned helplessness in dogs with electric shocks *smh* It may please you to know that there are people at my school who are pushing to stop animal dissections in hs and undergrad biology programs, and replace them with computer simulations. It's a step in the right direction, at least. Other than that, the term ""paleo"" means ancient. We study fossilized creatures that are long dead. Primatologists study apes and monkeys in the wild, and sometimes in zoos (many primate species are severely endangered and actually need to be there for their protection :( ) Not sure which animals other subfields of paleontology would study in the wild.

When I say Murrican I'm not meaning Americans, but that sub-sect of Americans - the George Bush era, flag waving, Freedom bombing types. But I can understand that it comes across as really dicky, generalizing, etc. As far as the multinationals point: Is that in the US that the Saudis are buying up? I was very general with that remark - should be careful with that, huh? Obviously, everyone can come in and buy up - there's actually a lot of issue in Scotland currently with the iconic highlands being bought up by folks from all about the show, wanting to have the kinds of property rights they might have in, say, the US. What I guess I was - badly - communicating was that we perceive the American Right as simply wanting their business chums and donors to be able to come and invest in the vital infrastructures of our countries, to add to their portfolio. Oftentimes I'll see the folks that think in such a manner commenting on our policies in that respect, dismissing us, blahblah. As for the terms... I know the term Nationalism is taken to be Right Wing, but there are many aspects that would read, to a Republican type, to be Left Socialist, or at least not Liberal Capitalist. But then, the ethos is Right Wing, for sure. Nationalism is an interesting one, because it was a pretty significant contender to the Imperial arrangements in many areas, but was also utilized by some of the other Empires (Russia, France, Germany, & mainland Britain). *Mercantilism isn't really Capitalism in the Liberal/Free Market Capitalism sense. I guess you could consider it State Capitalism. The usual suspect Purists would see it as state intervening Leftiness, I'd think. *It's BIZARRE that Monarchy etc would be considered Left *Theocracy, yeah, I suppose with the Evangelicals that would end up being a strange one over there. *Militarism, Aristocracy/Feudalism - Yeah, In the US I suppose the latter would be seen as somewhat Left... Odd, don't you think? Not at all in tune with the proletariat class politics of the Left. I'm not familiar with Thoreau. I'll have a further look.

You're right I see it from an American point of view and to me ""right"" largely equates with our founding principals. I also agree that how I see the American right could correctly be called classically liberal, or frankly just liberal yes. I feel the need to add ""classically"" to separate it from the modern usage of liberal in the US which is more correctly Marxist. In the US we more commonly use Libertarian instead of classically liberal, or as you'd mean just liberal. ""the Americans will call it all Leftism unless we let American-based multinationals come in and buy everything."" - I disagree here, certainly at least in the current political climate. We're being bought up by the Saudi's anyway. I'd say this globalist free trade thing is actually more ""left"" by American standards. The ""right"" is much more protectionist. ""If you were to describe Nationalism, Mercantilism, Imperialism, Monarchism, Theocracy, for example, they would probably be interpreted as Leftist by Murrican ""Right Wingers"""" - First please stop saying ""Murrican"" it's insulting. - Second those terms: * Nationalism, absolutely not, that term is very much associated with the ""right"" in the US. * Mercantilism, frankly I had to look that one up, that'd be considered a synonym for capitalism in the US and thus ""right"". * Imperialism and Monarchism, those would be considered ""left"" in the US. * Theocracy, that's a tough one, religion is thought of as right, but a true theocracy, not sure, doesn't really come up. ""Feudalism/Aristocracy and Militarism is also seen as Right Wing."" - Militarism yes, the others no. - ""hold that certain social orders and hierarchies are inevitable, natural, normal or desirable, typically supporting this position on the basis of natural law, economics or tradition."" - I'd agree with that, but with the addition of a bit of Thoreau ""that government is best which governs least""",UCN2FgvsE5JIitrmeiysW1ZA,1,Ugxkd76wXov3AjXu8eF4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

I don't look at Left/Right as being opposite economic concepts, or even economic outlooks necessarily. The Right only evokes the spirit of anarchism in the US, really, and I think that's because being ""Right"" in the US; a Conservative/Traditionalist/Constitutionalist etc means that you're committed to the original outlook of the US, which was anti- the monarchy it had just fought, reluctantly accepting of the federal government, and just very much characterized by an 'as few rules as possible' kind of flavour. Now, leaving aside that the ranks of the modern Murrican Right are filled with hypocrisy and all the rest, assuming someone is actually sincerely of the persuasions that the American Right is meant to be, they would be a Liberal, and wouldn't want restrictions of any kind, really. it's not necessarily how we see things throughout Europe and the Anglosphere - though it has seeped in. The equivalents have entirely different outlooks, with quite different traditions etc. But the Americans will call it all Leftism unless we let American-based multinationals come in and buy everything. If you were to describe Nationalism, Mercantilism, Imperialism, Monarchism, Theocracy, for example, they would probably be interpreted as Leftist by Murrican ""Right Wingers"" because of the States' reach and function and because of the not being inherently Capitalistic, despite these systems being more broadly associated with the Traditionalist/Reactionary/Conservative Right. Anarchism would be the absolute antithesis to the Right outside of the US. Feudalism/Aristocracy and Militarism is also seen as Right Wing.

Compare it to the heat of a city for example, the accumulative heat energy given off by heating homes, driving cars, computers, us, etc. What's the cumulative effect of that, how does that scale, the numbers are huge.

I'll post that list of things I do to fight climate change here for you as well, so you don't have to go looking for it. I can also find other sources that will expose Strigi for the slandering hypocrite they are (if you're actually reading all of this lol) I've done almost no editing, so keep in mind that my harsh tone is for Strigi the Slanderer, not for you, Cayla. This particular response was posted about a dozen replies into a discussion where I'd already stated calmly, more than once, that I would look into Strigi's rather far fetched claims about research practices in my field. Strigi also called me classist for stating that s/he ought stop preaching and come up to the standards s/he sets for others. I wrote: ""1) You (Strigiform) are totally wrong about Koko the gorilla (or your idea of what cruelty is is totally messed up.) 2) I don't eat beef or pork. I eat fish, chicken and turkey 4 or 5 times/ week due to issues with my digestion 3) I buy organic farm fresh products, including eggs whenever I can. And Canadian dairy is not like American. 4) *I've never owned a car.* I refuse. That trumps all the yapping you vegans usually do right there :P 5) I rarely wear makeup. I buy 5 or 6 cosmetic products about every 5 years. I check to make sure they're not tested on animals. 6) I'm dirt poor, so most of what I own was either gifted to me, donated or bought second hand. Even if I had money, I wouldn't spend much on new things. 7) I recycle 90% of the recyclable plastics, newspapers, and such that come through my household. I wash and reuse 10-20% of them, as well. Why buy empty plastic containers when you can buy them full of food for less than 25% more, and then wash them up when you're done? 8) I've picked up many stray animals off the street over the years and cared for them. I love cats. 9) And HELLO. I just said DIAN FOSSEY IS MY HERO FFS. SHE DIED FOR HER GORILLAS. 10) I entered a field of study that is making a difference in the world. I plan to finish my degree as soon as life stops kicking me in the teeth, and get out there with my colleagues and do what I'm passionate about. Idgaf what you (Strigiform) say about our research practices. I'm pretty sure you're wrong and blaming us for what the psych people are doing. *But I will look into it thoroughly* and if you're right, I'll do what I can about it when the time comes. *As I've already stated. * Oh, and unlike the character in the vid, I don't drink, either. In 10 years, I've had fewer than a dozen drinks bc my body can't process that, just like it can't process full meatlessness. Judging from the way you (Strigiform) are misreading my comments, I'd guess that you probably drink like a fish.""

Being called a 'racist' for correcting somebody's grammar and suggesting an online translator is just absurd. People who edit their posts so they're making an entirely different assertion *after I've already responded* are particularly annoying. Even more annoying are people like Strigi who read one study on *American* practices and assume that everything everywhere is the same, and use their misconceptions to *willfully misquote and defame me* and other people in my field. The German kid was somewhat forgivable bc his English was meh. Strigiform is telling blatant lies about what I said to them. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-ArJRqEvU&t=9s *<<* I guess people on the left can also be guilty of Trumpsplaining to prove an agenda. If you're interested in reading what I *actually wrote* in my discussion with Strigiform, it's on a thread that a commenter called eggfish started. I included a numbered list of everything I'm doing to fight climate change. Or just ask me, and I'll copy and paste it here. I'm far from a corporate shill. That accusation is the second most disgusting contrivance I've heard yet. Others with my political leanings (centre left) likely would have become staunch Tories (Republicunts) after that attack. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69obN625Fjs The 'Angry Jack' effect is not what's at play, here. I'm a reasonable human being who is responding appropriately to being *misquoted, lied about, and defamed.* Of course I'm angry. More so with Strigi than the kid who admitted to trolling. Again. If you do decide that your body can handle being fully vegan, don't go all preachy about it. And don't accuse people *who have already met you 75% of the way* on the vegan issue (and a number of other issues for that matter) of being homicidal, wife beating, puppy torturing Nazis.

Her attacks on your language and so on were disgusting, her refusal of accountability even moreso. She has an obvious prejudice against vegans and a need to feel better about her own choices to harm animals through attacking vegans using false and misleading information. She is exactly what Contra is talking about in the video.

That obviously hasn't happened in this thread as you've ""won"" thus debate 1000 times over. She's just jumping on every vegan comment to preach about about her diet and lifestyle and then is completely ignorant of how ridiculous her claims of how preachy vegans are look. Thank you for making sure accurate information is out there for people deciding to go vegan. Much love and again I'm sorry about the childish attacks youve had to suffer.

That sounds more like you are the one in need of help but whatever I have to cut you some slack though, in a conversation in the comments of a youtube video I am more concernt with proving my point and bringing good arguments than about my grammar. I simply ment that I may.made a grammar mistake, but my point still came across, and that you should not make such a fuss about it, because it has no place in that conversation Well as I said, you can still say racist things even though you do not believe in race. That does not make it less racist. Well again that is just cliche and has no point in a conversation, and don't you think judging people from other nations based on cliches is a little bit racist?

So I pointed out your mistakes, without any ill will. After a while I became less polite cause you insulted me multiple times and try to frame me as somethig I am not but thats it. Well I, contrary to you, I try to work on my mistakes and asked an english student and an britain Citizen to proofread my comments so I could avoid the mistakes I made in the future.

But I have to say that you really help me out by always saying I just misunderstood you. Because everybody who reads this conversation will see that I did not and my points all were valid.

It's true, though. It's very unusual for poor people to mess around with chia seeds and omega supplements and bean sprouts. They eat the cheapest, most filling and easiest to store things they can buy on a budget. That usually means a lot of canned pasta and meat that's not much better than dog food, and frozen entrees. Tbh, it's kind of amazing that we humans can go against our genetic predispositions when it comes to food. As far as I know (and yeah I'm half guessing this time, too :P) Orcas are the only other species who appear to do that when food is plentiful. We humans are the potential food source that the Orcas refuse to eat. So calling something ""fucking bourgeois"" is not always totally piss-and-vinegar derogatory on my end.

Not against vegans or the practice of eliminating meat from their diet. *I'm arguing against poor nutrition choices.* Energy drinks are about as healthy as coffee. They most certainly *do not replace meat.* Just GAH. Protein shakes are decent. They can replace most of what we're supposed to be eating in a day, including the meat. At least for a time... but a person will get pretty bunged up if that's all s/he puts in his/her stomach for a week or more. Brown bread and the right vegetable combination is ok... But that has to include legumes, avocadoes and nuts. Not everybody can function for longer than a few weeks on that diet, either. I would want to take some omegas with that. But then we're right back to square one with the cost. On the bright side, I looked up the cost of B vitamins. They're not as much as I thought. The price works out to about 50 cents/ pill. So about a quarter of the cost of a protein shake. But then there are the omegas, like I said, and I'm pretty sure they're expensive and have an annoying short shelf life.

But it is most likely that many people do not already drink that. Energy Drinks like Monster on the other hand are really popular. So I chose them as an example because most non-vegans are already familiar with that. But I have to admit, the most reliable way of getting B12 is with vitamine pills. You do not need any protein shakes when you live vegan. You might need them if you want to get ripped and work out.

I watched a whole vid where she came across as insufferably preachy, and then she stated outright that she doesn't care what other people eat. I had to go back for another listen before I realized that she was quoting smthg verbatim. The key to *not sounding like a self righteous twat* is in your pronoun use, btw. Don't frame your arguments as absolutes. Always say ""I like"" and ""I do"" and ""I think"" and keep your revulsion over other people's food choices to yourself.

Important stuff to be wary of: There are plenty of vegans on youtube that like to stay in their own ''vegan cult'', but there are reasonable ones that do not promote unhealthy diets from which you might end up at the hospital, be careful. There are websites that can track how many nutrients you have to consume in a day so that you won't feel weak by forgetting something. If you do consider going vegan you will have to take b12 supplements since that is something that is hard to get with a vegan diet. If you want to eat something tasty you will have to up your cooking level(assuming it's low), well at least for myself there aren't any vegan restaurants or anything nearby. You can, however, cook some tasty shit that you wouldn't imagine could be ''vegan'' if you do up it.

I don't consider all animal life equal, but I do think that if a society in which the industrial killing of animals isn't necessary to have everybody's nutritional and most culinary needs covered, we should eventually move to that model. Animals are driven mostly by instincts and not by thoughts, that's true, but they do have feelings, and can have happy lives, they aren't the same as the rest means of production that are inanimate and non-sentient beings. So I see the killing of animals that could live long happy lives if we didn't put an end to them as morally wrong if the mass replacement of most animal products by cheap good quality vegan products that fulfill most people culinary needs is posibble. Which right now isn't, that's why I advocate for eventually moving to veganism, not doing it right now. I agree with you on that making laws to make the treatment of animals more ethical and minimizing suffering as much as possible while keeping the animal industry is something we should move towards too.",UC8OiRBA15n4Vq0Oh7ttwHUw,1,UgxX3tWPq-IHtqxYRR54AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

As I said on my other comment, PRIORITES!! How useful am I being to animals if my lack of pragmatism helped to the mass extinction of all animal life in the near future?? I understand where you are coming from, vegan activism is fucked up, specially online. You can find so many terrible, terrible vegan youtubers advocating for very unhealthy diets, with very strange conspirational or mystical beliefs... and animal rights organizations like PETA or animal rights political parties are sometimes quite cringy too, but on my everyday life I normally agree on most issues with the non-militant vegans and vegetarians that I meet, although I have my disagreements with the average vegetarian/vegan.

I am totally for the humane treatment of animals and support any (reasonable) efforts to minimize their suffering. I think along with the sustainable farming methods I mentioned above, we should also adopt methods of keeping and breeding livestock that minimizes their suffering as much as possible. I simply think that the view that they shouldn't be killed for any reason at all whatsoever is infantile (not to mention wholly impractical). Many of the vegans I speak to tend to anthropomorphize the shit out of them. Thus the ""Charlotte's Web"" reference I made above, since I get the distinct impression that's how many of them view them, like a bunch of talking singing little buddies. They are not. While they may have some rudimentary sentience, they are largely driven by instinct rather than thought, and pretty much every carnivorous animal would happily eat you without a second thought as to the moral implications of it, since they are simply not capable of such complex thought. Even your beloved cat or dog will straight up eat your corpse if you die in your house and aren't discovered for a while. That's just the way life is. Things consume other things for energy. We are biofuel for each other, plain and simple.

I suppose I did generalize a bit too much in my original post. Sorry, it's just a bit of a sore spot for me since I think that the ""stop producing all animal products because killing animals for any reason is wrong!"" crowd are actively standing in the way of real progress and achievable solutions to climate change in order to support an extremist view that is quite frankly childish. The nuanced, reasonable form of veganism you promote, actually IS a form of veganism I could get behind. Maybe not something I would practice myself, but it's at least a type of veganism that wouldn't irritate me with its hypocrisy and that I could empathize with. I also appreciate that you acknowledged that even some vegan products such as palm oil are extremely destructive to the environment as well, so even the products eaten on a vegan diet should be researched and vetted to minimize carbon impact. Climate change is a complicated issue and I suppose nuance is important on both sides. Just to clarify, my point wasn't so much ""veganism sucks!"", as it was that veganism shouldn't necessarily be promoted as the panacea to climate change that it often is. The reason my post came off so hostile to vegans was because, in my personal experience, whenever I speak to vegans about this issue, and suggest animal agriculture reform as a more reasonable solution, they tend to go into this whole thing about how we shouldn't be killing animals at all. And they almost always do it with an air of ""holier than thou"" snark. Sorry if I overgeneralized though.

If in the future the mass production of animal products is possible without fucking up the planet, I'll be the first one to celebrate it, because I care waaaaaaaaay more about the Earth than I do about having a good argument to convince people to become vegan too. That being said, until that eco-friendly mass production of animal products is a reality (and it doesn't look like it will any time soon), I'll keep encouraging people to become vegan or at least to reduce their consumption of animal products in order to save us from the mass extinction of animal and vegetal life of all kinds. About vegan people lying about being vegan for environmentalist reasons... well... that's just not true. You are free not to believe me, but I did become vegan 100% for environmentalist reasons. That's the truth, sorry if that's inconvenient for your narrative. I do hold more pro animal-rights views now than I did back when I just became vegan, so I'll stay vegan no matter how eco-friendly animal products become in the future (FOR THE RECORD, NOT THAT I'D OPPOSE ANIMAL PRODUCTS BECOMING ECOLOGICALLY SUSTAINABLE, I'D BE REALLY FUCKING HAPPY IF THEY DID, AT THIS POINT ANYTHING TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS WOULD BE WELCOME WITH OPEN ARMS), but the main reason I'm vegan still is that the meat and dairy industries are two of the most polluting industries, not animal rights. Animal rights isn't particularly high on my political priorities list, it just isn't one of the top issues we are facing right now. That's why I don't support for example the animal rights party that is polling around 2% on my country right now and having a boom in popularity. Animal rights parties in my opinion are just joke parties (except the Dutch Party for the Animals, which I'd probably vote if I lived in the Netherlands), I don't understand why would a political party focus exclusively on this issue when we are literally on the edge of a second Holocaust in Europe and America and of the collapse of industrial civilization due to environmental cataclysm.",UC8OiRBA15n4Vq0Oh7ttwHUw,1,UgxX3tWPq-IHtqxYRR54AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

Do a google search for ""adaptive multi-paddock"" or ""AMP"" grazing. That's one of the major problems I have with vegans: they tend to present you with this false dichotomy where you either go vegan _or_ you're an evil meat eating polluter who is actively helping to destroy the earth. They conveniently ignore the fact that it has been totally scientifically proven that we can continue to eat meat _and_ reduce carbon emissions from animal farming to net zero. We don't have to stop eating meat at all, we just have to change our farming practices. But vegans pretend this isn't a thing because it goes against their _real_ agenda of ""don't hurt the poor widdle animals"". So they pretend their lifestyle is all about saving the environment when in reality it's all about the fact they have the mindset of children who think ""Charlotte's Web"" is a goddamn documentary or something and the idea of poor little Wilbur getting sent to the slaughterhouse makes them cry. Not to mention the false dichotomy also lets them feel morally superior to meat eaters. It's a win-win for their egos! If they *really* cared about the environment they would promote animal agriculture _reform_ rather than abolition. It's a much easier stance to get people on board with, and much more practical in the long run.

You basically reinforce the idea, at the end , that everyone should vote democrat as a solution to the issue. It isn’t a solution to the issue. It’s a solution to Trump. Let’s be clear on that distinction. If the democrats get in then they’ll still be pushing neoliberalism and supporting those world-bashing companies. If you look elsewhere in the world, you can often see left/right consensus on climate change. Look at Germany for example. It’s important to build that and not alienate half the voting public from the discussion. And it’s also important to forge a new politics that criticises both sides for gross inaction. You wanna get radical change? Don’t tell people to vote democrat. Except do, because Trump. But it’s more complex than that.

In France where universities are free (like in most of Europe) there is still a class divide around knowledge but I guess it's less radical than in countries where only the wealthy have access to upper education. Working class kids get to go to university if they want to, some don't make it because they don't have good enough grades, but some do, often you can find both in the same family...If I lived in a country where I had to be rich for knowing a lot, then I'd probably be embarrassed to spread my knowledge. I guess I could even be proud of my ignorance as a token of my economic struggles. It seems the US really created an odd kind of democracy, one in which educated people are either presomptuous bourgeois or ashamed middle class people. It wouldn't be less frustrating for the rest of the world if the right hadn't manipulated the poor into being douches.

I appreciate your 'lead by example' mentality, as that's maybe one of the best ways to create change: focus on your life and inspire that work in others. I agree too with having some frustration with the upper class, I live in Massachusetts where a lot of the world's top schools are located, so we have a big obsession with education to the point where it's formed a class system around which school you could afford going to, and if you were too poor for college than your looked down on as lower class. I get really frustrated at how our upper class have ideas for making the state greener but also constantly sneer at the lower class and those that didn't go to college, and I don't understand how they expect people to follow their lead when the are also looking down on the mall the time. I guess living here is where I get my perspective on hearing 'uneducated' all the time as an insult from the same people who also want the planet to be fixed. There is some good though: local farming is actually kind of big here for how small the state is, but we are also very industrial, and for all our solar panels and electric cars I don't think our 'educated' upper class has any plans of shrinking the industry for the sake of the planet.

He introduced me to a gypsy man who has been weeving baskets since he's 6 years old to teach me how to weeve. Now I weeve hedges for my farm. Nothing the educated classes are saying about how to be environmental is true, because they occupy a place in society that they feel scared to abandon, so they will only advice you to change little idiotic things like turn off the switch when you leave a room. Well frankly that's not very helpful. I'm constantly confronted to the resistance of the upper class environmentalists on facebook rather than the poor: they say 'how do I grow vegetables on my balcony in Paris (sarcasm)?"" Well I answer leave Paris. And the issus is, they hate the rest of France because it's considered under educated and reactionary. But I'm lucky I went to study in Paris and I was poor as fuck and the Parisians treated me like shit so that pretty much vaccinated me against the elite and I fled to Amiens and now I'm living on the river, and the picardy people have been telling me they can teach me how to fish, or teach me how to hoe...and I don't ever tell them I don't want to fish or hoe because I'm vegan and I'm permacultural.

So one piece of advice I have is simply: in your heart, if you sincerely respect the beautiful humanity of all people, and you speak from a place of caring, you will be able to find the words to not alienate them. Secondly, I have honestly only ever tried to change my own life for myself, I don't even try to change my husband's ways, I believe in leading by example, if leading at all (i'm anarchist). When people visit my island house on the river, and see my garden, my photovoltaiques and my well, my wood burning stove and ask questions about the isolations and so on and so forth, I always answer truthfully, and because I was careful with my expenses, they are surprised and go away believing that it's possible to life off grid and grow your food. People don't want to be told what to do, but when they see you being happy, if they want what you have then you can help them. For me it's all about promoting the good, natural, happy, loving life, not telling people to reduce this and abstain from that. It's not about a small life it's about an entire change that makes everything you do ok for the planet. I can have long baths. I can eat and drink a lot. I can even smoke my own plants. It's all ok, I never kill a bug, I never pollute. I don't emit. We are fine as humans, we have always lived this way, we need to reclaim it.",UC-xnR3NZGcQ_Lm9kypRnaow,1,Ugwq39BWl5v-FC9j7v54AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

To more accurately answer your question, it's not ""snobbish"" from a wealth perspective, but an intellectual one. Nobody is perfect, so when someone comes along in life and looks down on you for the way your living your life and scolds you for not being intelligent like they are and to change your ways to live like they are living, that's condescending, and I can understand how it's irritating as we all have flaws so you can probably see issues with the way they are living their lives, and you tell yourself they are just hypocritical. Just try and put yourself in the shoes of the person your selling living green to, that's what I try at least, though I haven't found a 'right' way to sell it yet.",UCOeetGKbl41ZWHdnXrHowcQ,1,Ugwq39BWl5v-FC9j7v54AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

Love this video, like all your others.<br />There are some additional points that I think you could&#39;ve raised here.<br />1 - A more thorough discussion of the intersection between class and the ability to practice veganism. While a vegetable-based diet is on its face cheaper than one that includes meat, I think it&#39;s worth mentioning the existence of things like food deserts, people without access to cars or public transport to buy groceries, people with disabilities that may not be able to prepare their own food, etc. While these may not apply to the majority of people, I still think it&#39;s important to take into consideration, as I have seen many of my own leftist friends act in a way that I think is borderline classist and ableist in discussions about the environment. <br />2 - This is more of a minor point, as I&#39;m not sure if this line was meant to be satirical or not, but when Doc mentions eating &quot;pure, clean&quot; vegetables&quot;, I&#39;m a little bit wary of that wording. The assignment of moral value to certain foods can be a precipitating factor for individuals with eating disorders (myself included). I think the point would serve the same purpose if you&#39;d perhaps worded it like, &quot;think of all of the vitamins and minerals you&#39;d be getting from eating more fruits and vegetables!&quot; <br />That said, this is an excellent video as always. :)",UCmj-uyr0DzlnAyJ87iQk0Rw,0,Ugy-zBUV1pbLLxUhFgF4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

Cause lately, I’ve read a lot about torturing in jails and concentration camps so I really don’t understand why should we try because human nature is just really screwed up and whatever we do we end up murdering, starving each other and so on so Schopenhauer was right all along. <br />How can you function as a healthy human being knowing that this very second someone is dying in a camp being beaten to death and no one can help them and nobody really cares? <br />It’s just that they all are shouting in pain right into your ear and then you have to eat and sleep and move on? That makes no sense. Yet it feels like making it a big deal and demanding it to stop by all means necessary is somehow considered naive and stupid even. They always tell you that there&#39;s nothing you can do about it and they are right I guess. But if those people were tortured in our sidewalk, wouldn&#39;t people postpone their business and immediately come to an aide? They&#39;d be angry and appalled and demand it to stop. <br /><br />Why then if something is happening in distant places we can just forget about it?<br /> It&#39;s still happening. We know it&#39;s happening. <br />How can we live with that? <br /> I know that I can. That&#39;s sick. Could it be that so many awful things happen in the world all at once that we just numbed ourselves? I can not blame working people who struggle to feed their families for their lack of concern for Korean prisoners and children prostitution in Thailand. Yet I feel helpless. <br /><br />Donating shit to world organisations is clearly not enough. For me, it&#39;s just clearing my conscience. I also don&#39;t believe that starting bloody wars and revolutions can stop the sufferings of people. The only thing I want is to stop being part of it altogether. The worst part is that I feel like we got used to that somewhere in time and now being really upset and demand an immediate resolution to a problem is naive and silly. <br />It&#39;s like being born into a world where everyone is already a rhinoceros so freaking out and asking questions are just impolite and bad. <br />I&#39;m sorry for such a long text. It has zero meaning, I just wanted to write it off.",UCiyqxdJTym69Z0QKxJYqYZA,0,UgzyYuvxZqj68naII1J4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

I think that while it is true our individual actions don't seem to make a gigantic impact i look at it like this: in german there's a saying that translates to ""steady water flow makes the stone hollow"" so basically it refers to how steadily making small things can end up resulting in something big. if you look at how we as individuals influence eachother it is safe to say that incorperating habits like cutting back on animal products, using public transport etc. will impact not only you but alsp the people arpund you and from my own experience many people are interested in making things better and don't know how so they may follow your example. if we look at hiw nowadays a lot of companies use sustainability as a marketing stradegy it is safe to say that purchasing and valuing things in products that positively affect climate change will make companies realize that they have to change their ways! I know this sounds all very idealistic because it is and i am aware that a lot pf companies who advertise sustainability still do a lot of things that go against that but i think we as consumers have to keep on voting by purchasing these specific products and demanding conqurete evidence for the origins of the resources. sorry for the rant i ubderstand if you don't read it 😅",UC4ufz-e_W9JQSbBIGmV54aw,1,UgwUL7zYhdY_q0cKlvx4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

The trick, I think, is to find ways in your daily life where you'd be doing something out of habit, and instead you challenge yourself to do it differently. Were you going to order meat at the dinner/lunch/when cooking your meal? Don't. Choose the non-red meat, dairy-light option instead - there, that's you making a difference. A bit less consumed, a new habit forming - THAT makes the difference on an individual level. Of course there's voting, spending your money where it matters - LOCALLY, ethically, etc etc, but you have to believe that your individual actions add up to a whole. ripple effects, butterfly effects, if someone as uninformed and lazy as me can make personal changes to my lifestyle, surely I can recommend someone else to do the same and make it easier and save them the time learning that it took me through trial and error and much contemplation? and boom. I've just made an impact greater than my individual self, and you can do the same thing... enough people do that, and suddenly we have changes like how recycling changed everything in terms of reducing waste going to landfills (imagine if we re-used like we recycled how much we'd reduce landfill tonnage then....) ..... other easy ways to make a difference.... Literally use less energy however you can. Unplug chargers, turn lights off, don't use excessive amounts of water, do this at work - do this at hotels, do this wherever you go that you think it might make a difference, and encourage others to do the same. Don't buy products from companies who are irresponsible in their energy usage or who don't care about their emissions, and local is always better than global since the footprint will (usually) always be smaller. inconvenience yourself a little bit, and watch it all get easier and easier and your impact will add up.... I haven't gone completely dairy free but I have educated myself about how much dairy is in almost all the packaged/processed foods I buy, and so I'm careful and make the decision increasingly to buy this stuff less. When I'm in the shop and I reach for the chocolate, or the cereal, or even yoghurt or houmous or crisps - if it has the dairy in it, do I really need to buy this and eat this this time? Can I choose another, or just go without and have something else? And buying milk for my teas/cereal, I make sure to choose local brands, and have gotten used to spending a bit more money for the luxury of having milk. Just smalll... but things to challenge yourself with and if nothing else - feel personally like you're doing OK. hope that helps someone reading this. thanks for reading if you made it all the way here!",UC2TCWsTVbBbx2nKD18HKEZw,1,UgwUL7zYhdY_q0cKlvx4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

They're just questions about common aspects about American society/culture. But to answer your question, I haven't heard of the 8 values test. And my analysis isn't really an analysis. They're just what issues and views one side holds versus another. In America (I keep saying that because I'm no longer in America) people will often say things like ""I'm not racists. I just don't agree to mixing of the races."" or when the topic of any gender, race or religion having hardships comes up, they'll shift the conversations to highlight the hardships that christians, whites, and/or males have had, often with the suggestion, connotation and/or insistence that their hardships are real and equal to or greater than other groups. Usually with the emphasis that either the other group's hardships are of their own making, genetically or culturally, or, that any attempts to relieve the otherside's hardships will increase their hardship which, in turn, is hypocrisy in the ideals and therefore, shouldn't be done. Anyways, to try to answer, what I can perceive, to the purpose of your question, no, I haven't heard of the 8 values test. I'm actually Taiwanese.

But the first thing alt-right people say is that they're independent thinking and don't subscribe to one side or another so that's no indication, other than that's always the first thing they say for some reason. I personally think it's a reflexive admission of guilt. Like if you to buy something and the seller immediately goes ""THAT'S NOT BROKEN!"" or any used car salesman calling themselves ""Honest <insert firstname here>"". But here's a good way for you to figure it out for yourself. 1) Do you feel taxes should not go towards social welfare programs and initiatives like universal health care, welfare and/or universal education? 2) Do you feel that commercial success will almost always enhance and/or progress society? 3) Have you used the terms SJW, liberal or feminist in a derogatory fashion? 4) Do you believe your own observations over science and scientists? 5) When religious text directly contradict scientifically proven concepts, do you believe it over science? 6) Do you feel companies will always provide services better than governments? 7) Do you feel public transportation is only for the poor? 8) Do you feel that poor people are poor due to their own inadequacies? 9) Do you feel that slavery was a choice? 10) Do you feel that some races, by genetics, are more violent than others? 11) Are you uneasy at the thought of races ""mixing""? 12) Have more than 55% of your votes for political officials that are Republicans or Libertarian? 13) Do you feel that your borders are threatened and need to be secured? 14) Do you feel that immigrants are an unfair burden on America? 15) Do you feel uneasy or unjustly persecuted by the #metoo movement? 16) Do you feel that, in the US, the Democrats are just as bad as the Republicans and that's why you either vote Republican or don't vote and tell other people that they shouldn't either because it doesn't make a difference? 17) Do you feel that the morality of the nation is weakened by not allowing public schools to teach religion? 18) Do you feel that Islam is a violent religion that's better off eradicated from the planet? 19) Do any part of my comments here, including the questions above and the answers below, make you feel angry in anyway? So I'm stopping the questions here because I could go on for a long while. These were just off the top of my head. If you answer yes to more than 2~3 of these questions, you're definitely right leaning if not alt-right. If you answer no to any question but yes to the last one, you're definitely alt-right and have trouble admitting it to yourself.

There is good reason to believe that fossil fuels are not necessarily biogenic - that vast amounts of organic material are not necessary to form today's fossil fuel formations. If this is true, and drilling and other mining technologies improve, then fossil fuels will never run out before climate change has become an insurmountable problem. The ""private sector"" didn't just invent horizontal drilling, or CtL, or liquefaction, or deep sea methane clathrate mining (well, this one has yet to enter the market, but only national laboratories have access to the super-deep sea equipment right now). The ""private sector"" appropriated the fruits of the research of the US DOE and entered public private partnerships to grow the fracking of the Marcellus and Permian basin to the size it is today. The private sector _does not invent._ It never has. Never will. It can only ""innovate"" by using government funds and research to find new economic niches. Just as SpaceX took on the best and brightest at NASA and cleared it out, leaving a hollow husk. Or Google's founders taking CSIRO work on search engine algorithms to turn it into the global empire it is today. The idea then, that we should wait for the private sector to invent the zero carbon future without the public sector to drive it, is ahistorical. And I should note that the ""longing for an overpowering state to force it is a recipe that leads to trouble"" is patently false. It is today's governments, overtaken by a corporatist and neoliberal ideology, that has ceded so much power to private organisations and individuals, that has led to oppression. It is the disastrous rise of _non-state power_ that has led the Western world to exchange its _economic_ manacles of _dirigiste_ for the _civil suppression_ manacles of the ""free market"". The neoliberal NAIRU ensures legions of disenfranchised, unemployed people to keep wages down and inequality high. The spiralling social problems from people without purpose - for that is what unemployment is - the drugs, the drink, the broken families, the homelessness - ensures that a police state naturally evolves to keep these social issues tamped down without addressing root causes. Individual ""responsibility"" is pressed for while ""corporate responsibility"" only extends to slaps on the wrist from regulators when financiers drag the world into a global recession, and a golden parachute for those responsible. ""Deregulation"" leads to natural monopolies forming where competition was free before thanks to market rules keeping anti-competitive or collusive behaviour in check. Repeated financial downturns, stagnant innovation, and moribund investment in anything other than derivative financial instruments - that have resulted from the retreat of the state - have demonstrated that the private sector is not fit to invent. It is not fit to self-regulate. It is not fit to even speculate on _what might be profitable_ ; as the disastrous results of betting on securitised debt demonstrate. What we do know is _disastrous_ is that the use of state power to ""incentivise"" decarbonisation leads to the rise of rent seekers. http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/high-costs-and-errors-of-german-transition-to-renewable-energy-a-920288.html The policies that are being pushed today, from taxation to carbon trading to investment credits, are _market_ policies. They have failed. The _dirigiste_ policies that _used_ to be pushed, like France's 1970's nuclear power drive, or Norway's electrification by hydroelectricity, or the Space Race, or the Marshall Plan, worked. The Marshall plan rebuilt a shattered and bleeding Europe. The Space Race got humans to the Moon. France's ""no coal, no oil, no gas, no choice"" policy to nuclearise mean that it enjoys _one fifth_ of the carbon intensity of electricity than Germany. Germans that pay twice as much per kWh, and collectively paying 20 _billion_ Euros a year to ""incentivise"" wind and solar. Oh, and its neoliberal ""personal responsibility"" electricity tariffs drive 300,000 households into energy poverty each year. These are tariffs set by the grid operator, negotiated by the privatised power generation industry. They are suspiciously ""forgiven"" when it comes to German owners of electricity-intensive factories. This is what happens when you rely on the private sector and ""the market"". Failure. But we have succeeded before, and we can succeed again. South Korea and China and Russia are demonstrating this every day when they can build nuclear reactors competitive with coal and cheaper than natural gas. Only in the gas-glutted, imagination-impoverished United States - apparently the home of the brave - is decarbonisation expensive.",UCUjmCjYul-xC-TplX2mkwJQ,1,UgwIGDtIV-AdXFtUaup4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

What we lack is the power of the state, long ago given over to corporate interests and rent seekers. I count greens among them because the policies they have pushed - incentives, subsidies - have failed to deliver a decarbonisation result. Whereas the _dirigiste_ state driven initiatives - in France, Sweden, Norway, Korea, India and now the UAE - have delivered coal- and oil-killing projects. Nuclear power has saved 1.8 million lives - but you wouldn't know it from the apoplexy greens get up to when Dr James Hansen verifies it. https://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/docs/2013/2013_Kharecha_kh05000e.pdf It is a pity that deep greens - entangled in a Heideggerian, Malthusian mindset, would be so opposed to _what works_ and instead cling vehemently to _what has failed._ https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/columnists/iowa-view/2014/10/11/james-hansen-climate-change-speaking-truth-power/17118625/ Historically, only state-driven nuclear and hydro have delivered projects that have eliminated fossil fuels at a scale and speed necessary to combat climate change. http://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6299/547.full?ijkey=7.4C0Yg90r8G.&keytype=ref&siteid=sci Carl Hellesen iterated on Hansen's graph and has produced a better representation of the size and scales involved needed to decarbonise to meet a 2 degrees target: https://jmkorhonen.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/14947747_10154783178612728_7588800298934503291_n.jpg?w=640 Hint: the ""winners"" in the decarbonisation race have not been wind and solar The UAE is but the latest nation that will soon enjoy, as of 2019, a largely decarbonised electricity system. More will follow, especially as Rosatom exercises its options in Eastern Europe, like at Paks in Hungary, prospective projects in Poland, and in Hanhikivi, Finland. More is needed in South East Asia, South America, and in the rapidly developing MENA regions. Once CNPC and CNNC in China clear their massive backlog of RPV orders, expect China to begin to export its reactors. Only Western Europe and the United States stand alone in having a moribund nuclear industry and an anti-nuclear movement rooted in fear so vehement they resort to lying that nuclear is high carbon by citing cranks like Storm Van Leeuwen and using gamed stats from WNISR. The developing world is looking at the atom.

We need economic planning and fully sovereign debt financing of nuclear and renewables to kick fossil fuels out of the grid so that rent-seekers and fig leaf policies like renewable subsidies don't merely _reduce_ fossil fuel use - they _eliminate it._ We need a recognition of the fact that the past _25 years_ of climate diplomacy has failed. Renewable mandates and targets have failed. Carbon trading has failed. Every neoliberal and corporatist policy that has tried to ""incentivise"" the private sector instead of using the might of the public sector, has failed. Every ""market"" intervention only spawns new rent seekers. The solution is not to try to prop up a market but to eliminate it altogether. Build renewables where appropriate. Build nuclear reactors to back up those renewables. Build deferrable loads like desalination and hydrogen electrolysis plants to eliminate water drawdowns and replace natural gas as a key industrial precursor. If you seriously still believe that despite the policies I stand for that I am still, somehow, a fossil fuel shill, you are deliberately misapprehending me.",UCUjmCjYul-xC-TplX2mkwJQ,1,UgwIGDtIV-AdXFtUaup4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

I even have the book by Thomas Dolan on Molten Salt Reactors. I believe that the LFTR as promoted by Kirk Sorenson is unlikely to achieve commercial success. Not the least of which is Kirk choosing to develop his reactor to power military bases. Going through DARPA and the defense procurement process all but guarantees that his reactor will never see civilian use. This all comes back to the requirement of Alvin Weinberg's dream of having a thorium molten salt breeder. Such a thermal breeder requires fissile % to be around 19% U-233 or 235. That is skirting HEU definitions. Add to that an inbuilt fluoride volatility and reprocessing plant and ITAR restrictions alone will mean that Kirk's reactor will never see the light of day outside of the military. A malicious actor could shut the core down, run fluoride volatility to extract all the uranium and let it sit for 12 months so that the U-232 daughter products and their hard gammas decay away. Now you have the beginnings of a nuclear device, and you did not need a research reactor or enrichment cascade. Now granted, this is highly unlikely, as the gammas would mean the decay would be visible from space and radiation monitoring satellites would be able to pick it up in transit. To say nothing of IAEA inspector suspicion due to the reactor being shut down without notice. But again: why go to all that trouble only to leave such a scenario open? I think Alvin Weinberg's dream will not be realised as long as thermal breeding is pursued. Only thermal converting or fast breeding or fast converting will yield the anti-proliferation results inherent to the fuel salt chemistry and reactor system. In addition, we know that there are millions of years of uranium supply available to anyone with a coastline, with seawater adsorption mining. And millions of years of thorium on top of that as well. This means that the raison d'etre of thermal breeding is for naught - fuel supply is _not_ an issue. Fissile startup is _not_ an issue. On the other hand, destruction of higher actinides, and weapons grade plutonium and uranium is an issue. The United States is in violation of Megatons to Megawatts treaty requirements to destroy a few dozen tons of ex-Soviet weapons grade plutonium because it has failed to build a MOX facility at Savannah river. There are legislated restrictions on nuclear power's expansion within the US due to a lack of final plan of spent fuel disposition. A reactor system will need to address these concerns, before addressing the ephemeral issue of fuel supply that we know is a multi-million year prospect. Meanwhile we are awash in cheap fissile: SWUs of 5% U-235 are in massive supply, forcing enrichers to close. Nuclear weapons aging is generating tons of unused fissile material that needs final destruction. I believe that Ed Pheil's MCSFR https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHsljVnY6oI and David LeBlanc's IMSR https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgTgV3Kq49U are the key to solving these problems. The IMSR and MCSFR can burn spent nuclear fuel from light water reactors. The waste of 1 year's spent fuel from an LWR can power 6 IMSRs or MCSFRs. Ed Pheil's MCSFR can itself, through the fuel production process _alone,_ denature weapons grade Pu by mixing it with spent fuel. Put it in the MCSFR for 1 year and run it and that weapons material is destroyed forever. We need to beat these swords into ploughshares, but LFTR is unlikely to be able to do so. Kirk has done the world a service by bringing MSRs back to the fore, but his military entanglements will restrict his contribution to little more than the military sector.",UCUjmCjYul-xC-TplX2mkwJQ,1,UgwIGDtIV-AdXFtUaup4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

It takes metallurgical coal to reduce sand into low grade silicon. Then additional refinement using chemical processing (reagents themselves dependant upon cheap fossil fuels) into solar panel grade polysilicon. http://www.thequartzcorp.com/en/blog/2014/04/28/polysilicon-production/61 This energy intensive, reagent intensive production process is why solar PV is 48 g CO2 / kWh in life cycle emissions as compared to wind turbines, which sit at 12 g CO2 / kWh. Add to that the fact that much of the production, doping, wiring, and panelisation processes happen in China (which uses coal extensively) and you begin to understand that although _the wind and the sun are renewable, the materials to make the machines to capture them are not._ The same thing can be said of wind turbines. http://vaclavsmil.com/wp-content/uploads/15.WINDTURBINE.pdf It takes vast amounts of natural gas furnaces to reduce CaCO3 (chalk or calcium carbonate) into CaO (lime) for cement. It takes metallurgical coal to refine haematite into steel. Vast amounts of petrochemical adhesives, binders, lubricants, waxes, polymers etc. to produce the turbine blades, fairings, wire coatings, lubricated bearing surfaces etc. Again, this is why wind turbines have a CO2 footprint of manufacture even though they produce none during operation. Every energy source, needs energy itself to set up. Right now the growth of wind and solar is fast and cheap _because fossil fuels are fast and cheap._ But the material throughputs, extended to their logical conclusion, raise questions as to their sustainability long term. If a solar panel or wind turbine degrades and needs repowering after 25 years - what will fuel its reproduction, who will remediate the very large and very deep concrete foundations? If the batteries to offset their intermittency need replacement every 20 years, meaning a 100g CO2 / kWh price to be paid for every battery replacement - what will power their production? Thankfully we don't need to reduce emissions intensity by _that_ much. IPCC says that we only need to get electricity down to below 100g CO2 / kWh for the whole system, not 10g CO2 / kWh. But _if we do need emissions that low_ then the only energy source that is practicable is nuclear power. Especially reactors that can recycle and reuse their own fuel, which boosts their energy returned on energy invested from 75:1 to over 2000:1. From 12g CO2 / kWh of today's reactors to less than 0.1g CO2 / kWh. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360544213000492 As for energy conservation and energy efficiency, I must warn that Jevon's paradox is around every corner. The world's energy intensity (amount of energy needed to produce X amount of economic output) has had sustained declines: https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=27032 . And yet energy use is rapidly _increasing_ instead of decreasing. Why? Because if you get more efficient at using energy you can use more of it doing other things. It makes energy cheaper so more people have access to it, instead of a moneyed elite. Now, only a dark green, anti-human Malthusian would argue that cheaper energy is a bad thing. Because cheap energy is needed to lift developing countries out of agrarian poverty, slash and burn agriculture, exploitation of women and war. We should all strive to attain plentiful, cheap, clean energy. Conservation assumes a static world, a world with deepening inequities and demands that the poor stay poor and the rich stay rich. We have only begun to climb the S-curve of the exploitation of the wind and the sun. At these low scales, all growth looks exponential. The question is when the growth turns linear and when the inflection point of stagnation occurs. There are reasons to believe that the inflection will occur sooner, and energy production from wind and solar stagnate faster, given their voracious demands for raw materials compared to hydroelectric dams, geothermal plants, or nuclear power plants, per unit energy. Does that mean we should abandon it? No. But we must be cognizant of that, and keep all options on the table. A 100% renewable goal cannot and will not decarbonise, but it is a handy excuse for driving hydro and nuclear power out of a country, like Germany. Which is now razing forests and villages to mine more coal to back up variable wind and solar. Does that mean that renewables are fig leaf politics masquerading as decarbonisation? Well, no. But the results achieved thus far, put in question the methods used to strive for a clean energy future. It puts into stark relief the efficacy of populist movements like divestment, ""Earth Hour"", anti-pipeline actions (how do you think activists got to the pipeline? Hint: they drove a car there), anti-nuclear, anti-GMO, energy efficiency drives and sweeping promises of an Arcadian idyll powered entirely by ""natural"" energy. Ignorance and romance is why climate targets are being missed. It is why ""more political will"" is not sufficient - we must all begin to think like power system engineers. In the 1970s, when climate change began to be raised as a concern, fossil fuel was 80% of global energy supply. Today, 50 years later, fossil fuels are _still_ 80% of energy supply. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwTiN9enSUY http://environmentalprogress.org/big-news/2017/2/11/german-electricity-was-nearly-10-times-dirtier-than-frances-in-2016 https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy/primary-energy.html",UCUjmCjYul-xC-TplX2mkwJQ,1,UgwIGDtIV-AdXFtUaup4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

I have to admit, it was better back when the conservatives were the ones people ignore. Now I see people attacking Kevin Hart, Ellen DeGeneres, and others. People like Don Lemon being irrational, people wanting to go into the government having nothing else to contribute other than ""impeaching the president"". I don't care whether or not someone likes the president, I do care that these people aren't helping the economy and they're too busy thinking how to take out someone who might be out in 2 years, or being butthurt because of a lost. These arent only people from the Left, these are also people from the Right as well being Numb skulls, like Mitt Romney. So far, I was thinking about it, and came to a conclusion that wanting to side with someone or something because you don't like it is a pretty bad idea (if you read my earlier comment you know I did the same mistake). Solving issues and stuff like that should be done, then looking at which side you land on should be the one you stay until convinced otherwise. Basically, if you want to solve some issues and those ideas lands on head then you're head, and done.

I know the internet has conditioned you into thinking that this is the norm, but I distance myself from that pitfall. I am a firm believer of the dialectic method and I think labeling someone with an ideology is very counterproductive for this very reason. I'll just take your argumentation as you wrote it down, without any presumptions about how you identify politically. This is not where I'm after. I think you make a few valid points. But I would also like to question a few claims you make. I'll start from top to bottom. The claim that Hollywood is presenting a form of identity politics is a valid point, in my opinion. This also goes for your claim about California. Where I disagree however, is that this is a form of extremism. Extremism is something that politically deviates from the status quo, and because these media companies don't function in a vacuum (but in a neoliberal capitalist system) I find it hard to believe that they were able to harness this influence without an enormous base of people who consume their media. Your claim might stem from your own perspective, or the perspective of the group you identify with (again, I won't make assumptions as to what this might be). If you are a left-wing authoritarian for example, the ideas of a conservative person are way more likely to be interpreted as extreme or even unethical. I also don't agree with your claim that these left-leaning media companies control everything that we see or hear. I'd argue the right has been successful in dismantling this paradigm by making use of supply and demand. About your penny story: I see your point, but I still firmly believe the left is on the rise. With the right being deplatformed the void gets filled up with political content that is viable for YouTubes' idea of a business model, again due to supply and demand. You can see the overall time for attention of all political viewers combined as a stagnant and finite pool that can be tapped into by content creators. In a twisted way the attention of the viewer can be seen as a currency. For more information about how this functions I recommend academic papers about the attention regime and I remember the book Netocracy by Alexander Bard also talking about this phenomena. I remember reading a striking essay about the attention regime, but I can't find it right now. If you're interested I could delve deeper for you to dig it up. regards, Michiel",UCTO3YWBArmHd3SEW-_m7CuA,1,UgxqG_2AGyY1x6Zkw354AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

If being something that isn't a Dem. could stop this then I'll take my chances. Also, everyone is tired of these people. I know what you mean by ""the right blowing things out of proportion"" but it's understandable to think so when the top extremist ideologues comes from Democrats in the Higher ups in California, controlling what we watch or hear. With every action there's an equal and opposite reaction, and that's what has come to it, People getting tired of it and now Gen Z are going to more Conservative; the opposite of what you guys want, and it's all because of the insanity that has been left to run around rampantly. Just in case: before you start saying I'm a Nazi, White Suprrmacist, republican, Christian, cis, straight, white, male, i'd advise you to refrain yourself from doing so. It's like those people are trying to create a utopia, but they're ending up in creating a Dystopia. There's a book call Utopia, which talks about a city where it's amazing, but looking into it it turns out it's actually a Dystopia. It seems like these people just want something good that they causing something bad to happen. The left is ""rising"" on Youtube because the Right is getting banned, demonitised, etc. Basically it's not that they're rising, it's more like the right is getting diminished. It's like if there's 100 pennies and 100 quarters, and I start removing quarters, it would seem like the number of pennies are rising but really it's just me artificially taking out the quarters, that's what's been going on for the last 2 years to couple months.

But there are a couple of things I would like to point out: For one, YouTube has a history of content waves. It started out with the atheist community, then it slowly evolved into a new wave we could call the skeptosphere and finally a ""post-skeptosphere"" (if you will) that branched out into anti-SJW channels. (this is a obviously a very bare-bones and limited perspective on the vastly different forms of content the platform classicaly presented, but I try to stay within the sphere of political channels, just for the sake of argument.) This is where we are now, but it is in decline. It is in decline partly due to the shifting prioritization algorithm the platform is pushing and partly due to the add-pocalypse that is in full swing since 2017. What is happening right now is that the left is able to pierce this system for whatever reason and they are doing it with (you can disagree with me) quality content, instead of the same old tactics the right has been using for years. This particular tactic I am talking about involved getting the worst possible representation of the left, reeling it into their filterbubble, blowing it up, and attacking it as if it represents the entire group. There is only so much pandering you can do on this platform before it gets old for the general viewer. And I would argue the political viewer is no exception. Now the left is entering the stage. They have nothing to lose and everything to gain after they got pushed off the platform back in 2016. But now they are doing it with a deep understanding of the pitfals the right has layed bare in their bombardment of YouTube in the past several years. They refrain from the Audre Lorde method of argumentation and instead choose a more distanced and nuanced method that is less easy to meme out of existence. Who knows what the future will bring. But those are my two cents on the matter.",UCTO3YWBArmHd3SEW-_m7CuA,1,UgxqG_2AGyY1x6Zkw354AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

I only really mentioned the way in which the show attempts to bring resolution to conflict to make a point on what SP's core beliefs go on about, the ones I characterized as childlike in nature, not that this is a bad thing of course. I dont really care much about satire preaching solutions at all. I'm only pointing out the fact that what South Park diagnoses as an issue is usually just a minor aspect of a much larger picture. That's why I believe people shouldn't think of South Park as social commentary on a large, complex scale if they truly wanna enjoy the show, because then it just falls flat in comparison with far more insightful pieces on the matter(like say, Bojack Horseman or IASIP). The show works best from an individual standpoint, challenging individual virtues, etc that contradict one's beliefs: takes the piss out of those whose participation in a cause they rule dishonest to their character(something quite simple to make, yet proves entertaining regardless). Not that South Park can't make brilliant points outside of this formula every now and then, but what im saying is they usually revolve around personal integrity more than the systematic structure of it all, you know?(again not necesarilly a bad thing. This is a common occurence in satiric works. South Park just happens to base the whole thing on this principle).

It is in this sense a very good picture of what it means to have a centrist mindset I feel. South Park's philosophy is escentially ""this happens and it's stupid and you're all going on about it in stupid ways fuck you"". Never offering a clear evaluation of the ground in which the issue itself stands, or offering any insight in how to solve it. I think, the most productive way in which to look at south park's brand of commentary is to evaluate the ways in which your cause falls flat in means of general appeal(which is really what the show keeps going on about, despite lacking that self awareness). It can serve as a great point of reference to brand propaganda of your own.

I also dont think South Park has apathetic outlook on justice or that it ridicules activism on itself, but I can see how can you take such a message from their depictions. I think again this issue stems from how simple minded South Park is in its commentary. They're not preoccupied with making much of a hot take on a social issue as they are about ridiculing those whose means of action they deem hypocritical or contraproducing to a cause, and because of that they end up neglecting to adress the bigger picture behind the ordeal.",UCv0NCKCyQRVcC5HAGfQj5UQ,1,UgyJRqct7VzZsKDu5wV4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

I simply studied a bit about the engineering behind cochlear implants - definitely only a limited amount of field usage actually comes back to the lab side of things. It seems strange that medical professionals discourage sign language for patients who don't have that acquired yet. That might be the psychology side of language acquisition rendering that kind of judgment. Everything just seems like this is still a novel treatment finding its footing, even though I believe cochlear implants going back to about 15 years ago were quite successful at getting a resolution that was even able to pick up on music.

The reliability is less about the tech itself and more about the unseen impact on quality of life. Some people do succeed very well using CI to hear speech and sounds, but many still spend years of their life training their brain to understand sound with very limited success. And medical professionals often discourage any form of sign language while learning to hear/speak, so if this doesn’t pan out, a young teen or adult is potentially left with no full language to fall back on. Finally, even with considerable training success with a CI, many still struggle on the same level as an excluded Deaf person in situations that hearing people tend to manage well, such as loud spaces, auditorium classrooms, fast-paced workplaces, and end up using the same accommodations that I would such as an interpreter or CART. So the medical expense of this often ends up being an additional cost on society rather than just going straight to natural language learning and later accommodations.

So if digging it up to burn it as fuel is the best way to do that and spread that precious plant food then so be it.",UCN2FgvsE5JIitrmeiysW1ZA,1,UgzECTlCh2rgEBRkumh4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

In a way, Korben is right: More fossil fuel usage will expedite the mass extinction catastrophe that is already under way. Once, the human population has been severely diminished, the cause of climate change and mass extinction will be removed and the trees will be free to flourish and help bring nature back in to balance. I doubt that’s what the commenter intended, but it’s likely that’s what will happen. Global, human societal collapse is not just a possibility. It’s a likelihood. The best we can do is prepare ourselves and any family and friends who also understand. Trying to convince trolls isn’t a fruitful option, at this point.

To me, however, that kind of logic is irreconcilably alien; it's so dispassionate that it almost seems like apathy. All known life in the universe is at risk, much of it is being destroyed or threatened while we speak, and being an atheist, I can only think that the only mechanism in the universe to determine 'good' and 'bad' is inherent to life, which after all, is the only known force in the universe that has an objective. I can't as easily emphathise with inanimate space debris as I can a human being; one of them can suffer and the other can't. Without meaning offense, saying ""nothing's fair"" occurs to me as a means of denouncing agency and responsibility, because engaging it is too taxing. I feel like, just as Contrapoints highlighted in her video, that kind of attitude erodes quickly when it's put to the test - oil companies very quickly start believing in the immediate threat of rising sea levels when it's their own property that's at stake, and not some paddy farmers in the Pacific. Or, to put a spin on your own analogy, if you were on a roller coaster, and someone did get badly hurt, would you turn to the other passengers and dismiss their panic because ""they knew the risks""? If there was a high chance that roller coaster was on a collision course that would maim or kill everyone onboard, wouldn't you join everyone else in screaming for it to stop before that happens? I don't make a logical decision to panic. I react because I perceive danger, and there's nothing I can do to stop it. Without getting too much into myself, I'm living, voting, buying and politically engaging pretty damn green. I might be living in the last generation on earth who had a chance to do something about it, so I can't put it all into the perspective of a forgone conclusion.

No, majority of the republican parties are not what you just described. You hold your belief so because they do not agree with you. Read up more on what they discuss. I'm going to say something you are going to feel extremely uncomfortable with: the democrats doesn't care about the climate as well. What they care about, both republican and democrats are votes. In the republican case, the politicians refuse to make any changes to policies that might affect industrialists who sponsor them. The democrats want to both appeal to voters such as yourself and those who stand to profit from carbon reduction policies: battery companies, solar panels installers, investors who bet on renewable energies. The republican voters concern about your climate change is that the knee-jerk reaction to climate change might cause even more disruption and potentially economical and environmental damage. An example is Germany whose move to renewable energy was so disastrous they have to build new coal power plant to supplement their production. There's also another pill you might need to swallow about those agreements. They are only agreements. There's no mechanism of enforcement attached. It's like a pinky swear. The core issue can be demonstrate simply: The developed countries want to reduce emission, the developing ones can't give a damn. As long as there's no mechanism to punish those who violate the agreement, it frankly would remain meaningless. The plan is already decade old and barring some sporadic effort, It's a feel good activity to the industrialists so that they can stop the guilt.",UCI3bEN0m5TFdMVSB90SpDoA,1,UgzFJ1UE2zWGs8xLk6l4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

Imagine if you heard that there will be a storm coming, the argument is not about whether or not the storm is real but how much damage would the storm cause and what to do about it. That's the most difficult part, predicting the damage. Most scientists are still debating the extend of the damage and what should be done. Carbon emission reduction is good but we can't expect all country to follow the guideline, especially China, Russia, India. If we take into account per capita, the Gulf and Australia top the chart. You can't just ask these countries to stop using carbon. Even if we use alternatives, the only one that's actually clearly reduce pollution as a whole is nuclear and we know the general consensus on nuclear energy.

Read the research on what happens to human beings in solitary confinement. If you agree, then we have our first building block locked in place. And since we need each other, whether it is for safety, amusement, or help, whatever it is, then we also need to figure out what's right: what won't hurt us or cause us to hate each other, and what's wrong: what will lead to our doom. And here you go, now you have a definition for morality. Morality based on what's right and what's wrong to us as a species at least. Here's your meaning. It's us against the world, it's always been JUST US! But more importantly it's us against the ones who don't care about the rest, and the ones who are too stupid to realize they're being lied to by the media. We can define ourselves through our actions, and if we do not try to stop this or even slow it down then humanity deserves what happens to it. Sartre was right. We are what we do.

He who is true enough to himself will not have an easy life, and will be shunned, deemed ""not-cool', and ridiculed for the audacity of straying away from the herd.

Of course that climate change is real, the problem is that the same thing that sustains us is also harming us.

Technology we would have to research, develop and implement all the while not allowing a whiff of CO2 in the atmosphere.

Senator Inhofe&#39;s campaign should come at no surprise, most of our economy is based around the production of oil and natural gas, it pays for our schools, our roads and is a large source for jobs. God forbid, the alumni center at my college was paid for by Phillips 66 and the football stadium paid for by T. Boone Pickens , hell I even went to the same high school as one of the granddaughters of Love&#39;s Travel Stops (the Love family was distinguished enough as supporters that Trump appeared at their home ). People like these usually have oil in common and have a major influence over the state&#39;s interests, the state wants those tax dollars, and clash with the federal government on policy. Under the Trump administration their have been rollbacks on regulations for drilling new wells, some protections for animals and their procedures for dealing with them have been decreased allowing for more wells to be placed. Federal Policy can have a large impact on the lives of the people here, and of course our legislature reflects that. So we have to ask ourselves is the cost of saving the environment work giving up our economic prosperity worth it? Why of course it fucking is, you just run into the problem of telling those people they no longer have jobs because we have to cut back our oil production. I&#39;ve personally seen it, my dad works in industry, and I&#39;ve noticed the fluctuation of policy influencing the production of oil. And that production of oil trickles down to other industries, namely transportation, but closely the aerospace industry here in Oklahoma. The inception of OPEC led to increased gas prices in the 1970s which eventually led to GM to reducing labor cost, and recently outsourcing its labor and in the process Detroit becoming a barren wasteland. Policy has to walk the line of appeasing both sides ideally, but realistically coming up with a solution that works. But you&#39;ve touched on the fact people are more likely to support things that make them money, they&#39;re interested in that new car because they like shiny things, and I feel I need to re-watch whats wrong with capitalism. <br />As for electric cars the are several misconceptions on their impact. Electric cars are very expensive to produce as of right now, the amount of precious materials required to produce a battery for one of these vehicles is staggering, just the copper alone, but also there is a large environmental cost, the materials have to be mined, shipped and then produced which requires a large amount of energy. The costs put them out of the price range of the average consumer and their intended effect does not meet a large enough population to have an effect. Tesla is not the greatest at this, they hold a monopoly on the market and do not sell extra parts, and good luck trying to fix it Tesla doesn&#39;t want that to happen either, its either send your car back to the factory to be fixed at a rate of $180 dollars an hour or stick your thumb up your butt. Not to mention green cars still rely on energy plants to produce the electricity to charge them, where does that come from? Coal. Really, the better option would be to keep our current cars and maintain them, many older vehicles production impacts on the environment have been recovered, we waste more energy producing newer cars. But this model is hard under capitalism. <br />Older cash for clunkers in effect took running vehicles and disabled them so that you could get a discount on a newer car, that&#39;s the problem, they incentivize the consumer to buy and buy new, not great for smog, but good for the economy (but didn&#39;t have the intended effect). <br />Trump has been successful in stimulating the economy, and that can&#39;t go overlooked, but what is the cost of this short term gain? Well, you&#39;ve covered that. We just face the dilemma of alternatives. What we should be doing is working towards efficiency, and recycling to cut down on our energy requirements. With that being said, if my rambling was even coherent, even though I disagree with these two points I still enjoy your videos and have for a long time, they have in a way connected me to a sharp, engaging and intelligent transwoman, if your autogynephilia video had existed when I was in high school I probably would have transitioned earlier. Anyways, the intro made me weak, you&#39;re prettier than you think (fucking gorgeous actually), please date/(f*ck) me and keep up the good work. <br /> <br />TLDR: <br />Policy has a great impact on state and local economies, have to find middle ground <br />Electric cars aren’t as green as one might think, and expensive to obtain. <br />Natalie is hot.",UChX1UhRsD5V6ut0Cef1HEXw,0,UgxQ7lvr8ea6Y-JFfS14AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

The solution to the problem, it seems, is readily available but unlikely ever to occur within the time frame specified. The problem being that no one will risk economic instability to cut carbon emissions quickly . I think that it is best not to even confront those who deny climate change because there is too little time to worry about whether they understand the necessity of cutting carbon emissions. For example by say presenting subsidies on sustainable energy production as a viable way to create jobs and to lower the US dependence on foreign oil , you could convince people to make some of the changes necessary without ever having to take a position on climate change. As much as I appreciate your excellent video production and the validity of all of your points, I believe that in an age of mass hysteria a more subversive approach is necessary.

We have been taught about global warming in primary school and we have been explained how it works in physics class in high school with extensive proofs of its existence. (the schooling system goes: primary school, high school, uni/college) I have never met a single teacher(other than religious ones) or a person who claimed it a conspiracy theory. It is taken as fact here and anyone who sees it otherwise is deemed an idiot. And we are seen as a ""third world country"" to many US citizens (even thought we are not) while they are not even taught the bare minimum in schools. I know scientists don't have a lot of money, I am becoming one. But you know who does? The governement. And you know where the money goes in the US? To military. And you know how this happens? Because the political system is based upon a document that is hundred of years old, and that US basically has an off version of aristocracy where the president (one person) has an actual power, and where majority of vote has no value. There are no countries here in EU where the president would actually matter and is nothing else but a mascot. The blame lays solely on the citizens of US, because they are not actively fighting revolution of the system. I bet many countries would back such ideas as well. But all the US citizens do is complain and protest things that don't really matter or protest them in a way that I wouldn't want to be a part of even if I full-heartedly believe in it. Protests have shown to be very effective, we have been having mass protests in Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary even Poland and they were all somehow effective. I am from Slovakia and we have been phaving mass protests against the prime minister and a death of a journalist for a year. The prime minister had to step away after just a couple of them and we are still waiting for the results of the murder investigation. But it did have an impact because we did not just complain, we did not shift the blame unto a TV series, we took responsibility as citizens of a country and stood up against something we hated. Change the system in the US and literally all of its problems will be resolved,",UCGx8yaBiZg_jBO2W_8vNRTg,1,UgzyVSF-BaWZSo2xNOV4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

The shot of the moonlit sea is sublime. <br /> At the risk of waxing philosophical, I have the feeling this all comes down to the death of God. Now that we all know (even those who deny it know it in their hearts) that God is dead, the only thing left to do is have as much fun as possible, or to try and expand our knowledge and attempt to become immortal by leaving great works behind. Thus a relatively long-term problem such as global warming is always going to appear unimportant when compared to the most important thing of all: our maximum expansion within our individual lifespan on earth. <br /> I wonder if it might be possible to better link the left to this idea of individual expansion? What if opening our minds and hearts and taking action on all this stuff doesn&#39;t mean we would be holding ourselves back from doing what we really want to do (by not eating meat or using planes) but rather that we would be getting bigger and stronger and smarter? Not austerity but more power... And yet, there will always be the instinct to not let that power be dispersed among the crowd, to retain the right to be the rock star being worshipped on stage... This seems like an unsolvable dichotomy. And perhaps rightly so...<br /> I suppose it comes down to the pleasure principle versus the reality principle. And what makes your videos so strong is that, more than a lot of other YouTubers, you&#39;re prepared to go into the appeal of the pleasure principle and of a certain right-wing energy and world-view, to pay your respects to the Devil as well as make fun of his followers.",UCTnI4v7S6ZdvIvo38N6eXRA,0,Ugwyzpkze4sjKK7S5SB4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

Six of those ten employers were Coal/Oil/Natural Gas companies or a power company that used Coal/Oil/Natural Gas. The town&#39;s government took up two spots on that list, and the final two spots were filled by the town&#39;s single chain grocery store and its single Walmart.

Herbivores do likewise, but with plants. Humans are frugivores, evolved to primarily eat nuts, fruits and starches with the ability to opportunistically engage in carnivory, this is the same for other apes. Recent evolutionary history has seen humans, primarily in Africa and Central America, rely on meat to greater extents but, given the modern day, it's obvious which phoenotype of human is more adaptive. It seems agriculture is universally preferable to hunting, given that modern civilization relies on it, as opposed to hunting. The consumption of meat is essentially an evolutionary left over from a prior era before humans had developed sufficient intellectual capacity to grow food, but that era ended before the species actually adapted to become obligate or primary carnivores. One can demonstrate this by the simple fact that, while humans have the capacity to digest meat, our body is very poor at it and suffers severe detriment from the behavior. The cholesterol regulatory system in humans seems to suggest this insofar as, unlike obligate herbivores, the consumption of cholesterol or saturated fats does not near instantly kill us. However, unlike obligate carnivores, who have robust regulatory perimeters that allow them to consume large amounts of cholesterol and saturated fats without damage or atherosclerosis of the cardiac tissue, humans who engage in carnivory for prolonged periods quickly develop heart disease or other chronic illness caused by increased lipid presence in the bloodstream or keto-acidosis from the lowered PH of the blood that results. For instance, Eskimo populations have experienced extreme mortality rates from heart disease, this seams to be directly caused by their almost exclusively carnivore based diet. Studies show that as the diet of eskimos modernizes their mortality therefrom decrease, providing evidence that even the standard American diet is preferable to their traditional habits. TL;DR: humans are definitionally not carnivores, to the contrary. Further, your writing style, odd invocation of political leanings, and seaming distaste for ""virtue snivelling morality"" (did you mean virtue signalling moralism or snivelling moralism and virtue signalling?) the cognitive capacity that delineates humans from the lower apes and from most animals I would surmise you to be a very stupid person who is personally offended by the notion that some behavior you take basic pleasure in is wrong.

The example they gave was giving up red dead redemption 2 and soy sauce to appease manbearpig on a metaphorical level (with the people of south park being too selfish to even give that up) but its clear that they believe that we need to give up lifestyle choices that have those effects of the environment or else the consequences will be cataclysmic, and they doubt that anyone will. A pretty cynical way to look at it, but not one i particularly disagree with. Humans are suckers for luxury and dont like giving things up. Case in point: the backlash against vegans that you yourself explained perfectly. I use my anaemia as an excuse not to go vegetarian even though i know its better for the environment and a cruel industry that i would rather not support. When really the main reason is I fucking love meat, and my iron levels are just an afterthought. Though i&#39;d go a step further and say that we need to do more than police our lifestyle emissions. We need to do something about industrial emissions. But i&#39;m glad more prominent moderate and conservative voices like South Park&#39;s creators Trey and Matt (who are both pretty centre-right and have a lot of influence on the general public) are changing their tune on climate change.

To the beans and rice comment: you can make that lifestyle tasty as fuck if you do it right, cheap too. Personally I'd do lentils instead of rice and sweet potatoes as well, you can make some incredible yellow curry dal with sweet potatoes, carrots and lentils. Starches in general are incredibly versatile and if you do some experimentation with sauces (or pasta if you can afford the calories in your diet) you can eat an incredibly varied, nutritious and cheap diet that way. Pro tip: throw some unsweetened whole fat coconut milk in there, vegan diets are actually too low fat, often times, make sure to eat nuts, avocados or something with fat if you decide to try the diet. Peanut butter can work as a source of fat on the cheap. On the arteries: Chicken isn't necessarily better for you than red meat, the main indicators of future chronic illness are BMI and cholesterol, both of which you can fuck up with chicken or fish, as both contain exogenous cholesterol (which you should be ingesting 0 of) and saturated fat. (chicken also has a pretty strong feminizing effect on men due to the pthalate content) Red meat is bad for the same reasons but with the addition of much more heme iron, which is also terrible for your heart but don't let that fool you into thinking that chicken or fish not having that means they're ""good"". There's pretty much nothing you get from either that you need or couldn't get from a much healthier plant source. (eggs are worse than meats, also, one yolk is enough to tip you over the FDA maximum RDA for cholesterol, which should, again, be zero, as there is literally no reason to eat cholesterol, but even the standards of the FDA, which are too high, would forbid eating eggs)",UCl-S3G7VcOWsngNK-iu5Oeg,1,Ugy5xhonUPS7pc1wSrV4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

IT is important to note, I am not trying to say veganism is bad or incorrect. So the fact you missed the point shows you have no interest in real discussion of reality, rationalism, or nuance. The paper is showing you can be healthy on all diets if they are restricted backed by exercise. That is if you bothered to read the article at all.

The answer to that question is complex and tied up in a combination of Western ethno-centrism and vast oversimplification. All while ignoring that there _are_ real niches that farm animals have in modern agriculture. There are cultures on this planet that have evolved to rely in large part or in full on animal products. Mongols on the steppes. Eskimos above the frost line catching fish and seals. In the mountains of Nepal where growing space is at a premium but goats can forage on steep cliffs. Even the Native Americans raising bison would do this, over settling down and growing grains. Why? This is because these cultures have survived and thrived by raising grazing animals for manure (fuel), meat, milk and mobility. They convert otherwise worthless grasslands and indigestible fibers on mountain and hillsides into useful animal products. Or in the case of fishing cultures, exploiting otherwise worthless seawater by catching fish. Dr Sarah Taber has a short twitter thread explaining how these niches exist. And why just saying ""just go vegan"" may have impacts beyond a simple emissions reduction - we would have to find a way to feed these cultures - hundreds of thousands of people - on arable land that was previously unexploited. https://twitter.com/SarahTaber_bww/status/1006363772838170629 Does this mean that we should continue to grow ruminants on land that has a surplus of water but limited scope for area growth? Well, no. People _should_ be trying to farm chickens instead of ruminants and so free up arable land that does have water surplus. The manure can be used as fertiliser and grains and food waste that would otherwise go to landfill could instead feed chickens. As for cultures still living in areas of low water but surplus in area then ruminants should not be eliminated solely on principles of emissions reduction.

And in some cases, after certain industries left developping countries to produce, fore example, in Europe because the customers pushed for it, local communities were left with a massive unemployment issue, a rise in poverty and in even more precarious jobs like prostitution.

How can I say to developing countries to choose green while they focus on just getting by and trying to reach similar living standards as us. We would probably collectively have to accept some sort of living standards decrease to solve this to be this globally. This problem will no doubt bring conflict and political turmoil. In France for example currently there are protest against fuel tax rises which could be one of the concrete problem solving methods but are clearly really unpopular. <br /><br />Limiting the emission of top 100 polluting corporations, which are mostly fossil fuel companies, means we would have to solve energy requirements with renewable energy and while I see it as possible to some extent there are many industries that I can&#39;t see it to apply such as defense/war and heavy transportation. Also the globally energy question is also inherently political to many nations as they form a fossil fuels form large parts of economy. In their national self interest using fossil fuel is good and brings them wealth. Thus any serious disruption to global state of order is national interest question. I think these countries will pay lip service to climate agreements but when push comes to shove they won&#39;t disrupt their source of wealth. <br /><br />Main problem I see is that as climate change is a global problem we will need global solutions but they are notoriously hard to do. We would need countries to act against majorly their self interest on the sort term so we would need major economic or political motivators to ensure this. Economic motivators will be hard to do since even as little or simple as some foreign aid can be really unpopular and that is only if rich nations even want to commit some economic self harm in revolutionizing their industries and then helping less well of nations. And the political motivations would of course in this case be forceful and lead to conflict, disagreement and possible war. <br /><br />The nations of the world would have to make really unpopular decisions and a method to enforce them. This enforcement would have to have actual teeth compared to most international organizations like UN. Sadly this will be impossible peacefully in current state of affairs as nations won&#39;t give any of their rights to enforce some global treaty which will only benefit them in the future and not to the present.

Esselstyn with his minute sample size of cardiovascular patients, half of which abandoned the study. Cambell's cancer-ridden vegan rats (whose cancer was arificially induced with aphlatoxin and not caused by animal protein) which all died of malnutrition so quickly that the tumors didn't have time to kill them. ""Norway under Nazi occupation didn't eat any meat, and they stopped dying of heart disease!"" Except that they also ate less of everything else, including fruit, vegetables, grains, oils etc. Because you know, Nazis conquering your country results in them taking all your shit. Oh and they also died in droves of cold and tuberculosis, because the Germans were also taking all of their coal. This happened especially to the elderly, who are most at risk of heart disease and cancer anyway, so naturally all of them dying of infections and hunger brings down the death rates from cancer/heart disease! ""But all studies on current vegans show them to be more healthy than omnivores!"" No shit Sherlock! Self-selecting sample: Everyone whose health deteriorates due to veganism stops being vegan. Everybody whose health improves stays vegan. Not to mention that the willingness to drastically alter life-style choices in the name health is going to improve your health no matter what kind of diet you eat, or the fact that being informed about health is usually highly correlated with better socioeconomic status, which is also a strong predictor of good health. That's why people who eat organic are so much healthier: Organic food is a moronic fad, arising from a scientifically illiterate fear of pesticides and GMOs. It's just that the people who can afford to pay ridiculously inflated prices for food can also afford to live a healthier lifestyle generally, not to mention having better health insurance. I am in no way ""extrapolating esoteric shit"" good sir, the source I provided cites archival data to show massively worsened health outcomes, and then proceeds to show that they can only be explained by drastic reductions in animal product consumption, which were caused by a push towards autarchy. Unlike Norway, a frequently cited vegan propaganda piece, Germany had far fewer other factors that could have drastically increased mortality. The Jewish population was tiny, so their suffering couldn't have been the chief cause of worse average health outcomes. The worst affected group, by far, were children aged 7-15, so harsher working conditions caused by the dissolution of labor unions couldn't have been the main cause. Unemployment decreased, so it wasn't the Depression. Their country wasn't under occupation, being drained of all it had, it was experiencing a sizeable (if obviosuly unsustainable) economic boom due to massive borrowing and armament expenditures. People had money. People had heating. People had plant foods. People had everything BUT animal products, and health outcomes deteriorated SEVERELY.",UC6VUyQYCfT4bpPdme7OH8CA,1,Ugzr4TV6pl-P-yR86sl4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

It doesn't matter if it's called ""Cotton Candy Collectivism"" (which is what all the Marxists are actually preaching, looks GREAT on paper, the reality/execution... not so much), this idealism presides in this arena that COLLECTIVISM and the MEANS OF PRODUCTION will END global warming. You can keep going back to this strawman that I'm using the wrong terms, that there AREN'T statues devoted to him all over Russia, that he isn't a guiding force (actually used as a front/propaganda precisely because of its absolute and total closed-system rose-colored glasses idealism) to justify the USSR's methods and means: there are a lot of idealists here who call themselves Marxists and are using the wrong tools for the job. You have NOT convinced me AT ALL that the means of production will be the thing that SAVES THE WORLD. It certainly will not stop the Polar ice sheets from melting. But at least if people stop breeding long enough for the planet to catch its breath, MAYBE we won't be fighting over the carcasses of humans for sustenance for at least another 30 seconds. Maybe conditions won't be The Walking Dead come to life for at least another minute and a half. But Marxists contend that what I am saying is ILLOGICAL and WILL NOT WORK, but THE MEANS OF PRODUCTION will. That's like saying the snozzberry flavored wallpaper in Willy Wonka will save us all. It's about as logical as that. That's not to say I don't want workers to have rights and to lead a high quality of life. Of course I do. But it's not exactly going to save the polar bears overnight, is it? You want corporations to be worker-owned and for people to be personally empowered through collective acts. Okay... but it doesn't happen overnight. If you set up fair systems that are good for the environment, how exactly are you going to do that? Simply making the decision to NOT HAVE CHILDREN is the single more fool-proof, 100% FREE, definitive way to guarantee 100% that you are doing something benevolent for the environment and habitat for other species/humans. You can do all the other stuff- recycle, be vegan and/or local/sustainable, etc, never eat a GMO food again in your life, don't take cars or planes: and it will still pale in comparison to NOT HAVING CHILDREN. Period. End of story. The end. Do all that other stuff too if you want, knock yourself out: but the facts remain- collectivists have their head up their ass spending years screaming ""Not my president"" at a building and passing talking sticks around a circle and they think that's PROGRESS. It's not. It does nothing. I am quite cynical about what, if anything was achieved by Occupy Wall Street and ""taking up public space""- to what end did that solve? An FBI file for the protestors and totally being disbanded. The same with Anonymous, any other ""collectivist/hacktivist/whateverist bullshit. It did nothing to help the environment. It did nothing but put a bunch of people in jail and censor them further. Not saying their hearts weren't in the right place, but all that time spent protesting in the wrong place and still making babies might have been a tad misguided. Meanwhile, say bye-bye to 20,000-40,000 species every year since then and I STILL see crunchy Vegans and Marxists and stupid ""well intentioned"" secular humanists fighting for the right to wear patchwork quilt bell bottoms and patting themselves on the back thinking they've instigated real change while they continue to blame the big bad corporations even though I NEVER EVER heard about global warming from any of you collectivists for decades, but since you can't get your hands around the all-consuming ""civil rights"" anymore (well, okay, there's abortion/pro-choice, but really, you have had environment at the bottom of your lists for decades now, and saying that the decision to not have children is wrong and bad and that all the blame goes on corporations- which, keep in mind, are people, made by people, producing goods for people- and the collectivists don't see anything wrong at all with continuing to pop babies out of their uteruses like there's no tomorrow and yelling at buildings that Trump is not their president - not only that, I'm racist and a eugenicist if I think it's stupid, selfish, and totally immoral to bring a child into this utterly immoral shit show of a world. This is why collective idealists are totally infuriating. You think you've actually GAINED something with civil rights while all around you the world burned. Wrong focus. But can the left get their ducks in a row, ever, and accomplish anything other than wasting oxygen? No. Nope. No-no. Because collectivist priorities are completely screwy.

Communism wasn't invented by Marx, and it wasn't put in practice by the USSR, can we move from there already? I'm not even a marxist, and you keep trying to put me in your imaginary corner. Even if you want to keep believing that, you can't ignore the kind of atrocious dictatorships that operate under capitalism, because of capitalism, all over the world. And you can't ignore that a big reason those socialist dictatorships formed in the first place was to fight external attacks. Sure, it's awful to live in a police state, being controlled all the time, that doesn't happen with the NSA and ICE, right? Or private prisons, wtf? The assassination attempts to Fidel Castro are not a secret, for instance, or the failed invasion to Cuba. Or the constant propaganda broadcasted to Cuba from Miami, or the CIA agents all over the world intervening with every other government in the world. Since you hate dictatorships so much, maybe you can tell me how was the one in my country wasn't so bad, being backed up by the USA, capitalist and all. I mean, death flights must be tolerable if it is to keep people under slave wages and maintain the sacred social order, and benefit imperialism in the process. It's funny that you think that Russians are somehow the only government responsible for irradiating their population (never mind that the Chernobyl area was closed and people moved). But I kind of remember some concerns about the California fires in connection to a Santa Susana or something like that. And we already forgot Fukushima, it seems. (MK-Ultra?) Those commulists are just the worst. And there again, oh look at you, fighting for freedom, you country is so proud of you. Too bad you forget to define freedom. Most people in the capitalist world can't even unionize, they can leave the country theoretically, but don't have the means, they are free to sell themselves or die, are trapped in life long debts, won't ever attain higher education, many are functionally illiterate, or don't even have a place to sleep at night. Is that freedom? Do you want to know what is cognitive dissonance? Cognitive dissonance is when you keep trying to label someone with the wrong tag, and it keeps failing, and you can't see it, and keep doing it, over and over again, not understanding what's wrong.

We've had capitalism for at most 4 centuries (depending on how you count), but somehow it's the only system that accounts for human nature, never mind other systems have lasted millennia. Also never mind that solidarity is actually shown to be a natural tendency even in animals, or that most people when in small groups tend to share and cooperate. Humans are the only animal that domesticated itself. But somehow, I have to believe that the only people who can see the true nature of humans are individualists, people who can't even see society?

Corporations are notoriously sociopathic and they make decisions based on short term values for shareholders. This is natural property of capitalism, because if you look too far into the future sacrificing short term profits, your competition will not do that. That goes hand in hand with: 2. Lobbying against environmental regulations. Look, I grew up in post socialist country, I know how bad policies and totalitarian government can fuck nature just as the same as the worst capitalist can(just look at Chernobyl and what a fuckup that was). The difference is that in non-capitalist system is the fact that you will fuck up nature only if you are incompetent, evil or ideologically brainwashed(e.g. ""We need to produce as much electricity as dirty imperialists, therefore we will use more coal""), but other than that there is no incentive for you to not focus on long term goals, even if they are not profitable in near future, as there is no competition you have to fight. In capitalism, you are forced to take shortcuts, be dick to nature, lobby against anything that can hurt your profits and disregard any long term goals.

If it is processed in certain ways (all meat really, if processed) has been linked to increased cancer risk (the one you take from the butcher is not processed, obviously). Also, eating less meat in general could be good especially for Americans. Since deregulation in the sector there permits you to eat animals treated intensively with antibiotics, which could make you develop a tolerance for them. This is very bad, and it is thus a forbidden practice in Europe, but not in America. On the environmental side of things, red meat comes from ruminants, which are generally very big animals, consume a lot of food, necessitate of a lot of space to live and grow (thus inciting the practice of deforestation) and produce an enormous amount of greenhouse gas, so it makes sense to stop eating them even if you're still eating meat.",UCoWkN3eDehqHuMAdJXMAWDw,1,Ugw7KiOdtylGpE1n6g14AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

I'm not in favour of a completely socialist economy, but I think capitalism needs the chains of some socialist measures in order to function as it was intended.The problem isn't capitalism in and of itself; it's the laissez-faire attitudes that many of those in charge of industries hold, and the lack of regulation that they sometimes desire. I say sometimes, because at least in my country, corporations have started lobbying for regulation. You see, the problem with a lack of regulation is that if you, as a corporation, invest in better production and better environmental measures, then that is revenue you lose that your competition does not lose. Meaning your competition makes more money (by losing less), which is attractive to shareholders. By having globally consistent regulation in place that forces corporations to lose this money on environmental measures, corporations that willingly do this no longer lose more than corporations who don't, which makes goodwill measures from corporations no longer a financial death sentence. Proper regulation can help corporations achieve the environmentally friendlier measures that many of them actually wish to pursue but cannot afford; it can keep 'green' companies competitive in the market.",UCTzgY-DUj1fZPweZqPnYSCQ,1,UgwI7N-qXnnDlSsD33B4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

Whether or not you believe the literal truth or metaphorical parables of the bible, it is interesting on a psychological level to ponder the existence of a great power - whether natural, supernatural or otherwise, wiping out a species because it had degraded itself so much and had devolved so much into rapid-fire irrelevance and danger to themselves and others that it was a necessary evil to drown them like kittens in a great deluge.

To say that you're ""dead sure"" about anything in that regard is quite presumptive. If you can make good consumer choices, good for you. To be so prescriptive about it rings a tad arrogant and privileged. Anyway, there's small, and then there's atomized. In order to do the things you're suggesting, there needs to at least be the physical infrastructure to support it, which requires a municipal level of planning at a minimum. To give an example, I used to live in on of those poorly planned suburban neighborhoods where the roads were all tree structure and no grid structure. I didn't choose to live there, but my parents still do since they can't afford to move. Getting to the nearest grocery store requires a fifteen minute drive. Walking to the grocery store is an hour in one direction. This has nothing to do with the crow's eye distance, and everything to do with that the civil infrastructure was built prioritizing drivability over all other alternatives. This prioritizing of driving is also why there are literally no bus lines out there and work was a 45 minute drive. Due to work, I've since moved to another part of the country. Where I live now is very small scale and walkable. The streets are primarily grid structured, and where there are tree structures, there are also little shortcuts. There are multiple bus lines that actually go out to my apartment, and I take the bus (no cost) everyday. On my way home, I can take a different route and swing by the grocery store between the bus stop and the short cut to the back end of my apartment complex. This falls in line with some of your suggestions, but, again, I can only do this because the physical infrastructure was built specifically to make this a feasible option. I'm not saying your atomized approach can't be part of the solution, but it is inadequate in regards to being *the* solution.",UC5HV0AMeYXRxyFqRBxWkgNQ,1,UgwI7N-qXnnDlSsD33B4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

Capitalism is deeply interrelated with the way we consume. It’s not about not consuming, but how you consumed. Where I live it was difficult, just a couple years ago, to buy local healthy and affordable products of any kind, but the more people with a little more money than me was making small better choices buying at the smaller local stores, the more affordable options are now becoming available. We might not be able to afford a electrical car, but we can make a choice of once in a while take a walk instead.

We may not get all of our toys, but we won't die off if we suddenly stopped using fossil fuels in place of renewables. Current production rates(internal external) are somewhat dependant on fossil fuels(they are not required it's just more efficient for one farmer and a tractor to till a whole field then a bunch of people on smaller renewables think hand labor but both are perfectly capable of doing so in the same time frame one would wrequire more labor than the other). Of course, you're probably going to argue that we need cars and trucks to move stuff around. Which is a dishonest argument. Humans aren't retarded babies. We'd find a way to adapt to the change and within a relatively short time frame, things will be back to ""normal."" Even if we now have to sail by wind power alone. Of course with the change in reliance, there will inevitably be innovation in the renewable sector and it will began to approach production levels of fossil-based systems.

It doesn’t matter if you’re going to a co-op on the corner to buy your sustainable, locally-sourced organic broccoli or if you’re buying it in Target and its GMO. Your choice to not breed is still the single best thing you can do as an individual consumer for the world. You will not cease being a consumer if everything suddenly becomes socialist or communist. You still need to eat. You still need to shit. You still need people to provide the food you need to eat and people to work in sanitation to take care of all the shit you produce as a human being. Multiply that by 7.6 billion and growing. The means of production doesn’t mean shit when people are replicating themselves to the tune of ***10,000 babies born every hour***. It’s simple fourth grade mathematics: Too many people + not enough resources = environmental destruction. Being a vegan pales in comparison to just not having a child. Having one less child reduces 58.6 metric tons of waste. Being a vegan doesn’t even get to one metric ton. The means of production as the solution to global warming is not only idealistic, its ridiculous. It negates human biology. It negates the actual, physical space just one human needs to survive. It negates the gallons of water needed just to make whatever food you eat! Even if it’s vegan organic crops, even those have been severely detrimental to existence. Have you read about what the virtuous yoga studio heads in Los Angeles and what their wholesome, virtuous vegan diets are doing to Brazil? There are whole towns in Brazil that are on fire right now because of Quinoa production!! That’s just one crop that the vegans think they’re helping the planet with so much. It has been completely detrimental to Brazilian agriculture. This is simple mathematics. It has nothing to do with the means of production. It has to do with too many people + ever-diminishing resources = destruction of the planet. Please learn about biodiversity and habitat destruction before you go on and on about your pie in the sky, naive POLITICAL ideologies. You still gotta shit! You can’t wipe your ass with the means of production... 😂😂😂 Do you know how much waste is produced simply from having a child who needs to wear diapers???? Do you know what having one baby alone does to the environment? Forget them growing up and being an adult creating endless waste for a minute, , just think about the waste produced from ages zero to eight months?! You socialists /communists are having the wrong discussion. Look at China, a communist country. It has no workers rights, I don’t see anyone who is taking charge of the means of production collectively other than what looks like to me like just another capitalist model —-but without labor laws. So it’s even worse. Capitalism and communism are two sides of the same coin. They’re idealogically very similar , albeit at extreme opposites. But they both tend to cause massive human suffering. Communists in the east are putting together the objects that you choose to purchase in the west. But instead of being allowed to have workers rights, they have none. You can’t tell me you don’t have at least one object in your home that is imprinted with a Made In China stamp. I’m willing to bet it’s much more than just one object. Don’t tell me you’re some virtuous hippy living in a yurt that you built from sustainable timber in the middle of nowhere.

But the fascist types dislike Capitalism because its hierarchy is not rigid _enough._ Racial minorities, women, LGBT's, immigrants, etc., can still succeed and rise in the capitalist hierarchy, no matter how unlikely it is. The far right types want to eliminate _that._ They promise social programs to their own race because they want them in a higher social strata than their chosen underclass. But they don't actually care about their well-being, just their relative position. And, if we're being honest, they're often the same people.

What I meant was that a lot of mainstream talking points of the American right are viewed as strange in Europe, even in right-wing circles. It is still pretty much unthinkable for a mainstream politician to argue that climate change isn't real. People are way less prone to defend candidates with scandals. Conspiracy theories are not as nearly regarded as valid talking points in political discussions as they seem to be in the US. The idea of guns being easily purchased while mass shootings are commonplace has us raising our eyebrows. I could not cite you any European country where the Bible still does have its place in the political discourse.

It just seems to come off as coming from somebody who has never had to support themselves. It also seems to come from somebody who lacks any empathy. Since you're so willing to risk other people's livelihoods too support a fake political agenda. To implement laws that you have demonstrated you are completely unwilling to follow by blocking off highways. All at the same time virtue signaling using a device that's probably 90% of your carbon footprint.

A). Firstly, what the fuck dude? You first decry ExctinctionRebellion"" actions and suggest them to ""Get a real job and make CO2 scrubbers and solar panels."" Then when ""ExtinctionRebellion"" said that they would if they could. You mock them for wanting to do so. What the fuck? Also, what ""ExtinctionRebellion"" is trying to do is spread awareness about global warming, installing solarpanels and such will not do that. Also, you kinda sound like an asshole(no offense). I'm not saying you are an asshole, but you sound like one. Try to speak differently and not so crassly to avoid that perception. I have that problem too, i've offended many people just in the way I talk. The way you talk is just as important as what you're saying. B). (Ok, im probably going to make a lot more spelling mistakes because my comment was deleted right when i was trying to post it, so i'm typing this ludicrously long comment for the second time, and honestly it's torturous. Why am I doing this.) Why? Why are you taking the stance that you're taking? How are you benefiting from taking that stance and saying what you're saying? You suggest that ""ExtinctionRebellion"" work on solar panels and CO2 scrubbers. Then when ""ExtinctionRebellion"" said that they want to but can't. You deny solar panels and CO2 scrubbers (things that you suggested to ""ExtinctionRebellion in the first place) as possible solutions. By saying ""You will never convince people to make sacrifices unless you provide an actual working alternative."" and not denying climate change, you are implying that you believe in climate change and that something needs to be done about it. However, you never suggested any alternative solutions or contributed to the larger discussion outside of basically saying ""you're actions don't mean shit and i dont believe you"". Again, this kinda makes you sound like an asshole. A way you can avoid that is by again, speaking differently. Or also suggesting alternative solutions and giving more constructive comments. In your own words, ""You will never convince people to make sacrifices unless you provide an actual working alternative."", I don't see you providing any alternative solutions in your comment. C). (Ok, I admit this last one is a bit personal, but i'm a bit passionate about this subject, sorry.) I disagree with your viewpoint, I believe that solar panels, CO2 scrubbers, hydroelectric turbines and the like are completely practical and possible solutions to reduce our carbon footprint. The only reason why we aren't using them more is because companies are unwilling to spend the little bit more of money to convert to alternative fuel sources. It is much more profitable for them to keep on tapping on the depleting fossil fuel reservoirs instead of spending a little bit more money (which they have excess amounts more of by the way) to convert to alternatives. It's the same reason why we americans are still using the goddamn piece of shit imperial measurement system instead of converting to the much better metric system (as an aspiring engineer, i'm not happy). These companies will only switch to alternatives when they completely run out of fossil fuels (because then there'll be no more profit made from them because they dont exist anymore) Let's compare the processes of setting up and oil rig and setting up a solar panel array or hydroelectric turbine. Before you actually install an oil rig, you have to hire geologists and other scientists to scope out an area and find possible oil reservoirs. Then you have to test those areas to see if they actually do have oil. Then you can start building. You have to dig that big fucking hole down, then you have to do all the piping, then you have to add seals to the pipes, pressure valves, gauges to know where the pressure's at, workers to maintain those valves, etc. Then you can finally build that big, hulking goddamn rig. As you can probably guess, solars and such are much easier. Find free space, install the solar fixtures, do some wiring, send that wiring back to a processing facility. Much cheaper to build and maintain, people are just unwilling to spend the small amount of money to convert as it wouldnt be as profitable to keep on riding on the backs of the preexisting oil rigs.

Not Al Gore. Not the guy who owns a private plane, has a massive residence, takes tens of thousands of dollars in speaking fees to offer an apocalyptic viewpoint, some Green pap about renewables, and then flies back to his high-energy American lifestyle. I hope Al Gore chokes on his jet plane exhaust, because the planet sure as hell is. I would say that Al Gore&#39;s hypocrisy and his profiteering off of &quot;awareness campaigns&quot; have done more damage to the climate cause than advanced it.<br /><br />Dr James Hansen has raised the need for unilateral action on climate change, irrespective of a globalised carbon trading &quot;market&quot; by pushing for carbon fee and dividend. His supporters have put together a citizens climate lobby for legislated CFD that would provide an incentive for people to switch away from fossil fuels, and that does not require global agreements all too easily scuttled by commodity price cycles: <a href=""https://citizensclimatelobby.org/"">https://citizensclimatelobby.org/</a> He, in conjunction with other climate scientists like Barry Brook, Ken Caldeira and Kerry Emanuel - all highly cited and lauded people, has put forth genuine solutions for breaking this log jam. Promoting the secondary benefits of decarbonising, like avoiding 7 million annual deaths from combustion particulates. Promoting GMOs that are less fertiliser and water intensive and can use no-till farming that would otherwise lead to greenhouse gas outflows from agriculture. Promoting nuclear power that has historically been the powerhouse behind decarbonisation of economies like Japan, France, Sweden and Canada. (And now China, UAE, Korea). <br /><br />This sermonising video does little to advance the conversation of how we decarbonise our economies. It is in fact a repetition of the same tired conversation that has led us to this entrenched stalemate and has destroyed any sensible dialogue we could have about climate change. Discussing <i>whether or not climate change exists</i> when it is used by deniers to stonewall conversations about <i>solutions</i> is as harmful as climate change deniers themselves. You are lowering yourself to their level.<br /><br />Climate deniers <i>love</i> to talk about &quot;the science&quot;. They would love to debate the validity of the hockey stick curve, RCP 2.6, the Gulf Stream, the temperature record. There&#39;s an entire website for it called <a href=""http://thegwpf.org/"">theGWPF.org</a> (&quot;The Global Warming Policy Foundation&quot;). The problem with trying to debate on their level is that they will bring you down and beat you with experience.<br /><br />What we <i>should</i> be talking about instead, and what can break the logjam between conservatives and liberals, is:<br />- The sensitivity of our economies to commodity price fluctuations in coal, oil and gas. The OPEC cartel proved in the 60s that they could crash the global economy by turning off the taps in the Middle East. We cannot allow foreign commodities to dictate domestic economic activity.<br />- Corollary to this, domestic trade surpluses and deficits are due in large part to the cost of energy. We need to make clean energy cheaper than coal, oil, and gas, and as reliable and as portable. The industries that grow to displace them will employ our future generations and massive R&amp;D needs to start today<br />- That we spend billions of dollars in healthcare costs due to asthma and other respiratory conditions brought on by fossil fuel particulates. Fossil fuels have funded our economic growth since the Industrial revolution but now we need a cleaner alternative and to eliminate that pollution brake on health and prosperity<br /><br />Do NOT engage with their denialism. Engage instead with their principles of growth and prosperity. Sidestep the science and talk instead about post-carbon.<br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwTiN9enSUY"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwTiN9enSUY</a><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1f4BKsFrCA"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1f4BKsFrCA</a><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CBuRga5xxk"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CBuRga5xxk</a><br /><br />Anyway, let us go forth and make war upon the sea.",UCUjmCjYul-xC-TplX2mkwJQ,0,Ugy363vmG7-sB0GhBr54AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

The self-revolutionising capacity of capitalism can be attributed, if David Graeber is to be believed, to its ability to sustain a state of mind in those who live under it that capitalism has an end. This was the case in the development of damaging bubbles in newly industrialised Britain, Holand and France, where capitalism was assumed to exist forever, and, consequently, irrevocably damaged and almost destroyed their monarchies. This was also the case during the Cold War, where the possibility of being replaced by a Soviet-style &quot;degenerated workers&#39; state&quot; strengthened capitalism around the world. Capitalism will use climate change as a way to continue itself, maintaining the system of inequality while claiming to be a force for good. The large opportunities to be had in the development of renewable energy reveals how government action towards the expansion of the energy industry is directed towards the interests of Capital, not away from it.<br /><br />What the Americans, and the people of the world, need to be careful of in the pursuit of a more equitable economic system is not to treat the voices of the scores of individuals who wish to abandon capitalism as a legitimate show of movement away from Capital, for they make the strongest case for capitalism in the minds of the sedentary public. Rather, they must understand that capitalism has answers to the problems of climate change, but that these answers do not care for those who cannot, would not or do not (want to) join capitalism&#39;s rhetoric involving &quot;equal opportunity&quot; and the &quot;free-market&quot; metaphor.",UCM1kTZKa60aFz2W-QLDZmbg,0,Ugx_j7hSQbVTxbalKjt4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

The amount of oil the U.S. is in possession of would actually kill all of us if we attempted to burn it all, or even most of it (not to mention we got a lot of it from countries we shouldn&#39;t have fucked with in the first place). <br />Our economy itself is actually fully ready to go mainly renewable. In fact, we&#39;ve been discovering more and more ways to REVERSE the effects of climate change. Once abandoned trash dumps are being revisited and used to recycle into clothing, technology, and more. The black forrest in Germany has been revitalized to be as lush as it was in the 1800&#39;s. More trees grow under the paper industry than they would otherwise, and even if this weren&#39;t the case (which it is), the flash drive has saved more trees than greenpeace ever has. <br />We&#39;re AWARE climate change is an issue, it&#39;s common knowledge, it&#39;s taught in schools, and U.S.A. civilians are prepared to go renewable .

I don't blame you for seeing some oblivious vegans and thinking it's more self-serving, but it's good to address the science of the issue logically even if you dislike the advocates personally. The world isn't going vegan overnight no matter what so it's not like there'd be that much of a difference in how many animals go to waste (a lot do already), one of the bigger goals is reducing the forced breeding gradually. Remember that livestock animals are mostly artificially bred to have traits that cause them suffering throughout their lives, taking up land that natural wildlife would have needed and harming their ecosystems. Your soy argument is particularly misguided since the vast majority of soy is used to feed livestock, veganism would actually reduce the amount of land needed for growing plants. Local farmers aren't the enemy at all, what's worse is government meat subsidies and the meat propaganda we're all exposed to on a daily basis.

Due to the eradication of apex predators in many areas, their populations are out of control. I live in Colorado, and I literally don’t go a day without seeing at least one fresh dead deer on the side of the road (which, by the way, you are totally allowed and able to take for yourself and eat. Just gotta call animal control and let them know. Also don’t take it if it’s obviously been sitting there dead for hours lol). They’re everywhere, and they can be pretty destructive. It’s also causing horrible diseases to spread through their herds like wildfire and cause them to suffer; and these diseases can potentially be passed onto livestock. If people hunt for their meat, there’s really nothing but benefit from it. You’ll know exactly where your meat came from, you won’t be supporting the meat industry, and you’ll be helping to deal with a pretty significant overpopulation issue. If you were to take down an animal affected by a disease, you will usually get a new tag so you can try again for clean meat. Most hunting supplies can be reused for years, and utilized for other things outside of hunting. You can take the meat to a game processor, or you can process it yourself (it’s wise to get it tested if you do this, though). For the price of these things and a few hunting tags, you can easily fill a freezer, if not multiple.

"" No, the only thing they both have over you is that they have better tanks, China has a slightly better navy and Russia has a slightly better artillery. In terms of combat aircraft, USA trumps both by a long shot, it has a lot more active manpower than Russia, much more warheads than China, much more and better armored vehicles and drones, etc. Do you think China and Russia don't have dated equipment? It's practically impossible for any country to invade the US right now. I don't think you understand what invading the US, a country that's completely isolated from all other superpowers, has that many warheads and a military that is that powerful entails. You can't simply take your ships across the ocean and attack a superpower with a stronger army than you and more nukes than you. Not that it matters anyway, since there is absolutely no reason any of these two countries would ever attempt to directly invade the US. Not just because it would be tactical suicide, but also because it would be financial suicide as well, especially for China. And Russia would be left awfully vulnerable to a counterattack by Europe, which would probably side with the US in this conflict, seeing as Russia has been a bitch to the EU lately, and if Russia tried to concentrate their forces against the US, invading Russia would be equivalent to just walking right in. All that is assuming nukes aren't a thing of course, because they've completely changed war in the modern era.

He used veganism as one of a few examples, the other ones being not drinking or not believing in God. He pointed out that there are people who fit the asshole atheist stereotype to a T and I've certainly come across holier than thou vegans or people who are ""above the influence."" He doesn't deny that they exist or that any arguments that you make about drinking, God, or veganism is because of this knee-jerk reaction.

They are a very common part of history and direct action is much more realistic than the capitalist class wants it to seem. Of course they want us convinced that their power is an inevitability, and the best option- they don't want to part with their capital and their positions at the top.

Ice melts when its hot, ¿que si? But where does that ice go? Thats right, the ocean. Because that ice goes to the ocean in liquid form, sea levels rise, wreaking havoc on islands and coastal cities like Tijuana and Miami. Thats a problem because then, you have major refugee crisis and millions of deaths. Finally, you have worldwide drought. Because its hot, rain won’t be able to travel far from the sea, raining down on coastal areas and not making it to hot places like the deserts or the midwest of the U.S. Because of that, you’d have another, albeit smaller refugee crisis.

In the 70's, oil companies confronted with the facts that burning fossil fuels will certainly have disastrous effects on the climate and soon, purposefully not only chose to ignore that but set up campaigns to convince people climate change isn't real and certainly not man-made, just so they could keep making more money. I mean, capitalism pushes towards that mostly, but for these actions, derogatory words such as disgusting capitalist pigs and absolute sociopaths deserving of a painful death, are not enough. One thing we could and should do is seize ALL the profits that oil companies have made since they were made aware of the problem of climate change (it's a fuckton) and use all of that money to do everything we can to halt and revert climate change. At the very least. I am still also advocating for the painful, public death of the people responsible.

Even if climate change doesn&#39;t ruin a harvest outright with temperature fluctuations that cause vines to bud early and be killed off by a late frost (2017) or with hailstorms that destroy entire crops (2018), it will still make for less and worse alcohol. Two thirds of wine regions are projected to be agriculturally or commercially nonviable by 2020! <br /> <br />If you care about literally anything on this dumb earth, there&#39;s a good chance that it&#39;ll be ruined in whole or in part by climate change.

With cognac especially, I've read that the optimal alcohol yield for the grapes is six or seven percent, and many producers have complained publicly about how that's becoming difficult to guarantee year to year. That's a big part of why cognac prices, even among the Big Four, have risen sharply and Hennessy has had to blow through its reserves. The rest of your post is interesting! A lot of it sounds like it might be a distinction, but maybe not that much of a difference? Sugar levels in grapes are vulnerable to heavy rain more than to heat, there are special yeasts to handle oversugared juice, and you can water down the juice if the fermentation gets botched... so yeah, wine's going to become more of a hassle to make and to suffer in quality as climate change wreaks havoc on the world, just maybe not in the ways that I said?

""more sugar makes for inferior wines"" is an extremely simplistic argument to begin with, and while hot summers usually make for more % in the harvest, it's way more about the amount of rain than it is about the heat. Half a week of rain in september can lower the sugar concentration a crazy amount, and far outweight the temperature thing. Plus, there's a ton of tinkering with different types of... yeast? are they called yeast in english? the magical wine fairies. Most die off halfway through the fermentation process at ""high"" sugar concentration because they make environments where they can't survive due to the alcohol content, but theres specialised types of yeast that live in unusual environments to correct or salvage that shit. Also, you can water the wines, or more commonly mix them with lower sugar concentration juice to lower the alcohol concentration. Which, ""worst wines"" argument and all, is a completely valid way to salvage a botched fermentation, and a few liters go a long way. Were it not because of this, my region would rountinely make red wines in the 17-18º range, which is the kind of wine that we made on the 80s and early 90s, way before climate change got to this point, just because we didn't know better and we had like three proper enologists in the whole region.

I usually don&#39;t post contrary material because I see no point in inevitably engaging with trolls, but I just said something about global warming and triggered a bunch of people who were triggered I was triggered. Someone made fun of my liberal tears, someone else told me that &quot;saving the earth sounds nice but it means too much sacrifice and will result in the killing of all poor people&quot; (an argument I was not familiar with), and another person said climate science was too vague to worry about because &quot;we don&#39;t even know how bad co2 really is&quot;.I don&#39;t understand how so many scientifically illiterate people genuinely think they know better than the experts. Dear lord.<br /><br />EDIT: forgot to mention the brilliant retort I got of &quot;well, climate change is an inevitability. Ice ages happen, warming occurs, the earth changes and it is arrogant to think humans can do anything about it.&quot; It is reminiscent of the idea &quot;if everyone dies eventually, then people should just run into the middle of busy intersections with their eyes closed.&quot; It is baffling to me that even those who admit to climate change seem to throw up their hands in the air and would rather go on living like they do and have to terraform mars instead of making some sacrifices and attempt to save the only place in the known universe we are currently aware of that can sustain life. The earth won&#39;t end in a colossal boom where we all ascend painlessly to heaven, it will just start sucking so much harder. And harder and harder.

As you said yourself, transporting meat and plant is the same. The distance counts of course but I don't understand how could you not take into account the neccessary resources for these different products.

When we're talking about food we're talking about transportation emissions, and whether you're transporting meat or wheat is largely irrelevant; what matters is the distance. Eating local produce is the best way to reduce your impact, so if eating local bacon stops you importing pineapple it's probably better that you do that. Of course that says nothing of what you want, and if you don't want to eat meat that's your decision; fundamentally though there is no further validation (nor is it necessary for there to be) for veganism other than personal choice.

We don't need a million toasters a year that break in 2 years, and when we have that breakable toaster (+LITERAL MILLIONS OF TONS OF OTHER PRODUCTS LIKE IT) we waste resources. Lots of resources. That helps create climate change, and is the result of capitalism. Secondly: The amount of stuff people want, and the types of stuff they want is at least partially artificial. Yes, people will still want stuff. But also Yes, they will want *less* stuff. At least if you market at them less, and don't make the signifiers of doing well be having a large number of things. Make it so that doing well is, I don't know, (picking randomly) the ability to have a skill like reading/writing music, and people will have a different standard of living to live up to. The phenomena of keeping up with the Jones won't go away in the sense that people will stop looking to each other. But you can change WHAT is desirable about the Jones to aspire to. Do you see? People are sold things they don't need because it benefits the system to market non-helpful things as a primary aspect of capitalist consumer economies. Again, people will still want stuff, just, if they aren't constantly marketed to and convinced (sometimes quite coercively) they'll want less of it. Thirdly: If we actually had a kind of means of sharing goods, instead of focusing on ideals that capitalism uses to make us better consumers (like hyper individualistic need to have what would otherwise be redundant items) we could break the mold and have something like, say, A Goods Library. A place where you go to borrow that hammer you only need once a year if that, and then return it. Then you can have access to a hammer, but not have to own a hammer. Don't even have to pay for it, unless you walk off with it. Just like a books library.",UCASk866Fdgm4-IbNmQX32dA,1,Ugw96_FRe5eMjMRn2FB4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

We have to think about what we need and what we don't. We should be considering making things because they're useful/enjoyable/necessary, not because they might elevate us beyond our peers. Speaking of elevation above. I think we should probably stop that from being as much of a thing. Begin moving toward a system which doesn't allow for, or strongly reduces wealth hoarding, as well as reducing existing hoards (tax the fucking rich) and once we reduce wealth we need a global Jubilee. Erase All Debt. Further, I think we should move toward a system that doesn't require work for people to live. (A universal basic income would solve this without an economic system change, but you could do it via changing the whole system too) and stop centering work and jobs as the primary aspect of a person. They, or the lack of them, shouldn't define us. And also CPG Grey is probably right, robots are coming for our jobs anyway. Our interests, and achievements should be something we choose. There are needs the might still have to be fulfilled by people, and hopefully there will be people who want to do those things purely to be doing an important needed thing.

But here they are again saying we’re the ones denying science by pulling out the chromosomal sex definition which is probably the only fucking thing they paid attention to in biology class while they slept through the rest. Like, fuck, scientists and even trans people make a distinction between trans and cis people which should make it so fucking easy for them to understand and digest, yet they pretend that we’re saying trans people are cis and “celebrating a mental illness” when no one has ever said that trans people are cis nor has anyone ever said “gender dysphoria rules! I wish everyone would have gender dysphoria!” Transitioning literally is the treatment for gender dysphoria and celebrating people’s decision to take the right steps towards becoming happier in life and dealing with their gender dysphoria is totally reasonable.

Most alternatives we have access to are dependent or in some way derivative of fossil fuel energy. We are 15 years too late to avoid drastic economic impact once effects are felt. Any reduction now or in the future simply decreases the severity of the events, even complete cessation of emissions.<br /><br />The inconvenient truth is that a cool several fucking billion of us were only even born because of fossil fuels. Any technologies we develop will require substantial emissions to facilitate a transition to a more sustainable model at the current scale. Almost no aspect of the modern world is possible without large amounts of energy for production, operation, or both.<br /><br />The suggestions you gave would certainly reduce your emissions, but at this point the goal should absolutely not be to reduce. It should be to CEASE IMMEDIATELY. Not to mention many of those suggestions still require substantial dependence on fossil fuels. And without a literally god like miracle the only realistic way to do that is to become unilaterally more poor and give up a set of luxuries we were only granted from fossil fuels.<br /><br />People say time is money but that&#39;s bullshit.

Make fun of a lifestyle you consider to be ""pre stone age"" all you want(the alternative to which has only existed for a couple of lifetimes), doesn't change that there's no source of energy that isn't oil dependent in some way, and we only have oil until 2040 with the current amount of action being taken. We didn't earn oil, we found it. Most luxuries we have developed can be pretty easily traced to an abundance of energy from fossil fuels. Think about the massive expenditure of fossil fuels and also the emissions required to facilitate a transition to renewables with current technology available at the scale demanded by everyone, especially taking into consideration China and India with billions of people each. Something has definitely been deteriorating business as usual and it's obvious when you look at high level politicians the last few years across the world. With current level of energy and food I consume I have no problem saying my peace until there's no internet anymore. Not to mention, like I said, you and I are likely among the billions who owe their actual birth and continued life to fossil fuel energy in multiple ways.

It seems likely to me that the claim of bribery to bomb people was pulled from thin air, but it's not misinformed really, just jumping to conclusions. My intention is not to keep people from having to back up their claims. Bribing for war would definitely fall under the umbrella of profiteering to me. I can't read minds, but it seems to me like conversations like this are more about narratives than specifics. You don't change the minds of conspiracists by debunking them usually, but by teaching temperament and critical thinking. On the nazi thing, I admit I didn't follow the letter of what you said, but try to understand why. Bias got in the way a bit, but you did invite comparison to neo-nazis and what I'm trying to say is that you shouldn't compare them to anyone. This in no way detracts from any critique of alleged progressives or leftists. It's pure pathos, sure, but nazis just aren't sympathetic to me and it seems utterly absurd to compare well-intentioned people, and it gives nazis far too much credit. If nothing else I think I've demonstrated, with some embarrassment, that such comparisons interfere with reasonable conversation. The exception to this is if they're crypto obviously. It's ok to call people what they are. :p We obviously have different moral instincts and we've both expressed a certain amount of moral offense, which is ok. I've made no specific advocacy but I have expressed sympathy for certain kinds of political violence. I've chosen my words carefully here. Sympathy, not advocacy. I don't like the death penalty but I don't hold it against people if they want someone who hurt their family dead. Ethics ceases to matter. Capitalists may be more distant adversaries, but I feel the same bitterness, the gnawing knowledge that while I struggle to survive there are people who own the means of survival and use them for personal gain. It's hard for me to hold that against people. Anyway I'm tapping out 'cause this is a bit too stressful to me. Sorry if I came off as too combative.

Eight years in the making Obamacare had limited scope and did nothing to actually change the health care industry in the US, but just subsidised insurance for some people.

7092,Ugw-1OaI_lJGUpn5wYR4AaABAg,0.0,0,2018-12-02 01:11:50,Kristian Nygård,"Hey! Longtime viewer, first time commenter. <br /><br />Your video made me tremble in fear -- like litarally, physically shake -- during the most dire parts. I get these shakes when I read or hear particularly devastating stuff about climate change, which is my absolute gravest concern. It worries me to the point where it&#39;s my main source of depression and anxiety.<br /><br />The severity of the subject has compelled me to try and understand the world as best as possible. If we understand it, then maybe, hopefully, we can change it. I&#39;ve read almost sixty books so far this year, among them &quot;This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. The Climate&quot; by Naomi Klein and &quot;The Merchants of Doubt: How a Handful of Scientists Obscured the Truth on Issues from Tobacco Smoke to Global Warming&quot; by Naomi Oreskes and Erik M. Conway (I recommend these books). I&#39;ve also read books on philosophy, politics, neoliberalism, propaganda and fascism. I read heavy stuff, and it&#39;s downright masochistic at times. I think you have to be a masochist to keep my reading habits up for long.<br /><br />My greatest ambition in life is to become a writer and tackle the topics of climate change and fascism -- because I think the latter will flourish under the former. (My greatest areas of interest are climate change and fascism. Yup, I&#39;m great at parties.) But ambition often feels like a burden, and so I start doubting my talents, becoming afraid that I won&#39;t do my grand visions justice. As someone who&#39;s been a struggling writer yourself, you can relate, right? <br /><br />Your video was exactly what I needed. I&#39;ll doubtless rewatch it many times, like I&#39;ve done with all your videos (yes, even the ones you don&#39;t want me to see anymore. Sorry, baby, I can&#39;t help it! They&#39;re too good!) Along with depressing books, your channel has aided me greatly in my valiant effort to understand the world, and I&#39;m really only writing this long-ass comment to thank you. <br /><br />Thank you for your thought-provoking and hilarious videos. You tell bitter truths about the direst of topics, with wit. That&#39;s a gift, a gift I envy and aspire to attain myself. You&#39;re an inspiration and a motivational force. Thank you.<br /><br />PS: I loved the use of the reptile iconography at the end. &quot;The reptiles&quot; need not be like anything out of a conspiracy theory. A reptile may more broadly be understood as anyone who succumbs to an ideology where they just ignore climate change. They may know climate change is real, they may know their habits only worsens it, they may know who&#39;s ultimately responsible, but they just ignore the problem altogether because &quot;Feels good, man.&quot; They succumb to the sweet, numbing and nihilistic ideology of hedonistic consumption (which I guess you could also call fucking neoliberalism!) &quot;The reptiles&quot; are merely people who&#39;ve reverted to their reptile brain in this most deplorable fashion.",UCGiDJptYNuq9B_PD4RCBwOA,0,Ugw-1OaI_lJGUpn5wYR4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

Everything is connected, and there is no ""isolate cause"" which could bring the so called apocalypse. The consequences of climate change and resource exploitation lead to war and mass immigration, as it is happening right now. The situation is already going out of hand, maybe not in the US but here in Europe it definitely is. Mass immigration helps politicians like the infamous italian fascist Matteo Salvini to rise, since people ""need a villain"" like Contra said, and Salvini gave them one: the bad black man which came here to steal jobs, bring diseases and rape women. And an anti-europe, nationalist person like him promotes violent behavior towards other countries, which can very well lead to a future war not only among the middle eastern countries, but in a few years, an internal strife in Europe won't seem so unlikely to happen. So there we go. The so called apocalypse isn't just the sea rising up to swallow Earth, but people actively killing each other after carefully causing the reasons why we should actively kill each other. And probably, the sea will also rise up to swallow us all, together with a nuclear bombing and who knows what else. And unfortunately, there seems to be few people who understand the issue and wish to do something to change this destructive direction humanity has taken. The average person here, and I mean in Italy, wouldn't even understand shit or laugh at you if you started speaking about climate change.

I think the species has actually managed flinging a little bit of spooge into the future in worse situations than this once or twice before. What it's going to do is cause massive, rapid changes in the geographic distribution of the global population--and my country (the US) among others doesn't seem to be showing much of any capacity to handle the politics of that kind of thing in a rational way. That's probably the biggest real worry here--the currently dominant political systems of the world seem like the things that are more plausibly unlikely to survive this. And no, that's not an optimistic prediction. Sudden, drastic political changes that happen under intense crisis conditions rarely lead to desirable outcomes. The thing that WOULD definitely kill every last human and end the species would be the outbreak of any war between any two (or, God help us, more than two) of the world's 3 current most economically and politically powerful countries. Russian-American War = Human Extinction Chinese-American War = Human Extinction Russian-Chinese War = Human Extinction Does that become more likely in a scenario of the world's biggest economies and political systems being severely disrupted by a massive population redistribution that they are constitutionally incapable of responding to in a maximally rational manner? Well... yeah. Of course it does. But it won't be the climate itself that kills us.

This was organised by the school kids themselves. <br /><br />Proud to say my daughter was one of the strikers. So there are some that care. <br /><br />Also, Australian politicians are just as bad- they’re celebrating the opening of another new coal mine (even calling it- a massive Indian mining corporation, a “little Aussie battler” 🙄). That coal mine is being given all the free water they want (in an arid country!), are being given a “royalties holiday- so they are basically being paid to take our resources, instead of paying us for them, and are right next to, and shipping the coal out directly through the Great Barrier Reef- you know, just the largest reef in the world, the one that dying in front of our eyes- not to mention, the reef that supports 70,000 tourism jobs. But sure, risking all of that for maybe 40 temporary local jobs is totally worth it. <br /><br />Our government is also pushing for more coal fired power stations- even though they are already more expensive than renewable alternatives. Gee, wonder if that has anything to do with the massive donations, and revolving door of pollies- mining company lobbyists? Our current minister for the environment literally used to work for a mining company. A former resources minister now works for the offical mining lobby. <br /><br />It’s all so corrupt and fucked up. They don’t care that they’re killing humanity’s future.

This is why in discussions of food deserts and the importance of preserving corner stores in the wake of gentrification cheap McDonald hamburgers and the like are brought up. Because even if the ingredients to roasted eggplant or salad are more affordable over say a months worth of budget than something akin to McDonald’s everynight, McDonald’s, meat of all qualities, and animal products (milk cheese egg) are MUCH cheaper calorically. This is often overlooked because of discussions of calorie control and dieting, but a lot of lower class work still requires calorie intake, and often may require a higher calorie intake than higher paid working positions (ignoring lifestyles outside of the workspace, I’m talking bare minimum here) due to the requirement to work longer hours, do heavy lifting, staying on your feet, etc. And while something like McDonald’s r whatever doesn’t have high nutritional value, our bodies are MUCH more reliant on calories than proper vitamins to function properly/at all, and is one of the reasons Veganisn is NOT widely recommended as a suitable or even viable lifestyle change to help content global warming (as opposed to vegetarianism which IS widely recommended) since non meat animal products like dairy and eggs contain more calories than many conventional vegan options (this is actually WHY we have dairy at all, because Northern Europeans needed to cultivate a source of high high caloric food during the cold winters, and had to develop/evolve lactose tolerance past adolescence. This is also why caucasians have the lowest rates of lactose intolerance, since the gene isn’t inherit to humans as a whole and originated in Northern Europe, with the descendants in modern day carrying on the same genetic coding no matter their actual home tempature or calorie needs)<br /><br />Really loved the video, as a nuclear physics undergrad the future of energy consumption and distribution is intergrak to my studies and I just thought I’d share some context for others to an offhand comment that tends to pop up in other political and apolitical discussions not directly related to climate change.",UCoY_cMC7W1Gg-k4c4FFgxtg,0,Ugy_uh8BDkwNVt-Cgix4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

Hey, at least China&#39;s going to save us....<br /><br />Ok, maybe I should go ahead and expand upon this point a bit more. Hopefully, everyone is aware of the 35 BILLION (yes with a B) US DOLLARS China is putting into green infrastructure. Not just in China, but developing nations?<br /><br />Why is China doing this? To become the next world super power. In a few short years, thanks to green infrastructure in underdeveloped countries that were dominated by the US and Saudi&#39;s to keep underdeveloped for easier raping, these countries will no longer be beholden to either religion (Saudi&#39;s construction of Muslim universities or the US demanding abstinence only education, just as two examples) or to the enslavement of its people (on going civil wars for easier access to materials or slave state jobs, just as examples). Once these countries are producing eco friendly products and have higher educational standards, China will have MASSIVE trade partners unlike anything before in history.<br /><br />So that&#39;s it, right? Not by a long shot. This is the reason I am not worried about North Korea. In short, China knows where it is about to be in relation to the rest of the world (as THE superpower). They are smart enough to realize that in order to be a world superpower, they need a world to be a superpower of. China is already enacting stringent environmental regulations. I have a theory though. With China dumping this money in green infrastructure and technology, they are actively researching ways of not just fighting global warming, but actively reversing it. They have already made great strides elsewhere with science (genetically modified twins? Fuck yea, I&#39;m in). So, I would say it&#39;s not too far fetched to believe they have some kind of plan.<br /><br />So let&#39;s say I am right. China is about to end global warming within however long, no more worries, right? WHAT THE HELL? HOW IN THE NAME OF OUR EVERLOVING FAVORITE KERMIT IMPRESSIONIST DID YOU EVER COME TO THAT CONCLUSION? Even if this does happen, it means very little if we do not slow global warming to a point were it is reversible. Let&#39;s say it doesn&#39;t matter and China can reverse it anyway, well, I don&#39;t know about you but I still don&#39;t like China. I don&#39;t really like any power actually. Any superpower is inherently evil. The US will just drag behind unless we enact our own green new deal. Not that I&#39;m in favor of the US just creating a new status quo with a green new deal, but holy shit, we still need to be careful. Even if I&#39;m right, that doesn&#39;t mean we won&#39;t be open to new threats and challenges. Sustainability for humanity IS a huge problem that green resources will help fix (feeding a few more billion people? Easier done when the crop takes less then something like a hundredth of current crops... yes I&#39;m talking about crickets, get over it). We still have a lot to work for and to fight for. I would also never admit this or say it to a skeptic, but....<br /><br />We can point out that China is about to become an economic powerhouse because of their green new deal. Maybe we can use the right&#39;s open xenophobia to coerce them to help with a green new deal of our own because I&#39;m pretty sure the right really doesn&#39;t like China.<br /><br />Either that or I&#39;m just crazy.

I also tend to be wary of advice from those who aren't vegan yet as, while it seems like you genuinely understand and want to reduce suffering, many people give advice to make vegan activism not have an effect on them, trying to avoid being told outright what they support.

I would like to stress that it is commonly seen as a scale, rather than a definite divide, as many of the animals commonly farmed such as cows and pigs have more in common with us than many would think. Things like friendships, maternal bonds and grieving are very human-seeming traits that a lot of other species share. This ability to experience wellbeing and suffering does seem harder to discern for things like insects, but if we can then why not give them the benefit of the doubt. With regard to the inconvenience, as I said in my last reply, does the convenience of eating the animal mean more to you than their life means to them? You might have to think about buying hummus instead, but the animal is losing everything. That being said, I do understand it's a bit of a big lifestyle change, I still struggle to plan proper meals sometimes and I gave up dairy and eggs over a year ago. I would say that the biggest hurdle is committing to it for the first week or so, and once you've got a few meals you can cook, and figured out where to buy any new ingredients, it's just a slight change to your previous routine. It doesn't have to be instant either, you can start right away by swapping your milk and butter for dairy-free alternatives without any effort, and you could cook only vegan meals for one day a week to start, increasing as you get used to it.",UCSxINN6khCoS09Jkzqq5AMA,1,Ugz-5yaSYqIjFHiB0qJ4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

It stems from the difference in sentience, and hence the range of experience and amount of wellbeing the animal can experience (hypothetically, there could be species more sentient than us, whose joy and suffering are more intense and whose life it would be a greater injustice to end). While most people who eat animals would claim to value life in such a way, through their actions they add an important stage. Fly < Pig <<< Taste of pig < Convenience of eating pig < Human, where the taste derived and the convenience of following the social norm are valued higher than the life and the freedom from suffering of the pig. While this may make sense from the human perspective, we know that pigs are also sentient, and can feel pain and fear, and can suffer. I find it hard to believe that a bacon sandwich means more to anyone (who isn' t on a desert island) than the pig's life means to the pig. As for the fly, why not catch it and put it outside?

There's no middle ground between assured destruction and continuing the way we are, the way they are (71% responsible). The amount of people who buy into this crap demonstrates the failure of our elected officials and electorate to prioritize education over money in their own lives, and that reflects in how they behave in office, allowing themselves to be swayed and having zero principles in the face of donations by self-interested, greedy corporations, over being humble in the face of scientific facts.

You can hear silly rationalisations like ""I travel a lot but I try to compensate by eating less red meat"". (frequent long distance airplane traveling cannot be compensated by your veggie lunch).

I may indirectly cue them to become defensive just by me stating that I&#39;m a vegetarian (I humbly submit, an imperfect one--after 29 years of eating meat every day it&#39;s quite hard to quit all at once), even though I explicitly state that I have no issue with them eating meat, that they can eat meat in front of me, and that I don&#39;t judge them for it (only one can judge oneself). Psychology is so interesting (and a fucking demonic bitch).<br /><br />As you mentioned, it seems that humans (on the average) care more about our own time alive than the time our collective progeny will be alive. We want want me want now. How much of this is a Sisyphean task that will require an impossible(?) paradigm shift in human desires to really come to pass? It seems that we&#39;re fighting something that cannot be won. Human nature is so depressing I cannot stand it. I secretly (not anymore) wish that a piece of space debris or meteor will crash into me one day and just end my consciousness suddenly and instantly (me being the only person to die). More power to those who can continue fighting for just causes. My motivation is just getting weaker and weaker as time passes.

Loss of wild areas to agriculture is the leading cause of the current mass extinction of wildlife.&quot; <br /> <br /> Contribution of farmed animal products: <br />Calories 18% <br />Protein 37% <br />Land use 83% <br />Greenhouse gas emissions 58% <br />Water pollution 57% <br />Air pollution 56% <br />Freshwater withdrawals 33% <br /> <br />&quot;The study, published in the journal Science, created a huge dataset based on almost 40,000 farms in 119 countries and covering 40 food products that represent 90% of all that is eaten. It assessed the full impact of these foods, from farm to fork, on land use, climate change emissions, freshwater use and water pollution (eutrophication) and air pollution (acidification).&quot; <br /> <br />&quot;The analysis also revealed a huge variability between different ways of producing the same food. For example, beef cattle raised on deforested land result in 12 times more greenhouse gases and use 50 times more land than those grazing rich natural pasture. But the comparison of beef with plant protein such as peas is stark, with even the lowest impact beef responsible for six times more greenhouse gases and 36 times more land.&quot; <br /> <br /><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/31/avoiding-meat-and-dairy-is-single-biggest-way-to-reduce-your-impact-on-earth"">https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/31/avoiding-meat-and-dairy-is-single-biggest-way-to-reduce-your-impact-on-earth </a><br /> <br /><a href=""http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6392/987"">http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6392/987 </a><br /> <br /> <br />&quot;Though much of the world is focused on transitioning away from fossil fuels as a way to fight climate change, there is another, often-overlooked climate change culprit: animal agriculture and its environmental impact.

Cars are obviously bad, but a lot of people don't really have an option. It would severely limit the lives of a huge portion of working class people, in particular, that can't afford electric cars. Heating/cooling is another big one, but that's something that usually comes with a home and costs many thousands of dollars to change, so it's hard to demand individual action there too. There are a lot of small things, like LED light bulbs, that don't have significant impact on people's lives, but also have a very limited impact on carbon footprints.  But cutting down on meat (beef especially), however, has huge environmental effects with just a small change in one's life and only during the transition period. Of course, if you can get away from cars too then that's good, but I can't blame anyone for being stuck with one and the biggest impacts are not things that can be changed by individual consumer action. It won't stop power plants from burning coal and it won't stop industries from using oil powered trucks for transport. The only way consumer action could stop that is if most of us stopped using electricity, heating and only purchase very local goods. Those require political action, but if you're an individual and want to reduce your environmental impact then cutting down on meat is the best thing to do (unless you're well off enough to get rid of the car, change your heating systems and cut down on flying). It also has a great effect on personal and public health. The average westerner eat way too much meat. Red meat and especially processed red meats are not very healthy at all (both being strongly linked to cancer, for instance) and the use of anti-biotics in the meat industry has greatly sped up the proliferation of anti-biotic resistant bacteria. Really, the only downside is that you have to learn some new recipes and that meat can taste pretty good.",UCA0Md2RpbY5lEhEZOddMQQg,1,Ugy__Cxa6Qq89AbKdbF4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

At the moment the best we can do is bury it under mountains and hope for the best. You think that's not going to come back to haunt us at some point in the future. We have no way of reliably communicating the danger to people thousands of years in the future and no way of ensuring these vast storage dumps will remain sealed for such a huge amount of time. Nuclear is so far from the right answer to the problem. The sun beams enough energy onto the surface of the earth to meet our annual needs thousands of times over.

I mostly believe it to be social programs against businesses that cause these issues. Bailouts, special taxes, regulations, and unions will not allow the companies to die, nor make the profits to expand, and forces them to keep and maintain a staff of incompetent workers, and, in many cases, ban and restrict new and efficient technologies (as a skilled laborer, I&#39;ve seen this myself), while companies no longer have to worry about ethical profits, so long as they side with the right politicians, like Inhofe or Hillary (yes, they&#39;re all in it).

For example, a recent narrative arc criticised ""people who take the piss out of the church because of the sex offence scandals that have occurred"", and the church almost unanimously rallied against those episodes. If they made those opinions based on clips viewed out of context, I can 100% see why so many people came to those conclusions. However, if they had actually watched the entire thing, and done so in a critical manner, they may have found that while they may disagree on many points, its not the bogeyman that they made it out to be. But in practice, there seems to be very little overlap between the church, and people who watch South Park. So they could probably make whatever negative claims they like about the show, and their trusting audience will rally around them without question.

Nothing would be different with a Hillary Clinton in the White House; she&#39;s actually to the right of Trump on many key issues. Instead of being outraged by the same damn actions Trump is taking, the establishment would be making endless excuses for her, telling us how oh so pragmatic her preservation of the status quo is.<br /><br />I&#39;m a good deal older than most here, and have been hearing for decades that we need to hold our nose and vote Democratic, that they&#39;ll somehow magically turn left one day, becoming the party of FDR again. Being able to take the left&#39;s vote for granted has instead given them license to push further to the right every year, so that they&#39;re now more conservative than the Republicans were under Reagan, while the Republicans today are full blown fascist. <br /><br />Trusting that the slightly less evil half of the corrupt duopoly is going to save is catastrophically naive. We needed to start investing in a viable option outside of the this back-stabbing, hopelessly corrupt, unsalvageable institution decades ago.

Fantasizing that the Democrats, at long last, this time for reals, are going to so what&#39;s needed if only we get them back in the majority and in the Oval Office, is criminally irresponsible.<br /><br />It would be a repeat of 2009-2016...swept into office with a crushing majority on a progressive platform, with a mandate to enact radical reform, the Democrats shafted us again and adopted and expanded most of Bush&#39;s worse policies, pretending that the mean old Republicans made them do it. The filibuster isn&#39;t a magic bullet that instantly kills any bill; it, at most, delays legislation from being voted on for a bit.

Basically, our forests and chaparral lands have far greater density of vegetation than ever before (since the end of the last age) increasing the fuel load of both surface and ""ladder"" fuels (which are important because they can cause ground fires to become crown fires, which are nearly unstoppable). The droughts and increased temperatures California is experiencing due to climate change has, well, dried out these fuels and increased the likely they will catch fire. There are other factors, such as the explosive increase in people living in the Wildland Urban Interface, various epidemics of tree-killing diseases and insects, etc, that are also increasing fire hazard. Also, it is critical to note that many California ecosystems SHOULD be experiencing fire, from either from lightning ignitions or prescribed burning, as many species and landscapes require fire to continue existing. Fire is not inherently bad, it is necessary and good for certain environments, its just that under the current conditions the fires that break out are more extreme and destructive than they were historically.",UCv_T6nybylzBwmcCVZFNGPg,1,Ugxt6MiJNqbWpXCSNl94AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

Practically speaking it won't make much difference though, and you'd be better off devoting the time you'd otherwise spend on childcare to political action against companies and politicians and direct action against drilling sites for oil and natural gas, logging, and coal mines, as well as slaughterhouses and other directly-accessible elements of the meat industry. If you can't do that political action and are going to have a child one way or another, adopt.

I&#39;m one of the people over at EarthStrike, I was hoping to add a little bit to this video.<br /><br />So first of all there is one bit of crucial misinformation in this video concerning the emissions of companies. In reality it&#39;s 71% of global INDUSTRIAL emissions that stem from 100 producers, not companies but also for example government it self. Now those direct emissions are a smaller fragment of the global total one has to consider the part companies like Exxon play in this by not only adding directly into the pool of emissions but also fueling factors like transportation, other industry and energy production. Which is why it is important to both understand that we need to change our own behavior but also act politically in order to quickly change not just the landscape on and individual level but also on an industrial level. Attacking the problem on both sides. Contra already makes some good points on what you can do <b>individually</b> to help change the world, I&#39;m here to tell you a bit about 3 things you can do politically.<br /><br />3 Things that are not even that hard.<br />First, take a look at platforms like ours over at <a href=""http://earth-strike.com/"">earth-strike.com</a>, our friends over at Extinction Rebellion or any other local organizations. Spread awareness by tweeting and sharing, make a meme if that&#39;s what you feel like, i mean political memes are lame as hell but if this is gonna go down we might as well laugh a bit right? Talk to your friends, your union or fellow students and workers. Word of mouth is always appreciated!<br />Second, go to a protest. The folks over at Extinctions Rebellion specialize at that and we can highly recommend them. I get it, ugh going out, ugh peope. But just being there helps build up a presence, it shows politicians that we will not sit idly and let our planet die.<br />And finally, Strike! This is where we at <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23EarthStrike"">#EarthStrike</a> come in, we&#39;re organizing a global general strike on the 27th of September to push for stricter government action to *not have our planet die*. You&#39;d think it&#39;d be less controversial but here we are. Yes this is the hardest part but come on, isn&#39;t it a bit exciting too?~<br /><br />Anyway, thanks for the nod and wink, I really hope this video gets us somewhere. :)",UCiRgrqifwyCEJT6coTZh4FQ,0,UgxoAGyE8oVAVOOUwDN4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

As far as I understand it, if we just put all energy into research about carbon extraction from the atmosphere, and devote all our time to developing solar power, we will be fine.  The problem here is the money still involved in the oil industry and also the fact that planes are so important for almost every type of larger business, and almost no planes are carbon-free. The only thing we really can do here, is lobby for government restrictions on these aspects of industry and simultaneously lobby for government support of climate friendly technology. The other alternative is actual revolution, but I'm neither brave nor strong enough for that.",UCb0Txg37kNtykncadSmMdVw,1,UgwlJT-eg7vhGE8wH894AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

The IPCC special report 15 (Global warming of 1.5 degrees), in scenarios P1, P2, P3 and P4 all state a critical role for nuclear in which generation from nuclear at minimum, doubles (+98%) and in the most likely scenario, P3, _quintuples_ (+501%) by 2050. https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2018/07/SR15_SPM_High_Res.pdf (Page 16). P3 is the pathway which most policy makers are being informed as being the most likely because it allows for primary energy growth (thus allowing developing countries to grow and industrialise instead of staying in agrarian poverty). It is also the pathway in which negative emissions are absolutely necessary. Whether they come from nuclear synthetic fuels or bioenergy carbon capture and storage is still up in the air at this point. P1 is highly unlikely, stating a 30% reduction in primary energy with effective decarbonisation happening _right now._ The only time _any_ dip in primary energy occurred was in 2008, when the global financial crisis spilled over into the real economy. Wages collapsed, countries collapsed, governments collapsed. Around a 5% dip in primary energy occurred after the GFC. And now, just like in 1920, around 10 years after the collapse, we are seeing a resurgence in right wing authoritarianism. Climate pledges are being shed, Paris promises are in the process of being broken, and the world's largest emitter, the United States, has a climate denier for a president. So you need to take a long hard look at what the climate scientists are saying. Even in the scenario in which primary energy decreases by 30% (implying a global recession *six times* worse than 2008) and assuming _no hard right resurgence derailing climate policy_ nuclear power _doubles._ In the most likely scenario, nuclear power _quintuples._ Are you ready to take on the work of thousands of scientists working around the world?

In point of fact emissions from combustion, and even emissions from the mining required for wind turbines and solar panels, expose workers to _more_ radiation, per unit energy, than the 3 meltdowns that have occured in nuclear accidents to date. UNSCEAR has determined that over its life cycle, nuclear power has exposed people to less radiation than even solar panel mining and manufacture or geothermal daily operations. http://www.unscear.org/docs/publications/2016/UNSCEAR_2016_Annex-B-CORR.pdf (from page 211 onwards) So even with nuclear power going wrong it exposes less people to radiation than fossil fuels and renewables going right. We can and do store spent fuel safely. Just ask the Swiss, the Dutch, the Germans, the French, the Americans, the British, the Canadians, the Japanese. Not a _single_ person has been irradiated from spent fuel operations across 50 years, 3 continents, and more than 400 reactor sites. If you believe that nuclear waste is a dangerous problem then I can only say that you have been misinformed. It is only waste if we choose to waste it, like President Carter did when he banned reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel and the rest of the world, abiding by the NPT agreement, followed. Oklo in Gabon, a natural nuclear reactor, proved that dangerous fission products and transuranics produced from the fission reaction, move less than 5 meters in 2 billion years, in water saturated, porous rock. If nature can isolate the products of fission for 2 billion years in _leaky geological formations_ we can store it indefinitely in formations known to be geologically and tectonically stable. https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/181620-2-billion-year-old-african-nuclear-reactor-proves-that-mother-nature-still-has-a-few-tricks-up-her-sleeve/2 Now, this is not to say that people have _not_ been irradiated when handling nuclear material. Plenty of people have been irradiated and become sick or even died from mis-handling of _medical_ radiation sources like Cobalt 60 gamma sterilisers. People have been irradiated at nuclear weapons production facilities (because the fissile concentrations are higher, as are spontaneous neutrons and gammas from weapons grade material). There were even US scientists that inhaled and ingested plutonium (UPPU cohort, https://blog.education.nationalgeographic.org/2015/10/19/the-scientists-who-pee-plutonium/) as part of weapons programs. For a while they were setting radiation detectors off with their urine. Thankfully the lax standards of the medical and military nuclear industry have not translated to the civilian nuclear power industry. Even so it has resulted in 3 meltdowns. In total, around 50 people across more than 60 years of nuclear power generation have died from radiation or related causes, with up to 4000 potential additional thyroid cancer cases over 50 years from Chernobyl. If you divide that out, nuclear power is in fact the safest form of energy. It has killed the least. It has polluted the least. It has saved 1.8 million lives, according to the climate scientist, Dr James Hansen. https://ourworldindata.org/what-is-the-safest-form-of-energy If you still dislike nuclear power despite that, then I am afraid to say that you are as much of a science denier as the climate deniers are. https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/the-curious-wavefunction/nuclear-power-may-have-saved-1-8-million-lives-otherwise-lost-to-fossil-fuels-may-save-up-to-7-million-more/",UCUjmCjYul-xC-TplX2mkwJQ,1,UgzB_sk_GuXbk4LvZBl4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

I do appreciate the mind which thinks all things can be simplified and that of course is needed in any discussion, but realize that those are not at all my positions, but are summaries (some) of the CONCLUSIONS of my position (and summaries are the least important part of anyone's argument). The reason why I come to these conclusions is based on what I have been discussing: Kant's critique showing that categorization is based on human minds, the creation of the moral sphere by groups of human minds throughout history with correcting mechanisms which have passed onto us an evolved morality which leftists are ruining, and the ignorance of most people's idea of evolutionary history in seeing religion and morality as part of that history. So, epistemology, ethics, value theory, and evolution ground those conclusions. At that point, we would then need to argue for the epistemological positions, evolution, etc. So, no, your summation is not accurate in the end because each word in what you wrote takes on different meanings based upon the system from which it comes.

The issue with modern leftism (I would never call them liberals, that is a honorable term) is that they merely took what was great about modern secularized Christianity and removed it from its historical substructure. So now you get something grotesque - nihilistic existence with moral values. So, your life is not for anything, it has no meaning, no purpose, but they expect people to then start being moral to everyone.

Let's put it this way... If I have one fork in front of you and then I ask you how many forks are there, you say ""one""...If I were to then ask you to then point out ""oneness"" you would have no object to point to because the concept of ""oneness"" is a concept of the human mind which is then projected upon the world.

Now, even if you want to be a Platonist in mathematics and keep a Platonic realm here, I don't think you can do it in ethics or value theory. I don't see this as detrimental, I actually see it as good. It means we are responsible for the world (so a type of ethics comes in through existential value). Now, to your bid valuing... it is too anthropomorphized to be useful. You are projecting your value onto the bird and seeing as a human.

You often seem to put so many music, film, art, and even literary references and/or easter eggs into your vids from past sub-cultural scenes that I love, but sometimes I think I’m just reading too far into the imagery. I swear it’s a reference to that album, though. You can tell me I’m an idiot if I’m wrong... (also, I thought there was a Devine reference here too, but that one definitely won’t surprise me)<br /><br />Anyway, I FUCKING LOVE THIS!

I mean, the idea that conservatives aren&#39;t in favor of massive government is delusional. They constantly pass regulation trying to micromanage people&#39;s lives.

Then conservatives come and want to regulate the shit out of it.

Think it through: what would you do if you were in their place and the lives of you and your children depended on getting somewhere that hasn't been devastated by climate change. Never mind the fact that the rich countries to the north are chiefly responsible for the crisis; you don't have time for irony, you're on the run with your family, remember? People will come north fleeing drought and starvation and the political and economic chaos that come with drought and starvation. We'll need more troops on the border to shoot at climate refugees. That will cost money. Eventually the refugees will come armed and we'll need more troops. That will cost more money. After enough time has passed the refugee problem will start to look more like an insurgency...Gonna need some money. That's one reason the military isn't in the business of climate change denial and are making plans. Also as desertification starts to displace millions internal to the country, Canada would be wise to harden its own US border against encroachment by US climate refugees attempting to cross.

I&#39;m not really able to do the Vegan diet as my body does not seem to function on it. I&#39;m also the person who can eat bloody improperly cooked chicken and not get sick from it... somehow... I was really really thirsty for blood that day too--which I just assume is me being somewhat mentally unhinged. I try to not let my desires to consume blood interfere with normal human interaction--but this was a case where I managed to--not be sick for a few days like a bunch of people around me who ate the chicken seeing me eat it.<br /><br />THAT being said--if we were to have people eat two servings of meat a day--it would be a huge REDUCTION to how much meat is being consumed. If you take out a deck of cards--put away your Legends Magic Deck--like a normal set of French Suit Poker Cards--that is how big a single serving of meat is. What kind of crazy person only eats two servings of meat in a day? Most sane reasonable people eat a years worth of meat in a single day--like rational people. So--if people who do enjoy meat, were to eat a reasonable amount of meat (hell, for a lot of people limiting it to five servings a day would drastically drop it)... we&#39;d see some great improvements.<br /><br />I will go vegan, if people start letting me have a tea made from vampire tea bags (yeah... I know--other less crazy people could prolly do it easier)... but... in my &quot;being slightly unhinged&quot; I have to acknowledge that meat consumption is kind of over the edge and over the top. I mean... look at a deck of cards... think about when the last time you only ate two servings of meat in a single day was. Ask what that would look like ordering it at a fast food restaurant.<br /><br />Also... Grolar Bears are a thing now because of Climate Change. Most people do not sit around going, &quot;okay... Grizzly Bears--but how could we make them more fearsome?&quot;... but here we are...

When concerned mothers were trying to save the planet by unplugging their refrigerators and sending their husbands out in the family three-row SUV to buy ice every morning.

All of the misinformation out there; Some from people pursuing purely selfish agendas, some from people with the best of intentions but a lack of faith in the average person to be motivated without some &#39;finessing&#39; of the facts, and some from people who just straight-up didn&#39;t know what they were talking about...<br /><br />Because of all of this, ten years ago I knew... I... KNEW... that Climate Change was in fact.... not really a big deal.<br /><br />Some dry areas would become wet, some wet areas would become dry, growing seasons would become longer and ocean-front property would move three inches closer to the beach; no big deal right? But if you just couldn&#39;t bear cheaper strawberries year-round then stopping Climate Change would be as easy as KILLING SIX BILLION PEOPLE.<br /><br />What? You think that&#39;s too extreme?

The atmosphere will thicken until it blocks almost all useable light while holding in all the warmth until the surface temperature rises to be able to melt lead, like on Venus!

Ask yourselves why the fires in California are reaching insane temperatures.

Like how chain stores normally operate in areas with limited options: lower prices to steal business and drive local stores out of business, then raise them again once they are the only game in town. And that’s not even getting into vertical integration, monopolies and the new trusts, and all the other ways corporations have of ensuring profit and power even if they take a temporary loss. You need force to pressure corporations nowadays, boycotts are more symbolic than effective. Especially since it’s quite likely any given animal product using business is also owned by the business that owns the vegan options. ‘Environmentalist’ and ‘animal friendly’ are just commodities now. Animals are also products and it’s in the corporations’ best interests to sell them to you. The livestock industry will fight tooth and nail to keep from losing all the money eliminating animal products because it’s profitable to continue and ruinously expensive to stop. Killing the animals that can’t be profited from anymore or killing them because there’s no way to keep them alive is the most likely result depending on how the end of animal products comes about. That’s not an argument against doing so, just a statement. Humanity has warped animals to feed us in such a way that the end of many species will happen whether we die out or stop eating them. It’s yet another unstoppable tragedy humans have set in the future. In short: boycotts are a good way to show intent, but force is necessary to bring about true change because the necessary change will not happen under capitalism.

The 100 companies argument sort of shadows the necessity of veganism and reduces the significance of individual choice. After all a lot of those companies will have roots in animal agriculture so the increase of individuals going vegan will undoubtedly have an affect on them, just look at how the dairy industry are suffering. Animal agriculture, livestock and their by products accounts for around 51% of all greenhouse gas emissions according to research from 2009-2015. So individual choice could have a great impact, it’s more sustainable to change minds and perspectives through education rather than pushing for taxes on meat etc.<br /><br />2.) Its great that you pointed out that that plant based meals are cheaper, it dismantles the fact that veganism is this bougie thing, but it’s kinda disappointing that right off the bat of celebrating delicious meat based foods, in the vegan case you said ‘you can eat lentils and sprouts’. Hearing this won’t make veganism appealing to people, after all there’s so many cheap and really good vegan food people can have and enjoy, ie pasta, fries, burritos, hummus and falafel, burgers, plus a lot of Asian and Indian food is already vegan or can be veganised.<br /><br />3.) This is really pendantic but although you mentioned the dairy industry and eating less red meat, it probably would’ve been better to say them together and not as two separate things. Beef makes up the vast majority of red meat and causes the most environmentally impact of any animal, but I’ve known people who have stopped eating beef but then continue to consume dairy not making the connection. This is a problem, in my country of the UK 50% of our beef comes from spend dairy cows (the other 50% from calfs and male cows I think) and I imagine it’s similar in the US. So essentially what this means is that the beef industry and the dairy industry are one in the same, leading to the raising of the same animals and ergo the same environmental impact. So talking about them separately when they’re inextricably linked runs the risk of people limiting the consumption of one but not the other making no real difference, instead they are just receiving a different manifestation of the same environmental impact.<br /><br />Source: <a href=""http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts/"">http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts/</a><br /><br />Thanks for covering the topic though I’m not tryna be overly critical I think your work is amazing I just wanted to point out some problems💖",UClRaL5TaH7dzCalzCM6cAuA,0,Ugxh5yGF14cQEzMMKfp4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

In my case, I don't think that there is anything else I can do to help them with this or the myriad other issues separating us and I see that now it is time for me to take direct action. I have already been a vegetarian for about a year now (I don't think I could give up cheese, honestly) and I vote in every single election and I have even donated to some campaigns and causes over the years. I can't afford an electric car now but I have wanted to get one and will do so when I can. So then the last and newest step is to join a group and start actively volunteering my time and effort to trying to make a change. I am in Florida if anyone has any suggestions. Thank you all so much for this outpouring of helpful ideas! You've made my night week. ; 3",UClPYpQn-JrgiCLepcCnn-dg,1,UgwXx5YSfxug8wS9OWh4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

To be quick, assuming capitalism continues, if you're already doing everything that you as a single consumer can do, then you can organize at the neighborhood to town level and collectively invest in solar panels and wind turbines. With some state laws, they'll make each of you money back on top of taking care of your electricity. People in the town of Harvard, Massachusetts bought themselves a communal solar array, and each of the original investors is now making money off of what the array sells back to the electric grid. Basically, you form a sunshine mining company. Getting electricity from your array deprives a coal power plant from those profits.

There's also waste to consider and beef produces a lot of waste, plants can actually help the air but there's also the pesticide usage, fertilizers, water waste, transportation, etc., while crickets need way less water and produce less waste.

Steel produced in coal-fired foundries for windmills, rare earths from polluting mines for solar panels, etc. They have no incentive to ACTUALLY help the environment because Capitalism sees the environment only as a source of capital. It has value only if it creates profit. Environmentalism only has value under capitalism if it creates profit. If a left wing government protects a forest from drilling by turning it into a tourist attraction, a right wing government could just as easily open it up for drilling and destroy it forever. Tourists aren't exactly ""green freaks"" either; they litter and start fires all the time. Some land is protected from mining and extraction because it's private - something Libertarians love. Philmont Scout Ranch is a great example of this. Unfortunately, it gets a lot of money from Philips 66, an oil company (they were created by the same guy). If Scouts BSA ever goes under, you bet companies will start clear cutting it. Even if it remains under Scouting's control and shakes its dependency on Philips 66, forest fires and water shortages-enhanced by climate change-have devastated it in recent years. Additionally, Capitalism thrives on artificial demands which offset any perceived efficiency, via Joven's paradox. Having more efficient computers, cars, and lights only encourages us to use them more. Substitutes can create problems too. Rockefeller's kerosene saved the whales, but oil spills and toxic emissions harm the environment far more. Bio fuel may net produce less carbon, but it also requires fertilizer and precious water. Capitalism doesn't care for a substitute's long term economic impact, only that it makes money. We can't save the environment with Capitalism.

Such messages evoke the impression that the only alternative to climate change happening is letting &quot;crazy extremists&quot; into power and some might rather fancy taking their chances with the former. Call me an optimist, but I do very much believe that there are many among the climate sceptic&quot; or those opposed to environmental measures who - somewhere deep in their heart - do feel that climate change might be real and would be willing to support some efforts to stop it, should one show them that there are also less radical measures to help hinder global warming. <br />Violently objecting or denying it seems like a very natural first reaction when someone claims there is a serious problem and completely giving up on their way of life is the only way to stop, but much less so if one offers more gradual reforms.",UCXBI_p0SZUE9oPYsEK0JM2w,0,UgzgQp5e0FXSaCD6G5J4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

GDP per hour worked and GDP per kg of CO2 emitted and GDP per unit of energy used have been consistently increasing. Growth is about using resources smarter, about innovation - not using more resources - and there is no real limit to that. Next, capitalism itself isn't the only system incentivising activities harmful to the environment - whenever you have someone in charge of an oil drilling operation, or responsible for the coal miners of some district, there is little reason to imagine they will be less motivated to try and suppress environmental protection measures. I'm also not sure which European non-left parties undermining environmental reforms you are talking about. For example, the German liberal (as in classical liberal/moderate libertarian) party FDP and the conservative/centre-right CDU both support advancing the European emission trading scheme and every major party, bar the alt-right one, are committed to the goals outlined in the Paris accord.

The main thing is the fact that you didn&#39;t villainize the corporations all that much. Well sure you said that they are responsible for the damage, but what you should do is to point us into direction of direct action not only against the climat change but against the cause of it which is the giant industry and bam you also have instantly a guy that nobody likes and who can work perfectly for the narrative and also deliver some much needed ancom agenda and this brings us to my second criticism of the video. Well i will give it to you the disfunction of capitalist system when it comes to fixing this problem was mentioned but what you should have done is double down on this and say that the only true solution to the problem is ending the existance of private companies in this sector once and for all, because realisticly that is the only way of dealing with climat change and some subtle reforms while still leaving it to the markets just wont do the job. <br />But overall as always loved your video.

Remember how to this day we're dealing with serious economic problems because after WW2 some people decided to have a few more children than normal? This created a large old generation that the smaller young population is having trouble supporting economically. You want to essentially cause a much worse version of this, plunging our societies into a demographic and economic disaster. Demographics need to decline steadily. And steady can still be relatively quickly, but for example a 1.0 birth rate is absolutely disastrous. 1.5-1.8 would be good if you ask me. That's relatively quick decline, but still steady enough to not cause any disasters. But I'm no demographic so perhaps even 1.5 is enough to cause a minor disaster, I don't know. All I do know is that such demographic changes can cause massive problems down the line, so it all has to stay steady. Our economy needs a young population big enough to fund social security for the elderly and less opportune members of society and if the balance is off, it all becomes too expensive and we could seriously just lose all those benefits we built up over decades as they become impossible to fund. This is unacceptable. As an example, here in the Netherlands we probably have what can be called the best pension system in the world, with currently a 1.5 trillion fund for just a few million pensioners (we're a country of 17 million in total and our pension fund is about 60% of what all of Europe has...), and even THAT system is in trouble because after WW2 more children were born than normal, so go figure how much of an impact demographic anomalies have on the economy. But yeah, to be sustainable we should absolutely think about letting our populations shrink. In Europe we already have a satisfactory birth rate of 1.7 or so, but unfortunately we import so many people from abroad that our already too high population is expanding anyway... Migration to fuel economic growth should stop. We've grown enough. Our economies should sooner shrink than grow further at this point. If our population shrinks our economy can shrink with it, maintaining our relative wealth but with a much lower carbon footprint due to lower population/smaller economy. Growth is all well and good, but only growth that is borne of innovation, not the kind of growth we get from an ever-increasing population and ever-expanding industrialisation and more. This might however create problems in terms of our political weight globally. Unless the entire world goes with us in this, shrinking your population too much can be geopolitical suicide... That's the annoying part in this. If we should do this, we forfeit our global political and economic weight. Imagine Europe with like 400-500 million people total (EU + the rest) against an Africa with its projected 2.5 billion people by 2050 (!) (for reference, it's now 750 million in Europe vs 1.3 billion in Africa). So instead our governments don't accept our low birth rates and overcompensate with mass migration to continue fuelling the economy. It's a race to the bottom that disregards what needs to be done ecologically in exchange for holding onto global power and influence. You either do the ecologically wrong thing and expand or you do the ecologically right thing and basically doom your society/civilisation to being politically and economically dominated by civilisations that did choose to expand. Globally we just need to stop. The birthrate in Europe is fine as is; at a steady decline. What is not fine is the birth rate in much of the third world. That issue absolutely is one of the main ecological problems of our time because there's a projected population explosion there with all due ecological (and humanitarian) problems. And indirectly they're causing Europe to aim for growth too. We need to bring third world birth rates down to our level, we've brought it down about as far as we can responsibly get it.",UC-XyypiErkvXliFisLqHHHA,1,UgyV-hAati0i_-47SFJ4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

The other problem with this, which you alluded to with the “refugee question” is that a racist solution to a climate crisis is very different than a anti-racist solution. Anti-racist solutions would likely focus on the root cause, climate change, and mitigating the damage caused by it by working together to save the planet. Racist solutions would likely subscribe to the zero-sum-game theory you described and attack symptoms: how to stop the ‘other’ from coming here and stealing our resources? Historically this question has largely been posed as an economic one, but increasingly money will be replaced by food, water, air and land. Racist solutions would not be categorically opposed to causing more damage to the planet if it meant it gave them an advantage over the ‘other’. This is a why a climate coalition will never work. They are incapable of collaborating in good faith because their mindset is predicated on their survival at the destruction of others.

It's also racist and just as likely to result in short-term solutions for 'the refugee question'. Personal theory: people have one of two views about the world when it comes to helping people. One group sees this as zero-sum. ""Every dollar spent on someone else is a dollar not spent on me."" This isn't just Scrooge, it's possible to think this way and be altruistic or even generous. I don't think there's a group of people who assume that nothing at all is zero-sum, and since I belong to this second group I obviously think we're right and the other way of thinking is wrong. Zero-sum thinking is the kind of truth that is so deeply embedded a premise that I think it's hard for people to imagine thinking of it any other way. It's not just racists, but it skews that way. When you try to convince a person who sees the world this way that they should act to avoid a future refugee crisis the basic problem is that you are not getting them angry at systems and institutions that are strip mining their future for a dollar that they will never see either. They get mad at the potential refugees and the next brown person who speaks something besides English in their presence. That's who took their dollar. When you leverage racism to encourage support for environmental policy you are reinforcing racism even if you don't believe white people are better. Related: anti racists aren't the opposite of racists. Racists want certain kinds of people to disappear. Anti racists want people to stop *doing* racism.

No plausible emissions scenario in any of the IPCC reports that i read (there is always a chance i missed something, of course) sugests that this might end all life on earth. Although the IPCC only deals with anthropogenic climate change and that is just one of many threats to the biosphere. So there's that. Don't get me wrong, i also for a time thought the same way. But as i read more about the subject i learned that, for example my fear that this could turn the earth into Venus is really not possible. There is not nearly close the amount of fossil fuels needed to get to those levels of CO2. But i'm not trying to downplay this either. I actually think a quick apocalypse would be better. We would have our ""i told you so"" moment, and then it would all just end. No more suffering. Peace an closure at last.  I fear it's even worse than this.

I don't think she would dispute this. The fact is that you and Natalie subscribe to different theories of gender. Your theory of gender is based on chromosomes* (even though you probably have zero knowledge of the chromosomes of every single person in your life, including yourself), whereas Natalie's theory of gender is not (as far as I'm aware) based on chromosomes. I'm not going to try and convince you that your theory of gender is dumb (although it really is). I am simply going to point out that you're a dick for purposely misgendering someone against their stated wishes. *You can argue that the ""chromosome-based theory of gender"" is more scientific, but there's a lot of reasons (many of them provided by Natalie/Contrapoints in other videos) to dispute this claim.

There's the ""one drop"" definition for example, which says that a person with even the tiniest amount of DNA from a non-white defined person is not properly white. Then there are Jews whose race is defined in various ways- only if your mother was Jewish according to some, but then in Hitler's Germany anyone with even one drop of Jewish blood was Jewish. People like you would claim that there is no such thing as being transgender, but at the same time may be very racist and keen to see racial differences and define people as being of another race. Rachel Dolezal may have claimed to be trans racial, but I didn't find one black person who believed it, she was no better than those blackfishing models like the Jenners and the Kardashians, or those white Instagram influencers who make themselves look black or racially ambiguous only because they want to appropriate ""black cool,"" while being able to cast off the black label anytime they like, never really having to suffer the difficulties of living as black person. All the time racists are labelling other people as being of different races so they can claim they are lesser people, they are claiming there is no such thing as being transgender because as far as they are concerned, lesser people are not allowed to define themselves. Trans people are not usually defined by transphobic people as transgender, they are defined by transphobes as perverted and wanting to abuse women etc. If someone wishes to define themselves as black, you won't find many racists objecting, they like more people to be black because that makes them more special.",UC5w9vnY_IFpUup6-TF4cutQ,1,UgyIrQ5doEmz2ZYF7OB4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

Plus, the hormone treatment for trans women does mean they lose muscle mass. And whether or not your claim about a trans woman giving a woman brain damage is true, I doubt that is the only case in MMA of brain damage being caused in a fight. It's kind of a thing that can happen, one of the hazards as in boxing. Just because you say a trans woman did it to a cis woman in a fight doesn't prove a thing about trans women. And I have to laugh at your statement that MMA is not as skilled as Traditional Martial Arts. You should try saying that on an MMA YouTube video, see what happens.

When I was younger I found it offensive, but since people always come up with new insults and insult us constantly you kinda just have to accept it (otherwise you get called delusional) so I use it as a joke to describe myself now. I'm sure other trans people find it offensive still but I'm at a point where I just have to stop trying to convince people what we go through otherwise I'd always be upset. I think the important thing to remember is yes jokes help bridge understandings amongst people but cis people have no clue how to joke about us without it sounding offensive. I feel like only trans people know how to joke about ourselves because we are a super small minority that most people don't understand or even want to understand. Also there's always going to be different opinions on this because young trans people are going through puberty so they are very emotional and sensitive so add that in the pile and you have a lot of instability which makes cis people see us in an even worse light. People need to remember that we are all individuals going through individual issues and we don't really have a community that we relate with as a whole because we are all going through different stages of transition and mindsets. For example I pass have had srs and i see myself as a female because my behavior naturally is very ""binary"" gender role wise. Which I feel because this is getting so complicated the only way to treat us seriously and with respect is if we get diagnosed properly by doctors. Iv'e gone to multiple doctors and they all diagnosed me with this condition. When I see people who transition and don't treat it seriously I get offended. People who are genderqueer insult me and call me truscum because I was diagnosed with the condition and took all the right steps. Unfortunately since most people in my age group (I'm 26 now started at 18) did not have access to proper treatment because society treated us even worse back then compared to now (still pretty bad and young transitioners are blissfully ignorant about it). A lot of us had to transition through unofficial channels (mix in genderqueer, and transtrenders) and you get a whole mess of confusion for cis people. Hopefully because it's more well known now younger transitions get diagnosed properly now but everyone who hates us constantly says but kids don't know what they want yes I agree that's why you go to a doctor who knows what they are talking about to diagnose you. Go to multiple doctors the process is not easy and challenging but in the end you will know who you are if you transition properly. I am afraid we are riding on a wave of acceptance only to fall in a decade or so because people are not getting diagnosed properly so I feel a lot of de-transitioners will happen in a decade or so. Back then the word transsexual was akin to crossdressing. I was so confused about how I felt and could never figure out why people did not want to interact with me boys or girls. I started having vivid dreams of being a girl at age 10-16 however because I was raised in a conservative household I repressed until age 16 and that was when the dreams really hit me hard and I came across the word transgender online it described my experience to the point of clarity. I knew what I had to do but the steps I had to take were monumental and I was still unsure if that is what I was because society made me repress for so long all these feelings while having to deal with a time clock because I knew If that was what I was I needed to transition before puberty ruined my life. Fortunately I was one of the lucky ones in my generation. However that does not mean I can find a stable job to this day because all the issues I went through had huge loss as well. I still feel huge amounts of anxiety from all the shit I went through and society has socially outcasted me. If I was being serious I would not use offensive terminology. For me going through this while trying to interact with a world that has no clue what I go through is like first contact. I'm always worried about what people will do or think when I tell them I am trans or if they find out somehow on their own because the risk can result in getting beaten up, raped, killed, or if I am lucky just socially outcasted. The 40% suicide rate is there because we deal with so much shit on a day to day basis. But people use it as a reason why transition is a bad thing because the number doesn't go down after transition. It does not go down because society and the world at large treats us like sub humans. For me personally I probably would be dead If I never transitioned. Sorry this turned into a long story but when you are trans one explanation has to lead to another it seems... And I am only now opening myself up to people because I feel a shift in society right now. I could be wrong and I am just fucking myself over by revealing all this. But I am a freak in societies eyes already anyways.",UC7BeRsTpA2vbFaWmF96KNKg,1,Ugz7T5tEApI-bVhlEqB4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

The issue is that people don't care about the climate when they are starving and without electricity because they had to pay rent. Poor people don't care about the future decades when they are barely surviving tomorrow. The reason the republicans can use climat change is not because people are pro-global warming. but because they have successfully painted it as elite liberal hobbies which are damaging the companies the working class is dependent on. so first we break up that dependence. Fcus on the economy, unfuck the us and get a platform to work on. Of course in the process of breaking up big business you can also work on climate in the background but it just isn't a voting issue. then if people are living well you can do the whole ""preserve for your children/make sure you have a good old day"" spiel to get more popularity though it is still an issue that people don't care about the future and prefer to fix rather than to prevent. another point which I do have to compliment Contra on is that the whole ""You can fix climate change"" thing is bollocks and feeds resentment and thus ought to be limited though and abrupt stop would cause backlash. now one book later onto the second question The thing is, Contra herself is an excellent example on this topic if you look at her dialogue videos like ""punching nastees"", ""the left"" and ""the aesthetic"". These were an interesting discussion on topics where two sides were presented fairly but not neccesarily evenly. there was a point but because there was room for counterpoint and because all arguments were on the table it didn't feel ranty. This on the other hand is a one-sided situation where due to the ""documentary"" one of the characters had way more screen time. It's ...I forgot the names... the nerd explaining something. the bourgoise? squibbing and the nerd saying no and continuing to another topic. Instead of a dialogue it is an author surrogate ranting to an audience surrogate. of course that doesn't mean I support both-sideism. there is a clear truth in climate change. But for this video it would be more interesting to explore why the wider public ignores it and how we can change messaging rather than to hammer on what is kind of a left-wing strawman of the upper-class. So In tl;dr. climate change is to high on maslow's pyramid to care about so first fix the base issues. Also, be careful with your presentation that both characters get a say and one is not overrun even if there is a clear truth because it tends to push people away.",UC53ezeQUMdon7MHn2cuRNQA,1,UgxOJXIrHYOwM575oDd4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

It's not a rhetorical question - it just comes from skepticism that the answer can be something other than ""no"". Trump's committed to climate change denialism and he's a major roadblock to the Republican ""news"" universe ever getting out of that rut. (Though hardly the only source of inertia that way.)

However while the movie contained a couple of errors and a few things which could have been explained better climate scientists have generally praised Gore for getting the science right. If he did say that about Mars then that would be an error but it certainly wasn’t in the movie. When I look at the things pseudoskeptics accuse Gore of saying 95% of it ends up being false reports of what he said. Like I said he generally gets the science correct. Where he did go wrong was making himself such a political liability by having that energy sucking house and being too personally attached to carbon markets. Carbon markets and carbon credits aren’t inherently bad but it allowed others to present him as being in it for the money and hypocritical.

Most of the crap wasn't that extreme, more like misrepresentation, but it gives enormous ammunition to deniers. Gore claimed to ""work with"" scientists on the issue, but in reality, he took some basic science classes from them in college, like many non science majors do.

As a major offender, you &quot;debunk&quot; the no consensus argument with the 97% of climate scientists figure. Besides multiple of the authors of papers cited claiming their findings to have being misrepresented, the argument was that there&#39;s no consensus on future climate trends -which, as of right now, there isn&#39;t-, not on the anthropogenic nature of current climate trends. Another point was the argument of climate change having stopped, also &quot;debunked&quot; in the website you linked; this argument actually never existed. What they may be trying to address is the fact that the rate of increase of global temperatures having stopped since the late 90s. While some Alex Jones types may make outrageous arguments, it is deeply irresponsible to take these as representatives of climate skepticism. This is equivalent to Ben Shapiro claiming that your birth genitals define your gender because transitioning doesn&#39;t change your biological sex, and it just so happens that Riley Dennis considers herself to be a female.

If we go to far left the government will become the sole decision making body that everyone has to listen to. That does not excuse the issues that capitalism has but the other extreme is also scary. In the end politics are always driven by families who are powerful at the time (doesn't matter if it's left or right). I do agree that we need to focus on helping people right now because most conservatives i'm learning are very bigoted towards minorities. I am just afraid of both sides. And for me at least the current system right now allows us to discuss whatever we want online I do not think minorities like trans people would even have a platform if it wasn't for the current system (as backwards as that sounds). My fear comes from seeing how suppressing more extreme forms of the left are. They don't realize that they are also hypocritical because they only listen to what they want. I have experienced this first hand on how they twist and bend what transsexualism actually is (I am in their view a truscum). Although more research is required because I do believe gender queer identities are valid I just believe it is completely separate from full on gender reassignment. My life, everyone assumed I was a boy when my behavior in general was not and no one recognized it my entire life and because of that my life was a swirling vex of confusion until I finally got diagnosed. Genderqueer identities have no respect towards this experience and they have taken over the definition of transsexualism to the point that I don't even feel comfortable calling myself that anymore. They do this with a lot of other stuff as well because I see the same patterns in issues when I observe the gaming industry and other (hobbies I grew up with). Always their view only and no one elses. They have a very narrow perspective on life and have embraced post modernism quite literally. They do not believe in nature or absolutes. They believe in language and the free flow of ideas well... only their ideas. I do however agree with how compartmentalized science can be sometimes. We still do not know very much about how sex development works in humans but we all act like we know because chromosomes man. That is only the tip of the iceberg my friends. Not to imply it's scary but there is a lot more than just chromosomes. It is difficult even for me to comprehend how someone can switch their gender on a fly because if I did that I'd get dysphoric as fuck and break down crying. My experience is constant theirs is not and there is a total lack of respect and understanding they refuse to acknowledge. But I digress. We need to approach change slowly otherwise people will take advantage of a fast changing system. I guess unfortunately sometimes life requires extremes. Life is a complicated beast in general. This is only my experience with life so far. The best thing you can do is to always have an inquisitive open mind otherwise no discussion will happen and nothing gets done other than bickering all day.",UC7BeRsTpA2vbFaWmF96KNKg,1,Ugz6pXBiQMgsFtMMKrJ4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

Rynn Berry's Hitler: Neither Vegetarian Nor Animal Lover describes how Goebbels, The Third Reich's propaganda minister, tried to sell Hitler as a vegetarian to make him seem as peaceful as Gandhi, who was (and still is) adored by the world. Check out Berry's March 8, 2007 letter to the New York Times below, where he proves—beyond a reasonable doubt— what the top Nazis ate. The Letter by Rynn Berry Thursday, March 8, 2007 The Editor The New York Times Book Review 229 West 43rd Street New York, NY 10036 To the Editor, I must take issue with Mr. Rothstein's glib characterization of Hitler and his Nazi henchmen, Hess, and Himmler, as vegetarians, in his review of Tristram Stuart's The Bloodless Revolution (February 25). As the historical advisor to the North American Vegetarian Society, I am constantly being taxed with having to explain Hitler's alleged vegetarianism. In researching the matter, I discovered that Hitler was not a true vegetarian. I presented my findings in a book entitled Hitler: Neither Vegetarian Nor Animal Lover (Pythagorean Publishers, 2004). In my book, I cite numerous primary sources that attest that Hitler was not a thoroughgoing vegetarian. Here are a few examples: For instance, one of his closest friends, Frau Hess, asserted that Hitler was a strict vegetarian except for Liver Dumplings. “From that moment on, Hitler never ate another piece of meat, except for liver dumplings.” (His habitual eating of liver dumplings is an important exception that disqualifies Hitler as vegetarian.) Chef Dione Lucas, who used routinely to prepare meals for him into the early 1930s, actually published Hitler's favorite recipes in her cookbook, The Gourmet Cooking School Cookbook (1964, p. 89). “, Germany. I do not mean to spoil your appetite for stuffed squab, but you might be interested to know that it was a grI learned the recipe when I worked as a chef before World War II, in one of the large hotels in Hamburgeat favorite with Mr. Hitler who dined at the hotel often. Let us not hold that against a fine recipe though.” (His habitual eating of stuffed squab disqualifies Hitler as a vegetarian.) In the New York Times of May 30, 1937, in an article entitled “Where Hitler Dreams and Plans,” Times reporter Otto D. Tolschuss wrote, “It is well known that Hitler is vegetarian and does not drink or smoke. His lunch and dinner consist, therefore, for the most part of soup, eggs, vegetables and mineral water, although he occasionally relishes a slice of ham and relieves the tediousness of his diet with such delicacies as caviar, luscious fruits and similar tidbits.” (His occasional eating of sliced ham and caviar disqualifies Hitler as a vegetarian.) Hitler biographer Thomas Fuchs, in his book, A Concise Biography of Adolf Hitler (New York: Berkeley, 2000, p.78), also confirms that Hitler was not a vegetarian. “A typical day's consumption included eggs prepared in any number of ways, spaghetti, baked potatoes with cottage cheese, oatmeal, stewed fruits and vegetable puddings. Meat was not completely excluded. Hitler continued to eat a favorite dish, Leberkloesse (liver dumplings).” To be sure, Hitler professed to be a vegetarian (in section 66 of Hitler's Table Talk, 1941-44), but the primary sources that I have cited in my book show that while he paid lip service to vegetarianism, he was not consistent in his practice of the diet. “Vegetarian”—which means (according to the standard dictionary definition) “the practice of eating only vegetables and refraining from eating meat, fish, or other animal products”—is like that other V word, Virgin: you either are one, or you are not. By that criterion, Hitler was a quasi-vegetarian, a would-be vegetarian, or a flexitarian. He was decidedly not a true vegetarian. Rynn Berry Authors have questioned Hitler's commitment to the vegetarian cause due to the Nazi ban on vegetarian societies and the persecution of their leaders.",UCUYJ5slSs3EYDCwnIZKOyow,1,UgxVqqNqrXZxR3rM1qV4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

Nobody is perfect so we can't rely on leaders and democracy is flawed because it is only as good as the average person in society and spiritual awakenings are fantasies that end up doing more harm than good. Killing people doesn't work to create a better society, because that doesn't elevate anyone's morality; the communist regime of Russia wasn't much better than the Tsarists that came before. Also, major conflicts will likely increase emissions, so unless you think people can fight the global power structure and win in a reasonable amount of time then that is a dead end proposition. And if that happens do you think people will know how to restructure society in order to stop climate change while fulfilling people's basic needs?

Let us do the thinking!_ Because theres absolutely nothing to gain out of a massive majority of people singong the same songs, marching to the same beat, and shouting down in unison, any one or two or few who DARE become voices of dissent by questioning our _chorus of consensus._ I've read data from all sodes of this argument, from guys who built a scientific model meant to give us data on the actual effects of nuclear winter by collating data from massive volcanic eruptions to former green peace types who were down tmwoth saving the whales but became disenchanted when that wasnt enough and suddenly they find themselves on environmental crusades on the HUNT for the next doomsday environmental disaster and putting just as much effort into putting witch hunts and litigations upon those who dare question it. Anything that becomes an _INDUSTRY_ is subject to _MISTRUST_ With even the most rudimentary of Pattern Recognition, it becomes clear that someone claiming to be on the righteous side of divine truth s using things like mass media with unlimited funding and corporate sponsorship/celebrity endorsement/goes through every mass media channel from magazines and comics to books, movies and talk shows to spread ' the gospel' and that judgement day - the end of days is just around the corner --- Blahblahblahblah So! Because religion and Scientology have pushed their message with the exact same methods, maybe just maybe there's room to investigate doubt in said groups motives - especially when methods deployed by said group have been used again and again and again and again by every holy roller and science fiction writer to create whole systems of belief using all the same tools of psychogical warfare on all the masses.

"" Science routinely gets wrong the rate and effect of climate change and the countereffect of our policies to change it."" Okay, NOW you are switching gears and talking about Climate science being the issue. ""And yet you pretend as if brain scans showing a mental abnormality in the brains of trans people aka what we already knew as gender dysphoria and treated as a mental condition you pretend is more valid than the incredibly vague and routinely wrong research on the timing effects and policy solution by climate scientists."""" Regarding the ""abnormality"" assertion it was once the case with homosexuality, but now that has changed. Mental disorders are such when they cause distress, and while distress is often reported with those who identify as trans it;s hard to disentangle rather it's the condition itself or responses from others regarding it. What the brain images specifically show were similarities in structure between trans cis correspondents, validating the mental designation of gender. It didn;t how maladities. "" That's just your own personal bias in action which is why when it comes to people who don't think paying 10 bucks a gallon for gas is a good idea for the economy vs some schmuck who gets a snowball and says climate change isnt real you choose to engage the snowball man. Because it's your own predisposition. You choose the simpleton to argue against then when it comes to basic biology settled science you ask that we look into nuanced arguments. It's just disingenuous."" It's not my ""personal bias"" or ""nuanced arguments"" on what I said on the ""validity"" of trans versus cis. The terminology is already adopted, and the study showed evidence for the mental structure of gender. If you have studies that show the opposite then we can discuss it. Your ""versus"" example at this point is out of place. I don't think it's a good idea to go with bad policies like the one you gave, at the same time that doesn;t make ""simpletons"" (your word, not mine) any less of an issue when even getting to the point of policies. ""Yes I know she did talk about pronouns and free speech which is why shes the only sjw I can tolerate."" In the other comment you listed her as an example of one who is a hypocrite who ignores policies, which is it? ""Yeah if you look up chemtrails and lizard people you will find a whole bunch of people who believe in it and you'll think the conspiracies are on the increase but then you take a look at the general public and realize it's your own confirmation bias. Lol the fact you name off 2 things that sound like brands of graphics cards that have no mainstream name recognition and expect that to be some kind of silver bullet is hilarious."" Actually, it's you confusing rate of popularity versus percentage of popularity. For instance, a disease could be rare among the general public but can still increase. When you say ""two things"" I assume you refer to Quora and the graph. Quora is a social media tool filled with people would would engage in answering questions and an obvious forum of conversation where one can find people expressing their views. Not to mention I also referred to private ""educational"" institutions. As for the FE, see it for yourself. https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2017/11/28/americas-flat-earth-movement-appears-to-be-growing I was only incorrect with the spike being around 2015, not 2010. ""Oh do you really need me to pull up the stats on how much excessive consumption westerners partake in against basic living conditions in the third world? I didnt think I needed to. Lol a cell phone internet and car arent basic necessities for human life and yet climate change champions will consume more than hundreds of ethiopians living their awesome life while chastising others for doing the same. Do I need to give you the average consumed resources by a westerner vs an Ethiopian? Do I really?"" No, because you're not even controlling your samples. You say westerners consume more, when that's obviously inevitable due to the infrastructure of 1st world society. The problem here is comparing westerners AWARE of emissions versus westerners who aren't or don't care. Until then you've proved nothing. ""Lastly nothing I said was unclear you just did exactly what I said you would do. You take the path of least resistance instead of challenging the strong argument. In this case its pretending you dont understand what I'm saying in the climate change debate its choosing to argue against the snowball guy instead of the economist."" I do understand what you are saying, I said you haven't proven anything. You claim that I confirmed my bias while you gave no statistics on the popularity of the beliefs among the general public and only referred to your experience.

The actual issue, that is not the ""important"" issue but the one being discussed, is the rampancy of denial. I did not say those who focused on the solvency of policies were minor. What I meant was that simply categorizing the issue as one on policy rather than one on the facts themselves is unconvincing. It's no secret. It used to be mainly creationists, then it was Climate change, now it's the earth is flat. Each propose a conspiracy and each are gaining focus. 2. You label those such as contrapoints as being ""excessive"", though in the context of their position it would depend on their total and/or proportional output. I didn't say it explicitly, but I was expecting some sort of logic or evidence that would support them being excessive . And with that said, as for your ""confirmation bias point"", what measurement are YOU using to declare ""policy, not the facts""? I can only assume it's been your experience, but the immediate problem is that I have my experiences to suggest otherwise. ""And I'll call you steve shives. Or we can not do that. Your call."" This escalated pretty fast. I may've disagreed with you but I was careful enough to avoid insults/generalizing. I won't pander so I'll refer to my points above. ""It's irrelevant. The fact is the same people who screech about climate change needing economic destruction in normal peoples lives to mend are the same people consuming as much if not more than those people in those countries. I dont pretend to be an animal rights activist while working at a factory farm because I'd be a hypocrite. gluttonously consuming as much as everyone else and complaining that everyone else is destroying the planet is a joke."" It's funny how you are committing the same fallacy as the confirmation bias you described. You begin with your conclusion without actually justifying it. I'll ask again, my second point, how do you know this?

It happens during periods of _thousands_ of years. If you think dumping 2.4 million pounds of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every second doesn't make a dent, I invite you to lock yourself in a large, large room with no windows and get the proportional amount pumped inside it so you can test it yourself. Just make sure the door isn't sealed shut so you can leave at your convenience. And if you don't believe in some person in a lab coat, maybe stop using antibiotics (any kind of medicine, really), microwaves, cellphones, television screens, cars, the internet and all modern conveniences created by other people in lab coats, because apparently they know nothing, so why should you believe them? Don't use their stuff, it's a lie. In fact, get out of the internet right now. The issue is not whether the Earth will make it - oh, it fucking will, be sure of that. Several other species do fine in harsh environments, life will go on. People won't, though. Because this is not just about expecting a few hot days or some harsher winters (global warming makes harsher winters, in case you're not aware), it's about how draughts will affect the global economy, how wars will start when people need to emigrate because they can no longer grow enough food, how resources _will_ dwindle. So if you're willing to stand in the fire and complain it's hot, that's your perogative. Just don't expect there won't be a scientist suggesting you stop dumping gasoline on it and instead start thinking of putting the fire out. And other people thinking the scientist does have a point. _""We weren't there to record it!""_ This is you admitting you know jack shit about geology and chemistry or how sedimental layers work. This is you showing your shocking ignorance.

People like @Marc Thompson dismiss everyone that doesn't agree as possessing or in the neighborhood of possessing the Dunning-Kruger effect. It's condescending at it's core. It automatically puts people on the defensive. Yes, that shouldn't matter, but unfortunately, facts don't happen in a vacuum. People get offended, they dig in and nothing gets accomplished. When you present things as ""us against them,"" any mistake the opposite side makes, means they are ""completely wrong."" Really it's just an excuse to dismiss, but then perception becomes reality. Remember how the left has and still clings to ""vaccines are evil,"" ""gluten is going to kill us all"" etc? When you take extreme stances you can't be surprised if your opponent takes an opposing, but just as extreme stance. Also, both of those things aren't true. 2. This, however is minor in comparison to the power corporations, who have a clear reason and the capital to push easily digestible propaganda at an alarming rate and buy the politicians to to set agendas. So when the masses eat it up and what's on the other side is dry ""science talk"" coupled with the ""high and mighty left,"" why would you expect people to listen? 3. Neither of these are as bad as the very true point Natalie made when she said capitalism is not equipped to handle this. One of the more hidden aspects from the negatives of capitalism is the impact it has on scientific studies. Scientists in the US, the world leader in scientific research and technological development, don't operate outside of capitalism. Their profession may have an elevated moral status, but the individuals that work in them still have mortgages, car notes, and families to feed and clothe. Very rarely does research fund itself. It's usually an outside investor that has an agenda, be it social, political or financial. There's not enough money to go around and the number of people interested in entering the scientific fields has exploded over the last 60 year. This means competition for grants and jobs. Jobs that are often dependent on previous work and keeping it based on results. Scientists are just as susceptible to pressure, bias, bribes fame, pride, self-deception and corruption as you or I. https://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2015/10/16/449091753/research-methods-and-bias-in-science https://www.nature.com/news/how-scientists-fool-themselves-and-how-they-can-stop-1.18517 http://sciencenordic.com/science-has-always-been-driven-money This raises the real questions then: *How many studies truly went through the peer review process? Research has shown that there are a litany of problems with peer review in the scientific community, even if you set aside greed and competition.* http://www.michaeleisen.org/blog/?p=1439 http://www.columbia.edu/cu/21stC/issue-1.1/peer.htm https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1420798/ https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/opinion-scientific-peer-review-in-crisis-39728 https://newrepublic.com/article/135921/science-suffering-peer-reviews-big-problems https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/bogus-science-paper-reveals-peer-review-s-flaws-1.2054004 https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/peer-reviews-1.4907377 Yes, there is may be a consensus on a topic, but how many in that consensus did their own research and didn't take shortcuts, another common human trait? How many truly understand what they supposed to be researching and all the aspects of it? You don't think there C and D students that are professional scientists today? *Ever here of the nonsense math effect?* http://journal.sjdm.org/12/12810/jdm12810.html And what about studies that can't be replicated, but get through ""peer review"" anyway? https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2015/08/27/trouble-in-science-massive-effort-to-reproduce-100-experimental-results-succeeds-only-36-times/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.db3040545fb6 Now add all that to our natural makeup as imperfect, overly driven by emotion creatures usually capable of only dealing with immediate problems. Mix in a big ol heaping of news anchors saying, ""Scientists are now saying..."" and you have an understandable recipe for why faith in the scientific community is where it is. *TL;DR People don't have faith in science because it's dry, people who think they're smart are condescending, there are serious flaws in scientific studies, especially peer review and capitalism creates competition in a field were there should be none.

Look, you're getting paid either way, why would it matter how much? Science (unlike religion) doesn't claim to have *perfect* answers. but it does offer the best available predictions we can make, and (unlike religion) can be falsified and even things that we consider bedrock laws of how things work are subject to new discoveries that put them into dispute. So why don't we stop everything any time a single finding contradicts it? Well, first because no one has time for that shit, and as we see here, not acting isn't a non-decision. It's continuing with the current momentum. We judge validity in science based on predictive value. Most of us can recognize why that matters when building a car even if we can't follow the details. Or powering the screen you're looking at. I could smash that screen with a hammer and the cosmos doesn't give a damn. So, yes, science doesn't tell us that we should do something about climate change. What it tells us about is what we can expect to see if we don't.

Yes, Scientists can be wrong, but we cannot really expect people to research everything themselves. Firstly, because they are not equipped to do so (most of the research is written for experts not laymen) and secondly because it is simply too much. As an example, I tried to find research on whether oral irrigators are as effective as flossing and even that brought me to the brink of insanity - now let a layperson research stuff that really matters and see how that goes. And while researchers can be wrong sometimes, there is something far more dangerous: we are developing towards a frightening skepticism regarding scientific (and even peer-reviewed) research which only worsens the problem at hand (as Contrapoints so wonderfully illustrated). It is indeed something that is discussed among some researches at the moment: how can we make our findings understandable for everyone? Would people even care to read them? Would it even be possible to break it down without simplifying too much? Contrapoints is a wonderful example of how to process information so it becomes understandable (and entertaining to boot) but what would be the incentive for the scientist to invest all this work?

Companies that don&#39;t adapt to changes in the market *do go under*, it is not unheard of, capitalism isn&#39;t too big to fail... and from their ashes new companies arise to exploit the market. We just need to keep making sure to control our demand so that it doesn&#39;t support exploitation. <br />3. voting for a different president would be good, but it&#39;s not like Obama did so much for the environment... as much as anti-capitalists like to say otherwise, the money vote is the strongest vote people have. Politicians will make promises they will 90% of the time not keep or even go against them. Many of them are bought out by the lobbyists. So again, using your wallet is the best vote you have. <br />4. anti-capitalists will say that the corporations will just find a way around and continue exploitation... to a certain degree, yes... but eventually the pressure will be too great and they will have to adapt or go under to be replaced by new companies that have adapted. These mega corporations are rich because we make them rich. They can stop being rich if we stop making them rich until they change their ways or go under. <br /> <br />Now I am not one to say capitalism is perfect, far be it... and a new system needs to be implemented if we reduce scarcity enough using new technologies... but until then, in the current system, a dollar vote is more powerful in my opinion than a political vote, but sure - why not do both? <br /> <br />Also, does this mean you&#39;re vegan now, Natalie?",UCe-XmWygQk6DThNR5kuM5YQ,0,UgzbVHv1Y17ee9nX0c14AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

Regulations might happen, might not, might work, might not... but if people stopped buying x product then x product would stop being made. Practically, changing people's minds especially collectively is very hard. But take cigarettes as an example. First came the research. Then the public protest. Then the government regulated warning us of cigarette damage. And people still buy cigarettes anyway, but much much less than before. The regulations came from the public making individual choices. Wars - an all out war can't be commited without risk of revolt if public opinion is not in favor of it. Public opinion can be manipulated and people still buy cigarettes despite the known health risks. Products like cigarettes, processed food and animal food prey on our instincts to eat the most calorie dense food available. It would be easiest for public health if they were made illegal and did not exist, but freedom of choice is also important to us. So at the end of the day, since politics is influenced more by money, the only way we can do to animal foods what we did to cigarettes is making collective individual choices that will force corporations and the government to respond. And it's very difficult because everyone is biased towards maintaining their bad habits and making excuses why meat is essential for health just like they once did with cigarettes and doctors recommending them for health. My point is Natalie makes it seem as if voting with our money is useless when I think that if performed collectively it is way more powerful than a political vote. Problem is getting there, but it is technically possible to do now, no one is stopping us except us. In the end humanity will live and die by our collective choices, the corporations and goverments will bend to those choices, they will have to.",UCe-XmWygQk6DThNR5kuM5YQ,1,UgzbVHv1Y17ee9nX0c14AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

There are other kinds of freedom that a government can guarantee and encourage and protect besides our freedom to buy as much bullshit as companies want us to. Is a person freer if she gets to follow her dreams and work towards goals and ends that are genuinely inspiring, rather than having to work only to pay the bills? Is a person freer if she dares to speak her mind in every situation, rather than feeling she has to hold back in order to avoid the judgment and disdain of others? Is a person freer if she feels that she is a responsible participant of her community and society, rather than a passive onlooker? Is a person freer if she can make life choices without fearing for her financial security? Is a person freer if she can walk down the street and meet no beggars, see less social misery and not have her mind filled with commercials vying for her time, attention and money? Is a person freer if she consumes goods and services in order to do something she believes in rather than acting out of inner insecurities? Is a person freer if her mind is affected by less cognitive biases and prejudices? Is a person freer if she makes most of her choices in a calm, harmonious state of mind rather than a stressed, anxious one? Is a person freer if she has many different positive identities to choose from, so that if she fails in one regard, she may still flourish in another?

Look at how markets price oil. The price of oil doesn't reflect the fact that it's a finite resource that may be running out. It doesn't even reflect the fact that it's a dangerous substance that is causing significant harm to the whole biosphere. All that the price of oil reflects is what people are willing to pay for it. Markets will create abundance even when abundance is not the answer, and when it comes to climate change, pollution, and resource scarcity, abundance is definitely not the answer. Renewable energy simply is not as effective as the energy provided by petrochemicals. Maybe, just maybe, it might be so in the future (but at the moment that's as faith-based as believing in heaven, and trusting faith in this situation is stupid) - but it's at least as likely that it won't be, and if that's the case our sustainable world will see us having to make do with less energy, stuff, and stimulation (though if the energy, stuff and stimulation was more reasonably distributed than it is at present that could be less of a blow than it seems like today). The market is not a good tool for distributing that kind of shift even in an unfair manner, and it is much, much worse for distributing it in a fair manner. Markets are great in some contexts, but they're not a Swiss army knife, and as far as I'm concerned the people who treat them like one are the sort of capitalist that I think Matrim42 was talking about.",UCDRIf922eeh5QR0wch7hwbA,1,Ugxb1aj7MX9ThI4K3Ox4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

Catholics and Mainline Protestants do tend to be better about it. There are several reasons why most Evangelicals are such climate change deniers, from the strong distrust of accepted science (because it conflicts with their literalistic readings of Genesis), to the strong conservative distrust of and paranoia about the ""liberal media,"" to thinking the rainbow after the flood in the flood story means humans couldn't seriously damage the earth, to having embraced an eschatology that is gleeful about the world ending, to the general anxiety and reactionary attitude they have about most everything outside of their subculture.This is coming from someone who was raised Evangelical, and has a lot of experience with that world. Evangelicals have somewhat been taken in by Big Oil (via Republican politicians and ""Heritage Foundation-style"" conservative ideology), but they also have a very toxic worldview (anti-LGBT, subtly/not-so-subtly racist, etc.) that this plays into. I mean the reason Evangelicals are the most pro-Israel demographic in the U.S. is not because they care about the wellbeing of the Jewish people, but because some, though not all, Evangelicals think it's necessary for the fulfillment of prophecies so the end of the world will happen, which they really want to happen soon. They have a pretty depressing outlook on life. And they're a quarter of the U.S. population, and non-Hispanic White Evangelicals are the most pro-Trump demographic. So yeah.

I used to watch South Park when I was an edgy teen as well (at the time, I was really dissatisfied with gender expectations and therefore thought it was a good series just because it used curse words), and I stopped caring about it as soon as I got involved in feminism. However, I recently found the following tweets, and they really led me to reflect on the way “South Park” shaped my thinking as a kid: https://mobile.twitter.com/gryphoenix1/status/1060561519845560320 I could not agree more. For example, the “Safe Space” episode – one of the last ones I watched – left me with a completely inaccurate understanding of what safe spaces are (I don’t actually live in the US, so I basically had to take their word for it and couldn’t form my own opinion through personal experience). Even though I never consciously identified as an anti-feminist, the immense transphobia and in particular the complete hostility towards any type of social change definitely manifested itself in my mind, and so did many pretty reactionary attitudes – I will use the “The F Word” episode as an illustrative example, and it indeed led me to defend the use of homosexual and misogynistic slurs because it supposedly isn’t actually meant literally. What twelve-year-old me failed to realize is that, by using those terms (or defending their use) in different contexts, I associate their traditional meaning with the given circumstance, both implying the pejorative nature of the original and enforcing related notions. It’s not just that “South Park” is edgy trash for stupid children who don’t know any better and will eventually become more mature, growing out of the phase. Indeed, the series has played a major role in building up neo-reactionary attitudes among the youth. I would be surprised if the series hadn’t also shaped the attitude of many people in the anti-feminist community on YouTube towards social justice.",UCVcaYYawXzN3Fetd3Tq81VQ,1,UgzbO7m2Ux1N-fXeFUl4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

Because that was actually a big part of my argument that you decided to fully ignore and a problem with being a pure vegan, if your health is fine with your diet and supplements, good for you, if you are happy that is great. But do not be smug about it, or act like anyone not following your ideals have moral issues which was what the original poster said and I commented on. And I can easily say the opposite of what you just said, there are thousands of people that are pure vegan that suffer from health conditions so what I said was not proven wrong, I know fully well there are pure vegans who are not suffering any issues at all because they are actually taking pills/powders etc to deal with the things a vegan diet will never give them, my issue is when that involves children. A teenager should not be developing medical conditions due to a poor diet during their childhood, this btw also applies to people who feed their kids junk and little to no plants as well as to much sugar so my issue is not directed soley on vegans. A varied food intake has always been and always will be the better choice for most people, your personal choices are your own, it does not make non vegans wrong, again if you are fine then good for you, going vegan is not easy as there are a lot of things a person needs to know or they will hurt their body in the long run. It is not something I would agree with a childs diet being unless a medical condition cuts major food groups from their diet, which do exist. The fact either way is that there has not been a major long term study of the potential long term problems, we only know it does effect a childs growth rate on multiple levels but even those studies are low on data, the main concerns are bones, muscles and neurological, muscle growth and maintaining them has been the easiest to spot in pure vegans entering their teenage years, the lack of an easy source of easily digested fat is also a worrry for growing children, some research has spotted some damage to the neurological parts of the body which is the biggest worry, a lot of pure vegan children also have issues with energy which even adults can have an issue with if they are vegan, this is far worse for a growing child though due to the amount of energy they need to grow and need to build and maintain their body, this especially hits hard during puberty. Potentially it increases the risks of certain conditions later in life but that is speculated and not proven since there really is no data to look at. Again my issue is for growing children, I have no problem with a person wanting to be vegan or a vegetarian as long as they are happy and healthy. I will close with adding that eggs are still extremely vital to humanity as a very easy to store food that also contains a ton of easy to digest nutrients, protein and vitamins, in one tiny package, it is near impossible to deny that fact, one vs multiple to reach the same amount, you cannot argue against the massive benefit eggs have, for the poor they can be one of the most vital parts of their food intake.",UC6aQgduVSU6ZfOa2-kNM7Tw,1,UgzV85-rum13mHx_UNB4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

Because that was what I was commenting on, pure plant diets, not vegetarian diets which usually still include fish and dairy products. You know as well as I do that there are a ton of people who have said there are benefits to a vegetarian diet and I will agree with that, pure veganism is not in that ballpark for one single reason, you cannot be 100% healthy without using supplements. Vegetarian is not the same as a pure vegan in case you do not see the difference. It is physically impossible to reach the recommended levels of multiple things a healthy human needs in their diet unless they are also taken via supplaments or food products with it added, while a vegetarian can still get everything they need without needing that. A lot of medical resarchers have over decades at this point made records of various effects a pure vegan diet can have on a growing child, none of it is conclusive but there are several that have noted that it does likely effect bones, muscles blood and neural paths, the majority of nutritionists recommend a healthy varied diet or a vegetarian diet with dairy and fish. If you come back and claim you are 100% only on a plant diet with no supplements with zero health issues or lack of certain things in your body, I am going to call you full of shit.

Changing your diet to be more aimed at pork and poultry is on the overall better, as horrible as the animal conditions are for those two overall, soy is better then milk in a lot of ways one being that a lot of humanity is not able to digest it, cheese and butter though generally do not have that issue since depending on the type there really is not much lactose to worry about. The anti egg thing though, that one is stupid, it really is. Chicken eggs are easy to store, last a long time, is a very easy source of protein and contains Vitamin D, the egg is a god damn vital food source for most of the world for a reason and removing it is not going to have positive impact on the health of humanity. Fat is vital, protein is vital, fiber is vital especially for growing children. We are omnivores for a reason and one of those is due to our digestive system, guess what, it is not fantastic when it comes to plants and that is not changing nor will it ever likely change. Nothing but positivity for anyone who wishes to be a vegetarian, go for it, good for you and I hope it does well for your health overall like it does for many. But pure veganism where you cut fish, eggs and dairy is a bit harder for humans health wise and I would not recommend it for people who have certain health issues or for growing children, people wanting to go this route should make sure to talk with their doctor before and during the process.

We should try to shut down all opinion segments masquerading as news (I'm looking at you MSNBC and Fox News) that only exist to misinform the masses, and we should try to input policies that are fair to all. Free schools for all ages, and children are required to attend school until they are [some age of adulthood like 18 or 21]. We need to build houses/apartments for the homeless, make medical care free, and make it so that disability care is available to everyone. Oh, and we definitely need social security, and make housing for old folks. We need to make voting mandatory. And once we do that, all of the Republicans will be butthurt that ""the Dems are stealing all our money"" even though Dems are by-and-large more affluent than they are, and they will be the main benefactors. Ingrates. 😁",UCTmSW3f-1zrL3qWvFuvvM7g,1,UgygOELw-Ngnqg40YMh4AaABAg,S6GodWn4XMM,2018-12-01 21:34:07

It has this almost otherworldly effect on me. When I start thinking about it I can&#39;t contain myself. My excitement bursts forth from within my innermost being. I guess this longing for water is something so primal that it transcends time itself. This longing for water must be coded into the very minutia of our DNA. It has been a part of us for longer than we know. Frankly, I believe this deep lust for it has been a part of us for longer than we&#39;ve even had the idea of an &quot;us.&quot; This lust for water exceeds even the seemingly endless bounds of conscious thought. From the beginning of life itself there has been one common factor in every species, the one thing that unifies all life. For this reason I believe water to be the essence of all things good about the human experience. Happiness, joy, love, hope, togetherness, peace, thought, time, progress, etc. All of these wonderful things are most perfectly found in water. Sometimes, when I am alone and yearning for the embrace of water, I cannot help but ponder the deep cold expanses of water that span most of this place we call home. Truly the sea is our dark mother, the origin of life as we know it. From the very first cell, water was there. This impossibly deep connection between water and the experience of life can lead to only one end, and that end is the realization that to be one with the water is to be one with life as a whole. The paramount experience of existence is to be enveloped by our dark mother, to feel the liquid in every curve and divot in my body, and frankly, as with every divot in my body, the water also fills every divot of my soul and my conscious mind. For this reason alone I believe that as humans, all of us must surrender ourselves to the inherent eroticism of the sea.
