Do you understand how much more advanced our scientific literature is compared to 60 years ago? I'm not a scientist myself, but I am a soon to be doctor (will be taking my medical boards in a year). I can tell you as a medical professional that this rise in CO2 is not compatible with life. When CO2 rises and reacts with water it forms carbonic acid. The same thing happens in patients when they overdose on an acidic medication (say aspirin for example), you will see the patient try and balance the CO2 imbalance by hyperventilating. Our oceans are getting too acidic to support the plankton (where we get about 70% of our oxygen). I cannot think of another issue where nearly every doctor/scientist/researcher has come together and try to help people understand that this is a dire issue on this scale. I can promise you that if the CO2 continues to rise then life will cease to exist. I truly cannot comprehend how people believe that increasing atmospheric CO2 while removing our source of oxygen would be a good idea, but we are in an age of ignorance. If you or anyone else needs an explanation on the science I'll try my best to respond when I get the time.

Deficit is how much the debt increased in a fiscal year. A surplus is how much the debt decreased in a fiscal year. Democratic presidents typically reduce the DEFICIT. GOP presidents almost universally increase the Deficit. The only time in modern history we were running a surplus (causing total debt to go down) was under Bill Clinton. Bush massively increased the deficit year to year. Obama reduced the deficit year to year. Trump has exploded the deficit. Bernie's policies are fiscally responsible because they're cost-saving, economically stimulating and the brunt of costs is offloaded onto wallstreet, corporations and the ultra rich.",UC2TjGwIvCX_dSiP8FQy13CQ,1,UgzsS0mzHONwde_j5KB4AaABAg,CGXkcf1Nv_0,2020-02-27 00:00:01

In a century! So way, way fewer people are dying ""of their teeth"" as was the common verbiage then. We live longer and are much healthier than we were, but some just live longer through medicinal means. Before antibiotics people died of a simple bacterial infection, like strep throat. Before other life saving drugs like insulin, children with type 1 diabetes lived less than five years. Before heart meds allowed for people with heart disease to live longer, it was the most common cause of death. So to say it's the birthrate just doesn't ring true. Because it really, really isn't.

Earth&#39;s global temperature has gone up 0.85 degrees Centigrade since 1880.<br />2. This temperature difference has caused us to be in the midst of the sixth mass extinction with 150 to 200 species per day going extinct. [Greta TEDx 4 mins into it]<br />3. The extra heat equivalent of 4 Hiroshima bombs is added to earth every second, trapped by the CO2 increase of 0.00013 (as a portion of the atmosphere, or 130 ppm increase)<br /><br />Couple questions:<br />1. How was global temperature measured to hundredths of a degree in 1880? Sometimes they explain that pollen counts in ice cores help there. To hundredths of a degree and every year the winds were perfectly the same back then? So then the yearly increase is an incredibly small fraction of 1 degree. Does the sun not vary in frequency ranges like infrared and UV-C? And wasn&#39;t Judith Curry correct in saying she found that undersea volcanoes, which number over 1 million, are not constant in their activity as presumed? So couldn&#39;t the methane from them be a significant factor? And why aren&#39;t we discussing that? Or can cell frequencies increasing everywhere be having an effect? (If so, then we&#39;ll see much more of an effect with 5G). Or how much effect does simply the laying of more asphalt on roads have (dark and absorbing sunshine)? And houses/buildings. So, aren&#39;t there other possible contributing factors like this surely? Or where is the best and most clear description of the CO2 effect that includes experimental proof? And what changes have been occurring to ocean plankton due to human activity? How much is from increased coal burning in China and India essentially from USA outsourcing and corporations moving there for cheap labor that won&#39;t go on strike? They have rivers of plastic pollution over there, easy to google and see the images.<br />2. Where is the list of 1050 to 1400 species that presumably went extinct this past week?<br />3. Who determined worldwide average CO2 from 1880 and how? We bring fossil fuels from underground and burn or explode them (in engine cylinders) and that generates heat, so why is that not the primary discussion rather than a tiny fraction of CO2 moving around? Is CO2 not rather hard to reliably measure worldwide? And so why is population growth not the primary problem being discussed since it is the primary root problem?<br /><br /><br /><br />And a comment: I agree we need to protect our forests better. My understanding is that a large number of arsonists were caught in Australia and the media doesn&#39;t want that known. Many were very young. Brazil should use their army or every tool necessary and stiff fines regarding the Amazon forest in my opinion.<br /><br /><br />In asking questions about this, the attention is often directed at me personally instead of the content of what I&#39;m saying. <br />&quot;I would rather have questions that cannot be answered than answers that dare not be questioned.&quot; --unknown",UCRkQNJYyK073PsjVao-SWCA,0,UgyAN7a3kutrxCPiV_N4AaABAg,CGXkcf1Nv_0,2020-02-27 00:00:01

Many were very young. This was a misrepresentation of the arrests and citations made. While SOME of the fires were believed to have been set deliberately (24 known acts), the vast majority of the arrests made were against individuals who failed to uphold the fire bans being imposed, not deliberate arson. And of the approximately 200 ""arrests"" some of the charges were merely citations for lighting cooking fires in fire-prone regions while not actually causing the spread of the wildfires. According to the New South Wales police, ""53 people have had legal actions for allegedly failing to comply with a total fire ban,” and an additional “47 people have had legal actions for allegedly discarding a lighted cigarette or match on land.” But it's a lot flashier to say that almost 200 counts of arson were committed during Australia's wildfires.
