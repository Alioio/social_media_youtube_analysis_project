In other words, I would like to see where you got your info, because I saw an article were a polar bear scientist said we have triple the amount of polar bears than we did in 1970, but global warming started just 5 years later. You keep hearing people using these numbers, yet they won't give an exact source for these numbers. These numbers are undocumented (Are polar bear populations increasing: in fact, booming?, Dr. Steven C. Amstrup, chief scientist with Polar Bears International and USGS polar bear project leader for 30 years). Dr. Steven Amstrup states again, ""One Russian extrapolation presented in 1956 suggested a number of 5,000 to 8,000, but that figure was never accepted by scientists.""

If you did some reading, you would find that the food situation is a rather big one with polar bears and has forced them to change their diet from seals to other animals and plants. They are after all bears and like coyotes, raccoons, and American bears (brown and black) are extremely adaptable. Lastly, given the condition of the bear the foaming at the mouth is likely a symptom of overexertion and general stress response.

For MOST areas, the populations are now stable, not increasing. Ice bear hunting has also been banned in some countries that do have a significant influence, also due to improved conservation. When scientists say they are 'threatened', it is not of a food scarcity issue (because they're not restricted to a specific arctic diet fyi), but it's the ECOLOGICAL changes to their habitat itself, the melting ice, that affect them and the rest of the ecosystems in northern arctic areas.

Young bears (2 years or so) being pushed away from their mother is at even higher risk since they are not so experienced and is still learning to hunt. At this time they are the most dangerous and if you get attacked by a polar bear it is much likely a younger bear. How horrible this is to watch, this is not uncommon and the way most polar bears die. The are on top of the food chain and no one that can kill them, except other bears or humans. So when a bear die it is usually from starvation due to old age or factors as described above. I would have called the police or who ever give permission to end it&#39;s suffering.

This was near the end of the autumn period in which Beaufort Sea bears reach their peak weights (Durner and Amstrup 1996), and his cohorts at that time weighed in excess of 200 kg.

The economic issue being that developing nations cannot afford ""green"" technology and are heavily reliant on fossil fuels to survive. Of course, when I say they need it to survive, I'm not saying, ""If they can't burn fossil fuels, they won't be able to charge their iPhones."" No, I'm saying, they won't be able to eat, or drink clean water. Second, the science. Something people like you never think about and should because it validates both your bad arguments and my argument can be found in Step 5. ""Global Greening"" as it is called is a process by which increased green house gases actually benefits plant life and allows it to grow successfully in more places than it otherwise would have. I don't know if you know this or not, but farmers who use greenhouses to grow some of their crops during colder months add something like 50-60% more CO2 in order to help the plants grow better... Also, humans are a ""tropical"" species, meaning we tend to live easier lives in tropical climates. Climate change, which is real, (the man made, catastrophic, and fixable without bankrupting the entire world parts are what I struggle with) but it is also opening up huge portions of the world to potential human habitation, like the top half of Canada for instance, or the bottom 1/4 of the Sahara. As a person who puts human flourishing above all else, (which includes having a livable planet!!!) climate change might not be the worst thing that could happen to us...

We were absolutely, without a doubt heading toward another Ice Age. I can remember reading an article about it in Popular Science magazine back then. Fast-forward thirty years. Oops, the scientists have to make a minor adjustment to the theory; it's really Global *Warming* that will destroy the planet. Not just Global Warming, it's man-made Global Warming. Why, if things don't radically change within a decade (or less) the poles will melt and coastal cities will flood. All it will take is an average world-wide increase of 1degree (give or take) to push things to the point of no return. Think Water World. That was the mantra like ten years ago. Well, are folks in New York City all treading water? Are the ice caps gone? No? So what gives? I thought all these famous ""Climate Experts"" like Bill Nye the Climate Guy were on top of this? So maybe the hundreds private jets all these concerned Climatologists take to this or that Climate Conference several times a year spew out a special anti-global-climate-changing exhaust? See, if all this were real, do you think Al Gore and the rest would be taking private jets all over the planet to one Conference or Symposium after another?

Under the Kyoto Protocol, the 'caps' or quotas for Greenhouse gases for the developed Annex 1 countries are known as Assigned Amounts and are listed in Annex B. The quantity of the initial assigned amount is denominated in individual units, called Assigned amount units (AAUs), each of which represents an allowance to emit one metric tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent, and these are entered into the country's national registry. In turn, these countries set quotas on the emissions of installations run by local business and other organizations, generically termed 'operators'. Countries manage this through their national registries, which are required to be validated and monitored for compliance by the UNFCCC. Each operator has an allowance of credits, where each unit gives the owner the right to emit one metric tonne of carbon dioxide or other equivalent greenhouse gas. Operators that have not used up their quotas can sell their unused allowances as carbon credits, while businesses that are about to exceed their quotas can buy the extra allowances as credits, privately or on the open market. As demand for energy grows over time, the total emissions must still stay within the cap, but it allows industry some flexibility and predictability in its planning to accommodate this. By permitting allowances to be bought and sold, an operator can seek out the most cost-effective way of reducing its emissions, either by investing in 'cleaner' machinery and practices or by purchasing emissions from another operator who already has excess 'capacity'. Since 2005, the Kyoto mechanism has been adopted for CO2 trading by all the countries within the European Union under its European Trading Scheme (EU ETS) with the European Commission as its validating authority. From 2008, EU participants must link with the other developed countries who ratified Annex I of the protocol, and trade the six most significant anthropogenic greenhouse gases. In the United States, which has not ratified Kyoto, and Australia, whose ratification came into force in March 2008, similar schemes are being considered.",UCokohgWRT2T1kyIy-BwbDzQ,1,Ugyp0tXQtseRmhEZ4ER4AaABAg,oiC_HG3u-nk,2017-12-09 13:25:11

Cars are far cleaner burning now than they used to be and they get far better fuel mileage than 10 years ago and industrial pollution is at the lowest levels that it‚Äôs been since the industrial revolution. 3) if man is responsible for climate change then why aren‚Äôt we hearing about a slowing of global warming due to the great reductions in our carbon footprint? Instead, all we hear about is that we are increasing the rate at which the earth is warming. Something doesn‚Äôt quite add up there. Also, what‚Äôs wrong with a few degree increase in temperature? Yeah yeah, hurricanes blah blah. I live on the gulf coast in the Florida panhandle and in my 43 years I have been through a few hurricanes but think of the benefits. Farmers could grow more food, have longer growing seasons, grow citrus farther north, fewer deaths from blizzards and people freezing to death, fewer lost work days to snow, fewer accidents from ice. My point is that if the temp ticks up a degree or two, whether it‚Äôs from pollution or natural, we will all be fine.

All of us have sinned against God, we have all like sheep, gone our own way. We have chose something else meaningful to us, in our life to replace God. God is holy, he must punish sin otherwise he's not a holy God. It's no different than a judge, sentencing someone to prison. Even if the person being judged, would bring up all the good deeds he has done. It still doesn't pay for his crimes. So if God were to judge us, we would all be guilty. But God is rich in mercy, he sent his only begotten Son Jesus. To die on the cross for our sins, Jesus took the punishment you and I deserve.

Imagine if we own animals that were going extinct more of them will be alive because the population would be controlled meaning that the owners who sold them wouldn‚Äôt use all of them completely because if he killed them all then he won‚Äôt have anything to sell or make money out of, a smart man would breed more and sell more to make more money, also it‚Äôs more easy to know an exact number instead of an estimated.

In fact livestock produce more greenhouse gases than vehicles do. ""Who is to blame for that?"" You may ask yourself... An idiot would answer the cow, but anyone with a substantial amount of braincells would answer humans, for breeding the cows in the first place, but the majority of people won't stop eating meat, so we have to regulate co2.

(No diseases, health problems, disabilities, etc.) So now that we know that it's the starvation that killed him, there are only a limited amount of options as to how he became so thin. The MOST LIKELY (not saying definitively) option is that it's from a result of climate change, due to the drastic decrease of ice sheets the polar bear most likely ran out of any significant area to hunt for prey (such as seals) that are very important to their diet to maintain their health.

(No diseases, health problems, disabilities, etc.) So now that we know that it's the starvation that killed him, there are only a limited amount of options as to how he became so thin. The MOST LIKELY (not saying definitively) option is that it's from a result of climate change, due to the drastic decrease of ice sheets the polar bear most likely ran out of any significant area to hunt for prey (such as seals) that are very important to their diet to maintain their health. Thus, casuign the bear to starve.

(No diseases, health problems, disabilities, etc.) So now that we know that it's the starvation that killed him, there are only a limited amount of options as to how he became so thin. The MOST LIKELY (not saying definitively) option is that it's from a result of climate change, due to the drastic decrease of ice sheets the polar bear most likely ran out of any significant area to hunt for prey (such as seals) that are very important to their diet to maintain their health. Thus, casuign the bear to starve.

The MOST LIKELY (not saying definitively) option is that it's from a result of climate change, due to the drastic decrease of ice sheets the polar bear most likely ran out of any significant area to hunt for prey (such as seals) that are very important to their diet to maintain their health.

The MOST LIKELY (not saying definitively) option is that it's from a result of climate change, due to the drastic decrease of ice sheets the polar bear most likely ran out of any significant area to hunt for prey (such as seals) that are very important to their diet to maintain their health.

You can also see that in the structure and fur it's not a very old bear at all. What might look like 'old age' at first glance is actually muscular atrophy due to starvation. You can see by the way that the skin clings to the bone and the muscles are worn down heavily. In an older animal these things will happen but not as much as we're seeing in the video and not in the same ways.

If the polar bear population decreases dramatically, then we could see a proliferation of the polar bears prey which can likely cause a chain reaction of endangered species and prolific species. The polar bear eats the seal, no polar bears, more seals. The seals eat squid, crustaceans, Molluscs and other fish. More seals, less calamari, lobster, crab, and other delicious seafood.
