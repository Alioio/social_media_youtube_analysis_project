They have somehow been granted a large piece of territory overtime and they do profit from that in many financial ways.

There are opposing views of development at war. The common view that places economic development at odds with natural conservation is called extractivist development. Theirs is ecocentric and it understands the concequences of extractivist development, because they feel them directly and never seem to reap the so-called rewards when they do sacrifice a piece of land to soy monoculture or illegal logging... it's not bias so much as experience. I'm from Canada, and we have the same issues with viewing first nations and indigenous locals as less knowledgeable than us when it comes to land usage and management, but they're not the ones causing global warming, or flooding rivers with toxic mining residue... They're the ones that showed you how to get rubber from seringeira trees, without them, no ciclo da borracha, and yet they suffered more from helping you out, being brought into slavery and decimated by violent encroaching on their lands all over south america. That still goes on to this day, as indigenous communities still fight back those encroachers, who are armed with more than just great speeches on development.. The majority of environmental activists murdered in the world are murdered in the brazilian campo... Just because your elites keep you poor and undereducated, doesn't mean you can just steal other people's lands and destroy them for profit. And you can't steal people's stuff and then ask them to pay you, can't have the bread and the money for the bread... one or another's gotta give. But respect where respect is due, know your own history, consider how much these ""biased"" people have endured before judging their way of life as unproductive and thus, unworthy of protection. Land management as we know it was invented in England before the industrial revolution (agrarian capitalism, ""improvement"", privatization of communal lands, ""far west"" policies, etc.), and what was right for them then (arguably) can't be right for everyone everywhere at all times. Maximizing land usage and concentrating it into the hands of the few is a problem and a main cause of poverty, not a solution to poverty. Small farmers clear the land, but latifundios buy them back, they do the hard work and can never really reap the benefits either. It's a well studied structure... ""Free development"" of the Amazon is the worse case scenario, for all parties... it will not lead to more social justice, never has, never will.",UCKkcQmM9k8mXaPE8VtHmZkQ,1,UgwoftwT1s07go3ng_t4AaABAg,ZjCrbHrNdJ8,2019-05-01 15:42:30

It&#39;s easy to point the finger at Brazil because it still has 60% of their territory in pristine conditions, when those criticising and pointing their fingers live in nations that have completely depleted their land resources, arguably becoming developed for doing exactly that. You want the Amazon preserved? How about financially incentivising Brazil to NOT use their own resources? How about taxing the rich nations that emit the CO2 the Brazilian Amazon helps reabsorb? How about that CO2 tax? In the mean time... go ahead Brazil, take advantage of your resources in whichever means necessary to better the lives of your own people.. do the exact same way all the other nations are doing.

Therefore my argument is still the same, as long as the wealthy nations and the megarich don't do their fair share they shouldn't be pointing their fingers at the little guy trying to grow. Sure the deforestation will like make a few extremely wealthy.. But as long as the poor make 1% more than they did the year before, that 1% might equal feeding their children better or going hungry. It means nothing to you, but it means the world to them. Btw Brazil signed the Paris agreement, what world superpower didn't because it would ""hinder"" their growth? I say if other nations won't reach an agreement, Brazil should act on their own benefits. Even if it means we are all doomed in the end.",UCJXXukcQ9E9Cai8hjl2PQeA,1,UgyVcE-X77kSlyVC_954AaABAg,ZjCrbHrNdJ8,2019-05-01 15:42:30
